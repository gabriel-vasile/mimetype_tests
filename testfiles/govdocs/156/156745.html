<P>QUESTIONS PRESENTED</P>

<P>1. Whether the Sixth Amendment is violated by the imposition of an enhanced
sentence under the United States Sentencing Guidelines based on the sentencing
judge's determination of a fact (other than a prior conviction) that was
not found by the jury or admitted by the defendant.</P>

<P>2. If the answer to the first question is &quot;yes,&quot; the following
question is presented: whether, in a case in which the Guidelines would
require the court to find a sentence-enhancing fact, the Sentencing Guidelines
as a whole would be inapplicable, as a matter of severability analysis,
such that the sentencing court must exercise its discretion to sentence
the defendant within the maximum and minimum set by statute for the offense
of conviction.</P>

<P>ON PETITION FOR A WRIT OF CERTIORARI<BR>
TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS<BR>
FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT<BR>
</P>

<P>PETITION FOR A WRIT OF CERTIORARI</P>

<P>The Acting Solicitor General, on behalf of the United States, petitions
for a writ of certiorari to review the judgment of the United States Court
of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in this case.</P>

<P>OPINION BELOW</P>

<P>The opinion of the court of appeals (App., infra, 1a-27a) is not yet
reported in the Federal Reporter, but is available in 2004 WL 1535858.</P>

<P>JURISDICTION</P>

<P>The judgment of the court of appeals was entered on July 9, 2004. The
jurisdiction of this Court is invoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1).</P>

<P>CONSTITUTIONAL, STATUTORY, AND GUIDELINES PROVISIONS INVOLVED</P>

<P>The relevant constitutional, statutory, and Sentencing Guidelines provisions
involved are set forth in an appendix to the petition. App., infra, 31a-64a.</P>

<P>STATEMENT</P>

<P>After a jury trial in the United States District Court for the Western
District of Wisconsin, respondent was convicted of possessing at least 50
grams of cocaine base with the intent to distribute it, in violation of
21 U.S.C. 841(a) and 841(b)(1)(A)(iii), and distributing cocaine base, in
violation of 21 U.S.C. 841(a)(1). He was sentenced to 360 months of imprisonment,
to be followed by five years of supervised release. A divided court of appeals
reversed and remanded for resentencing. App., infra, 1a-27a.</P>

<P>1. The underlying facts</P>

<P>On February 26, 2003, respondent sold a quantity of crack cocaine to
a customer at the residence of a third party. Before the customer could
leave, police officers responding to a criminal trespass complaint arrived
and knocked on the door. The officers observed that the customer attempted
to swallow what turned out to be crack cocaine. Respondent was apprehended
outside the house and detained. Ultimately, the officers found a duffle
bag that respondent admitted was his. The bag contained approximately $400,
drug paraphernalia, and 92.5 grams of crack cocaine. Respondent gave a written
statement to the police in which he admitted selling an additional 20 ounces
(566 grams) of crack cocaine. Gov't C.A. Br. 7-10, 11-12; Presentence Report
(PSR) 3-4.</P>

<P>2. The district court proceedings</P>

<P>On March 12, 2003, respondent was charged in a two-count indictment in
the Western District of Wisconsin with possessing more than 50 grams of
cocaine base with intent to distribute it and with distributing cocaine
base, both in violation of 21 U.S.C. 841(a)(1). The jury found respondent
guilty on both counts. The Presentence Report initially recommended that
respondent be held responsible for possession of the 92.5 grams of crack
cocaine that was found in his duffle bag. PSR 6. That would have resulted
in an offense level of 32 under the United States Sentencing Guidelines.
See Sentencing Guidelines &sect; 2D1.1(c)(4). In an addendum, the PSR adopted
the government's position that respondent's relevant conduct under the Guidelines,
see Sentencing Guidelines &sect; 1B1.3, should also include the 20 additional
ounces of crack cocaine that respondent had admitted selling. Gov't C.A.
Br. 11-12.</P>

<P>At sentencing, the court held respondent responsible for the 20 additional
ounces of crack cocaine. Sent. Tr. 7-8. That resulted in a total of 658.5
grams of crack cocaine, and an offense level of 36 under Sentencing Guidelines
&sect; 2D1.1(c)(2). See Sent. Tr. 7. The court added two additional levels
for obstruction of justice under Sentencing Guidelines &sect; 3C1.1, based
on the court's finding that respondent had perjured himself at trial when
he &quot;knowingly denied any of the elements of the offense,&quot; in contradiction
of the written statement he had made to the police on the day of his arrest.
Sent. Tr. 9-10. Based on his extensive prior record, which included 23 prior
convictions, respondent was placed in criminal history category VI. Id.
at 9; PSR 6-16. His sentencing range was 360 months to life imprisonment.
The court imposed a sentence of 360 months of imprisonment. Sent. Tr. 11.</P>

<P>3. The court of appeals' decision</P>

<P>a. On appeal, respondent initially argued that he was entitled to a new
trial because the district court had erroneously limited his cross-examination
of a government witness and that he was entitled to a new sentencing hearing
because his sentence was based on his purportedly unreliable written statement
made to police officers on the day of his arrest. Resp. C.A. Br. 13-27.</P>

<P>On June 24, 2004, this Court issued its decision in Blakely v. Washington,
124 S. Ct. 2531. Six days later, on respondent's motion for supplemental
briefing, the court of appeals ordered both parties to file briefs by July
2 addressing the applicability of Blakely to this case. Respondent argued
that the the Sixth Amendment entitled him to be sentenced within the Guidelines
range for defendants responsible for 92.5 grams of crack cocaine (rather
than the 658.5 grams found by the judge) and that he was entitled to be
sentenced without the two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice.
The government argued that Blakely is inapplicable to the Guidelines. The
court heard oral argument on July 6.1</P>

<P>b. On July 9, 2004, a divided panel of the court of appeals affirmed
respondent's conviction, reversed his sentence, and remanded for further
proceedings. The court &quot;expedited [its] decision in an effort to provide
some guidance to the district judges (and our own court's staff), who are
faced with an avalanche of motions for resentencing in the light of&quot;
Blakely-which, the court stated, had &quot;cast a long shadow over the federal
sentencing guidelines.&quot; App., infra, 2a.</P>

<P>The court began by reciting this Court's holding in Apprendi v. New Jersey,
530 U.S. 466, 490 (2000), that &quot;[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction,
any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory
maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.&quot;
App., infra, 3a. The court continued that in Blakely, this Court stated
that &quot;the 'statutory maximum' for Apprendi purposes is the maximum
sentence a judge may impose solely on the basis of the facts reflected in
the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.&quot; Ibid. (quoting Blakely,
124 S. Ct. at 2537). Under those holdings, the court concluded, &quot;[t]he
maximum sentence that the district judge could have imposed in this case
(without an upward departure), had he not made any findings concerning quantity
of drugs or obstruction of justice, would have been 262 months, given [respondent's]
base offense level of 32 * * * and the defendant's criminal history&quot;
under the Guidelines. App., infra, 3a-4a. The court thus determined that,
absent the defendant's consent, Blakely precluded the judge from making
additional factual findings that would increase respondent's Guidelines
sentence. Id. at 9a.</P>

<P>The court rejected a distinction between the federal guidelines at issue
here and the state statutory guidelines at issue in Blakely based on &quot;the
fact that the [federal] guidelines are promulgated by the U.S. Sentencing
Commission rather than by a legislature.&quot; App., infra, 4a. &quot;The
Commission is exercising power delegated to it by Congress,&quot; the court
reasoned, &quot;and if a legislature cannot evade what the Supreme Court
deems the commands of the Constitution by a multistage sentencing scheme
neither, it seems plain, can a regulatory agency.&quot; Ibid. The court
also rejected the contention that this Court's prior decisions in Edwards
v. United States, 523 U.S. 511 (1998), and United States v. Watts, 519 U.S.
148 (1997) (per curiam), established the constitutionality of judicial factfinding
that supports sentence enhancements under the Guidelines. App., infra, 9a-11a.</P>

<P>The court concluded that &quot;the guidelines, though only in cases such
as the present one in which they limit defendants' right to a jury and to
the reasonable-doubt standard * * * violate the Sixth Amendment as interpreted
by Blakely.&quot; App., infra, 8a-9a. Accordingly, the court held, respondent
&quot;has a right to have the jury determine the quantity of drugs he possessed
and the facts underlying the determination that he obstructed justice.&quot;
Id. at 11a.</P>

<P>The court then remanded the case to the district court for resentencing.
It noted that, if the government sought a higher Guidelines sentence than
262 months of imprisonment, the district court would have to determine whether
the &quot;the aspect of the guidelines that [the court] believe[s] to be
unconstitutional, namely the requirement that the sentencing judge make
certain findings that shall operate as the premise of the sentence and that
he make them on the basis of the preponderance of the evidence, may not
be severable from the substantive provisions of the guidelines.&quot; App.,
infra, 12a. If that were the case, then &quot;the guidelines would be invalid
in their entirety&quot; and the district judge would be &quot;free as he
was before the guidelines were promulgated to fix any sentence within the
statutory range.&quot; Id. at 13a. Stating that the severability issue had
&quot;not been briefed or argued,&quot; however, the court declined to address
it. Ibid. The court also declined to resolve procedural issues that might
surround any effort to conduct a jury trial on the enhancement factors if
the Guidelines were found to be severable. Id. at 12a.</P>

<P>The court of appeals thus held that &quot;[t]he application of the guidelines
in this case violated the Sixth Amendment as interpreted in Blakely.&quot;
App., infra, 13a. But the court noted that it could not be &quot;certain&quot;
that its holding was correct. Id. at 9a. &quot;If our decision is wrong,&quot;
the court concluded, &quot;may the Supreme Court speedily reverse it.&quot;
Ibid.2</P>

<P>c. Judge Easterbrook dissented. He disagreed with the majority &quot;on
both procedural and substantive grounds.&quot; App., infra, 14a. As a matter
of procedure, he concluded that the court of appeals had no authority to
hold the Guidelines unconstitutional because any such holding would be inconsistent
with this Court's cases, including Edwards, supra, which &quot;held that
a judge * * * may ascertain (using the preponderance standard) the type
and amount of drugs involved, and impose a sentence based on that conclusion,
as long as the sentence does not exceed the statutory maximum.&quot; Id.
at 15a.</P>

<P>Substantively, Judge Easterbrook noted that this Court had repeatedly
described the Apprendi rule as triggering Sixth Amendment protections for
facts that increase the &quot;statutory maximum.&quot; See App., infra,
18a (emphasis added) (citing Apprendi, 530 U.S. at 490; Blakely, 124 S.
Ct. at 2537). In this case, he noted, Congress established the statutory
maximum penalties for drug offenses in 21 U.S.C. 841(b). App., infra, 18a.
The Guidelines, he reasoned, do not reduce that statutory authorization,
but instead affect sentencing only after the degree of the offense has been
established by the jury. Id. at 22a.</P>

<P>Judge Easterbrook also noted that, &quot;[g]iven the matrix-like nature
of the [Sentencing Guidelines] system and the possibility of departure,&quot;
App., infra, 23a, &quot;[e]ven if Blakely's definition reaches regulations
adopted by a body such as the Sentencing Commission, it requires an extra
step (or three) to say that the jury must make the dozens of findings that
matter to the Guidelines' operation in each case.&quot; Id. at 24a. Judge
Easterbrook did not believe that Blakely had taken that step. Ibid.</P>

<P>REASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION</P>

<P>This Court's decision in Blakely v. Washington, 124 S. Ct. 2531 (2004),
has profoundly unsettled the federal criminal justice system. Blakely held
that a Washington state sentence was imposed in violation of the Sixth Amendment
jury-trial right because the sentencing judge was permitted to find an aggravating
fact that authorized a higher sentence than the state statutory guidelines
system otherwise permitted. Id. at 2537-2538. The Court noted that &quot;[t]he
Federal Guidelines are not before us, and we express no opinion on them.&quot;
Id. at 2538 n.9. The Court's decision in Blakely, however, has &quot;cast
a long shadow over the federal sentencing guidelines.&quot; App., infra,
2a. In particular, it has roiled the federal courts by raising doubts about
the constitutionality of routine Guidelines sentencing procedures, employed
for fifteen years since Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 396 (1989),
under which sentencing judges find the facts necessary to arrive at a Guidelines
sentencing range for each defendant.</P>

<P>The result has been a wave of instability in the federal sentencing system
that has left the government, defendants, and the courts without clear guidance
on how to conduct the thousands of federal criminal sentencings that are
scheduled each month. The sheer volume of federal sentencings has resulted
in virtually unprecedented uncertainty. The courts facing the problem have
developed a range of mutually inconsistent approaches to federal sentencing.
Those conflicting approaches could lead to the need for thousands-or even
tens of thousands-of resentencing proceedings once the legal issues are
settled. It could also lead to debilitating uncertainty about the proper
length of federal sentences, which could cripple other aspects of the system,
including plea bargaining practice. Ultimately, the uncertainty could hinder
achievement of the crucial social goals at stake in the criminal justice
system. The courts of appeals have already fallen into conflict over the
implications of Blakely and one court of appeals has taken the extraordinary
step of certifying questions to this Court in an effort to obtain authoritative
guidance on the meaning of Blakely for federal sentencing. Further review
is warranted on an expedited basis to help restore a stable footing to the
federal system of criminal justice.</P>

<P>A. Blakely Has Unsettled Understandings About The Inapplicability Of
Apprendi To The Sentencing Guidelines</P>

<P>In Blakely, the defendant was convicted in state court on his guilty
plea to second-degree kidnapping, in which he admitted the use of a firearm.
One Washington statute authorized a maximum term of ten years of imprisonment
for the kidnapping offense. The state's statutory sentencing guidelines
system, however, established a range of 49-53 months of imprisonment for
his offense of second-degree kidnapping with a firearm, absent a judicial
finding, by the preponderance of the evidence, of a &quot;substantial and
compelling reason[] justifying an exceptional sentence.&quot; 124 S. Ct.
at 2535. The sentencing court found that Blakely's offense involved &quot;deliberate
cruelty&quot; that justified an exceptional sentence and on that basis imposed
a 90-month sentence. Interpreting the rule that it had first announced in
Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 490 (2000) (&quot;Other than the fact
of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond
the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved
beyond a reasonable doubt.&quot;), and then applied in Ring v. Arizona,
536 U.S. 584, 602 (2002), the Court held in Blakely that, because &quot;[t]he
facts supporting that finding [of deliberate cruelty] were neither admitted
by [the defendant] nor found by a jury,&quot; 124 S. Ct. at 2537, the &quot;State's
sentencing procedure did not comply with the Sixth Amendment,&quot; id.
at 2538. The Court stated that &quot;the 'statutory maximum' for Apprendi
purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose solely on the basis
of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.&quot;
Id. at 2537. See ibid. (&quot;[T]he relevant 'statutory maximum' is not
the maximum sentence a judge may impose after finding additional facts,
but the maximum he may impose without any additional findings.&quot;).</P>

<P>The Court in Blakely did not reach the question whether Blakely applies
to the federal Sentencing Guidelines. 124 S. Ct. at 2538 n.9. But the dissenting
opinions stated that the majority's reasoning placed the Guidelines in jeopardy.
Id. at 2549-2550 (O'Connor, J., dissenting); id. at 2561 (Breyer, J., dissenting).
Blakely has indeed had the effect of raising questions about the Guidelines'
validity that had previously been regarded as settled.</P>

<P>After this Court's decision four years ago in Apprendi, defendants frequently
argued that the Sixth Amendment is violated when the judge makes a factual
finding under the Sentencing Guidelines that increases the defendant's sentencing
range and that results in a more severe sentence than would have been justified
based solely on the facts found by the jury. Before Blakely, every court
of appeals with criminal jurisdiction rejected that argument.3 The uniform
course of appellate decisions reasoned that &quot;the holding in Apprendi
applies only when the disputed 'fact' enlarges the applicable statutory
maximum and the defendant's sentence exceeds the original maximum.&quot;
United States v. Caba, 241 F.3d 98, 101 (1st Cir. 2001). Because the Sentencing
Guidelines cap the defendant's sentence at the maximum provided by statute
for the offense of conviction, see Sentencing Guidelines &sect; 5G1.1(a);
28 U.S.C. 994(b)(1) (Guidelines sentencing range must be &quot;consistent
with all pertinent provisions of title 18&quot;), the Guidelines never lead
to the imposition of a sentence on a particular count that exceeds the statutory
maximum. For that reason, the courts of appeals uniformly held that judicial
factfinding in the application of the Guidelines at sentencing is constitutional
under Apprendi. This Court's decision in Blakely shattered that consensus.</P>

<P>B. The Courts Of Appeals Are In Conflict Over The Applicability Of Blakely
To Federal Guidelines Sentencing</P>

<P>In the 27 days since Blakely, the federal courts have been thrown into
conflict on the continuing validity of the current federal sentencing regime.
One court of appeals has held that the current regime is unconstitutional
in a wide range of cases. A second court of appeals has upheld the validity
of the Guidelines consistent with this Court's prior precedent and suggested
that any implications of Blakely for the Guidelines must be drawn by this
Court, rather than the lower federal courts. A third court of appeals, sitting
en banc, has taken the extraordinary step of certifying questions to this
Court, urging it to grant expedited review to settle the applicability of
Blakely to judicial factfinding that results in upward adjustments under
the Sentencing Guidelines. Two other courts of appeals have already granted
en banc consideration of the issue.</P>

<P>1. In this case, the Seventh Circuit determined that respondent's increased
Guidelines sentence, based on the sentencing court's finding of facts as
required under the Guidelines, denied respondent his right to a jury trial
under Blakely, and that, therefore, &quot;[t]he application of the guidelines
in this case violated the Sixth Amendment.&quot; App., infra, 13a. The court
of appeals reserved judgment on the impact of Blakely on cases in which
no additional fact finding beyond the jury verdict is necessary to apply
the Guidelines. Id. at 9a, 13a. But the court's holding still applies to
a large number of federal criminal cases, in which the defendant's sentence
under the Guidelines is increased by the sentencing court's factual findings
(other than a prior conviction), and the defendant has not consented to
factfinding by the judge.4</P>

<P>2. In contrast, the Fifth Circuit reached the opposite conclusion in
United States v. Pineiro, 2004 WL 1543170 (July 12, 2004). In that case,
the sentencing court made certain factual findings about drug quantity and
the defendant's role in the offense that resulted in a much higher sentencing
range under the Guidelines than would have been applicable based on the
facts found by the jury alone. The Fifth Circuit affirmed the sentence,
concluding that &quot;[h]aving considered the Blakely decision, prior Supreme
Court cases, and our own circuit precedent, we hold that Blakely does not
extend to the federal Guidelines and that [the defendant's] sentence did
not violate the Constitution.&quot; Id. at *1. The court stated that it
&quot;d[id] not believe that the Sentencing Commission can be thought of
as having created for each United States Code section a hundred different
Apprendi 'offenses' corresponding to the myriad possible permutations of
Guidelines factors, with each 'offense' then requiring jury findings on
all of its (Guidelines-supplied) elements.&quot; 2004 WL 1543170, at *9.5</P>

<P>3. The disarray in the circuits is highlighted by the en banc Second
Circuit's extraordinary order certifying to this Court questions pertaining
to whether Blakely applies to sentencing under the Guidelines. United States
v. Penaranda, 2004 WL 1551369 (2d Cir. July 12, 2004), certification docketed,
No. 04-59 (July 13, 2004). The court of appeals found that it &quot;cannot
be certain whether a majority of [this] Court would extend the reasoning
of Blakely&quot; to the Guidelines. Id. at *4. The court observed that,
while &quot;[s]ome portions of the majority opinion in Blakely indicate
that the decision does apply to the federal Sentencing Guidelines[,] * *
* the distinct administrative provenance of the federal Sentencing Guidelines
may place them outside the ambit of the Blakely principle.&quot; Id. at
*5. And &quot;even if Blakely applies to some aspects of sentencing under
the Guidelines, it is unclear whether judicial fact-finding that determines
the applicable Guidelines range is prohibited.&quot; Id. at *6.</P>

<P>The Second Circuit did not reach its own conclusions in Penaranda. Rather,
it believed that the degree of uncertainty about the implications of Blakely
raised such serious difficulties for the administration of criminal justice
that this Court should have &quot;an opportunity to adjudicate promptly
the threshold issue of whether Blakely applies to the federal Sentencing
Guidelines.&quot; 2004 WL 1551369, at *7. To that end, the en banc court
certified questions to this Court under 28 U.S.C. 1254(2) and urged it to
&quot;entertain this certification * * * at [the Court's] earliest convenience,
with an expedited briefing and hearing schedule * * * in order to minimize,
to the extent possible, what we see as an impending crisis in the administration
of criminal justice in the federal courts.&quot; Id. at *8. The recognition
by the Second Circuit that, without a Supreme Court ruling, &quot;defendants,
victims, and the public will be left uncertain about what sentences are
lawful,&quot; 2004 WL 1551369, at *7, underscores the need for prompt intervention
by this Court.6</P>

<P>C. The Lower Federal Courts Are Acutely In Need Of Guidance On The Proper
Sentencing Procedures If Blakely Is Found Applicable To The Sentencing Guidelines</P>

<P>The Court should also grant review to settle the question that necessarily
arises if this Court were to hold, contrary to the government's position,
that the principles of Blakely preclude a sentencing court (absent the defendant's
consent) from finding facts (other than a prior conviction) that increase
a defendant's sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines beyond the level
indicated based solely on the jury's findings or the defendant's admissions.
That remedial question need not be reached if the Court agrees with the
government that the federal system is distinguishable from the state statutory
guidelines system at issue in Blakely. But if the Court were to disagree,
the remedial issues that follow would be of critical importance to restoring
order to the federal sentencing system. Indeed, a holding by this Court
that Blakely applies to the Guidelines, without any guidance on the remedial
consequences, would threaten to paralyze federal sentencing or compel an
enormous waste of resources as courts struggle with &quot;various attempts
to implement Blakely [that] ultimately may prove misguided.&quot; Penaranda,
2004 WL 1551369, at *7.</P>

<P>1. The most important question would be one of severability. When a court
finds some parts of a statutory scheme unconstitutional, the court must
inquire into the severability of the remaining provisions. Alaska Airlines,
Inc. v. Brock, 480 U.S. 678, 684 (1987). The question whether the unconstitutional
provisions are severable turns on an assessment of whether Congress would
have enacted the remaining provisions absent the others. See Minnesota v.
Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians, 526 U.S. 172, 191 (1999) (&quot;The
inquiry into whether a statute is severable is essentially an inquiry into
legislative intent.&quot;). When &quot;it is evident that the Legislature
would not have enacted those provisions which are within its power, independently
of that which is not,&quot; Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 108 (1976) (quoting
Champlin Refining Co. v. Corporation Comm'n, 286 U.S. 210, 234 (1932)),
a statutory scheme is not severable and cannot stand in the face of the
unconstitutionality of particular features. Under that analysis, if Blakely
renders unconstitutional a judge's assessment of facts that increase a defendant's
Guidelines sentence, the balance of the Sentencing Guidelines is not severable
from the unconstitutional judicial factfinding procedures.</P>

<P>The novel scheme that would result from superimposing jury trials on
the Guidelines sentencing process would give birth to a radically different
system from the one that Congress enacted and the Sentencing Commission
created. The Guidelines serve the important goal of seeking to avoid unwarranted
sentencing disparities between similarly situated defendants resulting from
divergent judicial decisions in an indeterminate sentencing system. See
Koon v. United States, 518 U.S. 81, 92 (1996); 28 U.S.C. 991(b)(1)(B); S.
Rep. No. 225, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. 52 (1983). The Guidelines were plainly
designed and written for application by judges, e.g., 28 U.S.C. 994(a)(1);
Sentencing Guidelines &sect; 6A1.3(b), and their complexity and holistic
nature would defy coherent application with an overlay of Blakely procedures.
The transformation of the jury into the factfinder on the myriad of issues
that the Guidelines often require to be resolved would introduce procedural
complications (e.g., bifurcation, complicated jury instructions, elaborate
special verdicts) that the federal system has never applied in the ordinary
case. To superimpose Blakely on the Guidelines in pending cases awaiting
sentencing could have the effect of precluding most upward adjustments that
the Guidelines would require, because, as the court of appeals noted, there
could be double jeopardy objections to reconvening a jury to decide facts
relevant only to upward adjustments at sentencing. App., infra, 12a. That
would seriously thwart the intention of Congress and the Commission to provide
for sentences sufficient &quot;to reflect the seriousness of the offense,
to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense,&quot;
&quot;to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct,&quot; and &quot;to
protect the public from further crimes of the defendant.&quot; 18 U.S.C.
3553(a)(2)(A), (B), and (C).</P>

<P>Accordingly, in any case in which Blakely would preclude the sentencing
court from making findings required under the Guidelines, the Guidelines
as a whole cannot be implemented as intended, and the court should therefore
sentence the defendant in its discretion within the maximum and minimum
provided by statute for the offense of conviction. In doing so, the court
should pay due regard to the relevant Guidelines provisions, as an informed
and expert body of knowledge on sentencing issues.</P>

<P>2. Although the court of appeals in this case did not resolve how the
district court should proceed on remand, the court recognized that the government's
position that the Guidelines are not severable &quot;may be right&quot;
and that &quot;the requirement that the sentencing judge make certain findings
that shall operate as the premise of the sentence and that he make them
on the basis of the preponderance of the evidence * * * may not be severable
from the substantive provisions of the guidelines.&quot; App., infra, 12a.
In United States v. Croxford, 2004 WL 1521560 (D. Utah July 7, 2004), Judge
Cassell reached that holding, concluding that the Guidelines were not severable.
After a careful analysis of the options facing the court, see 2004 WL 1521560,
at *10-*13, the court concluded that, in cases where the Guidelines require
judicial factfinding on upward adjustments, id. at *9, it would sentence
the defendant &quot;by making a full examination of the relevant evidence
and imposing an appropriate sentence within the statutory range set by Congress,&quot;
id. at *13, while considering the &quot;Guidelines as providing useful instruction
on the appropriate sentence,&quot; id. at *15.7</P>

<P>3. In contrast, other courts that have applied Blakely to the Guidelines
have persisted in applying the Guidelines framework, but have limited the
sentencing court to the imposition only of a Guidelines sentence whose maximum
term is supported by jury findings or admissions by the defendant. United
States v. Shamblin, 2004 WL 1468561, at *8 (S.D. W.Va. June 30, 2004), exemplifies
this approach. There, the court found that &quot;the upper bound of the
appropriate [Guidelines] sentencing range, based on facts proven to a jury
beyond a reasonable doubt or admitted by the defendant, establishes the
relevant statutory maximum for Apprendi purposes.&quot; 2004 WL 1468561,
at *8. The court conceded that that approach leads to &quot;an artificial
application of the Guidelines&quot; because &quot;in drug cases, the amounts
of offense conduct and relevant conduct are integral to the determination
of sentencing range.&quot; Ibid. The court nonetheless believed that it
was bound to apply the Guidelines in that manner, and therefore reduced
the defendant's sentence from imprisonment for 20 years to imprisonment
for twelve months. Id. at *9.8</P>

<P>Under many Guidelines provisions, conviction of an offense, standing
alone, triggers a low base offense level, with higher sentences keyed to
a judge's findings that the offense involved aggravating factors. Under
the fraud Guideline, for example, the base offense level is six or seven,
corresponding to a sentence of 0-6 months of imprisonment, for conviction
of a fraud offense, but the level can be increased up to 30 levels for the
amount of the loss and other aggravating factors. Sentencing Guidelines
&sect; 2B1.1. At least in pending cases, in which the jury will not have
found the aggravating facts, a conclusion that the Guidelines are severable
could produce absurdly low sentences for very serious criminal conduct.
See United States v. Einstman, 2004 WL 1576622, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. July 14,
2004) (&quot;[I]t seems evident * * * that Congress would never have countenanced
a Guidelines system in which all first-time offenders who pled guilty to
the elements of wire, mail or bank fraud, and nothing more, were limited
to a sentence of 0-6 months * * * without regard to the amount of the fraud,
its sophistication, or the role played by the defendant in the conspiracy.
Such sentences make a mockery of the real (not 'relevant') statutory maxima
that have been set by the Legislative Branch, and effectively eviscerate
Congress's expressed intention that * * * a schemer who defrauds his employer
be eligible for as much as five years in prison.&quot;).</P>

<P>4. Still other alternatives are possible. The court of appeals in this
case observed that one potential approach would be to convene &quot;a sentencing
hearing at which a jury will have to find by proof beyond a reasonable doubt
the facts on which a higher sentence would be premised.&quot; App., infra,
11a. The court noted, however, that doing so would raise questions in any
case, such as the present one, in which the necessary facts have not been
alleged in the indictment. Id. at 12a. See also Penaranda, 2004 WL 1551369,
at *7 (noting possibility of &quot;recalling the jury that convicted the
defendant to determine whether the facts warranting an enhancement under
the Guidelines have been proven&quot;). No sentencing court can be confident
that any particular approach it selects will survive review under the rule
ultimately laid down by this Court.</P>

<P>D. The Questions Presented Are Of Enormous Importance</P>

<P>The questions presented in this case are of great public importance and
warrant immediate resolution.</P>

<P>1. First, a potentially enormous number of cases is involved. There are
approximately 64,000 federal criminal defendants sentenced under the Guidelines
each year. See United States Sentencing Comm'n, 2002 Sourcebook of Federal
Sentencing Statistics, at Table 2. That means that an average of approximately
1200 federal sentencings take place each week. Given the current disarray,
a very large percentage of those cases may result in unlawful sentences.
The number of federal cases affected by the questions presented in this
case will increase daily until this Court is able to address the issues.</P>

<P>Second, the Court's resolution of the questions presented will significantly
affect the length of sentences in many of those cases. In the short time
since Blakely, many courts have reduced sentences below otherwise-applicable
Guidelines levels; other courts have elected to move to indeterminate sentencing;
and still others have adhered to the Sentencing Guidelines. The effect on
the sentence can be substantial.</P>

<P>Third, the uncertainty about how to proceed with federal sentencing imposes
burdens on prosecutors, defense counsel, and federal trial and appellate
courts. Especially insofar as courts attempt to apply the Guidelines with
a Blakely overlay of jury findings, a host of complicated procedural issues
must be confronted. These would include instructing the jury on Guidelines
factors that were never intended for its use (see, e.g., the Relevant Conduct
Guideline, &sect; 1B1.3, and its nine pages of application notes); possibly
bifurcating the trial into guilt and sentencing phases; and determining
the proper procedures for Blakely waivers in guilty pleas. All of these
issues, and many more, will be fruitful sources for extensive litigation
and appeals. All this could turn out to be unnecessary depending on this
Court's resolution of the questions presented.</P>

<P>Fourth, the ramifications of the current instability are unsettling areas
beyond sentencing. Although approximately 97.1% of federal criminal cases
are ordinarily resolved by guilty pleas, see United States Sentencing Comm'n,
supra, at Fig. C, uncertainty about the sentencing regime that will be applied
has made it more difficult for the government and defendants to reach plea
agreements. Some defendants may decide to stand trial, rather than enter
a plea without knowing what sentencing process will apply to them.9 The
volume of criminal cases means that even a modest shift from pleas to trials
could have enormous consequences for the federal system. Even an increase
from 3% to 6% in the number of defendants who stand trial would double the
volume of cases that must be adjudicated. That increase would greatly aggravate
the burden on courts, prosecutors, defendants, and defense counsel.</P>

<P>2. Although the courts of appeals have disagreed on the merits, they
have agreed on the need for this Court's prompt action. See App., infra,
2a (&quot;We cannot of course provide definitive guidance; only the Court
and Congress can do that.&quot;); Pineiro, 2004 WL 1543170, at *9 (&quot;We
trust that the question presented in cases like this one will soon receive
a more definitive answer from the Supreme Court, which can resolve the current
state of flux and uncertainty; and then, if necessary, Congress can craft
a uniform, rational, nationwide response.&quot;). As Judge Easterbrook noted,
the &quot;likely consequence&quot; of holding the Guidelines unconstitutional
is &quot;bedlam,&quot; and, while the lower &quot;courts are bound to favor
different recipes&quot; for sentencing, &quot;[t]he Supreme Court alone
can make a definitive judgment.&quot; App., infra, 14a (dissenting opinion).
Judge Easterbrook concluded that &quot;[t]oday's decision will discombobulate
the whole criminal-law docket. I trust that our superiors will have something
to say about this. Soon.&quot; Ibid.</P>

<P>The Second Circuit similarly implored the Court to act quickly to resolve
the questions presented in its opinion in Peneranda. The court of appeals
explained that Blakely &quot;raises the prospect that many thousands of
future sentences may be invalidated or, alternatively, that district courts
simply will halt sentencing altogether pending a definitive ruling by the
Supreme Court.&quot; Penaranda, 2004 WL 1551369, at *6. The court was &quot;convinced
that a prompt and authoritative answer to&quot; what it termed &quot;the
pall of uncertainty&quot; on federal sentencing &quot;is needed to avoid
a major disruption in the administration of criminal justice in the federal
courts-disruption that would be unfair to defendants, to crime victims,
to the public, and to the judges who must follow applicable constitutional
requirements.&quot; Ibid. The court noted that &quot;[m]any, if not all,
of the[] various attempts to implement Blakely ultimately may prove misguided-or
even wholly unnecessary.&quot; Id. at *7. But &quot;[i]n the meantime, *
* * defendants, victims, and the public will be left uncertain as to what
sentences are lawful.&quot; Ibid.</P>

<P>E. The Court Should Resolve The Questions Presented In This Case</P>

<P>The court of appeals squarely held that Blakely's Sixth Amendment holding
extends to the Guidelines, and this Court should promptly review that holding.
The question whether any unconstitutional aspects of the Guidelines scheme
are severable from the remainder is also properly raised in this petition.
The Court should grant review to address that issue as well, if Blakely
is held applicable to the Guidelines.</P>

<P>1. Although the court of appeals remanded for the district court to determine
how to proceed at sentencing, rather than resolving that issue itself, the
court of appeals' action does not detract from the appropriateness of granting
certiorari on that issue. The Court has jurisdiction to do so. A grant of
certiorari would bring before the Court the entire case, including the severability
question of how, if Blakely applies to the Guidelines, the sentencing court
is to proceed on remand. See 28 U.S.C. 2106 (&quot;The Supreme Court * *
* may affirm, modify, vacate, set aside or reverse any judgment, decree,
or order of a court lawfully brought before it for review, and may remand
the cause and * * * require such further proceedings to be had as may be
just under the circumstances.&quot;) (emphasis added). In instances in which
the Court has confronted questions of law that &quot;are currently in a
state of evolving definition and uncertainty,&quot; Newport v. Fact Concerts,
Inc., 453 U.S. 247, 256 (1981), it has reached the merits, despite procedural
obstacles, in order to settle an &quot;important&quot; issue that &quot;appears
likely to recur.&quot; Cf. id. at 257 (overlooking the plain error rule
where declining to review the issue on the merits &quot;would serve neither
to promote the interests of justice nor to advance efficient judicial administration&quot;).10
While the Court normally does not review an issue not presented or passed
on below, in exceptional cases, it will. See Carlson v. Green, 446 U.S.
14 (1980) (deciding question not pressed or passed on in the lower courts,
because it &quot;is an important, recurring issue and is properly raised
in another petition for certiorari being held pending disposition of this
case,&quot; and &quot;the interests of judicial administration will be served
by addressing the issue on its merits.&quot;).</P>

<P>In Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 396 (1989), in the context
of an earlier challenge to the Guidelines, this Court granted certiorari
on a severability question presented by the government that had not been
decided below. In that case, the district court had ruled that the Sentencing
Guidelines were constitutional, and it therefore did not reach any issue
of severability. Both the government and the defendant petitioned for certiorari
before judgment in Mistretta. The government's petition presented three
questions. Two of them addressed the constitutionality of the Guidelines-the
only question addressed by the district court. 87-1904 Pet. at i. The third
question, however, was &quot;[w]hether, if the sentencing guidelines are
invalid, the 1984 amendments to the statutes governing parole and 'good
time' credits are severable and therefore apply to defendants sentenced
for crimes committed after November 1, 1987.&quot; Ibid. The petition explained
that the issue was of great importance, that it had divided the district
courts, and that, if the Court struck down the Guidelines without resolving
the issue, &quot;the current confusion within the federal sentencing system
will continue until another case raising those issues reaches this Court.&quot;
Id. at 18. The defendant's petition also presented a severability question,
87-7028 Pet. at i, 7-9, noting that &quot;[i]n order to prevent mass confusion
and a flood of federal habeas corpus petitions * * *, this Court should
address the severability question in this proceeding.&quot; Id. at 9. The
Court granted certiorari on both petitions in full. 486 U.S. 1054 (1988).
The same logic dictates a grant of certiorari on the severability issue
in this case.</P>

<P>2. The government is also filing today a petition for a writ of certiorari
before judgment in United States v. Fanfan, No. 03-47-P-H (D. Me. June 28,
2004), appeal pending, No. 04-1946 (1st Cir. docketed July 19, 2004). In
Fanfan, the district court determined that the rule in Blakely is applicable
to the Guidelines, and it went on to hold that the court was therefore limited
to sentencing the defendant to a maximum term under the Guidelines based
solely on the facts found by the jury. Applying a Guidelines range of 63-78
months, rather than the range of 188-235 months that it found that the Guidelines
otherwise required, the court sentenced the defendant to a term of 78 months
of imprisonment. Fanfan thus resolved both questions presented in the petition
in this case, and it provides an appropriate companion vehicle for this
Court to consider, in a concrete context, the implications of Blakely for
federal sentencing. The government suggests that the Court grant the petitions
both in this case and in Fanfan to assure that the Court has a vehicle in
which to reach and resolve the vitally important issues presented. Simultaneous
grants of review here and in Fanfan would protect against any possibility
that later impediments to review in one or the other case might prevent
timely resolution of the issues.</P>

<P>3. The en banc Second Circuit has certified three questions to this Court
under 28 U.S.C. 1254(2), urging the Court to decide &quot;the threshold
issue of whether Blakely applies to the federal Sentencing Guidelines.&quot;
United States v. Penaranda, 2004 WL 1551369, at *7. While the government
agrees with the Second Circuit on the need for expedited resolution of that
issue, Penaranda provides a less suitable vehicle for resolving the issues
than this case and Fanfan. First, each of the Second Circuit's certified
questions is a variation on the same theme: whether Blakely applies to the
Guidelines. Unlike the petition in this case, the Second Circuit's certification
order does not encompass any question concerning the consequences of holding
Blakely applicable to the Guidelines. That is not because the Second Circuit
regards that issue as unimportant. The court of appeals clearly recognized
that &quot;once a court concludes that Blakely applies to the Guidelines,
it is without guidance as to the means for achieving compliance,&quot; Penaranda,
id. at *7, and graphically illustrated the vital need for resolution of
that issue by cataloguing five different approaches taken by district courts
and noting the uncertainty that will prevail &quot;while these judicial
approaches are being litigated.&quot; Ibid. But the Second Circuit's certified
questions would not permit the Court to reach and resolve those remedial
issues. In contrast, the petition for certiorari here squarely raises that
issue.</P>

<P>Second, both of the two defendants involved in the Penaranda certification
(Penaranda and Rojas) raised other issues on appeal.11 If Penaranda is successful
in obtaining a new trial, his sentencing challenges would become moot, at
least pending conviction at a retrial. The same might not be true for Rojas,
who challenges only the procedures at sentencing, but an advantage of the
petition in this case is that the court of appeals has rejected all other
challenges raised by the defendant aside from the Blakely challenge. App.,
infra, 22a.</P>

<P>Finally, in this case the Court has the benefit of a concrete judgment
examining the applicability of Blakely; in Penaranda, no court has rendered
a decision resolving the Blakely issues. This case also has the benefit
of questions presented that were formulated by the petitioning party, in
accordance with the customary practice of this Court. The adversary system
contemplates that the parties will normally frame the questions for courts
to review. While Congress has retained certification by a court of appeals
as a mode of Supreme Court review, it has rarely been employed in recent
years. See Robert L. Stern, et al., Supreme Court Practice &sect;&sect;
9.1, 9.3 (8th ed. 2002). Adherence to the normal adversary mode of review
has the advantage of settled and well-understood procedures.12</P>

<P>F. Expedited Review Is Warranted</P>

<P>In light of the urgent need for this Court's resolution of the questions
presented and the thousands-or even tens of thousands-of criminal sentencings
that will be thrown into doubt until such resolution can be achieved, this
Court should expedite consideration of the petition and, if review is granted,
the case on the merits. The need for expedition is so great that this Court
should consider setting a timetable that permits argument to be held before
the Court's scheduled argument sessions in the October 2004 Term. The government
today is filing a motion for expedited consideration, proposing schedules
for the Court's hearing of this case and United States v. Fanfan. The motion
proposes a schedule under which the Court would order responses to the petitions
to be filed in time for this Court to decide whether to grant certiorari
by August 2. If certiorari is granted on that date, the government proposes
a schedule that would give each side two weeks for its principal brief on
the merits (the government's briefs would be due on August 16, respondents'
briefs due on August 30). The government's reply briefs would be due on
September 8, and the Court could then hear oral argument September 13. That
schedule would permit the Court to return a degree of stability to the federal
sentencing system at the earliest possible date. An alternative schedule
would allow for argument on the first scheduled day of the October 2004
Term, with corresponding adjustments to the briefing schedule.</P>

<P>JULY 2004</P>

<P>1 At oral argument, the government urged that, if a court finds that
sentencing under the Guidelines must comport with Blakely and that there
are enhancements under the Guidelines that are not established by the jury
verdict or admitted by the defendant, the Guidelines as a whole cannot be
applied and the court should impose a sentence, as a matter of its discretion,
within the minimum and maximum statutory terms, giving due regard to Guidelines.
An audio recording of the argument is available at &lt;http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/farg/arg.fwx?caseno=03-4225&gt;.
The government's unofficial transcript of the relevant excerpts of the argument,
made from the recording, is reproduced at App., infra, 28a-30a.</P>

<P>2 In an amendment to its order filed on July 13, 2004, the court added
that &quot;[b]ecause the government does not argue that [respondent's] Sixth
Amendment challenge to the guidelines was forfeited by not being made in
the district court, we need not consider the application of the doctrine
of plain error.&quot; App., infra, 26a-27a.</P>

<P>3 See, e.g., United States v. Casas, 356 F.3d 104, 128 (1st Cir.), cert.
denied, 124 S. Ct. 2405 (2004); United States v. Luciano, 311 F.3d 146,

Pettigrew, 346 F.3d 1139, 1147 n.18 (D.C. Cir. 2003).</P>

<P>4 A number of district courts have reached the same conclusion. In United
States v. Croxford, 2004 WL 1521560 (D. Utah July 7, 2004), for example,
the court held that &quot;the inescapable conclusion of Blakely is that
the federal sentencing guidelines have been rendered unconstitutional in
cases such as this one,&quot; id. at *6, in which &quot;the Guidelines require
an upward enhancement of the defendant's sentencing range without a jury
determination,&quot; id. at *9. See e.g., United States v. Shamblin, 2004
WL 1468561, at *8 (S.D. W.Va. June 30, 2004). District courts in a number
of other still-unreported cases have also held that the Blakely rule applies
to the Sentencing Guidelines. See, e.g., United States v. Leach, No. 02-172-14
(E.D. Pa. July 13, 2004); United States v. Fanfan, No. 03-47-P-H (D. Me.
June 28, 2004), appeal pending, No. 04-1946 (1st Cir. docketed July 19,
2004), petition for cert. pending (filed July 21, 2004); United States v.
Toro, 2004 WL 1575325 (D. Conn. July 8, 2004); United States v. Montgomery,
2004 WL 1535646 (D. Utah July 8, 2004); United States v. Watson, Cr. No.
03-0146 (D.D.C. June 30, 2004).</P>

<P>5 A number of district courts have agreed that Blakely does not extend
to the Sentencing Guidelines. See, e.g., United States v. Olivera-Hernandez,
No. 2:04CR0013 (D. Utah July 12, 2004); United States v. Lazcano-Flores,
No. 04-45 (S.D. Iowa July 8, 2004); United States v. Childs, No. 03-2056
(N.D. Iowa July 8, 2004).</P>

<P>6 The need for prompt resolution of the questions presented is further
highlighted by the fact that two other courts of appeals have already granted
en banc review of the application of Blakely to the Guidelines. A few days
after the decision in this case, a panel of the Sixth Circuit concluded
that, in light of Blakely, the federal sentencing scheme violates the Sixth
Amendment in a broad swath of federal criminal cases. United States v. Montgomery,
2004 WL 1562904, at *2 (6th Cir. July 14, 2004). The Sixth Circuit then
sua sponte granted rehearing en banc on the issue and vacated the panel's
decision. See United States v. Montgomery, No. 03-5256 (6th Cir. July 19,
2004). The Fourth Circuit has also granted en banc consideration of the
issue. United States v. Hammoud, No. 03-4253 (4th Cir. June 30, 2004) (argument
scheduled for August 2, 2004).</P>

<P>7 Other district courts have reached the same conclusion. See, e.g.,
United States v. Einstman, 2004 WL 1576622 (S.D.N.Y. July 14, 2004) (pre-sentencing
memorandum and order); United States v. Lamoreaux, 2004 WL 1557283 (W.D.
Mo. July 7, 2004).</P>

<P>8 Other district courts have reached the same conclusion. See, e.g.,
United States v. Fanfan, supra (reducing sentencing range from 188-235 months
to 63-78 months of imprisonment); Leach, supra (reducing sentencing range
from 360 months to life imprisonment to 210-262 months of imprisonment);
Watson, supra (reducing sentence from 72 months to 16 months of imprisonment
and immediately releasing the defendant); Toro, supra (reducing sentence
from 24 months to 6 months of imprisonment).</P>

<P>9 On July 13, 2004, District Judge Cassell testified before the Senate
Committee on the Judiciary that, in one district, Blakely has led to &quot;delayed
guilty pleas,&quot; &quot;extended plea colloquies,&quot; and &quot;added
time and effort spent on cases which would have resulted in a plea but now
require trial&quot; and, in another, &quot;pleas and sentencings have almost
come to a halt.&quot; Blakely v. Washington and the Future of the Sentencing
Guidelines: Hearing Before the Senate Judiciary Comm., 106th Cong., 2d Sess.
at *8-*10 (2004) (statement of Hon. Paul Cassell, Judge, United States District
Court Judge for the District of Utah), available in &lt;http://judiciary.
senate.gov/print_testimony.cfm?id=1260&amp;wit_id=3669&gt;.</P>

<P>10 See Virginia Bankshares, Inc. v. Sandberg, 501 U.S. 1083, 1099 n.8
(1991) (reaching issue decided, though not pressed, below because of the
&quot;uncertainty&quot; surrounding the issue and its &quot;importance to
the administration of federal law&quot;); see also Kolstad v. American Dental
Ass'n, 527 U.S. 526, 540-541 (1999) (resolving legal standards governing
principal's liability for punitive damages for actions of its agents under
Title VII, although the court below did not reach that issue).</P>

<P>11 In United States v. Rojas, No. 03-1062(L), the defendant has raised
the issue &quot;[w]hether Mr. Rojas' Sixth Amendment rights were violated
by the government's suppression of evidence at the Fatico [sentencing] hearing.&quot;
Br. 2, 17-22 (filed Dec. 9, 2003). In United States v. Penaranda, No. 03-1284(L),
the defendant raises three issues challenging the fairness of his trial
and seeking a new trial. Br. 4-5, 60 (filed Sept. 18, 2003). The Second
Circuit did not grant en banc review on those issues, but instead left them
for resolution &quot;in the normal course by the panels to which the cases
are assigned.&quot; Penaranda, at *1 n.1; see id. at *8 n.10 (noting that
court's transmission of the records to this court was &quot;not to suggest
that the Court should decide the entirety of the matters in controversy&quot;).</P>

<P>12 After deciding this case and Fanfan, the Court could dispose of Penaranda
as appropriate. Cf. Iran Nat'l Airlines Corp. v. Marschalk Co., 453 U.S.
919 (1981) (disposing of certified questions in light of Court's decision
on merits in case raising similar issue).</P>

&sect; 841(b)(1)(A)(iii). At sentencing, the judge found by a preponderance
of the evidence that the defendant (1) had distributed 566 grams over and
above the 92.5 grams that the jury had to have found (for the defendant
did not contest that it was the amount of crack in his duffel bag-he just
claimed he hadn't put it there) and (2) had obstructed justice. Under the
federal sentencing guidelines, the additional quantity finding increased
the defendant's base offense level from 32 to 36, U.S.S.G. &sect;&sect;
2D1.1(c)(2), (4). The effect, together with that of the enhancement that
the guidelines prescribe for obstruction of justice, U.S.S.G. &sect; 3C1.1,
was to place the defendant in a sentencing range of 360 months to life.
The judge sentenced him to the bottom of the range. The appeal challenges
the sentence on the ground that the sentencing guidelines violate the Sixth
Amendment insofar as they permit the judge to find facts (other than facts
relating to a defendant's criminal history) that determine the defendant's
sentencing range. There is also a challenge to the conviction, based on
the judge's limiting the scope of cross-examination, but so obviously harmless
was that error (if it was an error) that we will move immediately to the
sentencing issue.</P>

<P>We have expedited our decision in an effort to provide some guidance
to the district judges (and our own court's staff), who are faced with an
avalanche of motions for resentencing in the light of Blakely v. Washington,
- U.S. -, 124 S. Ct. 2531, - L. Ed. 2d -, 2004 WL 1402697 (U.S. June 24,
2004), which has cast a long shadow over the federal sentencing guidelines.
We cannot of course provide definitive guidance; only the Court and Congress
can do that; our hope is that an early opinion will help speed the issue
to a definitive resolution.</P>

<P>Blakely invalidates under the Sixth Amendment (which had of course long
been held applicable to state criminal proceedings by an interpretation
of the Fourteenth Amendment) a statute of the State of Washington that authorized
the sentencing judge to impose a sentence above the &quot;standard range&quot;
set forth in the statute punishing the offense if he found any aggravating
factors that justified such a departure; pursuant to this grant of authority,
the judge had imposed a sentence of 90 months on the defendant, which exceeded
the standard range of 49 to 53 months for his offense, second-degree kidnapping.</P>

<P>The Supreme Court had already held that &quot;other than the fact of
a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond
the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved
beyond a reasonable doubt.&quot; Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 490,
120 S. Ct. 2348, 147 L. Ed. 2d 435 (2000). In Blakely it let the other shoe
drop and held over pointed dissents that &quot;the 'statutory maximum' for
Apprendi purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose solely on the
basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.&quot;
Blakely v. Washington, supra, at *4. &quot;In other words, the relevant
'statutory maximum' is not the maximum sentence a judge may impose after
finding additional facts, but the maximum he may impose without any additional
findings. When a judge inflicts punishment that the jury's verdict alone
does not allow, the jury has not found all the facts 'which the law makes
essential to the punishment,' and the judge exceeds his proper authority.&quot;
Id. (citation omitted). &quot;[W]ithout&quot; is italicized in the original;
we have italicized &quot;relevant&quot; to underscore the difference between
the maximum sentence in the statute, and the maximum sentence-what the Supreme
Court regards as the &quot;relevant statutory maximum&quot;-that the judge
can impose without making his own findings, above and beyond what the jury
found or the defendant admitted or, as here, did not contest.</P>

<P>The maximum sentence that the district judge could have imposed in this
case (without an upward departure), had he not made any findings concerning
quantity of drugs or obstruction of justice, would have been 262 months,
given the defendant's base offense level of 32 U.S.S.G. &sect; 2D1.1(c)(4)
(32 is the base offense level when the defendant possessed at least 50 grams
but less than 150 grams of crack), and the defendant's criminal history.
U.S.S.G. &sect;&sect; 4A1.1(a)-(e), 2(c)(1). True, that maximum is imposed
not by the words of a federal statute, but by the sentencing guidelines.
Provisions of the guidelines establish a &quot;standard range&quot; for
possessing with intent to distribute at least 50 grams of cocaine base,
and other provisions of the guidelines establish aggravating factors that
if found by the judge jack up the range. The pattern is the same as that
in the Washington statute, and it is hard to believe that the fact that
the guidelines are promulgated by the U.S. Sentencing Commission rather
than by a legislature can make a difference. The Commission is exercising
power delegated to it by Congress, and if a legislature cannot evade what
the Supreme Court deems the commands of the Constitution by a multistage
sentencing scheme neither, it seems plain, can a regulatory agency. In its
decision upholding the guidelines against delegation and separation of powers
challenges, the Supreme Court had stated that &quot;although Congress granted
the Commission substantial discretion in formulating the guidelines, in
actuality it legislated a full hierarchy of punishment-from near maximum
imprisonment, to substantial imprisonment, to some imprisonment, to alternatives-and
stipulated the most important offense and offender characteristics to place
defendants within these categories&quot; and that &quot;in contrast to a
court's exercising judicial power, the Commission is fully accountable to
Congress, which can revoke or amend any or all of the Guidelines as it sees
fit either within the 180-day waiting period or at any time.&quot; Mistretta
v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 377, 393-94, 109 S. Ct. 647, 102 L. Ed.
2d 714 (1989) (citation omitted).</P>

<P>It would seem to follow, therefore, as the four dissenting Justices in
Blakely warned, Blakely v. Washington, supra, at *16-17 (O'Connor, J., dissenting);
id. at *29 (Breyer, J., dissenting); and several district judges have already
ruled, e.g., United States v. Croxford, 2004 WL 1521560, at *7, *13 (D.
Utah July, 7, 2004); United States v. Medas, 2004 WL 1498183, at *1 (E.D.N.Y.
July 1, 2004); United States v. Shamblin, 2004 WL 1468561, at *8 (S.D. W.
Va. June 30, 2004), that Blakely dooms the guidelines insofar as they require
that sentences be based on facts found by a judge. The majority in Blakely,
faced with dissenting opinions that as much as said that the decision doomed
the federal sentencing guidelines, might have said, no it doesn't; it did
not say that.</P>

<P>The qualification &quot;based on facts found by a judge&quot; is critical.
Nothing in Blakely suggests that Congress cannot delegate to the Sentencing
Commission the authority to decree that possession with intent to distribute
658.5 grams of cocaine base shall be punished by a sentence of at least
360 months though the statutory minimum is only 10 years. All it cannot
do under Blakely is take away from the defendant the right to demand that
the quantity be determined by the jury rather than by the judge, and on
the basis of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The government argues that
all the guidelines do is regularize the discretion that judges would exercise
in picking a sentence within a statutory range. Mistretta v. United States,
supra, 488 U.S. at 395. If that were indeed all, that would be fine. And
indeed to a great extent the system of the guidelines, with its sentencing
ranges and upward and downward departures, limits rather than extinguishes
sentencing discretion. But the issue in Blakely was not sentencing discretion-it
was the authority of the sentencing judge to find the facts that determine
how that discretion shall be implemented and to do so on the basis of only
the civil burden of proof. The vices of the guidelines are thus that they
require the sentencing judge to make findings of fact (and to do so under
the wrong standard of proof), e.g., 18 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 3553(a)(4), (5);
1B1.1, 3(a), 6A1.3(b); Edwards v. United States, 523 U.S. 511, 513-14, 118
S. Ct. 1475, 140 L. Ed. 2d 703 (1998); United States v. Bequette, 309 F.3d
448, 450-51 (7th Cir. 2002); United States v. Jackson, 300 F.3d 740, 749
(7th Cir. 2002); United States v. Guzman, 318 F.3d 1191, 1197-98 (10th Cir.
2003); United States v. Lopez, 219 F.3d 343, 348 (4th Cir. 2000), and that
the judge's findings largely determine the sentence, given the limits on
upward and downward departures, 18 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 3553(b), (e), (f);
U.S.S.G. &sect; 5K2.0; Koon v. United States, 518 U.S. 81, 92, 96, 116 S.
Ct. 2035, 135 L. Ed. 2d 392 (1996); United States v. Sherman, 53 F.3d 782,
788-89 (7th Cir. 1995); United States v. Lafayette, 337 F.3d 1043, 1052
D.C. Cir. 2003); cf. United States v. Cruz, 317 F.3d 763, 766 (7th Cir.
2003). The finding of facts (other than the fact of the defendant's criminal
history) bearing on the length of the sentence is just what the Supreme
Court in Blakely has determined to be the province of the jury.</P>

<P>Of course, under almost any sentencing regime some residual discretion
is vested in the sentencing judge; and to the extent that his exercise of
discretion is influenced by the facts of the case, if only the facts that
he may have gleaned concerning the defendant's character, remorse, health,
and so on, judicial factfinding enters the sentencing process. But there
is a difference between allowing a sentencing judge to consider a range
of factors that may include facts that he informally finds-the pre-guidelines
regime, under which &quot;once it [was] determined that a sentence [was]
within the limitations set forth in the statute under which it [was] imposed,
appellate review [was] at an end,&quot; Dorszynski v. United States, 418
U.S. 424, 431, 94 S. Ct. 3042, 41 L. Ed. 2d 855 (1974), though sentences
would occasionally be reversed because the district judge had relied on
an impermissible consideration, e.g., United States v. Maples, 501 F.2d
985 (4th Cir. 1974), failed to exercise discretion, or based the sentence
on false information, e.g., Townsend v. Burke, 334 U.S. 736, 741, 68 S.
Ct. 1252, 92 L. Ed. 1690 (1948)-and commanding him to make factfindings
and base the sentence (within a narrow band) on them. The latter is what
Washington's sentencing guidelines did, and there is no basis for thinking
that Blakely would have been decided differently had the identical guidelines
been promulgated, with the identical effect on sentences, by the Washington
Sentencing Commission. The Court in Blakely was well aware of the difference,
stating that factfinding by judges and parole boards under indeterminate
sentencing regimes are permissible because &quot;the facts do not pertain
to whether the defendant has a legal right to a lesser sentence-and that
makes all the difference insofar as judicial impingement upon the traditional
role of the jury is concerned.&quot; Blakely v. Washington, supra, at *7
(emphasis in original).</P>

<P>It is tempting to think that maybe the guidelines can be saved by imagining
the Sentencing Commission as a kind of superjudge who elaborates a code
of sentencing principles much as a thoughtful real judge, operating in a
regime of indeterminate sentencing, might do informally in an effort to
try to make his sentences consistent. But the same reasoning would if accepted
have saved Washington's sentencing guidelines, unless an administrative
agency is to be deemed a more responsible, a more authoritative, fount of
criminal law than a legislature. The four dissenting Justices in Blakely
were unable to identify a meaningful difference between the Washington sentencing
guidelines and the federal sentencing guidelines. A fifth Justice-Justice
Scalia, the author of the majority opinion in Blakely- had dissented in
Mistretta on the ground that the federal sentencing guidelines were indeed
laws, not judicial pronouncements. Mistretta v. United States, supra, 488
U.S. at 413-27. And Justice Scalia, now speaking for a majority of the Court,
in Blakely, though he replied to the dissenting Justices at length, did
not say that they were wrong to suggest that the federal sentencing guidelines
could not be distinguished from the Washington sentencing guidelines. Instead
he said: &quot;By reversing the judgment below, we are not, as the State
would have it, 'find [ing] determinate sentencing schemes unconstitutional.'
This case is not about whether determinate sentencing is constitutional,
only about how it can be implemented in a way that respects the Sixth Amendment.&quot;
Blakely v. Washington, supra, at *7. No distinction between the Washington
statute and other schemes of determinate sentencing, such as the federal
sentencing guidelines on which the dissenting Justices had dwelled at such
length, is suggested.</P>

<P>As an original matter, then, we think that the guidelines, though only
in cases such as the present one in which they limit defendants' right to
a jury and to the reasonable-doubt standard, and thus the right of defendant
Booker to have a jury determine (using that standard) how much cocaine base
he possessed and whether he obstructed justice, violate the Sixth Amendment
as interpreted by Blakely. We cannot be certain of this. But we cannot avoid
the duty to decide an issue squarely presented to us. If our decision is
wrong, may the Supreme Court speedily reverse it.</P>

<P>We are mindful of the Supreme Court's ukase that the lower federal courts
are not to overrule a Supreme Court decision even if it seems manifestly
inconsistent with a subsequent decision, unless the subsequent decision
explicitly overruled the earlier one. State Oil Co. v. Khan, 522 U.S. 3,
20, 118 S. Ct. 275, 139 L. Ed. 2d 199 (1997). The government argues that
the guidelines were upheld against a Sixth Amendment challenge in Edwards
v. United States, supra, 523 U.S. at 515, and if this is right we shall
have to affirm Booker's sentence whatever our independent view of the guidelines'
consistency with Blakely. (The government also mentions United States v.
Watts, 519 U.S. 148, 117 S. Ct. 633, 136 L. Ed. 2d 554 (1997) (per curiam),
a double-jeopardy case, and other Supreme Court decisions that rebuff various
constitutional challenges to the guidelines-but not a Sixth Amendment challenge.
Pre-Blakely decisions by lower federal courts rebuffing a Sixth Amendment
challenge are of course no longer authoritative.) We do not think it is
right. None of the opinions in Blakely cites Edwards. The majority opinion
in Blakely states that &quot;the Federal Guidelines are not before us, and
we express no opinion on them,&quot; Blakely v. Washington, supra, at *6
n.9; it does not state that they were upheld against a Sixth Amendment challenge
in Edwards or any other case. (They were not, as we'll see.) When the Supreme
Court says that it is not resolving an issue, it perforce confides the issue
to the lower federal courts for the first pass at resolution.</P>

<P>The Court could have said in footnote 9 that the question whether to
overrule Edwards was not before it. It did not say that. That is not surprising.
The opinion in Edwards does not mention the Sixth Amendment or the constitutional
right to a jury trial, and indeed states that &quot;we need not, and we
do not, consider the merits of petitioners' statutory and constitutional
claims.&quot; 523 U.S. at 516. The Court did say that &quot;petitioners'
statutory and constitutional claims would make a difference if it were possible
to argue, say, that the sentences imposed exceeded the maximum that the
statutes permit for cocaine,&quot; id. at 515, which may mean that their
constitutional claims (a mishmash of claims under different provisions of
the Constitution, including however the Sixth Amendment) did not matter
because the sentences did not exceed the statutory maximum. This was of
course the understanding before Blakely, but Blakely redefined &quot;statutory
maximum.&quot; An assumption is not a holding.</P>

<P>The Court in Edwards was affirming a decision by this court, reported
at 105 F.3d 1179 (7th Cir. 1997), which does not mention the Sixth Amendment
or the constitutional right to a jury trial or any other constitutional
issue. That would hardly have been oversight on the part of the opinion's
author. The Supreme Court said that it was granting certiorari in Edwards
to resolve a conflict over the question whether &quot;the Sentencing Guidelines
require the sentencing judge, not the jury, to determine both the kind and
the amount of the drugs at issue in a drug conspiracy.&quot; 523 U.S. at
513. None of the other cases it cited for the existence of the conflict
mentions the Constitution either. United States v. Bounds, 985 F.2d 188,
194-95 (5th Cir. 1993); United States v. Pace, 981 F.2d 1123, 1128-30 (10th
Cir. 1992); United States v. Owens, 904 F.2d 411 (8th Cir. 1990).</P>

<P>And, finally, the petitioners in Edwards did not argue that the sentencing
guidelines are unconstitutional. They did not say that the guidelines establish
a sentencing structure that violates the Sixth Amendment. The most that
can be dug out of their briefs, so far as bears on that issue, is that they
were urging a statutory interpretation that would avoid a Sixth Amendment
issue. The Court did not opine on the guidelines' consistency with the amendment
because that consistency was not challenged. It did not rebuff a Sixth Amendment
challenge to the guidelines because there was no Sixth Amendment challenge
to the guidelines. We are obligated therefore to make our own constitutional
determination.</P>

<P>We conclude that Booker has a right to have the jury determine the quantity
of drugs he possessed and the facts underlying the determination that he
obstructed justice. The judgment must therefore be reversed and the case
remanded for resentencing. If the government does not object, the judge
can simply sentence Booker to 262 months, since the choice of that sentence
would not require any judicial factfinding. But if the government wants
a higher sentence or unless, as explained below, the guidelines are not
severable, then Booker, unless he strikes a deal with the government, will
be entitled to a sentencing hearing at which a jury will have to find by
proof beyond a reasonable doubt the facts on which a higher sentence would
be premised. There is no novelty in a separate jury trial with regard to
the sentence, just as there is no novelty in a bifurcated jury trial, in
which the jury first determines liability and then, if and only if it finds
liability, determines damages. Separate hearings before a jury on the issue
of sentence is the norm in capital cases.</P>

<P>Of course this will not work if the facts that the government would seek
to establish in the sentencing hearing are elements of a statutory offense,
for they would then have to be alleged in the indictment, and to re-indict
at this stage would present a double-jeopardy issue. We can hardly attempt
to resolve such issues on this appeal; the parties have not briefed or argued
them. It would be doubly premature to address them, in light of the recent
announcement by the Department of Justice that it believes that if Blakely
is applicable to the guidelines, the &quot;entire system&quot; of the guidelines
&quot;must fall.&quot; &quot;Departmental Legal Positions and Policies in
Light of Blakely v. Washington,&quot; Memorandum to All Federal Prosecutors
from James Comey, Deputy Attorney General of the United States, p. 3 (July
2, 2004). The Department may be right; the aspect of the guidelines that
we believe to be unconstitutional, namely the requirement that the sentencing
judge make certain findings that shall operate as the premise of the sentence
and that he make them on the basis of the preponderance of the evidence,
may not be severable from the substantive provisions of the guidelines.
That is a question of legislative intent. Minnesota v. Mille Lacs Band of
Chippewa Indians, 526 U.S. 172, 191, 119 S. Ct. 1187, 143 L. Ed. 2d 270
(1999). The practical effect just of upping the burden of persuasion in
sentencing hearings will be to reduce the average sentence, and Congress
might prefer a return to indeterminate sentencing (within the statutory
ranges). In that event the guidelines would be invalid in their entirety,
except, of course, as information that some judges would continue to give
great weight to. But severability is another issue that has not been briefed
or argued to us.</P>

<P>It might seem that if the substantive portions of the guidelines are
not severable from the requirement that the judge find the facts relevant
to the sentence, a 262-month sentence would be illegal. We do not think
so. If the guidelines fall, the judge is free as he was before the guidelines
were promulgated to fix any sentence within the statutory range, and the
range for Booker, remember, is 10 years to life. Since the fall of the guidelines
is a quite possible outcome, it would be prudent for the judge in any event
to select a fall-back sentence.</P>

<P>To summarize: (1) The application of the guidelines in this case violated
the Sixth Amendment as interpreted in Blakely; (2) in cases where there
are no enhancements-that is, no factual findings by the judge increasing
the sentence-there is no constitutional violation in applying the guidelines
unless the guidelines are invalid in their entirety; (3) we do not decide
the severability of the guidelines, and so that is an issue for consideration
on remand should it be made an issue by the parties; (4) if the guidelines
are severable, the judge can use a sentencing jury; if not, he can choose
any sentence between 10 years and life and in making the latter determination
he is free to draw on the guidelines for recommendations as he sees fit;
(5) as a matter of prudence, the judge should in any event select a nonguidelines
alternative sentence.</P>

<P>REVERSED AND REMANDED.</P>

<P>EASTERBROOK, Circuit Judge, dissenting.</P>

<P>My colleagues hold that, after Blakely v. Washington, No. 02-1632 (U.S.
June 24, 2004), judicial application of the Sentencing Guidelines violates
the defendant's right to trial by jury under the sixth amendment. I disagree
with that holding on both procedural and substantive grounds. This is the
wrong forum for such a conclusion; and whatever power we may possess should
not be exercised to set at naught a central component of federal criminal
practice.</P>

<P>Procedure first. The Supreme Court alone is entitled to declare one of
its decisions defunct. Even if later decisions wash away the earlier one's
foundation, still the power to administer the coup de gr&acirc;ce belongs
to our superiors. See, e.g., State Oil Co. v. Khan, 522 U.S. 3, 20, 118
S. Ct. 275, 139 L. Ed. 2d 199 (1997); Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American
Experss, Inc., 490 U.S. 477, 484, 109 S. Ct. 1917, 104 L. Ed. 2d 526 (1989).
The alternative is bedlam-which is the likely consequence of today's decision.
A court of appeals cannot replace the Guidelines with something else; the
list of non-exclusive options at the end of the majority's opinion is our
home-brewed formula, and other courts are bound to favor different recipes
as 900 district and circuit judges fumble for solutions. The Supreme Court
alone can make a definitive judgment.</P>

<P>In order to reach the result they do, my colleagues must conclude that
Edwards v. United States, 523 U.S. 511, 118 S. Ct. 1475, 140 L. Ed. 2d 703
(1998), was wrongly decided. Our portfolio as intermediate judges in a hierarchical
system does not include the authority to make such declarations. True enough,
Edwards does not contain the phrase &quot;sixth amendment.&quot; But an
argument based on the sixth amendment was made to the Court: defendants
insisted that, if the Guidelines and statutes were read as the United States
and the Justices themselves did, that would deprive them of their right
to a jury trial. The Court's opinion in Edwards acknowledged that constitutional
contentions had been advanced. Edwards held that a judge nonetheless may
ascertain (using the preponderance standard) the type and amount of drugs
involved, and impose a sentence based on that conclusion, as long as the
sentence does not exceed the statutory maximum. According to my colleagues:
&quot;This was of course the understanding before Blakely, but Blakely redefined
'statutory maximum.&quot;' Slip op. 8. Maybe so, but if so it is just a
reason why Edwards is on its last legs. It does not imply that we are entitled
to put it in a coffin while it is still breathing.</P>

<P>Just as opera stars often go on singing after being shot, stabbed, or
poisoned, so judicial opinions often survive what could be fatal blows.
Think of Lemon v. Kurtzman, 411 U.S. 192, 93 S. Ct. 1463, 36 L. Ed. 2d 151
(1973), which is incompatible with later decisions, has been disparaged
by most sitting Justices, yet has not been overruled. Closer to the mark
is Almendarex-Torres v. United States, 523 U.S. 224, 118 S. Ct. 1219, 140
L. Ed. 2d 350 (1998), decided one month before Edwards and, like it, in
tension with Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 120 S. Ct. 2348, 147
L. Ed. 2d 435 (2000), on which Blakely rests. Almendarez-Torres holds that
juries need not be asked to determine a defendant's criminal history even
for purposes of recidivist statutes that use convictions to increase the
maximum sentence. Four Justices, dissenting in Almendarez-Torres, made the
arguments that were to carry the day two years later in Apprendi, when they
were joined by Justice Thomas, who had been in the Almendarez-Torres majority.
See 523 U.S. at 248-71 (Scalia, J., joined by Stevens, Souter &amp; Ginsburg,
JJ ., dissenting). Justice Thomas wrote that he now considers Almendarez-Torres
wrongly decided. Apprendi, 530 U.S. at 518-21 (Thomas, J., concurring).
One might think Almendarez-Torres doomed, but it has not been overruled,
and Blakely repeats a formula that carves out recidivist enhancements. We
routinely apply Almendarez-Torres, saying that its fate rests with the Supreme
Court alone. Edwards should receive the same treatment.</P>

<P>To support the view that Edwards no longer is authoritative, the majority
notes that none of the opinions in Blakely cited it. Why would it pass without
mention if it is a (logical) casualty of Blakely? Well, one reason could
be that Edwards is not a logical casualty; that's the substantive question
I discuss later. The other is that the question was left undecided. Blakely
tells us: &quot;The United States, as amicus curiae, urges us to affirm.
It notes differences between Washington's sentencing regime and the Federal
Sentencing Guidelines but questions whether those differences are constitutionally
significant. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 25-30. The Federal
Guidelines are not before us, and we express no opinion on them.&quot; Slip
op. 9 n.9. Having disclaimed views about the Guidelines, the Justices had
no occasion to parse Edwards. I find it odd that my colleagues should focus
on what the Court did not do (cite Edwards ) while slighting what it did
do (declare that analysis of the federal Guidelines is a different kettle
of fish). What's more, although the Court did not attend to Edwards in Blakely,
it did so in Apprendi itself, writing:</P>

<P>The principal dissent . . . treats us to a lengthy disquisition on the
benefits of determinate sentencing schemes, and the effect of today's decision
on the federal Sentencing Guidelines. Post, at 544-552. The Guidelines are,
of course, not before the Court. We therefore express no view on the subject
beyond what this Court has already held. See, e.g., Edwards v. United States,
523 U.S. 511, 515, 118 S. Ct. 1475, 140 L. Ed. 2d 703 (1998) (opinion of
Breyer, J., for a unanimous court) (noting that &quot;[o]f course, petitioners'
statutory and constitutional claims would make a difference if it were possible
to argue, say, that the sentences imposed exceeded the maximum that the
statutes permit for a cocaine-only conspiracy. That is because a maximum
sentence set by statute trumps a higher sentence set forth in the Guidelines.
[United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual &sect; 5G1.1 (Nov.1994)
]&quot;).</P>

<P>530 U.S. at 497 at 497 n.21. So the Justices see the links connecting
the sixth amendment, Apprendi, Edwards, statutory maximums, and the federal
Sentencing Guidelines. It is for them, not us, to say that as a result of
Blakely this linkage scuttles Edwards. (Other casualties of the majority's
approach are United States v. Watts, 519 U.S. 148, 117 S. Ct. 633, 136 L.
Ed. 2d 554 (1997), which holds that a judge may increase a sentence based
on relevant conduct of which the defendant had been acquitted by the jury,
and United States v. Dunnigan, 507 U.S. 87, 113 S. Ct. 1111, 122 L. Ed.
2d 445 (1993), which holds that to decide whether the defendant receives
a higher sentence for obstructing justice the judge may (indeed must) decide
independently of the jury whether the defendant committed perjury at trial.
See also McMilllan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U.S. 79, 106 S. Ct. 2411, 91 L.
Ed. 2d 67 (1986), which Blakely distinguished, but which on my colleagues'
view is a dead letter.)</P>

<P>Now to substance. Apprendi establishes, 530 U.S. at 490 and Blakely reiterates,
slip op. 5, this rule: &quot;Other than the fact of a prior conviction,
any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory
maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.&quot;
Shortly after Apprendi was released, we held that the &quot;statutory maximum&quot;
means whatever statutory criteria make a person eligible for a given punishment.
Consider 21 U.S.C. &sect; 841, which establishes three maximums for cocaine-distribution
offenses: distribution of any quantity permits a sentence up to 20 years
(&sect; 841(b)(1)(C); distribution of more than 500 grams (or 5 grams of
cocaine base) raises the maximum to 40 years (&sect; 841(b)(1)(B)(i), (iii),
distribution of more than 5 kilograms (or 50 grams of cocaine base) raises
the statutory maximum to life (&sect; 841(b)(1)(A)(i), (iii). In United
States v. Nance, 236 F.3d 820, 824-25 (7th Cir. 2000), we held that the
thresholds (500 grams and 5 kilograms) must be charged in the indictment
and established beyond a reasonable doubt to the jury's satisfaction (if
the defendant does not waive jury trial or admit the quantities). Otherwise
the maximum is 20 years. Once the trier of fact has determined that the
defendant distributed at least 500 grams or 5 kilograms, the sixth amendment
has been satisfied and choosing a sentence below the statutory limit is
for the judge alone, on the preponderance of the evidence. See, e.g., Talbott
v. Indiana, 226 F.3d 866, 869-70 (7th Cir. 2000).</P>

<P>Blakely is the Supreme Court's analog to Nance. Just as &sect; 841 provides
a maximum of life imprisonment for distributing cocaine only if the defendant
distributed at least 5 kilograms (or 50 grams of cocaine base)-otherwise
the maximum is 20 or 40 years-so Washington establishes a 10-year maximum
sentence for second-degree kidnapping, but (according to a second statute)
only if the defendant acted with &quot;deliberate cruelty&quot;-otherwise
the maximum is 3 years. Washington contended that the relevant &quot;statutory
maximum&quot; was 10 years; this is equivalent to arguing that the &quot;statutory
maximum&quot; in all federal cocaine prosecutions is life. The Court disagreed
and held that the relevant &quot;statutory maximum&quot; is the lowest of
all arguably pertinent statutory caps, unless the jury makes the finding
that raises the limit.</P>

<P>According to my colleagues, Blakely goes beyond what was necessary to
decide the validity of Washington's system by giving this definition of
&quot;statutory maximum&quot;:</P>

<P>In other words, the relevant &quot;statutory maximum&quot; is not the
maximum sentence a judge may impose after finding additional facts, but
the maximum he may impose without any additional findings. When a judge
inflicts punishment that the jury's verdict alone does not allow, the jury
has not found all the facts &quot;which the law makes essential to the punishment,&quot;
. . . and the judge exceeds his proper authority.</P>

<P>Slip op. 7 (emphasis in original). I do not see here the startling consequences
my colleagues find. This says exactly what we held in Nance: one must start
with the lowest statutory maximum and ask the jury to make findings that
raise the sentence to which the defendant is exposed.</P>

<P>Blakely arose from a need to designate one of two statutes as the &quot;statutory
maximum&quot;. Washington called its statutes &quot;sentencing guidelines,&quot;
but names do not change facts. Nonetheless, the reading my colleagues give
to this passage is that it does not matter whether the maximum is statutory;
any legal rule, of any source (statute, regulation, guideline) that affects
a sentence must go to a jury. Certainly Blakely does not hold that; it could
not &quot;hold&quot; that given that it dealt with statutes exclusively.
Attributing to Blakely the view that it does not matter whether a given
rule appears in a statute makes hash of &quot;statutory maximum.&quot; Why
did the Justices deploy that phrase in Apprendi and repeat it in Blakely
(and quite a few other decisions)? Just to get a chuckle at the expense
of other judges who took them seriously and thought that &quot;statutory
maximum&quot; might have something to do with statutes? Why write &quot;statutory
maximum&quot; if you mean &quot;all circumstances that go into ascertaining
the proper sentence&quot;?</P>

<P>Going Blakely one better, today's majority says that as a matter of constitutional
law there cannot be any difference between statutes and other sources of
rules: &quot;it is hard to believe that the fact that the guidelines are
promulgated by the U.S. Sentencing Commission rather than by a legislature
can make a difference. The Commission is exercising power delegated to it
by Congress, and if a legislature cannot evade what the Supreme Court deems
the commands of the Constitution by a multistage sentencing scheme neither,
it seems plain, can a regulatory agency.&quot; Slip op. 3-4. For the vital
proposition that anything functionally equivalent to a statute (from the
perspective of a criminal defendant) must be treated as a statute, the majority
cites-nothing. Phrases such as &quot;it seems plain&quot; are poor substitutes
for authority in the Constitution's text or interpretive history.</P>

<P>The majority's proposition is refuted by Blakely itself, which tells
us that legislatures may delegate such issues to the judiciary and parole
boards without offending the sixth amendment. The Court considered whether
there would be a constitutional problem with open-ended sentencing, such
as a statute allowing any person convicted of burglary to be sentenced to
any term of years up to 40. Blakely, slip op. 12-14. If the law left that
decision to the judiciary, the court said, there would be no problem even
if the sentencing judge applied (as a matter of common law) the rule &quot;10
years unless the burglar uses a gun; if a gun, then 40 years.&quot; Put
that algorithm in a statute and the sixth amendment commits to the jury
the question whether the burglar was armed; put the same algorithm in a
judicial opinion and the sixth amendment allows the judge to make the decision.
The Court saw this not as an &quot;evasion&quot; but as a natural application
of the Constitution.</P>

<P>&quot;Statutory&quot; in the phrase &quot;statutory maximum&quot; is
not an inept short-hand. Apprendi and Blakely hold that the sixth amendment
allocates to the jury all elements of the offense, plus all statutory details
that are enough like elements that differences in phraseology should not
be allowed to affect the defendant's rights. Example: the statutory quantity
thresholds in &sect; 841 are not &quot;elements&quot; of that offense, see
United States v. Bjorkman, 270 F.3d 482 (7th Cir. 2001), because a low quantity
does not lead to acquittal; distributing any detectable quantity is a criminal
offense. But the statute works much as if Congress had enacted multiple
degrees of a crime. Just as the distinctions between manslaughter and first-degree
murder (such as malice aforethought) must be proved to a jury's satisfaction,
so the distinctions between simple and aggravated distribution must be shown.
Blakely treated Washington has having established three degrees of kidnapping:
the distinction between second- and third-degree kidnapping was deliberate
cruelty. Having embedded this distinction in its statute books, the Court
held, Washington could not cut the jury out of the process. This understanding
of the sixth amendment has nothing to do with sentencing if there is only
one degree of an offense (the Court's example of burglary with a 40-year
maximum), or if the defendant has been convicted of the highest degree.
Booker has been convicted of &quot;cocaine distribution in the first degree&quot;
and the jury's verdict authorizes life imprisonment. What happens after
that is unrelated to the sixth amendment. This is why the rule of Apprendi
and Blakely is confined to statutes, why they do not affect statutory minimum
sentences, see Harris v. United States, 536 U.S. 545, 122 S. Ct. 2406, 153
L. Ed. 2d 524 (2002), why regulations and guidelines that affect sentencing
after the &quot;degree&quot; of an offense has been fixed by the jury do
not transgress the limits set by the sixth amendment, and why (capital punishment
aside) Apprendi and Blakely are irrelevant if the jury's verdict authorizes
life imprisonment. See United States v. Smith, 223 F.3d 554 (7th Cir. 2000).</P>

<P>Think of the indeterminate sentence: zero-to-life with release in the
discretion of parole officials. The federal Parole Commission eventually
developed a set of release guidelines designed to ensure consistent treatment
of offenders. See United States v. Addonizio, 442 U.S. 178, 99 S. Ct. 2235,
60 L. Ed. 2d 805 (1979). Parole-release guidelines might say something like:
&quot;Hold bank robbers in prison for 10 years; hold armed bank robbers
for 20; hold armed bank robbers who discharge their weapons or take hostages
for 30; add (or subtract) time from these presumptive numbers to reflect
the size of the heist.&quot; If my colleagues are right, then such a system
violates the sixth amendment. Yet the Justices do not think this a problem,
as parole and other forms of executive clemency don't affect the degree
of the offense and therefore do not undercut the jury's role. See Blakely,
slip op. 13. If parole regulations are valid, why not the federal Sentencing
Guidelines? How could commissioners, but not judges, be free to apply regulations
that depend on how much cocaine the defendant distributed, or whether he
pulled a gun on the teller? Once the jury has determined the degree (and
the statutory consequences) of the offense, both judges and executive officials
constitutionally may take part in determining how much of the statutory
maximum the defendant serves in prison.</P>

<P>One other point about the federal sentencing guidelines: Given the matrix-like
nature of the system and the possibility of departure, see 18 U.S.C. &sect;
3553(b); U.S.S.G. &sect; 5K2.0; Koon v. United States, 518 U.S. 81, 116
S. Ct. 2035, 135 L. Ed. 2d 392 (1996), the only finding that is indispensable
to Booker's sentence is the one specified by statute: did he distribute
more than 50 grams of cocaine base? The jury found beyond a reasonable doubt
that he had. Where in the resulting statutory range of 10 years to life
the actual sentence falls depends on complex interactions among drug quantity,
gun use, violence, role in the offense (was defendant the mastermind or
just a courier?), cooperation, obstruction of justice, criminal history,
and other factors, none of which is a sine qua non in the same sense as
the statutory thresholds. See U.S.S.G. &sect; 2D1.1 (21 pages long and just
a starting point; later chapters provide many adjustments). No answer to
the question &quot;what was the total quantity?&quot; gives any defendant
a legal entitlement to a particular sentence. Lower quantities of drugs
can be counterbalanced by a longer criminal history or a more senior role
in the offense, or the judge may decide that upward departure is appropriate.
Even if Blakely's definition reaches regulations adopted by a body such
as the Sentencing Commission, it requires an extra step (or three) to say
that the jury must make the dozens of findings that matter to the Guidelines'
operation in each case.</P>

<P>Apprendi and Blakely hold that the sixth amendment commits to juries
all statutory sentencing thresholds. Perhaps the Court eventually will hold
that some or all of the additional determinations that affect sentences
under the federal Sentencing Guidelines also are the province of jurors.
But Blakely does not take that step, nor does its intellectual framework
support it-and Edwards holds that the current structure is valid provided
that juries make all decisions that jack the maximum sentences. I would
treat Blakely as holding that, when there are multiple statutory caps, the
&quot;statutory maximum&quot; is the lowest one and the jury must determine
whether statutory thresholds to increased ranges have been satisfied. To
read more into Blakely is to attribute to that opinion something beyond
its holding, and to overthrow the real holdings of other decisions.</P>

<P>Today's decision will discombobulate the whole criminal-law docket. I
trust that our superiors will have something to say about this. Soon.</P>

<P>The Opinion issued July 9 is amended by adding the following sentence

<P>Because the government does not argue that Booker's Sixth Amendment challenge
to the guidelines was forfeited by not being made in the district court,
we need not consider the application of the doctrine of plain error, e.g.,
United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 731 (1993), to challenges inspired
by the Blakely decision.</P>

<P>APPENDIX C</P>

<P>UNITED STATES v. BOOKER</P>

<P>ORAL ARGUMENT, JULY 6, 2004</P>

<P>UNOFFICIALLY TRANSCRIBED FROM AUDIO RECORDING</P>

<P>This excerpt begins at approximately 19:41 into the argument, about midway
through the government's argument:</P>

<P>MS. OLSON: If I could just quickly proceed to the government's second
point. We believe that until the Supreme Court says otherwise, Blakely does
not apply to the federal Guidelines. But we do want to say that in the event
that lower courts disagree with that position, and hold that sentencing
under the federal guidelines must comport with Blakely's procedural requirements,
then the question is whether that's possible. And in some cases it will
be</P>

<P>Q: Whether it's what?</P>

<P>MS. OLSON: Whether it's possible to sentence someone under the federal
guidelines in a way that comports with Blakely. And in some cases that will
be possible where, for example, the sentencing judge determines that there
are no applicable guidelines provisions that would call for enhancements
based on facts beyond those either admitted by the defendant or established
in the jury verdict. And there are other cases, if the defendant waives
his right to be sentenced under Blakely or if on appeal any Blakely error
doesn't</P>

<P>Q: What if the whole federal sentencing guidelines scheme [inaudible]</P>

<P>MS. OLSON: And that's the third possibility, your honor. That's the government's
third point. If this court holds, or if any circuit court or district court
concludes that sentencing under the federal guidelines must comport with
Blakely, but the sentencing judge finds that there are in fact applicable
sentencing provisions, guidelines provisions that would call for enhancements
based on facts beyond those either established in the jury verdict or admitted
by the defendant, then the government's position is that the guidelines
as a whole may not be constitutionally applied. We believe that any attempt
to overlay</P>

<P>Q: But really the judge could always treat the guidelines as recommendations,
couldn't he? even if they were unconstitu . . . I mean the guidelines aren't
going to be held unconstitutional. The question is whether the guidelines
can require judges to impose sentences in particular cases.</P>

<P>MS. OLSON: Exactly, your honor. And in fact even if the guidelines as
a whole cannot constitutionally be applied the result, we believe, would
be that the judge would exercise traditional judicial discretion to impose
a sentence, and in that case it would be the government's position in every
case to urge the sentencing judge to draw from the guidelines, and to impose
a sentence that would comport with the sentence available under the guidelines.</P>

<P>Q: You wouldn't go back to the system as before the guidelines were implemented.
That is, where the judge had virtual total discretion within the statutory
maximum.</P>

<P>MS. OLSON: If the guidelines cannot constitutionally be applied, then
we would . . . then the judge's discretion would be pre-guidelines discretion.
But we believe that the sentencing commission over almost twenty years now
of modification and tinkering and experimentation has in fact come up with
a very valuable method of taking the factors that judges have traditionally
used in sentencing, and determining how those should properly be weighed
so that the result is in fact a sentence that is fair and appropriate</P>

<P>REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF APPELLANT'S<BR>
COUNSEL KELLY:<BR>
</P>

<P>MR. KELLY: It's our position that Blakely doesn't require the sentencing
guidelines to be found unconstitutional in their entirety. It merely requires
that any fact which needs to be found in order to increase a sentence needs
to be found by a jury or admitted by the defendant during his plea. [inaudible]</P>

<P>3. Section 3553 of Title 18 of the United States Code, titled &quot;Imposition
of a Sentence,&quot; provides, in relevant part, as follows:</P>

<P>(a) Factors to be considered in imposing a sentence.-The court shall
impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply
with the purposes set forth in paragraph (2) of this subsection. The court,
in determining the particular sentence to be imposed, shall consider-</P>

<P>(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics
of the defendant;</P>

<P>(2) the need for the sentence imposed-</P>

<P>(A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for
the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense;</P>

<P>(B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct;</P>

<P>(C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and</P>

<P>(D) to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training,
medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner;</P>

<P>(3) the kinds of sentences available;</P>

<P>(4) the kinds of sentence and the sentencing range established for-</P>

<P>(A) the applicable category of offense committed by the applicable category
of defendant as set forth in the guidelines-</P>

<P>(i) issued by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to section 994(a)(1)
of title 28, United States Code, subject to any amendments made to such
guidelines by act of Congress (regardless of whether such amendments have
yet to be incorporated by the Sentencing Commission into amendments issued
under section 994(p) of title 28); and</P>

<P>(ii) that, except as provided in section 3742(g), are in effect on the
date the defendant is sentenced; or</P>

<P>(B) in the case of a violation of probation or supervised release, the
applicable guidelines or policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission
pursuant to section 994(a)(3) of title 28, United States Code, taking into
account any amendments made to such guidelines or policy statements by act
of Congress (regardless of whether such amendments have yet to be incorporated
by the Sentencing Commission into amendments issued under section 994(p)
of title 28);</P>

<P>(5) any pertinent policy statement-</P>

<P>(A) issued by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to section 994(a)(2)
of title 28, United States Code, subject to any amendments made to such
policy statement by act of Congress (regardless of whether such amendments
have yet to be incorporated by the Sentencing Commission into amendments
issued under section 994(p) of title 28); and</P>

<P>(B) that, except as provided in section 3742(g), is in effect on the
date the defendant is sentenced.</P>

<P>(6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants
with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct; and</P>

<P>(7) the need to provide restitution to any victims of the offense.</P>

<P>(b) Application of guidelines in imposing a sentence.-</P>

<P>(1) In general.-Except as provided in paragraph (2), the court shall
impose a sentence of the kind, and within the range, referred to in subsection
(a)(4) unless the court finds that there exists an aggravating or mitigating
circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration
by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines that should result
in a sentence different from that described. In determining whether a circumstance
was adequately taken into consideration, the court shall consider only the
sentencing guidelines, policy statements, and official commentary of the
Sentencing Commission. In the absence of an applicable sentencing guideline,
the court shall impose an appropriate sentence, having due regard for the
purposes set forth in subsection (a)(2). In the absence of an applicable
sentencing guideline in the case of an offense other than a petty offense,
the court shall also have due regard for the relationship of the sentence
imposed to sentences prescribed by guidelines applicable to similar offenses
and offenders, and to the applicable policy statements of the Sentencing
Commission.</P>

<P>(2) Child crimes and sexual offenses.-</P>

<P>(A) Sentencing.-In sentencing a defendant convicted of an offense under
section 1201 involving a minor victim, an offense under section 1591, or
an offense under chapter 71, 109A, 110, or 117, the court shall impose a
sentence of the kind, and within the range, referred to in subsection (a)(4)
unless-</P>

<P>(i) the court finds that there exists an aggravating circumstance of
a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing
Commission in formulating the guidelines that should result in a sentence
greater than that described;</P>

<P>(ii) the court finds that there exists a mitigating circumstance of a
kind or to a degree, that-</P>

<P>(I) has been affirmatively and specifically identified as a permissible
ground of downward departure in the sentencing guidelines or policy statements
issued under section 994(a) of title 28, taking account of any amendments
to such sentencing guidelines or policy statements by Congress;</P>

<P>(II) has not been taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission
in formulating the guidelines; and</P>

<P>(III) should result in a sentence different from that described; or</P>

<P>(iii) the court finds, on motion of the Government, that the defendant
has provided substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution
of another person who has committed an offense and that this assistance
established a mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately
taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the
guidelines that should result in a sentence lower than that described.</P>

<P>In determining whether a circumstance was adequately taken into consideration,
the court shall consider only the sentencing guidelines, policy statements,
and official commentary of the Sentencing Commission, together with any
amendments thereto by act of Congress. In the absence of an applicable sentencing
guideline, the court shall impose an appropriate sentence, having due regard
for the purposes set forth in subsection (a)(2). In the absence of an applicable
sentencing guideline in the case of an offense other than a petty offense,
the court shall also have due regard for the relationship of the sentence
imposed to sentences prescribed by guidelines applicable to similar offenses
and offenders, and to the applicable policy statements of the Sentencing
Commission, together with any amendments to such guidelines or policy statements
by act of Congress.</P>

<P>(c) Statement of reasons for imposing a sentence. -The court, at the
time of sentencing, shall state in open court the reasons for its imposition
of the particular sentence, and, if the sentence-</P>

<P>(1) is of the kind, and within the range, described in subsection (a)(4)
and that range exceeds 24 months, the reason for imposing a sentence at
a particular point within the range; or</P>

<P>(2) is not of the kind, or is outside the range, described in subsection
(a)(4), the specific reason for the imposition of a sentence different from
that described, which reasons must also be stated with specificity in the
written order of judgment and commitment, except to the extent that the
court relies upon statements received in camera in accordance with Federal
Rule of Criminal Procedure 32. In the event that the court relies upon statements
received in camera in accordance with Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure
32 the court shall state that such statements were so received and that
it relied upon the content of such statements.</P>

<P>If the court does not order restitution, or orders only partial restitution,
the court shall include in the statement the reason therefor. The court
shall provide a transcription or other appropriate public record of the
court's statement of reasons, together with the order of judgment and commitment,
to the Probation System and to the Sentencing Commission, and, if the sentence
includes a term of imprisonment, to the Bureau of Prisons.</P>

<P>4. Section 3742 of Title 18 United States Code, titled &quot;Review of
a sentence,&quot; provides as follows:</P>

<P>(a) Appeal by a defendant.-A defendant may file a notice of appeal in
the district court for review of an otherwise final sentence if the sentence-</P>

<P>(1) was imposed in violation of law;</P>

<P>(2) was imposed as a result of an incorrect application of the sentencing
guidelines; or</P>

<P>(3) is greater than the sentence specified in the applicable guideline
range to the extent that the sentence includes a greater fine or term of
imprisonment, probation, or supervised release than the maximum established
in the guideline range, or includes a more limiting condition</P>

<P>of probation or supervised release under section 3563(b)(6) or (b)(11)
than the maximum established in the guideline range; or</P>

<P>(4) was imposed for an offense for which there is no sentencing guideline
and is plainly unreasonable.</P>

<P>(b) Appeal by the Government.-The Government may file a notice of appeal
in the district court for review of an otherwise final sentence if the sentence-</P>

<P>(1) was imposed in violation of law;</P>

<P>(2) was imposed as a result of an incorrect application of the sentencing
guidelines;</P>

<P>(3) is less than the sentence specified in the applicable guideline range
to the extent that the sentence includes a lesser fine or term of imprisonment,
probation, or supervised release than the minimum established in the guideline
range, or includes a less limiting condition of probation or supervised
release under section 3563(b)(6) or (b)(11) than the minimum established
in the guideline range; or</P>

<P>(4) was imposed for an offense for which there is no sentencing guideline
and is plainly unreasonable.</P>

<P>The Government may not further prosecute such appeal without the personal
approval of the Attorney General, the Solicitor General, or a deputy solicitor
general designated by the Solicitor General.</P>

<P>(c) Plea agreements.-In the case of a plea agreement that includes a
specific sentence under rule 11(e)(1)(C) of the Federal Rules of Criminal
Procedure-</P>

<P>(1) a defendant may not file a notice of appeal under paragraph (3) or
(4) of subsection (a) unless the sentence imposed is greater than the sentence
set forth in such agreement; and</P>

<P>(2) the Government may not file a notice of appeal under paragraph (3)
or (4) of subsection (b) unless the sentence imposed is less than the sentence
set forth in such agreement.</P>

<P>(d) Record on review.-If a notice of appeal is filed in the district
court pursuant to subsection (a) or (b), the clerk shall certify to the
court of appeals-</P>

<P>(1) that portion of the record in the case that is designated as pertinent
by either of the parties;</P>

<P>(2) the presentence report; and</P>

<P>(3) the information submitted during the sentencing proceeding.</P>

<P>(e) Consideration.-Upon review of the record, the court of appeals shall
determine whether the sentence-</P>

<P>(1) was imposed in violation of law;</P>

<P>(2) was imposed as a result of an incorrect application of the sentencing
guidelines;</P>

<P>(3) is outside the applicable guideline range, and</P>

<P>(A) the district court failed to provide the written statement of reasons
required by section 3553(c);</P>

<P>(B) the sentence departs from the applicable guideline range based on
a factor that-</P>

<P>(i) does not advance the objectives set forth in section 3553(a)(2);
or</P>

<P>(ii) is not authorized under section 3553(b); or</P>

<P>(iii) is not justified by the facts of the case; or</P>

<P>(C) the sentence departs to an unreasonable degree from the applicable
guidelines range, having regard for the factors to be considered in imposing
a sentence, as set forth in section 3553(a) of this title and the reasons
for the imposition of the particular sentence, as stated by the district
court pursuant to the provisions of section 3553(c); or</P>

<P>(4) was imposed for an offense for which there is no applicable sentencing
guideline and is plainly unreasonable.</P>

<P>The court of appeals shall give due regard to the opportunity of the
district court to judge the credibility of the witnesses, and shall accept
the findings of fact of the district court unless they are clearly erroneous
and, except with respect to determinations under subsection (3)(A) or (3)(B),

been filed under subsection (b), it shall set aside the sentence and remand
the case for further sentencing proceedings with such instructions as the
court considers appropriate, subject to subsection (g);</P>

<P>(3) the sentence is not described in paragraph (1) or (2), it shall affirm
the sentence.</P>

<P>(g) Sentencing upon remand.-A district court to which a case is remanded
pursuant to subsection (f)(1) or (f)(2) shall resentence a defendant in
accordance with section 3553 and with such instructions as may have been
given by the court of appeals, except that-</P>

<P>(1) In determining the range referred to in subsection 3553(a)(4), the
court shall apply the guidelines issued by the Sentencing Commission pursuant
to section 994(a)(1) of title 28, United States Code, and that were in effect
on the date of the previous sentencing of the defendant prior to the appeal,
together with any amendments thereto by any act of Congress that was in
effect on such date; and</P>

<P>(2) The court shall not impose a sentence outside the applicable guidelines
range except upon a ground that-</P>

<P>(A) was specifically and affirmatively included in the written statement
of reasons required by section 3553(c) in connection with the previous sentencing
of the defendant prior to the appeal; and</P>

<P>(B) was held by the court of appeals, in remanding the case, to be a
permissible ground of departure.</P>

<P>(h) Application to a sentence by a magistrate judge.-An appeal of an
otherwise final sentence imposed by a United States magistrate judge may
be taken to a judge of the district court, and this section shall apply
(except for the requirement of approval by the Attorney General or the Solicitor
General in the case of a Government appeal) as though the appeal were to
a court of appeals from a sentence imposed by a district court.</P>

<P>(i) Guideline not expressed as a range.-For the purpose of this section,
the term &quot;guideline range&quot; includes a guideline range having the
same upper and lower limits.</P>

<P>(j) Definitions.-For purposes of this section-</P>

<P>(1) a factor is a &quot;permissible&quot; ground of departure if it-</P>

<P>(A) advances the objectives set forth in section 3553(a)(2); and</P>

<P>(B) is authorized under section 3553(b); and</P>

<P>(C) is justified by the facts of the case; and</P>

of general sentencing practices; and</P>

<P>(C) reflect, to the extent practicable, advancement in knowledge of human
behavior as it relates to the criminal justice process; and</P>

or a term of imprisonment;</P>

<P>(B) a determination as to the appropriate amount of a fine or the appropriate
length of a term of probation or a term of imprisonment;</P>

include a requirement that the defendant be placed on a term of supervised
release after imprisonment, and, if so, the appropriate length of such a
term;</P>

should be ordered to run concurrently or consecutively; and</P>

<P>(E) a determination under paragraphs (6) and (11) of section 3563(b)

<P>(2) If a sentence specified by the guidelines includes a term of imprisonment,
the maximum of the range established for such a term shall not exceed the
minimum of that range by more than the greater of 25 percent or 6 months,
except that, if the minimum term of the range is 30 years or more, the maximum
may be life imprisonment.</P>

<P>* Notes to Drug Quantity Table:</P>

<P>(A) Unless otherwise specified, the weight of a controlled substance
set forth in the table refers to the entire weight of any mixture or substance
containing a detectable amount of the controlled substance. If a mixture
or substance contains more than one controlled substance, the weight of
the entire mixture or substance is assigned to the controlled substance
that results in the greater offense level.</P>

<P>* * * * *</P>

<P>(D) &quot;Cocaine base,&quot; for the purposes of this guideline, means
&quot;crack.&quot; &quot;Crack&quot; is the street name for a form of cocaine
base, usually prepared by processing cocaine hydrochloride and sodium bicarbonate,
and usually appearing in a lumpy, rocklike form.</P>

<P>* * * * *</P>

<P>(F) In the case of Schedule I or II Depressants, Schedule III substances
(except anabolic steroids), Schedule IV substances, and Schedule V substances,
one &quot;unit&quot; means one pill, capsule, or tablet. If the substance
is in liquid form, one &quot;unit&quot; means 0.5 gm.</P>

<P>11. United States Sentencing Guidelines &sect; 3B1.1 titled &quot;Aggravating
Role,&quot; provides, in relevant part, as follows:</P>

<P>Based on the defendant's role in the offense, increase the offense level
as follows:</P>

<P>(a) If the defendant was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity
that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive, increase
by 4 levels.</P>

<P>(b) If the defendant was a manager or supervisor (but not an organizer
or leader) and the criminal activity involved five or more participants
or was otherwise extensive, increase by 3 levels.</P>

<P>(c) If the defendant was an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor
in any criminal activity other than described in (a) or (b), increase by
2 levels.</P>

or Impeding the Administration of Justice,&quot; provides, in relevant part,
as follows:</P>

<P>If (A) the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to
obstruct or impede, the administration of justice during the course of the
investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction,
and (B) the obstructive conduct related to (i) the defendant's offense of
conviction and any relevant conduct; or (ii) a closely related offense,
increase the offense level by 2 levels.</P>

<P>13. United States Sentencing Guidelines &sect; 6A1.3 titled &quot;Resolution
of Disputed Factors (Policy Statement,&quot; provides as follows:</P>

<P>(a) When any factor important to the sentencing determination is reasonably
in dispute, the parties shall be given an adequate opportunity to present
information to the court regarding that factor. In resolving any dispute
concerning a factor important to the sentencing determination, the court
may consider relevant information without regard to its admissibility under
the rules of evidence applicable at trial, provided that the information
has sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.</P>

<P>(b) The court shall resolve disputed sentencing factors at a sentencing
hearing in accordance with Rule 32(c)(1), Fed. R. Crim. P.</P>

<P>Commentary</P>

<P>In pre-guidelines practice, factors relevant to sentencing were often
determined in an informal fashion. The informality was to some extent explained
by the fact that particular offense and offender characteristics rarely
had a highly specific or required sentencing consequence. This situation
no longer exists under sentencing guidelines. The court's resolution of
disputed sentencing factors usually has a measurable effect on the applicable
punishment. More formality is therefore unavoidable if the sentencing process
is to be accurate and fair.</P>

<P>Although lengthy sentencing hearings seldom should be necessary, disputes
about sentencing factors must be resolved with care. When a dispute exists
about any factor important to the sentencing determination, the court must
ensure that the parties have an adequate opportunity to present relevant
information. Written statements of counsel or affidavits of witnesses may
be adequate under many circumstances. See, e.g., United States v. Ibanez,
924 F.2d 427 (2d Cir. 1991). An evidentiary hearing may sometimes be the
only reliable way to resolve disputed issues. See, e.g., United States v.
Jimenez Martinez, 83 F.3d 488, 494-95 (1st Cir. 1996) (finding error in
district court's denial of defendant's motion for evidentiary hearing given
questionable reliability of affidavit on which the district court relied
at sentencing); United States v. Roberts, 14 F.3d 502, 521(10th Cir. 1993)
(remanding because district court did not hold evidentiary hearing to address
defendants' objections to drug quantity determination or make requisite
findings of fact regarding drug quantity); see also, United States v. Fatico,
603 F.2d 1053, 1057 n.9 (2d Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1073 (1980).
The sentencing court must determine the appropriate procedure in light of
the nature of the dispute, its relevance to the sentencing determination,
and applicable case law.</P>

<P>In determining the relevant facts, sentencing judges are not restricted
to information that would be admissible at trial. See 18 U.S.C. &sect; 3661;
see also United States v. Watts, 117 S. Ct. 633, 635 (1997) (holding that
lower evidentiary standard at sentencing permits sentencing court's consideration
of acquitted conduct); Witte v. United States, 515 U.S. 389, 399-401 (1995)
(noting that sentencing courts have traditionally considered wide range
of information without the procedural protections of a criminal trial, including
information concerning criminal conduct that may be the subject of a subsequent
prosecution); Nichols v. United States, 511 U.S. 738, 747-48 (1994) (noting
that district courts have traditionally considered defendant's prior criminal
conduct even when the conduct did not result in a conviction). Any information
may be considered, so long as it has sufficient indicia of reliability to
support its probable accuracy. Watts, 117 S. Ct. at 637; Nichols , 511 U.S.
at 748; United States v. Zuleta-Alvarez, 922 F.2d 33 (1st Cir. 1990), cert.
denied, 500 U.S. 927 (1991; United States v. Beaulieu, 893 F.2d 1177 (10th
Cir.), cert. denied, 497 U.S. 1038 (1990). Reliable hearsay evidence may
be considered. United States v. Petty, 982 F.2d 1365 (9th Cir. 1993), cert.
denied, 510 U.S. 1040 (1994); United States v. Sciarrino, 884 F.2d 95 (3d
Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 997 (1989). Out-of-court declarations by an
unidentified informant may be considered where there is good cause for the
non-disclosure of the informant's identity and there is sufficient corroboration
by other means. United States v. Rogers, 1 F.3d 341 (5th Cir. 1993); see
also United States v. Young, 981 F.2d 180 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 508
U.S. 980 (1993); United States v. Fatico, 579 F.2d 707, 713 (2d Cir. 1978),
cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1073 (1980). Unreliable allegations shall not be
considered. United States v. Ortiz, 993 F.2d 204 (10th Cir. 1993).</P>

<P>The Commission believes that use of a preponderance of the evidence standard
is appropriate to meet due process requirements and policy concerns in resolving
disputes regarding application of the guidelines to the facts of a case.
