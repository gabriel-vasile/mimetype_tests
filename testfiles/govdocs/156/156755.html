The appellate roundelay began when<br><br>          Metcalf  & Eddy,  Inc. (M&E)  sued the  Puerto Rico  Aqueduct and<br><br>          Sewer  Authority (PRASA)  for  damages in  Puerto Rico's  federal<br><br>          district court.  In the course of pretrial proceedings, the court<br><br>          denied PRASA the  benefit of  Eleventh Amendment  immunity.   The<br><br>          disappointed   defendant   essayed   an   interlocutory   appeal.<br><br>          Following circuit precedent, see Libby  v. Marshall, 833 F.2d 402<br>                                       ___ _____     ________<br><br>          (1st   Cir.  1987),   we  dismissed  the   appeal  for   want  of<br><br>          jurisdiction.  M&E  v. PRASA, 945  F.2d 10,  14 (1st Cir.  1991).<br>                         ___     _____<br><br>          The Supreme  Court granted certiorari and,  resolving an existing<br><br>          split in  the circuits, determined that  pretrial orders granting<br><br>          or  denying   Eleventh   Amendment  immunity   were   immediately<br><br>          appealable.  PRASA v. M&E, 113 S. Ct. 684, 689 (1993).<br>                       _____    ___<br><br>                    PRASA's appeal returns to us on remand from the Supreme<br><br>          Court.   This  time  around, we  must address  the merits  of the<br><br>          ruling  below.      After  reviewing   supplemental  briefs   and<br><br>          considering  PRASA's  overall   relationship  with  the   central<br><br>          government of Puerto Rico, we  affirm the district court's denial<br><br>          of Eleventh Amendment immunity.<br><br>                                          I.<br>                                          I.<br>                                          __<br><br>                                  Setting the Stage<br>                                  Setting the Stage<br>                                  _________________<br><br>                    Puerto  Rico's  legislature  created PRASA  over  forty<br><br>          years ago in order to provide safe drinking water for inhabitants<br><br>          and  to manage wastewater treatment.  See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 22,<br>                                                ___<br><br><br>                                          2<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>             141-168 (1987 & Supp. 1989).  PRASA's stewardship has not been<br><br>          without blemish.  The incident that sparked this suit occurred in<br><br>          1985,  when  the United  States  Environmental  Protection Agency<br><br>          (EPA)  brought an enforcement action  pursuant to the Clean Water<br><br>          Act,  33  U.S.C.      1251-1376  (1988),  seeking  to  provoke  a<br><br>          substantial   modernization   of  PRASA's   wastewater  treatment<br><br>          facilities.<br><br>                    In due  course, PRASA  and EPA signed  a consent  order<br><br>          limning the  changes necessary to bring  PRASA's treatment system<br><br>          into  compliance.     Toward  that  end,   PRASA  hired  M&E,   a<br><br>          Massachusetts-based engineering firm with professed  expertise in<br><br>          wastewater  management,  to  oversee  the  refurbishment.   M&E's<br><br>          duties  included contracting for design and construction services<br><br>          on PRASA's behalf, procuring necessary equipment, and supervising<br><br>          work on the  project.  M&E was to be  remunerated on a time-plus-<br><br>          expense basis, invoiced as  accrued.  Bills were due  and payable<br><br>          within thirty days of presentment.<br><br>                    Over time, project  expenditures mushroomed well beyond<br><br>          budget.   As costs mounted, PRASA  grew increasingly inhospitable<br><br>          to M&E's  invoices.  The  denouement occurred when  PRASA, amidst<br><br>          charges  of  skulduggery,  suspended  all  payments  to  M&E  and<br><br>          demanded a complete audit.   M&E consented to the audit,  but did<br><br>          not acquiesce in the cessation of payments.  The audit dragged on<br><br>          and  PRASA accumulated  a huge  stockpile of  M&E invoices.   Its<br><br>          financial plight ingravescent, M&E sued before  the audit had run<br><br>          its   course  to   force  payment   of  the   arrearage  (roughly<br><br><br>                                          3<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          $52,000,000).<br><br>                    Confronted  by  defendant's  motion  to   dismiss,  the<br><br>          district court determined as a  matter of law that PRASA did  not<br><br>          enjoy  Eleventh Amendment  immunity.   In so  holding,  the court<br><br>          stressed  that PRASA possessed  the "ability  to raise  funds for<br><br>          payment  of   its  contractual   obligations"   and,  thus,   its<br><br>          obligations  "do not  affect  the Commonwealth's  funds."   PRASA<br><br>          appeals  this decision as a  legal rather than  a factual matter.<br><br>          Although there may  sometimes be genuine issues  of material fact<br><br>          sufficient to preclude  brevis disposition in Eleventh  Amendment<br>                                  ______<br><br>          litigation,  there are none here.   Agreeing with  PRASA that the<br><br>          issue in this case is one of law, we afford plenary review to the<br><br>          district court's denial  of immunity.

Georgia, 2  U.S. (2 Dall.)  419 (1793),<br>                       ________     _______<br><br>          the  Supreme Court held that  the federal courts had jurisdiction<br><br>          to  hear a  South Carolina  citizen's suit  against the  State of<br><br>          Georgia.  This result,  popularly perceived as a threat  to state<br><br>          autonomy  in   a  newly   minted  federal  system,   produced  an<br><br>          overwhelmingly  negative reaction.   See  Edelman v.  Jordan, 415<br>                                               ___  _______     ______<br><br><br>                                          4<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          U.S.  651, 662  (1974).  Ratification  of the  Eleventh Amendment<br><br>          followed apace.1<br><br>                    On  its face,  the  amendment appeared  to introduce  a<br><br>          fairly  simple proposition into our constitutional jurisprudence.<br><br>          Nevertheless,  driven by  the  pressure of  pragmatic  necessity,<br><br>          judicial sketching of the  amendment's scope and requirements has<br><br>          displayed  a creative  bent.   Under the  gloss supplied  by this<br><br>          abstract impressionistic  flair, the federal courts  now read the<br><br>          Eleventh  Amendment,  notwithstanding   its  plain  language,  to<br><br>          prohibit  them from hearing most suits brought against a state by<br><br>          citizens  of that  or any  other state.2   See  De Leon  Lopez v.<br>                                                     ___  ______________<br><br>          Corporacion Insular de Seguros, 931 F.2d 116, 121 (1st Cir. 1991)<br>          ______________________________<br><br>          (collecting cases); see also Edelman, 415 U.S. at 662-63.<br>                              ___ ____ _______<br><br>                    Withal, there are apertures in the Eleventh Amendment's<br><br>          protective  swaddling.  If a case falls within one of these gaps,<br><br>          the Eleventh Amendment will not bar  maintenance of the suit in a<br><br>          federal  court.  See Ramirez v.

The existence of this<br><br>          statutory  barrier presages the result  we must reach:   PRASA is<br><br>          not an arm of the state for Eleventh Amendment purposes.5<br><br>                    PRASA argues that,  notwithstanding the  Commonwealth's<br><br>          disavowal  of its  liabilities,  the  Commonwealth's  significant<br><br>          financial support  of PRASA's activities constitutes  the sort of<br><br>          access  to   public  funds   that  triggers   Eleventh  Amendment<br><br>          protection.   We do not  agree.  Although  the central government<br><br>          subsidizes the agency to some extent, PRASA relies mostly on user<br><br>          fees  and bonds to support  its operations.   The government does<br><br>          not  give PRASA a blank  check or an  indeterminant carte blanche<br><br>          allowing  it  to  draw  on  the  public  treasury  as  it  thinks<br><br>          necessary.  Thus, control  of the money flow from  tax dollars is<br><br>          unilateral; if the Commonwealth  chooses not to open  the faucet,<br><br>          the agency must go thirsty or else, by resort to its own devices,<br><br>          procure the funds needed to stay liquid.<br><br>                    We think  PRASA's situation  is  not unlike  that of  a<br><br>          typical  political subdivision.   Such  an entity  often receives<br><br>          part  of  its  budget   from  the  state  and  raises   the  rest<br><br>          independently.   Despite this dual  funding, such entities do not<br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>               5The statutory barrier is especially important in this case,<br>          for  Puerto Rico's  legislature  has demonstrated  that, when  it<br>          wishes  to  do   so,  it   knows  exactly  how   to  pledge   the<br>          Commonwealth's resources in security for PRASA's debts.

The  case at<br>                          _____ ______<br><br>          bar is cut from much the same cloth.<br><br>                    We hold,  therefore, that  a state agency  cannot claim<br><br>          Eleventh Amendment  immunity solely  on the basis  that judgments<br><br>          against  it may  absorb unrestricted funds  donated by  the state<br><br>          and,  in that  way, redound  indirectly to  the depletion  of the<br><br>          state's treasury.  It follows that PRASA's assertion  of Eleventh<br><br>          Amendment immunity in this case is severely flawed.<br><br>                    2.  Other Factors.  Although PRASA's  inability to draw<br>                    2.

In the  circumstances at  hand,<br><br><br>                                          12<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          these factors,  taken as an aggregate, corroborate  the view that<br><br>          PRASA does not dwell within the Eleventh Amendment's shelter.<br><br>                    To  be  sure,  the  two  pans  of  the  scale  are  not<br><br>          completely  out  of balance.   PRASA  to  some extent  wields the<br><br>          state's  power; after  all,  the enabling  legislation  describes<br><br>          PRASA's mission to provide water and sewer services as fulfilling<br><br>          "an  essential government function."   P.R. Laws Ann.  tit. 22,  <br><br>          142.   Additionally,  neither PRASA  nor  its revenue  bonds  are<br><br>          taxable, see id.   155; PRASA enjoys the power of eminent domain,<br>                   ___ ___<br><br>          see id.   144(e); and the  Governor of Puerto Rico appoints  five<br>          ___ ___<br><br>          of PRASA's seven board members, see id.   143.<br>                                          ___ ___<br><br>                    PRASA places  particular emphasis on the  fact that its<br><br>          water   and  sewage   functions  are  governmental   rather  than<br><br>          proprietary and insists that this circumstance renders  it an arm<br><br>          of the  state.6  But the  nature of PRASA's function  is only one<br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>               6In arguing this point, PRASA leans heavily on  our decision<br>          in  Puerto Rico Ports Auth. v.  M/V Manhattan Prince, 897 F.2d 1,<br>              _______________________     ____________________<br>          12 (1st  Cir. 1990).   This reliance  is mislaid.   In  Manhattan<br>                                                                  _________<br>          Prince,  the Ports Authority was  acting only as  the licensor of<br>          ______<br>          harbor  pilots for whom it provided no  training and over whom it<br>          exercised no assignment power.  The Authority derived no  revenue<br>          from  the  licensing function.    Moreover,  the legislature  had<br>          explicitly  made  Authority  members'  misfeasance  of  the  kind<br>          alleged   in   Manhattan   Prince   attributable  only   to   the<br>                         __________________<br>          Commonwealth.

Puerto Rico Ports Auth., 973 F.2d 8 (1st  Cir.<br>          _______________    _______________________<br>          1992).   That case involved  not licensing, but  operation of the<br>          ports.  See  id. at 9.  Because the  Ports Authority charged user<br>                  ___  ___<br>          fees  that supported  the costs  of its  port operations  and was<br>          relatively free of central  government control, we ruled  that it<br>          did not  enjoy Eleventh Amendment  immunity with  respect to  its<br>          management of the ports.

Educational<br><br>          services, for  example, are, like water  treatment, a traditional<br><br>          governmental function.   Education, however, has  an even longer,<br><br>          stronger  governmental  history  than  water  treatment,  and  as<br><br>          attendance requirements attest, a  more entrenched place in state<br><br>          government.  Yet, despite  these more evocative  characteristics,<br><br>          school boards  are not immune from  suits in federal court.   See<br>                                                                        ___<br><br>          Mt. Healthy, 429 U.S. at 280-81 (holding that school board is not<br>          ___________<br><br>          entitled to assert Eleventh Amendment immunity).<br><br>                    On  the other  side of  the scale,  a heftier  array of<br><br>          indicators  suggests that  PRASA is  distinct from  Puerto Rico's<br><br>          central government.  PRASA  has the power to raise  funds through<br><br>          user fees  (which, significantly,  the Commonwealth, as  a water-<br><br>          and-sewer  user, must  pay with  respect to its  own operations).<br><br>          See P.R. Laws Ann.  tit. 22,   158.  PRASA also  has the right to<br>          ___<br><br>          raise funds by issuing revenue bonds independently of the central<br><br>          government.   See  id.     152.   The  power and  opportunity  to<br>                        ___  ___<br><br>          generate  a  revenue  stream  and  thereby  finance  an  agency's<br><br>          operations  is an  important attribute  of the  agency's separate<br><br>          identity.   Cf. Hernandez-Tirado v. Artau, 874 F.2d 866, 872 (1st<br>                      ___ ________________    _____<br><br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>                    We  recognize the  seeming anomaly  in a  single agency<br>          being  held  to  possess  Eleventh Amendment  immunity  for  some<br>          functions but not for others.  However, the two cases cited above<br>          turned on the nature  of the function involved in  each instance,<br>          presumably  because, in  light  of the  Authority's portfolio  of<br>          diverse operations, the question  of access to the Commonwealth's<br>          treasury  was fuliginous.  The  case before us  is free from this<br>          strain of uncertainty.<br><br>                                          14<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          Cir.  1989)  (finding agency  to be  an  arm of  the Commonwealth<br><br>          because  the central government had the sole power to raise money<br><br>          for the agency).   Moreover, bondholders must look only  to PRASA<br><br>          for recompense in the event of default.  See P.R.  Laws Ann. tit.<br>                                                   ___<br><br>          22,   152(I).  Then, too, PRASA is separately incorporated as "an<br><br>          autonomous  government instrumentality."  Id.   142.  It may sue,<br>                                                    ___<br><br>          be  sued,   and  enter   contracts  without  the   Commonwealth's<br><br>          particular permission.

Last,  but surely<br><br>          not least, the Commonwealth  has explicitly insulated itself from<br><br>          any financial responsibility with respect to PRASA's general debt<br><br>          and ordinary bonded indebtedness.7  See id.   144.<br>                                              ___ ___<br><br>                    One more item deserves mention.   Whether an agency  is<br><br>          an  arm of the state  vel non is a matter  of federal, not local,<br>                                ___ ___<br><br>          law.   See Blake, 612 F.2d  at 722.  Nevertheless,  it is notable<br>                 ___ _____<br><br>          that the district court's  view of PRASA as a  separate political<br><br>          subdivision  rather than  as  a part  of  the central  government<br><br>          comports with that of Puerto Rico's highest tribunal.  The Puerto<br><br>          Rico Supreme Court  has consistently concluded that  PRASA is not<br><br>          an alter ego  of the central government.  The court observed over<br><br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>               7PRASA  argues that  because  its  generated revenues  (bond<br>          monies  and  user  fees)  are  "pledged"  to  current  debts  and<br>          projects,  it  will  have no  money  to  pay a  judgment  and any<br>          judgment  creditor  must,  therefore, look  to  the Commonwealth.<br>          This  is specious reasoning.   If M&E prevails  in this suit, it,<br>          like  unsecured judgment  creditors from  time immemorial,  would<br>          bear  the risk that it might find few assets available to satisfy<br>          the judgment.<br><br>                                          15<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          forty years ago  that the  legislature intended PRASA  to "be  as<br><br>          amenable to judicial  process as any private  enterprise would be<br><br>          under like  circumstances . . .  ."

More recently, the court reiterated that PRASA<br><br>          has  a  "personality  separate  and   apart  from  that  of   the<br><br>          government,"     and  does  not  have   the  "sovereign  immunity<br><br>          traditionally enjoyed by the  State."

Assessing the Balance.<br>                         _____________________<br><br>          lacks eligibility  for  Eleventh Amendment  immunity  on  several<br><br>          levels.  First, and most fundamentally, PRASA's inability to  tap<br><br>          the Commonwealth  treasury or  pledge  the Commonwealth's  credit<br><br>          leaves it  unable to exercise  the power of  the purse.   On this<br><br>          basis, PRASA is ill-deserving of Eleventh Amendment protection.<br><br>                    Even putting  aside PRASA's fiscal separation  from the<br><br>          central government, we find  that the sum total of  the secondary<br><br>          factors preponderates against immunity.  While PRASA indisputably<br><br>          operates with some quantum  of state authority, as do  many other<br><br><br>                                          16<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          public  utilities,  it is  readily  apparent  that Puerto  Rico's<br><br>          legislature  chose  to  structure  an  arm's-length  relationship<br><br>          between  PRASA and  the  central government.   To  implement this<br><br>          relationship,  the  legislature gave  PRASA  the  power to  raise<br><br>          funds,  enter contracts, conceive  strategy, and to  make its own<br><br>          operational  decisions.   As  a  consequence  of the  legislative<br><br>          design, the central  government does business  with PRASA in  the<br><br>          same manner as with other  vendors:  it pays for the  services it<br><br>          receives  and  does not  extend  any  credit or  generic  funding<br><br>          guarantees.    When all  the  relevant factors  are  weighed, the<br><br>          indicia of separateness countervail the indicia of togetherness.<br><br><br><br><br><br>                                         III.<br>                                         III.<br>                                         ____<br><br>                                      Conclusion<br>                                      Conclusion<br>                                      __________<br><br>                    We  need go no further.  The profound impact of PRASA's<br><br>          inability  to  reach   the  Commonwealth's   treasury,  and   our<br><br>          calibrating  measurement of the  secondary factors,  dictate that<br><br>          PRASA's assertion of immunity must fail.  Consequently, we  today<br><br>          confirm the suspicions adumbrated in Howard, 744 F.2d at 886:  in<br>                                               ______<br><br>          its  current  incarnation, the  Puerto  Rico  Aqueduct and  Sewer<br><br>          Authority is  not safeguarded from federal  court jurisdiction by<br><br>          the Eleventh  Amendment.
