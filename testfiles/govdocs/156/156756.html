<P ALIGN="justify">To many visitors a drive over the transmountain road,
which bisects the park at right angles to the main ridge, serves as an
excellent cross section to the birdlife of this area. Starting at
Gatlinburg, Tenn., where the elevation is 1,300 feet above sea level, or
at Cherokee, N.C., at 1,900 feet, we find such common permanent
residents as cardinal, Carolina wren, song sparrow, tufted titmouse,
eastern phoebe, Carolina chickadee, and various woodpeckers. During the
breeding season, species which become just as prevalent include the
red-eyed and the yellow-throated vireos, wood thrush, indigo bunting,
Acadian flycatcher, brown thrasher, and such warblers as the yellow,
prairie, black-and-white, hooded, Kentucky, worm-eating,
yellow-throated, and golden-winged, the yellowthroat,
American redstart, ovenbird, yellow-breasted chat,
and Louisiana water thrush. By the time we reach an elevation of
approximately 3,500 feet, such strikingly arrayed breeding birds as the
scarlet tanager and rose-breasted grosbeak might be added to our list,
and from there to the top of the Smokies the birdlife closely resembles
that of northern New England.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Owing to more extensive logging operations in the
years before this area became a National Park, the North Carolina side
of the transmountain road has relatively little spruce and fir below
Newfound Gap (elev., 5,040 ft.); on the Tennessee side, this Canadian-type
forest extends upward from near 4,000 feet. There the wood thrush is
replaced by the veery; the common crow, by the common raven; the
Carolina chickadee, by the black-capped; the screech owl by the
saw-whet. There the common warblers are the chestnut-sided (in the more
open places), Canada and black-throated blue (in rhododendron thickets),
and Blackburnian (in treetops). These high-altitude forests are the
home of the olive-sided flycatcher, whose whistled question, "What
peeves you?", can be heard for great distances.</P>

</TABLE>

<P ALIGN="justify">Whether heard in Maine or in the Great Smokies,
querulous nasal notes of the red-breasted nuthatch, the high-pitched
lisping of the golden-crowned kinglet, the clear whistle of the solitary
vireo, and the thrilling roundelay of the winter wren become associated
with spruce and fir.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The crowlike bird that you may see in these higher
altitudes is, in all probability, a raven; no bird symbolizes the
untamed wilderness atmosphere of these mountains as does this
black-feathered master of flight. If you hear its deep throaty notes
there should be no question concerning its identity, but if the bird
remains silent you might readily identify it by its soaring flight and
wedge-shaped tail. Ravens occasionally utter clear liquid notes,
resembling xylophone music. For many a bird watcher, the experience of
being entertained by the side rolls, dips, and power dives of this
magnificent bird against a background of unspoiled coniferous forests
is more thrilling than the most elaborate man-staged exhibition. The
latter is artificial, whereas the former is as real as the rain, the
mountains, and the growing things. The raven is doing what its ancestors
have done for many millions of years; but mankind, by encroaching ever
more on the wilderness, has also come close to destroying the big
ebony-colored bird, which is just as much a part of the picture as the
unbroken ranks of spruce and fir. National Parks serve to preserve
segments of the American wilderness so that future generations also can
have the opportunity of experiencing some of the breathtaking sights
which Audubon, Lewis and Clark, and Muir experienced.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Although red crossbills often appear in pine forests
at the lower altitudes of the park, these eccentric and gregarious
finches belong rightfully, in the Canadian zone. During some years these
birds are quite plentiful, while at other times they may be rare or
absent. In years gone by when cattle ranged on the high-mountain
meadowlands, the herders knew this as the "salt bird." Crossbills are
exceptionally fond of salt, and since they were very approachable while
feeding on the salt which had been distributed for the benefit of the
cattle, the name they were known by was entirely appropriate. Breeding
takes place in the park, at least in some years, for there have been
observations of the adults feeding young which must have left the nest
but recently. Yet no nest has been discovered in the area. In this
regard the red crossbill is like the saw-whet owl, a much rarer species
which breeds in these mountains but whose nest or eggs have yet to be
found here.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">During some winters the pine siskin, another
unpredictable finch, may be the most abundant species of bird in the
park. Flocks consisting of several hundred birds may frequent Newfound
Gap in late autumn or early winter, milling about in an exceptionally
restless manner and, all the while, uttering a distinctive unmusical
buzzing crescendo. There is some evidence that a few may nest in the
park, but more information is needed.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Of all the Canadian-zone birds in the park, none is
more plentiful or more likely to be encountered along the high-altitude
trails than the Carolina junco. This is the approachable, dark-gray
sparrow-size bird which you will find hopping about unconcernedly in the
parking areas at Newfound Gap and Clingmans Dome. When it flits away to
another feeding place, the white of the outer tail feathers shows
conspicuously. It resembles the slate-colored junco of New England and
Canada, but is larger, of a lighter and more uniform coloration, and has
a darker bill. In winter, when both the northern and the resident
subspecies are present in the park, they often occur in the same flock.
The song&#151;a cheery, bell-like, tinkling trill&#151;is much more
musical than that of the chipping sparrow or worm-eating warbler with
which it may be compared. The deeply cupped nest is built usually on the
ground below overhanging roots; observant hikers often find the
attractive nest when the close-sitting bird is flushed from the
trailside. The first eggs may be laid in late April, and it is not
unusual for a late snow to cover the ground close to the incubating
bird. A second set may be laid in July.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Early frost may be the signal which causes the
Carolina juncos to leave the dark coniferous forests of the higher
Appalachians and wing their way down to the foothills, usually in
October. Approximately 6 months later this migration is reversed. Here,
as elsewhere throughout the world where high mountains are features of
the landscape, certain birds have a vertical migration pattern.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">In addition to the Carolina junco, there are other
southern Appalachian breeding birds (subspecies) which are closely
related to, but not identical with, more northern forms. These include
the solitary vireo, brown creeper, winter wren, and black-throated blue
warbler. The red crossbills are in need of further study to determine
whether a resident population exists. The two breeding chickadees
represent distinct species (Carolina and black-capped).</P>

</TABLE>

<P ALIGN="justify">Wild turkeys, largest birds in the area, appear to be
holding their own. You must keep in mind that National Parks give
sanctuary to these birds and to all native forms of life (except fish).
The bobcats, foxes, and other predators are given the same protection
as those species on which they prey. Research has shown that
predation&#151;the act of one animal preying upon another&#151;has been
very much overrated in its effects upon animal populations. The cutting
of forests, the draining of swamps, the construction of endless miles of
highways, and various other man-caused changes to the landscape have had
infinitely more influence on the welfare of our wildlife than predation.
Also, the wild turkey populations in the National Park are probably
affected more by the climatic conditions which prevail during the early
life of the chicks, by diseases, and by the occasional failure of the
acorn crop than they are by the attacks of other animals.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Along with the croak of a raven, another sound
symbolic of wildness is the drumming of a ruffed grouse. This muffled
crescendo, resembling the noise of an engine in the far distance, is
made by the beating wings of the male while he perches on a log in the
forest. Most of the drumming is done in April and October. Is the male
proclaiming to other male grouse the fact that it is here that he has
staked out his territory? Or, as some observers believe, does the male
drum in order to attract the female's attention? Ruffed grouse are
fairly common in some parts of the park, and they may be encountered
from the lowest to the highest altitudes. Other birds whose
distribution in the park shows no regard for altitudes include the
robin, chimney swift, hairy woodpecker, bobwhite, ruby-throated
hummingbird, black-throated green warbler, catbird, and rufous-sided
towhee.</P>

</TABLE>

<P ALIGN="justify">There are water impoundments along the park's western
and southwestern boundaries, but within the area there are no permanent
lakes or ponds. Consequently water and shore birds ordinarily bypass
these mountains in their migrations. There have been instances, however,
when numbers of night-flying coots, ducks, and shore birds have been
grounded while snowstorms of late October and early November swirled
over the Smokies. Apparently mistaking the wet glistening road for a
watercourse, some of the birds, in trying to alight, were injured or
killed by the impact. The only record of a golden plover in the park
came during the first snow storm of the season, in late October
1953.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">All bird observers know that any region, if studied
long enough, is bound to have its list of rare or unexpected species.
The Great Smokies is no exception. According to park records, a listing
of the 10 rarest birds would include white pelican, common egret, brant,
snow goose, pigeon hawk, red phalarope, laughing gull, sooty tern,
red-cockaded woodpecker, and white-winged crossbill. Both the golden and
bald eagles are quite rare, especially the former. The practically
uninterrupted forest growth is unsuited to the golden eagle, whereas the
absence of large bodies of water accounts for the scarcity of the bald
eagle. The large reservoirs just outside the park have not, as yet,
affected the status of the bald eagle in this area. Peregrine falcons
nested on a prominent ridge near Alum Cave Bluffs for many years, but
since they deserted this site these splendid birds have been observed
rather infrequently.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Approximately 200 kinds of birds have been observed
within the borders of the park. If we were to add the birds which have
been reported from a narrow marginal band of land and water
(reservoirs) within a few miles of the park's boundary, the number would
approach 240. Permanent residents, such as robin, cardinal, and song
sparrow, total more than 60; those found here only during the breeding
season, such as chimney swift, wood thrush, and red-eyed vireo, total
approximately the same. At least 100 kinds of birds have been observed
in the park and immediate vicinity during the winter. Of that number, 90
percent have been seen by organized groups engaged in taking the annual
Christmas bird count (1935-57) sponsored by the National Audubon
Society. As many as 64 species have been observed in one day in the
winter. The spring migration, featured by a large variety of warblers,
is usually at its peak during the last days of April. Autumn migration
is often characterized by a heavy flight of Swainson's thrushes in late
September and early October.</P>
