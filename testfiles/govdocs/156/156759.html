            <h3>Monday, April 2 (7:00pm)</h3>
            <p class = "feature"> Jazz Film Series</p>
            <p><b> Cecil Taylor: All the Notes </b>(2003). Dir/Prod Christopher
              Felver. (73 min, DVD)<br>
                <br>
  This insightful portrait of the avant pianist, composer and poet Cecil Taylor
  finds the free-jazz firebrand playing piano, dancing, reciting, performing
  with a big band and talking about life, art, music and childhood memories.
            <hr size="1" noshade>
            <h3>Monday, April 9 (7:00pm)</h3>
            <p class = "feature"> Jazz Film Series</p>
            <p><b> Home </b>(2005). Dir/Prod Dorothy Darr. (72 min, DVD)<br>
                <br>
  Just two months before his death in 2001, drummer Billy Higgins visited saxophonist
  Charles Lloyd at his home where they recorded a series of duets eventually
  released as ‘Which Way Is East.’ The artist and film maker Dorothy Darr rolled
  both audio tape and video, revealing an intimate celebration of music and spiritual
  connection.

            <h3>Wednesday, April 11 (7:00pm)</h3>
            <p><b> Clash by Night </b>(Wald-Krasna/RKO, 1952). Dir Fritz Lang.
              Wrt Alfred Hayes, based on the play by Clifford Odets. With Barbara
              Stanwyck, Paul Douglas, Robert Ryan, Marilyn Monroe, J. Carrol
              Naish. (104 min, black & white, 35mm)<br>
                <br>
  Mae returns to her hometown after ten years in New York, seeking peace and
  security. But even in prosaic surroundings, her desires are hard to suppress,
  as she finds herself drawn to two powerful men. This is not the stuff of romance,
  but of juicy melodrama, and director Fritz Lang is a master at creating emotional
  fireworks. Barbara Stanwyck, playing a hard-bitten woman of a certain age,
  gives one of her most incisive later portrayals. Robert Ryan is a charismatic
  anti-hero, and a young Marilyn Monroe lights up the screen in a supporting
  role.

  Gigolo Jim Preston, disenchanted during the anniversary of his marriage to
  his wealthy, older, alcoholic, shrill of a wife, Ellen, concocts a plan to
  rid the planet of her presence and enjoy the breadth of her fortune with many
  a young plaything. In his plight, Jim calls upon his seemingly normal friend
  Mike to drop the axe. Unbeknownst to Jim, Mike is a heroin-addicted psychopath
  with hobbies that include kidnaping, rape, addicting others to heroin, storing
  live people in coffins, etc. and is considering taking up necrophilia. Mike
  also happens to be the serial killer at the center of a citywide police investigation.
  A crumbling grip on reality does not stop Mike from being hesitant towards
  Jim's plan and suspecting that Jim will exterminate him as soon as the assignment
  is complete. Mike, however, finds a doppelganger of Ellen and kills her instead,
  confusing Jim, Ellen, the police, the doppelganger, one of Jim's playthings,
  and even himself. Ellen, on the other hand, has diabolical plans of her own…<br>
  <br>
  Greek exploitation films are near impossible to find in English speaking countries.
  To see one in the theatre is un-imaginable! This rare experience is loaded
  with enough over the top melodrama, violence, male bravado, conspiracies, plot-twists,
  moral-decay, and naked flesh to satisfy almost all mammalian instincts!

            <p><b> Barfly </b>(Cannon, 1987). Dir Barbet Schroeder. Wrt Charles

                <br>
  Charles Bukowski’s alter ego Harry Chinaski (Rourke) spends his days and nights
  in watering holes around Los Angeles, Bukowski’s home throughout most of his
  life. He meets a fellow drunk, Wanda (Dunaway), and they begin a sloshed affair,
  while a wealthy publisher (Krige) pursues Chinaski in attempt to make him a
  successful, sober, clean-cut American writer. Schroeder shot the film in actual
  Los Angeles bars, as well as a supposed former apartment of Bukowski. The film
  features Bukowski’s trademark philosophical wit in unforgettable quotes, as
  well as a cameo by the author/poet.

            <h3>Friday, April 20 (7:00pm)</h3>
            <p class = "feature"> Screening Shakespeare: Silent Shakespeare -
              Part 1</p>
            (live piano accompaniment by Ray Brubacher) <br>
            <em>Screening introduced by Dr Judith Buchanan, Film Studies, Department
            of English and Related Literature, The University of York, United
            Kingdom.</em><br>
<br>
The absence of the spoken word did not prevent silent cinema from producing more
than 300 screen adaptations of the Bard’s work, mostly before Word War I when
film was still struggling for recognition against unfavorable comparisons with
traditional forms of performing arts. Tonight and next Tuesday we present a small
sampling of the riches that are silent Shakespeare.<br>
<br>
<b>Duel Scene from "Macbeth" </b>(American Mutoscope & Biograph Co., 1905). Camera
G. W. Bitzer. (40 sec, black & white, 16mm)<br>
<br>
<b>Taming of the Shrew </b>(American Mutoscope & Biograph Co., 1908). Dir D.
W. Griffith. With Florence Lawrence (Kate), Harry Solter (Father), Linda Arvidson
(Bianca). (11 min, black & white, 16mm)<br>
<br>
<b>La Mégère Apprivoisée = Taming of a Shrew </b>(Eclipse, France, 1911). Dir
Henri Desfontaines. With Romuald Joubé (Petruchio), André Bacqué (Baptista),
Roger Lion (Lucentio), Madeleine Barjac (Katherine), Cécile Didier (Bianca).
(11 min, black & white, 35mm)<br>
<br>
We begin the evening with three men in kilts dueling in front of a painted backdrop,
one of the earliest screen depictions of Shakespeare’s work.<br>
<br>
<b>Taming of the Shrew </b>, also produced by Biograph and D. W. Griffith's only
adaptation of Shakespeare, is a knockabout farce with Florence Lawrence's Kate
being tamed by an unidentified Petruchio (sometimes misidentified as actor Arthur
Johnson). The action takes place on four different studio sets (including a kitchen!),
without much effort to convey the ambiance of the original, and ends with an
incongruous pastoral exterior shot. Mack Sennett appears as one of Petruchio's
servants.<br>
<br>
Unlike Griffith’s broad comedy, the version produced three years later by the
French company Eclipse is much closer to the play, both in its sets and performances,
the latter by stars of the famed Odéon theatre in Paris.<br>
<br>
<b>Macbeth </b>(Cines, Italy, 1909). Dir. Mario Caserini. With Dante Capelli
(Macbeth), Maria Caserini Gasperini (Lady Macbeth). (16 min, black & white, 35mm)<br>
<br>
<b>Otello = Othello </b>(Film d’Arte Italiana, Italy, 1909). Dir Gerolamo Lo
Savio. With Ferruccio Garavaglia, (Othello), Cesare Dondini (Iago), Vittoria
Lepanto (Desdemona), Alberto Nepoti (Cassio), A. Pezzaglia (The Doge). (11 min,
black & white, 35mm)<br>
<br>
As is the case with most Italian silent renderings of Shakespeare, director Mario
Caserini (working here with his wife, actress Maria Gasperini), presents <b>Macbeth </b> as
a historical spectacle, with elaborate sets, backgrounds and crowd scenes. Interestingly,
the film limits Macbeth’s second encounter with the witches to their warning
about Macduff, thereby eliminating the trademark scene of Birnam Wood coming
to Dunsinane.<br>
<br>
<b>Othello</b> was the first production of the Italian offshoot of the "art film" movement,
inaugurated in France in 1907 when Charles Pathé established the Film d’Art company
with the goal of producing screen adaptations of classic novels and plays with
stars of the theater both in front and behind the camera. The film is particularly
interesting for its authentic settings as it was shot on location in Venice,
where "imposing facades, beautiful colonnades, magnificent porticos and marvelously
wrought gateways, all come under our view as we pass from one scene to another
of this great play." (Moving Picture World)<br>
<br>
<b>The Winter’s Tale </b>(Thanhouser, 1910). Dir Barry O’Neil (?). Adapt Lloyd
F. Lonergan, Gertrude Thanhouser. With Anna Rosemond (Queen of Sicilia), Martin
Faust (King of Sicilia), Frank H. Crane (King of Bohemia), Amelia Barleon (Princess
of Sicilia), Alfred Hanlon (Prince of Bohemia). (10 min, black & white, 35mm)<br>
<br>
With his extensive theatrical background, Edwin Thanhouser was well positioned
to tackle the Bard’s work on screen when he organized his film company in 1909. <b>The
Winter’s Tale </b> was the first in what was announced as "a strong series of
Shakespearean releases" (<em>Romeo and Juliet</em> and <em>The Tempest</em> followed
in 1911), and the first film adaptation of Shakespeare to publicly announce the
name of the actors. The work won high praise from contemporary reviewers, with
Moving Picture World claiming that "we have never seen better acting in any motion
picture that has come before our eyes." The existing copy lacks the ending in
which the King of Sicilia is reunited with his Queen who has been made up to
resemble a statue.<br>
<br>
<b>Desdemona </b>(Nordisk, Denmark, 1911). Dir August Blom. Wrt Louis Møller.
With Valdemar Psilander (Ejnar/Othello), Thyra Reimann (Maria/Desdemona), Nicolai
Brechling (Preben/Iago), Henry Knudsen (Count Brisson). (17 min, black & white,
16mm)<br>
<br>
Produced at the peak of the golden age of Danish cinema by the Nordisk company,
which released its films in the U.S. under the Great Northern banner, <b>Desdemona </b> is
an early example of transposing Shakespeare’s work into a modern setting by building
a story around a performance of the original play. In this context, the "real
life" characters are usually a reflection of the roles they interpret on stage,
a formula used to good effect in later works such as George Cukor’s <em>A Double
Life</em> (1948) and Cole Porter’s musical <em>Kiss Me Kate</em>.<br>
<br>
<b>Twelfth Night </b>(Vitagraph, 1910). Dir Charles Kent (?). With Florence Turner
(Viola), Edith Storey (Sebastian), Julia Swayne Gordon (Olivia), Tefft Johnson
(Orsino), Charles Kent (Malvolio). (9 min, black & white, 35mm)<br>
<br>
<b>As You Like It </b>(Vitagraph, 1912). Dir Charles Kent. Adapt Margaret Birch.
With Rose Coghlan (Rosalind), Maurice Costello (Orlando), Rosemary Theby (Celia),
Robert Gaillord (Oliver), Rose Tapley (Phoebe). (29 min, black & white, 35mm)<br>
<br>
Renowned for the high quality of its releases, the Vitagraph Co. of America produced
a number of Shakespeare adaptations, beginning with <em>Macbeth</em> in 1908
and represented here with two popular cross-dressing comedies, <b>Twelfth Night </b>and <b>As
You Like It </b>. The first is a rather confusing condensation of the play, not
helped by the lack of intertitles in the Library’s print. Pictorially, however,
it is a well made film, and the acting by Vitagraph’s stock company is more than
adequate, with Charles Kent excellent as the pompous steward Malvolio. <b>As
You Like It </b>, on the other hand, marked the first time the company extended
the length of its Shakespeare releases to three reels and imported a famous star
of the theater to play the lead. Rose Coghlan, who appeared on stage as Rosalind
back in 1880, was by then 61 years old, and "no amount of make-up or corseting
could hide the lines in her face or the dumpiness of her figure" (Robert Hamilton
Ball). The rest of the cast, including Vitagraph’s top male star of the time,
Maurice Costello, fared better, as did the attractive exteriors (Flatbush, NY,
standing in for the Forest of Arden).

<h3>Monday, April 23 (7:00pm)</h3>
<p class = "feature"> Jazz Film Series</p>
<p><b> Los Zafiros: Music From the Edge of Time </b>(2004). Dir/Prod Lorenzo
  deStefano. (79 min, DVD)<br>
    <br>
  Music, emotion and rarely seen archival film clips from Cuban television fuel
  this bittersweet, award-winning tribute to the beloved vocal group Los Zafiros
  (The Saffires), known as the Beatles of 1960s Cuba. Thirty years after their
  breakup, the two surviving band members, Manuel Galban and Miguel Cancio, reunite
  in Havana sharing songs, celebrations, memories and tears.

<h3>Tuesday, April 24 (7:00pm)</h3>
<p class = "feature"> Screening Shakespeare: Silent Shakespeare - Part 2</p>
(live piano accompaniment by Ray Brubacher)<br>
<br>
<p><b> Marcantonio e Cleopatra = Antony and Cleopatra </b>(Cines, Italy, 1913).
  Dir Enrico Guazzoni. Wrt Guazzoni. With Giovanna Terribili Gonzales (Cleopatra),
  Amleto Novelli (Marc Antony), Ignazio Lupi (Octavius), Elsa Lenard (Octavia),
  Matilde Di Marzio (Charmian). (62 min, black & white, 16mm)<br>
    <br>
  preceded by:<br>
  <br>
  <b>Shylock, ou le More de Venise = The Merchant of Venice </b>(Eclipse, France,
  1913). Dir Henri Desfontaines. With Harry Baur (Shylock), Jean Hervé (Bassanio),
  Pépa Bonafé (Portia), Romuald Joubé (Antonio). (32 min, black & white, 16mm)<br>
  <br>
  Notwithstanding the references to Shakespeare in both modern sources and advertisements
  accompanying the film’s original release in the U.S. and U.K., <b>Antony and
  Cleopatra </b>owes more to its other two literary sources, Pietro Cossa’s dramatic
  poem ‘Cleopatra’ and, in particular, Plutarch’s series of biographies and character
  studies ‘Lives of the Noble Grecians and Romans.’ Directed by Enrico Guazzoni
  following the extraordinary worldwide success of his epic <em>Quo Vadis?</em> (1913),
  the film was highly praised for its lavish costumes, elaborate special effects,
  and massive sets, including a giant replica of Cleopatra's barge "of sufficiently
  ample proportions to prevent its sinking under the weight of a Giovanna Terribili
  Gonzales' well fed Cleopatra" (Kenneth S. Rothwell).<br>
  <br>
  Preceded by the last in a series of Shakespeare films produced by Eclipse.
  Earlier titles include <em>Henry IV</em> in 1909 and <em>Hamlet</em> in 1910,
  both now lost, as well as <em>The Taming of the Shrew</em> in 1911 (see April
  20).

<p class = "feature"> Screening Shakespeare</p>
(introduced by Christel Schmidt)<br>
<br>
<p><b> Taming of the Shrew </b>(Pickford Corp.-Elton Corp./United Artists, 1929).
  Dir Sam Taylor. Adapt Taylor. With Mary Pickford (Katherine), Douglas Fairbanks
  (Petruchio), Edwin Maxwell (Baptista), Joseph Cawthorn (Gremio), Clyde Cook
  (Grumio). (68 min, black & white, 35mm)<br>
    <br>
  preceded by:<br>
  <br>
  <b>Hamlet and Eggs </b>(Educational/Twentieth Century-Fox, 1937). Dir William
  Watson. Story Tim Ryan. With Ryan, Irene Noblette, Frank Jaquet, Douglas Leavitt,
  Pat Patterson's Cowboy Trio. (16 min, black & white, 35mm)<br>
  <br>
  The first Shakespeare talkie was produced by two superstars of the silent era
  who both found the transition to sound to be a career-ending experience. Pickford
  and Fairbanks never worked together before, and the production, somewhat mirroring
  the state of their marriage, was plagued by a host of problems. Pickford complained
  that "Fairbanks read Shakespeare from a blackboard" and expressed annoyance
  with his on-set pranks. On screen, she certainly seems to be throwing punches
  and various objects at her husband with the utmost conviction.<br>
  <br>
  The film was simultaneously released in both sound and silent versions. As
  Pickford's second talking feature, it did well at the box office, nearly doubling
  its negative cost. In the mid-1960's, in conjunction with Franco Zeffirelli's
  screen adaptation of the play, Matty Kemp, then director of the Pickford Company,
  decided to reissue the 1929 version. The original film was shortened by five
  minutes and a new music track and sound effects were added. Released in 1966,
  this is the version we are presenting tonight.<br>
  <br>
  Preceded by a comedy short about a Shakespearean actor who, while vacationing
  in Arizona, is forced at gunpoint to appear in a production of ‘Romeo and Juliet.’

<p class = "feature"> Screening Shakespeare</p>
<p><b> A Midsummer Night’s Dream </b>(Warner Bros., 1935). Dir Max Reinhardt,
  William Dieterle. Adapt Charles Kenyon, Mary C. McCall, Jr. With Ian Hunter
  (Theseus), Verree Teasdale (Hippolyta), Hobart Cavanaugh (Philostrate), Dick
  Powell (Lysander), Ross Alexander (Demetrius), Olivia De Havilland (Hermia),
  Jean Muir (Helena), James Cagney (Bottom), Victor Jory (Oberon), Anita Louise
  (Titania), Mickey Rooney (Puck). (132 min, black & white, 35mm)<br>
    <br>
  Finding refuge in Hollywood after leaving Hitler’s Germany in 1934, Max Reinhardt,
  who already staged ‘A Midsummer Night’s Dream’ ten times in Europe, embarked
  on yet another production of the play, an open-air extravaganza at the Hollywood
  Bowl. With a nightly attendance of 15,000 spectators and highly praised by
  the critics, the show inevitably came to the attention of the resident film
  industry, and Warner Bros. hired the director to make a big-budget, star-studded
  screen version of Shakespeare’s classic.<br>
  <br>
  The end result is a mixed affair, with Reinhardt’s Expressionistic touches
  often clashing with the demands and cliches of Hollywood filmmaking. The critical
  response at the time was as varied, ranging from "Unquestionably the loveliest
  fantastic imagery the screen has yet produced" (Variety) to "Poor old Shakespeare!" (The
  Sunday Times), representing the extremely negative opinion of the film in the
  British press). <b>A Midsummer Night’s Dream </b>performed poorly at the box-office,
  convincing Hollywood to stay away from future adaptations of Shakespeare’s
  work (MGM’s <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> was by then already in production). With
  the 1953 <em>Julius Caesar</em> as the sole exception, this attitude prevailed
  until the success of Kenneth Branagh’s <em>Henry V</em> (1989).<br>

<p><b> Romeo and Juliet </b>(MGM, 1936). Dir George Cukor. Adapt Talbot Jennings.
  With Norma Shearer (Juliet), Leslie Howard (Romeo), John Barrymore (Mercutio),
  Edna May Oliver (Nurse to Juliet), Basil Rathbone (Tybalt), C. Aubrey Smith
  (Lord Capulet). (125 min, black & white, 35mm)<br>
    <br>
  With Irving G. Thalberg announcing the project as "a cultural undertaking of
  importance," MGM spared no cost in bringing Shakespeare’s tragedy to the screen.
  The studio’s research department spent two years gathering background material
  for the film, even dispatching a technical crew to Italy to photograph parts
  of the city of Verona, which were then reconstructed on MGM’s backlot. Cornell
  University professor William Strunk, Jr. was hired as a "Literary Consultant" to
  ensure that "no injustice was done" to Shakespeare, and the script did not
  include a single line of dialogue not written by the Bard. While Norma Shearer
  (Thalberg’s wife) was cast as Julia from the very beginning, among the actors
  considered for the part of Romeo were Robert Montgomery, Brian Aherne, Clark
  Gable, Robert Donat, Laurence Olivier, Franchot Tone and Robert Taylor.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Romeo and Juliet’s </b>opulent production values did not translate into
  box-office or critical success, and the film has won few admirers over the
  years. Kenneth Rothwell calls it "a masterwork from antiquity: a bit archaic,
  a little rigid, slightly overdone, but, yes, still withal warm and good." In
  1954, Paul Dehn was particularly impressed by John Barrymore and Basil Rathbone
  ("the best Mercutio and the best Tybalt I ever saw"), with Barrymore being
  praised as "‘Ham’ possibly - but how exquisitely cured!" <br>

    <br>
  Loosely based on Shakespeare's ‘Richard III,’ but also borrowing from all three
  parts of ‘Henry VI,’ <b>Tower of London </b>is a curious mixture of history,
  classic tragedy, and horror. Stylishly directed by Rowland V. Lee, whose <em>Son
  of Frankenstein</em> was released earlier that same year, the film features
  wonderfully sinister performances by Basil Rathbone as Richard, Duke of Gloucester,
  and Boris Karloff as his bald, club-footed executioner Mord. The role of the
  Duke of Clarence was played by the 28-year-old Vincent Price, who would later
  take over the lead in Roger Corman's 1962 remake.<br>

  <b>The Fabulous Stains--Behind the Movie </b>(1999). By Sarah Jacobson and

  <br>
  One of Hollywood's few forays into punk cinema, <b>The Fabulous Stains </b>was
  shelved by Paramount after disastrous previews. Considered too repellent for
  release, it however gained a cult following via cable in the mid ‘80's. Hailed
  by one writer as a "teen trash classic," this vitriolic satire/drama is about
  the rise and fall of an all-girl punk band. Stuck in a dead-end Pennsylvania
  town, 16 year old Corinne (Diane Lane) takes inspiration from touring British
  band The Looters (Ray Winstone and members of The Sex Pistols and The Clash)
  and forms The Stains. Despite its flaws and contrivances, <b>The Fabulous Stains </b>is
  a must-see document of the early ’80's. Washington, DC theatrical premiere.<br>
  <br>
  Preceded by <b>The Fabulous Stains--Behind the Movie </b>, an "excavation of
  an early-80s rock movie almost lost to obscurity" (Sam Green), which revisits
  the history of a "clumsy, cursed Hollywood effort [...] to capitalize on the
  rising visibility of girl power in the punk movement." The short documentary
  features interviews with several principles, including Lou Adler, Fee Waybill,
  and scriptwriter Nancy Dowd (who wrote <em>Slap Shot</em>).<br>

  Lupe Velez, Ginny Simms, May Robson, Patsy Kelly. (96 min, black & white, 16mm)<br>
    <br>
  This meeting of high art and pop culture has the temerity to team legendary
  thespian John Barrymore and bandleader Kay Kyser. Their swingin’ Shakespearean
  collaboration will please both hepcats and squares, providing Kyser can work
  in a few musical numbers and the highbrows don’t mind their verse spoken in
  a honeyed Southern drawl. Barrymore, not to be upstaged, indulges in merciless–and
  uproarious--self-parody in what turned out to be his cinematic swan song.<br>

<p class = "feature"> Screening Shakespeare</p>
<p><b> Henry V </b>(Two Cities Films, U.K., 1944). Dir Laurence Olivier. Adapt
  Alan Dent. With Olivier (Henry V), Robert Newton (Ancient Pistol), Leslie Banks
  (Chorus), Renée Asherson (Princess Katherine), Esmond Knight (Fluellen), Robert
  Helpmann (Bishop of Ely). (137 min, Technicolor, 35mm)<br>
    <br>
  Buoyant, fanciful version of <b>Henry V </b>chronicles the English king as
  he overcomes tremendous odds by leading his men to a glorious victory on the
  battlefields of France. Olivier proves equally assured in both directorial
  and acting capacities, and the film remains a landmark in the history of British
  cinema. The vibrant Technicolor photography, splendid sets, rendered in one-point-perspective
  to evoke medieval manuscript illumination, and a stirring score by William
  Walton combine to create an exuberant fairytale ambiance. As the on-screen
  dedication to the commandos and airborne troops of Great Britain testifies,
  the film is overtly propagandistic. With many of the darker nuances of the
  play excised, the film served as a wholly affirmative wartime rallying cry
  by delivering a heartening reminder of an historic British victory in Europe
  to WWII audiences. After the film was released in the United States in 1946,
  Olivier won an honorary Academy Award "for his outstanding achievement as actor,
  producer and director in bringing ‘Henry V’ to the screen."<br>

    <br>
  A college student receives a letter from his deceased father instructing him
  to guard his young and naive mother from unscrupulous men. Yes, it’s ‘Hamlet,’ re-imagined

  Dougnac, Jean-Claude Dreyfus, Karin Viard, Ticky Holgado. (96 min, color, 35mm)<br>
    <br>
  A black-comedy set in post-apocalyptic France (maybe in the past, maybe in
  the future) where food is rare but meat is even more scarce. The film takes
  place almost entirely in a decrepit apartment building with a street-level
  butcher shop where the Butcher (Dreyfus) is also the Landlord and has forced
  his tenants into cannibalism. Louison (Pinon), a former circus clown who had
  a chimp for a comedic partner, answers a ‘help wanted’ ad to be the building's
  handyman. A wrench is thrown into the Butcher's plans to serve the clown as
  the next meal when Louison falls in love with his daughter. Together, they
  must escape the Butcher with the help of an underground vegetarian terrorist
  organization--The Troglodists. The odd ensemble of characters are a treat and
  the tightly edited sequences of sound and rhythm are breathtaking.<br>

    <br>
  The first performance ever presented on the Elizabethan stage of the Folger
  Shakespeare Library in Washington D.C. is also the earliest TV broadcast of
  Shakespeare’s work held by the Library of Congress. Transmitted nationally
  by NBC on a Sunday afternoon, the event was sponsored by the Socony-Vacuum
  Oil Company and performed by members of the dramatic society of Amherst College
  (The Masquers), which originally presented the play in March, 1949, at Amherst's
  Kirby Memorial Theater (the production was staged by Professor Curtis Canfield).<br>
  <br>
  Appropriately for the venue, the performance was presented "in the fashion
  of Shakespeare's time, just as people saw it when ‘Julius Caesar’ was a new
  and unknown play" (opening commentary). The broadcast profiles the Folger Library
  and its founder, Henry Clay Folger, an Amherst graduate and later president
  of Standard Oil, and includes appearances by Charles W. Cole, President of
  Amherst College (1946-1960), and Louis B. Wright, Folger’s Director from 1948

<p><b> Hallmark Hall of Fame. Hamlet </b>(NBC, 4/26/1953). Dir Albert McCleery.
  Adapt Mildred Freed Alberg, Tom Hughes Sand. With Maurice Evans (Hamlet), Ruth
  Chatterton (Queen Gertrude), Joseph Schildkraut (King Claudius), Sarah Churchill
  (Ophelia), Barry Jones (Polonius). (120 min, black & white, U-matic video)<br>
    <br>
  A landmark production, NBC's <b>Hamlet </b>was at the time the longest drama
  ever presented on American TV and the first TV adaptation of Shakespeare to
  feature Maurice Evans. Appearing on Broadway in ‘Romeo and Juliet’ (1936), ‘Richard
  II’ (1937), ‘Hamlet’ (1938) ‘Henry IV, Part I’ (1939), ‘Twelfth Night’ (1940)
  and ‘Macbeth’ (1941), the English-born actor became one of the world's best
  known interpreters of Shakespeare. A U.S. citizen from 1941, Evans toured the
  Pacific during World War II with the shortened "G.I." version of Hamlet, later
  staged on Broadway by George Schaefer. Supervised by Schaefer himself, the
  Hallmark telecast was unveiled on NBC on April 26, the date of William Shakespeare’s
  baptism in 1564.<br>
  <br>
  Evans's ornate and declamatory acting style might be considered dated by today's
  standards, and he was certainly too old for the part (52 at the time of the
  broadcast), but his presence, movement and eloquence stand up well. The production
  also benefits from creative camerawork and sets, although the latter have been
  criticized for trying to attain the "measure of illusion that movie sets afford" (Bernice
  W. Kliman). As to his TV debut, Evans was somewhat prophetic: "TV? Any 6-year-old
  in the living room can obliterate actor and play with a flick of the wrist
  and go on to more tonic pursuits."<br>

  Kerr (Portia). (121 min, black & white, 35mm)<br>
    <br>
  Solid, handsomely mounted production thought by many to be the most successful
  Hollywood adaptation of a Shakespeare play. Mankiewicz wisely opted for intimacy
  over spectacle, obtaining full value from the talents of the exemplary cast.
  Brando’s Antony surprised contemporary critics who were fearful that his method
  slurring and mumbling would compromise the poetic flow of the language, but
  the anxieties proved unjustified as his performance is both eloquent and vivid,
  purportedly benefitting from coaching by Gielgud. Exploiting sets used previously
  in MGM’s roman epic <em>Quo Vadis</em>?, Mankiewicz insisted on filming in
  black and white and, to preserve some of the energy of the play’s stage origins,
  on shooting scenes in chronological order.<br>

    <br>
  Cole Porter’s witty musical, which premiered on Broadway in 1948, successfully
  transposes Shakespeare’s ‘The Taming of the Shrew’ into the modern era while
  at the same time preserving the original text in its "onstage" portions. Though
  the film adaptation takes all of the songs from the stage production (with
  the addition of ‘From This Moment On, ‘ originally written for another Porter
  musical), it includes numerous alterations to the Broadway version’s often
  suggestive lyrics - e.g. a reference to the Kinsey Report on sexual behavior
  in the song ‘Too Darn Hot’ is changed to "the latest report." <b>Kiss Me Kate </b>was
  originally released in 3-D, although Dore Schary, MGM’s head of production,
  considered the technology "a freak entertainment... marked for extinction."<br>

  <br>
  Underwritten by The Ford Foundation and hosted by Alistair Cooke, the cultural
  anthology series <em>Omnibus</em> presented a wide variety of programs every
  Sunday afternoon, from classic plays and operas to current affairs documentaries.
  Each program usually contained several segments of varying lengths, although
  occasionally an episode would be devoted entirely to a single work.<br>
  <br>
  The 1953 production of <b>King Lear </b>was an ambitious endeavour: director
  Peter Brook was brought over from London, Pulitzer-Prize-winning composer Virgil
  Thomson wrote the original score, and Orson Welles made his U.S. TV debut in
  the title role. With Brook having reduced the play to 73 minutes by eliminating
  subplots secondary to the king's downfall and madness, CBS opted not to interrupt
  the program with commercial breaks. The grueling work that went into these
  live broadcasts is clearly visible on the director's tired and unshaven face
  as he talks to Alistair Cook following the play's finale. Welles, based in
  Ireland at the time, was saddled with a significant tax debt so that a deal
  had to be negotiated with the U.S. government allowing him to come to New York
  to work on the show. Observing the rehearsal, the NY Times noted that not once
  did the actor, "famous on two continents for more self-esteem than humbleness,
  lose his temper or threaten to have anyone ejected from the hall." The telecast
  is of particular interest today for coming closest to illustrating what Welles's
  theatrical performances of Shakespeare must have looked like. Welles returned
  to the role of King Lear on the stage of New York's non-profit City Center
  in January 1956, and was about to secure financing for a motion picture adaptation
  of the play at the time of his death in 1985.<br>

    <br>
  Two condensed versions of Shakespeare plays from the glory days of live television,
  both part of the prestigious and long-running (1947-58) drama series underwritten
  by the Kraft Foods company.<br>
  <br>
  The title role in <b>Macbeth </b>is played by E. G. Marshall, a prolific film
  and TV character actor probably best remembered as one of the <em>12 Angry
  Men</em> in the 1957 movie with Henry Fonda, while Lady Macbeth is portrayed
  by the renowned stage actress and acting instructor Uta Hagen. The NBC broadcast
  competed for an audience with <em>What’s My Line?</em>, horse races in Yonkers,
  and a wrestling match, all of which were transmitted at the same time by other
  stations.<br>
  <br>
  Despite promoting itself as a showcase for established Broadway talent, the
  Kraft series did not shy away from hiring unknowns for some rather meaty parts,
  as examplefied by the 1954 broadcast of <b>Romeo and Juliet </b>. 16-year-old
  Susan Strasberg starred as Juliet a year before her Broadway breakthrough in ‘The
  Diary of Anne Frank,’ while Liam Sullivan had only a few TV acting credits
  to his name when he tackled the role of Romeo. Sullivan went on to become one
  of the hardest working actors in television, appearing in everything from <em>Twilight
  Zone</em> and <em>Perry Mason</em> to <em>Dynasty</em> and <em>Falcon Crest</em>.
  The hour-long digest of the play (including the obligatory cheese commercials),
  was not treated kindly by Variety, which likened the romance to "a juve flirtation
  in an icecream parlor", and accused Sullivan of paying "more attention to showcasing
  his dentures than making the part of Romeo believable."<br>

<p><b> Romeo and Juliet </b>(Universalcine-Verona Productions, Italy/U.K., 1954).
  Dir & Adapt Renato Castellani. With Laurence Harvey (Romeo), Susan Shentall
  (Juliet), Flora Robson (The Nurse), Mervyn Johns (Friar Laurence), Bill Travers
  (Benvolio), Enzo Fiermonte (Tybalt), Sebastian Cabot (Capulet). (138 min, Technicolor,
  35mm)<br>
    <br>
  Described as an "interesting and ambitious, if not wholly successful, experiment" (Monthly
  Film Bulletin), this version of the tragic love story boldly combines Shakespeare
  with elements of Italian neorealism by emphasizing the naturalistic visuals
  over the spoken word. The project took three years to complete, with the bulk
  of the seven-month shoot spent on various locations chosen for their authentic
  Renaissance architecture, from Verona and Venice to the small Tuscan town of
  San Quirico d'Orcia. With British cinematographer Robert Krasker (Olivier's <em>Henry
  V, The Third Man</em>) behind the camera, and surrealist painter Leonor Fini
  responsible for the costumes, the film is certainly one of the most visually
  sumptuous screen adaptations of the Bard's works.<br>
  <br>
  While the role of Romeo went to Laurence Harvey, a rising star of the Royal
  Shakespeare Company, Juliet was played by a 19-year-old secretarial college
  student from Derbyshire, England, who never appeared in another film. In keeping
  with the latter choice, director Castellani also peppered the supporting cast
  with non-professionals, including novelist Elio Vittorini (appearing under
  the alias of Giovanni Rota) in the role of the Prince of Verona, and a Veronese
  architect, Ubaldo Zollo, in the much truncated role of Mercutio. The film won
  the top prize at the 1954 Venice Film Festival.<br>

  Returning to television less than a year after <em>Hamlet</em>, Maurice Evans
  recreated his greatest stage success with Hallmark's <b>Richard II </b>. The
  telecast begins with documentary footage of Queen Elizabeth II's coronation
  (June 2, 1953), which is followed by the play’s opening scene of the banishment
  of Mowbray and Bolingbroke staged in a cathedral-like gothic interior, the
  first in a series of impressive sets designed for the show by Richard Sylbert
  and built in NBC's new Brooklyn studio (a major portion of the $175,000 production
  cost was spent on the 2,500 work hours needed for set construction). Sylbert
  went on to become one of Hollywood's top production designers and was responsible
  for such films as <em>The Manchurian Candidate</em> (1962), <em>Chinatown</em> (1974),
  and <em>Reds</em> (1981).<br>
  <br>
  Echoing opinions of other early TV adaptations of Shakespeare, <b>Richard II </b>was
  criticized both in contemporary reviews and later assessments for its elaborate
  art direction ("too cluttered" was a common complaint), representing a prevalent
  view that physical spectacle and pageantry take the focus away from the characters
  and the spoken word, and are usually incompatible with the TV medium "where
  the proscenium arch is only twenty-one inches" (New York Times). On the other
  hand, the reviewers praised the clarity of the condensed script and especially
  Evans's performance, which Time magazine described as a brilliant portrayal
  of "a posturing, unsettled man, forever wavering between false triumph and
  real despair." Maurice Evans appeared in five additional TV adaptations of
  Shakespeare: twice in the title role of <em>Macbeth</em> (1954 and 1960), opposite
  Lilli Palmer in <em>The Taming of the Shrew</em> (1956), as Malvolio in <em>Twelfth
  Night</em> (1957), and with Richard Burton and Lee Remick in <em>The Tempest</em> (1960).
  Today, however, he is best remembered as Samantha's father, Maurice, on the
  sitcom <em>Bewitched</em>, and Dr. Zaius, the orangutan, in the 1968 film <em>Planet
  of the Apes</em>.<br>

  Countless motion pictures have been inspired by the story of Shakespeare's

  of the latter group, Anthony Asquith's rarely seen film (at least in the U.S.)
  puts a Cold War spin on the tale by having the daughter of a government official
  from an unspecified Communist state fall in love with a young American employed
  in the Intelligence Section of the U.S. Embassy in London.<br>
  <br>
  Producer Anthony Havelock-Allan (<em>Brief Encounter, Great Expectations</em>)
  envisioned the film "as a blast against McCarthyism," and wanted to hire an
  American director (Mark Robson) and star (James Stewart). Instead, the Rank
  Organisation brought in a veteran British filmmaker (Asquith) and a 26-year-old
  American making his screen debut (Knight). Havelock-Allan's desired "stark,
  realistic style the Americans were so good at" was thereby replaced by Asquith's
  trademark lyricism and powerful emotional images. As Raymond Durgnat observed,
  the two main characters are "Romeo and Juliet who cry 'A plague on both your
  houses,' elope, and find happiness in flight - or death?"<br>

"<b>Let the Good Times Roll </b>intercuts 1950's documentary footage with latter-day
performance clips. In 1973, Richard Nader brought together the greatest names
in ‘50s rock for a reunion show in front of an extremely supportive New York
audience (as Fred Parris of the Five Satins exclaims tearfully, ‘This is just
like 1956’). The results leaves the viewer stunned, drained, and speechless.
It’s Woodstock, only in reverse. Little Richard’s nervous demand that his piano
be moved forward (‘I have to get close to the PEOPLE!’), the Five Satins singing
blues backstage, Chuck Berry’s nostalgic walk around his tour bus, and Bo Diddley’s
metal mashing ‘Hey Bo Diddley,’ all makes this indispensable viewing. Brutally, <b>Let
the Good Times Roll </b>was released on top of <em>American Graffiti</em>, which
stole all thunder. But the people who knew, knew." – Art Fein, in "Hollywood

  Before <em>A Hard Day’s Night</em> and <em>Don’t Look Back</em>, there was <b>Lonely

  business power brokers and hear his manager explain his unique appeal.<br>

    <br>
  Laurence Olivier’s third attempt at directing Shakespeare on film chronicles
  Richard of Gloucester’s murderous efforts to steal the crown of England. Olivier’s
  iconic personification of Richard, partly modeled on notorious Broadway producer
  Jed Harris and Disney’s Big Bad Wolf, was highly praised at the time despite,
  or because of, its caricatured villainy. With false nose, jet black hair, hunched
  back and limp, Olivier cuts an imposing figure though his clipped, shrill delivery
  often rushes through the text and at times falls perilously close to subsequent
  parodies by the likes of Peter Sellers and Beyond the Fringe. Though somewhat
  upstaged by the central performance, the supporting cast is strong with Gielgud’s
  Clarence a highlight. Shot in VistaVision and vivid Technicolor, the film’s
  long takes and wide compositions make for a rigorously theatrical viewing experience.<br>

  Digital Betacam video)<br>
    <br>
  The first full-length TV production of ‘A Midsummer Night's Dream’ was a big-budget
  affair with a cast of twenty-two and a twenty-eight member ballet troupe. It
  was directed by Austrian-born Rudolph Cartier, who studied drama under Max
  Reinhardt and then worked as a script writer for the German filmmaking concern
  UFA. After the Nazis came to power, Cartier left Germany, and following a brief
  stint in the U.S. settled in England where he became BBC's top TV director,
  active in both dramatic programming (the <em>Quatermass</em> series, Orwell's <em>1984</em>)
  and opera (<em>Salome, Carmen</em>).<br>
  <br>
  <b>A Midsummer Night's Dream </b>won nothing but accolades at the time of its
  broadcast. James Thomas in The Daily Mirror commented that "the Cartier magic
  was at work again, building breadth and beauty out of the hysterical muddle
  which normally passes for spectacle on the small screen," and proving "to a
  worried BBC that Shakespeare needs only a master director to be box office,
  even in this medium of TV where so often the intelligence is underrated." In
  keeping with this sentiment, Philip Purser in The News Chronicle marveled how "Shakespeare
  always flows a little unexpectedly from the telly, as if the kitchen tap had
  suddenly started to gush a rather good claret."<br>

  Ustinov, based on his play. With Ustinov, Sandra Dee, John Gavin, Akim Tamiroff,
  Alix Talton, Rik von Nutter. (103 min, Technicolor, 35mm)<br>
    <br>
  Under pressure from the two superpowers over his deciding U.N. vote, the president
  of Europe's smallest country tries to remain neutral by orchestrating a romance
  between the offspring of the Russian and American ambassadors. The play, a "delicious
  piece of diplomatic fooling" (The Times), premiered in England in 1956 and
  then moved to Broadway in October 1957, marking Peter Ustinov’s American stage
  debut. Turning it into a motion picture, however, took several years to accomplish,
  primarily due to Ustinov's desire to maintain complete creative control over
  the project. According to the author, writing the screenplay involved altering
  the original work's whimsical approach to accommodate the realistic setting,
  as "comedy is merely another way to be serious," or quoting a line from the
  script, "politics are activities in which gravity mingles with the ludicrous
  in proportions which are not always happy."<br>
  <br>
  The production was based in Italy, in the Cinecittà studios in Rome and the
  Umbrian village of Todi, the latter doubling for the capital of mythical Concordia.
  In the title roles, teen idol Sandra Dee was paired with John Gavin, whose
  subsequent political career will include the appointment as U.S. ambassador
  to Mexico during the Reagan era. The two previously appeared in Douglas Sirk’s <em>Imitation
  of Life</em> (1959), and following Ustinov's film starred in <em>Tammy Tell
  Me True</em> (1961). The sets were designed by the prolific Alexandre Trauner
  (Orson Welles's <em>Othello, Rififi</em>), while Robert Krasker, the cinematographer
  on Castellani's <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> (see above), returns with another
  lavish Technicolor rendering of Italian locations.<br>

  (91 min, black & white, 35mm)<br>
    <br>
  A fascinating adaptation of ‘Othello’ set amidst the London jazz scene and
  tackling the racial politics of contemporary Britain, a theme that the producer/director
  team of Michael Relph and Basil Dearden were no strangers to (<em>Pool of London,
  Sapphire</em>). The title character of Shakespeare's play is assumed by black
  jazz pianist Aurelius Rex (Harris), whose marriage to a white singer (Stevens)
  is threatened by the scheming drummer Johnny Cousin (McGoohan). Disparaged
  at the time of its original release, the film has gained in stature over the
  years, in no small part due to Patrick McGoohan's superb take on Iago and the
  on-screen appearances of a host of jazz giants, including Dave Brubeck, John
  Dankworth, Charles Mingus, and Tubby Hayes. At the other side of the spectrum, "the
  nearly forty-year-old Attenborough's attempt at portraying a youthful finger-snapping
  hipster will never go down as one of his finest hours" (Michael Brooke).<br>

<p><b> Shakespeare Wallah </b>(Merchant-Ivory Productions, India, 1965). Dir
  James Ivory. Wrt Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, Ivory, from a story by Jhabvala. With
  Shashi Kapoor, Felicity Kendal, Madhur Jaffrey, Geoffrey Kendal, Laura Liddel,
  Utpal Dutt. (115 min, black & white, 35mm)<br>
    <br>
  Exquisitely immersed in the mood and atmosphere of India, <b>Shakespeare Wallah </b>has
  often been compared to the films of Satyajit Ray. The story, about a group
  of Shakespearean actors touring the country shortly after it had achieved independence,
  was inspired by the experiences of Geoffrey Kendal, the actor-manager of an
  English repertory company (billed as "Shakespeariana") which traveled through
  India following World War II. In the script by Ivory and Ruth Prawer Jhabvala,
  the troupe's experiences mirror the passing of the British Raj as the audiences
  turn away from Western classics to products of the indigenous culture, namely
  Indian films.<br>
  <br>
  The film was made on a shoestring budget, with the funds mostly originating
  from the sale of worldwide distribution rights to <em>The Householder</em>,
  James Ivory’s first feature as director, to Columbia Pictures. Kendal himself
  was cast in the lead, along with his wife Laura Liddel, and their two daughters
  Jennifer and Felicity. In keeping with the family-like nature of the project,
  the role of Indian playboy Sanju went to Shashi Kapoor, Jennifer Kendal's real-life
  husband. Once the final cut was ready, Ivory took it to Satyajit Ray and asked
  him to compose the musical score, which contributes greatly to the film’s dreamlike
  quality, as in Ray's own work. <b>Shakespeare Wallah </b>had its world premiere
  at the 1965 Berlin Film Festival, where Madhur Jaffrey, in the role of film
  star Manjula, won the Silver Bear for Best Actress.<br>

  The influence and presence of Shakespeare in popular TV entertainment has been
  largely ignored by both scholarly texts and general reference sources. Our
  two fun-filled evenings (see also July 19) will illustrate how the Bard's works
  are often ingeniously weaved into the narratives of situation comedies, generating
  humor by serving as pegs on which to hang the characters' aspirations, desires
  and sometimes delusions.<br>
  <br>
  The four titles showcased tonight need no introduction. First, Lucy mistakenly
  assumes that she will play Juliet opposite Orson Welles's Romeo at a benefit
  performance at Ricky's club. Next, Gilligan as Hamlet recites "To flee or not
  to flee, that is the question that I ask of me" when the castaways stage a
  musical version of the play to impress obnoxious Hollywood producer Harold
  Hecuba (Phil Silvers, who else). In <b>Lamont as Othello </b>, the first episode
  of <em>Sanford and Son</em>'s 3rd season, Lamont's rehearsal of the "choking
  scene" with his white drama teacher playing Desdemona causes all kinds of misunderstandings,
  illustrating why the series is considered controversial to this day. And finally,
  in <b>Happy Days </b>, Richie and friends, in need of new uniforms for their
  underachieving baseball team, recruit Fonzie to play Hamlet in the annual Shakespeare
  Festival organized by the local church.<br>

  The centerpiece of tonight's program represents the rich tradition of puppetry
  in Central Europe and the work of its best known film practitioner, Czech animator
  Jirí Trnka (1912-1969). The adaptation of Shakespeare's ‘A Midsummer Night's
  Dream’ was Trnka’s last feature and his most lavish one. A nearly wordless
  pantomime, it relied on movement, color and music to convey the magic of the
  original work. The English language version, prepared for the film's U.S. release,
  abandons the non-verbal approach by going back to the text of the play, adapted
  by writer Howard Sackler (The Great White Hope). In addition to Richard Burton
  as narrator (the film begins with his reading of Shakespeare's ‘Sonnet XV’),
  other prominent Shakespeareans were hired to provide voices, among them Barbara
  Jefford, of the Old Vic, Alec McCowen, of the Royal Shakespeare Company (seen
  in this series as Antipholus of Syracuse in BBC's <em>Comedy of Errors</em>),
  and Barbara Leigh-Hunt, who appeared in the 1954 Broadway revival of ‘A Midsummer
  Night's Dream.’<br>

    <br>
  We are particularly pleased to be able to present the long lost TV version
  of the legendary 1965 National Theatre production of ‘Much Ado About Nothing,’ a
  copy of which was uncovered earlier this year in the Library's PBS Collection.<br>
  <br>
  Staged by Franco Zeffirelli, the production, which premiered on February 16,
  1965, at London’s Old Vic, created a controversy with its modern Sicilian setting
  and the characters’ heavy Italian accents. The TV version, made under BBC's
  exclusive deal with the National Theatre, was taped on January 11, 1967, and
  broadcast on BBC-1 on February 5. It was not a straightforward recording of
  a stage performance, but rather a full-blown adaptation, with the cast spending
  three weeks in rehearsal and director Alan Cooke's cameras joining the action
  by moving around the set and engaging the actors in tight close-ups. The end
  result was exciting television, although Zeffirelli himself, upon seeing the
  preview, was "mighty miffed" (Variety) and asked that his name be removed from
  the credits. The "heavy Italianate manner" of the stage version was retained,
  as were other entertaining bits such as the living statues and a rowdy town
  band.<br>
  <br>
  Needless to say, the cast is superb. Real-life married couple Maggie Smith
  and Robert Stephens reprise their stage roles, while Derek Jacobi takes over
  from Albert Finney as Don Pedro (Jacobi played the villain, Don John, in the
  NT production), and Michael Byrne replaces Ian McKellen as Claudio. The music
  was composed by Nino Rota, Federico Fellini's regular collaborator, who will
  reunite with Zeffirelli on the 1968 screen adaptation of <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> (see
  below). The show was first broadcast in the U.S. in two parts on March 11 and

A befuddled, middle-aged, and humorless Tyrone Power, actually. Fortunately,

    <br>
  Opulent production of the early Shakespeare comedy concerning a boorish dowry
  hunter who meets his match when he agrees to marry the wild tempered, razor-tongued
  daughter of a wealthy Paduan merchant. Like the 1929 Pickford/Fairbanks version,
  Zeffirelli’s <b>Shrew </b>is employed as a celebrity vehicle for a famous Hollywood
  couple. Burton and Taylor’s much publicized tempestuous off-screen relationship
  grafts additional comic fodder onto the central protagonist’s battle of wills.
  Playing fast and loose with Shakespeare’s text, Zeffirelli characteristically "opens
  out" the play creating a frothy concoction of incidental visual detail and
  busy kinetic spectacle.<br>

  Laurence), Bruce Robinson (Benvolio). (139 min, Technicolor, 35mm)<br>
    <br>
  Commercially the most successful Shakespeare film of all time had its origins
  in Franco Zeffirelli's first staging of the Bard, the 1960 production of ‘Romeo
  and Juliet’ at the Old Vic. Following his highly praised screen adaptation
  of <em>The Taming of the Shrew</em>, the Italian director returned to ‘Romeo’ believing
  that the play could be made attractive to the rebellious youth of the late
  1960's. To that end, he hired two unknowns for the title roles, the 17-year-old
  Leonard Whiting and 15-year-old Olivia Hussey, and, following Renato Castellani's
  example (see May 31), shot the film on various locations in Italy, although
  not in Verona itself as the city by then looked too modern.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Romeo and Juliet </b>divided the critics, with the Bard purists pointing
  out the significant abridgement of Shakespeare's text and the poor delivery
  of the verses by the two leads, and the film reviewers praising the impressive
  visuals and Zeffirelli's flamboyant direction. The leads' age and good looks
  certainly resonated with contemporary audiences, and combined with a strong
  supporting cast (especially John McEnery as Mercutio) and the lavish production
  design, cinematography and Nino Rota's sensual music, helped propel the world-wide
  gross to an unprecedented $48 million. As an interesting footnote, Laurence
  Olivier, who delivers the Prologue, also provides the dubbing voice for Antonio
  Pierfederici (Lord Montague).<br>

    <br>
  Our first pre-Code feature, <b>The Kiss Before the Mirror</b>, offers a frank
  portrayal of adultery and revenge. A famous doctor stalks and kills his wife
  in a fit of jealousy. The criminal lawyer who defends him begins to suspect
  his own wife of infidelity as he draws comparisons between her and the slain
  woman. James Whale, the renowned director of <em>Frankenstein</em>, and other
  classics, does not refrain from adding a gothic touch before taking us to the
  courtroom. This early thriller is further distinguished by the photography
  of German cinematographer Karl Freund. Remade by James Whale as <em>Wives Under

  <br>
  Free love, nude modeling, and a hefty dose of social criticism targeting the
  upper class typify our next pre-Code feature, <b>The Common Law </b>. A kept
  woman abandons her luxurious lifestyle in order to be with the man she loves,
  a struggling artist. A tempestuous relationship ensues, complicated by interference
  from her former lover and the young man's family. Marital bliss results, but
  the message here is that a woman with a past can still "make good" without
  any "compensating values" - she won't be punished for her so-called transgressions.
  The Artists' Ball is an over-the-top fleshy spectacle full of remarkable costumes
  and sets.<br>

<p class = "feature"> Screening Shakespeare</p>
<p><b> The Winter’s Tale </b>(BBC, U.K., 4/20/1962). Dir Don Taylor. With Robert
  Shaw (Leontes), Rosalie Crutchley (Hermione), Sarah Badel (Perdita), Ron Moody
  (Autolycus), Brian Smith (Florizel), Alan Rowe (Cleomenes), Patrick Macnee
  (Polixenes), Geoffrey Bayldon (Antigonus), Brenda Bruce (Paulina), Frank Atkinson
  (Old Shepherd), Norman Rossington (Young Shepherd). (144 min, black & white,
  Digital Betacam video)<br>
    <br>
  Another TV adaptation of the Bard in all likelihood not seen since its original
  broadcast, <b>The Winter's Tale </b>was produced by the BBC as part of a series
  of ten literary classics, including Ibsen's "Ghosts," Tolstoy's "Anna Karenina" and
  Emily Bronte's "Wuthering Heights." The cast is headed by Robert Shaw, graduate
  of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, actor, novelist and playwright, today
  best remembered as the gritty shark hunter Quint in <em>Jaws</em>, and Rosalie
  Crutchley, a prolific theater and screen actress who appeared in some of BBC's
  earliest adaptations of Shakespeare (as Juliet in 1947 and Goneril in 1948).
  In a surprisingly effective performance, Ron Moody, a stalwart of British musical
  theater, imbues the Cockney-accented thief Autolycus with shades of Fagin from
  the musical "Oliver!," the role Moody originated on stage two years earlier
  and went on to play in Carol Reed’s 1968 film version. <b>The Winter's Tale </b>was
  first broadcast in the U.S. in August 1964 on New York's WOR-TV.<br>

<p><b> Hamlet </b>(Woodfall Films - Filmways, U.K., 1969). Dir Tony Richardson.
  With Nicol Williamson (Hamlet), Anthony Hopkins (Claudius), Judy Parfitt (Gertrude),
  Mark Dignam (Polonius), Marianne Faithfull (Ophelia). (114 min, Technicolor,
  35mm)<br>
    <br>
  Often referred to as "cinema's fastest-talking Hamlet," Nicol Williamson's
  Danish Prince is an anti-establishment figure: brooding, neurotic, cynical,
  and as such perfectly in tune with the sentiments of the late 1960's. The film
  originated as a highly acclaimed stage production at London's Roundhouse, which
  had been built as a locomotive engine repair shop and then used as a gin warehouse
  before becoming a performing arts venue in 1964. Tony Richardson, who also
  directed the play, shot the film in ten days at the Roundhouse itself, relying
  on spare production design, sustained close-ups, and several actors reappearing
  in two or three minor roles (e.g. Roger Livesey, the star of <em>The Life and
  Death of Colonel Blimp</em>, as both Lucianus and the Gravedigger). Watch for
  17-year-old Anjelica Huston as a lady-in-waiting in the scene of Ophelia's
  lament for Polonius.<br>

<p><b> Macbeth </b>(Playboy Productions - Caliban Films, U.K., 1971). Dir Roman
  Polanski. Wrt Polanski, Kenneth Tynan. With Jon Finch (Macbeth), Francesca
  Annis (Lady Macbeth), Martin Shaw (Banquo), Nicholas Selby (Duncan), John Stride
  (Ross), Terence Bayler (Macduff). (140 min, Technicolor, Todd-AO widescreen,
  35mm)<br>
    <br>
  Polanski’s <b>Macbeth </b>stands as a vivid cinematic interpretation of one
  of the world’s bloodiest plays by one of the world’s great directors. Produced
  by Hugh Hefner’s Playboy Productions and made on the heels of the murder of
  the director’s wife by the Manson Family, contemporary reviewers, perhaps understandably,
  found it hard to see beyond the more lurid aspects of the film’s genesis. However
  the points of critical contention (the onscreen violence, the nude sleepwalking
  scene) actually strengthen the film, and Polanski’s own fatalistic sensibility,
  which has characterized even his earliest work, is well suited to Shakespeare’s
  tragedy of ambition, murder and destiny. The adaptation makes liberal textural
  edits and invests some benign secondary characters with Machiavellian intent,
  but whatever the film may occasionally lack in fidelity it more than makes
  up for in texture. Infused with mayhem and suspicion, the brooding medieval
  atmosphere, underscored by the droning dissonances of the Third Ear Band, is
  masterfully sustained. Ultimately the film is marked by Polanski’s unshakable
  skepticism which lends tangible motivation to many of the play’s supernatural
  elements and furnishes a bleak denouement precluding any forecasts of equanimity.<br>

  Price, Diana Rigg, Ian Hendry, Harry Andrews, Coral Browne, Robert Coote, Jack
  Hawkins. (104 min, color, 35mm)<br>
    <br>
  An aging actor systematically murders London's leading theater critics by disposing
  of each victim in a manner modeled on one of Shakespeare's plays. A delightful
  black comedy with an array of superlative performances led by Vincent Price,
  reveling in the over-the-top delivery of the Bard's verses, and Diana Rigg
  as his outrageously disguised daughter. Then there are the victims, including
  Michael Hordern, a pre-eminent Shakespearean himself (both with the Stratford
  Royal Shakespeare Company and the Old Vic) and one of British cinema's top
  character actors, as the critic who is hacked to death by a group of squatters
  (Julius Caesar), and the pink-suited Robert Morley, choked with a pie made
  from his beloved poodles (Titus Andronicus). Other models for the carnage are "Troilus
  and Cressida," "Cymbeline," "The Merchant of Venice," "Richard III," "Othello," "Henry
  VI-Part 1," and "King Lear." In 2005, the film was adapted into a stage production
  at London's National Theatre with Jim Broadbent in the lead.<br>

<p><b> Antony and Cleopatra </b>(ATV Network, U.K., 7/8/1974). Dir Jon Scoffield.
  With Richard Johnson (Antony), Janet Suzman (Cleopatra), Corin Redgrave (Octavius
  Caesar), Patrick Stewart (Enobarbus), Rosemary McHale (Charmian), Constantin
  De Goguel (Ventidius), Raymond Westwell (Lepidus). (160 min, color, U-matic
  video)<br>
    <br>
  Derived from Trevor Nunn's acclaimed 1972 production for the Royal Shakespeare
  Company, and presented by ATV Network, one of Britain's oldest independent
  TV broadcasters, <b>Antony and Cleopatra </b>has been praised for setting "a
  standard for what televised Shakespeare should be" (Kenneth S. Rothwell). Employing
  spare but suggestive production design and intricate camerawork, the production
  masterfully conveys the time and place and effortlessly alternates the action
  between Egypt and Rome. The performances, with the four principals retained
  from the stage production, are magnificent. The two title characters are played
  with an exquisite balance between larger-than-life stature and recognizably
  human contradictions, and Patrick Stewart’s captivating speech describing Cleopatra's
  barge (filmed in an intimate close-up) is a bravura piece of acting not easily
  forgotten.<br>
  <br>
  When <b>Antony and Cleopatra </b>was first broadcast in the U.S. on January
  4, 1975, on ABC, its running time was extended to over three hours by commercial
  breaks. This prompted a flood of angry letters from viewers to The New York
  Times critic John J. O'Connor, who, having seen a preview without the ads,
  praised the program as a "marvelously imaginative interpretation, beautifully
  performed." As one irrate viewer stated, "[...] I shall never buy a product
  I noticed advertised during this production. If I have been in a habit of buying
  such a product, I shall immediately change brands."<br>

  (Macbeth), Judi Dench (Lady Macbeth), John Bowen (Lennox), Susan Drury (Third
  Witch/Lady Macduff), Judith Harte (Second Witch/Gentlewoman), Bob Peck (Macduff).
  (120 min, color, U-matic video)<br>
    <br>
  This adaptation of Trevor Nunn's 1976 production for the Royal Shakespeare
  Company is considered by many as the best made-for-TV Shakespeare ever done.
  The play was originally produced on a budget of 250 pounds sterling and performed
  on a bare stage at The Other Place theater in Stratford-upon-Avon. Phillip
  Casson's TV rendering effectively emphasizes the austerity of the original
  by placing the actors against a dark background and choreographing their movements
  into a religious-like ritual.<br>
  <br>
  The broadcast received rave reviews: "You'll never see a better television
  production of Shakespeare," commented The Guardian, while the London Daily
  Mail concluded that "television is honored by this Macbeth." The two principals
  are at the height of their art. McKellen "drove the play on with an energy
  that grew manic as he was frustrated by forces inward and outward," (Marvin
  Rosenberg), and The Scotsman pronounced that the sleep-walking scene featuring
  Judi Dench's superb, black-clad Lady Macbeth, "will be remembered as long as
  acting is honoured." Among the supporting cast, Ian McDiarmid, who plays both
  Ross and Porter, produces what "surely must be one of the most virtuoso performances
  ever recorded on television" (Kenneth S. Rothwell).<br>

  min, color, 35mm)<br>
    <br>
  Curious version of "The Tempest" by punk maverick, intellectual, and gay activist
  director Derek Jarman who died of an Aids related illness in 1994. His iconoclastic
  approach to film-making came out of his 1960s art school background and he
  became further radicalized, along with the the majority of Britain’s underclass,
  during the extreme conservatism of Thatcher’s reign. Shakespeare purists will
  flinch at the punk aesthetic and kitsch anachronisms, including a camp, Broadway-like
  rendition of "Stormy Weather." But the film will be best appreciated by those
  interested in exploring Jarman’s unique and uncompromising life and career.<br>

<p><b> Design for Living </b>(Paramount, 1933). Dir Ernst Lubitsch. Wrt Ben Hecht,
  based on the play of the same name by Noël Coward. With Fredric March, Gary
  Cooper, Miriam Hopkins, Edward Everett Horton, Franklin Pangborn. (90 min,
  black & white, 35mm)<br>
    <br>
  Known for his sophisticated and subtle sexual comedies, Ernst Lubitsch’s adaptation
  of the Broadway production of "Design for Living" was hailed as a box office "champion" of
  1934—despite objections by the Hays’ office, who found the film’s depiction
  of a three-some morally problematic. Gilda Farrell, a commercial artist, meets
  fellow bohemians George Curtis, a painter, and Thomas B. Chambers, a playwright,
  on a train traveling to Paris. The three Americans become friends, but Gilda
  secretly rendezvous with each man behind the other’s back. While Tom reads
  George the lines to his latest play, "immortality might be fun, but not fun
  enough to take the place of one hundred percent virtue and three square meals
  a day," it soon becomes apparent that both men are in love with Gilda, so they
  make a pact to forget her. One day she shows up at their apartment, and despite
  their agreement, neither man can turn her down. Gilda confesses her sins of
  betrayal to Tom and George, and unable to choose between them, she suggests
  they make a pact to "forget sex and concentrate on work." Gilda moves into
  their apartment and assumes the supportive role of "mother of the arts," but
  the "gentlemen’s agreement" between friends doesn’t last long, as Gilda and
  George can no longer restrain themselves, while Tom is away in London celebrating
  the success of his play.<br>

  We continue our sitcom review with more recent examples of the Bard’s presence
  in popular TV entertainment. When Theo and Cockroach must read "Julius Caesar" as
  part of their history class about Rome, two eminent Shakespeareans, Roscoe
  Lee Browne and Christopher Plummer, are on hand to provide guidance. Followed
  by three takes on the classic love tale. First, Dick suffers illusions of grandeur
  when he is asked to direct a school production of "Romeo and Juliet" (plus
  Wayne Knight’s hilarious take on "Hamlet"). Next, the Wayans brothers get entangled
  in a "Romeo and Juliet" situation as part of the ongoing feud between restaurateurs

  the 21st century with a minimalist, super-hero, gender-bending version of the

<p><b> The Tempest </b>(Columbia, 1982). Dir Paul Mazursky. Wrt Mazursky, Leon
  Capetanos. With John Cassavetes (Phillip), Gena Rowlands (Antonia), Susan Sarandon
  (Aretha), Molly Ringwald (Miranda), Vittorio Gassman (Alonzo), Raul Julia (Kalibanos).
  (140 min, color, 35mm)<br>
    <br>
  In 1974, director Paul Mazursky made <em>Harry and Tonto</em>, championed by
  some eminent Shakespearian scholars (Sam Schoenbaum, Kenneth S. Rothwell) as
  a successful displacement of "King Lear" into modern-day America. Approaching "The
  Tempest," Mazursky's initial idea was to cast Mick Jagger as "an androgynous
  Ariel" in a film that would have resembled "a Marx brothers musical." The project
  eventually became a largely conventional modernization, more in tune with the
  director's often explored themes of dysfunctional relationships and midlife
  marital crises. After attempts to cast Paul Newman fell through, John Cassavetes
  was selected for the Prospero-like role of a successful New York architect
  who runs away from his career and marriage to a remote Greek island with his
  teenage daughter. Ariel becomes Aretha, an American divorcee supporting herself
  as a singer, and Caliban is Kalibanos, a lascivious Greek goatherd.<br>
  <br>
"I wanted to do a movie that would have some of the free form of Shakespeare's
plays, where almost incidentally, you have a little song, a little dance, some
low comedy, a little relief. Shakespeare sort of gives one a little courage to
try things like that" (Mazursky). The result is what critic David Sterritt described
as "an audacious hodge-podge," while Cassavetes himself referred to the film
as "wonderfully imperfect." <b>The Tempest </b>borrows some of the characters
and plot elements from Shakespeare's work, the latter mostly confined to the
final 40 minutes, but crucially moves away from the original by replacing Elizabethan
poetry with modern American English. The music was composed by Japanese multi-instrumentalist
Stomu Yamashta, who also provided the memorable score for Nicolas Roeg's <em>The
Man Who Fell to Earth</em> (1976).<br>

  (Julia), Joanne Pearce (Silvia), Nicholas Kaby (Speed), Tony Haygarth (Launce),
  Paul Daneman (Duke of Milan), David Collings (Thurio). (145 min, color, U-matic
  video)<br>
    <br>
  Rarely seen, even on stage, <b>The Two Gentlemen of Verona </b>received only
  two full-length screen treatments, in 1963 in West Germany as a made-for-TV
  movie, and twenty years later as part of BBC's series <em>The Shakespeare Plays</em>,
  the most ambitious and comprehensive attempt to date to bring the Bard to the
  small screen. Starting with <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> in December 1978 and
  concluding in April 1985 with <em>Titus Andronicus</em>, the BBC project, produced
  in partnership with Time-Life, presented 37 plays adapted and staged specifically
  for television.<br>
  <br>
  One of Shakespeare's earliest works, rich with thematic references to his later
  plays, this story of friendship, love and treachery on the court of the Duke
  of Milan is treated by director Don Taylor in a rather straightforward manner.
  The drama unfolds in a subtly stylized Renaissance setting which includes the
  Garden of Courtly Love, where most of the court action takes place, and a wonderfully
  unrealistic forest, home to a decidedly unthreatening group of ruffians. The
  score was compiled by Anthony Rooley, Renaissance music expert and director
  of the Consort of Musicke ensemble, and consists of arrangements of works by
  the Bard's musical contemporaries. The performances, by both newcomers and
  veterans of British television, are uniformly excellent, with Tessa Peake Jones,
  in an archetypical cross-dressing role, providing a particularly moving portrayal
  of emotional turmoil.<br>

  Jim Davidson. (115 min, color, 35mm)<br>
    <br>
  Identical twin brothers documenting decay at a local zoo form a menage-a-trois
  with an amputee who loses her leg when the car she is driving collides with
  a swan. Greenaway’s astonishingly original contemplation of sexuality, death
  and fearful symmetry infuses cinema with a new vocabulary of ideas otherwise
  associated with art history. Like the best of the Surrealists, Greenaway dares
  to indulge in ill-advised surrender to a host of obsessive compulsions and
  habitual preoccupations. One weirdly familiar tableau follows another with
  all the hallucinatory authority of a fevered nightmare. Greenaway demonstrates
  the ultimate futility of all human endeavor by revealing the entirely arbitrary
  nature of any constructed meaning. But rather than contenting itself with nullifying
  experience, the film has at its core a dark, enigmatic potency which places
  it among the finest examples of cinematic surrealism. Inspiration abounds in
  all departments, not least the vivid luminosity of Sacha Vierny’s cinematography
  and a nerve-wracking score by composer Michael Nyman.<br>

    <br>
"Indisputably one of the best films ever made about theatre" (Variety), this
story about a group of traveling players touring provincial Britain during World
War II was adapted for the screen by Ronald Harwood from his own play, which
in turn was based on the career of the legendary Shakespearean actor Donald Wolfit
(1902-1968), for whom Harwood had worked as a dresser.<br>
  <br>
  A graduate of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, Albert Finney established
  himself as a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company before making a splash
  as a working-class rebel in the landmark film <em>Saturday Night and Sunday
  Morning</em> (1960), and then gaining international fame by playing the title
  character in Tony Richardson's <em>Tom Jones</em> (1963). Although he continued
  to appear in a number of stage productions of Shakespeare plays, <b>The Dresser </b>is
  his one and only interpretation of the Bard on screen. Finney's character,
  a spoiled and moody tyrant referred to only as "Sir" in the film, appears on
  stage as King Lear, quotes Macbeth from his hospital bed, and is also seen
  in the death scene from "Othello." Tom Courtenay, another stalwart of British
  realist cinema of the 1960's (<em>The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner,
  Billy Liar</em>), is Sir's personal assistant and confidant, the Fool to Finney's
  King. "What are we doing tomorrow?" asks an exhausted Sir after a performance
  of "Othello." "Lear" replies the dresser. "How does that begin?" asks Sir.

    <br>
"Kenneth Branagh has done it. Who is Kenneth Branagh?" asked The New York Times
on the eve of the U.S. opening of <b>Henry V </b>. The 28-year-old Irishman's
directorial debut was a surprising success, even drawing favorable comparisons
to his celebrated predecessor, Laurence Olivier, who was 37 when he directed
his screen version of the play. In Branagh’s words "Where there has been resistance,
it's been based on a kind of 'How dare you!' philosophy, but I wouldn't agree
with that. I think Laurence Olivier would be the first person to say a) 'You
cheeky devil,' and b) 'Go ahead.'" At the time he made the film, Branagh was
already an established Shakespearean, having played Henry V for the Royal Shakespeare
Company in 1984 as well as several leading roles ("Hamlet," Benedick in "Much
Ado About Nothing") for his own Renaissance Theatre Company.<br>
  <br>
  Unlike Olivier's stylized celebration of British patriotism, Branagh opts for
  a decidedly unglamourous, down-to-earth approach, with bloody battle scenes
  and graphic images of sickness and famine among the mud-drenched soldiers.
  As a counterpoint, Derek Jacobi's Chorus opens the film on a soundstage in
  modern dress, and then reappears several times interrupting the action. As
  to the title character, again opposing Olivier whose Henry is a heroic figure
  from the start, Branagh's king is gradually transformed during the course of
  the action, attaining "a heroic stature almost in spite of himself" (Daniel
  Rosenthal). The critical and commercial success of <b>Henry V </b>was instrumental
  in bringing Shakespeare back into the cinematic mainstream both in the U.K.
  and Hollywood. Shunned for decades as box-office poison, the Bard suddenly
  became the darling of screen writers and directors. As Al Pacino, who himself
  tackled "Richard III" in 1996 (<em>Looking for Richard</em>), stated: "Branagh
  opened it all up with <b>Henry V </b>. That was just an explosion."<br>

<p class = "feature"> Screening Shakespeare</p>
<p><b> Prospero’s Books </b>(Allarts - Cinéa - Camera One - Penta, Netherlands/France/Italy,
  1991). Dir & Wrt Peter Greenaway. With John Gielgud (Prospero), Michel Blanc
  (Alonso), Michael Clark (Caliban), Erland Josephson, (Gonzalo) Isabelle Pasco
  (Miranda), Tom Bell (Antonio), Kenneth Cranham (Sebastian), Mark Rylance (Ferdinand).
  (129 min, color, 35mm)<br>
    <br>
  Intelligent, fascinating multimedia presentation of "The Tempest" is a sophisticated
  amalgam of text, opera, dance, painting and the spoken word. Unlike other cinematic
  interpreters like Luhrmann and Taymor, Greenaway realizes that Shakespeare
  was already ahead of the postmodern curve and he illuminates the renaissance
  universe with a keen curatorial eye. Gielgud’s magisterial elocution brings
  the poetry to the fore and the link between Prospero’s magus and Shakespeare
  the creator is firmly established. Michael Nyman’s splendid, fully realized
  operatic score encapsulates the play’s description of its mysterious locale
  as an isle of "noyses, sounds, and sweet aires". The film is cleverly punctuated
  throughout by animated pages from volumes in Prospero’s library which perfectly
  capture the play’s enigmatic blend of superstition and enlightenment.<br>

"Three monsters ... they are scary!" So goes the trailer for this widescreen
meditation on the crossroads of science and real estate. Developers uncover a
hidden island in the South Pacific and make plans for a family resort. Meanwhile,
a satellite falls from the sky bearing the titular organism and her transformative
powers. And this is how the island is taken over by three giant creatures: a
cuttlefish, a crab and a snapping turtle. "Who will win? Man or monsters?" This
was the penultimate film by director Ishiro Honda, who unleashed Godzilla on
an unsuspecting world and said of his terrifying creations, "Monsters are born
too tall, too strong, too heavy; that is their tragedy." Originally released
in America as <em>Yog: Monster from Outer Space</em>, this is a rare chance to
see a classic of Japanese monsterism in a pristine scope print.<br>

<p class = "feature"> Screening Shakespeare</p>
<p><b> Othello </b>(Dakota Films - Imminent Films, U.K., 1995). Dir & Adapt Oliver
  Parker. With Laurence Fishburne (Othello), Irène Jacob (Desdemona), Kenneth
  Branagh (Iago),, Nathaniel Parker (Cassio), Anna Patrick (Emilia), Michael
  Maloney (Roderigo), Nicholas Farrell (Montano), Gabriele Ferzetti (Duke of
  Venice), Pierre Vaneck (Brabantio). (124 min, Technicolor, 35mm)<br>
    <br>
  In the wake of Kenneth Branagh's success, first-time director Oliver Parker's <b>Othello </b>,
  similarly to Franco Zeffirelli's <em>Hamlet</em> five years earlier, was an
  attempt to bring Shakespeare to the moviegoing masses by casting a well-known
  Hollywood actor in the title role, emphasizing the eroticism, and truncating
  the play to accommodate the multiplex-driven two-hour time slot. At the same
  time, Parker, an established stage and TV actor, mostly stays away from the
  visual fireworks and narrative twists common in latter-day screen adaptations
  of the Bard. Hopes for a commercial success, however, were left unfulfilled
  as the film didn't even come close to recuperating its $11 million production
  cost.<br>
  <br>
  In the lead, Laurence Fishburne, the first Black actor to play Othello on screen,
  emphasizes the physicality of the character and adopts a Carribean accent not
  unlike Laurence Olivier in the 1965 film version of the play. Branagh, sporting
  close cropped hair and a leather jacket and often addressing the camera directly,
  is obviously enjoying himself as the villain of the piece, while Swiss/French
  actress Irène Jacob, probably best known in the U.S. from Krzysztof Kieslowski's <em>Three
  Colors: Red</em> (1994), seems somewhat uncomfortable with the Elizabethan
  verses in the severely reduced role of Desdemona.<br>

    <br>
  Two episodes of the cable TV series <b>Remember WENN </b>and the pilot episode
  of ABC’s <b>Homefront </b>make up the entertainment for this evening of nostalgia
  television. The first is a witty, easygoing sitcom set in a 1939 Pittsburgh
  radio station; the second, a dramatic look at the changed lives of ordinary
  citizens and returning soldiers in the aftermath of World War II. Both shows
  won several Emmy Awards for costuming, makeup and writing, but struggled to
  win viewers.<br>
  <br>
  The two <b>Remember WENN </b>episodes represent well the creator Rupert Holmes’ wit
  and style, a mix of kitschy slapstick and bittersweet nostalgia. In <b>Klondike
  9366 </b>, AMC host Bob Dorian guest stars as a WENN sponsor backing a new
  type of radio program: the late-night call in show. Hosted by station lothario
  Jeffrey Singer and bubbly newcomer Celia Mellon (two L’s, as in Andrew W. Mellon – the
  local billionaire), "It’s Your Nickel" may be what finally puts Pittsburgh
  radio on the map… if only they can afford to stay on the air. In <b>Sight Unseen </b>,
  Molly Ringwald guests as blind "Angela from Avalon", a devoted listener to
  Mackie Bloom’s romantic "Vagabond". She would like nothing more than to dance
  in the arms of her favorite radio star: a man more handsome than Clark Gable,
  Gary Cooper and Ronald Colman combined…or is he?<br>
  <br>
  A more dramatic offering, ABC’s <b>Homefront </b>leaves behind the sweetly
  nostalgic snapshots of WENN and gives us instead a darker look at the hopeful
  but disenchanted climate of postwar America as soldiers return from the European
  and Pacific fronts to find their lives and their country forever altered. Their
  mothers have worked on the assembly line, their younger brothers have grown
  into men, their girlfriends have moved on – and yet old prejudices remain.
  The world presented here is one as scarred by hardship as Radioland is untouched
  and uncomplicated.<br>

<p><b> Twelfth Night </b>(Renaissance Films, U.K., 1996). Dir & Adapt Trevor
  Nunn. With Helena Bonham Carter (Olivia), Richard E. Grant (Sir Andrew Aguecheek),
  Nigel Hawthorne (Malvolio), Ben Kingsley (Feste), Mel Smith (Sir Toby Belch),
  Imelda Staunton (Maria), Toby Stephens (Orsino), Imogen Stubbs (Viola), Steven
  MacKintosh (Sebastian), Nicholas Farrell (Antonio). (134 min, color, 35mm)<br>
    <br>
  Director of both the Royal Shakespeare Company (1968-1986) and the National
  Theatre (1997-2003), Trevor Nunn has been a leading figure of British theater
  for almost four decades, renowned for his ground-breaking staging of Shakespeare,
  Ibsen, Brecht, Shaw, Chekhov, Dickens, and mega-musicals such as "Cats" and "Les
  Misérables." He also directed operas (Mozart's "Idomeneo," and "Cosi Fan Tutte," Gershwin's "Porgy
  and Bess") and television, beginning with BBC’s 1979 broadcast of Tom Stoppard’s
  play "Every Good Boy Deserves Favour."<br>
  <br>
  <b>Twelfth Night </b>, Nunn's third venture into motion pictures (after <em>Hedda</em> in
  1976 and <em>Lady Jane</em> in 1986), presents Shakespeare's popular work as
  a Chekhovian comedy framed within the lush landscapes and costumes of the 1890's
  (the film was shot on location in Cornwall, England). For Nunn, "Twelfth Night"'s
  study of gender has a decidedly modern resonance, which determined the film's
  style: "I felt the urge to make the content of the play seem real, and not
  pantomimic or stylized, so that the contrary extremes of sexual behavior in
  the central characters are seen in a believable social context. The story sets
  out to provoke both genders in the audience, so it's important that spectators
  shouldn't be able to get off the hook of the play by dismissing it as an improbable,
  archaic comedy."<br>

(NOTE EARLIER START TIME)
<p class = "feature"> Screening Shakespeare</p>
<p><b> William Shakespeare’s Hamlet </b>(Castle Rock Entertainment/Sony Pictures
  Entertainment, 1996). Dir & Adapt Kenneth Branagh. With Branagh (Hamlet), Julie
  Christie (Gertrude), Derek Jacobi (Claudius), Kate Winslet (Ophelia), Richard
  Briers (Polonius), Michael Maloney (Laertes), Nicholas Farrell (Horatio), Brian
  Blessed (Ghost). (220 min, Technicolor, Panavision, 35mm)<br>
    <br>
"Good and bad ideas scrambled together on a huge scale" was how The Independent
described Kenneth Branagh's mammoth production, the longest Shakespeare film
ever made and the first to use the complete, uncut text of a Shakespeare play.
This ambitious project had its roots in Branagh's life-long obsession with "Hamlet," in
particular his starring role in two full-text productions of the play, for the
BBC radio and the Royal Shakespeare Company, both in 1992. Persuading a Hollywood
studio to put up $18 million for the film version, however, was an all together
different matter, although the proposed budget was relatively modest considering
the size of the production. An added problem was the fiasco of Branagh's first
tinsel-town project, <em>Mary Shelley's Frankenstein</em>. As a 1997 article
in The Scotsman explained, Branagh sold the film to Castle Rock Entertainment
by pointing out "that it begins like <em>Jaws</em> (with horrible suspense),
and ends like Stormin’ Norman Schwarzkopf going in for the kill. Even the advertising
promises ‘more artificial snow than in <em>Dr. Zhivago</em>'"<br>
  <br>
  The visual splendor of the film matches its literary pretensions: the widescreen
  photography brings to the fore the elegant costumes and stunning production
  design, with the interiors built at England's Shepperton Studios and exteriors
  shot at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire. Branagh moved the action to the late
  19th century and sprinkled (some would say burdened) the film with star cameos,
  including Jack Lemmon (Marcellus), Robin Williams (Osric), Charlton Heston
  (Player King), and Billy Crystal (Gravedigger). The lush visuals and star-studded
  cast could not overcome the intimidating running time, and the film's box-office
  performance was doomed from the start. Don't miss this rare opportunity to
  see Kenneth Branagh's <b>Hamlet </b>on the big screen on the eve of its long-anticipated
  DVD release.<br>

    <br>
  Best known for his <em>Divorce, Italian Style</em>, Germi once again takes

  Miriam Margolyes (The Nurse), Pete Postlethwaite (Father Laurence). (115 min,
  color, Panavision, 35mm)<br>
    <br>
  Baz Luhrmann employs every MTV trick in this comic book Shakespeare for the
  teen set. While maintaining the original language, the film has a mix-tape
  soundtrack including tracks by the Butthole Surfers, Garbage and Radiohead
  and there are enough car chases and fiery explosions to keep the attention
  of even the most restless adolescent. As with the music selections, the cinematic
  style vacillates between loud "in your face" bravado and soft-pop romanticism.
  Teen idol DiCaprio visibly struggles with his lines while Clare Danes’s manages
  to radiate some charm as a mall-brat Juliet. The whole enterprise is shamelessly
  kitsch, crass and commercial so will seem fresh and exhilarating or induce
  an ice-cream headache, depending on your disposition. No doubt the film will
  serve as a useful talking point for despairing highschool teachers.<br>

  A likable and dynamic performer even back in his Lonesome Luke days, Harold
  Lloyd hit comedy pay dirt when he donned a pair of horn rims. His bespectacled
  young go-getter fairly bursts with ingenuity and nervous energy, but he also
  radiates a small-town decency that makes him an audience favorite. Best of
  all is Lloyd’s lissome physicality, which is on resplendent display in <b>Safety
  Last </b>. Of the movie’s most famous scene, Tom Dardis writes, "Harold Lloyd’s
  long, tortuous climb up the side of an office building in downtown Los Angeles
  is among the permanent images in film history. It rivals for sheer memorability
  include the Odessa Steps sequence in Eisenstein’s <em>Potemkin</em>, Chaplin’s
  lonely dance of the rolls in <em>The Gold Rush</em>, and Keaton’s flight from
  all the police of the world in <em>Cops</em>."<br>

  U-matic video)<br>
    <br>
  Staged by Nicholas Hytner as part of the Lincoln Center Festival 98 and broadcast
  live on PBS from the Vivian Beaumont Theater, this production of Shakespeare's
  classic romantic comedy follows in the footsteps of modern film adaptations
  of the Bard by casting well-known Hollywood names in the lead roles: Helen
  Hunt had just won an Oscar for <em>As Good As It Gets</em>, while Paul Rudd
  was riding high on the success of the hit comedy <em>The Object of My Affection</em> (also
  directed by Hytner). In contrast to the parade of good looking physiques of
  the four leads and their entourages, Brian Murray, a veteran of the Royal Shakespeare
  Company in a superb take on the character of Olivia's parasitic uncle, and
  Max Wright, as his dim-witted friend, almost walk away with the show. Hytner's
  watery Illyria comes across as a vaguely Middle-Eastern fairy tale, with the
  music emphasizing an opium induced otherworldliness - or, as The New York Times
  put it, "a place, after all, of much mirth and beguiling spectacle - [Illyria]
  remains an inviting oasis for theatergoers in search of escape from Manhattan
  in its dog days, and their own midsummer madness." The broadcast was hosted
  by the recently deceased opera diva Beverly Sills.<br>

  (180 min, color, U-matic video)<br>
    <br>
  One of the few television adaptations of Shakespeare not based on a prior stage
  production, Granada TV's <b>King Lear </b>provided Laurence Olivier, unable
  to appear on stage for some years due to ill health, with an opportunity to
  play the title role for the first time since 1946, when he starred as Lear
  at the Old Vic (with Alec Guinness as the Fool). The 1983 production is extremely
  faithful to the original text - only three scenes have been cut entirely. It
  was taped in a Manchester studio on sets representing 9th century England and
  including a replica of the druidic ruins at Stonehenge. Not surprisingly, considering
  Olivier's stature and advanced age, the reviews primarily focused on his performance.
  In the article "The Sweetness of Age," Stanley Wells summed it up succinctly: "It
  is good that he [Olivier] has been given this late chance to demonstrate, to
  a new generation and in a new medium, his technical and interpretative genius
  in a great Shakespearean role."<br>

  is adeptly portrayed by Sissy Spacek, who won the Best Actress Oscar in 1980

  Hamlet: To be or not to be...<br>
  Mike: The verbal equivalent of 'da-da-da-dum'!<br>
  <br>
  How do you make a poor, substantially altered, laborious, English-dubbed 1960’s
  West German television adaptation of "Hamlet" starring Maximilian Schell as
  the troubled Dane more entertaining? You could try altering one’s state of
  consciousness or better yet, watch the film in an episode of <b>Mystery Science
  Theater 3000 </b>. The series first appeared on a local television station
  in Minneapolis, MN, in 1988 and quickly made the jump to Comedy Central, then
  the Sci-Fi Channel. The premise: Originally Joel, then Mike, is held prisoner
  on an orbiting satellite by an evil scientist and is forced to watch bad movies.
  The movies are shown while Mike, along with his robot friends, Crow and Tom
  Servo, sit in silhouette at the bottom of the screen and make jokes and wisecracks.<br>
  <br>
  To quote Mike, Franz Peter Wirth’s <em>Hamlet</em> is "a production that likes
  to show people watching other people." Many of the speeches are delivered as
  thoughts in a character’s head, relying on facial expressions and lingering
  camera movements to convey meaning. During the scene between Hamlet and his
  father's ghost, the camera is frozen in a close-up of Hamlet, seemingly locked
  in position for a good twenty minutes. To Maximilian Schell’s credit, his portrayal
  of the title character as the vulnerable and conflicted prince is respectable.
  The set is dark and oppressive, the costuming is laughable, and the dubbing
  is somewhat distracting. Is that Ricardo Montalban as Claudius? You betcha!<br>
  <br>
  The film is made watchable in the hands of Mike, Crow and Tom Servo--snide
  comments, witty jokes and double entendres abound. Witness the premier of the
  game show of "Alas, Poor Who?" and be the first to own the Hamlet action figure
  complete with pull-string soliloquy.<br>

"Genius Grant" recipient and Broadway director (The Lion King) Julie Taymor’s
first theatrical motion picture is an ostentatious, arty romp through one of
Shakespeare’s earliest and most macabre plays. Taymor’s Rome is an anachronistic
melange of ancient and twentieth century styles that borrows particularly heavily
from 1930's fascist Italy. Many of the anachronisms seem arbitrary (chariots
and automobiles share the same streets and speeches are delivered through modern
public address systems), and the cinematic language riffs on slick Hollywood
cliches. While skeptics will find themselves questioning the stylistic rationale
behind much of this postmodern pastiche, Grand Guignol enthusiasts and admirers

    <b>Le Voyage en Ballon = Stowaway in the Sky </b>(Filmsonor - Films Montsouris,
    France, 1960). Dir & Wrt Albert Lamorisse. With Pascal Lamorisse, Maurice
    Baquet. (84 min, Technicolor, Dyaliscope, 35mm)<br>
    <br>
  Albert Lamorisse (1922-1970) was a Parisian photographer turned writer and
  filmmaker best known for his 1956 film <b>The Red Balloon </b>, a gorgeous
  Technicolor fantasy set in the streets of Paris. This charming film was a children’s
  film staple for decades after its release. Although it is probably the most
  widely seen French film of all time, it has never received a proper video release,
  a fate shared by Lamorisse ’s other films. This evening is a rare opportunity
  to see three of Lamorisse’s groundbreaking works on the big screen.<br>
  <br>
  <b>White Mane </b>, made in 1953, is a somewhat more conventional narrative
  of a boy and the wild horse he saves from ranchers in the marsh country of
  Camargue in the south of France. This beautifully shot black and white film
  brought Lamorrise his first international attention, and was frequently screened
  alongside <em>The Red Balloon</em>.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Stowaway in the Sky </b>was Lamorisse’s first feature film. It tells the
  story of a balloonist and his ten year old grandson (played by the director’s
  son Pascal, who played the boy in <em>The Red Balloon</em>) and their visually
  dazzling widescreen voyage across France to the Alps. <b>Stowaway in the Sky </b>so
  impressed the American actor Jack Lemmon that he purchased the American rights
  and prepared the English language version that we will be screening tonight.
  In spite of it’s stunning aerial photography, a glorious soundtrack and the
  endorsement of a major Hollywood star, the film never found the international
  audience that Lamorisse’s earlier work did.<br>

<p class = "feature"> Screening Shakespeare</p>
<p><b> William Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream </b>(20th Century-Fox
  - Regency Entertainment - Monarchy Enterprises, U.S./Germany, 1999). Dir & Wrt
  Michael Hoffman. With David Strathairn (Theseus), Sophie Marceau (Hippolyta),
  Anna Friel (Hermia), Dominic West (Lysander), Christian Bale (Demetrius), Kevin
  Kline (Nick Bottom), Michelle Pfeiffer (Titania), Rupert Everett (Oberon),
  Stanley Tucci (Puck), Calista Flockhart (Helena). (116 min, color, widescreen,
  35mm)<br>
    <br>
  The epitome of Hollywood's new found love affair with Shakespeare, this screen
  adaptation of "A Midsummer Night's Dream" follows Kenneth Branagh's example
  by moving the story into a more modern setting, in this case from ancient Greece
  to Tuscany in the 1890's, dressing it in ravishing production design, and packing
  the cast with popular stars of the day, from "veterans" Pfeiffer and Kline
  to <em>Ally McBeal's</em> Calista Flockhart. The forest scenes were shot on
  the Cinecittà sound stages in Rome and with their decidedly theatrical feel
  are somewhat reminiscent of Max Reinhardt's 1935 version.<br>
  <br>
"At the beginning I just had an image of this fat little Puck riding through
the Tuscan countryside on the back of a turtle. The rest of the film sort of
spun out from that" (Michael Hoffman). A graduate of Boise State University (BA
in theater arts), Hoffman (<em>Restoration, The Emperor's Club</em>) was a Rhodes
scholar at Oxford and one of the founders of the Idaho Shakespeare Festival.
Notwithstanding the inevitable truncation of the original text, his key intervention
was adding the character of Bottom's wife, a "shrew" who considers her husband
a pompous fool.<br>

<h3>Wednesday, August 29 (7:00pm)</h3>
<p><b> 5 Fingers </b>(20th Century-Fox, 1952). Dir Joseph L. Mankiewicz. Wrt
  Michael Wilson, based on the book "Der fall Cicero" by L. C. Moyzisch. With
  James Mason, Danielle Darrieux, Michael Rennie, Walter Hampden, Oscar Karlweis.
  (108 min, black & white, 35mm)<br>
    <br>
  James Mason's matinee-idol looks enabled him to become one of those rare character
  actors whose performance could sustain a picture. By the time he played the
  master spy Diello, who sold military secrets to the Germans in World War II,
  Mason had raised urbanity to a heightened level. With every move and gesture
  he's the perfect valet and the perfect scoundrel. His courtship of Countess
  Anna, a great schemer herself, is an example of what happens when a servant
  tries to rise above his station.<br>

<p class = "feature"> Screening Shakespeare</p>
<p><b> Hamlet </b>(Double A Films/Miramax, 2000). Dir & Wrt Michael Almereyda.
  With Ethan Hawke (Hamlet), Diane Venora (Gertrude), Kyle MacLachlan (Claudius),
  Julia Stiles (Ophelia), Bill Murray (Polonius), Liev Schreiber (Laertes), Karl
  Geary (Horatio), Sam Shepard (Ghost). (112 min, color, 35mm)<br>
    <br>
  The CEO of the Denmark Corporation dies under mysterious circumstances; his
  son Hamlet returns to New York to find his mother already re-married - to his
  uncle. Among director Michael Almereyda previous features was a vampire movie
  shot entirely with a toy video camera that produces grainy, ambiguous black
  and white images. In this <b>Hamlet </b>, the melancholy Dane is an aspiring
  filmmaker who himself wields that toy camera. For <b>Hamlet </b>, like his
  sensory-overloaded Manhattan, is here preoccupied with images that dizzy the
  arithmetic of memory and unreliably hold the mirror up to nature. The cast
  includes two actors who played Hamlet on stage: Liev Schreiber you could have
  guessed, but how many stage Hamlets have gone on to play Gertrude? (one: Diane
  Venora). With Sam Sheperd as the Ghost (first spied in a surveillance camera)
  and Bill Murray as Polonius.<br>

<p class = "feature"> Screening Shakespeare</p>
<p><b> She’s the Man </b>(Donners' Co./DreamWorks, 2006). Dir Andy Fickman. With
  Amanda Bynes, Channing Tatum, Laura Ramsey, Vinnie Jones, David Cross, Julie
  Hagerty. (105 min, color, 35mm)<br>
    <br>
  Olivia (Amanda Bynes) pretends to be a boy so she can play soccer for Illyria
  Prep. Thus we close our Screening Shakespeare series with this tween comedy. "Inspired" by "Twelfth
  Night," it replaces sibling separation anxiety with the Hollywood conventions
  of who-am-i/why-is-my-body-changingism. What little of Shakespeare's language
  that's left is shoehorned in; the role of Malvolio is, in a final insult, reduced
  to a pet tarantula. But why not turn the play's ideas of transformation and
  identity into a coming-of-age story? Music plays on indeed: Sebastian is not
  lost at sea but has simply run off to England with his garage band; and his
  sister Olivia’s gender-bending is nothing short of an Elvis Presley impersonation.<br>

<h3>Tuesday, September 4 (7:00pm)</h3>
<p><b> Age of Consent </b>(Nautilus Productions, Australia, 1969).  Dir Michael Powell.  Wrt Peter Yeldham, based on the novel by Norman Lindsay.  With James Mason, Helen Mirren, Jack MacGowran, Neva Carr-Glyn, Andonia Katsaros. (98 min, color, 35mm)  NOTE: Print has some color fading<br>
    <br>
  Visionary director Michael Powell's (<em>Red Shoes, Peeping Tom</em>) final completed feature, a mellow comedy-drama variation on the theme of the artist looking back on his life.  James Mason is a New York painter, retired to the Great Barrier Reef, who finds his artistic drive renewed by the young and naked Helen Mirren (see also <em>Savage Messiah</em>, 9/18).<br>

<p class = "feature"> Costa-Gavras</p>
<p><b> Un Homme de Trop = Shock Troops </b>(Terra Films - Les Productions Artistes Associ&eacute;s - Compagnia Cinematografica Montoro - Sol Produzioni, France/Italy, 1967).  Dir Costa-Gavras.  Wrt Costa-Gavras, Daniel Boulanger, based on the novel by Jean-Pierre Chabrol.  With Jean-Claude Brialy, Bruno Cremer, Jacques Perrin, G&eacute;rard Blain, Claude Brasseur, Michel Piccoli. (106 min, Technicolor, Techniscope, 35mm)<br>
    <br>
  Feverish intensity through precision editing and photographic cunning are the talents displayed by Costa-Gavras in his tribute to the French Maquis.  During WWII, twelve captured French soldiers await execution in a German prison camp.  After a daring and bloody escape, they manage to release an entire prison filled with refugees.  When the soldiers meet outside the walls, their number has increased from twelve to an unlucky thirteen.  Number 13 carries no ID, and now the others must decide whether he should die.  Their decision is distracted by fighting off hordes of Nazi storm troopers that are closing in on them.  Costa-Gavras, a master in kinesics, has his almost entirely male cast striking for the jugular in this tense action film about honor, deception and paranoia.<br>

<p class = "feature"> Costa-Gavras</p>
<p><b> Z </b>(Reggane Films - O.N.C.I.C, France/Algeria, 1969).  Dir Costa-Gavras.  Wrt Costa-Gavras, Jorge Semprun, based on the novel by Vassilis Vassilikos.  With Yves Montand, Jean-Louis Trintignant, Jacques Perrin, Fran&ccedil;ois P&eacute;rier, Irene Papas. (127 min, color, 35mm)<br>
    <br>
  Premier film critic Pauline Kael wrote of this film: "Costa-Gavras's extraordinary thriller--one of the fastest, most exciting melodramas ever made--was based on contemporary events in Greece.  The picture never loses emotional contact with the audience; it derives from the traditions of the American gangster movies and prison pictures and anti-Fascist melodramas of the 40s.  The young Greek expatriate director uses a searching, active camera style that's a little too self-consciously dynamic, and his staccato editing style and the use of loud music to build up suspense for the violent sequences put a lot of pressure on you.  He gets you in his grip and squeezes you to react the way he wants you to.  The story is based on the Lambrakis affair, as it was presented in fictional form in the novel &lsquo;Z,&rsquo; by the Greek exile Vassili Vassilikos.  In 1965, Lambrakis, a professor of medicine, was struck down by a delivery truck as he left a peace meeting; the investigation of his death uncovered such a scandalous network of corruption and illegality in the police and in the government that the leader of the opposition party, George Papandreou, became Premier.  But in 1967 a military coup d'&eacute;tat overturned the legal government.  The movie re-enacts the murder and the investigation in an attempt to show how the mechanics of fascist corruption may be hidden under the mask of law and order.  It was shot in Algeria, in French, as a French-Algerian co-production, with a score by Mikis Theodorakis (who was under house arrest in Greece at the time), and a script by Jorge Semprun, an exile from Spain.  When the picture is over and you've caught your breath you know perfectly well that its techniques of excitation could as easily be used by a smart fascist filmmaker, if there were one. Luckily there isn't."<br>

<p class = "feature"> Costa-Gavras</p>
<p><b> &Eacute;tat de Si&egrave;ge = State of Siege </b>(Reggane Films - Euro International Films - Unidis - Dieter Geissler Filmproduktion, France/Italy/West Germany, 1973).  Dir Costa-Gavras.  Wrt Franco Solinas, Costa-Gavras.  With Yves Montand, Renato Salvatori, O. E. Hasse, Jacques Weber, Jean-Luc Bideau. (120 min, Eastmancolor, 35mm)<br>
    <br>
  An American diplomat (Montand) is found dead in Uruguay, kidnaped and murdered by the Tupamaro guerillas.  What unravels are the seven days leading to his demise: espionage, political corruption and ideals warped and lead astray.  Is this man simply a diplomat or has he been training the country's police in sophisticated counter-insurgency and torture techniques under shallow cover?  Will his death show the strength of the resistance and encourage the toppling of the corrupt government?  The question of whether the guerillas are terrorists or freedom fighters is at the heart of the <b>State of Siege </b>. 
  
  Developing the narrative in flash-backs, Costa-Gavras takes aim at the tyrannical right-wing government of a Latin American country.  It is a re-creation of a true story of the interrogation of AID officer Daniel Mitrione by the Tupamoros in Uruguay.  Subordinate to the political ideas is a blitzkrieg on American imperialism and its accomplices around the world.  One could argue that this film is as strong a statement now as it was 35 years ago, if not stronger.<br>

<p><b> Train de Vie = Train of Life </b>(No&eacute; Productions - Le Studio Canal Plus - Rapha&euml;l Films - 71 A - Hungry Eye Lowland Pictures, France/Belgium/Romania/Netherlands, 1998).  Dir & Wrt Radu Mihaileanu.  With Lionel Abelanski, Rufus, Cl&eacute;ment Harari, Michel Muller, Bruno Abraham-Kremer, Agathe de La Fontaine. (103 min, color, scope, 35mm)<br>
    <br>
  During the dark days of 1941, the inhabitants of a Jewish village learn of the imminent arrival of the Nazis. How should they outwit the enemy?  Thanks to the inspiration of the town fool, they decide on a plan: obtain a train, disguise some of the locals as soldiers to protect them, and ride east all the way to Palestine.  This poignant fable about a community&rsquo;s determination to survive is graced with plenty of humor and sly charm.  Yorgos Arvanitis and Laurent Dailland&rsquo;s widescreen cinematography captures the ravishing Romanian countryside; Goran Bregovic&rsquo;s protean music is an invigorating accompaniment.<br>

<h3>Tuesday, September 11 (7:00pm)</h3>
<p><b> Peter Pan </b>(NBC, 12/8/1960).  Dir Vincent J. Donehue.  Originally staged, choreographed and adapted by Jerome Robbins, based on the play by J. M. Barrie.  With Mary Martin, Cyril Ritchard, Maureen Bailey, Margalo Gillmore, Sondra Lee. (120 min, color, U-matic video)<br>
    <br>
  With all the attention given these days to the Disney Channel&rsquo;s <em>High School Musical</em>, appreciation should be paid to this nationally televised musical production of <b>Peter Pan </b>.  Compared to an earlier, New York stage vehicle created for Jean Arthur and Boris Karloff, with music and lyrics by Leonard Bernstein, this newer production was staged, choreographed and adapted for Broadway and television by Jerome Robbins.  Mary Martin as Peter and Cyril Ritchard as Mr. Darling/Captain Hook, both won Tony awards for their roles in the 1954 Broadway run.  The score was written by several folks: original lyrics by Carolyn Leigh and music by Moose Charlap, with additional music by Jule Styne and additional lyrics by Betty Comden and Adolph Green.  By popular demand, the show was aired seven times on NBC from 1955 (originally under the heading of <em>Producers&rsquo; Showcase</em>) to 1989, and although released on home video, the out-of-print DVD easily fetches several hundred dollars on the collectors&rsquo; market.<br>

<p><b> Geheimnisse Einer Seele = Secrets of a Soul </b>(Neumann-Film-Produktion for Ufa, Germany, 1926).  Dir G. W. Pabst.  Wrt Colin Ross, Hans Neumann.  With Werner Krauss, Ruth Weyher, Ilka Gr&uuml;ning, Jack Trevor, Pawel Pawlow. (81 min, black & white, 16mm)<br>
    <br>
  In <b>Secrets of a Soul </b>, renowned director Georg Wilhelm Pabst explores Freudian psychoanalysis, especially its connection to dreams.  For this film, Pabst contacted two assistants of Freud, Drs. Hans Sachs and Karl Abraham for background information, and used an actual case history as the framework.  The film concerns a professor who begins to have disturbing thoughts and dreams after the return of his wife&rsquo;s cousin from India and a nearby murder.  He dreams of killing his wife and exhibits a phobia of knives.  In desperation, he goes under the care of a psychoanalyst who probes the mysteries of his subconscious.  The dream sequences are the core of the film and are especially impressive since they were made without a modern optical printer and were done using only the camera itself.<br>

<p><b> They Live by Night </b>(RKO, 1948).  Dir Nicholas Ray.  Wrt Charles Schnee, Nicholas Ray, from the novel by Edward Anderson.  With Cathy O&rsquo;Donnell, Farley Granger, Howard Da Silva, Jay C. Flippen, Helen Craig. (95 min, black & white, 35mm)<br>
    <br>
  In his masterful directorial debut, Nicholas Ray introduces his outcast lovers with the caption, "This boy and this girl were never properly introduced to the world we live in."  This film is known as the most tender of noirs, owing to the sweet, albeit doomed, romance of its lead characters.  The couple's naive hope of escaping the criminal life is shattered in one cruel and unforgettable scene.  Astonishing aerial shots (purportedly the first use of a helicopter) and innovative framing hem in the fugitives and contrast strikingly  with the expressionistic night shots.  An atmosphere permeated in turn by innocence, vulnerability, melancholy, and violence, it resonates with the fatalistic tone of a ballad.  This outlaw-lovers-on-the-lam film was based on Edward Anderson's novel "Thieves Like Us," also adapted for the screen by Robert Altman in 1974.<br>

  <br>
  An obscure border crossing in a remote corner of the Golan Heights is the setting of the overtly political comedy about a Syrian bride named Mona, who hopes to cross from Israel into Syria so she can enter  into an arranged marriage with a Syrian soap opera star she has never met.  On her way to meet her fianc&eacute;, Mona encounters red tape at the checkpoint between Jerusalem and Ramallah after the Syrians refuse to accept her passport because it has an Israeli stamp.  Meanwhile, Mona&rsquo;s intended groom and his family roast in the burning sun as they anxiously await her arrival from one side of the border, while she is stuck with her family on the other.  The situation becomes increasingly more complex as Mona is unable to get rid of the stamp because the Israelis require that she have it to leave the country.  To make matters worse, Mona&rsquo;s fears her father will be arrested as he has just been released from an Israeli jail as a political prisoner and the terms of his parole prohibit him from being too close to the border.  Caught between the political positions of two opposing nations, Mona and those around her confront a never-ending stream of insurmountable and paradoxical situations in an ongoing attempt to manage the simple events of their personal lives.<br>
  <br>
  Preceded by <b>Waiting </b>, a rarely seen work by Iranian director and writer Amir Naderi, in which the filmmaker draws on his own early life as an orphan and street urchin to create a powerful and daring story of a sensitive young boy struggling on the verge of manhood.  One day Amiro appears at the home of his rich neighbor, and through a crack in the door spots a pair of beautiful hands offering him a portion of ice in a crystal bowl.  Enchanted by the beautiful hands of the mysterious woman, the boy slowly develops an emotional attachment to her that borders upon obsession.  A film almost totally without dialogue and plot, <b>Waiting </b>has been described as the most beautiful of Naderi&rsquo;s films, and one of the most visually striking films in the history of Iranian Cinema.<br>

    <br>
  This heartfelt bio of French sculptor Henri Gaudier-Brzeska (1891-1915) was Ken Russell's return to the style of his early BBC films.  A comparatively restrained (by Russell's standards) and almost gentle portrait of a young artist, the self-financed <b>Savage Messiah </b>was for the director something of a fictionalized autobiography.  The late Dame Dorothy Tutin is outstanding as Polish writer Sophie Brzeska, the woman with whom Gaudier shared a passionate yet torturously platonic relationship.  As a suffragette, Helen Mirren once again doffs her clothes in the cause of art.<br>

    <br>
  A tenacious 13-year-old girl, Wei Minzhi, becomes a substitute teacher in her rural village&rsquo;s primary school when the regular teacher leaves to help his ailing mother.  The older teacher warns the girl not to lose even one student during his absence and promises a cash incentive for her success.  When a young boy abandons school to get work in the city, Wei sets out to find him and bring him back but quickly finds the task much harder than she imagined.  Even with the absence of his actress/muse Gong Li, director Zhang Yimou&rsquo;s penchant for and success with stories featuring interesting heroines remains.  The film, with its focus on the strength and vulnerability of children, is reminiscent of the work of Iranian directors Jafar Panahi (<em>White Balloon, The Mirror</em>) and Majid Majidi (<em>Children of Heaven, The Color of Paradise</em>).<br>

    <br>
  In 1920's rural China, textile-dying shop owner Jinshan, a wealthy, cruel, impotent man, wants nothing more than his new bride, Ju Dou, to produce him a son.  At night he tortures Ju Dou while Tianqing, his nephew, listens from the next room.  It does not take long for Tianqing to fall in love with Ju Dou and soon an affair commences.  She becomes pregnant by Tianqing, but convinces Jinshan that he is the father.  The baby grows into a hateful, demonic child while Ju Dou and Tianqing continue their scheming and deception.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Ju Dou </b>was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1990 after being suppressed by the Chinese government.  This film gives us an example of director Zhang Yimou's use of color - the prints were generated with Technicolor&rsquo;s dye transfer technology, in use in China long after its demise in the U.S. - which he has become famous for (<em>House of Flying Daggers</em>).<br>

  Zhang Yimou&rsquo;s beautifully photographed drama about a young woman (Gong Li) who becomes the latest concubine of an old man in 1920's China.

  Humphrey Bogart, in his final role, plays Eddie Willis, a New York sportswriter hired to build up the reputation of a gigantic but unskilled South American fighter named Toro Moreno.  As Moreno&rsquo;s unscrupulous promoter Nick Benko (Rod Steiger) maneuvers him through a series of fixed fights, Willis watches with growing dismay and alarm as the uncomprehending young man nears an undeserved (and unfixed) title shot against reigning heavyweight champ Buddy Brannen, played by real life former champion Max Baer.<br>
  <br>
  The character of Toro Moreno was based on two real life heavyweights: Primo Carnera and Luis Firpo. Carnera, a former circus strongman from Italy, was a huge, powerfully built but awkward fighter who held the heavyweight title for a year before losing to Max Baer, who hammered him to the canvas repeatedly before knocking him out.  Firpo, an Argentine billed as the "Wild Bull of the Pampas," was another giant with little finesse, but a devastating right hand that sent heavyweight champion Jack Dempsey through the ropes in their brief but classic encounter.<br>

  Plus a preview of Tuesday night&rsquo;s main event, another searing look at the dark side of boxing.<br>

<p class = "feature"> The Great Punch-Out: I Coulda&rsquo; Been a Contender!</p>
<p><b> The Set-Up </b>(RKO, 1949).  Dir Robert Wise.  Wrt Art Cohen, inspired by the poem by Joseph Moncure March.  With Robert Ryan, Audrey Totter, George Tobias. Alan Baxter, Wallace Ford, Percy Helton. (72 min, black & white, 35mm)<br>
    <br>
  with:<br>
  <br>
  <b>Casey, Crime Photographer [1951-09-20] </b>(CBS).  Dir Curt Conway.  Wrt Raphael Hayes, based on the character in the "Casey" novels by George Harmon Coxe, and the radio series "Casey, Crime Photographer."  With Darren McGavin, Archie Smith, Maxwell Glanville, Jane White, Louis Sorin. (30 min, black & white, 16mm)<br>
  <br>
  <b>Day of the Fight </b>(RKO, 1951).  Dir Stanley Kubrick.  Wrt Robert Rein.  Narrator Douglas Edwards. (16 min, black & white, 35mm)<br>
  <br>
  In <b>The Set-Up </b>, Robert Ryan, in one of his best roles, plays "Stoker" Thompson, an aging fighter given no chance at all against a young contender.  So why should his crooked cornermen bother telling him that he&rsquo;s supposed to throw the match?  They might have to share their payoff!  The film unfolds round by round, as Thompson gives the untested youngster a brutal boxing lesson and a seething gangster known only as "Little Boy" plots his revenge against the unsuspecting Thompson.  Outside, Thompson&rsquo;s long suffering wife (Audrey Totter) paces the grimy streets of the ironically named tank town "Paradise City."<br>
  <br>
  Preceded by <b>Day of the Fight </b>and an episode of <b>Casey, Crime Photographer </b>.<br>
  <br>
  It&rsquo;s April 17th, 1950, and young middleweight Walter Cartier will fight Bobby James in New York tonight.  The camera follows Walter (and his twin brother Vincent) through his day as he prepares for his 10:00 P.M. bout.  After eating breakfast, going to early mass and eating lunch, he starts arranging his things for the fight at 4:00 P.M.  By 8:00, he is waiting in his dressing room, where he undergoes a mental transformation, turning into the fighting machine the crowd clamors for. <b>Day of the Fight </b>, part of RKO&rsquo;s <em>This is America</em> series, was one of the first filmmaking efforts of Stanley Kubrick, a staff photographer for "Look" magazine who had photographed Cartier for a 1949 pictorial entitled "Prizefighter."<br>
  <br>
  Darren McGavin inherited the role of Casey, crime photographer for the "Morning Express" newspaper, when the popular radio series was brought to television for a short run.  In this episode, Casey gets involved with an African-American contender threatened with violence if he does not agree in advance to lose a fight.<br>

<p class = "feature"> The Great Punch-Out: Sweet Sugar, the Sweetest Fighter Pound for Pound</p>
<p><b> Sugar Ray Robinson--Pound for Pound </b>(Big Fights, 1977).  Dir Jim Jacobs.  Narrators Norman Rose, Kevin Kennedy. (99 min, color/black & white, 16mm)<br>
    <br>
  with:<br>
  <br>
  <b>Sugar Ray Robinson versus Jake LaMotta for the Middleweight Championship, February 14, 1951, Chicago, Illinois </b>(Big Fights, 1952). (31 min, black & white,16mm)<br>
  <br>
  <b>Robinson-Turpin Fight </b>(RKO, 1951). (19 min, black & white, 35mm)<br>
  <br>
  By most reckonings, Sugar Ray Robinson was the greatest "pound for pound" fighter that the ring has ever seen.  Jim Jacobs&rsquo;s documentary traces his 25 year career from the beginnings through his multiple reigns as welterweight and middleweight champion, with classic footage of Kid Gavilan, Carmen Basilio, Gene Fullmer and many others.<br>
  <br>
  <em>"I fought Sugar Ray Robinson so many time I got diabetes!"</em> &ndash; Jake LaMotta<br>
  Sugar Ray Robinson and Jake LaMotta fought five times in 1940s, with each fight ending in a close decision.  In 1951, both men were at the top of their game, and LaMotta held the middleweight title that Robinson sought.  In their sixth fight, there would be no decision but a knockout brawl, and the match would be forever known as "The St. Valentine&rsquo;s Day Massacre."<br>
  <br>
  Robinson toured Europe in 1951, defeating a string of second rate opponents who gave him little trouble.  In England, however, he faced the unheralded Randy Turpin, a first rate opponent who gave him nothing but trouble.  This fight proved to be on of the toughest and fiercest in the long and illustrious career of the Sugar man.<br>

<p class = "feature"> The Great Punch-Out: Float like a Butterfly: Sting like Ali</p>
<p><b> A. K. A. Cassius Clay </b>(Sports of the Century/United Artists, 1970).  Dir Jim Jacobs.  Wrt Bernard Evslin.  With Muhammad Ali, Cus D'Amato.  Narrator Richard Kiley. (79 min, black & white/color, 35mm)<br>
    <br>

  <b>Cassius Clay versus Zigzy Pietrzykowski, 1960 Olympic Light-Heavyweight Championship, Rome, Italy </b>(Big Fights, 1978). (11 min, black & white, 16mm)<br>
  <br>
  <b>Fight of the Champions [Excerpt] </b>(Perenchio - California Sports, 1971). (ca. 15 min, color, 35mm)<br>
  <br>
  After refusing induction into the Army at the height of the Vietnam War, Muhammad Ali was stripped of his title and banned from fighting for three years.  While he fought his battle in the courts, there was time to make <b>A. K. A. Cassius Clay </b>, a memorable documentary of his early career, incorporating footage of his early fights, including his 1964 "knockout" of all four Beatles in Miami, Florida!<br>
  <br>
  Rome, 1960. The sporting world gets its first glimpse of a new kind of fighter, as Cassius Clay of Louisville, Kentucky defeats Poland&rsquo;s Ziggy Pietrzkowski for the Light-Heavyweight Olympic gold medal. Rare film footage of Ali&rsquo;s Olympic fight for which there are those who say that at this time the young Cassius Clay had the fastest hands ever in boxing history; check and see for yourself.<br>
  <br>
  The first Ali/Frazier fight is considered by many the greatest heavyweight fight of all time.  It&rsquo;s legend only grows as the years go by as does the reputation of the two fighters who fought their hearts out in front of so many at Madison Square Garden in New York City.  Muhammad Ali would not have achieved the greatness he so craved if it were not for his three battles with Smokin&rsquo; Joe Frazier, his greatest adversary. It has been mostly forgotten that Frazier was favored to win this fight going in because Ali had a long forced layoff protesting the Vietnam War.  You will see the last rounds of the fight when Joe Frazier starts to take over with his power and tenacity and then connects with one of the hardest left hooks ever to Ali&rsquo;s chin sending him down for the first loss of his career. The fragment originates from 35mm film footage of the fight held as part of the Library&rsquo;s Copyright Collection.<br>

<p class = "feature"> The Great Punch-Out: The Greatest Heavyweight Fights of the 20th Century</p>
<p><b> The Official Motion Pictures of the Heavyweight Boxing Contest between Gene Tunney-Heavyweight Champion of the World and Jack Dempsey-Contender for the Heavyweight Championship of the World </b>(Tex Rickard, 1927). (9 min, black & white, 35mm)<br>
    <br>
  In 1926, Gene Tunney outfought, out-thought and out-pointed Jack Dempsey to win the heavyweight championship.  A year later, a determined Dempsey faced Tunney again in a bout forever remembered for the "long count" that the floored Tunney was given when Dempsey refused to go to a neutral corner.  How long was it? Come and see!  This classic fight film footage was restored by the Library of Congress from original nitrate elements..<br>
  <br>
  <b>Joe Louis versus Tony Galento for the Heavyweight Championship, New York City, June 28, 1939 </b>(Turn of the Century Fights, 1967). (2 min, black & white, 16mm)<br>
  <br>
  "I&rsquo;ll moida da bum" declared Tony "Two Ton" Galento when he signed to fight Joe Louis for the heavyweight championship, and for a few fleeting seconds after he managed to knock Louis to the floor, it looked like he&rsquo;d be as good as his word.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Joe Louis versus Buddy Baer for the Heavyweight Championship of the World, May 23, 1941, Washington, D.C. </b>(Big Fights, 1979). (11 min, black & white, 16mm)<br>
  <br>
  On his way to the title in the 1930s, Joe Louis handily defeated former champion Max Baer.  By 1941, Max&rsquo;s younger but bigger brother Buddy was ready for his turn, and squared off against the champion in Washington, DC&rsquo;s Griffith Stadium.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Joe Louis vs Billy Conn for the Heavyweight Championship of the World, June 18, 1941, New York City </b>(Big Fights, 1966). (30 min, black & white, 16mm)<br>
  <br>
  In 1941, Light Heavyweight champion Billy Conn stepped up in weight and class to challenge Joe Louis for the heavyweight crown.  The result was one of the greatest matches of all time.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Rocky Marciano versus Joe Louis, October 26, 1951, New York City </b>(Big Fights, 1954). (11 min, black & white, 16mm)<br>
  <br>
  <b>Rocky Marciano vs. Jersey Joe Walcott for the Heavyweight Championship of the World, September 23, 1952, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania </b>(Big Fights, 1952). (21 min, black & white, 16mm)<br>
  <br>
  <b>Rocky Marciano versus Archie Moore for the Heavyweight Championship of the World, September 21, 1955, New York City </b>(Big Fights, 1955). (19 min, black & white, 16mm)<br>
  <br>
  In October, 1951 Rocky Marciano made headlines when he ended former champion Joe Louis&rsquo;s attempt at a comeback with a decisive knockout.  Eleven months later he faced champion Jersey Joe Walcott, one of Louis&rsquo; toughest opponents and a fighter with considerably more experience.  In one of the greatest title matches ever, Marciano weathered a first round knockdown and Walcott&rsquo;s full arsenal of trick moves and tough punches, finally delivering one of boxing&rsquo;s greatest knockout blows in what he would call his "lucky" thirteenth round.  In his next to last title defense, Marciano took on one of the ring&rsquo;s cleverest tacticians, the "Old Mongoose" Archie Moore.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Joe Frazier, Champion, versus George Foreman, Challenger for the Heavyweight Championship of the World, Kingston, Jamaica, January 22, 1973 </b>(Big Fights, 1973). (11 min, black & white, 16mm)<br>
  <br>
  After his historic defeat of Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier took it easy for a couple of years by fighting against second rate opponents - then he met George Foreman.  Two of the hardest punching heavyweights of all time squared off for the first and only time and something had to give.  Very few could believe that Smokin&rsquo; Joe Frazier would get rocked so hard and so fast but he did get up each time.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Muhammad Ali versus Henry Cooper for the Heavyweight Championship of the World, London, England, May 21, 1966 </b>(Greatest Fights of the Century, 1973). (10 min, black & white, 16mm)<br>
  <br>
  <b>Muhammad Ali (Cassius Clay) versus Cleveland Williams for the Heavyweight Championship of the World, Astrodome, Houston, Texas, November 14, 1966 </b>(Big Fights, 1966). (11 min, color, 16mm)<br>
  <br>
  Two of Ali&rsquo;s Championship defenses. First, against England&rsquo;s Henry Cooper, who had floored him with a sharp left hook in their first meeting. In the second match, Ali outwits and declaws Cleveland "Big Cat" Williams.<br>
