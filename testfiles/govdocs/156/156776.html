	  <p class="chaptertitle">Personal Hearing Protection Devices</p>
	  <p>A personal hearing protection device (or &quot;hearing protector&quot;) is anything
that can be worn to reduce the level of sound entering the ear. Earmuffs, ear canal caps,
and earplugs are the three principal types of devices. Each employee reacts individually
to the use of these devices, and a successful hearing loss prevention program should be
able to respond to the needs of each employee. Making sure these devices protect hearing
effectively requires the coordinated effort of management, the hearing loss prevention
program operators, and the affected employees. </p>
	<p>OSHA's requirements for hearing protectors are summarized as items no. 31-38 and 51 in
	  <a href="appA.html">Appendix A</a> of this document. Useful guidance can also be found in <a href="appB.html">Appendix B</a>, in the
	  section entitled &quot;Hearing Protection Devices.&quot;</p>
	
	<p class="paragraph">Management Responsibilities</p>
	<p>Management has two roles in ensuring that hearing protection devices protect hearing
	  effectively: facilitation and enforcement. Facilitation involves ensuring that program
	  implementors obtain the types of devices they need. Management can do this by making sure
	  the procurement department does not override the implementor's selections. Management must
	  demonstrate its commitment to a truly effective hearing protection program, not one that
	  exists just to comply with OSHA regulations. Employee participation in the selection of
	  hearing protectors should be encouraged. Encouragement might take the form of providing
	  safety-related bonuses (e.g., home/auto fire extinguisher, first aid kits, smoke alarms)
	  as a &quot;reward&quot; for employees who use protection regularly and properly, and for <em>supervisors</em> who energetically support hearing protection policies. Management should extend its
	  commitment to hearing protectors by requiring all personnel, including managers and
	  visitors, to wear protectors in designated areas, and by encouraging employees to take
	  hearing protectors home to use whenever engaging in noisy activities. </p>
	<p>Management should give program implementors the opportunity to pilot-test hearing
	  protectors on a few employees. This will greatly facilitate decisions relating to the
	  selection and ultimate effectiveness of these devices. Hearing loss prevention program
	  implementors should also be provided with resources and facilities to train employees in
	  the use and care of hearing protectors.</p>
	<p>Enforcing the use of hearing protectors is management's second vital role. Use of
	  personal safety equipment, such as hearing protectors, must be clearly stated as a
	  condition of employment, and management should be prepared to deal accordingly with those
	  who violate the policy. Those who have decided not to wearing hearing protection in noisy
	  areas also have decided not to work for the company.</p>
	
	<p class="paragraph">Program Implementor Responsibilities</p>
	<p>It is essential to the success of the program to have someone responsible for the
	  selection of hearing protection devices and the supervision of their use. They must be
	  able to evaluate and select appropriate devices for each employee, based on proper fit,
	  the employee's noise exposure, hearing ability, communication needs, personal preferences
	  and other constraints imposed by job tasks or work environment. Not every person can wear
	  every hearing protector. Some people may be unable to wear certain types of earplugs
	  because of the shape or size of their ear canals. Because of individual differences in the
	  shapes and sizes of heads, some people will be unable to wear some earmuffs. Individual
	  assessment of comfort and ability to tolerate prolonged use of a given device cannot be
	  predicted and will vary widely between individuals. Also, some protectors may be
	  incompatible with other safety and protective devices. Therefore, program implementors
	  must make a variety of devices available. Preferably, program implementors should make
	  available a set of devices that have been pilot-tested for effectiveness and employee
	  acceptance. When fitting hearing protectors, attention needs to be given to each ear. It
	  is not uncommon for a person to have right and left ear canals that are different sizes
	  and must therefore be fitted with earplugs that are separately sized for each ear. Ear
	  canals should be inspected to assure that no physical problems, such as infections or
	  excessive ear wax, will compromise or complicate the use of hearing protectors.</p>

	  Program implementors must be able to educate employees one-on-one about the proper use
        and care of hearing protectors. They must be sure that each employee can demonstrate
        competence in fitting and using the protector, and is familiar with replacement
        procedures. Program implementors should also encourage employees to ask questions and to
      seek help in resolving problems. </p>
      <p>Another important aspect of a successful program is to perform on-site checks of the
        condition of the protectors, noting misuse or wearer &quot;modification&quot; that would
        diminish effectiveness of the protectors. Program implementors should have a ready supply
        of replacement protectors, and be prepared to work with those employees whose negative
        attitudes prevent them from using these devices properly and routinely. In an environment
        where a safety culture has been established, peer pressure in favor of protector use can
        be effective in helping to resolve these problems. </p>
      <p>Program implementors should be alert for common pitfalls associated with use and care
        of hearing protectors. For example, motorcycle helmets, personal stereo headsets, swimmers
        earplugs, and hearing aids cannot be substituted for hearing protectors. Program
        implementors should be proactive in working with employees to avoid such pitfalls. </p>
      
	  <p class="paragraph">Employee Responsibilities</p>
	  <p>Employees, of course, are the focus of the hearing protection program, and must make
        efforts to be fully informed, to obtain help when necessary, and to assume responsibility
        for wearing their hearing protectors. Whenever the employee must work in hazardous noise,
        the employee becomes the first line of defense against hearing loss. Employees must
        consciously develop personal habits and strategies for wearing their hearing protection.
        Otherwise, it becomes too easy to succumb to the constant barrage of opportunities to
        misuse personal hearing protectors, thereby risking exposure to harmful levels of noise.</p>

      <p>How employees utilize personal hearing protection has a critical impact on hearing loss
        prevention. They must recognize the importance of wearing their hearing protector whenever
        they are exposed to hazardous noise. Wearing their hearing protector at all times simply
        cannot be overemphasized. As the <a href="#graph">graph</a> on page 39 illustrates, removing a hearing
        protector for only a few minutes can dramatically reduce its effectiveness. Following
        manufacturers' instructions and wearing their hearing protector correctly is just as
        important as wearing their hearing protector consistently. To achieve the maximum benefit,
        employees <strong>must</strong> make sure they wear their protectors correctly. The <a href="#chart1">bar
        charts</a> on page 40 compare the Noise Reduction Rating hearing protectors can theoretically
        provide with the hearing protection employees typically obtain in the &quot;real
        world&quot; (Berger, Franks and Lindgren, 1994). The differences between the maximum
        protection theoretically possible, and the protection usually obtained in the &quot;real
        world&quot; are influenced by many factors. An employee's failure to correctly insert an
        earplug or adjust an earmuff, are arguably the chief culprits responsible for diminished
        real world hearing protection. Thus, even if an employee has been issued a correctly-sized
        hearing protector, and has been trained in its use and care, it is quite possible that he
        or she could receive little or no effective hearing protection because of faulty fit.
        Employees must resolve to wear their hearing protection correctly or they will greatly
      reduce its ability to prevent harmful noise from damaging their hearing. </p>
      <p>Willful failure to wear hearing protection should be taken seriously. Employees should
        consider that management is responsible for ensuring compliance with health and safety
        requirements. Should employees fail to wear their hearing protection, management can be
        held accountable and may be cited and penalized for noncompliance with health and safety
        regulations. </p>
      <p>Part of the employees' responsibility toward wearing their hearing protector is to
        cultivate a vigilant attitude about hearing protection. Employees should expect their
        hearing protectors to slip or work lose over a period of time. Throughout their work
        shift, employees must periodically check to see if they need to readjust or refit their
        protector in order to maintain a reliable fit. </p>
      <p>Hearing protectors break and become worn. Employees also need to check their protector
        regularly and to seek repair or replacement whenever necessary. Lastly, they can help each
        other by encouraging their co-workers to use hearing protectors and to seek help when they
        have problems. </p>
      <p>Employees must guard against acquiring a false sense of safety. As the discussion and
        figures in this section have illustrated, it is easy to misuse hearing protectors and
        greatly reduce their effectiveness. Employees <strong>CAN</strong> prevail over most hearing health
        hazards if they: 1) properly wear their hearing protectors, 2) exercise a commitment to
        wear their hearing protectors consistently, and 3) maintain their hearing protectors by
        repairing or replacing them when necessary.</p>
