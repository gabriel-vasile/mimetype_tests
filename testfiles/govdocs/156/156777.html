<P ALIGN="center">Ritual</P>

<P>Regardless of the nature of ceremonials among the Pueblos, their
times, places, and purposes, there are certain elements which display a
degree of constancy, recurring again and again in household or personal
observances as well as in society functions and elaborate communal
ceremonies. These elements are ritual practises, following more or less
stereotyped forms, varying somewhat from Pueblo to Pueblo, yet
everywhere fundamentally the same. They are used over and over again in
a bewildering variety of combinations. Ceremonies which at first glance
have nothing in common, either in purpose or external appearance, upon
analysis reveal an underlying similarity in that each displays a
fundamentally similar basic pattern into which these ritual "blocks"
have been fitted, often in entirely different order. It is at least
theoretically possible to have two entirely different ceremonies in
which the details are identical, the differences lying entirely in the
different combination of elements. It is this factor alone which renders
Pueblo ceremonialism in any degree comprehensible. Without these
elements of coherence, the variability would be too great for human
comprehension. (Parsons, 1924.)</P>

<P><U>Fetishes</U>: First of importance in the rituals are the fetishes.
The most significant class are the perfect ears of corn which usually
represent the Earth Mother. These may be hollowed out and filled with
typical seeds of squash, melon, beans, ste., and usually are elaborately
dressed with feathers and beads. In this form they will be used by heads
of ceremonial groups, clan heads, town chiefs, or may be possessed by
individual society members. Plain and unadorned the perfect ear may
protect the pregnant woman and the newborn child from witchcraft, or may
be placed upon the heart of the dead. There are also stone fetish
animals, crude representations of those animals which are considered
endowed with supernatural power, particularly mountain lion for hunting,
bear for curing. The war gods have stone or wooden images. Carved or
uncarved stones of odd shapes or qualities may have fetishistic
significance. So, too, may certain masks. All fetishistic articles must
be kept carefully wrapped or placed in bundles, should not be looked at
by the uninitiated, and should be ritually fed (with corn meal) by their
custodians.</P>

<P><U>Shrines</U>: All the Pueblo make use of shrines which are usually
stones set in some particular spot, often in semi-circular form with
some of the stones upright, sometimes merely piles of stones. Certain
springs and unusual natural formations are also treated as shrines. Many
of these shrines have a particular character, i. e., they are used to
make offerings for some specific purpose. Others are more general. Many
have a "road" leading out from them, a cleared trail by which the
spirits are supposed to approach the shrine. Offerings at shrines
consist of meal, prayer feathers or prayer sticks, and ritual cigarettes
of cane filled with tobacco. (Parsons, 1929b, pp. 238-241, 1925a, p.
104; Dumarest, p. 207; White, 1932, 1932a; Goldfrank, 1927.)</P>

<P><U>Altar, Road Medicine Bowl</U>: Altars are made by various
societies and certain religious functionaries such as the town chief.
The altar varies according to the group making it and the occasion. A
curing society which was performing weather control ceremonial would
make a different type of altar than when it was functioning as a caring
society.</P>

<P>Certain ritual patterns and representations are drawn upon the ground
by sprinkling colored cornmeal, charcoal, and colored sands. These
representations include clouds, lightning representations, or various
supernaturals including the Water Serpent or Horned Serpent. Some of
these things may be represented on a wooden frame forming a back and
sometimes wings to the altar. These altars, usually referred to as slat
altars, are limited in the east largely to the western Keres and to rain
making ceremonies. Foremost in importance is the laying out of
appropriate fetishes and it is their proper arrangement as much as
anything which constitutes the altar. Upon the ground altar is also
placed a medicine bowl which plays a part in every ceremony, a ritual
bowl filled with water in which certain herbs have been steeped
according to the formula called for by the occasion. In addition there
are feathers, gourds filled with water, from sacred springs, and various
offerings such as meal, cooked food, prayer feathers or sticks, perhaps
miniature objects such as games which are associated with certain
supernatural beings. From the altar leads a meal line, often clear to
the door of the room, which is considered the "road" and is believed to
be the actual path to be used by the spirits in visiting the altar. The
making of the meal line is a distinctive characteristic of many
ceremonies; the kachina dancers, for example, may follow a meal line
sprinkled before them. (Parsons, 1924, 1929b, (p. 252), 1923d, 1925a,
(p. 119), 1920a, (p. 60), 1932; White, 1932, 1932a.)</P>

<P><U>Offerings</U>: The paramount offering is corn meal. Sometimes
ground shell or turquoise is substituted. It is offered on every
conceivable occasion, usually sprinkled from the fingers, when prayers
are said, on the head and person of individuals, on sacred objects of
any sort, or on altars and shrines.</P>

<P>Next in importance, perhaps, are feathers and prayer sticks. Feathers
may sometimes be offered loose, but generally they are tied ritually in
certain specified fashions for various supernaturals and occasions. They
are also a part of the prayer stick. The prayer stick is made in almost
infinite variety of forms, each one associated with a particular purpose
or supernatural. The prayer stick is cut or carved, usually painted, and
has feathers of different kinds attached to it in specified ways. No
adequate summary of the types can be given pending the publication of a
detailed analysis.</P>

<P>The prayer stick seems closely associated with the masked kachina
cult. Its use is most strongly developed where the sacred mask cult is
at its greatest efflorescence; it declines in importance as the mask
cult declines, and disappears in Taos where there are no masked dances.
Prayer feathers, on the other hand, have a distribution beyond that of
the masked kachina dances and are probably an earlier form. In some
towns the right to make prayer sticks belongs to special ceremonial
officials, and a layman wishing a prayer stick to offer for some purpose
takes corn meal and materials to the proper person in order to have the
prayer stick made. In any case, certain prayer sticks are identified
with specific societies and officials, and would not be made by a person
not entitled to make them. To do so would, of course, be quite pointless
in Indian point of view, for an improper offering would not be received,
although it is doubtful if any bad effect is believed to threaten in
such a case.</P>

<P>Smoking is frequently, but not always, a form of offering. The smoke
is blown as a present to the supernaturals. Offerings of tobacco,
particularly in the ritual form of tobacco wrapped in corn husk or cane
cigarettes, are important, and offerings of corn meal between
individuals have a compulsive character. It is virtually impossible to
refuse a legitimate request, whether it be to help with housebuilding,
or to bring the medicine society of which one is a member to cure a sick
person, if it be accompanied by these ritually important presents.
Indeed, the offerings, when made to the supernaturals seem to have a
compulsive character and one finds in the literature statements that the
spirits "have to help us" because certain offerings have been made.</P>

<P>Food is a customary offering but seems to be restricted to particular
occasions. Food is usually offered to the dead or to the earth by
throwing a bit into the fire before eating. Food may be placed on
shrines or altars on special occasions.</P>

<P>Paint pigments sometimes form sacred offerings. (Parsons, 1923d,
1924, 1929b, 1925a; White, 1932, pp. 125-131, 1932a; Goldfrank,
1927.)</P>

<P><U>Ritual Actions</U>: Certain widespread and rather stereotyped
actions accompany most ceremonials. Offerings, smoking; certain
movements of the hands are usually made to the cardinal directions
(which usually include zenith and nadir). Water is sprink led or given
to drink from the medicine bowl. Feathers are brushed over patients in
curing, along house walls to purify houses, dipped in the medicine bowl
and people sprinkled with the medicine water. One breathes from a
ceremonial or sacrosanct object, obtaining thus some of the virtue
inherent in it.</P>

<P>Bathing is a preliminary to many ceremonials. It precedes adoption
and initiation rites, and follows ceremonies. Hair washing in particular
is practised, the head being bathed in yucca suds by a person who stands
in some special social or ceremonial relation to the subject. It is
ubiquitous in the west; less so on the Rio Grande. Fasting is observed
in connection with ceremonial periods. This varies from merely eating
lightly and abstaining from various foods to almost complete fasting.
Continence is particularly important before undertaking any action of
ceremonial significance. Ceremonialists, impersonators of masked
dancers, society members, and a few others, are usually confined to the
kiva or to a ceremonial chamber for a period of four days preceding a
ceremonial event. (Parsons, 1924, 1925a, 1920, 1920a, 1929b, pp.
254-260, 1932; Goldfrank, 1927; White, 1932, 1932a.)</P>

<P ALIGN="center">Ceremonial Organization</P>

<P><U>Town Chiefs</U>: Head of the ceremonial organization in all Pueblo
towns of the east is the town chief. At Isleta the town chief is the
source of all ceremonial life; he gives permission for all ceremonies,
asks for certain ceremonies, and conducts the winter rain ceremonies. He
keeps the sacrosanct supplies, native grown tobacco and cotton,
flint-made fire, etc. He may not kill the animals used in his rituals,
nor may his assistant. He has a corn mother fetish which is considered
the mother of all the fetishes of the town. His land is cultivated for
him and his wood chopped. Two women are appointed to care for his
ceremonial house and to feed the scalps of which he is custodian. He has
two assistant town chiefs who have a distinctive ritual of their own to
perform. His first assistant is called the war chief at times. He talks
differently, i. e., mentions the corner directions instead of the ritual
cardinal directions, refers in prayers to snow, hail, scalps and other
unpleasant things which other ceremonialists do not mention. He gets his
power from the homed serpent; he handles snakes and is prominent in
racing rituals and witchfinding. The second assistant is called the Bow
Chief and the guardian of the War Thief. He is custodian of a ritually
used blade about one foot long.</P>

<P>This sketch gives an idea of the importance of the town chief and his
assistants. There are minor variations but in broad terms the picture
might be applied to any of the Pueblos of the Rio Grande so far as the
position of the town chief is concerned. Generally it is the town chief
who names or nominates all the secular officials and who dictates their
actions while they are in office. He is in effect a Priest-Chief from
whom springs all authority and all religious ceremonial.</P>

<P>The Tewa have a somewhat similar organization with two assistants who
are called right-hand and left-hand men. The principle of succession is
for the right-hand man to succeed the town chief, the left-hand man to
succeed the right-hand man, and for a new appointee to fill the office
of left-hand man, the same principle being followed at Isleta and Jemez.
At Jemez, however, the principle of clanship enters the ceremonial
picture for the first time, because the town chieftainship group must
always be of the Young Corn or of the Sun Clan.</P>

<P>In contrast to the entry of the clan principle at Jemez, the Tewa are
governed by the moiety principle, which has no social implications as
does the clan. Among the Tewa the moiety looms so importantly that there
are two entire sets of town chiefs (and other officials) who belong to
the two moieties and are classified as summer and winter people. During
a relatively short winter period the Tewa Pueblos are ruled by the
winter people and the Winter Chiefs; during the somewhat longer summer
period, the villagers are ruled by the summer people. This exchange of
functions appear in the ceremonial life in that the ceremonies of
transfer are more important among the Tewa than is the solstice,
elsewhere the all-important central point of the ceremonial life.</P>

<P>Among the Keres the town chief is not dual as among the Tewa, but
another important principle appears. The town chief is frequently
associated with the Giant curing society. Often he must be a member of
or be named by this society. His two assistants may be distributed among
the other important societies, as at San Felipe where his two assistants
must be members of Flint and Kwirena (no translation) societies. Among
the western Keres, particularly Acoma, the town chief must again be of a
particular clan, the Antelope clan.</P>

<P>Another important function of the town chief which does not appear
among the Tewa to any great extent, is to "watch the sun". Many of the
important ceremonies, especially of the Keresans, are fixed by
observation of the rising and setting point of the sun. This is
particularly true of the solstice ceremonies which loom importantly in
the Keresan ceremonial calendar.</P>

<P>In addition to the town chief there are various other important
ceremonial officials. Perhaps next in rank are the heads of the medicine
societies. These require extended discussion and will be taken up later.
There is generally a hunt chief, often the head of a hunting society,
and there is or once was (in many Pueblos it is extinct) a war society,
usually composed of men who have slain an enemy and taken a scalp. The
chief of the war society was probably once a very important personage,
as much priest as war leader. At some Pueblos, notably Cochiti, where
the office become extinct since Dumarest's time, i. e., within a
generation or so, there is evidence that the war priest or chief was the
ranking officer of the village rather than the town chief. The place of
the war chief is now filled by the annually appointed war captains,
probably originally the police officials of the Spanish secular village
government, who now act as the executors of the town chief's orders,
police ceremonies, enforce observances of the necessary rituals in
conservative towns, and apprehend, try, and punish witches.</P>

<P>At Isleta there are chiefs of the moieties, which means they are also
chiefs of the kivas and of the clown societies, all three being
identical in membership. There are also the Grandfathers, life-long
masked clown performers associated with the moieties, and a male and a
female kachina organization chief. Finally there are the ritual corn
groups, which are rain making societies, each with a chief and usually
some assistants who perform distinctive rituals.</P>

<P>The Tewa have in addition the chiefs of the clown societies and their
assistants as ceremonial leaders.</P>

<P>The Jemez likewise have chiefs of the clown societies who perform
rituals along with the old men of the societies.</P>

<P>Some of the Keresans also have additional ceremonial officers. San
Felipe has heads for the kivas connected with the kachina organization.
At Cochiti there are three "managing" societies which have special
functions in connection with the ceremonial life, generally taking care
of the more esoteric societies. (Parsons, 1920, 1920a, 1923c, 1923d,
1924, 1925a, 1929b, 1932; White, 1932, 1932a; Goldfrank, 1927.)</P>

<P><U>Kachina Cult and Societies</U>: The kachina cult in all the well
known Pueblos, except possibly Taos, is always a tribal society; that
is, all the men belong to it. Usually there is a chief to the kachina
group or groups. Tewa kachina groups seem vaguely formulated and the
data are not clear whether it is a real tribal society, although an
initiation ritual with whipping is reported. For Jemez, data are
similarly unsatisfactory; possibly the kachina group is the same as the
two men's societies of all-inclusive membership. Cochiti has a single
kachina society to which all men belong. The head of the kachina was
formerly the war priest. San Felipe has three groups of kachina, two
associated with the two kivas, the third with a mask house. Laguna
organization again is obscure. At Acoma the kachina are associated with
the kivas, and kiva initiation is initiation into the secrets of the
kachina.</P>

<P>The kachina are divided into many classes, as expressed in the masks
and costumes worn by impersonators. Of some of the classes there are
believed to be only one or two. Others are in "sets" of fixed number. Of
other types of kachina there are believed to be an unlimited number and
there is no limit to the number which may appear at a dance. The masks
are usually of hide, formerly of buckskin or buffalo hide, but now
usually made of cow hide. A collar of spruce, foxskin, or other material
is worn with most masks and there are varying and elaborate details in
the costume. The kachina are also divided into dancing kachinas and
non-dancing, the latter being usually of those classes which are limited
in number and which more or less police the dances.</P>

<P>The function of the kachina is to produce rain by dancing. On the Rio
Grande, the kachinas dance for one day after any rain ceremony, but most
particularly after the rain retreats of the medicine societies. At Acoma
there is an exception, the great occasion of the kachina being a
four-day summer rain dance with no dances after society retreats.
(Parsons, 1920a, 1923c, 1923d, 1925a, 1929b, 1932; Dumarest; White,
1932, 1932a.)</P>

<P><U>Medicine Societies</U>: The medicine societies are secret
organizations of medicine men or shamans, the chief function of which is
curing disease. In addition they are important as rain makers and among
the Keresans play an indispensable part in the solstice ceremonies. They
play a part at birth and death usually, and political control is largely
in their hands through their function of advising the town chief.</P>

<P>There is apparently considerable variation in the various towns, but
if one considers the societies which are sub-orders of other societies
in certain towns, the two virtually universal societies in all the
Pueblos are Flint and Fire. In addition nearly all the Keresan villages
have Giant and <U>Shikame</U> (no translation). Another universal
society is the Snake society, but this is so specialized in nature that
it is not a true curing society. Other widely occurring, but not
universal societies are Eagle, Ant, and, among the Keresans, Lightning
or Thunder Cloud and <U>K'apina</U> (no translation).</P>

<P>The various societies may be divided into "schools" of medical
practise. Most important are those which specialize in witch-caused
diseases. The Snake group specializes in the curing of snake bite and at
some of the Pueblos is not a formally organized medicine society, but
merely a loose aggregation of individuals who have bean snake bitten and
thereafter are believed to be able to cure snake bite. Lightning, among
the Keresans, cures lightning shock, broken bones, and "bad smells in
the stomach." The Ant school is based on the idea that ants cause such
ailments as certain skin diseases, sore throat, etc., by entering the
body, and must be extracted, usually by brushing with eagle plumes.</P>

<P>The majority of illnesses are caused by witches sending foreign
objects into the victim or stealing his heart. If a person is ill, the
father or a relative of the patient takes a handful of meal to the
medicine man desired, or to the head of a society if the illness is
serious and the presence of the entire society is desired. If only one
doctor comes, he smokes, sings, mixes medicines in a bowl of water, puts
ashes on his hands and massages the patient, and sucks out any foreign
object located. If a society is summoned, it usually spends four days in
retreat in the society house, fasting, using emetics, and exercising
continence. Should the case be serious, of course this preparatory
period will be omitted. Then it spends three nights smoking, singing and
praying over the patient in his house, performing the final curing
ceremony the fourth night.</P>

<P>The paraphernalia are elaborate. A meal altar or meal painting is
made, upon which, and before which, are laid the corn-ear fetishes each
member usually possesses, stone figures of the war gods, of Paiyatymo,
(a sun spirit), of lions, bears, badgers, etc., and, among Keresans,
images of the Kobishtaiya, a group of ill-defined spirits dwelling in
the east. Medicine bowls, skins of the forelegs of bears, flints, eagle
plumes, rattles, and other objects are used. A rock crystal is usually
employed by the head doctor, and sometimes the others gaze into it to
gain second sight, being able to see witches, etc. Roads of meal are
drawn on the floor from the door to the fetish animals on the altar, for
it is from the spirits of these animals that the medicine men gain their
curing power. Their ritual is in large measure the summoning of these
animal spirits to their assistance in the curing.</P>

<P>The medicine men wear only a breechcloth. Their faces are painted red
and they wear a line of white bird-down over the head from ear to ear.
Songs are sung, people are exhorted to believe in the medicine men,
water is poured into the medicine bowl from the six directions, and each
doctor puts some herbs in the bowl. They rub their hands with ashes and
massage the patient. They suck out objects from the patient's body and,
by gazing in the crystal or the medicine bowl, they see witches. During
a curing ceremony witches are believed to gather about the house to
thwart the success of the cure and they are even asserted to sometimes
rap on the door. Consequently the war captain and his assistant guard
the house, standing outside the door during the curing rituals, because,
they have power over witches. They carry a bow and arrow, because a
rifle would not injure a witch.</P>

<P>If the doctors decide the heart has been stolen by a witch, they try
to bring it back. This usually means fighting with the witches. They go
armed with flint knives, wear a bear paw on the left forearm, a bear
claw necklace, and a whistle of bear bone. The war chief and his guards
attempt to follow the doctors to protect them but often it is
impossible, for the doctors have been known to leave the ground and fly
through the air. The fights with the witches are strenuous and
realistic. Sometimes the witches tie the hair of two or three of the
doctors together or a doctor will be found on the ground tied up with
wire. The witches attempt to overcome the doctors by blowing their
breath, which has an unbearable odor, at them.</P>

<P>Sometimes the doctors capture a witch. It is usually man like in
shape and about a foot and a half high or higher, or it may be in the
shape of some animal. Often it looks like a <U>koshare</U> clown. The
witch is brought into the house, placed before the fireplace, and the
war chief shoots it with bow and arrow, after which the body is burned.
The doctors frequently return smeared with blood or "black" after a
fight and also fall in trances or spasms upon their return.</P>

<P>Even though the witch is not captured, the medicine men usually
return with the heart, a ball of rags within which are one or four
grains of corn. The patient is given the grain to swallow. When the
ceremony is over, and all present have been given medicine to drink,
food is brought out and eaten, first by the medicine men, then by the
others present. The medicine men are given baskets of meal and flour in
payment for their services.</P>

<P>Most of the Rio Grande Pueblos hold a comnunal curing ceremony in
February or March in which all the medicine societies of each Pueblo
participate. They are held at the direction of the town chief or the war
chief and each society meets in its own chamber at the same time. The
paraphernalia and ritual are the same as for ordinary curing ceremonies.
Most of the inhabitants of the Pueblo visit one or another of the
ceremonial chambers and are "cured" indiscriminately. Objects are
extracted from their bodies and they are given medicine to drink. Witch
fighting and the recovery of a communal heart sometimes occur.</P>

<P>Membership in the societies is for life. Both men and women become
members but only the men perform cures. Children also may join if
thought old enough to keep the secrets. There is a head man or "father"
of the society, usually the oldest and most experienced member, who
calls meetings, directs ceremonies, and performs some special duties.
Doctors have their power entirely as the result of their membership in
the society; medicine power is never the possession of individuals as
such.</P>

<P>The most approved method of joining a society is by becoming a member
after having been cured of an illness. Occasionally someone may apply
for membership. A third way, used only in a few towns, is by "trapping".
A person who violates some ceremonial rule, e. g., building a fire
outdoors during the initiation period, is forcibly initiated.</P>

<P>Little is known about initiations as they are entirely secret. No
member of a medicine society has ever consented to act as an informant
or reveal the secrets of his society. There is a term of training,
usually through a period of years, in which the novice is trained in
prayers, songs, ritual, feats of magic, medicines, etc. Some non-members
think novices are subjected to physical torture and possibly filthy
rites. The final episode in the initiation is a public ritual in the
ceremonial chamber of the society in which the new member shows off his
powers. At this time he is presented with the corn ear fetish which
makes him a full-fledged member of the society. Even in the public
ceremony there may be mistreatment; at Santo Domingo the novice is
beaten. At Acoma the fire society throws its initiate on a bed of live
coals. The Sia snake society requires initiates to handle live
snakes.</P>

<P>During the summer the medicine societies exercise rain functions,
going into a "retreat", that is, retiring to their chambers for four
days during which they perform rituals to produce rain. These ceremonies
are highly esoteric and little known. Slat altars are usually employed
in addition to the sand or meal paintings. Fetishes are laid out, suds
of yucca root mixed in a cloud bowl, and sprinkled to the ritual
directions and over the altar and the medicine men. There are prayers
and songs for rain and sometimes prayer sticks are deposited. The
societies retreat at regular intervals, one at a time, often performing
several series during the season. Each retreat should be followed by a
one-day dance of the kachina. Where the kachina are masked, they are
usually led in by the medicine men.</P>

<P>At each solstice the medicine societies usually hold ceremonies which
are supposed to reverse the course of the sun. Usually the masks, if any
are owned by the society, are repainted and renovated at this time.
Offerings are deposited for the sun.</P>

<P><U>Phallic Clown Groups</U>: With one exception, Taos, the Rio Grande
Pueblos all have two clown groups which in many cases have some
association with the ceremonial moieties. They wear distinctive paint
and headdresses but no masks, and the group more markedly clownish in
behavior is usually associated with summer ceremonies, while the other
is associated with winter ceremonies, although either may appear, if
ordered to do so by the officials. Some of the groups indulge in
contrary behavior, that is, they speak the opposite of what they
actually mean. They are sometimes associated with war, participating in
the scalp or war society performances, and are also associated with the
rain and more particularly with the kachina dances.  Usually one of the
clown groups introduces the kachina dancers to the Pueblo. When the
kachina dances begin, the clowns cease their clowning and burlesques and
act as policemen, preventing people from coming too close to the
dancers, clearing the dance place of pebbles, and helping the dancers
should any of their costumes become disarranged.</P>

<P><U>Hunting Societies</U>: In some cases the hunting societies are
also curing societies, but this seems a late modification of their
functions. In some towns, particularly Tigua and Tewa, there appears to
be only a hunt chief who performs the functions elsewhere assigned to
the hunting society. These functions are the presiding at and performing
of necessary rituals in connection with communal hunts, and providing
individual hunters with the necessary charms, fetishes, and
offerings.</P>

<P>Jemez and Cochiti also have eagle societies, the members of which
hunt eagles to secure the necessary eagle feathers used extensively in
all rituals and in the decoration of prayer sticks of certain types.</P>

<P><U>War Societies</U>: Evidently all the Pueblos once had war or scalp
takers' societies, although at present they are virtually or entirely
extinct in many Pueblos. Sometimes those who have killed a bear or
mountain lion are also admitted to membership. Their functions are, or
were, extensive. They seem frequently to have performed regular scalp
ceremonials, regardless of whether a new scalp had been taken. These may
be regarded as a method of appeasing the spirits associated with the
scalps and also as rain ceremonies, for the scalps are believed to have
influence as rain makers. The scalps are usually kept in a covered jar
and are regularly "fed" corn meal or other ritual food. They also
sometimes had associations with ritual foot races and with storm
control, particularly the damaging spring wind storms.</P>

<P>Of other societies with sporadic occurrence, only the women's
societies may be mentioned here. These societies admit men to
membership, usually, just as men's societies sometimes admit women, so
that often the only real way of distinguishing the societies is to find
whether it is regarded by the natives as a man's or a woman's society.
Their ceremonies are usually associated with the production of abundant
crops. (White, 1928, 1932, 1932a; Parsons, 1920, 1920a, 1923c, 1923d,
1925a, 1929b, 1932; Goldfrank, 1923; M. C. Stevenson, 1884; Beals and
Parsons, MS, Pueblo and Mayo-Yaqui Clowns.)</P>

<P ALIGN="center">Ceremonies</P>

<P><U>Calendar</U>: The Pueblo calendar of ceremonies is a flexible
arrangement. Certain ceremonies are annually recurrent at regular
intervals and times. These are, in the main, the more important rituals
and ceremonies. Others recur at fairly regular but longer intervals,
some as much as five years apart. Finally, there are ceremonies and
rituals which are fixed by circumstances. Of this latter class are to be
considered the individual curing rites already described, certain types
of war and scalp ceremonies, and drought ceremonies.</P>

<P>The backbone of the calendar is the solstice, winter and summer,
among the Keres and also in the west. Among the Tewa, while the
solstices are observed, the seasonal transfer of ceremonies from the
winter ceremonial moiety to the summer, and vice versa, takes the place
of the solstices in importance. The sequence of ceremonies is arranged
by the time at which the chiefs of various organizations take their
turns in an esoteric retreat at which they perform their ceremonies or
else cooperate with a dance or other group to give a public dance or
other ritualistic performance.</P>

<P>The fairly regular series begins with the winter solstice (or winter
transfer), continues with snow making and wind control ceremonies,
pre-spring ground cleansing; ritual growth in prophecy of the coming
season, initiations, foot races or ball games for rain or fertility,
summer solstice (or summer transfer), summer rain retreats and
pilgrimages to springs, lakes, or mountain tops, harvest feasting and
dancing, autumn hunt ceremonies or war society initiation. In the Rio
Grande region the Catholic saint's calendar has been included with
Christmas, King's Day (January 6), Easter, All Soul's Day, and
observances for the patron saint of each town. On these occasions dances
of a non-esoteric nature may be observed. It is this part of the
calendar alone which may be viewed in the east by the general
public.</P>

<P>A good example is the Tewa calendar for the Pueblo of San Juan:</P>

<P>Early November, seasonal transfer, summer to winter.</P>

<P>December, about a month after the transfer, "winter cloud people
come", a kachina dance.</P>

<P>December, sporadic, Winter People (ceremonial moiety) holds adoption
ceremony.</P>

dancers, one Ute dancer with a choir of three.</P>

<P>New Year, little boys visit houses, given presents of bread.

dance; male dancers visit house of governor and two lieutenants for
presents of bread.</P>
