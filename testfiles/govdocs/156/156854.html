Tagatz, Marlin E. 1973. Larval Tarpon, Megalops atlanticus, from Pensacola, Florida. Copeia. 1(MARCH):140-141.  (ERL,GB 167). 
 </CITE><P>
A larval tarpon, Megalops atlanticus, an early Stage II as designated by Wade 
(1962), was collected in the upper reaches of East Bay, about 45 km from the 
Pensacola Inlet, Florida on 20 October 1970. It represents the second and most 
northern record of a larval tarpon from the Gulf of Mexico, and suggests late 
spawning in the Gulf.

 </CITE><P>
Effects of thermal fog [6 wt. oz/acre (420 g/ha)] and ULV aerosol spray [0.64 
fl. oz/acre (57 g/ha)] applications of malathion 95 (0,0-dimethyl 
phosphorodithioate of diethyl mercaptosuccinate) on salt-marsh environments 
near Pensacola Beach, Florida, were investigated. Studies were conducted on 
selected plots after each of three treatments using a portable thermal fogger 
and three ultra low volume (ULV) sprays with a truck-mounted generator. The ULV 
sprays were typical of usual mosquito-control operations. The foggings were on 
a small scale and results should be considered as indicative of what may occur 
under usual conditions. Deaths due to malathion were not observed among 
confined blue crabs, Callinectes sapidus; grass shrimps, Palaemonetes vulgaris 
and P. pugio; pink shrimp, Penaeus duorarum; or sheepshead minnows, Cyprinodon 
variegatus. Brain acetylcholinesterase activity was not reduced in confined C. 
variegatus exposed to one or more treatments. Confined animals and the snail, 
Littorina irrorata, contained no measurable malathion at our limits of 
detectability. The chemical was not detected in sediment, but concentrations as 
high as 4.10 parts per million (ppm) were found in Juncus sp., trace amounts 
persisting as long as 14 days (>0.05 but <0.10 ppm). Highest concentration in 
marsh water after fogging was 5.2 parts per billion (ppb); after ULV spraying, 
0.49 ppb. For each method of application, only trace amounts (>0.1 but <0.3 
ppb) persisted in marsh water as long as 1 day.

 </CITE><P>
Macrobentanimal communities developed in laboratory and in field aquaria during 
8 weeks were exposed to various concentrations of the pyrethroid insecticide, 
fenvalerate. Laboratory communities, developed from planktonic larvae in 
unfiltered seawater, were continuously exposed to the toxicant during 
colonization. Field communities, developed in aquaria placed in Santa Rosa 
Sound, FL, were exposed in the laboratory to fenvalerate after colonization, 
for 1 week. Abundance of amphipods in both laboratory and field communities was 
significantly affected (a=0.05) by 0.01 µg fenvalerate/l water (nominal 
concentration). The lancelate, Branchiostoma caribaeum, also was very sensitive 
to 0.1 µg/l in field communities; it did not occur in laboratory communities. 
Numbers of mollusks and annelids in contaminated aquaria were not significantly 
reduced from control numbers by the highest concentrations of fenvalerate 
tested, 1.1 µg/l (measured) in field communities. Of an overall total of 79 
species of animals, only 15 appeared in both laboratory and field studies.

 </CITE><P>
Four 28-day seasonal experiments were conducted using selected estuarine 
animals in outdoor tanks that received continuous flow of mirex-laden water. 
Mirex (dodecachlorooctahydro-1,3,4-metheno-2H-cyclobuta [cd] pentalene) leached 
from fire ant bait (0.3% mirex) by fresh water and then mixed with salt water 
was toxic to blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus), pink shrimp (Penaeus duorarum), 
and grass shrimp (Palaemonetes pugio) but not to sheepshead minnows (Cyprinodon 
variegatus), at concentrations less than 0.53 µg/l in water. The amount of 
leaching was greatest in summer and least in spring. Greatest mortality 
occurred in summer at the highest water temperature and concentration of mirex; 
least mortality occurred in spring at next to the lowest temperature and at the 
lowest concentration. Earliest deaths of blue crabs occurred after six days of 
exposure and shrimps after two days. Small juvenile crabs were more sensitive 
to leached mirex than were large juveniles. Mirex did not appear to affect 
growth or frequency of molting in crabs. All exposed animals concentrated 
mirex. Among animals that survived for 28 days, sheepshead minnows concentrated 
mirex 40,800X above the concentration in the water, blue crabs 2,300X, pink 
shrimp 10,000X, and grass shrimp 10,800X. Sand substrata contained mirex up to 
770X that in the water. Most control and exposed animals in samples examined 
histologically had normal tissues, but alteration in gills of some exposed fish 
and natural pathogens in some exposed and control crabs and shrimp were 
observed. The experiments demonstrated that mirex can be leached from bait by 
fresh water, concentrated by estuarine organisms, and can be toxic to crabs and 
shrimps.

 </CITE><P>
Experimental communities of various estuarine animals in outdoor tanks were 
exposed to a continuous flow of water containing mirex for 10 weeks. The mirex 
was leached from from fire ant bait (0.3% active ingredient) by fresh water 
which was then mixed with salt water to yield exposure concentrations averaging 
0.038 µg/L. The experiment simulated runoff from treated land into estuarine 
areas. Mortality of grass shrimp (Palaemonetes vulgaris), pink shrimp (Penaeus 
duorarum), common mud crabs (Panopeus herbstii), and striped hermit crabs 
(Clibanarius vittatus) was significantly higher in tanks containing the 
toxicant. Mortality of ribbed mussels (Modiolus demissus) and American oysters 
(Crassostrea virginica) was significantly lower in treated tanks, probably 
because numbers of both species of crabs, which ate the bivalves, were reduced. 
Sheepshead minnows (Cyprinodon variegatus) were least affected by mirex. Almost 
all deaths occurred after 10 or more days of exposure. All exposed animals 
accumulated mirex, with maximum concentrations ranging from 5,000X (pink 
shrimp) to 73,700X (soft tissues of oysters) above the concentration in the 
water. Sand substratum contained mirex up to 1,500X that in the water. The 
study demonstrated that mirex can be leached from bait by fresh water and 
concentrated by and affect survival of members in an experimental estuarine 
community.

 </CITE><P>
Tests of 14- to 16-days duration were conducted to determine the distribution 
and sublethal effects of mirex in an experimental estuarine ecosystem. The 
insecticide was translocated from water at concentrations of 0.011 to 0.13 
µg/liter to sand, plant, and animal components. An alteration of predator-prey 
interaction due to mirex was manifested by a significant difference (X2 test, a
= 0.05) in survival of grass shrimp, Palaemonetes vulgaris, in control and 
treated tanks after one, two, or three days of predation by pinfish, Lagodon 
rhomboides.

Pentachlorophenol affected the composition of communities of estuarine 
organisms developed in sand from planktonic larvae in estuarine water that 
flowed through ten control aquaria and ten aquaria per exposure concentration 
averaging 7, 76, or 622 µg/liter. Annelids, arthropods, and mollusks were the 
numerically dominant phyla when animals were collected in a 1-mm-mesh sieve 
after 9 wk of exposure. Mollusks were markedly fewer at 7 µg/liter; annelids 
and arthropods at 76 µg/liter. Almost no animals occurred at 622 µg/liter. The 
total numbers of individuals and species were significantly less (a=0.01) In 
aquaria exposed to 76 µg/liter. than in those unexposed or exposed to 7 
µg/liter.

 </CITE><P>
Barite (BaSO4), the primary component of oil drilling muds, affected the 
composition of estuarine communities developed from planktonic larvae in 
aquaria containing sand and flowing estuarine water. Aquaria contained: sand 
only; a mixture (by volume) of 1 part barite and 10 parts sand; 1 part barite, 
and 3 parts sand; or sand covered by 0.5 cm barite. For all environments, 
annelids and mollusks were the numerically dominant phyla collected in a 
1-mm-mesh sieve after 10 weeks exposure; a total of 3020 animals, representing 
59 species, was collected. Significantly fewer animals and species (a=0.01) 
developed in aquaria sand covered by barite than in aquaria unexposed or 
exposed to 1 barite:10 sand. Number of animals in aquaria containing 1 barite:3 
sand also differed (a=0.05) from that in control aquaria. Annelids were 
particularly affected and significantly fewer        (a=0.01) were found in all 
treatments than in the control. Mollusks decreased markedly in number only in 
barite-covered aquaria. Barite, however, did not impede growth (as height) of 
the abundant clam, Laevicardium mortoni, or decrease abundance of six other 
phyla. Our data indicate that large quantities of this compound, as discharged 
in offshore oil drilling, possibly could adversely affect the colonization of 
benthic animals.

(Avail. from NTIS, Springfield, VA: PB-290 037)
 </CITE><P>
Aquaria containing clean sand received a continuous supply of flowing seawater 
from Santa Rosa Sound, Florida, mixed with known quantities of Dowicide® G-ST 
(79% sodium pentachlorophenate) for thirteen weeks. The measured concentrations 
of pentachlorophenol (PCP) in aquaria were 1.8, 15.8 and 161 µg/l. At the end 
of the experiment, macrofauna established in control and experimental aquaria 
was examined. Mollusks, arthropods and annelids were numerically dominant among 
the macrofauna. Although exposure to 1.8 µg PCP/l had no effect, the higher 
concentrations of PCP caused marked reduction in the numbers of individuals and 
species. Mollusks were the most sensitive taxonomic group to PCP. These results 
and our previous studies on the effects of a nine-week exposure to PCP in the 
establishment of macrobenthic communities indicate that discharge of PCP into 
natural waters could alter the normal colonization by benthic animals and could 
impact various ecological relationships among localized populations.

 </CITE><P>
Drilling mud, as used in exploratory drilling for oil offshore, affected the 
composition of estuarine communities that developed from planktonic larvae in 
aquaria containing sand and flowing estuarine water. Aquaria contained: sand 
only; a mixture (by volume) of 1 part mud and 10 parts sand; 1 part mud and 5 
parts sand; or sand covered by 0.2 cm mud. For all environments, annelids, 
mollusks, arthropods, and coelenterates were the numerically dominant phyla 
collected in a 1 mm mesh sieve after eight weeks exposure; a total of 1,025 
animals, representing 45 species, was collected. Annelids and coelenterates 
were significantly fewer (a=0.05) in aquaria containing drilling mud than in 
the control aquaria. Arthropods were significantly affected only by mud cover 
over sand; mollusks also were diminished in this environment, but not 
significantly. Exposure to concentrations of drilling mud reduced not only the 
number of individuals, but also the frequency of occurence of macrobenthic 
species. Thus, the average number of annelid species in 1 part mud: 5 parts 
sand aquaria or in mud-covered aquaria was significantly less than in control 
aquaria. The average number of arthropod species per aquarium was also 
significantly less in mud-cover exposure than in the control. Discharge of 
large quantities of drilling mud at levels tested in the laboratory could 
adversely affect the colonization of various substrata by benthic animals in 
nature.

 </CITE><P>
The composition of animal communities developing from planktonic larvae in 
aquariums containing sand and flowing estuarine water was altered in the 
presence of the carbamate insecticide Sevin (carbaryl). Treatments were control 
and concentrations of Sevin that averaged 1.1, 11.1, and 103 µg/l; each 
treatment was replicated 8 times. Animals that colonized aquarium sand were 
collected in a 1-mm mesh sieve after 10 wk of exposure. Mollusks, arthropods, 
annelids, and nemerteans were the numerically dominant phyla. The average 
number of species per aquarium was significantly less (a=0.05) in aquariums 
containing 11.1 or 103 µg/l than in those containing 1.1 µg/l or in control 
aquariums. The abundant clam Ensis minor grew significantly less in length at 
the higher concentrations of Sevin. The amphipod Corophium acherusicum was 
particularly affected; significantly fewer were found at all concentrations 
than in the control aquariums. A marked increase in the abundance of the 
annelid Polydora ligni in aquariums containing 103 µg/l corresponded to a 
marked decrease in the number of other annelids and to a significant absence of 
nemerteans.

 </CITE><P>
The effects of various biocides, as used in drilling muds for exploratory 
drilling for oil offshore, were determined by comparing macrobenthic 
communities that developed from planktonic larvae in treated and untreated 
aquaria. Surflo®-B33 and Aldacide® were tested simultaneously. Harvest at seven 
weeks yielded 1,941 animals, representing 37 species of 6 phyla. The effects of 
Surflo®-B33 (25 percent dichlorophenol and other chlorophenals) on these 
communities were similar to those of pentachlorophenol, a biocide known to be 
toxic to many aquatic organisms. Significantly fewer (a=0.05) chordates, 
mollusks, and annelids occurred in 819 µg Surflo®-B33/l (measured) than in the 
control; mollusks were most sensitive and also significantly fewer in aquaria 
receiving 41 µg/l. Average numbers of animals and species per aquarium did not 
significantly decrease in Aldacide® (91% paraformaldehyde) at nominal 
concentrations of 15 and 300 µg/l. The high toxicity of the chlorophenols 
tested indicates that the use of alternative biocides, possibly 
paraformaldehyde, should be considered for natural waters.

 </CITE><P>
The effects of drilling mud on development of estuarine macrobenthic 
communities, which result from settling planktonic larvae, were assessed by 
comparing number and species of animals that grew in uncontaminated and 
contaminated aquaria for at least 7 weeks. Aquaria contained sand and were 
continuously supplied with unfiltered seawater. We tested whole drilling mud, 
barite (mud-weighting agent), a paraformaldehyde-type biocide (Aldacide®), and 
three chlorophenol-type biocides (pentachlorophenol, Dowicide® G-ST, and Surflo 
B-33). Tests with whole drilling mud and barite were designed to determine 
their impact as a cover (2 or 5 mm) over the substratum and when mixed with 
clean sand (ratios of 1:10 sand and higher). Annelids were most sensitive to 
drilling mud and barite and significantly fewer (a=0.05) in all contaminated 
aquaria than in control aquaria. For all phyla, the average number of species 
per aquarium was significantly less in treatments with a cover of mud or barite 
than in the controls. Mollusks were particularly affected by the 
chlorophenol-type biocides and significantly fewer  (a-0.05) at concentrations 
(active ingredient in water) of 7 µg pentachlorophenol/l, 18 µg Dowicide G/l, 
and 10 µg Surflo B-33/l. Numbers of individuals and species of annelids per 
experimental aquarium were also significantly less than in control aquaria at 
76 µg pentacholorphenol/l, 183 µg Dowicide G/l, and 205 µg Surflo B-33/l. 
Numbers of animals and species did not significantly decrease in the presence 
of Aldacide at nominal concentrations (active ingredient) as high as 273 µg/l. 
Adverse effects of drilling mud on marine benthos could result from toxic 
constituents or from those that physically alter the substrate.

The effects of drilling mud, used in oil drilling operations, on development of 
estuarine macrobenthic communities from settling planktonic larvae were 
assessed by comparing numbers and species of animals that grew in 
uncontaminated and contaminated aquaria for 8 weeks. Aquaria contained sand and 
were continuously supplied with unfiltered seawater. Seven lignosulfonate-type 
drilling muds obtained from an active exploratory platform in estuarine waters 
were tested consecutively at nominal concentrations of 0.5, 5, and 50 parts per 
million (ppm) in the water column. Numbers of tunicates, mollusks, and annelids 
per aquarium were significantly (a=0.05) decreased from control numbers in 50 
ppm. Structural differences in communities exposed to 50 ppm from those in the 
control and lower concentrations were indicated by a decrease in Spearman's 
measure of rank correlation of species abundance and an increase in the 
Shannon-Weaver index of species diversity. A total of 13 species occurred in 50 
ppm compared to 23 species in each of the other situations. Growth in diameter 
of Molgula manhattensis was significantly affected in all concentrations of 
mud.

A study of the response of benthic communities exposed to pentachlorophenol (PCP) was conducted to obtain additional information on the effects of this widely used chemical on the estuarine environment and to compare its effect on estuarine benthic communities developed in the field and in the laboratory. PCP is used as a wood preservative, and insecticide, a fungicide and a bactericide, and is toxic to many aquatic organisms. In earlier laboratory experiments, developing benthic communities, from planktonic larvae settling in sand-filled aquaria, were continuously exposed to PCP. In the present study, already established communities were exposed to PCP.

Macrobenthic animal communities, developed in sand-filled aquaria in the 
laboratory and in the field, were exposed to various concentrations of the 
insecticide, chlorpyrifos, and effects on community structure assessed. 
Laboratory communities were continuously exposed to the toxicant for eight 
weeks during colonization by planktonic larvae in unfiltered Santa Rosa Sound, 
Florida, seawater. Field communities developed for eight weeks in aquaria 
placed in Santa Rosa Sound and then removed to the laboratory for exposure to 
chlorpyrifos for one week. Abundance of arthropods was significantly diminished 
(a=0.05) by measured concentrations of chlorpyrifos which is greater than or 
equal to 0.1 µg/l in water in laboratory communities and by 5.9 µg/l in water 
in field communities. Numbers of annelids and chordates in contaminated aquaria 
were not reduced by the highest concentrations of chlorpyrifos tested, 8.5 µg/l 
in laboratory-colonized aquaria and 5.9 µg/l in field-colonized aquaria. One 
species of annelid, Cistenides gouldii, was more abundant in field aquaria 
receiving 1.0 µg/l or 5.9 µg/l than in the control and lowest concentration. 
Molluscan larvae colonizing laboratory aquaria were sensitive to >or = 0.1 µg/l
; however, later developmental stages characterizing field aquaria were not 
sensitive to less than or equal to 5.9 µg/l. Although only 20 of 78 animals 
species appeared in both laboratory and field communities, sensitivity of 
animals in these tests and in single species tests could be compared.

The structures of macrobenthic communities that colonized sand-filled boxes were compared to learn if laboratory-developed assemblages of animals used in toxicity studies realistically simulate those in nature. Laboratory boxes were colonized for eight weeks in Spring and Fall by planktonic larvae from continuously-supplied unfiltered seawater; field boxes, by naturally-occurring estuarine animals. Laboratory communities had larger numbers, but fewer species than field communities. One-fourth of the species found in field boxes also occurred in laboratory boxes. Species density, diversity, and dominance were similar in both environments in Fall, but differed in Spring. The degree of similarity of laboratory assemblages of benthic animals to the highly variable assemblages in the field indicates applicability of laboratory toxicity studies to nature.

Recovery of macrobenthic animal communities in sand-filled aquaria was 
determined 7 weeks after a 5-week exposure to 55 µg/l pentachlorophenol. The 
communities developed from planktonic larvae in flowing estuarine water 
continuously supplied during treatment and recovery. Significantly fewer (a
=0.05) individuals and species occurred in contaminated aquaria than in control 
aquaria immediately after exposure to pentachlorophenol. Numbers of arthropods, 
chordates, echinoderms, and mollusks were decreased; annelids and coelenterates 
were not affected. Seven weeks after exposure was discontinued, total numbers 
of individuals and species in previously contaminated and control aquaria no 
longer differed. The dominant echinoderm, Leptosynapta inhaerens, reduced 
numerically in contaminated aquaria at 5 weeks, increased in number not 
significantly different from the control at 12 weeks. However, there were some 
differences among species in previously contaminated aquaria and the control 
that could be attributed to the toxicant. Numbers of Galathowenia sp., the 
dominant annelid at 12 weeks and not collected at 5 weeks, were lower in 
previously contaminated aquaria than in control aquaria. The dominant mollusk, 
Laevicardium mortoni, did not recover after it was reduced in abundance by 
exposure to PCP. Major differences in community structure between 5 and 12 
weeks were not toxicant related, however, and possibly represent natural 
succession. These consisted of reduced numbers of amphipods, Corophium 
acherusicum, and tunicates, Molgula manhattensis, at 12 weeks in both control 
and previously contaminated aquaria.

Macrobenthic animal communities developed in sand-filled aquaria in the 
laboratory and in the field were exposed to three concentrations of the 
plasticizer, di-n-butyl phathalate (DBP), and effects on community structure 
were assessed. Laboratory communities were colonized by planktonic larvae in 
unfiltered sea water; field communities, by naturally occurring animals. After 
8 wk of colonization, laboratory and field communities (removed to the 
laboratory) were exposed to DBP for 2 wk. The numbers of individuals and 
species of animals in aquaria receiving 3.7 mg DBP/1 (laboratory-colonized) or 
3.8 mg DBP/l (field-colonized) were significantly less than those in control 
aquaria or in aquaria that received lower concentrations of the plasticizer. 
Affected phyla in laboratory or field faunal assemblages were chordates, 
mollusks, arthropods, and annelids. Amphipods, Corophium acherusicum, collected 
only from laboratory communities, also were significantly fewer in communities 
exposed to 0.34 mg DBP/l. Density of individuals and numbers of species were 
not affected by 0.04 mg DBP/l.

Macrobenthic animal communities that colonized uncontaminated and 
creosote-contaminated sand (177, 844 and 4,420 µg/g, nominal) during 8 weeks 
were compared to assess effects of marine-grade creosote on community 
structure. Aquaria were colonized in the laboratory by planktonic larvae 
entrained in continuously supplied unfiltered seawater and in the field by 
animals that occurred naturally. Individuals and species in aquaria that 
contained 844 and 4,420 µg creosote/g were significantly fewer (a=0.05) than 
those in the control. Abundance of animals in field-colonized communities 
contaminated with 177 µg/g, but not in laboratory-colonized communities, also 
was less than that in the control. The lowest creosote concentration at either 
site that affected numbers of individuals or species was 844 µg/g for mollusks 
and 177 µg/g for echinoderms, annelids and arthropods. The Shannon-Weaver index 
of diversity, Simpson's index of dominance, and the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity 
index differences were greater with each increase in creosote concentration. 
Rarefaction indices of diversity indicated that the distribution of individuals 
within species was about the same for laboratory and field assemblages of 
animals. Initial measured concentrations of creosote in sand (midrange 
concentration) decreased by 30% in the laboratory and by 42% in the field at 
the end of the 8-week test.

Boxes filled with clean sand or clean sand with a 2-cm overlay of mixtures of sand with barite or drilling mud were placed in Santa Rosa Sound, Florida, to determine the effects of a used lime drilling-mud on field-colonized macrobenthic communities. Effect of the drilling mud on community structure was greater than that of its barite component after colonization for 8 weeks. Barite causes changes in texture of the sediment and thereby recruitment. The average numbers of animals and species in boxes containing 1:10 and 1:3 mixtures of mud to sand were significantly less than those in control boxes and most of the barite/sand mixtures. The Shannon-Weaver index of diversity, Simpson's index of dominance, and the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index differed only for 1:3 mud/sand communities. Toxic effects of the lime drilling mud were attributed to a diesel fuel oil component (3.98 mg/g of mud).

 </CITE><P>
The effects of fenthion on macrobenthic animals that colonized sand-filled 
boxes at two salt marsh sites were determined after two field sprayings within 
5 days and in the laboratory after intermittent exposures that simulated field 
conditions. ULV ground applications for adult mosquito control resulted in 
water concentrations <=0.68 µg fenthion/l at one site and <=0.38 µg/l at the 
other site. There were no statistically significant differences (a= 0.05) in 
average numbers of benthic individuals and species (primarily annelids and 
arthropods) that colonized control communities and those exposed to these 
concentrations. 

The average numbers of individuals and species of animals that colonized 
sand-filled boxes in the laboratory (during 9 wk by planktonic larvae from 
continuously supplied unfiltered seawater) were not significantly affected by 
two treatments at 1.1 µg fenthion/l or by four treatments at 1.3 µg/l. However, 
the average number of species in communities exposed to two treatments at 11.8 
µg/l was significantly less than that in control communities and those exposed 
to lower concentrations. Mean abundances of mollusks, arthropods, and chordates 
were substantially (19 or more percent), but not statistically significantly, 
lower in this concentration than in the control.

Effects of toxicants on estuarine macrobenthic animals that developed in sand-filled boxes in the laboratory and field during eight weeks were determined by comparing community structures in control boxes and in boxes treated with a toxicant. Boxes were colonized in the laboratory by planktonic larvae in continuously supplied unfiltered seawater and in the field by animals that occurred naturally. Field boxes were placed in estuarine waters, either near the laboratory or at salt-marsh sites subjected to contamination by mosquito control pesticide applications. Eight separate studies were conducted using the same test materials in laboratory and field tests. Communities that developed were diverse and averaged 1441 individuals, 30 species, and 6 phyla for laboratory tests and 933 individuals, 51 species, and 8 phyla for field tests. Toxicants were introduced via water, air, or sediment and before, during, or after colonization. Tests with laboratory- and field-colonized communities provided corroborating data as well as date unique to each test. Various structural attributes among laboratory, experimental field, and natural field communities were similar, indicating that data derived from the laboratory and field toxicity tests can have good environmental applicability.

 </CITE><P>
Macrobenthic animal communities that colonized sand-filled aquaria were exposed 
to 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB), a recent replacement for polychlorinated 
biphenyls in the electrical industry. In one test, communities established by 
planktonic larvae entrained in continuously supplied unfiltered seawater for 50 
days were exposed to waterborne TCB for 6 days; in the second test, the 
toxicant was added to the sediment before 8 weeks of colonization. 
Concentrations that affected community structure were usually two orders of 
magnitude lower for waterborne TCB than for sediment-bound TCB, but the same 
types of organisms were affected by each route of exposure. The lowest TCB 
concentrations (measured) that affected average numbers of individuals exposed 
via the water were 0.04 mg/liter for mollusks, 0.4 mg/liter for arthropods, and 
4 mg/liter for annelids. Average number of species was significantly lower than 
the control at 4 mg/liter. For TCB exposures via the sediment, the lowest 
concentrations (nominal) that affected average numbers of individuals were 100 
µg/g for mollusks and echinoderms, and 1000 µg/g for arthropods and annelids. 
Average number of species in experimental aquaria was significantly lower than 
the control at >= 100 µg/g. TCB persisted in sediments, but some leached into 
water throughout the 8-week exposure via sediment.

Dibutyl phthalate (DBP), one of a large class of alkyl esters of 1,2-benzene dicarboxylic acid, is used widely in the United States and other countries as a plasticizer for epoxy and PVC resin. Significant amounts of DBP commonly occur in the aquatic environment, including the sediment. Its octanol-water partition coefficient of #5.2 (US EPA 1979) indicates that sorption of DBP by sediment could be substantial in waters polluted by this chemical. Concentrations as high as 89 ppb have been reported in sediment samples from Chesapeake Bay and up to 15.5 ppm in those from the Rhine River. To obtain information on the effects of DBP on estuarine communities exposed via the sediment, we investigated the responses of macrobenthic animals that colonized sand contaminated with this chemical in the laboratory and field.

Macrobenthic animal communities that colonized uncontaminated and 
fenvalerate-contaminated sand (0.1, 1 and 10 µg/g dry weight, nominal) in boxes 
placed for 8 weeks in an estuary were compared to assess effects of fenvalerate 
on community structure. As much as 27% of initial concentrations of this 
synthetic pyrethrin persisted in sediment at the end of the test. The average 
number of species (35.6) in communities in five replicates exposed to 10 µg/g 
was significantly less than that in the control (47.8) and lower concentrations 
(45.0 and 46.2). Of the dominant phyla collected (Annelida, Mollusca, Chordata, 
and Arthropoda), abundance of chordates only (primarily lancelets, 
Branchiostoma caribaeum) was reduced by 10 µg fenvalerate/g. Biological indices 
applied to the data showed the greatest structural differences for communities 
exposed to the highest concentration, but these did not differ substantially 
from those for the control. Effective concentration for exposure via the 
sediment was five orders of magnitude greater than that for waterborne exposure 
determined in earlier benthic community studies.

Concentrations of mirex among individual tanks in each test were not 
statistically different at the 5-percent significance level; whereas, 
differences in mirex concentrations in tank water among experiments were 
significant. Paired comparisons indicated statistical differences between the 
first and second, and the second and third experiments, but not between the 
first and third experiment. These differences in mean mirex concentrations in 
tank water may have been caused by seasonal variations in water temparature. 
Fluctuations in the mirex concentrations within individual tanks were not 
significant. 

In its present state of development, the described gravity-flow column is being 
utilized in seasonal tests to deliver mirex-laden water to determine toxicity 
and uptake of mirex by several animal species in an artificial estuarine 
ecosystem.

The effect of substances on development of estuarine communities was assessed 
by comparing the numbers, species, and phyla of benthic animals that grew from 
planktonic larvae in an uncontaminated apparatus and three identical 
apparatuses continuously contaminated (each with a different concentration) for 
two to four months. Each apparatus was separated into 10 sand-filled 
compartments (40 total) and received a continuous flow of seawater containing 
natural plankton. We conducted six experiments, using Aroclor 1254, toxaphene, 
pentachlorophenol, Dowicide G-ST, barite, and a lignosulfonate drilling mud. 

The communities that developed during each test were diverse, averaging more 
than 4000 individuals, 50 species, and seven phyla. Comparison of the results 
of these tests with results of acute and chronic exposures of single species 
demonstrates that: (a) the test can be as sensitive or more sensitive than 
chronic exposures of single species because the often more sensitive early 
developmental stages are exposed; and (b) species typically impacted are 
representatives of phyla also sensitive in single species tests. Also, the test 
may identify sensitive species not normally tested, thereby helping us to 
select species for additional toxicity tests. The test can also assess impacts 
of substances that affect community structure by physically altering the 
substrate.
