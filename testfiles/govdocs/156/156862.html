                          <p>Three years ago, Harvard professor Edward O. Wilson gave an NIH
                            Director's Lecture demonstrating that science is far from knowing
                            how many kinds of microscopic critters are on the premises when
                            a simple log decomposes in the woods. Stanford's Dr. David Relman
                            took that argument an intimate step further Oct. 27 at NIAID's
                            annual Kinyoun Lecture; we don't even know how many kinds of microbes
                            colonize our mouths, guts, skin and other mucosa.</p>

                              is what we are. Humans have 10<sup>13</sup> cells, but host 10<SUP CLASS=exponent>14</SUP> microbes. "In
                              other words, we are 10 parts microbe, and one part human," Relman
                              noted. "We are clearly outnumbered." </font></p>

                          <p>The notion that we are not alone began some 350 years ago, when
                            Leeuwenhoek trained his microscope on such samples as human hair
                            and teeth. He found in dental plaque a variety of tiny motile creatures,
                            noting that the little "animalcules" withered and died on contact
                            with hot coffee. </p>
                          <p>Subsequent centuries of scientific inquiry discovered the world
                            of bacteria, entrée to which was possible chiefly by cell culturing
                            techniques &#8212; literally getting the bugs to multiply on a
                            bed of food. That approach has limits though. What if the microbes
                            in a given environment don't like what you've given them to eat?
                            The problem with taking roll by cell culture is that you may be
                            serving steak to an audience of vegans, and would therefore not
                            know how many were at the table simply by counting cleaned plates. </p>
                          <p>Today, the tools for discovering what kind of microbial baggage
                            we carry are far more sophisticated and sensitive &#8212; measuring
                            ribosomal DNA (rDNA), for example &#8212; and the roles our fellow
                            travelers play are only starting to be understood. </p>
                          Relman and his colleagues want to know the purpose of our internal
                          gardens, and their role in health and disease.
                          <p>The conventional wisdom is that we begin life "sterile" (that
                            is, culture-negative, although there could be flora we don't yet
                            know about) until the rupture of the amniotic membranes. There
                            follows a long roster of benefits conferred by microbes throughout
                            human development, including vitamin production, food degradation
                            and colonization resistance. Microbial flora promote the terminal
                            differentiation of mucosa, the innate immune defenses and epithelial
                            homeostasis in the gut. </p>
                          <p>Recently, in what Relman termed "a truly surprising and revolutionary" role
                            for microbes, they appear to regulate fat storage. A recent article
                            in the<em> Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em> showed
                            that "germ-free animals have significantly lower body fat than
                            those raised in a microbial-infected environment," Relman said. "That's
                            a result not previously suspected." </p>

                          <p>Because technology now permits a far broader view of microbes
                            than did cell culture, scientists can investigate the microbial
                            universe in more detail. Although there remain limits to detectability,
                            there seem to be about 80 phyla in nature, based on current estimates.
                            Focusing on bacteria that colonize the mouth, investigators have
                            discovered a wide diversity of microbes that belong primarily to
                            four phyla &#8212; the firmicutes, bacteroidetes, fusobacteria
                            and proteobacteria. Yet if you could follow a bite of dinner past
                            the mouth into the esophagus, stomach, small intestines, colon
                            and beyond, you would encounter distinct microbial neighborhoods
                            with very different characteristics. "The biota of the stomach
                            is distinct from the colon, or esophagus, or mouth," Relman said. </p>
                          <p>In the large intestine, for example, at least seven phyla are
                            represented. In one study, a look at three individuals found close
                            to 500 bacterial phylotypes in the colon and feces, 62 percent
                            of which were novel and 80 percent of which could not be cultivated.
                            When these scientists estimated the completeness of this survey,
                            they were humbled to find that their analysis of nearly 12,000
                            bacterial sequences had revealed no more than two-thirds of the
                            strains and species that were predicted to be present. </p>
                          <p>"Individuals vary quite distinctly in the make-up of their flora," Relman
                            said. "To answer the question, 'Who's there?' would require a very
                            large study population." </p>
                          <p>Beyond the fascination of what's aboard the human raft, Relman
                            and associates want to know the sources of variability in human
                            microbial colonization, and what factors perturb them. Clearly,
                            host genetics, diet and age play roles, but "there are not enough
                            data to know what's truly important, and to what degree." </p>
                          <p>As if it isn't hard enough to tease out the role of dominant microbial
                            species, the part "rare members" may play is even more of a mystery.
                            Relman suggested there may be "keystone" or "founder" species without
                            which the entire microbial ecosystem collapses. </p>
                          <p>A range of diseases known to have microbial elements is under
                            review in Relman's laboratory, including Crohn's disease, irritable
                            bowel syndrome, periodontitis, diarrhea, and even premature labor
                            and delivery. All are tied to disturbances in microbial ecology.
                            Thus far, periodontitis, a disease affecting about 40 percent of
                            the adult population in the U.S., is linked in a subset of patients
                            to an abundance of archaeal sequences during stages of severe disease. </p>
                          <p>To gain a better perspective on this largely hidden frontier,
                            Relman suggested harnessing microarray technology to do more high-throughput
                            analyses of microbial community structure, continue with rDNA screening,
                            establish correlations with host genotypes and develop more sophisticated
                            cultivation technologies. </p>
                          <p>He called for a "second Human Genome Project" that would survey
                            the genomes of the organisms that populate our bodies. "We need
                            to ask, 'Who's there?', 'What are their genes?', 'What are their
                            functional capabilities? 'How do their patterns of gene expression
                            and associated activities define health?'" </p>
                          <p>One of his collaborations, with the Institute for Genomic Research
                            in Rockville, involves the "metagenomics" of both the human fecal
                            and oral microbiomes. He concluded, "The diversity and variation
                            of the human indigenous microbial flora is still poorly understood." </p>
