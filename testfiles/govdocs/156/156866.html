<h1>ABSTRACT</h1>
<p>This report, a product of the National Water-Quality Assessment Program, is a compilation of physical data and
biological data for algae, aquatic invertebrates, and fish collected in the Carson and Truckee River Basins, Nevada and
California. Most of the data were collected between 1993 and 1996 at selected reaches on the Carson and Truckee Rivers.
Algae and aquatic invertebrate samples were collected from cobble riffles, submerged woody-snag habitats, and from
depositional areas such as pools. Between 1993 and 1996, fish and crayfish were collected from all wadeable habitats at
each of seven basic-fixed sites using either electroshocking methods or seining. Additional fish and crayfish were
collected at one site on the Truckee River in 1997. Fish were identified to species, measured for total and standard
length, checked for anomalies, and weighed at the collection site. Fish were returned to the stream after measurements
were taken. Measurements of water depth, stream velocity, determinations of substrate type and substrate embeddedness
were made at each sampling site. Algae and aquatic invertebrate samples were sent to the U.S. Geological Survey National
Water-Quality Laboratory for identification and enumeration.</p>
<p>A total of 103 semi-quantitative and 55 qualitative algae samples were collected at 20 river reaches on the Carson
and Truckee Rivers between 1993 and 1996. These samples represent algae in cobble riffles, on submerged woody snags, and
on sediment surfaces in depositional areas. In those 158 samples, 514 algal species, varieties, or forms were
identified. Of the 8 algal phyla represented, the diatoms (Phylum Bacillariophyta) were the most abundant with 351
species, varieties, or forms. The green algae (Phylum Chlorophyta) were next in abundance with 108 species, varieties,
or forms followed by the blue-green algae (Phylum Cyanophyta) with 41 species, varieties, or forms.</p>
<p>A total of 49 semi-quantitative aquatic invertebrate samples were collected at 27 river reaches on the Carson and
Truckee Rivers between 1993 and 1996. These samples represent invertebrates in cobble riffles and on submerged woody
snags. In those 49 samples, members of 6 phyla were identified. Roundworms were identified only to phylum (Nematoda) and
free-living flatworms and snails were identified only to class (Turbellaria and Gastroda). Organisms were identified as
belonging to 19 invertebrate orders. Most of the invertebrates that could be identified to genus or species belonged in
the orders Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera of the arthropod class Insecta.</p>
<p>Fish and crayfish populations in the Carson and Truckee Rivers were sampled 29 times between 1993 and 1997. These
collections resulted in the identification of 18 fish species and one endemic crayfish species. Twelve of the 18 fish
species identified are not native to the Carson and Truckee River Basins.</p>
