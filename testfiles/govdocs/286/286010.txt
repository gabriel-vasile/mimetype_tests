          4. Geostationary Meteorological Satellite-5 (GMS-5)

4.1 Outlines

 The Geostationary Meteorological Satellite-5 (GMS-5) will provide 
meteorological satellite services, forming part of a network of 
meteorological satellite of Global Observing System (GOS) for the 
World Weather Watch (WWW) program planned by the World Meteorological 
Organization (WMO). As a member of WMO, Japan responded to the needs 
of WWW program by developing a geostationary meteorological satellite 
(GMS). In July,1977, GMS, known as "Himawari (a sunflower)", was
launched into geostationary orbit, approximately 36,000 km above the 
equator at 140 deg E longitude. Subsequently, GMS-2 was launched in 
August 1981, GMS-3 in August 1984 and GMS-4 in September 1989 to 
continue this meteorological satellite service.
 GMS-5, the successor of GMS/GMS-2/GMS-3/GMS-4, is to continue this 
meteorological satellite service and contribute not only to 
improvement of meteorological satellite service, but also to 
development of related technology. GMS-5 will be launched by the 
third  H-II test vehicle from the Tanegashima Space Center on February 
1, 1995.

4.2 Objectives

 GMS-5 has the following mission objectives.

(1) Observation by the Visible and Infrared Spin Scan Radiometer(VISSR)
 GMS-5 will observe the earth cloud cover location, the earth 
temperature such as ground, sea surface and cloud top temperature and 
atmospheric  water vapor distribution from geostationary orbit both 
in the visible and infrared spectra (earth image acquisition). 
Earth images are taken every 30 minutes by VISSR with 1.25 km visible
and 5 km infrared resolution. These images are transmitted an processed
on the ground to get the following data on:

  .severe weather such as typhoons and torrential rains.
  .cloud distribution and wind speeds.
  .sea-surface temperature.
  .atmospheric water vapor distribution.

(2) Weather Data Ralay

 Weather data sent by the Data Collection Platforms (DCP), which are 
installed mainly on ships, buoys and aircrafts, are relayed by the 
GMS-5 communication subsystem and received at the Command and Data 
Acquisition Station (CDAS) to be processed at the Data Processing 
Center (DPC). 

(3) Observation Data Relay

 Earth image data transmitted by the satellite are to be processed 
by the Stretched VISSR(S-VISSR) signals for lower transmission speed 
at CDAS. Then, the data are received at the Medium-scale Data 
Utilization Stations (MDAUS) via GMS-5. The earth data processed 
at DPC are received in the form of WERAX signals with 800 scan lines 
at the Small-scale Data Utilization Stations (SDUS) via GMS-5.

(4) Relay of Search and Rescue (SAR) Signal

 A relay test will be performed to transmit emergency signals (SAR 
signals*) from a distressed ship using GMS-5 as a relay satellite 
to search and rescue organizations.

*SAR signals, originated from the Emergency Locator Trensmitter (ELT) 
for aircraft and the Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon (EPIRB)
for ships are relayed by GMS-5 to the search and rescue organizations.



4.3 System Outline and Major characteristics

4.3.1 Outline

 GMS-5 is a spin-stabilized satellite with mechanical despun antennas. 
The configuration and characteristics of the satellite are based 
on those of GMS/GMS-2/GMS-3/GMS-4 and its major subsystems have adopted 
those of having successful flight experiences.

 The satellite is 444 cm tall (at launch), 354 cm tall (on orbit) and 
215 cm in diameter. It weighs 746 kg at the separation from the H-II 
vehicle and 345 kg on orbit. It consists of a despun earth-oriented 
antenna assembly and a spinning section rotating at 100 rpm. A despun 
antenna provides necessary gain for communications between the satellite 
on orbit and the ground stations. The despun section is controlled by 
earth and sun sensors of the spin section. A noncontacting RF rotary 
joint, mounted coxially within a Despin Bearing Assembly (DBA), feeds RF 
signals between despun antenna snd a spinning equipment shelf.

 The spinning section consists of the forward and the aft. The forward 
assembly carries electronics devices including VISSR, and the aft has 
an Apogee Kick Motor (AKM) and separation hardware. the aft will be 
jettisoned from the satellite body after AKM burnout.

 The satellite mission life and design life are 5 years. Redundancy of 
critical functions to accomplish the mission is provided. The solar 
panel power produces 291 W with the margin of about 22 W at the end of 
5 years (summer solstice).
 The configuration of the satellite is shown in Fig.4-1 and its 
functional blocks in Fig.4-2.

5.4 Structure

 The major structure of the SFU cosisits of an octagonal-shaped 
aluminum alloys truss with detachable box-like payload units (PLUs) 
in which experiments are installed. The core system including attitude 
control, communication and power subsystem stowed in bus units, and 
on-board experimental equipments stowed in the PLUs. The interfaces 
for power, data and communication subsystems between the PLUs and the core 
subsystems are standardized to enable the use of different experimental 
equipments. The SFU solar array paddles, orbital change thruster, 
antennas and attitude control sensors are assembled directly on the 
main structure.
 Fig.5-1 shows the launch and in orbit configurations of SFU. In orbit 
solar array paddles are fully deployed. Fig. 5-2 shows the SFU core 
system.

5.4.1 Navigation, Guidance & Control

 The SFU controls its attitude in a three-axis stabilization. During 
nominal operation, the SFU maintains a sun-pointing mode using solar 
and earth sensors. Its attitude is controlled by reaction wheels, 
magnetic torquer and a Reaction Control Subsystem (RCS) with 3N 
thrusters.
 By using Global Positioning Satellite System (GPS), the SFU can 
automatically recognize its orbital position and velocity without 
any support of ground tracking system. It can also place itself in 
a planned orbit by firing the orbital change thruster after a command 
from the ground station.

5.4.2 Orbit Change Thruster

 The SFU has a unique Orbit Change Thruster (OCT) system. The OCT 
consists of eight 23N thrusters and hydrazine propellant tanks of 
650 kgcapacity. The OCT will be used by the SFU to ascend to its 
missionorbit after launch and descend to the shuttle rendezvous 
orbit forretrieval.

5.4.3 Communication and Data Management

 This system consists of an S-band communication subsystem and a data 
management subsystem with 16-bit micoprocessor. The SFU can transmit 
core system data to the Space Shuttle at a rate of 1 kbps. The SFU 
can transmit telemetry data to the ground station at rates of 1 kbps,
16 kbps and 128 kbps, sending the core system and experiment data 
in real time as well as playback provided by data recorders.
The recorders store 256 time-line commands and 128 timer-commands. 
In addition, four monochromatic still cameras are mounted to the SFU 
to monitor the solar array paddles and other components.

5.4.4 Electric Power

 The electric power system consists of two solar array paddles 
with 28,000 sillicon cells (2 x 4 cm), and four nickel cadminum 
batteries. The paddles are stowed for launch and deployed for 
operation. The power output is more than 2.7 kw at the beginning 
of life. The power system provides the 850w stable power to payload 
experiments and the necessary power to the core system for the 
overall operation of the SFU.

5.5 Operation and Retrieval

 The SFU will be launched in February 1995 by the Third H-II Vehicle.
The SFU will be placed at an altitude of 330 km with an orbital 
inclination of 28.5 deg. The operation of the SFU is shown 
in Fig. 5-3. After being injected into the orbit, the SFU will 
take a sun-pointing mode and deploy its solar array paddles.
After intitial checks, the SFU  will boost up to its operational 
orbit of 500 km using its Orbit Change Thruster (OCT). Because of
aerodynamic drag, the SFU will have to reboost regularly to maintain 
its proper orbit.  During reboosts, the SFU takes and earth-
pointing mode. Following a test period of approximately 7 days, 
on-board experiments will be conducted through time-line commands 
for about 4.5 months.  After completion of their missions, the SFU 
will descend to a phase repeating orbit (orbit repeated same pattern 
relative to ground position) of about 485 km altitude, where it will 
stand by for several months. The SFU will then rendezvous with 
the Space Shuttle at the altitude which will be arranged before 
the Space Shuttle launch.
 When the Space Shuttle is within approximately 20 km from the SFU, 
a communication link is established between the two spacecraft.
The Sagamihara Operation Center (SOC) will issue commands to the Space 
Shuttle which will in turn command the SFU to retract the solar array 
paddles and to go into a safety mode (the securing of all potential 
hazards to personnal, equipments or operations). If the solar array 
paddles do not retract properly, the SOC will issue a command to 
jettison the paddles. Then, the Space Shuttle will make a final 
approach to the SFU, capture the SFU with its robotic arm, and place 
it in the Shuttle cargo bay.  The SFU will switch off the SFU batteries,
and complete its mission before returning to earth.

5.6 Tracking and Control System

  The major ground station for the SFU mission is ISAS's Kagoshima 
Space Center (KSC).  The Okinawa Tracking and Data Acquisition Station 
(OTDS) is the backup ground station during the H-II launch and Space 
Shuttle retrieval phases. OTDS may slso be used as a backup station 
for KSC during the mission phase.  NASA's Deep Space Network stations 
(Goldstone, Canberra,Madrid) and Chile's Stantiago will be in service 
during the launch and retrieval phased (see Fig.5-4).
 ISAS's Sagamihara Operation Center(SOC) will transmit commands and 
monitor telemetry. When the SFU and the Space Shuttle will begin 
direct communication, commands will be given by SOC and the Space 
Shuttle crew, and telemetry data will be  monitored by the Space 
Shuttle crew, NASA's Mission Control Center, and SOC.
