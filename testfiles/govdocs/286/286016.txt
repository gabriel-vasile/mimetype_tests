Description: Redding base line
Year measured: 2008
Chief of party: MH

The base line is located at the Redding Drag Strip adjacent the Redding Municipal Airport in the southeast part of Redding.

The base line is a northwest-southeast line with station 1 on the southeast end.  It consists of the "0", "150", "365", and 
"1234" stations.  The base line runs parallel with the southwesterly edge of the drag strip, within the airport property. 
Do NOT EVER drive on the drag strip.

From the intersection of Interstate 5 and Hwy 44 East/Hwy 299 West at the eastern part of the downtown for the city of Redding, 
take exit 678A for Hwy 44 E and drive east for 0.3 mi to the intersection with Hilltop Dr.  From the intersection of Hwy 44 
and Hilltop Dr, drive SE on Hwy 44 for 3.0 miles to the exit for Airport Road to the south and Old Oregon Trail to the north.  
Drive South on Airport Rd for 1.7 mi to the intersection with Rancho Rd.  Turn left (east) and drive 0.35 mi to the T-intersection 
with Old Oregon Trail.  Turn right on Old Oregon Trail and drive 1.5 mi South to where the road ahead is blocked by a chain 
link fence and Gate 27 of the Airport.  Turn left on Desperado Trail and drive east for 0.25 mi to the where the road curves 
south. Follow the road right, where it is now again Old Oregon Trail, and drive 0.5 mi South where there is a driveway, Gate 20, 
and parking lot for buildings on the right.  Bear left and drive South for 0.1 mi, entering locked Gate 19, for the Redding Drag 
Strip.  The road becomes a lightly oiled gravel road.  Continue south for 0.1 mi and bear right for 0.15 mi following a sign 
toward "Pits".  Turn right (west) and then immediately left on a paved road, and drive South for 0.15 mi, passing a water tank 
on the left, to the start of the spectator bleachers on the left and a paved road.  Continue south for 0.6 mi and then bear right 
and then left for 0.1 mi to the 0-m point on the right.

Note: The 150-m station is a standard NGS CBL disk.  The other 3 stations are Shasta County Surveyor disks, unstamped, with the 
only marking on them being a punch mark surrounded by four lines radiating outward at 90 degree intervals. 

The "0-m" station (aka C) is a 5 cm (2 in) brass Shasta County Surveyor disk set in the top of a concrete post recessed 18 cm 
(7 in) below the surface of the ground.  It is 6.0 ft E of a witness post with an orange paddle labeled "CBL PT C" and 0.6 m

The baseline is located about 2 miles north of the center of the city of Santa Maria, 
about 25 miles south of San Luis Obispo and about 10 mi south of Arroyo Grande.
The baseline is located along the toe of the northern levee of the Santa Maria River,
east of Bonita School Road, on property managed by Santa Barbara Flood Control District.  
To obtain access (locked gate), contact County of Santa Barbara, Public Works Service 
Center in Santa Maria at (805) 568-3440.

To reach the 0-meter point, from Santa Maria to the south, from Hwy 101, take the exit for 
Hwy 166 West (aka E Main St).  Drive west on Hwy 166 for 1.1 mi to the intersection with 
Hwy 135 (aka Broadway Ave). (Key at the County office is about 4 miles south on Hwy 135 
[aka S. Broadway/Orcutt Expressway] and then west on Foster Rd.)  Continue west on Hwy 166 
for 1.0 mi to the intersection with Blosser Rd.  Continue on Hwy 166 for 3.1 mi to the 
intersection with Bonita School Rd, a side road right. Turn right and drive 2.1 mi to the 
north end of the bridge over the Santa Maria River.  At the base of the bridge, make a 
U-turn to the right to the dirt road and pipe gate access.

To reach the 0-meter point, from the north, in the town of Arroyo Grande, from Hwy 101 
(aka El Camino Real) take the Halcyon Road exit, and drive southerly on N Halcyon Rd which 
becomes S Halcyon Rd after crossing State Hwy 227 (aka E Grand Ave). Drive south for a total 
of 1.74 mi to a T-intersection with Hwy 1 (aka Cabrillo Hwy and Cienaga Rd), where the town of 
Oceano is to the right.  Turn left on Hwy 1 and drive east for about 0.6 mi to a 90-degree turn 
in the road, where Valley Road is to the left (north) and Mesa View Dr is to the right (south).  
Follow Hwy 1 to the right and drive southerly for 5.0 miles on Hwy 1 (Mesa View Dr) to where 
the highway makes a 90-degree turn left and becomes Willow Rd.  Follow the highway left 
(and after about 1.25 mi, the highway makes a 90-degree turn right and becomes Guadalupe Rd.), 
and drive a total of 2.8 mi from the start of Willow Rd to the intersection of Oso Flaco Lake Rd, 
a side road left.  Turn left and drive SE toward the town of Nipomo for 2.21 mi to Division St.

The baseline is located 11.0 mi northeast of Yreka, and 4.4 mi north of the town of Montague, and is set at the southwest part 
of Siskiyou County Airport.  The baseline is about 20 mi south of the CA/OR border.

To reach the baseline from the north end of the town of Yreka, from the intersection of Interstate 5 and Hwy 3/Montague Rd, exit 
on Hwy 3 East.  Drive easterly on Hwy 3 for 0.2 mi to the signalized intersection of Juniper Dr.  Continue east on Hwy 3 for 
4.6 mi to a side road left with a sign for the Municipal Airport.  It is NOT this airport. Continue easterly on Hwy 3/Montague Rd, 
for 0.6 mi to a T-intersection with S. 11th St, County Road A28, aka Montague Grenada Road.  Turn left on 11th St and drive 
northeast for 0.3 mi to the intersection with E Webb St.  Turn right on E Webb St and drive easterly for 0.2 mi to the 
intersection with N. 9th St (unsigned) which becomes Airport Rd, and a sign for Siskiyou County Airport.  Turn left and drive 
northeast from E Webb Rd for 3.3 mi on 9th St/Airport Rd to the intersection with Perimeter Rd, a side road right.  Turn right 
and drive east for 0.2 mi to a side road left, before a corrugated steel building and opposite 8624 Perimeter Rd.  Turn left on 
Lower Hangar Rd (unsigned), and follow it to the northeast for about 0.2 mi to a large graveled lot ahead and hangars on the left.  
Turn left, past Bldg 211, a hangar with yellow doors, and drive north on this taxiway for about 0.2 mi to where the road bears right.  
Bear right to follow the road/taxiway and drive 0.4 mi northeast to where the taxiway bears left and a cross-taxiway goes to the 
right.  The "0-m" station is before this intersection on the right.

The base line is a northeast-southwest line with the 0-meter point at the northeast end.  The base line is a four-station line 
consisting of the 0, 150, 430, and 802 meter points.  There is also a 100-ft station southwest of the 0-meter point 
(not measured in 2008).  All stations are set on a line which runs parallel to and along the east edge of the paved taxiway.
