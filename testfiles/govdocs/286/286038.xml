<abstract>The USGS Water Resources Division, along with the Tampa Bay Study Program has established two new surface water advance stations to gather water data within Tampa Bay. One station (Hillsborough Bay Station 1 - ID 275030082274600) will measure water velocity, water level, near-bottom specific conductance and near-bottom water temperature; the second station (Bishop Harbor - ID 273629082341400) will collected those variables previously listed as well as discharge at the mouth of Bishop Harbor. Water level, water velocity, and near-bottom water temperature and specific conductance are measured every 15 minutes. Water level for the Hillsborough Bay station is an eight-second average reading measured at the quarter hour. Water level for the Bishop Harbor station is a ten-second average reading measured at the quarter hour. Water velocity for both stations is a four-minute average that begins two minutes before the quarter hour and ends two minutes after the quarter hour. Velocity time for both stations is reported on the quarter-hour. Near-bottom temperature and specific conductance are ten-second averages. The Bishop Harbor station measurement starts on the quarter hour; for the Hillsborough Bay station, the measurement begins 10 seconds after the quarter hour.</abstract>
<purpose>To collect real-time water data for the Tampa Bay Study Program at two newly established sites. For the Bishop Harbor station - collection of hydrologic data to be used to estimate residence time and hydrodynamic characteristics for the subembayment. For the Hillsborough Bay station - collection of hydrologic data to be used to refine circulation patterns and residence time for the Bay.</purpose>

<attraccr>Accuracy of the measured attributes is dependent on the equipment used to collect the data. For water velocity, the expected accuracy is plus or minus 0.05 feet per second. For water level, the expected accuracy is plus or minus 0.02 feet. For specific conductance, the expected accuracy is less than 3% of the reading. For water temperature, the expected accuracy is 0.2 degrees Centigrade. For the discharge attribute for the Bishop Harbor station, the expected accuracy has not been established.</attraccr>

<logic>All procedures have been followed for the establishment of the two surface water stations.</logic>
<complete>There are no expected gaps in the real time data, barring unforseen complications with equipment or environmental conditions.</complete>

<procdesc>Field installation - For the Hillsborough Bay station, a Campbell Scientific CR10X data logger and SM4M storage module, battery, and sensor wiring are housed in a fiberglass shelter attached to an US Coast Guard Aid to Navigation. Additional equipment consists of a vented pressure sensor (H-310 or equivalent) in a 4 inch PVC stilling weel, a SonTek 1.5 Megahertz ADP vertically oriented velocity profiler moored to the bay bottom approximately 100 feet SSE of the range-markers southwest-most piling, and a temperature/specific conductance sensor (YSI-600-BCR-C-T) positioned one foot above the bottom inside a perforated 4 inch PVC well. For the Bishop Harbor station, a Campbell Scientific CR10X data logger and SM4M storage module, battery, sensor wiring were housed in two fiberglass shelters attached to a 8 inch diameter wood piling. Additional equipment consists of a vented pressure sensor (KPSI 500) in a 4 inch PVC well, a SonTek 3.0 Megahertz Argonaut-XR vertically oriented current sensor moored to the harbor bottom approximately 170 feet SSE of the equipment piling, and a temperature/specific conductance sensor (YSI-600-BCR-C-T) positioned approximately one foot above the bottom inside a perforated 4 inch PVC well attached to the 8 inch diameter wood piling.</procdesc>
