						<p><b>Listening for Echoes from Krill:</b> Though you'll 
							find Dezhang Chu in the biology lab aboard the <i>Nathaniel 
							B. Palmer</i>, he's really a physicist. &quot;I love physics,&quot; 
							Chu smiles. &quot;In physics, you can explain things so 
							perfectly; everything fits; the world is in harmony. 
							Not like biology.&quot;</p>
						<p>Chu, an acoustician from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, 
							would like to bring some of the certainty of physics 
							to biology. Chu's goal aboard the <i>Palmer</i> is 
							to measure two material properties of krill -- density 
							and sound speed -- more directly and accurately than 
							anyone before him. </p>
						<p>These values are notoriously tricky to measure in small, 
							fluid-filled animals like krill. However, they are 
							critical for interpreting acoustical data, such as 
							the data from BIOMAPER-II. </p>
						<p>The echo, or scattered sound, that a marine animal 
							returns to the Bio-Optical Multi-frequency Acoustical 
							and Physical Environmental Recorder (BIOMAPER-II) 
							relates directly to the animal's density and sound 
							speed (the speed at which sound travels through the 
							animal) relative to water. These are such important 
							values to acousticians, they have special shorthand 
							names: &quot;<i>g</i>&quot; and &quot;<i>h</i>,&quot; respectively.</p>
						<p>Scientists use <i>g</i> and <i>h</i> in mathematical 
							models that help translate raw, &quot;fuzzy&quot; acoustical 
							data into estimates of krill abundance. But scientists 
							have been using crude, inconsistent values of <i>g</i> 
							and <i>h</i> for years. </p>
						<p>&quot;If you play with the model for a long time, you see 
							that the prediction of biomass is very sensitive to 
							<i>g</i> and <i>h</i>,&quot; Chu says. Chu found that biomass 
							estimates changed by as much as 100-fold depending 
							on which values of <i>g</i> and <i>h</i> he tried. 
							In other words, one group could be estimating 1000 
							krill when another group was estimating 100,000. </p>
						<p>Chu, along with Woods Hole scientist Peter Wiebe, realized 
							it was imperative to improve estimates of <i>g</i> 
							and <i>h</i>.</p>
						<p>They also realized that these measurements had to be 
							made in the open ocean, not in the lab or in shallow 
							water, as was done in the past. Lab conditions may 
							dry or kill krill, changing their material properties. 
							Material properties might also vary at different depths 
							of the ocean; krill might be more compact at higher 
							pressures or more fatty at colder temperatures, for 
							example. </p>
						<p>As part of this year's SO GLOBEC cruise, Chu is making 
							the first krill <i>g</i> and <i>h</i> measurements 
							ever in open ocean. The first time doing any new science 
							experiment is thorny--the first time in the Antarctic 
							is just plain hard.</p>
						<p>&quot;The big challenge was that I got notice of funding 
							very late before the cruise,&quot; Chu says. &quot;I had to 
							pack everything up very quickly. It was very stressful. 
							Some parts of hardware and some of the software had 
							to be developed here on ship.&quot;</p>
						<p>But Raytheon marine technicians and scientist Karen 
							Reiner of Oregon State University banded together 
							to help Chu trouble-shoot, and soon Chu was in business. 
						</p>
						<p><b>Weighing Krill: No Easy Task</b></p>
						<p>Measuring density seems straightforward: measure the 
							animal's weight, measure its volume, and divide. But 
							it's not that simple with tiny sea animals. Krill 
							are mostly composed of water. If you take them out 
							of water to measure them, they lose volume and weight 
							due to drying. But if you keep them moist, they carry 
							extra water, adding weight. </p>
						<p>The trick is to measure density without ever measuring 
							the volume and weight of the animal directly, Chu 
							says. </p>
						<p>To demonstrate the method, he holds up a small jar 
							of amphipods--tiny, fly-like creatures of the sea, 
							with translucent skin and dark beady eyes. Suspended 
							in their native seawater, they form a thick, raw stew 
							of paralyzed zooplankton. &quot;They're pretty ugly, aren't 
							they?&quot; Chu says with a grin. </p>
						<p>Chu weighs the jar of amphipods on a sensitive balance 
							beam scale that has been cleverly rigged to function 
							when rocking. Then Reiner carefully adds distilled 
							water to the jar -- to just the right volume. Chu 
							re-weighs the new mixture. Together they filter out 
							the little water bugs and measure the density of the 
							remaining water mixture. </p>
						<p>Armed with the information he needs, Chu does a little 
							algebra, and out pops the density of amphipods. He'll 
							do the same with fresh samples of krill later.</p>
						<p>Chu measures <i>h</i>, or sound speed contrast, with 
							APOP (Acoustical Properties Of zooPlankton), a device 
							he designed. The APOP system is housed in a stainless 
							steel pail that can be lowered into the ocean so that 
							<i>h</i> can be measured at many depths. Currently, 
							APOP contains a pair of cylindrical tubes with transducers 
							at the ends and a live animal chamber in between. 
							Chu sends sound waves from the transmitter to the 
							receiver with and without live krill in the chamber.</p>
						<p>Thin-shelled and diaphanous, the krill blend in with 
							the water except for their tiny dark eyes and the 
							reddish outlines of their shrimp-like forms. As the 
							sound waves travel through the water and hit the krill, 
							they are slightly accelerated. When the krill are 
							absent, the sound waves take longer to arrive at the 
							receiver. </p>
						<p>The difference in arrival time is directly related 
							to the sound speed difference between krill and water, 
							and can be used to calculate <i>h</i>.</p>
						<p>&quot;So far, so good,&quot; Chu says after the fifth APOP cast. 
							To this point, Chu has observed that <i>h</i> depends 
							on the life stages of krill, but not on water depth. 
							&quot;That's very encouraging. At least it's consistent 
							with what people thought.&quot;</p>
						<p>And, for Chu, it's all about making biology more consistent.
