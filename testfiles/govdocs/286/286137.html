        <p>NOAA marine mammal scientists have deployed an array of buoys, packing
          equipment that will track large whales throughout NOAA&rsquo;s Gerry
          E. Studds<a href="http://stellwagen.noaa.gov/"> Stellwagen Bank National
          Marine Sanctuary</a> off Massachusetts by listening for their vocal
          sounds. Researchers want people to know what the buoys look like and
          how to return one, should it be found after an unintentional release.</p>
        <p>The buoys are moored to the ocean bottom -- remaining fully submerged
          -- and &ldquo;pop-up&rdquo; to
          the ocean surface so that data can be downloaded and batteries refreshed.
          Although programmed to pop-up automatically after three months, a release
          can also be triggered by a retrieval team using a hand-held transponder. </p>
        <p>Buoy data is critical to the success of the study. If a buoy is lost,
          then so are the data it has collected. &ldquo;There are a number of
          ways that a buoy could slip its mooring. Storms, equipment failure,
          or snagging during fishing operations, are all possible,&rdquo; said
          Dr. Richard Merrick of NOAA&rsquo;s National Marine Fisheries Service&rsquo;s<a href="http://www.nefsc.noaa.gov/"> Northeast
          Fisheries Science Center</a>, one of the project partners. </p>
        <p>The buoys are round, and encased in bright yellow &ldquo;hard-hat&rdquo; plastic
          measuring about 20 inches in diameter and weighing about 45 pounds.
          Buoys are marked with a red and white placard that gives contact information
          for returning the buoy if found. There is also a $250 reward for returns.</p>
        <p> The <a href="#chart">buoy locations</a> were selected both for water depth and coverage
          area. &ldquo;We tried to pick places that would be least affected by
          fishing or weather, but also had to make sure that whale sounds throughout
          the sanctuary could be captured,&rdquo; said Dr. David Wiley, research
          coordinator for the sanctuary, and another partner in the work. </p>
        <p>The buoys record a <a href="http://www.birds.cornell.edu/brp/SoundsMarMamm.html"> whale&rsquo;s
            vocalization</a>, and the date and time it was made. By comparing
            the times when the sound was recorded by different buoys, researchers
            can also calculate the location of the whale when it made the sound.
            The effort is the first to attempt year-long comprehensive acoustic
            coverage of a national marine sanctuary and will focus on tracking
            Northern right whales, a highly endangered species. Scientists hope
            to create a portrait of localized right whale migrations throughout
          the year. </p>
        <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve tracked right whales with these devices in the
          summer in Cape Cod Bay, and elsewhere off Massachusetts for months,
          but not a whole year,&rdquo; said Dr. Chris Clark of the Bioacoustics
          Research Program at Cornell University&rsquo;s Laboratory of Ornithology,
          a third partner in the project. Clark&rsquo;s group developed the acoustic
          buoys being used.</p>
        <p>Large whales, particularly Northern right whales, can be seriously
          injured or killed in collisions with ships and entanglement in fishing
          gear. This year&rsquo;s work in the sanctuary is part of a larger project
          that researchers believe may lead to a practical way of keeping real-time
          track of large ships and whales in the area. &ldquo;If we can do that,&rdquo; said
          Merrick, &ldquo;we then have a better chance of substantially reducing
          the risk of collisions with whales.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>NOAA Fisheries Service is dedicated to protecting and
              preserving our nation's living marine resources and their habitats
              through scientific research, management and enforcement. NOAA Fisheries
              Service provides effective stewardship of these resources for the
            benefit of the nation, supporting coastal communities that depend
          upon them,
              and helping to provide safe and healthy seafood to consumers and
            recreational opportunities for the American public. </p>
        <p> The NOAA National Marine Sanctuary Program seeks to increase public
            awareness of America&rsquo;s ocean and Great Lakes treasures by conducting
            scientific research, monitoring, exploration and educational programs.&nbsp; Today,
            the program manages 13 national marine sanctuaries and one coral
            reef ecosystem reserve that together encompass more than 150,000
            square miles of America&rsquo;s ocean and Great Lakes natural and
            cultural resources.</p>
        <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, an agency of
            the U.S. Commerce Department, is dedicated to enhancing economic
          security and national safety through the prediction and research of
          weather and climate-related events and providing environmental stewardship
            of our nation's coastal and marine resources. Through the emerging
            Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS), NOAA is working
            with its federal partners and nearly 60 countries to develop a global
            monitoring network that is as integrated as the planet it observes. </p>
