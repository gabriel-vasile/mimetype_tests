    <h1><a name="haru" id="haru"></a>Interview with Dr. Haru Matsumoto</h1> 
    <p><em>Interview by William Hanshumaker</em></p>
    <p><strong>Bill:</strong> What did you learn from this mission?        </p>
    <p><strong>Haru:</strong> This was our first experience with the deployment of hydrophones in
          the high southern latitudes area off Antarctica. Hydrophones are
          computerized microphones that record sounds created underwater by
          earthquakes, volcanoes, moving ice flows, and even the large whales. But
          floating icebergs, unusual sound paths, and the notoriously rough weather in
          the Drake Passage create conditions that complicate interpreting the sound
          patterns. Due to cracking ice, the ambient sound may be much noisier than at
          the mid-latitudes. Floating ice could deflect or absorb distant sounds. We
          are optimistic that we have prepared for these challenges but will not know
          for sure until next winter. In November 2006, we will go back to the
          Antarctic to recover the Autonomous Underwater Hydrophones (AUHs) and
          decipher their recorded sonograms. Only then will we know how well our
          hydrophones performed and if our assumptions are correct.      </p>
    <p><strong>Bill:</strong> What advice would you give to students who are interested in ocean
            engineering?            </p>
    <p><strong>Haru:</strong> The technology is advancing at such a fast pace that even concepts of
              how to design and build a system changes every five years. It is a
              challenge to stay current in this field. The good news is that the basics
              do not change even with technological advances. What helped the most in my
              career was a strong background in math and physics, which I received when I
              was an undergraduate student in Japan. When a new technology emerges, it is
              easier to adapt to the changes if you've mastered the basics in math and
              physics. The goal is to quickly apply the new technology to your field.      </p>
    <p><strong>Bill:</strong> Where did you go to school?      </p>
    <p><strong>Haru:</strong> My undergraduate degree is from Tokai University, Japan, and I earned
                  a PhD in Ocean Engineering from the University of Hawaii.      </p>
    <p><strong>Bill:</strong> Why did you decide to study ocean engineering? </p>
    <p><strong>Haru:</strong> I graduated high school in mid 1970s. Back then, the Apollo program
                  had just ended, and public interest was shifting towards the oceans. Born
                  and raised near the Pacific, I was always interested in underwater
                  technology. The concepts of underwater habitat, ocean thermal energy
                  conversion, and underwater communication fascinated me. I was also an
                  electronically savvy kid. I built my own ham radios and Hi-Fi amplifiers
                  with components that often came from junkyard. I consider myself lucky
                  because ocean engineering was just the right match for me.      </p>
    <p><strong>Bill:</strong> What part of your job you like the most?                    </p>
    <p><strong>Haru:</strong> I really appreciate being at an academic institution
      where I can enjoy the atmosphere of freedom. It allows me to generate my
      own ideas. I can even investigate unique ideas that may not demonstrate
      an immediate profit, but may benefit the environment in the long run. What
      satisfies me the most being part of a team that is very effective and consistently
      produces results.</p>

    <p><strong><a name="sara" id="sara"></a>Interview with Sara Heimlich</strong></p>
    <p><em>Interview by William Hanshumaker</em></p>
    <p><strong>Bill:</strong> Why was a marine mammal specialist part of the expedition?</p>
    <p><br />
      <strong>Sara</strong>: The hydrophones we deployed will record sounds from
      1Hz to 110Hz.&nbsp; This
range includes the low-frequency vocalizations made by large whales- particularly
blue whales.&nbsp; We also get sounds from fin, sperm, Sei and Bryde's
whales, but our regular hydrophones only record the lower end of their full range.
Only one of the hydrophones we deployed is capable of recording higher frequencies
up to 440 Hz. This should help us get recordings of the upper ranges of whale
calls, and perhaps even sounds from marine mammal species we have not previously
recorded.&nbsp; When we analyze the hydrophone data next year, it will be very
important to learn what sounds might be from marine mammals that live or migrate
through the study area.&nbsp; While there is some information from reports from
other expeditions and ships, it was important to have a marine mammal specialist
participate in this expedition so that we would have an exact documentation of
the marine mammal species at the sites where we placed the hydrophones.&nbsp; When
we analyze the data, we will have a much better idea of what sounds might be
from what species we know for certain we saw while deploying the hydrophones.&nbsp; </p>

      <hr width="30%" size="1" noshade="noshade" />
    </div>
    <p><strong>Bill:</strong> What did you learn from this mission?</p>
    <p><strong>Sara:</strong>&nbsp; This was my first opportunity to observe
      marine mammals and birds in the Antarctic.&nbsp; It was fantastic to see
      species that I have only read about, but even more wonderful to see species
      in the Antarctic that I have observed in so many other places in the world:
      like humpback whales which I had just seen in the tropical Pacific not
      much earlier in the year, and here they were in the cold southern waters
      only a couple of months later.&nbsp; Our data from the hydrophones will
      add to our understanding of whale movements and migrations of species like
      humpbacks and blue whales that move over vast distances.&nbsp; It will
      also give us some insight to sounds that might correspond to specific behaviors.&nbsp; I
      observed lunge-feeding Minke whales right in the area where we deployed
      the high-frequency hydrophone.&nbsp; This is really great because, since
      our regular hydrophones can only record the lower end of their vocalizations,
      we'll finally have data which will let us describe more of their vocal
      range, both the extent of their sounds and what they might mean in terms
      of behavior.&nbsp; I
      also observed several pairs and trios of humpback whales and some other
      rorqual species in Drake Passage; throughout the couple of hours it took
      us to deploy the hydrophone we placed there.&nbsp; So, we are guaranteed
      to have recordings of at least three or four whale species, and probably
      different kinds of sounds that might correlate to large and small-scale
      behaviors.</p>
    <p><strong>Bill:</strong> What advice would you give to students who are interested in marine
      mammals?</p>
    <p><br />
      <strong>Sara:</strong> This is a field that is evolving very quickly.&nbsp; It
      is important to understand the environment where marine mammals live.&nbsp; I
      strongly recommend focusing on oceanography or some other marine science
      program.&nbsp; You
      just can not understand the animals unless you understand the complex
      world where they live.&nbsp; Technology is used in even the most basic
      observational studies, so I would also recommend developing a strong background
      in computer skills, math, and statistics, starting as early as high school
      if possible. I did not become seriously involved with marine mammal
      work until after I finished my undergraduate college degree in Art and
      Biology.&nbsp; I felt very handicapped and it was tough to make up the
      holes in my education during my Master's work. Exposure to and development
      of some basic skills in the 'hard core basic sciences' early
      on (no matter how much of a struggle it seems) will provide an essential
      foundation.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<strong>Bill:</strong> Where did you go to school?</p>
    <p><br />
      <strong>Sara:</strong> My undergraduate degree is in Art and Biology from
      The Evergreen State College in Olympia Washington. I conducted all my graduate
      work at Moss Landing Marine Laboratories in California, earning my Master's
      degree in Marine Sciences from the University of California at San Jose
      State.&nbsp; My Master's Thesis was on the social organization of
      killer whales, looking at long-term relationships within and between pods,
      and their matrilineal structure.</p>
    <p><strong>Bill:</strong> Why did you decide to study marine mammals, particularly cetaceans?&nbsp; How
    did you become an acoustician?</p>
    <p><br />
      <strong>Sara:</strong>&nbsp; Seals, whales and dolphins have evolved unique
      and amazing adaptations for living in what is essentially an environment
      alien to the mammalian form.&nbsp; Whales and dolphins are especially fascinating
      in that they spend no time whatsoever on land, where all the rest of the
      mammalian orders live- even seals.&nbsp; I was always interested in animal
      behavior and evolution, and I was always drawn to the ocean.&nbsp; I have
      to admit that I grew up watching 'Flipper' which was probably
      an early influence.&nbsp; But, when I was in high school there were very
      few women in the marine sciences, so I did not even think about it
      as a serious option.&nbsp; During my undergraduate years, two male friends
      started working on a killer whale project in Puget Sound and I would visit
      them fairly regularly.&nbsp; I went to one of the first Marine Mammal Society
      meetings with them, where I met some of the few women who were successfully
      pursuing careers in marine mammal science; it was then I realized that
      this was a viable choice.&nbsp; My early work was looking at social organization
      and behavioral ecology. How cetaceans use sound acoustics was a natural
      progression from there.&nbsp; I have been with the Acoustics group of NOAA's
      Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory's VENTS program since 2001,
      working principally on the acoustic characteristics of cetacean vocalizations
    and secondarily on seismic activity.</p>
    <p><strong>Bill:</strong> What part of your job you like the most?</p>
    <p><br />
      <strong>Sara:</strong> When I was younger, it was the fieldwork.&nbsp; Now
      it is analyzing data because it reveals such interesting results.&nbsp; Being
      at an academic institution lets me work on really innovative research that
      benefits our understanding of the ocean environment in a way that I could
      not have done by myself.&nbsp; I have to agree with Haru Matsumoto: much
      of my satisfaction comes from being part of a team that is innovative,
      effective and consistently produces results. </p>
