<p><strong>AGENCY:</strong> Architectural and Transportation Barriers
Compliance Board.</p>

<p><strong>ACTION:</strong> Request for Information.</p>

<p><strong>SUMMARY:</strong> The Architectural and Transportation Barriers
Compliance Board has received a petition for rulemaking from a
parent of a child with a hearing loss requesting that the ADA
Accessibility Guidelines be amended to include new provisions for
acoustical accessibility in schools for children who are hard of
hearing. Several acoustics professionals, parents of children
with hearing impairments, individuals who are hard of hearing,
and a consortium of organizations representing them have also
urged the Board to consider research and rulemaking on the
acoustical performance of buildings and facilities, in particular
school classrooms and related student facilities. The Board seeks
comment on the issues outlined in this request for information.
After evaluating responses to this request for information, the
Board will determine a course of action. Alternatives under
consideration include research, rulemaking, and technical
assistance on acoustical issues.</p>

<p><strong>DATES:</strong> Comments should be received by July 31, 1998.
Late comments will be considered to the extent practicable.</p>

<p><strong>ADDRESSES:</strong> Comments should be sent to the Office of

<h4>Background</h4>

<p>The Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>
(Access Board) is responsible for developing accessibility
guidelines under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990
(ADA) to ensure that new construction and alterations of
facilities covered by the law are readily accessible to and
usable by individuals with disabilities. The Access Board
initially issued the Americans with Disabilities Act
Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG) in 1991. The guidelines contain
scoping provisions and technical specifications for designing
elements and spaces that typically comprise a building and its
site so that individuals with disabilities will have ready access
to and use of a facility.</p>

<p>Although ADAAG contains a number of provisions for access to
communications, including requirements for text telephones,
assistive listening systems, and visible alarms, it does not
include provisions for the acoustical design or performance of
spaces within buildings and facilities. The Department of Justice
(DOJ) regulations implementing titles II and III of the ADA
contain additional requirements for communications with
individuals with disabilities and for auxiliary aids and devices
to aid in communication.<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>On April 6, 1997, the Access Board received a petition for rulemaking from a parent of
a child with a severe to profound hearing loss requesting that
the Board address &quot;architectural acoustics in schools&quot;
and develop &quot;new rules&quot; for children who are hard-
of-hearing. The petition argues that children who have hearing
and other disabilities, including learning, auditory processing,
speech and language, and developmental disabilities, face
numerous communications barriers in schools because of poor
acoustics and that these barriers may prevent them from receiving
a meaningful education. The petition requests that the Board
develop &quot;acoustical guidelines...[to] ensure adequately low
noise and reverberation so that the speech-to-noise ratio and
speech-to-reverberation ratio allow satisfactory communication
and learning.&quot;</p>

<p>A consortium of organizations representing persons with
disabilities (Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf,
Inc., the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA),
Auditory-Verbal International, Inc., the National Center for Law
and Deafness, the National Cued Speech Association, and Self Help
for Hard of Hearing People (SHHH)) submitted comments to the
Board in previous rulemakings asserting that a poor acoustical
environment is as significant a barrier to individuals with
hearing, speech, and language impairments as stairs are to
persons who use wheelchairs.</p>

<p>The consortium's comments included a position paper on
acoustics in educational settings developed by ASHA in 1994. The
paper cited data on the increasing prevalence of hearing loss,
particularly among children and young adults, and reported on
research that identified children with mild hearing losses as
more at risk for general psychosocial dysfunction and lags in
academic progress than were children with normal hearing. Other
cited studies showed the relationship between poor room acoustics
and low speech comprehension in children with hearing, learning,
and developmental disabilities. Reverberant classrooms with high
ambient noise levels were identified as significant contributors
to communications difficulties. The position paper included a
number of recommendations for the acoustical performance of
classrooms to improve conditions for listening, hearing, and
understanding speech.</p>

<p>Other commenters to ADAAG rulemakings noted that the acoustics
of many restaurants adversely affected the ability of individuals
who are hard of hearing to communicate with companions and with
service staff. In response, the Access Board contracted with
Batelle, a research organization in Columbus, OH, to study
improved speech communication for persons with hearing
impairments in dining areas. A literature study, post-occupancy
evaluations of several facilities, and recommendations were
developed by Batelle engineers and reviewed by an eight-member
advisory panel. The authors identified background noise levels
and reverberation as the acoustical characteristics most subject
to design and construction manipulation and most significant for
adequate speech communication. Several panel members suggested
that other facility types, particularly schools, could benefit
from the application of such acoustical requirements.</p>

<h4>Hearing Loss and Other Disabilities</h4>

<p>Government health statistics document that more Americans
report a hearing loss than any other disability, and the
incidence of hearing loss has increased significantly in the last
25 years. A recent assessment by the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) found that 13% of a representative sample of
children between the ages of 6 and 19 had a high frequency
hearing loss and 7% a low frequency hearing loss of 16 dB or
more, a level at which perceiving and understanding words would
be affected.</p>

<p>Increasing numbers of young children experience mild temporary
and recurring hearing loss caused by otitis media, an
inflammation of the middle ear that is the most frequent medical
diagnosis for children. Research also shows that children with
learning, speech, and developmental disabilities have a higher
incidence of abnormal hearing and of repeated instances of ear
problems. &quot;Hearing Loss: The Journal of Self Help for Hard
of Hearing People&quot; reported in 1997 that one-fourth to
one-third of the students in typical kindergarten and first-grade
classrooms will not hear normally on a given day.</p>

<h4>Speech Communication</h4>

<p>Effective speech reception--understanding, not just
hearing--is the primary educational issue for people with
auditory disabilities. A Cornell University study published in
the journal &quot;Environment and Behavior&quot; indicates that
excessive classroom noise impedes the acquisition of language and
cognitive skills by all children. The acquisition of language is
necessary for brain and intellectual development. Research with
children who are deaf has shown that the mastery of a system of
communication is essential to future learning and that failure to
acquire effective language skills by the age of six cannot be
fully remediated.</p>

<p>Language acquisition is dependent in large part upon exposure
to an organized system of communication, such as a signed,
voiced, or tactile language. For children who will use voice
communication, the intelligibility of the spoken language is a
critical factor. Speech intelligibility is a measure of the
proportion of the spoken message that gets through to the
listener, and is affected by signal volume, the distance between
the speaker and listener, and the acoustic characteristics of the
room, including background noise levels and reverberation time.</p>

<p>A large body of clinical and scientific research supports the
particular need for good acoustics in teaching environments. The
Acoustical Society of America (ASA) has established a Classroom
Acoustics Subcommittee of its Architectural Acoustics Committee
that has held four symposia on classroom acoustics issues. At an
ASA conference held in June 1997, researchers presented evidence
that excessive noise levels impair a young child's speech
perception, reading and spelling ability, behavior, attention,
and overall academic performance.</p>

<p>Because the ability to understand speech does not mature in
children before the age of 15, children are less effective
listeners generally than are adults. Additionally, children have
less experience in deriving meaning from context. A
representative sample of children without hearing loss or other
audiological disability, even when tested in above-average
listening environments, could make out only 71% of a teacher's
words. Those in the worst environments ?got' only 30% of the
message directed at them.</p>

<p>The listening abilities of children with hearing impairments,
particularly those with mild to moderate hearing loss, are even
more affected by poor acoustics than are those of children whose
hearing falls within normal ranges. A 1997 study of children with
minimal sensorineural hearing loss showed lower scores for basic
skills and communications testing and a high rate--37%--of
retention in grade. In addition, these students functioned below
normally hearing children in evaluations of behavior, energy,
stress, social support, and self-esteem. Other studies have shown
that children with learning and developmental disabilities
perform less effectively in noisy spaces.</p>

<p>In their chapter on &quot;Speech Perception in Specific
Populations&quot; (from the book &quot;Sound-Field FM
Amplification&quot;), Drs. Carl Crandell, Joseph Smaldino, and
Carol Flexer have identified at-risk populations as young
students generally (less than 13-15 years of age); children who
have a history of otitis media, children for whom English is a
second language, and children with auditory disabilities,
including those with hearing loss, central auditory processing
deficits, learning disabilities, developmental delay, and
attention, speech, and language disorders.</p>

<h4>Acoustical Performance of Rooms and Spaces</h4>

<p>In analyzing how effectively an individual can hear and
understand in a given space, an acoustician or audiologist will
consider three criteria: distance from the sound source (the
'signal'), the level of background sound (noise), and the effects
of reverberation. By controlling background noise levels and room
reverberation time, designers can provide good speech
intelligibility, measured by the signal-to-noise ratio. The
signal-to-noise ratio is the relationship between the loudness of
the message and the background sound it must overcome to be heard
and understood. A significantly positive signal-to-noise ratio is
necessary for maximum performance where room sound levels are
high; children with hearing impairments require a higher
signal-to-noise ratio than do children with normal hearing.</p>

<p>Distance from the source has a significant effect on
signal-to-noise ratio, since the loudness of a direct sound falls
off in proportion to the distance between the speaker and
listener. Children with hearing impairments and other
disabilities affecting listening need to maintain a consistent
and close relationship with the sound source. Speech
intelligibility can be enhanced by delivery and performance
styles, by the use of reflective surfaces at the speaking
location, and by amplification.</p>

<p>Background noise--whether from heating, ventilating, and air
conditioning (HVAC) systems, other noise generated within the
space, or outside noise--also interferes with effective listening
because it competes with the spoken message. High background
noise values across the frequencies of speech (500 to 2000 Hz)
require louder speech signals to overcome. Background noise (or
ambient sound) design criteria are typically expressed as a range
between two noise criteria (NC) curves, which plot sound levels
across 8 standard frequencies. Sound levels in existing spaces
can be tested at these frequencies using a sound meter. The NC
rating for a room is typically between 5 to 10 points below the
dBA reading. Design engineers can specify HVAC equipment with low
noise ratings and limit sound generated by system operation in a
variety of ways. Rooms and spaces can be protected from unwanted
exterior sound by mass, insulation, and isolation in wall and
slab construction and by minimizing (or sound protecting)
openings.</p>

<p>Reverberation--reflected sound that persists within a room or
space--also masks the sound of the spoken message and increases
background sound levels. The longer the reverberation time, the
greater the effect. Reverberation is expressed in seconds (R60),
measured as the time it takes for sound to decay 60 dB after the
source has stopped producing it. Reverberation is a function of
the physical properties of the room and can be calculated if the
volume, surface area, and surface absorbencies of a space are
known. Reverberation can be controlled by a manipulation of the
absorbency of surfaces within a space and the proportions and
volume of the space.</p>

<p>When reverberation time and background noise are controlled,
speech effort and sound levels decline, leading to a reduction in
room noise. It has been estimated that over 90% of those who have
a hearing loss have usable residual hearing and would benefit
from an enhanced speech environment. Where classrooms and child
care centers do not provide acceptable listening conditions, even
amplification will not achieve maximum effect in improving speech
communication. Poor acoustics can also compromise the
effectiveness of personal hearing aids and devices and limit the
usefulness of auxiliary aids and services. Good acoustics can
enhance the usefulness of such aids and improve listener
reception of unamplified speech, as may occur in group
interchange. Because most mild hearing losses in children are not
diagnosed, children with such losses (15-25 dB), including those
with temporary hearing loss due to otitis media, will not
generally be using amplification devices.</p>

<p>Many groups concerned with the acoustics of educational
environments recommended that new implementing regulations for
the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), currently
being developed by the U.S. Department of Education, require that
services for covered students be delivered in an acoustically
appropriate environment. Two cases have been reported to the
Board in which IDEA or Rehabilitation Act decisions directed that
the room acoustics in existing school classrooms be improved to
accommodate children with hearing loss. Requirements that
students with disabilities be educated in the least restrictive
environment mean that every classroom is likely to have a
youngster with a diagnosed auditory disability in attendance;
additionally, during the course of a school year, many children
will be temporarily affected by mild and possibly recurring
hearing loss associated with otitis media and other illnesses.</p>

<h4>Classroom Acoustics</h4>

<p>Studies of classrooms around the country and test data
submitted by parents and acoustical consultants indicate that
classrooms and day care facilities are not being designed to
provide adequate speech intelligibility even for children without
auditory impairments. Research on seven child-care facilities in
Canada documented noise conditions in four centers that exceeded
the 75 dB limit considered safe for day-long exposure for adults
by the World Health Organization. Open plan centers had
particularly excessive noise levels and were reported to have
more health problems among children and staff as well as other
disadvantages. Acoustical treatment that reduced reverberation
time in the noisiest setting from 1.6 seconds to .6 seconds
resulted in a 5 dB decrease in sound level and staff assessments
of substantial improvement in comfort. A 1994 survey of school
facility conditions conducted by the General Accounting Office
(GAO) reported that poor acoustics were ranked by administrators
as the most significant problem affecting the learning
environment. Twenty-eight percent of responding schools
identified acoustics for noise control as being unsatisfactory or
very unsatisfactory. Eleven million children were estimated to be
affected. Of these, CDC estimates suggest, more than a million
and a half children may have a temporary or permanent hearing
loss.</p>

<h4>Acoustical Design Standards and Guidelines</h4>

<p>Reverberation and background noise limits are common elements
in existing acoustical standards, recommendations, and
good-practice guidelines for classroom design and construction.
Audiometry rooms and educational classrooms designed specifically
for persons with auditory impairments have short reverberation
times and very low background noise levels. Similar requirements
are applied to rooms such as broadcast and recording studios,
including teleconferencing facilities, where speech communication
is the primary function, and in sound testing facilities such as
anechoic chambers. Low background noise and short reverberation
times contribute to positive sound-to-noise ratios, maximal sound
transmission indices, and high speech intelligibility values.</p>

<p>Achievements in the design of concert hall acoustics and
specialized environments for materials testing and measurement
demonstrate that good hearing environments can be accomplished
with current design, modeling, construction, and testing
procedures. It appears that a consensus on the general scope and
content of acoustical performance criteria for classrooms is
developing among audiologists, acousticians, and consumers and
that existing acoustical guidelines for educational and other
facilities may be adaptable for incorporation into ADAAG.</p>

<p>While some factors--for instance, a rise in exterior noise
levels due to a change in nearby noise sources--are beyond the
control of the design professional, 'bad' acoustics are largely
architectural problems, solvable by architectural means.
Architects and other design professionals routinely practice
simple acoustical design procedures in specifying floor, wall,
and ceiling finishes. Acousticians are regularly retained for the
more demanding design and engineering of music and performance
facilities. Several software programs are available to model the
acoustical performance of spaces that have been designed but not
built. Criteria for the acoustical design of spaces are widely
available in textbooks and technical publications.</p>

<p>Acoustical testing protocols are developed and maintained by
several private sector organizations. The American Society of
Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE)
issues standards that include the acoustical performance of
equipment installed in buildings and facilities. The American
National Standards Institute (ANSI), in conjunction with the ASA,
has established several protocols for the measurement of room
sound levels, including ANSI S12.2 Criteria for Room Noise
Measurement. ANSI has recently established a committee to develop
a classroom acoustics standard. Foreign and international
standards also exist. Model codes contain both standards and
requirements for sound-rated construction components in
multi-family housing and other occupancy types. The developers
and operators of hotel, medical, and housing facilities typically
establish similar acoustical standards for sound transmission
through floors, walls, structure, and HVAC systems.</p>

<p>&quot;Architectural Acoustics&quot;, by M. David Egan
(McGraw-Hill, Inc., 1988), a standard reference work for design
professionals, recommends a background noise level of less than
20 dB (NC-20) for critical music performance (including broadcast
and recording studios) and audiological spaces; a range of NC-20
to NC-30 for less demanding, speech-focused halls and rooms, and
NC-30 to NC-35 for classrooms. Recommended reverberation limits
range between 0.6 and 0.8 seconds. The author notes, however,
that NC curves to provide satisfactory listening environments for
persons with hearing impairments need to be lower by 5 (resulting
in a recommendation of NC-25 to NC-30 for classrooms serving
adults with hearing loss). Egan recommends that reverberation
time in such rooms should not exceed 0.5 seconds.</p>

<p>The ASA recommends an average reverberation time in classrooms
between 0.6 seconds minimum and 0.8 seconds maximum; ambient room
noise, when measured without occupants, between 30 dBA minimum
and 35 dBA maximum; room criteria (RC) curve--used to measure
HVAC and equipment-generated noise--should not exceed RC- 25, and
the signal-to-noise ratio should be able to achieve +15 dB. The
ASA has recently established a multi-committee initiative to work
on the development of guidelines for acoustics. A workshop
seminar was held in Los Angeles in December 1997 to begin the
process of developing consensus recommendations.</p>

<p>The ASHA recommends that noise levels in unoccupied classrooms
not exceed 30 dBA (or a NC-20 curve) and that reverberation time
not exceed 0.4 seconds across speech frequencies. Signal-to-noise
ratios (measured at the student's ear) should exceed +15 dB.</p>

<p>Dr. Crandell, et al, recommend that elementary and secondary
school classrooms for 'at-risk' students should have unoccupied
ambient noise levels that do not exceed NC- 25 or a sound
pressure level of 35 dBA and a reverberation time that does not
exceed .4 seconds in the speech frequency range.</p>

<p>Portugal's classroom noise standards, adopted in 1988, limit
reverberation time in general classrooms to 0.6 - 0.8 seconds and
in special classrooms to 0.6 seconds; equipment background noise
may not exceed 35 dBA. Wall construction between classrooms must
have a sound transmission class (STC) rating of at least 50 dB.
The Swedish Board of Housing, Building and Planning has adopted
Building Regulations BBR 94, with amendments, that include
detailed guidelines for protection against noise for several
building types, including schools, by means of specified areas of
sound absorbent surfaces within classrooms, acoustical isolation
between classrooms, and limits on background noise from building
systems and equipment.</p>

<p>The State of Washington Department of Health rules, WAC
248-64-320 Sound Control, include a limit (NC-35) on background
noise in classrooms. The Los Angeles County Unified School
District--the largest in the world in numbers of students
enrolled-- has recently adopted a similar standard for the noise
output of classroom HVAC equipment. ANSI S12.2-1995 suggests an
NC range of 25-30 for classrooms and an RC in the same range. A
tabular comparison of values for acoustical criteria in
classrooms is presented in <a href="#Table">Table 1</a>.</p>

<p>Other bases for prescribing and testing acoustical
characteristics, including values for speech-to-noise ratio and
the speech transmission index (STI), may be applied to diagnose
existing acoustical conditions in classrooms, but do not appear
useful in a new construction standard. The STI takes into account
the effects of noise and reverberation and can be adjusted to
obtain values for listeners with hearing impairments. Both rely
on in-use measurements.</p>

<h4>Cost</h4>

<p>High-performing acoustical environments are achieved at some
premium in construction cost. Knowledgeable design, construction,
and materials specification, an investment in high-quality HVAC
equipment, and careful installation and workmanship are required
to ensure that design values are reflected in performance.
Special consideration of room configuration, proportion, and
location may also be necessary. Furthermore, the measures
necessary to control sound in classrooms may raise other issues
affecting cost. For instance, carpeting is recommended to add
absorbency for reverberation control and to minimize the
self-noise of student movement. However, carpeting may require a
change in maintenance procedures. Controlling ambient noise in
many urban schools may require that windows be kept closed even
in pleasant weather, when HVAC systems might operate at lesser
capacities. Students with moderate to severe hearing impairments
may also require the use of amplification systems to increase
speech intelligibility to effective values.</p>

<h4>ADAAG Criteria</h4>

<p>To be useful, acoustical recommendations and standards should
employ design techniques, data, and sound measurement protocols
available and familiar to architecture, engineering, and
construction practitioners and applicable during design phases.
Like a building code, ADAAG is intended for use in new
construction and alterations of buildings and facilities. It
contains provisions for construction elements, items, and
finishes that are fixed to the building structure. Furniture and
equipment, including portable communications devices, are covered
by the DOJ regulation, not ADAAG.</p>

<p>The Board recognizes that amplification technologies may be
required for effective communications in some rooms and spaces
and for some individuals. Such solutions, including those that
use portable assistive listening systems and sound field
technology, are beyond the scope of the building and facility
provisions in ADAAG. However, such technologies cannot be fully
effective in noisy environments; amplification in highly
reverberant environments will exacerbate listening and hearing
problems. Furthermore, the effectiveness of personal devices,
particularly hearing aids, is also compromised in noisy
environments. And, because the learning environment includes
interaction with peers and other individuals in classrooms and
other settings, instructor amplification only may not fully
remove barriers to hearing, listening, and learning where
acoustical design is flawed.</p>

<p>Based upon public comments to this notice and on information
already available and outlined in this notice, the Board will
consider whether it is appropriate for ADAAG to include criteria
for such acoustical performance characteristics as reverberation
time and background noise. Several non-rulemaking options will
also be considered, including additional research, the
development of advisory materials, and guidance and technical
assistance for design professionals.</p>

<p>In response to the petition, the Board wishes to focus this
request for information on the acoustical performance of
classrooms and related spaces used by children, including day
care settings for pre-primary ages. However, the Board will
consider comments and recommendations on the scope and technical
provisions of acoustical criteria appropriate for buildings and
facilities and other occupancies, as well.</p>

<p>The Board seeks relevant research, standards, data, test
reports, analyses, and recommendations from acoustical engineers
and consultants, design professionals, educators and educational
administrators and counselors, audiologists, specialists in
hearing impairments, parents of children with disabilities and
persons with hearing, speech, and language disabilities,
including learning and developmental disorders, and the
organizations that represent them. Commenters are encouraged to
address their responses to the issues outlined below.</p>

<p><em>Question 1</em>: Implementing acoustical guidelines in
educational facilities for children may be necessary for
youngsters with auditory and related disabilities to function
effectively in school. (a) Should all rooms and spaces within a
school setting be included in coverage? Some comment has
identified gymnasiums, pools, and cafeterias as particularly
problematic for students with hyperacusis, a heightened
sensitivity to noise, and for those with learning and auditory
processing disabilities. Such facilities are often highly
reverberant due to their large areas of hard, sound-reflective
surfaces. (b) Should acoustic guidelines include coverage of
these spaces? Would a less stringent standard be appropriate in
non-classroom school facilities? What acoustical properties are
appropriate in multi-purpose spaces that accommodate recreation,
performance, and food service activities at different times
during a school day? (c) In view of the importance of early
language acquisition, how should child care settings be covered?
Are there acoustical criteria in current health and safety
standards for child care facilities? (d) Should the Board
consider the development of guidelines for a wider range of
facility types for a more universal range of users? If so, what
facilities might be included?</p>

<p><em>Question 2</em>: The Board has received information on
several cases in which the acoustical environment was an issue in
an Individualized Education Plan prepared by a school system for
a child with a hearing impairment. Would a common standard for
the acoustical design of educational facilities be helpful to
design professionals seeking to provide acoustically satisfactory
environments and to school systems seeking to comply with
educational mandates for children with disabilities? Are current
design manuals, recommendations, and other technical assistance
on acoustical design sufficient?</p>

<p><em>Question 3</em>: There is considerable research that shows
that controlling classroom noise and reverberation will benefit
student learning. However, it is not clear at what levels
effective listening by children with mild, moderate, severe, or
profound hearing losses and other disabilities is compromised and
whether such conditions can be achieved in some classroom
environments, where 'self-noise' and student activity also
contribute to a poor listening environment. (a) Is there research
that identifies the specific acoustic requirements necessary for
effective listening by children with various hearing, speaking,
and learning disabilities? What acoustical performance and
testing standards are appropriate for classrooms in which
children with auditory disabilities are integrated? Are there
data that relate specific acoustical criteria to the usability of
buildings and facilities by children with learning disabilities,
developmental disabilities, and other disabilities that affect
speech reception, learning, and communication? (b) What are the
relative contributions of low reverberation values and low
background noise values to effective communication for people
with hearing loss? (c) Can the acoustical environment be improved
sufficiently through design and construction measures for
children with hearing and other impairments to receive
significant communications benefit?</p>

<p><em>Question 4</em>: The Board also seeks information on the
acoustical environment necessary for effective use of assistive
technology, including hearing aids and assistive listening
devices, by children with hearing loss. Because assistive
technologies will be part of many student accommodations, the
Board is interested in the extent to which poor acoustics
compromise the effectiveness of technologies such as sound field
enhancement (in which the amplified voice of a teacher fitted
with a microphone can be distributed to speakers placed around
the perimeter of a classroom) and direct broadcast to children
with hearing loss through personal assistive listening devices.
At what thresholds of background sound and reverberation will
children with various degrees of hearing loss be able to
participate in meaningful classroom listening if aided by
amplification technology?</p>

<p><em>Question 5</em>: The GAO report on school conditions
highlighted the multimedia classroom as the educational facility
of the future. The Board is interested in understanding the
nature and characteristics of such a classroom, particularly the
extent to which it may be interactive, with small group listening
and discussion, multiple inputs from speakers and media devices,
frequent changes in speaker-listener relationships, and other
audio source conditions that may not be fully adaptable to
amplification technologies.</p>

<p><em>Question 6</em>: The Board recognizes that decisions made by
building design professionals during the design phases of a
project affect the ultimate acoustical performance of a room or
space. Determinations of building siting, overall facility
planning, and individual room volume and proportion, floor, wall
and ceiling assembly construction and finishes, equipment
specification, and HVAC system design all contribute to the
acoustic functioning of a room or space. However, most
recommendations for acoustical performance measure the results of
such design decisions, setting limits on reverberation and
background noise. (a) Can good speech listening conditions be
achieved by setting standards for reverberation time and
background noise only? (b) Should other design variables, for
example, room configuration or proportion, ceiling height, or
size, be considered? The Swedish guidelines specify wall and
ceiling construction types and values in addition to limiting
background noise. Are these a useful model for possible
guidelines? (c) How might considerations of speech
intelligibility, speech transmission indices, and other measures
that rely on in-use testing be incorporated in acoustical design?
What are the margins of error in acoustical equipment, testing,
simulation, and construction? (d) What are effective means of
acoustically retrofitting an existing classroom or other space
that performs poorly for speech perception? How successful can
such corrective action be in correcting perceived hearing and
listening problems?</p>

<p><em>Question 7</em>: What is the square foot cost for new
classroom construction today? What additional square foot cost
would be necessary to meet average industry recommendations for
reverberation time (R 0.6 - 0.8 seconds) and background noise (NC
35-40) for classrooms? What would be the added cost, per square
foot, of achieving values within the ranges suggested by ASA (R
0.4 - 0.6 seconds; NC 25-30)? What are the relative costs of
meeting reverberation limits as opposed to background sound
limits? What data are available on the costs of alterations to
existing environments to improve acoustical conditions?</p>

<p><em>Question 8</em>: The Board also seeks information on the
non-capital costs and savings associated with constructing and
maintaining acoustically-appropriate classrooms and related
educational facilities. What are the cost implications of such
design and finishes decisions and operating procedures as room
location and configuration, window operability, and carpeting?
What savings might accrue from the elimination of some special
education environments?</p>

<p><em>Question 9</em>: How can compliance with acoustical design
criteria be assessed prior to facility occupancy and use? How can
time and physical variations in equipment manufacture,
construction, and outside noise conditions be accommodated in a
guideline? What testing and compliance practices have been used
where standards are already in place?</p>

<p><em>Question 10</em>: Many teachers and administrators have had
experience with open classrooms, in which several teaching groups
may work concurrently in a single large space, and with enclosed
classrooms of smaller size. (a) The Board is particularly
interested in comments offering a comparison of the effects on
students and teachers, in particular those with disabilities, of
classroom acoustics in such situations. (b) Do noisy classrooms
exacerbate teacher stress? Are there data available on the
effects of classroom noise on teacher health, comfort, or
performance? (c) Do schools and systems have information on
student behavior and performance after acoustical improvements,
including the partitioning of open classrooms into more discrete
units, have been made?</p>

<p><em>Question 11</em>: What approaches other than regulation
under the ADA might be successful in achieving good acoustical
design? What organizations and interests should be consulted in
the Board's consideration of acoustical issues?</p>

<h4>KEY</h4>

<p>Sound is a complex product of frequency and intensity.
Nevertheless, it is common to express sound energy as a
single-number rating measured in decibels (dB).</p>

<p>A-weighted sound levels (<strong>dBA</strong>) approximate human hearing
by suppressing the contribution of low frequency sound. Noise
limits are usually specified in dBA.</p>

<p>Noise criteria curves (<strong>NC</strong>) plot sound levels across the
frequencies between 63 and 8000 Hz (the speech perception range).
The NC curve of a room is the lowest curve that is not exceeded
by sound levels measured at each frequency. NC criteria are often
expressed as a range in specifying acceptable background noise
levels. Equivalent dBA values typically exceed NC values by 8-10
units.</p>

<p>Room criteria (<strong>RC</strong>) curves were developed for background
noise from heating, ventilating, and air conditioning systems. NC
criteria curves are adjusted at very low and very high
frequencies to avoid annoying mechanical sound.</p>

<p>The signal-to-noise ratio (<strong>SNR</strong>) is the difference
between source loudness and background sound. Child listeners
need an SNR of approximately +15 dB for good hearing conditions.</p>

<p>Noise reduction (<strong>NR</strong>) is the difference in background
sound level between a source on one side of a wall and a receiver
on the other. Transmission loss (<strong>TL</strong>) is a wall rating
(both are expressed in decibels) for noise reduction.</p>

<p>Sound transmission class (<strong>STC</strong>) is a wall or other
assembly rating for sound isolation.</p>

<h4>NOTES</h4>

<li>A consortium of organizations representing persons with
hearing, speech, and language impairments (Alexander
Graham Bell Association for the Deaf, Inc., the American
Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA),
Auditory-Verbal International, Inc., the National Center

Association, and Self Help for Hard of Hearing People
(SHHH)) organized to submit consensus recommendations on
classroom acoustics in comment to the Board's proposed
rule on access to State and local government facilities. </li>
<li>Egan classifies a Noise Criteria range of less than 20 as
necessary for excellent listening conditions, as in
concert halls, broadcast and recording studios, recital
halls, large auditoriums, and churches. An NC range
between 20-30 produces 'very good' listening conditions,
appropriate for theaters, small auditoriums, large
meeting rooms, teleconferencing facilities, executive
offices, courtrooms, chapels, and large meeting rooms. An
NC range of 25-35 is recommended for sleeping rooms. NC
30-35 will produce 'good' listening conditions for
offices, small meeting rooms, libraries, and classrooms. </li>
