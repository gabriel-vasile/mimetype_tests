		Some people, with my wife at the lead, would probably say I’m a little

		through it with a stick.</p>

		I’ve probably watched too many episodes of CSI, but inquiring minds

		Let me pull back for a second, I’m heading down the lane a little too 
		fast.&nbsp; OK, I want to start talking first about the forage quality.&nbsp; I’ve 
		discussed in the past good reasons to rotate livestock and one of those 
		reasons was to maintain good nutritional value in the forage.&nbsp; Forage 
		quality is important because it influences milk production on those 
		lactating cows that are supporting a calf, and is critical in meeting 
		the goals of average daily gain for growing animals.&nbsp; Keeping the 
		forages as vegetative as possible for as long as possible should be top 
		priority!&nbsp; In other words, don’t let it even think about going to seed.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">

		Where am I going with this?&nbsp; You can tell a lot about what is going on 
		in the pasture, especially with forage quality by taking a good look at 
		the manure.&nbsp; The dairy folk have been doing this for a long time using 
		it as a tool to help them adjust their TMR or paddocks even to the 
		extreme of running it through sieves to separate out different particle 
		sizes….anybody want that job?&nbsp; It gives us though a really good 
		evaluation of the cow and her diet and provides an idea of how well the 
		rumen is functioning.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">

		In a well working rumen, there should be enough total fiber to maintain 
		rumination.&nbsp; The mat of fiber in the rumen retains the forage for more 
		complete digestion.&nbsp; It must be in balance and we have to give some 
		credit where due and here it lies with the cow herself.&nbsp; If she has a 
		choice, she will consume a mixture that will maintain that mat.&nbsp; Have 
		you ever taken the time to watch a cow in the early spring once they 
		have been turned out into new grass?&nbsp; She will be out there grazing for 
		about 3 days and then, based on forage quality and how much dry residue 
		is left from the previous year, she is very likely to start hitting 
		every fence row looking for old mature roughage and will even eat tree 
		limbs, etc. to get it.&nbsp; If this is really what she is doing, then you 
		could go up to the side of this cow and give a push and hear a sloshing 
		sound…better from the side than from the rear…don’t stand to close 
		behind her under these conditions; consider yourself warned!&nbsp; At this 
		time of year, especially if there is little or no dry residue left from 
		the previous year mixed into the sward, the forage quality is typically 
		very high in crude protein and moisture.&nbsp; It is under these conditions 
		you can win the bet that that cow would probably even eat straw if 
		available; perhaps a good story for a “Ripley’s Believe It or Not”.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">

		I’m getting sidetracked again.&nbsp; Sorry about that.&nbsp; Rumination and 
		digestion by microbes break down forages in the rumen.&nbsp; If the cow does 
		not eat enough fiber to maintain that mat, both for rumination and rumen 
		function, the forages can pass through the rumen too quickly and be 
		under digested.&nbsp; If this is happening, milk production and average daily 
		gain can suffer.&nbsp; Back to the manure, looking at it can tell you a few 
		things.&nbsp; The softer the stool, generally the higher the quality of 
		forages they are grazing…within limits.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">

		Extremely soft or just plan “loose” manure is a good indicator of very 
		high forage quality but as mentioned above, you can get too much of a 
		good thing.&nbsp; Those really soft piles…splatters, can easily be 22-28% 
		crude protein with digestibility in the 80’s…it is really moving!&nbsp; This 
		is wonderful feed if we can just slow it down a bit.&nbsp; Grazing turnips is 
		a good example of a high moisture, high protein forage that really needs 
		some dry matter as a side dish to balance the rumen and maintain that 
		mat.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">

		True “piles” indicate then that forage quality is lower and probably 
		more like in the range of 6-8% crude protein with moderate total 
		digestible nutrients.&nbsp; This type of manure usually indicates a declining 
		forage quality and is more maintenance quality at this point.&nbsp; Look at 
		the manure of cows that were trying to survive on some of the hay and 
		stalks fed last winter, quality was certainly lacking in some cases.&nbsp; 
		They were often consuming more mature forages including the stalks, so 
		there is an increase in structural carbohydrates consumed.&nbsp; This type of 
		“feed” stay in the digestive track longer, more moisture is removed and 
		so it ends up as harder material.</p>

		<img border="0" src="GB6-205.jpg" width="300" height="225" align="right" alt="Vegetation Picture">The 
		happy range is that nice smooth textured manure…yeah, I’ve looked at way 
		too much manure.&nbsp; This manure will have a crude protein range from 
		12-20% with digestibility in the 60’s and 70’s.&nbsp; I believe it was R.L. 
		Dairymple who actually broke manure quality down into categories, four 
		or five if I remember right, which I did not keep in my mind, but I 
		think I remember the descriptive word of what he thought the ideal patty 
		should look like; pudding.&nbsp; At this stage, quality of the forages 
		consumed is well balanced and stays in the rumen long enough to allow 
		good absorption of nutrients and thus good performance.&nbsp; If it is almost 
		liquid, then some roughage, i.e. fiber is beneficial to slow down the 
		process.&nbsp; If it is hard and piling high, then the addition of protein 
		may be warranted or improved pasture management practiced.&nbsp; </p>
