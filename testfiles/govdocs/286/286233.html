      <h4>General Information</h4>
		<p>Of the factors that influence the growth and reproductive performance 
		of beef cows, proper nutrition is probably the most critical. Because 
		feed costs represent over half the total cost in a cow-calf production 
		system, it is very important to keep feed costs low while meeting your 
		animals’ nutritional needs. Vital nutrients in beef cattle diets include 
		water, energy, protein, calcium, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, trace 
		minerals, and vitamins.</p>
		<h4>Types of Diets</h4>
		<p>Depending on your circumstances, you may choose from a number of 
		feeding approaches for your herd. The traditional approach is to allow 
		the cattle unlimited access to pasture or hay. But if the forage is not 
		sufficiently high in protein and other nutrients, the cows may be 
		malnourished even though they have all they can eat. Poor quality forage 
		and crop residues have a high proportion of fiber to protein which takes 
		longer for cows to digest. Consequently, cows can eat only about one and 
		a half times their body weight per day of low-quality forage. If the 
		forage is of high quality, however, cows can consume about three percent 
		of their body weight daily. Unlimited access to feed is sometimes 
		referred to as ad lib, short for the Latin ad libitim.<br>
		<br>
		It may be necessary to supplement a low- to medium-quality forage diet 
		with high-quality hay, or with soybean meal, grain, or co-products like 
		distillers dried grains or corn gluten feed. With supplementation, cows 
		can actually digest more low-quality forage—up to two percent of their 
		body weight. Grain supplementation should be no more than 0.5 percent of 
		the cow’s body weight <b>(BW)</b>. If the forage is of such poor quality 
		that more supplementation is required, you should consider using 
		byproducts.<br>
		<br>
		The most economical way to feed beef cows is to graze the cows. 
		Brassicas and small grains with cornstalks can be used to provide fall 
		and winter grazing very economically. If the cattle need to be fed due 
		to snow cover or other factors related to your farm, you should develop 
		a low cost method of feeding the cows. Following is a brief discussion 
		of the factors influencing nutrition and some example diets. If your 
		cows are thin or heavy milking, you will need higher energy diets than 
		the examples provided. If your cows are larger than those described in 
		the example, they will need proportionally more feed.</p>
		<h4>Water</h4>
		<p>Water is often the forgotten nutrient. <b>It is important to have an 
		adequate supply of fresh, clean water available for cattle.</b> To be 
		sure your water is not contaminated with chemical run-off or biological 
		organisms, you should have it tested by one of the commercial services 
		that are widely available.</p>
		<h4>Energy and Protein</h4>
		<p>The primary nutrients of concern for beef cattle are <b>energy</b> 
		(referred to as “total digestible nutrition,” or <b>TDN</b>) and <b>
		protein</b> (also called “crude protein,” or <b>CP)</b>. The example 
		diets would need to be modified to account for these factors.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Table 1</b> presents the composition of common feeds, including their 
		dry matter (DM) factor, energy and protein provided, and the presence 
		(+, ++) or absence (-) of the macro minerals calcium, phosphorus, and 
		potassium. Actual values vary widely—it is advisable to pay for a 
		nutrient analysis of your forage. If you buy commercial feed mixes, you 
		can use the content analysis provided by the manufacturer. All values 
		are expressed on a dry-matter basis to permit comparison of feeds that 
		vary in moisture content.<br>

      <h4>General Information</h4>
		<p>A successful feeding system (pasture-based system, traditional 
		component feeding system, and Total Mixed Ration or TMR) should meet the 
		nutrient requirements of the cow, use economical feed sources available 
		in the area, and optimize profitability and income over feed costs. When 
		considering a management intensive grazing (MIG) system, dairy managers 
		must consider and manage the following factors;<br>
		<br>
		1. Optimize rumen fermentation<br>
		2. Manage dry matter intake<br>
		3. Feed sorting and selection<br>
		4. Effective use of fiber<br>
		5. Economics and positioning other feeds</p>
		<h4>Optimizing Rumen Fermentation</h4>
		<p>The challenge with a pasture-based feeding program is to maintain 
		rumen pH values from 5.8 to 6.2 that will support optimal digestibility, 
		nitrogen flow, and desirable components. If pasture quality is less than 
		35% neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and over 80 percent digestibility, 
		rumen pH can drop below 5.8. If additional fermentable carbohydrates are 
		added such as, molasses or barley, pH levels could drop below the 
		optimal level. However, some starch and by-product grains can stimulate 
		microbial growth and provide needed energy.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p><br>
			• Maintaining rumen pH from 5.8 to 6.2 will be challenge with high 
			quality legume grass forages. Lush pasture will be low in effective 
			fiber due to low level of NDF (neutral detergent fiber) and rapid 
			rate of passage. New Zealand workers reported that cows consuming 
			only clover and grass pasture (no concentrate) experienced rumen pH 
			under 5.5 with no supplemental grain. Adding 2 to 5 pounds of long 
			forage particles (over one inch in length) can form and maintain a 
			rumen or hay raft in the rumen.<br>
			<br>
			• Limit the amount of a concentrate mixture to 5 to 6 pounds per 
			meal to avoid “slug feeding” of starch leading to lower rumen pH and 
			lactic acid formation. Providing 2 to 5 pounds of long forage prior 
			to the grain and pasture consumption can increase rumen pH. <br>
			<br>
			• Balance the rate of available nitrogen (protein) and carbohydrate 
			degradation in the rumen by feeding grain and/or corn silage before 
			lush pasture is consumed. The challenge is pasture that is low in 
			rumen fermentable carbohydrate while containing excessive degradable 
			and total protein. Feeding starch or digestible NDF (by-product feed 
			such as corn gluten feed or soy hulls) before milking allows cows to 
			return directly to the pasture after milking. <br>
			<br>
			• Provide adequate effective fiber by maintaining a minimum of 5 
			pounds of forage particles that are over one inch or longer in 
			length. Feeding 1 to 2 pounds of straw (one pound of straw functions 
			similarly to 2 to 3 pounds of long hay), 5 pounds of baled hay, or 
			10 pounds of silage dry matter containing 40 to 60 percent on the 
			top two boxes of the Penn State Particle Separator unit. These 
			adjustments should adjust fiber levels.<br>
			<br>
			• Manage rumen turnover by slowing down rapidly fermentable pasture 
			fiber by adding some long forage to the diet. Processing grains can 
			change the rate and site of starch fermentation while by-product 
			feeds (such as wheat midds, soy hulls, or corn gluten feed) can 
			dilute starch levels in grain mixtures.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<h4><br>
		Managing Dry Matter Intake</h4>
		<p><br>
		Optimizing dry matter intake is another key factor in successful 
		pasture-based feeding systems and programs. Energy is the first limit 
		nutrient for milk yield, milk components, and reproduction in high 
		producing cows. Dry matter intake (energy) can be limiting to 50 pounds 
		of 4% fat corrected milk. New Zealand researchers report cows can 
		consume about four pounds of pasture dry matter per hour of aggressive 
		or active grazing. Six to eight hours are the normal daily grazing 
		times. If higher levels of milk production are desired, additional dry 
		matter will be needed. Dairy managers have three choices: additional 
		forage (such as corn silage), more grain, and/or a partial TMR. To 
		enhance pasture dry matter intake, pasture can be cut and allowed to 
		partially wilt, allowing for great dry matter consumption. Grazing 
		activity (distance walked and slope) will require more energy (can 
		represent 4 to 5 pounds of milk energy used for walking). <br>
		<br>
		Methods to achieve higher dry matter intake (if this is economical and 
		is your goal) will require supplemental feeds that complement pasture 
		nutrients and do not substitute for low-priced pasture nutrient sources.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>• Cows under 50 pounds of 4% fat corrected milk may support this 
			milk yield with high quality pasture only. <br>
			<br>
			• Cows producing over 50 pounds of 4% fat corrected milk will 
			require more energy, usually gained from concentrate and silage 
			sources (energy is limiting).<br>
			<br>
			• Cows producing over 70 pounds of 4% fat corrected milk will need 
			more energy, added rumen undegraded protein (such as heat treated 
			soy meal), and supplemental fat (energy and amino acids are limiting 
			at this level of production).</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Adding a buffer (such as sodium bicarbonate) can increase dry matter 
		intake by stabilizing rumen pH (adding 0.3 to 0.5 pounds per cow per day 
		to the grain mixture or partial TMR). Buffers can reduce concentrate 
		intake at higher levels. To improve pasture intake, offering cows a 
		fresh allocation (new paddock or moving an electric wire) every 12 to 24 
		hours is a recommended procedure. <br>
		<br>
		One approach to estimate pasture intake is to calculate the amount of 
		pasture dry matter based on NDF intake. Wisconsin workers report dairy 
		cows will consume 1.2 percent of the cow’s body weight as total NDF. 
		Using this guideline with high quality pasture (40% NDF), a 1000 pound 
		Jersey cow could eat 12 pounds of total NDF or 30 pounds of pasture dry 
		matter (12 pounds divided by 0.40 which is 40% NDF in pasture expressed 
		as a decimal). As forage NDF increases (pasture quality drops), pasture 
		dry matter also declines reduces energy intake.</p>
		<h4><br>
		Feed Sorting and Selection</h4>
		<p>Pasture provides another challenge as cows can selectively graze 
		legumes and/or grasses available and different plant parts (leaves or 
		stems) leading to undesirable rumen pH and fermentation characteristics. 
		If supplemental feeds are offered, control intake to maintain uniform 
		consumption with adequate bunk space for feed access or along a hot wire 
		in the pasture. One example would be to offer supplemental feed (corn 
		silage, urea, minerals, molasses, and ear corn) prior to milking with 
		adequate bunks which allows all cows to eat similar amounts of this 
		partial TMR (PMR) before they milk.<br>
		<br>
		For dairy cows, pastures should be clipped after each rotation to 
		control weeds and unpalatable pasture (stems and plants going to seed). 
		Some dairy managers will follow the lactating cows with dry cows or 
		heifers to consume the lower quality pasture dry matter.</p>
		<h4>Effective Fiber</h4>
		<p>Based on New Zealand and Ireland data, the effective pasture NDF 
		ranges from 35 to 40 percent. Chemical NDF pasture levels can be low at 
		35% NDF (U.S. forages range from 40 to 55%). New Zealand worker 
		recommend a minimum of 15 to 17% effective NDF based on pasture (38% 
		grass NDF times 40% effective NDF). If lush pasture contains lower NDF 
		values (new pasture, clovers, or selective grazing), rumen pH and feed 
		digestibility can be less than optimal. If fermentable carbohydrates are 
		fed with these pasture qualities (such as corn or barley grain), 
		effective NDF levels need to be raised to 18 to 20% from hay, by-product 
		feeds, and/or straw. Estimating effective NDF is difficult and labs do 
		not routinely offer tests. The Penn State Forage Separator Box is used 
		to estimate effective particle length for silages and Total Mixed 
		Rations (TMR) (percent of feed particles in the top two boxes). If 
		effective NDF is marginal, dairy managers may observe the following 
		characteristics.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>• Low milk components, especially milk fat (drop of 0.3 to 0.5 
			percentage points)<br>
			• Loose manure or low fecal scores (less than 3 on a 1 to 5 range)<br>
			• Lameness and abnormal hoof growth patterns<br>
			• Free choice consumption of sodium bicarbonate<br>
			• Licking or eating of dirt <br>
			• Lack of cud chewing</p>
		</blockquote>
		<h4>Economics of Pasture-Based Feeding Systems</h4>
		<p>The profitability of pasture-based intensive pasture based systems is 
		one factor that appeals to dairy managers. Table 1 lists university 
		field studies comparing grazing and non-grazing farms.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Table 1. </b>Profitability of grazing expressed as dollars of net 
		farm income ($NFI) per cow and comparative dollar advantage of the

		<p>New York workers monitored 58 grazing herds (85 cows per herd) and 
		105 non-grazing herds (83 cows per herds) from 1996 to 2001. The 
		following differences were reported:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>• 1,008 pounds less milk per cow for the grazing herds<br>
			• Net farm income per cow was $71 higher for the grazing herds<br>
			• Veterinary and medicine costs were $13 less per cow for the 
			grazing herds<br>
			• Machinery costs were $62 per cow lower for the grazing herds<br>
			• Investment per cow was $937 less per cow for the grazing herd.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>These studies indicate that pasture-based systems can be economically 
		competitive, but milk production declines must be minimized, milk cow 
		nutrient needs must be met, and managers must avoid large investments in 
		facilities and equipment. Dairy managers also report less hoof and leg 
		problems, lower culling rates, and extra replacement heifers that can be 
		sold. Dairy managers have three nutrient approaches with a pasture-based 
		systems.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>• Approach 1. Supplement 2 to 4 pounds of grain (New Zealand 
			system) or 10 percent of the total ration dry matter. Potential milk 
			yield could be 30 to 50 pounds of milk per cow per day or 12,000 to 
			15,000 pounds of milk per cow annually.<br>
			<br>
			• Approach 2. Supplement 2 to 5 pounds of forage dry matter (corn 
			silage or hay) and feed one pound of grain for each 5 pounds or 30 
			percent of ration dry matter. Potential milk yield could be 40 to 60 
			pounds of milk per cow per day or 15,000 to 17,000 pounds of milk 
			per cow annually.<br>
			<br>
			• Approach 3. Supplement 50 percent of the dry matter from PMR and 
			50 percent of the dry matter from pasture. Potential milk yield 
			could be 60 to 80 pounds of milk per cow per day or 17,000 to 20,000 
			pound of milk per cow annually.</p>

      <h4>General Information</h4>
    <p><font face="Verdana"><strong><em>Relative Forage Quality (RFQ</em></strong></font><em>)</em> is a new index to rank the quality of 
	forages. Such an index is helpful in ranking forages for sale or 
	inventorying forages to animal groups to meet certain quality needs in the 
	ration. <br>
	<br>
	This fact sheet is a follow-up to an earlier one (November 2000) titled 
	Forage Quality.<br>
	<br>
	<em><strong><font face="Verdana">Relative Feed Value (RFV)</font></strong></em> has been of great value for years as a quality 
	index for ranking cool-season grasses and legumes based on combining 
	digestibility and intake potential. These values have been calculated from 
	acid detergent fiber (ADF) and neutral detergent fiber (NDF). <br>
	<br>
	With introduction in 2001 of new approaches to determine animal requirements 
	in the National Research Council Nutrient Requirements for Dairy Cattle, 
	there was an opportunity to improve RFV through use of newer analyses and 
	equations. <br>
	<br>
	Thus the concept of Relative Forage Quality (RFQ) was introduced as a method 
	to better predict animal performance from the analysis of forages.</p>
    <h4>Differences Between RFV and RFQ</h4>

    <P>RFV is based on the concept of digestible dry matter intake relative to a 
	standard forage according to the following formula:<br>
	<br>
	RFV = (DMI, as % of BW) x (DDM, as % of DM) ÷ 1.29<br>
	<br>
	Where: DMI = Dry matter intake<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DDM = 
	Digestible dry matter<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BW = Body 
	weight<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DM = Dry 
	matter<br>
	<br>
	Dry matter intake was estimated from neutral detergent fiber and digestible 
	dry matter estimated from acid detergent fiber. The constant, 1.29, was 
	chosen so that RFV = 100 for full bloom alfalfa hay. The constant was the 
	expected DDM intake, as % of BW, for full-bloom alfalfa based on animal 
	data.<br>
	<br>
	RFQ uses the same concept and format except that TDN (total digestible 
	nutrients) is used rather than DDM. In other words, RFQ has a digestible 
	fiber component and is calculated as follows:<br>
	<br>
	RFQ = (DMI, as % of BW) x (TDN, as % of DM) ÷ 1.23<br>
	<br>
	RFQ adjusts intake for digestible fiber. Research has shown that intake is 
	affected by digestibility of the fiber.<br>
	<br>
	RFQ appears to give a much better quality estimate for grasses and 
	legume-grass mixtures.<br>
	<br>
	RFQ can be used for all forages, including warm-season grasses and brassicas 
	(turnips, kale, rape, etc.). However, RFQ should not be used for corn silage 
	because so much of the energy differences in corn silage relate to starch 
	availability, which is not considered in RFQ.</P>

    <h4>Relationship Between RFV and RFQ</h4>
    <font FACE="ZapfHumnst BT" SIZE="2"><b>
	<p>Analysis from numerous forage samples shows a strong correlation between 
	RFV and RFQ. <br>
	<br>
	The intent with RFQ was to have the same mean and range in forage analysis 
	as RFV. Therefore, RFQ could be substituted for RFV without making economic 
	and other management changes. It appears that RFQ can be substituted for RFV 
	and they will be similar in about 60% of the samples.<br>
	<br>
	In some individual forage samples, RFV and RFQ varied by over 20 points. 
	When differences like these do occur, it is believed that RFQ will be a 
	better estimate of animal performance than RFV. Also, RFQ more accurately 
	discounts heat damaged hay or haylage.<br>
	<br>
	In instances where RFQ was higher than RFV, the hay seller could have 
	received more money for the hay (or the buyer could have simply received a 
	good deal) and where RFQ was lower than RFV, dairy cows would not have 
	milked as expected.</p>
	</b></font>
    <h4>
    Summary</h4>
    <p>Due to the digestible fiber component, RFQ seems to predict animal 
	performance better than RFV. It appears that RFQ and RFV average about the 
	same, so RFQ can be substituted for RFV in pricing, contracts, and other 
	uses. Note: Table 4 shows there is a large variation in cost per day for the 
	diets—they range from 59 cents to $2.14 per day. If the cows were fed for 
	120 days, the high-cost diet for the dry cow would be $186 more (per cow) 
	than the low-cost diet. That difference could certainly “make or break” your 
	profit situation!</p>
