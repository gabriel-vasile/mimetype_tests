However, inefficient utilization of dietary N by dairy cows requires that large amounts of protein be fed to dairy cows, increasing farm costs, reducing profits for farmers, and increasing N pollution of the environment.

Utilization of protein in legume silages, major feeds for dairy cows in North America, is especially poor because of their large amounts of NPN.  Dairy farmers have countered this low efficiency by feeding more protein because the value of the extra milk produced was greater than the cost of the extra protein.  However, N pollution has now become a major problem in agriculture.  The overall objective of this project is to improve protein efficiency and reduce N losses to the environment in dairy farming.<br>						</font><br>						<br>					</blockquote>				</td>				<td><font color="#b9bfb2">..</font></td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td width="613">					<div align="center">						<font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><a href="index.html">CRIS Project Home</a> | <a href="http://dfrc.wisc.edu">DFRC Home</a></font></div>				</td>				<td></td>			</tr>		</table>		<map name="topLogob92d1294"><area shape="rect" coords="402,0,474,19" href="http://cristel.nal.usda.gov/"><area shape="rect" coords="386,20,460,34" href="http://dfrc.wisc.edu/contact.html"><area shape="rect" coords="375,36,448,51" href="http://dfrc.wisc.edu"><area shape="rect" coords="0,12,342,81" href="index.html"></map><map name="topLogob92d39b1"><area shape="rect" coords="405,4,481,20" href="about.html"><area shape="rect" coords="386,22,467,36" href="crisAtDfrc.html"><area shape="rect" coords="375,37,450,53" href="http://dfrc.wisc.edu/"><area shape="rect" coords="4,14,350,80" href="index.html"></map>		<p></p>	</body></html>
