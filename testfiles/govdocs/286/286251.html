  <blockquote> Dear Colleagues, 
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may recall the extensive information 
      on the Bass and Paur (1985) ozone absorption coefficients presented at both 
      the Halkidiki and Gottingen Ozone Symposia, and that the Commission had 
      charged Dr. Bob Hudson, in collaboration with Dr. Carl Mateer, to study 
      and make recommendations on their application in the WMO Global Ozone Observing 
      System (GO<sub><font SIZE="-1">3</font></sub>OS), 
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to inform you that, after 
      very elaborate studies carried out by Dr. Hudson who also assessed the other 
      recent measurements of ozone absorption coefficients, a set for use in the 
      standard Dobson wavelengths was recommended. Further calculations carried 
      out by Drs. Mateer and Komhyr were necessary and consultations with other 
      colleagues resulted in the Guidance attached to this letter. 
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the main recommendation to start 
      calculating and reporting to the WMO-WO<sub><font SIZE="-1">3</font></sub>DC 
      total ozone amount using the new (Bass and Paur) ozone absorption coefficients 
      from 1 January 1992 was also endorsed by the WMO Executive Council Panel 
      on Environmental Pollution and Atmospheric Chemistry, this recommendation 
      is being communicated formally by the Secretary-General of WMO, Professor 
      G.O.P. Obasi, to the Permanent Representatives of the countries having total 
      ozone measurements for implementation. 
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present letter and attached Guidance 
      are forwarded to you in order to keep you informed and to facilitate timely 
      transition to the new 1992 scale. 
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to convey the 
      appreciation of both the Commission and WMO to our colleagues, Drs Hudson, 
      Mateer and Komhyr for their dedicated efforts towards successful 'completion 
      of this important task. 
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With best wishes for the New Year.

      GUIDANCE FOR USE OF NEW OZONE ABSORPTION COEFFICIENTS IN<br>
      PROCESSING DOBSON AND BREWER SPECTROPHOTOMETER TOTAL OZONE DATA BEGINNING<br>
      1 JANUARY 1992* 
    </center>
  <p> 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Background</u> 
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early observations with Dobson spectrophotometers, 
    first employing photocells and later photomultipliers, were processed using 
    ozone absorption coefficients based on the laboratory data of Ny and Choong 
    (1933). At the beginning of the International Geophysical Year (1 July, 1957), 
    new absorption coefficients were adopted for use (Dobson, 1957), this time 
    employing the laboratory values of Vigroux (1953). Pre-IGY Dobson spectrophotometer 
    ozone values were converted to the Vigroux scale by multiplying them by 1.36. 
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the Vigroux coefficients gave 
    inconsistent ozone values from observations on different combinations of wavelengths 
    (e.g. CD-wavelength observations yielded ozone values nearly 10% smaller than 
    did AD-wavelength observations), the Vigroux AD-wavelength ozone absorption 
    coefficients were adopted as standard. Based on a redetermination of the ozone 
    absorption coefficients by Vigroux (1967) and an examination of the coefficients 
    by G.M.B. Dobson in light of atmospheric observations made in Canada, the 
    United Kingdom and elsewhere, a modified set of Vigroux ozone absorption coefficients 
    was derived which gave highly consistent ozone amounts from observations made 
    on different wavelengths. These modified coefficients, which preserved the 
    original Vigroux AD-wavelength coefficient as standard were recommended by 
    the International Association of Meteorology and Atmospheric Physics (IAMAP) 
    for use in the WMO Global Ozone Observing System (GO<sub><font SIZE="-1">3</font></sub>OS) 
    beginning 1 January 1968. Rayleigh molecular scattering coefficients used 
    with the ozone absorption coefficients in processing ozone data were derived 
    from the Rayleigh Cabannes formula (Dobson 1957). 
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the mid 1980's, several research 
    groups redetermined ozone absorption coefficients in the Hartley and Huggins 
    bands. In 1988, the International Ozone Commission assigned an action item 
    to R.D. Hudson and C.L. Mateer to derive and recommend for use improved Dobson 
    instrument ozone absorption coefficients based on the new laboratory data 
    and to set a date for their use. 
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hudson (1990) recommended use of the 
    Bass-Paur (1985) ozone absorption coefficients, adjusted to account for the 
    temperature dependence (as determined by Barnes and Mauersberger 1987) of 
    the Hearn (1961) 253.7 nm wavelength ozone absorption coefficient. Subsequently, 
    Mateer (1990) used a &quot;dynamic&quot; approach to compute effective ozone 
    absorption coefficients for the Dobson instruments. The method not only weighs 
    the Bass-Paur coefficients with the instrument slit function weights, at an 
    ozone-weighted mean temperature determined from convolution of appropriate 
    temperature and ozone profiles but also takes into account solar flux weighting 
    at the instrument slits. Subsidiary data used by Mateer in obtaining results 
    were the slit function data for world standard Dobson spectrophotometer 83 
    determined experimentally by Komhyr (1982); the extra-terrestrial solar spectrum 
    compiled by Furukawa et al. (1966); the Rayleigh scattering cross-sections 
    calculated by Bates (1984); the atmospheric temperature profiles in the <u>US 
    Standard Atmosphere, 1962</u> and the <u>US Standard Atmosphere supplements, 
    1966</u>: the standard ozone profiles compiled by Mateer, DeLuisi and Porco 
    (1980); and the standard ozone profiles compiled by Bhartia et al. (1984) 
    for use in re-evaluation of NIMBUS 7 SBUV ozone profile data. 
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dobson instrument ozone absorption 
    coefficients tentatively recommended for use by Mateer (1990) were examined 
    by Komhyr early in 1990 for consistency in ozone amounts derived from quasi-simultaneous 
    observations on different wavelengths. Observational data used were those 
    obtained with Dobson Instrument 83 at Mauna Loa Observatory during summertimes 
    since 1975 (Komhyr et al. 1989). Using the new coefficients, only small differences 
    were observed in ozone amounts derived from observations made on different 
    wavelengths compared with ozone amounts derived from observations on AD-wavelengths. 
    The range of differences in ozone values derived from observations on A, BD, 
    B, CD, D wavelengths was only 3.8%. Komhyr noted that the range of differences 
    could be reduced to 0.9% if the coefficients recommended for use by Mateer, 
    1990 for B and D wavelengths were increased by 1.3% and 2.0% respectively. 
    This modification of the B and D coefficients was agreed upon after consultations 
    with Hudson, Mateer and Bojkov and a decision was made to recommend use of 
    the new coefficients in processing Dobson and Brewer instrument ozone data 
    beginning 1 January 1992. This was also endorsed by the WMO Executive Council 
    Panel of Experts/CAS Working Group on Environmental Pollution and Atmospheric 
    Chemistry for implementation in the WMO Global Ozone Observing System (GO<sub><font SIZE="-1">3</font></sub>OS).

    behalf of the ozone Commission of IAMAP 
  <p> 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>New Dobson Instrument Ozone Absorption Coefficients</u> 
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effective ozone absorption coefficients 
    listed in Table 1 are the Bass-Paur coefficients adjusted to account for the 
    temperature dependence of the Hearn (1961) 253.7 nm wavelength ozone absorption 
    coefficient and adapted for use with Dobson instruments by Mateer (1990) but 
    with the Mateer B and D wavelength coefficients increased by 1.3% and 2.0% 
    respectively in order to achieve agreement in ozone values to within about 
    1% from observations made on different wavelengths. Table 1 also lists the 
    slit weighted average Rayleigh molecular scattering coefficients derived from 
    the data of Bates (1984). The Bates coefficients are generally considered 
    to be the best currently available.

    RECOMMENDATIONS 
  </center>
  <p> (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effective ozone absorption coefficients 
    listed in Table 1 should be adopted as standard for total ozone measurements 
    with Dobson ozone spectrophotometers; 
  <p> (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rayleigh scattering coefficients 
    listed in Table 1 should be adopted as standard for total ozone measurements 
    with Dobson spectrophotometers; 
  <p> (c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The standard effective ozone absorption 
    coefficients apply to the US Standard Atmosphere 1962 and the Bhartia et al. 
    standard ozone profile for 45°N and 325 DU total ozone. The values mu=2 and 
    ozone weighted mean temperature -46.3°C are also inherent in these coefficients; 
  <p> (d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zenith Blue and Zenith Cloud total 
    ozone observations should be evaluated using existing empirical cloud charts 
    that were devised to yield total ozone amounts which agreed with ozone values 
    determined quasi-simultaneously from direct sun. AD-wavelength observations 
    [with Vigroux (1953) absorption coefficient 1.388]. Convert to the new scale 
    by multiplying all values by 0.9143; 
  <p> (e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These recommendations should be put 
    into effect 1 January 1992. 
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provisional ozone data obtained using 
    the new absorption and scattering coefficients should continue to be sent 
    routinely to the WMO world Ozone Data Center in Canada for archiving. Each 
    station submitting their data should include in the line for comments a message 
    &quot;processed with 1992 absorption coefficients&quot;. These standardized 
    data sets could be subject to additional improvements in special studies, 
    e.g through application of seasonal mean temperature profile corrections, 
    or corrections related to values of mu*X. 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Converting Past 
    Data</u> 
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To adjust total ozone data obtained during 
    1 July 1957 - 31 December 1991 on the Vigroux (1953, 1967) AD-wavelength ozone 
    absorption coefficient scale (with ozone absorption coefficient 1.388 to the 
    1992 absorption coefficients: 
  <p> 
    <center>
      MULTIPLY ALL OZONE VALUES BY 0.9743
    </center>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Errors in the converted data will be 
    less than 0.3% for 220<x><550 D.U., 1<mu><3 and 680<station pressure><1013 
    mbar. Note that because of the use of improved Rayleigh scattering coefficients, 
    the correction factor of 0.9743 is slightly larger than the factor 1.388/1.432="0.9693" 
    derived from the ratio of the old and new AD- wavelength ozone absorption 
    coefficients. 
  <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since July 1957, a few stations have 
    published total ozone data from C- and CD-wavelength direct sun observations 
    using the Vigroux (1953) ozone absorption coefficients scale, utilizing absorption 
    coefficient values of 0.865 cm-1 and 0.491 cm-1 respectively. To convert such 
    data to the new 1992 scale (based on the modified Bass-Paur (1985): 
  <p> 
    <center>
      MULTIPLY C-DSGQP OZONE VALUES by 1.0410<br>
      MULTIPLY CD-DSGQP OZONE VALUES by 1.0754 
    </center>
  <p> 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Instructions for Brewer</u> 
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total ozone measurements made with the 
    Brewer spectrophotometer have been reported to the WMO World Ozone Data Center 
    (WO<sub><font SIZE="-1">3</font></sub>DC) in Toronto using absorption coefficients 
    adjusted to make the Brewer instrument measurements directly comparable with 
    those made by the Dobson instrument. The Dobson measurements are based on 
    the Vigroux scale of absorption coefficients adopted by WMO, IAMAP since 1 
    January 1968. Effective 1 January 1992, the total ozone measurements made 
    with the Dobson instrument are to be reported to the WO<sub><font SIZE="-1">3</font></sub>DC 
    based on the ozone absorption coefficient measurements made by Bass and Paur 
    (1985) as explained above. 
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In coordination with the conversion of 
    absorption coefficient scale for the Dobson instrument, the total ozone measurements 
    made the Brewer instrument are also to be reported to the WO<sub><font SIZE="-1">3</font></sub>DC 
    on the Bass-Paur (BP) scale effective 1 January 1992. 
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reporting Brewer ozone data on the BP 
    absorption coefficient scale is achieved by multiplying the daily average 
    total ozone values by <u>0.973</u>. 
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>For direct sun measurements this can be done by dividing the absorption 
      coefficients (both for ozone and SO<sub><font SIZE="-1">2</font></sub>) 
      by 0.973 and entering them into the instrument constant files. 
      <p> For zenith sky measurements the daily summarized value is multiplied 
        by 0.973. 
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For data submission to the WO<sub><font SIZE="-1">3</font></sub>DC 
    the fact that the ozone measurements are on the BP scale should be confirmed 
    by including the statement &quot;BP SCALE&quot; on line five of the monthly 
    data submission record.
