<p><font size="3">During the snow season, which lasts up to 9 months in the
Arctic Refuge, muskoxen remain in small areas, restricted by the availability of
forage and by strategies needed to conserve energy (Reynolds 1998<i>b</i>).
Human disturbance or destruction of their habitat could displace muskoxen from
these limited wintering areas.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">To determine what kinds of sites are used by muskoxen in
late-winter and why these sites are selected, we set the following research
objectives: 1) determine selection of vegetation types based on use and
availability, and 2) compare snow depth and hardness, vegetation biomass, and
environmental variables at feeding and non-feeding sites. Our study sites were
located in the eastern half of the Arctic Refuge coastal plain and 1002 Area,
between the Jago River and the Kongakut River.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Fieldwork was conducted in March, April, and July 1989-1990 at
44 late-winter foraging sites used by muskoxen. These sites included <i>feeding
zones</i> (with feeding microsites or craters), <i>non-used</i> <i>adjacent
zones</i> (contiguous to the feeding zone), and <i>non-used nonadjacent zones</i>
(100 m beyond the adjacent zone). At each foraging site, a randomly-oriented
transect was laid across the site, passing through the center of the feeding
zone and defining unused zones.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Foraging sites were located from observations and tracks of
muskox groups in March and April. Fecal pellets were collected for diet
selection analysis. Winter foraging sites were relocated the following July when
vegetation and environmental characteristics along transects were measured
(Wilson 1992). Snow conditions, environmental characteristics, forage cover, and
non-vegetated cover were included in an analysis of variables related to habitat
selection.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">In late winter, muskoxen fed most commonly in moist sedge
tundra (37%) and tussock sedge tundra (37%) and used these types in proportion
to availability. Dryas terrace (9%), riparian grass forb gravel bars (7%), wet
sedge (5%), partially vegetated tundra (2%), and shrub tundra (2%) were selected
less frequently than their availability. Muskoxen were not observed feeding in
riparian shrub, Dryas ridge, barren ground, or water (Wilson 1992).</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Total vegetation cover was greater in feeding zones than in
unused adjacent and non-adjacent zones. Cover of evergreen shrubs, sedges, and
dead vegetation was greater in feeding zones. Non-vegetative cover was greater
in adjacent and nonadjacent zones (Wilson 1992).</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Diet selection based on fecal analysis of winter pellets
(corrected for digestibility) indicated a high use of sedges (39.1%) and mosses
(24.6%) (Wilson 1992). Sedges and grasses were <i>selected</i> (use &gt;
availability); and horsetails, lichens, willows, and other shrubs were <i>avoided</i>
(use &lt; availability). Although selection for grasses was high, grasses did
not make up a large proportion of the diet or the available habitat.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Analysis of rumen samples indicated that sedges (31%), grasses
(19%), mosses (15%), and forbs (13%) comprised most of the diet. The proportion
of willows was 8% in rumen samples. In other studies, riparian willows were used
by muskoxen in late winter (O’Brien 1998, Robus 1991). During our study,
however, snow limited the use of most riparian shrub communities. Willows were
browsed in areas where they protruded through the snow (Wilson 1992).</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Snow depth was shallower and softer in feeding zones than in
nonadjacent zones, and shallower in feeding zones than in adjacent zones (Fig.
7.7). Snow depth and hardness were less in microsites than in unused portions of
feeding sites. Snow depth was the single variable most influential in
discriminating between used and non-used areas. Muskoxen also appeared to avoid
walking through areas of soft deep snow. Most feeding zones were near some type
of topographic relief that had been subjected to wind scarring. Snow depth was
shallower in feeding zones of tussock sedge tundra and moist sedge tundra,
suggesting that within vegetation types, muskoxen chose feeding zones based on
snow depth alone. No differences were detected between feeding zones and
adjacent and nonadjacent zones in wetness, slope, micro-relief, or aspect
(Wilson 1992).</font></p>

and <i>nonadjacent zones</i> (unused areas 100 meters beyond adjacent zones) in
late winter 1989 (<i>n</i> = 20) and 1990 (<i>n</i> = 24) on the coastal plain
of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, Alaska, USA. (<i>from</i> Wilson 1992)</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Snow depth in feeding zones was deeper in 1989 than in 1990
(34.5 cm versus 23.0 cm, respectively), and total vegetation cover was greater
in 1990 than in 1989 (Wilson 1992). In 1990, forb cover was greater in feeding
zones compared with a greater cover of sedges and non-vegetative material in
1989 feeding zones. Muskoxen did not select for areas of high total vegetative
cover in 1989, indicating that detection of vegetation characteristics may
require shallow snow cover. In 1989, mean crater depths (29.7 cm) and mean
feeding zone depths (34.5 cm) approached or exceeded the maximum snow depths in
feeding areas (&gt;30 cm) observed in other muskox studies (Rapota 1984, Smith
1984).</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Partially vegetated tundra and Dryas terraces had the
shallowest snow; the deepest snow occurred in shrub tundra and moist sedge
tundra. Gravel bars with riparian forbs and grass had the greatest total cover
of vegetation; moist sedge tundra had the least. Muskoxen selected feeding zones
with shallower snow and greater vegetation cover compared with what was
available (Wilson 1992).</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Winter habitat for muskoxen is limited in quantity because
animals must select foraging areas with shallow soft snow and a high cover of
vegetation. Areas with little vegetation or deep hard-packed snow were not used.
In this study, feeding zones were primarily along narrow bands of windblown
vegetated bluffs adjacent to creeks, rivers, and the coastline, reflecting the
importance of terrain features to habitat selection (Nellemann and Reynolds
1997).</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Snow depth was one of the most important variables
distinguishing used and unused area in this study of muskox habitat (Wilson
1992). Snow depth influences the availability of forage and can limit
accessibility to some forage types (Evans et al. 1989). Snow depth affects
energy budgets. Digging through snow to find forage is energetically costly for
ungulates (Fancy 1986). The time lost while digging craters also reduces the
daily rate of forage intake (Fleischman 1988).</font></p>
<p><font size="3">In high snow years, when some habitats are not available and
muskoxen spend more energy moving and foraging, muskoxen may be energetically
constrained, resulting in lower survival and less successful reproduction. As
winter progresses and snow accumulates, or if deep snow falls early in the
winter, muskoxen may be forced to select foraging areas with deep snow or low
plant biomass.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">If muskoxen are limited in their accumulation of body reserves
during summer, effects of a severe winter or overuse of winter range will have
greater impacts on reproductive success and survival. If, in addition, animals
are disturbed by human activities and cannot optimally use available habitats,
the effects of a severe winter likely will be magnified.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Activities associated with the extraction of petroleum
resources on the coastal plain of the Arctic Refuge have the potential to
displace muskoxen into areas of deeper snow where forage availability is low and
energetic costs to procure food are high. Displacement from, or permanent loss
of, limited winter habitat could affect reproductive success and survival of
muskoxen on the coastal plain of the Arctic Refuge.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">To minimize potential effects of petroleum exploration and
development on muskoxen in the Arctic Refuge, areas occupied by muskoxen in
winter should be avoided; and areas of potential winter habitat should not be
selected as sites for permanent facilities.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Arial" size="3"><a name="Summary">Summary</a></font></p>
</b>
<p><font size="3">Muskoxen are year-round residents of the 1002 Area on the
coastal plain of Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Numbers of muskoxen in the
Refuge have declined over time with &lt;300 currently living on the coastal
plain including &lt;250 in the 1002 Area. Calf production has also declined over
time.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Severe winters (deep snow and prolong snow seasons) and
increasing rates of predation are important factors in the dynamics of this
population. Muskoxen have expanded their range east and west of the Arctic
Refuge coastal plain and emigration has contributed to declining numbers.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Most calves are born in April and May, several weeks before
green forage is available. To survive the long months of winter and to maintain
body reserves needed for successful reproduction, muskoxen conserve energy in
winter by reducing activity and movements. In winter, muskoxen feed on dried
sedges and other low quality forage in areas of low snow. Windblown ridges
adjacent to rivers are frequently used in winter. During the short weeks of
summer, when green forage is available, muskoxen increase their movements and
activity and feed on a variety of high quality forage to regain body weight
before the next winter. River corridors and nearby uplands are often used by
muskoxen in summer.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Muskoxen in the Arctic Refuge are vulnerable to disturbance
from activities associated with petroleum exploration and extraction because of
their year-round residency, their small population numbers and their need to
conserve energy for the 9 months of winter if they are to successfully
reproduce.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Disturbances that displace muskoxen from preferred winter
habitats into areas of deeper snow or that increase their activity and movements
could significantly increase their energetic costs in winter. Female muskoxen
that are required to expend greater energy to survive the winter will have fewer
reserves for pregnancy and lactation and may not reproduce successfully.
Muskoxen frequently use habitats along or adjacent to rivers. These locations
may be sites for gravel and water extraction and winter road construction if
petroleum development is permitted in the Arctic Refuge.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Avoidance by industry of areas used by muskoxen and the
location of permanent facilities away from river corridors, flood plains, and
adjacent uplands could reduce the probability of disturbance and displacement of
muskoxen. Status and distribution of muskoxen in and near the 1002 Area should
be monitored to document future trends.</font></p>
