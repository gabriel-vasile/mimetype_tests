 27 CFR Part 5</p>
			   <p> Proprietors  of Distilled Spirits Plants, 
   Importers  and Wholesalers of Distilled 
   Spirits,  and others concerned:</p>
			   <p> Industry  Circular No. 67-3, dated April 21, 1967, advised you of a series 
   of three  public hearings to be held to consider amendments in the regulations 
   covering the  labeling and advertising of distilled spirits.</p>
			   <p> The  first hearing concerning industry petitions for regulatory changes 
   in the  labeling of neutral spirits and domestic whiskies, particularly as 
   affected by  cooperage, was concluded last September 22.  This circular is 
   issued to  provide you with a reprint of the proposed rule making for the 
   second  hearing, to begin on April 1, 1968, which was published in the Federal 
   Register for  January 26, 1968.</p>
			   <p> -</p>
			   <p> (27 CFR Part  5)
   
    LABELING AND ADVERTISING OF 
   DISTILLED SPIRITS</p>
			   <p>  NOTICE OF HEARING FOR MISCELLANEOUS 
   CHANGES IN  REGULATIONS</p>
			   <p> Notice  is hereby given, pursuant to the provisions of section 5 of the 
   Federal Alcohol Administration Act (49  Stat. 981 as amended; 27 U.S.C. 205), 
   of a public  hearing to begin at 9:30 A. M. (EST)</p>
			   <p> On  Monday, April 1, 1968, in Room 3313, Internal 
   Revenue Service Building,  1111 Constitution Avenue, 
    N.W., Washington, D. C.</p>
			   <p> at which  time and place all interested parties will be afforded opportunity 
   to be heard,  in person or by authorized representative, concerning regulatory 
   changes in 27 CFR Part 5. In the interest of orderly procedure the  subjects 
   will be  heard separately and in the numerical order set forth below:</p>
			   <blockquote>
			     <p> 1. <u>Natural flavor components</u>. The introduction of new processes and techniques and the use of improved distilling  equipment in the production of 
			       distilled  spirits have caused questions to be raised as to the reliability of 
			       distillation  proofs as an infallible guide for distinguishing between distilled
			       spirits  products. For these reasons and in order  to insure that a product 
			       will possess  the taste, aroma, and characteristics generally attributed to products of  that class and type, it is proposed that an additional factor, 
			       based on the  number of &quot;natural flavor components&quot; in the product, be 
			       established  for use, under certain circumstances, as a complement to proof 
			       of  distillation. Natural flavor components  would be defined as meaning 
			       those  volatile materials in the product consisting of esters, acids, and 
			       higher  alcohols. The new criterion would be  applicable (except in the case 
			       of vodka) at  the time of the production gauge. The  natural flavor component 
			       criteria  proposed for the respective distillation proof limitations follow:</p>

               <p> NOTE It is intended that this natural flavor component criterion 
   would be used  to verify product classification when (a) unusual or atypical 
   distilling  methods or procedures are employed, or (b) the proof of distillation  approaches the regulatory maximums or minimums so closely that a more 
   precise  determination is required to insure that the distillate will have 
   the  characteristics generally attributed to that class and type.</p>
               <blockquote>
                 <p> 2. <u>Vodka</u>.  Vodka is a neutral spirits product without distinctive character 
                   aroma, or  taste. Present regulations prescribe  several specific methods for 
                   the  production of such product but grant the Director, Alcohol and Tobacco 
                   Tax Division,  authority to approve other methods of production which will 
                   result in a  product equally without distinctive character, aroma, or taste. 
                   In order to  relieve producers from unnecessary steps in production and from 
                   obtaining  approval thereof, as required, it is proposed to redefine vodka so 
                   as to include  any product regardless of production method which is without 
                   distinctive  character and which contains less than four grams of natural 
                   flavor  components. The proposal would not  change the consumer concept of the 
                   product. A new definition for vodka is proposed to  read substantially as 
                   follows:
                   &quot;'Vodka' is  neutral spirits, so distilled or so treated after distillation with charcoal  or other materials, as to be without distinctive character,
                   aroma, taste, or  color and containing, when bottled, less than four grams of 
                   natural flavor  components consisting of esters, acids, and higher alcohols 
                   per 100 liters at  100&deg; proof, and bottled at not less than 80&deg; proof.&quot;</p>
                 <p> 3. <u>Gin</u>. The present regulatory distinction between  &quot;distilled gin&quot; and 
                   &quot;compound  gin&quot; was drawn shortly after repeal to differentiate the distilled 
                   product from that  made by mixing flavors and essences with alcohol, which 
                   then was considered  to be of inferior quality. Since then,  there have been 
                   improvements in the  art of compounding which result in the production of gin 
                   of comparable  quality. In order to avoid stigmatizing  such products with the 
                   unfavorable word  &quot;compound&quot;, a single standard is proposed for &quot;gin&quot; whether 
                   produced by  distillation or compounding. Gins could  of course bear the 
                   designations  &quot;distilled&quot; or &quot;compound&quot;, where applicable, if the bottler  so 
                   desires. A new definition for gin is proposed to read  substantially as 
                   follows:</p>
                 <p> &quot;'Gin' is a  product obtained by original distillation from mash, or by 
                   redistillation of  distilled spirits, or by mixing neutral spirits, with or 
                   over juniper  berries and other aromatics, or with or over extracts derived 
                   from infusions,  percolations, or maceration of such materials.  It shall 
                   derive its main  characteristic flavor from juniper berries and be reduced at 
                   time of bottling to  not less than 80&deg; proof. Gin produced by  original distillation or by  redistillation may be further designated as 'distilled'.&quot;</p>
                 <p> 4. <u>Blended apple brandy</u>. Laird and Company, Eatontown, New Jersey  has 
                   petitioned that the  class &quot;brandy&quot; be revised to add a new type designation 
                   for &quot;blended  apple brandy&quot; or &quot;blended applejack&quot; in order to offer the
                   consumer a lighter  apple brandy product. The new type  designation proposed 
                   by Laird and  Company reads substantially as follows: </p>
                 <p> &quot;'Blended  apple brandy (applejack)', or 'apple brandy (applejack), a
                   blend', is a  mixture which contains at least 20 percent by volume of 100&deg; 
                   proof apple brandy  (applejack) and not more than 80 percent of neutral 
                   spirits if such  mixture at the time of bottling is not less than 80&deg; proof.&quot;</p>
                 <p> The neutral  spirits component could be derived from any commodity, 
                   including  grain. The label would be required to  show the percentage of 
                   neutral spirits and the name of the commodity  from which distilled.</p>
                 <p> 5. <u>Rum</u>.  &quot;New England rum&quot; is  presently defined as any rum distilled in the 
                   United States  at less than 160&deg; proof. The featuring  of this area designation with the class  designation may likely mislead the consumer into 
                   believing that the  rum was in fact produced in New England. In view of the 
                   possibility of  consumer deception, it is proposed to grant the request of 
                   Felton &amp; Son,  Inc., the only producer of New England rum,  that the deletion 
                   of this standard be  considered.</p>
                 <p> 6. <u>Flavored brandy, flavored gin, flavored  rum, flavored vodka, and flavored </u>
                   <u>whisky</u>. Consumer demand for flavored distilled  spirits products, especially 
                   flavored brandy and  flavored gin, has increased to such a degree as to make 
                   it advisable to  standardize these products in order to maintain product 
                   identity and  quality. The proposed regulatory  definition would in general 
                   follow, with some  additional restrictions if wine is used, the administrative 
                   rules now observed  in considering labels for these products.  It would read
                   substantially as  follows:</p>
                 <p> &quot;'Flavored Brandy', 'flavored gin', 'flavored rum', 'flavored  vodka', 
                   and  'flavored whisky' are brandy, gin, rum, vodka, and whisky, to which have 
                   been added  natural flavoring materials, with or without the addition of 
                   sugar, and  bottled at not less than 70&deg; proof. If  the finished product 
                   contains  more than 2 1/2 percent by volume of wine, the kinds and percentages by  volume of wine must be stated as a part of the designation, except 
                   that a  flavored brandy may contain not in excess of 15 percent by volume of 
                   wine,  without a label statement, if such wine is produced from the same kind 
                   of fruit.&quot;</p>
                 <p> 7. <u>Definition of distilled spirits</u>. In recent years a number of products 
                   have been  made containing as little as 5 percent distilled spirits and as 
                   much as 95  percent wine to which have been added some flavoring ingredients. 
                   These  specialties have been bottled at 48&deg; proof or less but under the 
                   present  regulatory definition are classified as distilled spirits and are 
                   packaged,  labeled, and strip stamped as distilled spirits notwithstanding 
                   the fact  that they are essentially wine products.  It is proposed to amend 
                   the  definition of &quot;distilled spirits&quot; so as to exclude a mixture of wine
                   and  distilled spirits, bottled at 48&deg; proof or less, if the mixture contains 
                   more than  50 percent wine on a proof gallon basis.  Specialties containing 
                   more than  50 percent wine could, of course, continue to be marketed if 
                   properly  labeled and sold as wine products.</p>
                 <p> 8. <u>Mandatory information, net contents, proof  statements, qualifying words,</u> 
                   <u>and  alcoholic ingredients</u>. In order to  lessen the possibility of consumer 
                   deception  by making it easier for him to locate and to better understand key 
                   items of  information describing the contents of containers, it is proposed:</p>
                 <blockquote>
                   <p> A. To  require that all mandatory information be printed on labels in 
                     such a  manner as to be generally parallel to the base on which the container 
                     rests as  it is designed to be displayed (a similar provision is found in the 
                     Model  State Regulation Pertaining to Packages adopted by the National Conference on  Weights and Measures);</p>
                   <p> B. To require the alcoholic  content (proof) to appear on the brand 
                     label of  the product;</p>
                   <p> C. To  prohibit net contents statements from being qualified by any 
                     descriptive term such as, &quot;jumbo,&quot; &quot;full,&quot; &quot;giant&quot;;</p>
                   <p> D. To  require the net contents to appear on the brand label except in 
                     the case  of distilled spirits packaged in containers conforming to the 
                     standards  of fill; and</p>
                   <p> E. To  require that any statement, other than required information, on 
                     a label as  to any of the alcoholic components of the product include the name 
                     and  percentage of all the alcoholic components, except alcoholic coloring, 
                     flavoring,  or blending ingredients used in minute quantities.</p>
                 </blockquote>
                 <p> As  used above &quot;brand label&quot; means the label carrying, in the usual distinctive  design, the brand name of the distilled spirits, and any other label 
                   appearing  on the same side of the bottle as such brand label.</p>
                 <p> 9. <u>Treatment of distilled spirits</u>. Under current regulations, the addition 
                   of any  coloring, flavoring, or blending materials to any class or type of 
                   distilled  spirits, except as otherwise specifically provided, alters the 
                   class and  type thereof. The removal of  constituents from distilled spirits 
                   can also  alter the class and type thereof. In  recent years proprietors 
                   have  repeatedly requested authority to treat whisky prior to bottling with 
                   large  quantities of carbon and/or charcoal, or by leaching and other 
                   processes. It is proposed to  amend the regulations to add a counterpart to the present  limitations on the addition of materials which would cover the 
                   extraction of  materials. The proposed addition to the  regulations would 
                   read  substantially as follows: </p>
                 <p> &quot;The  removal from any distilled spirits of any constituents to such an
                   extent that the  product does not possess the taste, aroma and characteristics generally  attributed to that class or type of distilled spirits alters 
                   the class or  type thereof and the product shall be redesignated accordingly. 
                   In addition, in  the case of straight whisky the removal of any substance 
                   whatsoever,  except such as results from authorized stabilization of the 
                   product within  the limitation prescribed under Section 5025(j), Internal 
                   Revenue Code,  shall be deemed to alter the class or type thereof, and in the 
                   case of any  other whisky the reduction of the natural flavor components 
                   below the  minimum prescribed in the standard of identity for that class or 
                   type shall be  deemed to alter the class or type.&quot;</p>
                 <p> 10. <u>Labeling of bulk imports</u>. Importations of bulk spirits are increasing 
                   and they are  often bottled by a person other than the person responsible for 
                   the  importation. Under present regulations,  when bottled by such a person, 
                   the label must  show the name and address of the person responsible for the 
                   importation, and  in addition either (a) the name of the bottler and the place 
                   where bottled,  or (b) that the distilled spirits were bottled in the United 
                   States for the  person responsible for the importation, e.g. &quot;imported by and 
                   bottled in the United States  for _________________________.&quot;  Compliance with 
                   the requirement  for showing the name and address of the person responsible 
                   for the  importation has proved unnecessarily burdensome in many instances, 
                   particularly  where the identity of such person has become meaningless as a 
                   result of  numerous transfers of the goods. The  statute requires that the
                   identity of the  manufacturer, bottler, or importer be disclosed. In recognition of the  fact that the bottler is, under normal circumstances, responsible 
                   for the product  he bottles, the regulations do not require that the name of 
                   the manufacturer  of domestic distilled spirits be stated if the name of the 
                   domestic bottler  appears. Equal treatment requires that a  similar option be 
                   available in the  case of domestically bottled imported goods.  It is accordingly proposed  to amend the regulations to make optional the showing of the 
                   name and address  of the person responsible for the importation when the name 
                   of the bottler  and the place where bottled are shown.</p>
                 <p> 11. <u>Age certificates</u>. Imported whiskies less than four years old  and 
                   brandies less  than two years old must bear an age statement on the label; age 
                   statements are  optional for all other imported whiskies and brandies. Under 
                   current  regulations, age certificates, issued by a duly authorized official 
                   of the  appropriate foreign government, are required only where the labeling 
                   of the product bears a statement of  age. Although in most cases age certificates are  voluntarily furnished, an age certificate should be required to 
                   establish that  the product is in fact sufficiently matured so that the age 
                   statement may be  omitted. It is proposed to amend the  regulations to require 
                   age certificates  for all imported whiskies and brandies.</p>
                 <p> 12. <u>References to supervision</u>. Present regulations prohibit labels from 
                   stating or  indicating that the distilled spirits were distilled, blended, 
                   made, bottled,  or sold under, or in accordance with any governmental 
                   authorization,  law, or regulations, unless such statement is required or 
                   specifically  authorized by such government. Since  several foreign countries, notably Canada and the United Kingdom, have specifically  authorized 
                   distilled  spirits exported to this country to bear certain statements of 
                   this nature, The  Bourbon Institute, New York,   New York, and Schenley 
                   Industries,  Inc., New York, New York, have requested that the  regulations be amended  so as to permit the label on domestic spirits to bear truthful 
                   statements  that the spirits were distilled, barreled, warehoused, blended, 
                   proofed, or  bottled, as the case may be, under supervision of the United 
                   States  Government. </p>
               </blockquote>
               <p>  Necessarily involved in the consideration of this proposal are the 
   questions  (1) as to whether any such statement should be authorized to 
   appear on  imported products if its appearance is not permitted when sold 
   for  consumption in the country of origin, and (2) as to whether statements 
   of this  character should not be barred on the labels of imported spirits 
   if the  present regulations are not amended so as to authorize the use of 
   similar  statements on domestic spirits.</p>
               <p> Also  appropriate for consideration in connection with this proposal 
   is the  question as to whether foreign products should be permitted to bear 
   the words  &quot;bond&quot;, &quot;bonded&quot;, &quot;bottled in bond&quot;, or like  phrases, if modified 
   by the name  of the country of origin, on any label when the laws of the 
   country in  which the spirits are produced authorize the bottling of spirits 
   in bond and  require or authorize the spirits to be so labeled. Under 
   present  regulations foreign products in order to be so labeled must also 
   meet all  the requirements of United    States law providing for the bottling 
   of domestic  distilled spirits in bond. Such references  on labels would of 
   course  include references on official stamps.</p>
