   27 CFR  Part 5</p>
			   <p> Proprietors of  Distilled Spirits Plants, 
   Importers and  Wholesalers of Distilled 
   Spirits, and  others concerned:</p>
			   <p> This circular  is issued to provide you with a reprint of Treasury Decision 
   6973 which was  published in the Federal Register for September 26, 1968.</p>
			   <p> The new  regulations stem from the public hearing held April 1 through 3, 1968. 
   In general, the  Treasury decision (1) revises the standards of identity for gin and 
   vodka to enable  manufacturers to vary from existing production methods, but in such 
   a manner as not to  change consumer concept of the products; (2) establishes new
   standards of  identity for blended applejack and for flavored brandy, flavored gin, 
   flavored rum,  flavored vodka, and flavored whisky; (3) deletes the standard of 
   identity for New England rum; (4) amends the definition of  &quot;distilled spirits&quot; to 
   exclude products  which contain a preponderance of wine; (5) revises the manner of 
   presentation of  label information to aid the consumer in locating and better understanding key items  describing the container contents; (6) prescribes limits for the 
   extraction of  materials from distilled spirits; and (7) clarifies and liberalizes 
   regulatory  provisions relating to the labeling of bulk imports, age certificates 
   for imported  spirits, and label references to government supervision.</p>

			   <p> (T.D. 6973)</p>
			   <p> PART  5-LABELING AND ADVERTISING OF DISTILLED SPIRITS</p>
			   <p> <u>Miscellaneous Amendments</u></p>
			   <p> DEPARTMENT  OF THE TREASURY 
    Office of Commissioner of Internal Revenue 
   Washington, D. C. 20224</p>
			   <p> TO OFFICERS AND  EMPLOYEES OF
   THE INTERNAL  REVENUE SERVICE 
   AND  OTHERS CONCERNED:</p>
			   <p> Notice of  public hearing to be held in Washington, D. C., beginning on April 
   1, 1968, with  respect to several proposals to amend 27 CFR Part 5, Labeling and 
   Advertising of  Distilled Spirits, was published in the Federal Register on January 
   26, 1968 (33 F.R.  1017). At the conclusion of the hearing  and after a thorough study
   of matters relevant  to the issues the following conclusions have been reached:   </p>
			   <p><u>Subject No. 1  Natural flavor components</u>.</p>
			   <p> <u>Proposal</u> That an additional factor, based upon the number of &quot;natural 
   flavor  components&quot; in the product, be established for use, as a complement to  proof 
   of distillation,  in distinguishing between classes and types of distilled spirits 
   products.</p>
               <p> <u>Discussion </u>Three main factors contribute to the development of the taste, 
   aroma, and  characteristics generally attributed to whiskies, brandies and rums; 
   (a) the fermented  material from which distilled, (b) the manner of distillation, 
   and (c) the types  of containers used for storing or aging.  The present standards 
   of identity rely  on these criteria in distinguishing between types within classes 
   and between  classes of distilled spirits.</p>
               <p> As to the  second factor-manner of distillation-the regulatory controls are 
   expressed in  terms of proof of distillation, and various classes of distilled 
   spirits, or types  of spirits within the classes, are required to be distilled 
   within specific  ranges.</p>
               <p> Current  distillation proof limitations were prescribed over thirty years ago. 
   Since then,  improved distilling equipment and new processes and techniques have been 
   introduced. Laboratory analyses and industry  representations have demonstrated that 
   as a result of  these changes the proof of distillation no longer insures, in every 
   instance, that a  new distillate will possess the characteristics expected from distillation at the  prescribed proofs.</p>
               <p> Thus, the  Treasury Department proposed that an additional factor, based on the 
   number of  &quot;natural flavor components&quot; in the product be established for use,  under 
   certain  circumstances, as a complement to proof of distillation, in distinguishing 
   between the  various classes and types of distilled spirits.  The notice of proposed 
   rule making  contained a table of proposed flavoring component standards. The 
   standards  proposed were developed with the primary intention that compliance therewith be readily  determinable by inexpensive means.</p>
               <p> Evidence was  presented at the hearing that the flavoring components proposed 
   do not include  all of the flavoring components in the distillate. A number of 
   flavoring  components which are present in very minute quantities in the new distillate, but  which contribute to the taste, aroma and characteristics of the finished 
   product, cannot  be readily quantified even when they are susceptible to measurement. 
   For this and a  variety of other reasons, most of the witnesses who testified at the 
   hearing expressed  opposition to the proposal.</p>
               <p> <u>Conclusion</u> The proposal is not adopted. </p>
               <p> <u>Subject No. 2  Revised standard for vodka</u>.</p>
               <p> <u>Proposal</u>. That a new definition of vodka be established  which would include 
   any neutral  spirits, regardless of production method, which is without distinctive 
   character and  which contains less than four grams of natural flavor components per 
   100 liters at  100&deg; proof.</p>
               <p> <u>Discussion</u>. Present regulations prescribe two specific  methods for the production of vodka  but grant the Director, Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Division, authority 
   to approve other  methods of production which will result in a product equally without distinctive  character, aroma, taste, or color. So  long as the finished product 
   offered to the  consumer is without distinctive character, aroma, taste, or color,there appears no  longer to be a need to prescribe specific production procedures 
 or to require  approval of additional production methods.  The proposed new definition of vodka  would relieve producers from these unnecessary requirements, but 
 would not change  the consumer concept of the product.</p>
               <p> <u>Conclusion</u>. The proposal is adopted, modified to delete  the proposed reference 
   to natural flavor  components.</p>
               <p> <u>Subject No. 3 Revised standard for gin</u>.</p>
               <p> <u>Proposal</u>. That a single standard of identity be adopted  for &quot;gin&quot;, whether 
   produced by  distillation or compounding, in place of the present separate standards 
   for  &quot;distilled gin&quot; and &quot;compound gin&quot;. When gins are made solely by distillation, 
   they could  continue to be labeled as &quot;distilled&quot;.</p>
               <p> <u>Discussion</u>. The regulatory distinction between  &quot;distilled gin&quot; and &quot;compound 
   gin&quot; was  drawn shortly after repeal to differentiate the distilled products from 
   those made by  mixing flavors and essences with alcohol.  Currently the production 
   of gin by either  compounding or distilling results in an end product which is indistinguishable as  to taste, aroma, or other characteristics.  Thus the use of the 
   terms  &quot;compound&quot; or &quot;distilled&quot; as a part of the designation is  essentially a distinction without a  difference.</p>
               <p> The adoption of  this proposal would enable producers to vary from existing 
   methods in making  gin, although rectification tax may be incurred in some of the 
   processes.</p>
               <p> <u>Conclusion</u>. The proposal is adopted with slight  modification in the definitional language  proposed. Importers will be given  reasonable time to ascertain 
   the precise  methods of production abroad and to arrange for such label revision as 
   may be necessary.</p>
               <p> <u>Subject No. 4 Establishment of a standard for &quot;Blended Applejack&quot;.</u></p>
               <p> <u>Proposal</u>. That the class &quot;brandy&quot; be revised  to add a new type designation 
   for &quot;blended  apple brandy&quot; or &quot;blended applejack&quot;.</p>
               <p> <u>Discussion</u>. A distiller petitioned for a new designation  for a blend of 
   apple brandy  (applejack) and neutral spirits. The  petitioner testified that such 
   a product would  have greater consumer acceptance than applejack. Analyses of 
   samples of such a  product show that it retains the basic taste, aroma, and characteristics of the  applejack, but with less pronounced flavor.  In order to adequately 
   advise the  consumer that this product is not the same as applejack which is not 
   blended, it would  be designated as &quot;blended applejack&quot; and the label would be 
   required to  disclose the percentage of neutral spirits in the product and the 
   commodity from  which the neutral spirits were distilled.</p>
               <p> <u>Conclusion</u>. The proposal for a standard of identity for  &quot;blended applejack&quot; 
   is adopted. However, inasmuch as the product may contain  neutral spirits from 
   other than fruit,  it is prescribed as a new class of distilled spirits rather than 
   as a type within  the brandy classification. Since the new  product is not a type 
   within the brandy  classification, the proposed designation &quot;blended apple brandy&quot; 
   is not adopted.</p>
               <p> <u>Subject No. 5 Deletion of the standard for &quot;New England  rum&quot;.</u></p>
               <p> <u>Proposal</u>. That the standard of identity for &quot;New England rum&quot; be deleted.</p>
               <p> <u>Discussion</u>. New England  rum is presently defined as any rum distilled in the 
   United States at less than 160&deg;  proof. In addition to eliminating a  geographical 
   designation which  could mislead the consumer into believing the rum was in fact 
   produced in New England, the adoption of the proposal would enable  distillers to 
   mix rum produced in  the United States at less than 160&deg; proof with other rums and 
   label the mixture  as rum without a statement of composition.</p>
               <p> <u>Conclusion</u>. The proposal is adopted.</p>
               <p> <u>Subject No. 6 Flavored brandy, flavored gin, flavored rum, flavored vodka, and </u>
   <u>flavored  whisky.</u></p>
               <p> <u>Proposal</u>. That a new standard be established for  flavored brandy, flavored 
   gin, flavored rum,  flavored vodka, and flavored whisky.</p>
               <p> <u>Discussion</u>. Flavored gin, flavored rum, flavored vodka,  flavored whisky, and 
   especially flavored  brandy, in recent years, have achieved such consumer acceptance 
   that a standard was  proposed in order to maintain product identity and quality. It 
   was also proposed  that the use of wine in these flavored distilled spirits be 
   limited to 2&frac12;  percent by volume of the finished product.  However, in the case of 
   flavored brandies  an additional 12&frac12; percent by volume of wine might be used, without label  disclosure, if the wine is derived from the particular fruit corresponding 
   to the labeled  flavor of the brandy.</p>
               <p> Testimony on  this proposal related primarily to the limitations on the use of 
   wine in flavored  brandies. Most flavored brandy producers  use little or no wine, 
   whereas a few have  used a high percentage of wine in their products. After careful 
   consideration of  this matter it has been concluded that the use of wine may be 
   justified only as a  flavoring ingredient. No significant evidence was submitted 
   which would  establish that the use of quantities of wine in any of these products
   in excess of the  limitations proposed is required to adequately flavor the products. 
   The manufacturer  would not be precluded from using greater quantities of wine, but 
   if he does so he  must disclose such use on the label.</p>
               <p> <u>Conclusion</u>. The proposal to establish a standard of  identity for these 
   products (including  the proposed limitations on the undisclosed use of wine) is 
   adopted.</p>
               <p> <u>Subject No. 7 Amendment of distilled spirits definition.</u></p>
               <p> <u>Proposal</u>. That the definition of &quot;distilled  spirits&quot; be amended so as to 
   exclude a mixture  of wine and distilled spirits, bottled at 48&deg; proof or less, if 
   the mixture  contains more than 50 percent wine on a proof gallon basis.</p>
               <p> <u>Discussion</u>. Products containing not less than 5 percent  distilled spirits 
   and as much as 95  percent wine, to which have been added some flavoring materials, 
   and bottled at 48&deg;  proof or less, are presently classified as distilled spirits. 
   The packaging, labeling,  and strip stamping of these specialties as distilled 
   spirits, even  though they are essentially wine products, may well deceive the 
   consumer as to  product identity. The proposed revision  of the definition of</p>
               <p> &quot;distilled  spirits&quot; would provide significant consumer protection by precluding 
   the labeling of  wine products as distilled spirits.</p>
               <p> <u>Conclusion</u>. The proposal to redefine the term  &quot;distilled spirits&quot; is adopted 
   with slight  modification in the definitional language proposed. Manufacturers of 
   products not  conforming to the new definition will be provided ample time to change
   their labels and  thereafter may package and label such products as wine specialties</p>
               <p> <u>Subject No. 8  Information on labels in regard to net contents, proof of distil</u>
   <u>lation,  qualifying words, and alcoholic ingredients.</u></p>
               <p> <u>Proposals.</u>   </p>
               <blockquote>
                 <p>A. To require that all mandatory information be  printed on labels in such a 
                   manner as to be  generally parallel to the base on which the container rests as it 
                   is designed to be  displayed (a similar provision is found in the Model State Regulation Pertaining  to Packages adopted by the National Conference on Weights and 
                   Measures);</p>
                 <p> B. To require the alcoholic content (proof) to  appear on the brand label of 
                   the product;</p>
                 <p> C. To prohibit net contents statements from  being qualified by any descriptive term such  as, &quot;jumbo&quot;, &quot;full&quot;, &quot;giant&quot;;</p>
                 <p> D. To require the net contents to appear on the  brand label except in the 
                   case of distilled  spirits packaged in containers conforming to the standards of 
                   fill; and</p>
                 <p> E. To require that any statement, other than  required information, on a label 
                   as to any of the  alcoholic components of the product include the name and percentage of all the  alcoholic components, except alcoholic coloring, flavoring, or 
                   blending  ingredients used in minute quantities.</p>
               </blockquote>
               <p> <u>Discussion</u>. Adoption of these proposed changes would make  it easier for the 
   consumer to  locate and better understand key items describing the contents of a 
   container.</p>
               <p> The quantity in  a container is of great importance to the buyer and in the 
   case of distilled  spirits this includes both net contents and alcoholic content. 
   Therefore, the  alcoholic content of the product and the net contents (when not 
   packaged in  containers conforming to the standards of fill) should be shown on 
   the brand  (principal) display label in every instance.  Qualifying adjectives or 
   statements  descriptive of the net contents, for example &quot;giant size&quot; or  &quot;full&quot; 
   quart, may  deceive the consumer as to the actual contents and should be prohibited.
   In addition, the  key items of information should be so placed on the label as to 
   be readily  apparent to the consumer without the need for him to search for them, 
   and this would be  accomplished by having the information appear generally parallel 
   to the base on  which the container rests as it is designed to be displayed, or to 
   appear in some  other equally conspicuous manner.</p>
               <p> Cordials and  liqueurs are not required to bear statements of composition. 
   Thus, under  present regulations, a manufacturer is able to show on the label of 
   such a product  any one or more of the alcoholic ingredients without disclosing the 
   total  composition. Such partial disclosures  may be materially misleading to the 
   consumer. Thus,  if the manufacturer elects to show on the labels of these products</p>
               <p> any of the  alcoholic ingredients, he should be required to show the kinds and 
   percentages of all  of the alcoholic ingredients (other than those used within the 
   2&frac12; percent limitation  for harmless coloring, flavoring, or blending materials); 
   such a requirement  need not apply, however, to the labeling of two or more products 
   which are sold both  separately and in combination, for example, T &amp; B (Triple Sec 
   and Brandy) where  no other references are made to the alcoholic ingredients of 
   either product.</p>
               <p> Many labels now  fully conform to these proposed new rules.  The additional 
   information on the  brand label would not unduly restrict the bottler in creating 
   new and artistic  designs.</p>
               <p> <u>Conclusions</u>. The proposals are adopted with slight  modification. Bottlers 
   will be granted a  reasonable period of time to exhaust stocks of nonconforming 
   labels.</p>
               <p> <u>Subject No. 9 Treatment of distilled spirits.</u></p>
               <p> <u>Proposal.</u> To add, as a counterpart to the present  limitations on the addition 
   of materials, a  limitation on the extraction of materials.</p>
               <p> <u>Discussion</u>. Extensive removal of constituents from  distilled spirits in the 
   preparation of a  product for bottling may result in an alteration of the class and 
   type. In view of the increased treatment of  distilled spirits products, primarily 
   whisky, a need  exists for a regulation to limit the removal of product characteristics generally attributed  to the class or type by which the spirits are labeled. 
   As to distilled  spirits generally, it was proposed that the products after treatment must retain  the taste, aroma and characteristics generally attributed to them. </p>
               <p> In the case of  straight whisky, however, it was proposed that the removal of 
   all substances be  prohibited, except for stabilization purposes as prescribed under 
   section 5025 (j) of  the Internal Revenue Code. Industry  presentations were convincing that in the  case of straight whisky, the removal of as much as 15 percent 
   of the fixed acids,  or volatile acids, or esters, or soluble solids or higher 
   alcohols, or 25  percent of the soluble color may be necessary in order to produce 
   a stable product. Such treatment will not unduly affect the  character of the 
   straight whisky  acquired during maturation.</p>
               <p> <u>Conclusion</u>. The proposal to prescribe regulatory  provisions governing the 
   extraction of  materials from distilled spirits is adopted with modifications.</p>
               <p> <u>Subject No. 10 Labeling of bulk imports</u>.</p>
               <p> <u>Proposal</u>. To make optional label disclosure of the name  and address of the 
   person responsible  for importation of the product when the name of the bottler and 
   the place where bottled  are shown.</p>
               <p> <u>Discussion</u>. Imported bulk spirits are often both bottled  and distributed by 
   a person other than  the person responsible for the importation.  Under present 
   regulations, the  label must show the name and address of the person responsible for 
   the importation,  and in addition either (a) the name of the bottler and the place 
   where bottled, or  (b) that the distilled spirits were bottled in the United States 
   for the person  responsible for the importation, e.g. &quot;imported by and bottled in 
   the United States  for_______________________ .&quot;  Compliance with the requirement 
   for showing the  name and address of the person responsible for the importation has</p>
               <p> proved  unnecessarily burdensome in many instances, particularly where the  identity 
   of such person  has become meaningless as a result of numerous transfers of the 
   goods. The statute requires that the identity of the  manufacturer, bottler, or 
   importer be  disclosed.</p>
               <p> <u>Conclusion</u>. The proposal is adopted.</p>
               <p> <u>Subject No.  11 Age certificates for imported spirits.</u></p>
               <p> <u>Proposal</u>. To require age certificates for all imported  whiskies and brandies.</p>
               <p> <u>Discussion</u>. Under current regulations age certificates,  issued by a duly 
   authorized  official of the appropriate foreign government, are required for imported  whiskies and brandies only when the label of a product bears a statement of 
   age. Although present regulations do not require  such a certificate when a whisky 
   or brandy does  not bear an age statement, a certificate seems necessary even in 
   such cases, in  order to establish that the product meets the minimum age (4 years 
   for whisky; 2  years for brandy) to be exempt from an age statement.</p>
               <p> <u>Conclusion</u>. The proposal is adopted.</p>
               <p> <u>Subject No.  12 Label references to government supervision.</u></p>
               <p> <u>Proposal</u>. To permit the label on domestic spirits to  bear truthful statements 
   that the  spirits were distilled, barreled, warehoused, blended, proofed, or bottled, 
   as the case  may be, under the supervision of the United States Government.</p>
               <p> <u>Discussion</u>. Under existing regulations, except for  distilled spirits bottled 
   in bond,  domestically produced distilled spirits have not been permitted to bear a 
   statement that  such spirits have been distilled, blended, made, bottled, or sold,
   in accordance  with any governmental authorization, law, or regulation. On the other 
   hand, imported  distilled spirits have been permitted by regulation to bear certain 
   statements of  this nature when such statements are specifically authorized or required by the  foreign government involved.</p>
               <p> No  evidence is available of consumer misunderstanding of the statements, 
   appearing on  labels of imported spirits, relating to acts of manufacture performed 
   in accordance  with foreign regulations, and no evidence is available which would 
   indicate that  the consumer would be misled by similar statements with respect to 
   domestic  products.</p>
               <p> <u>Conclusion</u>. The proposal is adopted. Uniform statements are prescribed in 
   order to avoid  possible consumer deception.</p>
               <p>  Accordingly, the following amendments to 27 CFR Part 5 are hereby  adopted:</p>
               <p> Paragraph  1. Section 5.10 (e) is amended by  striking out the period and 
   adding at the  end thereof &quot;, except that this term shall not include mixtures containing wine,  bottled at 48&deg; proof or less, if the mixture contains more than 50 
   percent wine  on a proof gallon basis.&quot;</p>
               <p> Par.  2. Section 5.21 is amended by adding two  new paragraphs (j) and (k) 
   reading as  follows:</p>
               <p> (j) Class 10; flavored brandy, flavored gin,  flavored rum, flavored vodka, 
   and flavored  whisky. &quot;Flavored brandy&quot;,  &quot;flavored gin&quot;, &quot;flavored rum&quot;, &quot;flavored 
   vodka&quot;, and  &quot;flavored whisky&quot;, are brandy, gin, rum, vodka, and whisky,  respectively, 
   to which have  been added natural flavoring materials, with or without the addition 
   of sugar, and  bottled at not less than 70&deg; proof. The  name of the predominant 
   flavor shall  appear as a part of the designation. If  the finished product contains 
   more than 2&frac12;  percent by volume of wine, the kinds and percentages by volume of wine 
   must be stated as  a part of the designation, except that a flavored brandy may contain an  additional 12&frac12; percent by volume of wine, without label disclosure, if the 
   additional wine  is derived from the particular fruit corresponding to the labeled 
   flavor of the  product.</p>
               <p> (k) Class 11; blended applejack. &quot;Blended applejack&quot;(applejack-a  blend) is 
   A mixture which  contains at least 20 percent by volume of 100&deg; proof apple brandy 
   (applejack), aged  for not less than two years, and not more than 80 percent of 
   neutral spirits  if such mixture at the time of bottling is not less than 80&deg; proof.</p>
               <p> Par. 3. Section 5.21 (a) is amended by revising  subparagraph (1) to read as 
   follows:</p>
               <p> (1) &quot;Vodka&quot; is neutral spirits so  distilled, or so treated after distillation 
   with charcoal or  other materials, as to be without distinctive character, aroma, 
   taste, or color and bottled at not less  than 80&deg; proof.</p>
               <p> Par. 4. Section 5.21 (c) is amended to read as  follows:</p>
               <p> (c) Class 3;  gin. &quot;Gin&quot; is a product  obtained by original distillation from 
   mash, or by  redistillation of distilled spirits, or by mixing neutral spirits, with 
   or over juniper  berries and other aromatics, or with or over extracts derived from 
   infusions,  percolations, or maceration of such materials, and includes mixtures of 
   gin and neutral  spirits. It shall derive its main  characteristic flavor from juniper berries and  he reduced at time of bottling to not less than 80&deg; proof. Gin 
   produced  exclusively by original distillation or by redistillation may be further 
   designated as  &quot;distilled&quot;. &quot;Dry  gin&quot; (London dry gin), &quot;Geneva gin&quot; (Hollands  gin), 
   and &quot;Old Tom  gin&quot; (Tom gin) are types of gin known under such designations.</p>
               <p> Par. 5. Section 5.21 (e) is amended by deleting  subparagraph (2).</p>
               <p> Par. 6. Section 5.21 (g) is amended by inserting in  subparagraph 6 &quot;, except 
   that this  provision shall not apply to any product conforming to the standard of 
   identity for  blended applejack&quot; after &quot;have been added&quot;.</p>
               <p> Par. 7. Section 5.22 is amended by adding at the end  thereof a new paragraph 
   (d) reading as  follows:</p>
               <p> (d) The removal from any distilled spirits of any  constituents to such an 
   extent that the  product does not possess the taste, aroma and characteristics 
   generally  attributed to that class or type of distilled spirits alters the class or 
   type thereof, and  the product shall be appropriately redesignated. In addition, in 
   the case of  straight whisky the removal of more than 15 percent of the fixed acids, 
   or volatile  acids, or esters, or soluble solids, or higher alcohols, or more than 
   25 percent of the  soluble color, shall be deemed to alter the class or type thereof.</p>
               <p> Par. 8. Section 5.32 (a) is amended by inserting  after subparagraph (3) the 
   following two new  subparagraphs:</p>
               <p> (4) Alcoholic content, in accordance with Section  5.36.</p>

               <p> (2) In the case  of distilled spirits packaged in containers conforming to the 
   standards of fill  prescribed in Section 5.73 (a), net contents in accordance with 
   Sections 5.37 (a)  and (d).</p>
               <p> Par. 11. Section 5.34 (c) is amended to read as  follows:</p>
               <p> (c) On labels of cordials and liqueurs, the  alcoholic components of the 
   product may, but  need not, be stated.</p>
               <p> Par. 12. Section 5.35 (b) is amended by revising  subparagraph (2) to read as 
   follows:</p>
               <p> (2) On labels of imported distilled spirits  bottled after importation by a 
   person other than  the person responsible for the importation there shall be stated:</p>

   (1) of this  paragraph; or</p>
               <p> (iii) the name and principal place of business in  the United States  of the 
   person responsible  for the importation, if the spirits are bottled for such person, 
   immediately  preceded by the phrase &quot;imported by and bottled in the United States 
   for &quot; (or a  similar appropriate phrase).</p>
               <p> Par. 13. Section 5.37 (d) is amended by inserting in  the first sentence &quot;of 
   a container  conforming to the standards of fill prescribed by Section 5.73 (a)&quot; 
   after &quot;on any  label&quot;.</p>
               <p> Par. 14 Section 5.37 is amended by adding a new  paragraph (e) reading as

   conspicuous,  and&quot; after &quot;on labels by Sections 5.30 5.41&quot;.</p>
               <p> Par. 16. Section 5.41 (b) is amended by inserting  after the second sentence 
   of subparagraph (1)  the following new sentence, &quot;The statements authorized by the 
   Federal Government  to appear on labels for domestic distilled spirits are 'Distilled (produced,  barreled, warehoused, blended, or bottled, or any combination 
   thereof, as the  case may be) under United States (U.S.) Government supervision', 
   or in the case of  distilled spirits bottled under Section 5233, Internal Revenue 
   Code, (26 U.S.C.  5233) 'Bottled in bond under United States (U.S.) Government supervision'.&quot;</p>
               <p> Par. 17. Section 5.46 (b) is amended by striking out  the first sentence and 
   inserting in lieu  thereof, &quot;Scotch, Irish, and Canadian whiskies, imported in 
   bottles, shall not  be released from customs custody for consumption unless accompanied by a  certificate issued by a duly authorized official of the appropriate 
   foreign government  certifying to the age of the youngest distilled spirits in the 
   bottle.&quot;</p>
               <p> Par. 18. Section 5.46 (c) is amended by striking out  the first sentence and 
   inserting in lieu  thereof, &quot;Brandy or cognac, imported in bottles, shall not be released from customs  custody for consumption unless accompanied by a certificate 
   issued by a duly  authorized official of the appropriate foreign government certifying that the age  of the youngest brandy or cognac in the bottle is not less than 
   two years, or if  age is stated on the label, that none of the distilled spirits are 
   of an age less than  that stated. If the label of any rum,  imported in bottles, 
   contains any  statement of age, the rum shall not be released from customs custody 
   for consumption  unless accompanied by a certificate issued by a duly authorized official of the appropriate  country, certifying to the age of the youngest rum in the

   certificate for  such spirits issued by a duly authorized official of the appropriate foreign  government certifying to the age of the youngest distilled spirits.&quot;</p>
               <p> Par. 20.  Section 5.51 (c) is amended by striking out the first sentence and 
   inserting in lieu  thereof, &quot;Brandy or cognac imported in bulk shall not be removed 
   from the plant  where bottled unless the bottler possesses a certificate for such

   certifying that the  age of the youngest brandy or cognac is not less than two 
   years, or if age is  stated on the label of the bottle, that none of the distilled 
   spirits are of an  age less than that stated. If the label  on bottled rum, imported 
   in bulk, bears a  statement of age, the rum shall not be removed from the plant 
   where bottled  unless the bottler possesses a certificate for such spirits issued by 
   a duly authorized official of the appropriate  country, certifying to the age of the 
   youngest rum.&quot;</p>
               <p>  * * * * *</p>
               <p> The amendment of  Section 5.10 (e) shall become effective July 1, 1972. This
   will afford  industry ample time within which to effect necessary changes, at Federal
   and State levels,  to redesignate certain products as wine specialties which are now 
   marked as distilled  spirits products.</p>
               <p> The amendments of  Section 5.32 (c), Section 5.34 (c), Section 5.37 (d) and 
   Section 5.40 (b),  and the additions of new paragraph (j) to Section 5.21, new subparagraphs (4) and  (5) to Section 5.32 (a) and new paragraph (e) to Section 5.37 
   relate to  information appearing on labels of distilled spirits products, and in 
   order to allow  industry an opportunity to make conforming changes, such as obtaining new labels  and disposing of obsolete inventories, these amendments shall 
   become effective  July 1, 1969.</p>
               <p> All other  amendments either relieve restrictions presently contained in the 
   regulations,  generally follow administrative rules now observed, or require very 
   little trade  adjustment, and, thus, they shall become effective on the first day of 
   the month that  begins not less than 60 days after the date of publication of this 
   Treasury decision  in the Federal Register.</p>
               <p> (This Treasury  Decision is issued pursuant to and under the authority contained in 
   49 Stat. 981, as  amended; 27 U.S.C. 205.)</p>
               <p> Inquiries  concerning this circular should refer to its number and be addressed 
   to the Director,  Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Division (Attention: CP:AT:JHL), Washington, D. C. 20224.</p>
