<h2>
<a name="RTFToC1">Three
Labs Enter Historic Partnership with Intel Corp. to Create "Superchips"
</a></h2>

<h3>
<a name="RTFToC2">Pe&ntilde;a
says joint project will be largest CRADA in DOE history
</a></h3>
<p>
<b><i>By Jon Bashor</i></b><p>
<p>
<font size="+2">S</font>cientists from Berkeley Lab will add their expertise in the field of precision
optics to a historic partnership announced last week to develop the technology
for manufacturing future generations of faster, more powerful computer chips.<p>
Members of Berkeley Lab's Center for X-ray Optics will join with scientists at
Lawrence Livermore and Sandia national laboratories in a partnership with a
semiconductor electronics industry consortium led by Intel Corp., the world's
largest manufacturer of computer chips. The partnership will pursue the use of
extreme ultraviolet light to create chips with features as small as 0.1 microns
and smaller. By way of comparison, a human hair is about 80 microns wide.<p>
The resulting "superchips" would allow microprocessors to become 100 times more
powerful and memory chips to store 1,000 times more information than currently
is possible.<p>
By creating chips with smaller and smaller features-- the semiconductor
industry will introduce chips this year with 0.25 micron features--computer
manufacturers will be able to pack more computing capacity into a given chip.
<p>
Secretary of Energy Federico Pe&ntilde;a, participating in a news conference in
San Jose to announce a kick-off three-year, $250 million contract, said the new
technology will permit entire libraries of books to be stored on a single chip.
Computers may be able to conduct intelligent "conversations," in any language,
through voice recognition and response, he said.<p>
Joining Pe&ntilde;a in the announcement were Chairman Emeritus Gordon Moore of
Intel; Advanced Micro Devices Chairman Jerry Sanders; Joe Mogab of Motorola;
Tinsley Optics President Bob Aronno; laboratory directors Charles V. Shank
(Berkeley), Bruce Tarter (Livermore), and Deputy Director John Crawford
(Sandia); and several representatives of computer manufacturing and design
agencies.<p>
Pe&ntilde;a said the partnership, the largest Cooperative Research and
Development Agreement (CRADA) in DOE history, "is the strongest possible
endorsement of the scientific and technical capabilities found at the
Department of Energy's national laboratories."<p>
The three laboratories will form a "virtual national laboratory" with the
Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Limited Liability Company (EUV LLC), headed by
Intel, Motorola, and Advanced Micro Devices. The goal is to have a commercially
proven manufacturing technology for a new generation of computer chip in place
by the early 21st century.<p>
In order to produce such chips, manufacturers must be able to purchase
manufacturing equipment with very precise optics capable of transferring the
intricate patterns onto the chip material. That's where Berkeley Lab comes in.
The Lab will receive about 10 percent of the total research funding.<p>
Extreme ultraviolet light (EUV) and soft X-rays, the type used by CXRO at
Berkeley Lab's Advanced Light Source, are next to each other in the spectrum.
Because of their short wavelengths, the two kinds of light are well suited for
work in the area of microscopy (the smaller the wavelength, the smaller the
feature that you can see) and lithography (the smaller the wavelength, the
smaller feature than can be etched by the light). And because they are very
similar, Berkeley Lab's decade of expertise in this largely untapped field will
make it a key member of the virtual lab partnership.<p>
Under the CRADA, Sandia California will provide the EUV light source and the
recording material, and be responsible for integrating the system. Lawrence
Livermore will provide the critical optics and coatings for the lenses, as well
as the "mask blanks" for making patterns on chips.<p>
Berkeley Lab will provide the EUV measurements to determine the accuracy of the
optics and optical coatings as they are developed, said Dave Attwood, head of
Berkeley's Center for X-ray Optics. Jeffrey Bokor is the team leader for EUV
interferometry, and Jim Underwood is the team leader for EUV reflectometry and
scattering measurements.<p>
Underwood's group will be studying the performance of the multi-layer coatings
on the mirrors used in the manufacturing process, with the goal of improved
optical throughput and coating uniformity. Underwood said his work will be done
on Beamline 6.3.2 at the ALS.<p>
"We have a wealth of experience in this field, which we've been pushing for 10
years," said Attwood. "For this project, we need to make measurements at
wavelengths at which the optics are actually being used. <p>
"Our measurements will focus on how the optical wavefront is distorted as it
reflects from the new optics, then provide information as to how the components
can be improved to further reduce the distortion," Attwood said. "Such fine
detail is essential to the consortium's success, and demonstrates how each lab
is playing an integral role in the success of this project." He noted that
Hector Medecki in CXRO holds the patent on the interferometer for making these
measurements.<p>
One of the difficulties in using this kind of light, Attwood says, is that all
materials absorb at these wavelengths, thereby providing an unusual challenge
in making compatible mirrors and lenses. On the other hand, EUV is also a very
powerful tool for chemistry and materials science, especially at the atomic and
molecular level.<p>
"Optics at these very short wavelengths present their own challenges and the
field was in a very crude state when we began our work at Berkeley in the early
1980s," Attwood said. "With the progress made here, at our partner labs and in
centers around the world, we've made substantial advances in the past decade.
Our goals for the next few years would have been unthinkable 10 years ago."<p>
Under the agreement, optical components developed at Livermore will be brought
to the ALS for testing and measurement. Those EUV measurements will be critical
to understanding and maximizing the coatings and measuring the properties of
the optics once they have been coated, Attwood said.<p>
Bokor's group is adapting optical testing methods for use at the ALS.
Typically, lasers are used for testing lithography optics, but there is no
laser available to test at the EUV wavelength. "Inventing a new method to use
the properties of the ALS is where the innovation is," Bokor said.<p>
"We're looking for perfection at a very high level, because the image has to be
superbly crisp," he said. "In order for it to be crisp, the optics have to be
free of any errors. Our job is to test the optics at the operating wavelength
and put the final stamp of approval on the optics before they are put into the
manufacturing systems."<p>
While still in the development stages, Attwood said the relationship among the
three labs is working "miraculously well, and they are virtually working as a
cohesive research organization."<p>
The EUV lithography approach is just one of three being explored worldwide.
Intel's Moore emphasized that the other processes--one using shadow-casting
techniques with shorter-wavelength x-rays, another using electron beam direct
writing--will continue to be assessed in the race to build a smaller, faster
chip.<p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC3">Annual
DOE On-site Review of Lab Ends on Positive Note
</a></h2>
<p>
<b><i>By Ron Kolb</i></b><p>
<p>
<font size="+2">A</font>fter a long day of meetings, tours and discussions, Martha Krebs, the
Department of Energy's Director for Energy Research, paused to reflect on her
most recent visit to her former workplace.<p>
"I always look forward to coming back to Berkeley to see people excited about
science, and people who can communicate that excitement in a way that is both
understanding of the local setting and sensible in the context of our financial
circumstances," said Krebs, an associate laboratory director here from 1983 to
1993.<p>
With that positive assessment, she concluded the annual DOE On-Site Review of
Berkeley Lab programs. The series of presentations on Sept. 12, which began
with a breakfast conversation with community leaders, showcased the
Laboratory's priority scientific initiatives and addressed the Lab's key
operational issues. <p>
Among the attendees with Krebs were DOE associate directors Dave Nelson and Ari
Patrinos; program directors Toni Joseph, Mark Gilbertson, John O'Fallon, Robert
Waldron, Maurice Katz and John Willis; program manager Dennis Kovar; senior
advisors David Goldman and Marvin Singer; scientists Richard Kelley and Ronald
McKnight, and managers Steve Buswell, Donald Priester and Ray Schwartz.<p>
DOE-Oakland Manager Jim Turner, Deputy Manager Martin Domagala, and Berkeley
Site Office Director Richard Nolan were also participants. Representing the
University of California was Robert Shelton, vice provost for research.<p>
Berkeley Lab Director Charles Shank provided an overview of the Laboratory's
strategic planning and highlighted three initiatives as prospective
developmental areas for the DOE--a scientific investigation of heavy ion fusion
as a potential energy source, a computational science plan to promote
integration of high-performance computing into energy research programs, and
molecular environmental science using the tools of synchrotron radiation at the
Advanced Light Source.<p>
Throughout the day, the DOE visitors were exposed to a wealth of Berkeley Lab
contributions, delivered by their research champions. Associate Laboratory
Director Bill McCurdy addressed computational science issues in the context of
the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), and Life
Sciences Division Director Mina Bissell reflected on the challenges of the
genomics program and the forthcoming "revolution" in biological science in the
21st century.<p>
Elbert Branscomb of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, who heads the
three-lab Joint Genome Institute, noted that the new sequencing facility, which
will open next year in Walnut Creek, will help the labs reach a goal of 20
million base pairs of genes sequenced in 1998.<p>
Accelerator and Fusion Research Division Director Bill Barletta and physicist
Roger Bangerter presented ideas for an inertial confinement fusion program
utilizing heavy-ion drivers. Chemist David Shuh described work on the new
environmental sciences beamline at the ALS. And Division Directors Mark Levine
(Environmental Energy Technologies) and Sally Benson (Earth Sciences) focused
on Berkeley Lab's global climate change activities, including proposals for
national and regional impact assessment strategies.<p>
Between presentations, the group toured the Solenoid Tracker at RHIC (STAR)
time projection chamber, being prepared for delivery to Brookhaven later this
year; the new human genome laboratory building, nearing completion; the
recently opened Hazardous Waste Handling Facility; and new beamlines at the
ALS.<p>
Deputy Director Klaus Berkner offered an overview of administrative and
operations achievements and issues, and EH&amp;S Division Director David McGraw
briefed the review team on the evolving integrated safety management program.<p>
"In the context of what Klaus and David were talking about, I have a lot of
confidence that the Laboratory, in partnership with the DOE Site Office and
Oakland, have put strong systems in place to help the Lab meet the expectations
of the Department in integrating science and safety," Krebs said. "But we're
still in the early stages of this exercise, and I'm looking forward to coming
back next year to see how far into the Lab this component can be observed."<p>
Krebs' day began early with an informal breakfast with a group of community
representatives, including Berkeley Mayor Shirley Dean, City Councilwoman Polly
Armstrong, and Chamber of Commerce Chairman Dana Ellsworth; Fire Prevention
Commission Chairman Jerry Carlin; Berkeley High vice-principal Fred Dunn-Ruiz;
YMCA Administrator Alex Antonio, and Jean Quan, president of the Oakland Board
of Education.<p>
"I was pleased to be able to meet with members of the community who have to
deal with real issues confronting their people, as well as those who are clear
about the benefits this laboratory brings to them, especially the educational
element," Krebs said.<p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC4">Researchers Learning to Mimic Nature with Development of Nanoscale Composites That Can Self-Assemble
</a></h2>
<p>
<b><i>By Paul Preuss</i></b><p>
<p>
<font size="+2">N</font>ature has used self-assembling materials for structures measured in nanometers
(billionths of a meter) for hundreds of millions of years, as components of
living cells. Human attempts at nanoscale manufacture, however, have been
confined mostly to building structural materials a few atoms or molecules at a
time. That state of affairs may be on the verge of change. <p>
Douglas Gin, a researcher in the Materials Science Division and assistant
professor of chemistry at UC Berkeley, has devised a general technique for
engineering nanocomposites that begins with the self-assembly of synthetic
starting materials.<p>
Teeth, bones, and shells demonstrate how cleverly nature assembles different
materials into a variety of useful composites at the cellular level. Bone,
tough but not brittle, consists of layers of collagen protein incorporating
crystals of inorganic calcium phosphate; the same materials in a different
ratio, with only a few percent protein, yield the hardest material produced by
living things, tooth enamel. <p>
Early in the twentieth century chemists learned to coax soap-like surfactants
to assemble themselves into layered films and liquid crystal phases, but
remarkable as they were, these structures lacked nature's sophistication. <p>
Liquid crystals also form the skeleton of Douglas Gin's unique new composites.
First the crystals organize themselves into stacks of miniature tubes which can
be polymerized. The tubes contain a chemical precursor in solution, and once
the liquid-crystal matrix has been locked into place by polymerization, the
filler can be converted to a solid. <p>
Unlike the sort of liquid crystals found in digital displays, which change in
response to temperature or an electromagnetic field, Gin uses "lyotropic"
liquid crystals; these respond to additives and other chemical changes. <p>
"The design of unique lyotropic liquid crystals is the key to everything that
follows," says Gin. He works with polymerizable surfactants consisting of
"amphiphilic monomers"--individual molecules that have both hydrophilic
(water-loving) and hydrophobic (water-fearing) ends (thus
amphiphilic--both-ends-loving). When the monomers of laundry soap form a
droplet in water, all their water-loving heads point outward and their
water-fearing tails point inward--where they may surround a glob of grease or
dirt. The technical name for a soap droplet is "micelle"; by adding more and
more individual molecules, micelles can organize themselves into long
cylinders.<p>
Instead of submerging his monomers in water, Gin reduces the amount of water in
his system and designs monomers to form "inverse" cylindrical micelles with
their water-loving heads inward. Meanwhile the water-fearing tails on the
outside of the tubes seek each other's company, and the tubes--just like a
stack of drain pipes--pack themselves into hexagons, the tightest possible
geometric packing arrangement. After the hexagonal architecture is locked in
place, says Gin, "We can do ordinary synthetic-organic chemistry inside the
channels." <p>
Using two different kinds of monomers and two different filler precursors, Gin
and his colleagues have already demonstrated two novel self-organizing
nanocomposites with unique properties. In one technique the liquid-crystal
matrix has been formed in a solution containing the precursor of a
light-emitting, electrically conducting polymer called PPV. When Gin turns up
the heat, the precursor converts to PPV inside the tubes to form what is
effectively a bundle of long, discrete, exceedingly fine wires. His group has
made uniformly oriented films of this material up to eight centimeters across,
yet only 30 to 100 microns thick. <p>
Nanoscale materials often show markedly different properties from the same
material in bulk, and PPV is no exception: Gin's hexagonal matrix of PPV has
over twice the fluorescence of a similar volume in bulk. <p>
In related work funded by the National Science Foundation, Gin is studying an
entirely different liquid-crystal system, which uses a different monomer to
build the hexagonal-tube framework and a different filler precursor. The
solution includes a small amount of a chemical that generates an acid when
illuminated; in the presence of the acid the precursor converts to silicate
glass, even at room temperature--so when Gin turns on the light ... voila!<p>
The resulting composite has a fine, nanoscale structure quite unlike that of
normal amorphous glass or plastic. Gin and his colleagues describe it as "a
tough, pale-yellow, slightly opaque, glassy material ... completely insoluble
in common organic solvents and water." It promises unusual properties,
including hardness, now under investigation.<p>
The two composites so far created using custom-made lyotropic liquid crystals
are promising steps on the path to true nanometer-scale materials engineering.
<p>
"Three years ago I started with this crazy idea that self-assembling liquid
crystals could be used to make nanomaterials in bulk," says Gin. "Now my new
graduate students make a hundred grams a week of some of these liquid crystals,
just as a training exercise. I think we have a viable system."<p>

<a name="RTFToC6">DOE-UC
Agree to Renew Lab Contracts
</a></h2>
<p>
<font size="+2">A</font>fter more than a year of negotiations, the U. S. Department of Energy and the
University of California have agreed upon new five-year contracts that would
permit UC to continue its management of the national laboratories at Berkeley,
Livermore, and Los Alamos. If approved by the Regents and DOE, the contracts
will run concurrently until September 2002.<p>
UC has managed the three laboratories since their respective inceptions. The
labs employ a combined UC workforce of more than 17,000 people and operate on
federally funded budgets totaling about $2.4 billion. As proposed, the new
contracts will continue the performance-based management system introduced with
the 1992 contracts. The success of that system won acclaim for the DOE/UC
partnership as an "exemplary model" by Vice President Al Gore's National
Performance Review study. The new contracts will also continue the preservation
of scientific and intellectual freedom at the laboratories; and the
administration by UC of benefit and retirement plans for laboratory
employees.<p>
UC is to receive $14 million a year for operating costs that are not otherwise
reimbursed by the government, and for discretionary research at the
laboratories. This fee may be increased or decreased based on results of each
lab's annual performance appraisal. DOE is to also provide $11 million annually
as a fixed payment for the indirect costs of managing the labs and up to $4.5
million a year to fund the UC Laboratory Administration Office. The new
contracts would allow UC to terminate one or more of the agreements upon 18
months' notice.<p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC7">Pe&ntilde;a
to Speed Lab Reforms
</a></h2>
<p>
<font size="+2">E</font>nergy Secretary Federico Pe&ntilde;a has pledged to members of the Secretary
of Energy Advisory Board (SEAB) that the pace of management reforms at the
national laboratories will increase. Admitting that "we've not made sufficient
progress" on the reforms called for in the 1995 Galvin report, Pe&ntilde;a
embraced SEAB's request that DOE draw up specific plans to restructure the
multibillion dollar research efforts at the labs. The major goals are to reduce
red tape, bring in more outside researchers, and develop a long-range strategic
plan that would outline the cost, purpose, and importance of proposed new
initiatives. Pe&ntilde;a promised SEAB that Ernest Moniz, the MIT physicist
nominated to be DOE's next Under Secretary, will lead the reform effort once he
has been confirmed. In the meantime, responding to SEAB criticisms that
decisions on new facilities are made on a piece-meal basis, Pe&ntilde;a has
asked Martha Krebs, head of the Office of Energy Research, to oversee the
creation of a "road map" for new facilities over the next 15-20 years. Krebs
has also been asked, in her role as chair of DOE's R&amp;D Council (a group of
senior DOE managers), to develop a plan that will reduce the amount of overlap
in lab management. Delegating greater management responsibility to the labs is
one option that will be explored.<p>
Following his meeting with SEAB, Pe&ntilde;a also announced the creation of a
new task force to advise DOE on how it can more effectively use its resources
at the national laboratories to bolster math and science education in this
country at all levels. The Secretary has appointed Hanna Gray, a history
professor and former president of the University of Chicago, to chair this task
force. At one time, DOE spent as much as $70 million a year on education but
has nothing allocated for it this year. The Department has requested $10
million for science education in FY-98; Senate appropriators have approved this
request.<p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC8">Too
Much Light?
</a></h2>
<p>
<font size="+2">T</font>he balanced budget accord reached by the White House and Congress this summer
calls for level spending through 2002. As reported in a recent issue of
Science, this prospect has led the Department of Energy to create a blue-ribbon
panel of 17 scientists whose task is to advise DOE on the fate of its four
synchrotron light sources. About $200 million or nearly one-third of DOE's $650
million budget for basic energy science is spent on the operations of the four
machines--Berkeley Lab's Advanced Light Source ($18 million); Argonne Lab's
Advanced Photon Source ($76 million); Brookhaven's National Synchrotron Light
Source ($25 million); and the Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory at SLAC ($17
million). Both the ALS and APS are third-generation light sources, so-called
because they were designed to make optimal use of high-performance undulator
magnets--the premier sources of synchrotron light. The other two machines are
older, second-generation light sources whose x-ray beams are not as bright.
Nonetheless, all four machines are extensively used because the demand for time
on x-ray beamlines across a broad range of R&amp;D efforts is booming. DOE
officials acknowledge that current funding levels are insufficient to keep all
four facilities operating at capacity and at the same time make plans for new
"fourth-generation" light sources.<p>
"They are slicing the salami thinner and thinner," ALS director Brian Kincaid
told Science. "All the facilities will cross into the red within a year or
two."<p>
The DOE panel is to make recommendations on whether DOE should sacrifice one of
the older facilities, and if so, which one. Given the diversity of uses on the
newer and older machines, few in the user communities want to see any of the
machines shut down. Instead, it has been suggested that since there has been a
huge increase in light source use by biological and earth scientists, the
National Institutes of Health and the Environmental Protection Agency should
share in the costs of beamline operations. Another idea is to separate
operations funding from funding the next generation of light sources. The
panel's recommendations should be forthcoming at the end of this month.<p>

Perseverance Hall. The awards, established this year to honor the unsung heroes
behind major scientific discoveries, included a citation and $3,000 cash prize,
and were presented by nuclear chemist Albert Ghiorso.<p>
This year's honorees were Donald Syversrud of the Engineering Division, who was
cited for his outstanding service as an accelerator technician since 1978 at
the Laboratory; Leon Archambault of the Engineering Division, for his
impressive and exemplary service as an accelerator technician and engineer at
the Lab; and John Meneghetti of the Accelerator and Fusion Research Division,
who played a key role in the construction and operation of the machines of
science that have been the backbone of the research performed at the
Laboratory.<p>
Syversrud, Ghiorso said, was very active in the tests undertaken to show the
feasibility of the Meneghetti cryogenic liner proposed for the Bevatron Vacuum
Upgrade needed for the Bevalac project. At the SuperHILAC he became leader of
the small group responsible for all of the vacuum systems, and, especially
important, the ion sources used in the three injectors. He also worked closely
with Nitschke in support of OASIS (On-line Apparatus for SuperHILAC Isotope
Separation), a fast, efficient, on-line mass separator for studying
radionuclides.<p>
Archambault, who also worked closely with Nitschke, played a central role in
the creation of various instruments used for many of the scientific
experiements at the HILAC and SuperHILAC. Among these were the OASIS project,
and TAS (Total Absorption Spectrometer), a device that could determine the
absolute masses of radionuclides. He was involved with the construction of a
test facility for producing radioactive ions for use in Nitschke's proposed ISL
accelerator complex, and many other projects.<p>
John Meneghetti, who Ghiorso called an "engineering technologist" because of
his many talents, participated in the construction of most of the major
accelerators at Berkeley (MFE, 88-Inch Cyclotron, ERA, SuperHILAC, BevaLac, and
ALS). In doing so, he trained a number of the people who  became the skilled
core of the accelerator technician group vital to the Laboratory. Particularly
noteworthy was his invention of an innovative cryogenic vacuum liner for the
Bevatron, which proved crucial to enabling the BevaLac to accelerate very heavy
ions with adequate intensity. He worked with Nitschke on many projects in
connection with the SuperHILAC and its experiments.<p>
Guest speakers at the Monday afternoon ceremony included Lab Deputy Directors
Pier Oddone and Klaus Berkner, and Associate Director-at-Large Glenn Seaborg.
The awards ceremony was followed by a well-attended reception.<p>
The J.M. Nitschke award is made through the East Bay Community Foundation, with
funds from the estate of the late Michael Nitschke, a long-time physicist in
the Nuclear Science Division who died in 1995. A protege of Ghiorso and nuclear
chemist Earl Hyde, Nitschke played a prominent role in the discovery of element
106 (seaborgium) and in uncovering the chemical properties of elements 104 and
105 (rutherfordium and hahnium). He was later the driving force behind the
concept of accelerating short-lived radioactive nuclides.<p>

<a name="RTFToC14">Lab-Developed
Technology Allows Remote Collaborations Throughout DOE Complex
</a></h2>
<p>
By Jon Bashor<p>
<p>
<font size="+2">W</font>ith technical and scientific support from Berkeley Lab, Energy Secretary
Federico Pe&ntilde;a received a hands-on lesson in the capabilities of the
collaborative tools being developed for scientific research by DOE.<p>
Using MBone technology developed here, the tools allow scientists at various
DOE sites to remotely access and operate experimental facilities in other parts
of the DOE complex. Such tools are a key component of the DOE2000 program to
create "laboratories without walls." Participating in the Aug. 28 demonstration
was Structural Biology scientist Jeff Pelton and computer scientist Deb
Agarwal.<p>
From his office in Calvin Lab, Pelton uses a computer and network connections
to remotely operate a spectrometer at Pacific Northwest National Lab in
Richland, Wash. The PNNL machine, which cost $2 million and is more powerful
than spectrometers at Berkeley Lab, will help Pelton characterize the structure
of Heat Shock Factor Protein, a DNA-binding protein. Pelton is just beginning a
four-month series of experiments, lasting from five minutes to three days, on
samples he sends to the Richland lab.<p>
"Using my workstation and the Internet, I'll log into their spectrometer and
see the control screen as if I were sitting at their console," Pelton said. In
the process, he will also be actively collaborating with researchers at PNNL.
An electronic notebook will allow them to share up-to-the minute lab notes, and
data and videoconferencing tools will enable them to do real-time
collaborations.<p>
During his visit to PNNL, Pe&ntilde;a dropped by the lab where Pelton will be
doing his remote-control research. Using audio and video links between
computers, Pelton explained to Pe&ntilde;a what he'll be doing. Pe&ntilde;a
congratulated Pelton for adapting to this new way of doing science, adding,
"That's terrific."<p>
Working behind the scenes to make sure the Lab, PNNL and a college in
Washington were all connected for the demonstration was Agarwal, who is with
the Lab's Computer Science Research Department. Agarwal has helped develop some
of the collaborative tools in support of DOE2000, a program to make such remote
collaborations between scientists an integral part of future research. She has
also demonstrated the technology to various DOE audiences.<p>
Jim Myers, project leader for collaboratories at PNNL, said he thinks these
tools will have tremendous value. A Ph.D. chemist from Berkeley, Myers said he
thinks he can help facilitate more chemistry research developing collaborative
tools than by working in a chemistry lab himself. Among the tools Myers has
helped developed are the electronic notebook and televiewer that Pelton will
use during the course of his work.<p>
"Congratulations for doing a great job," Pe&ntilde;a told those linked for the
demonstration. "It's very impressive."<p>

Shows Environmental Good Will at Berkeley Marina
</a></h2>
<p>
<font size="+2">A</font> record number of employees turned out to clean up a strip of Berkeley beach
this year as part of the Lab's celebration of Pollution Prevention Week, Sept.
15-19. Nearly 40 volunteers picked up trash, plastic bottles, cans, styrofoam,
cigarette butts, and even old clothes along a stretch of beach at the Berkeley
Marina.<p>
In a special ceremony following the beach clean-up, the Laboratory presented a
check for $25,000 to the City of Berkeley to initiate a project to design and
build an unusual demonstration building constructed of straw bales. The
building, which is being partially funded by the Laboratory and the Department
of Energy, will be used to house the new Shorebird Park Environmental Learning
Center. The proposed building will be a showcase of environmentally sensitive
