<p><a name="3a"></a>A.  COURSE OF PROCEEDINGS

<p>	On November 20, 2002, defendant John F. Triplett was indicted on one
count of violating 18 U.S.C. &#167;371 for conspiring to violate the mail fraud and wire 
fraud statutes (18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167;1341, 1343, and 1346).  The indictment charged that
Triplett, as Senior Project Manager in the parts department of the Henry Pratt
Company (Pratt), conspired to: (a) defraud Pratt; (b) obtain money from Pratt by
means of false and fraudulent pretenses, representations, and promises; and (c)
deprive Pratt of its right to Triplett's honest services.  Triplett carried out the
scheme by, among other things, concealing the true source of certain surplus
equipment he arranged for Pratt to purchase, and by concealing the fact that he
was receiving substantial kickbacks on those purchases.  R1:4.<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a>

<p>	On April 18, 2003, a jury convicted Triplett on all charges.  R90.

<p>	On July 31, 2003, the district court sentenced him to 51 months in prison
and a $10,000 fine, and ordered restitution in the amount of $86,512.02.  R107.

<p>	Triplett filed a notice of appeal on August 7, 2003.  R108.  He did not seek
bail pending appeal, and began serving his sentence on October 20, 2003.

<p><a name="3b"></a>B.  STATEMENT OF FACTS

<p><ol><li><u>Background</u></ol>

<p>	Pratt manufactures valves used in water and wastewater treatment plants
and nuclear power plants.  R116:3.  Nuclear valves are made to exacting
specifications set by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), and
all valves must be certified as complying with those specifications before they can
be placed in use.  R116:21-23.<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a>  Every nuclear valve made by Pratt has a unique
serial number that is maintained by Pratt.  Pratt also maintains records about the
valve's "pedigree" (materials used and other information about the valve's
manufacture and testing), and the plant where it is to be used.  R116:23-25, 87-89;
R123:165.

<p>	When a nuclear power plant needs to replace a Pratt valve, it can only use a
Pratt valve that is of the same type as the original.  The customer can have Pratt
manufacture a new valve, which takes 42 to 52 weeks, or it can have Pratt
refurbish, retest, and re-certify a surplus valve &#151; a process that takes only four to
eight weeks.  Since time is often of the essence, power plant customers regularly
order refurbished valves for replacement.  This is done through Pratt's parts
department.  R116:5-6, 23-27, 73, 89-91; R124:390.

<p>	Pratt does not maintain an inventory of new replacement nuclear valves
because there is limited demand for them.  Nor does it maintain an inventory of
surplus valves.  Rather, surplus valves and valve parts are purchased when needed
to meet a particular customer's requirements.  R116:25-28; R124:388-90.  As a
practical matter, only Pratt can rebuild and recertify its own valves, and surplus
Pratt valves are of no use to anyone but Pratt and its customers.  R116:27-28, 32-33, 89; R124:412-13.

<p>			Triplett worked for Pratt for 30 years until his retirement on December 31,
1997.  R116:6, 20.  During the time covered by the indictment, Triplett was the
Senior Project Manager in the parts department, reporting directly to the head of
the department, Nick Polito.  R116:7.  Triplett was Pratt's expert on nuclear valves
and related equipment, and he handled virtually all customer requests for such
materials.  R116:8, 23-24, 30; R124:384-86.  Thus, Triplett was generally the first
Pratt employee to learn that a nuclear power plant needed a replacement valve. 
R116:49; R124:386-87.  Once Triplett found out that a nuclear plant needed a
replacement valve, he had the responsibility to locate a surplus valve and obtain it
at the lowest possible price.  R116:32-33, 102; R123:113, 124-29.  Triplett then
would develop a "cost proposal," which recommended (l) a buying price and a
supplier, and (2), a selling price (which included a gross profit margin) to the
customer, that reflected the cost of the valve and other materials, and the cost to
refurbish and recertify the valve.  Although the cost proposal needed the approval
of Polito and others at Pratt, Triplett's purchasing and pricing recommendations
were routinely adopted because his superiors relied on his experience and
judgment.  R116:33, 37-39, 93-4, 113-14 (Polito never once questioned the
reasonableness of Triplett's price recommendations); also R124:382-84.

<p>	Pratt's targeted gross profit margins on nuclear products was 75% to 85%,<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a>
but it did not always achieve those levels because of market constraints.  R116:74-75, 94-95, 116; R124:412.   With respect to the valves involved in this case,
Triplett's buying decisions and resulting cost recommendations yielded profit
margins that fell far short of target levels.  R116:106-18; GX 35, 37 (gross profit
margin of 24.24%).<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a>

<p>	As an employee of Pratt, Triplett was subject to the company's standards of
conduct which prohibited employees from giving or receiving bribes, kickbacks or
any other payments in exchange for purchasing decisions; prohibited employees
from having relationships with suppliers that appeared to have or could cause a
conflict of interest; and prohibited employees from personally profiting from a
business opportunity.  GX 28 at 3-6, 8-9.  Triplett signed a certification that he
was aware of and in compliance with these standards of conduct.  GX 27.  Triplett
admitted at trial, however, that he knowingly violated these standards in the course
of his employment by engaging in the acts charged in this conspiracy.  R124:451-62.

<p><ol type="1" start="2"><li><u>The Conspiracy</u></ol>

<p>	Pumps, Valves &amp; Equipment, Inc. d/b/a/ The Scruggs Company (Scruggs),
owned and operated by Jimmy and Edwin (Ted) Scruggs, sold pumps, valves, and
other water-related equipment in Texas.  R123:139-41.  Scruggs had been a
commissioned sales representative and distributor of Pratt water and waste water
treatment valves and products in Texas for many years.  R116:57-59; R123:141-44.

<p>	Jimmy Scruggs had known Triplett for 30 years through his dealings with
Pratt.  Some time prior to January 1996, a representative of J &amp; R Valve Products
(J &amp; R), a Texas company dealing in surplus valves, called Jimmy Scruggs to see
if he would be interested in purchasing in excess of 100 surplus butterfly valves,
which J &amp; R had purchased at auction and valued at a million dollars, but was
willing to sell for $250,000.  R123:147-49; GX 105.  When Jimmy Scruggs
reviewed the list of valves, however, he realized they were nuclear valves
manufactured by Pratt.  He then told J &amp; R he was not interested because there
were no nuclear power plants in Scruggs' Texas territory that used Pratt valves,
and only Pratt or one of its nuclear power plant customers would have a use for
such valves.  R123:148-49, 207-08.

<p>	A few months later, however, Triplett told Jimmy Scruggs he was looking
for a certain type of Pratt nuclear valve.  Jimmy Scruggs remembered the list of
valves he had received from J &amp; R and let Triplett know what was on it. 
R123:149-50.  Triplett told Jimmy they had "got a gold mine."  R123:151. 
Triplett explained that the materials to make the original valves could not be
purchased anymore and if a nuclear plant needed a valve in a hurry they could use
these surplus valves, after having them recertified.  R123:151-152.  Jimmy told
Triplett that J &amp; R had indicated that the price for the valves was negotiable, and
Triplett told Jimmy to see if they would take $10,000 to $12,000 for the lot. 
R123:152.  Triplett offered to pay half.  R123:153.  Eventually they negotiated a
price of $17,500 for the 100 or so valves in question.  R123:153-54.  Triplett told
Jimmy Scruggs to take Triplett's half of the purchase price out of his profits on the
subsequent sales.  R123:157.  Originally, they anticipated that they would sell the
valves directly to Pratt's power plant customers who would then send the valves to
Pratt to be refurbished.  But Triplett later told Jimmy that the power plants did not
want to go through the process of setting up another authorized vendor (which
could take weeks or months), so Triplett and Jimmy Scruggs agreed they would
sell the valves to Pratt for resale to the power plants.  R123:157-58; R121:8.

<p>	Triplett and Scruggs knew, however, that Pratt would not be willing to buy
the valves from Scruggs.  R123:158-160, 236-41; R124:403.<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a>  If Nick Polito,
Triplett's boss, had known that Scruggs was the source of the valves, he would
have wanted to find out from Jimmy Scruggs why he was selling the valves in the
first place, and, knowing that Scruggs would have no other use for the valves
except to sell them to Pratt, Polito would have been in the driver's seat to bargain
down the price.  R116:61-64.

<p>	Triplett and Scruggs did not tell Pratt that Triplett himself was part owner of
the valves and would be receiving half the profits of the sales, because then they
never would have been able to execute the scheme.  R116:60; R123:176;
R124:413.  Indeed, Triplett knew that if Polito was aware of his involvement in
these sales, he would probably have been fired.  R116:60; R124:413, 461.

<p>	Triplett told Jimmy Scruggs to try to find a company that would front for
Scruggs by shipping the valves to Pratt and putting its name on the invoices. 
R123: 158-61, 236; R124:403.  Jimmy's brother and partner, Edwin (Ted)
Scruggs, then got in touch with his neighbor, Christopher Mealey.  Mealy owned a
business called Eurotech Industries, Inc. (Eurotech) that made machine parts. 
R117:2-3; R123:237-40.  Ted explained to Mealy that Pratt would not deal with
Scruggs directly and that they would get a better price for the valves if they were
sold in Eurotech's name.  R117:7-10; R123:240-41.  Mealey agreed to ship and
invoice the valves through Eurotech in exchange for five percent of the selling
price.  R123:161-162, 236-240; R117:7-10.

<p>	Triplett and Scruggs purchased the valves from J &amp; R at an average price of
$175.  R123:163; GX 101.  They then went over the list, valve by valve, and
Triplett told Jimmy Scruggs what prices to charge Pratt for each item on the list. 
These prices ranged from $3400 for a 6" valve to $16,000 for a 24" valve.  GX
105.  Eventually 40 of these valves were sold to Pratt through Eurotech for a total
price of $216,755.  R123:165-66, 169; GX 9-25, 301.

<p>	Each time Triplett found a Pratt customer for one of the valves, he would
notify Jimmy Scruggs who in turn would notify Pam Wayhan, who ran the office
at Eurotech and had been apprised of the scheme (R118:3-4; R117:10-11), that a
purchase order from Pratt would be forthcoming.  Jimmy Scruggs would provide
Eurotech with the serial number of the valve to be shipped and the invoice price
that Triplett and Scruggs had worked out.  Pam Wayhan then prepared the invoice
and arranged for the shipment.  R123:166-75; R117:10-12; R118: 5-6; R124:405-06.

<p>	On each sale, Eurotech retained five percent of the selling price and
remitted the remainder to Scruggs.  R123:173; R118:8-12.  Elaine Scruggs, the
mother of Jimmy and Ted, and the bookkeeper for Scruggs, then transferred
Triplett's half of those profits by wire from the Scruggs' bank in Texas to
Triplett's bank in Illinois and, after Triplett moved to Georgia in 1998, to his bank
in Georgia by wire and check.  R123:176-86; GX 140, 141.  Eurotech's profits on
these sales totaled approximately $10,000.  R117:12.  Scruggs and Triplett
received over $100,000 each.  R118:12; R123:177-79; GX 140, 516.

<p>	In addition to these sales through Eurotech, there were occasions when
Triplett learned from a Pratt customer that it needed a valve or part, and then
arranged with Scruggs to sell the item directly to the customer, depriving Pratt of
the sale and dividing between Triplett and Scruggs the profits that should have
gone to Pratt.  R123:186-192; GX 142 (sale of 84" Pratt butterfly valve to
Carolina Power and Light for $35,000); GX 144, 145 (sale of "actuator"<a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a>
purchased from J &amp; R valve for $150, and sold to City of Ft. Lauderdale for
$3,045).

<p>To refute Triplett's primary, indeed sole, defense that he did not "intend" to
defraud Pratt, the government showed that Triplett had engaged in similar
kickback schemes with other suppliers between 1994 and 1998.  Triplett arranged
with Jimmy Matheson of H * E Engineered Equipment Co. (H * E) to have H * E
buy three valves for $1,500 each, which they later sold to Pratt for $13,500 each. 
Triplett received $17,250 from Matheson out of the profits.  R124:303-305; GX
359.  Matheson said that if Triplett were not getting half the profits, H * E would
have sold the valves to Pratt for less.  R124:306.  Triplett also gave Kathy Cain of
Environmental Consulting, Inc. (ECI) information as to where she could purchase
a surplus valve and told her to offer $1,000 for it.  R124:318, 323-24.  Triplett
then had Pratt buy the same $1,000 valve from ECI for $16,500, getting half the
profit ($7,500) from Cain's employer as a kickback.  R124:323, 367-68 (Triplett
admitted scheming with ECI and admitted that if his superiors at Pratt knew ECI
had paid $1,000 for the valve that is all Pratt would have paid); R124:420.  And
Triplett was paid a total of $21,400 by Industrial Valve Sales &amp; Service, Inc. (IV)
on sales that IV made to Pratt pursuant to Triplett's purchasing recommendations. 
R124:352-53; GX 260.

<p>	On other occasions, Triplett offered to reduce the price of Pratt parts to a
customer in exchange for receiving half the reduction as a kickback.  R124:293-301; R124:420-21 (Triplett admitted such kickbacks); GX 356 (Triplett was paid
$9,925.70 for reducing price on 16 "operators"<a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a> sold to H * E, and for a surplus
Pratt ball valve sold to a Pratt customer by H * E at Triplett's direction);
R124:318-19, 325-326; GX 407 (Triplett received $25,969 for the "discounts" he
gave on the sale of Pratt parts to ECI and for the sale of a surplus valve back to
Pratt); R124:458 (Triplett admitted receiving over $25,000 in kickbacks from
Cain).  Triplett sometimes even sent bills to these co-conspirators itemizing the
money they owed him for these kickbacks; but he cautioned them to send the
payments to his home rather than his business.  R124:298-99, 320-22; GX 354,
408-09.

<p>	In finding Triplett guilty, the jury returned a special verdict form indicating
they unanimously agreed that the government had proved all of the allegations in
the indictment:  that Triplett had conspired, through the use of both the U.S. mail
and interstate wire transmissions, to defraud Pratt, to obtain money from Pratt by
false and fraudulent representations, and to deprive Pratt of Triplett's honest
services.  R90.

<p><a name="4"></a><center>SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT </center>


<p>	Triplett did not dispute any of the relevant facts at trial.  He admitted that he
knowingly violated company standards of conduct by taking kickbacks on sales,
and by divulging confidential company information to outsiders.  He also admitted
he had a conflict of interest by participating with Scruggs in the sale of valves to
Pratt, and failing to divulge the fact that he and Scruggs were partners in the sales. 
Nor did Triplett dispute the amount &#151; over $100,000 &#151; that he received as a result
of these schemes.  His only purported defense was the false factual claim that Pratt
did not suffer any "economic harm" because Pratt made a profit on each
refurbished surplus valve it sold.  The jury rightly rejected this defense.  The court
properly took the kickbacks received by Triplett and his co-conspirators into
account in calculating Triplett's offense level under USSG &#167;2F1.1.  And, because
Pratt lost almost $200,000 in profits that went into the pockets of Triplett and his
co-conspirators, the court properly ordered restitution. 

<p>	An abuse of trust enhancement was proper because Triplett admitted that he
had abused Pratt's trust, and abuse of trust is not otherwise included in the offense
level for fraud under USSG &#167;2F1.1.  The enhancement for role in the offense was
required because the conspiracy involved five or more participants, including the
two employees of Eurotech who, knowing of the conspiracy's objective to defraud
Pratt of money by deceiving it as to the source of the valves, acted to further it.

<p>	The district court did not clearly err in counting as relevant conduct for
purposes of sentencing similar kickback schemes that Triplett engaged in with
other suppliers of Pratt valves that took place immediately before and during the
time of the charged offense. The obstruction of justice enhancement was required
because Triplett admitted at trial that he had destroyed evidence of his secret
agreement with Jimmy Scruggs after learning that the FBI was investigating his
kickback activities, and because the district court's findings that Triplett attempted
to influence the testimony of potential witnesses about these dealings were not
clearly erroneous.

<p>	There was no constructive amendment of the indictment because the
evidence at trial relating to Pratt's lost profits and Scruggs' costs was used to
prove the charges in the indictment that Triplett defrauded Pratt of money and his
honest services.

<p><a name="6i"></a><ol type="I"><li>THE DISTRICT COURT PROPERLY APPLIED A TWO-LEVEL
ENHANCEMENT FOR ABUSE OF TRUST</ol>


<p>	Triplett claims that the court improperly applied a two-level enhancement
under USSG &#167;3B1.3 because abuse of trust was included in the base offense level,
or as a specific offense characteristic of, the "honest services" fraud of which he
was convicted.  Def. Br. 9-11.  But the six-question special jury verdict confirms
that Triplett was convicted of conspiring to use the mails and interstate wires to
defraud his employer, and to obtain money from his employer by false and
fraudulent pretenses, in addition to depriving his employer of his honest services. 
Because Triplett does not claim that abuse of trust is included in the base offense
level for schemes to defraud and obtaining money by false and fraudulent
pretenses, the abuse of trust enhancement was properly applied for that fraud.

<p>	Moreover, the sentencing guidelines and cases on which Triplett relies also
plainly show that an abuse of trust enhancement was properly applied even if
Triplett had only been convicted of "honest services" fraud.  USSG &#167;3B1.3<a href="#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a>
requires a two-level sentence enhancement when "the defendant abused a position
of public or private trust, or used a special skill, <u>in a manner that significantly
facilitated the commission or concealment of the offense</u>."  The adjustment "may
not be employed if an abuse of trust or skill is included in the base offense level or
specific offense characteristic."  In this case, the enhancement was appropriate
because (1) Triplett abused a position of trust "in a manner that significantly
facilitated the commission or concealment of the offense," and (2) abuse of trust <u>is
not</u> "included in the base offense level or specific offense characteristic" for fraud.

<p>	A.  Triplett held a position of trust with Henry Pratt and abused that trust "in
a manner that significantly facilitated the commission . . .  of the offense."  USSG
&#167;3B1.3.  A 30-year veteran employee, Triplett was considered by Pratt to be its
expert on nuclear valves, a highly regulated and unique product.  He was generally
the first to learn of a customer's need for surplus valves and, because Pratt trusted
him, Triplett had the responsibility to secure the appropriate valves at the lowest
cost.  He knew he was prohibited from taking kickbacks:  indeed, because of his
special position of authority and trust, he was one of a limited number of Pratt
employees required to sign an affidavit saying he had not taken kickbacks.  GX
27, 28, <u>see</u> <u>supra</u> pp. 5-6.

<p>	Triplett, however, used the proprietary customer information he obtained
from his job as Pratt's nuclear expert to orchestrate purchases by Pratt from his co-conspirators who paid him kickbacks, knowing that his recommendations as to
cost and supplier would be adopted by his supervisors virtually without question.<a href="#N_9_"><sup>(9)</sup></a> 
And he deliberately concealed from Pratt his interest in the sale of surplus valves
to Pratt.  Thus, Triplett abused his position of trust to effectuate a scheme that
would not have been possible in the absence of his position and Pratt's trust.  And
in signing an affidavit denying that he received any kickbacks on these sales, he
helped ensure that his scheme would go undetected.  As this Court held in <u>United
States v. Liss</u>, 265 F.3d 1220, 1229 (11th Cir. 2001), an abuse of trust
enhancement properly applies if (l) the defendant is in a "position of trust with
respect to the victim of the crime," and (2) the position of trust "contributed in
some significant way to facilitating the commission or concealment of the offense"
(relying on <u>United States v. Garrison</u>, 133 F.3d 831, 837 (11th Cir. 1998)). 
"Significant facilitation" means that "the person in the position of trust has an
advantage in committing the crime because of that trust and uses that advantage in
order to commit the crime."  <u>United States v. Barakat</u>, 130 F.3d 1448, 1455 (11th
Cir. 1997).

<p>	These factors were clearly present here, as they were in <u>United States v.
Poirier</u>, 321 F.3d 1024 (11th Cir. 2003).  In that case, defendants were convicted
of corrupting the process by which Fulton County selected an underwriter for a
bond refunding project by bribing the County's financial advisor to help ensure
the award of the underwriting contract.  The Court held that, since the defendant
financial advisor was "hired to serve as a fair and unbiased . . . advisor," and the
victim "put him in a position to do that," "[w]ith that position came . . .  trust, and
[defendant] clearly abused it."  The abuse of trust enhancement was therefore
warranted.  <u>Id.</u> at 1033.<a href="#N_10_"><sup>(10)</sup></a>

<p>	In contrast to <u>Poirier</u>, the cases on which Triplett relies &#151; <u>Garrison</u> and
<u>United States v. Broderson</u>, 67 F.3d 452 (2d Cir. 1995) &#151; do not involve a
defendant who occupied a position of trust with respect to the victim.  <u>Garrison</u>,
133 F.3d at 837 (Garrison was a home care nursing provider that defrauded
Medicare); <u>Broderson</u>, 67 F.3d at 456 (Broderson was a Grumman Data Systems
Corp. executive who submitted false documents to the government).  <u>Garrison</u>
stated, however, that &#167;3B1.3 <u>would properly be applied</u> "where the defendant
steals from his employer, using his position in the company to facilitate the
offense," or "where a 'fiduciary or personal trust relationship exists' . . . and the
defendant takes advantage of the relationship to perpetrate or conceal the offense."
133 F.3d at 837-38 (citations omitted); also 133 F.3d at 839 (abuse of trust
enhancement applies "where the <em>defendant has abused discretionary authority
entrusted to the defendant by the victim,</em>" distinguishing "arm's-length business
relationships" (emphasis in original), citing <u>United States v. Jolly</u>, 102 F.3d 46, 48
(2d Cir. 1996)); <u>accord</u>, <u>Broderson</u>, 67 F.3d at 456 (abuse of trust would be
warranted if the defendant had accepted bribes to defraud his employer).<a href="#N_11_"><sup>(11)</sup></a>  That is
exactly what Triplett did in this case.  Accordingly, the district court correctly
applied the abuse of trust enhancement.

<p>	B.  Triplett is also wrong in claiming that an abuse of trust is included in the
base offense level or specific offense characteristic for his honest services fraud. 
Def. Br. 9.  In <u>United States v. Buck</u>, 324 F.3d 786, 792-793 (5th Cir. 2003), the
Fifth Circuit explained that the fraud guidelines set the offense level for a "breach"
of a duty of honest service, but do not take into consideration the more serious
offense considered in &#167;3B1.3 which is an "abuse" of that duty to effectuate or
conceal a crime.  Thus, the courts distinguish between a "breach of trust" and an
"abuse of trust, which requires more egregious conduct."  324 F.3d at 792-93.

<p>	Moreover, the fallacy of Triplett's claim is evident by comparing the fraud
guidelines in Chapter Two, Part F, under which Triplett was sentenced, to
numerous other offenses in Chapter Two that specifically contain the proviso: 
"Do not apply &#167; 3B1.3" -- because abuse of trust <u>has</u> already been considered in
formulating the offense level for those crimes.<a href="#N_12_"><sup>(12)</sup></a>  Thus, when the Sentencing
Commission meant to exclude application of &#167;3B1.3 for a particular offense, it
knew how to say so.  No similar prohibition against application of &#167;3B1.3 exists
for any &#167;2F1.1 offenses, and for good reason: &#167;2F1.1 offenses do not take <u>abuse</u> of
trust into account in calculating the base level. 

<p>	Thus, the critical question is not whether the defendant's conduct in
committing "honest services fraud" is the same conduct on which an abuse of trust
enhancement is based (Def. Br. 11), but, rather, whether that conduct contains the
aggravating factors &#151; the use of a position of trust to facilitate or conceal the
commission of a crime &#151; that warrant a &#167;3B1.3 enhancement.  Here the
aggravating factors were present and the district court correctly applied an abuse
of trust enhancement.

<p><a name="6ii"></a><ol type="I" start="2"><li>THE DISTRICT COURT PROPERLY APPLIED A FOUR-LEVEL
ENHANCEMENT FOR TRIPLETT'S ROLE IN THE OFFENSE</ol>


<p>	The district court properly applied a four-level enhancement under USSG
&#167;3B1.1(a) because Triplett was both the organizer and leader of a criminal activity
that involved five or more participants.  R121: 19.  The district court's finding that
the conspiracy involved more than five participants &#151; Jimmy and Ted Scruggs,
their mother Elaine Scruggs (the Scruggs bookkeeper who processed all of the
paperwork involved in the fraudulent transactions, had the bank make wire
transfers to Triplett's account, and mailed a kickback check to Triplett), Chris
Mealey and Pam Wayhan of Eurotech, and Triplett himself (R121:19) &#151; is not
clearly erroneous.<a href="#N_13_"><sup>(13)</sup></a>

<p>	Triplett does not deny his role as leader or organizer:  he originated the
scheme, he recruited the Scruggs company and directed Jimmy Scruggs to find a
front company to sell the parts to Pratt at the significantly inflated prices that he
determined; he also initiated related schemes to buy and sell parts to Pratt or Pratt
customers that deprived Pratt of profits and yielded Triplett kickbacks on those
sales.

<p>	Indeed, Triplett only challenges the inclusion of Mealey and Wayhan.  He
claims that they cannot be counted as participants because they "denied all
criminal culpability," they did not know that a Pratt employee was receiving
kickbacks as part of the scheme, and they could not be held to have knowledge
that they were aiding a scheme to deprive Pratt of money or property.  Def. Br. 13-14.  These claims are false and/or legally irrelevant.

<p>	First, neither Mealey nor Wayhan "denied all criminal culpability."<a href="#N_14_"><sup>(14)</sup></a> 
Indeed, Mealey pleaded Eurotech guilty to the charged conspiracy of defrauding
Pratt, understanding that his company was guilty of a crime, and that it could be
assessed a sizeable fine and ordered to pay restitution.  R117:13-14, 21; GX 550. 
Mealey and Wayhan were both testifying pursuant to Eurotech's plea agreement. 
R117:14; R118:16; GX 550.

<p>	Second, whether or not they knew of Triplett's involvement in the scheme is
irrelevant.  Mealey and Wayhan knew of the scheme to defraud Pratt and
knowingly acted to further it.  That is all that is necessary to hold a participant
liable for conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. &#167;371.  "[A] common scheme or plan may be
inferred from the conduct of the participants or from other circumstances.  The
government is not required to prove that a defendant knew every detail or that he
participated in every stage of the conspiracy."  <u>United States v. Diaz</u>, 190 F.3d
1247, 1254 (11th Cir. 1999).  "A [person] may be found guilty of conspiracy if the
evidence demonstrates that he knew the 'essential objective' of the conspiracy,
even if he did not know all its details or played only a minor role in the overall
scheme."  <u>United States v. Guerra</u>, 293 F.3d 1279, 1285 (11th Cir. 2002).

<p>	Mealey and Wayhan knew the essential objective of the conspiracy &#151; to
disguise the true source of the valves so that Pratt would pay higher prices.  They
knew that Scruggs was a Pratt distributor, that Scruggs wanted Eurotech to front
the sales of the valves actually owned by Scruggs by shipping them to Pratt and
billing them in Eurotech's name.  R117:7-10.  Mealey agreed to participate in the
scheme and, with the help of his sister-in-law, Pam Wayhan, who "ran the office []
did the paperwork, accounts payable, receivable . . . everything," they carried it
out.  R117:11; R118:3.  Mealey told Wayhan they would be receiving valves from
Scruggs that would be shipped to Pratt and invoiced in Eurotech's name.  Wayhan
knew that the valves did not belong to Eurotech but that they were simply doing "a
favor" for Scruggs, for which they retained five percent of the sales price before
forwarding Pratt's payments to Scruggs.  R118:4-8.  Scruggs told Wayhan what
valves to ship, what price to charge, and that a purchase order would be
forthcoming from Pratt.  R118:6.  Wayhan then prepared the invoices, knowing
that they contained "incorrect" information about the name of the seller of the
valves.  R117:17 ("<u>except for the issue of the name</u>," information was not
"incorrect") (emphasis added).  Eurotech never had any ownership interest in the
valves, although Mealey and Wayhan purported to "sell" them to Pratt.  R117:12;
R118: 5. 

<p>	Mealey and Wayhan were thus participants in a scheme to defraud Pratt. 
They did not have to know that Triplett was involved in the scheme, or know
whether any of the participants had a "fiduciary interest" with Pratt.  They
certainly knew that their transactions were not "above board."  <u>See</u> Def. Br. 14. 
They knew that by mailing false invoices they were abetting a plan to deceive
Pratt as to the source of the valves so that Pratt would pay inflated prices, allowing
them to profit along with others.  With Mealey and Wayhan the scheme had more
than five participants and &#167;3B1.1(a) was properly applied.

<p>	In addition to the six participants specifically named by the district court,
there are other participants that can be counted under &#167;3B1.1(a).  As the
Introductory Commentary to Chapter Three, Part B - Role in the Offense indicates,
"[t]he determination of a defendant's role in the offense is to be made on the basis
of all conduct within the scope of &#167;1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) . . . and not solely
on the basis of elements and acts cited in the count of conviction."  Thus, offenses
that "were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the
offense of conviction," <em>i.e.</em>, offenses connected by a "common factor, such as
common victims, . . .  common purpose, or similar <u>modus operandi</u>," are to be
included in determining Chapter Three adjustments.  USSG &#167;1B1.3(a)(2), and
Application Notes 9(A),(B).  Because Triplett recruited Kathy Cain of ECI, Frank
Goodman of IV, and Jimmy Matheson of H * E, to pay him kickbacks in similar,
uncharged, schemes between 1994 and 1998 that deprived Pratt of money and
honest services (<u>see</u> <u>infra</u> pp. 34-43), these individuals are also appropriately
counted under &#167;3B1.1 as "participants" in the criminal activity organized and led
by Triplett.<a href="#N_15_"><sup>(15)</sup></a>

<p>	On these facts, the four-level enhancement under &#167;3B1.1(a) was required.

<p><a name="6iii"></a><ol type="I" start="3"><li>THE DISTRICT COURT DID NOT ERR IN CALCULATING LOSS
UNDER USSG &#167;2F1.1 OR IN ORDERING RESTITUTION FOR
THE VICTIM'S LOSS</ol>


<p>	Triplett claims that, although he knowingly violated the standards of
conduct governing his employment and put over $100,000 in his own pocket that
should have and would have gone to his employer, the district court improperly
increased his sentence under USSG &#167;2F1.1(b)(1) because "Pratt did not . . . sustain
any loss."  Def. Br. 16, 14-21.  However, the court did not calculate the increase in
offense level based on Pratt's losses, but on the more than $200,000 in gain to
Triplett and his co-conspirators from the scheme &#151; a value that Triplett does not
challenge.  Moreover, Pratt did sustain substantial losses.

<p>	A.  USSG &#167;2F1.1(b)(1) provides for an eight-level increase for a loss of
more than $200,000.  Application Note 7 to the guideline provides that "[a]s in
theft cases, <u>loss is the value of the money, property, or services unlawfully taken</u>"
(emphasis added).  Similarly, Application Note 8 provides that "[f]or the purposes
of subsection (b)(1), . . . . <u>[t]he offender's gain from committing the fraud is an
alternative estimate</u> . . . . " (emphasis added).  In this case, the district court
calculated the loss based on the offenders' gain.  R121:38-46, 39 ("In fact, I'm
going to give him the benefit of the doubt and say, I'll do it on what he actually
received").  Triplett conceded that the offenders' gain amounted to more than
$200,000 on the sales at issue.  R121:39-40 ("I have no quibble with the figures"
or the court's "arithmetic calculation").  Therefore, the district court properly
increased the offense level by eight, using the money taken by Triplett and his co-conspirators as an approximation of Pratt's true loss.

<p>	In <u>United States v. Yeager</u>, 331 F.3d 1216, 1224 (11th Cir. 2003), this Court
upheld a &#167;2F1.1(b)(1) enhancement based on defendant's gain, and rejected
defendant's contentions that the court did not and could not find that the victim
suffered a loss from his fraudulent conduct.  Misrepresenting himself as a mail
order pharmacy, defendant drug distributor obtained drugs at a low price offered
under a special contract with the manufacturer, promising to sell the drugs only to
specific customers.  Defendant, however, diverted sales to distributors who resold
the drugs at a market advantage, effectively undercutting the manufacturer's
distribution scheme.  331 F.3d at 1219.  This Court rejected Yeager's claim that
the manufacturer made a substantial profit from its relationship with Yeager and
therefore there was no "loss" to be considered in sentencing.  331 F.3d at 1224-25. 
The Court held that the defendant's "theft" of distribution privileges, converting a
restrictive distribution license into an unrestricted license, caused an actual loss to
the manufacturer.  And it was not clear error for the district court to accept the
profit defendant made from the unrestricted sales as a reasonable estimate of that
loss.

<p>	In <u>United States v. Parrish</u>, 84 F.3d 816 (6th Cir. 1996), the court held that a
fraud calculation was properly based on $362,000 paid to defendant as
"commissions" by an outside printing service in exchange for defendant's
recommendation that her employer use that printing service.  Although there was
no evidence that the employer paid higher prices than it otherwise would have for
the printing services, the court held that, by not telling the employer of the
"commissions" and arrangement, the defendant breached a fiduciary duty and, had
the employer known of the arrangement, it either could have taken the kickbacks
for itself or tried to negotiate a lower price for the printing service.  "Under either
scenario, [defendant's] fraud resulted in a loss to [her employer]."  84 F.3d at 819.

<p>	<u>Yeager</u> and <u>Parrish</u> demonstrate that schemes like Triplett's &#151; whereby an
employee takes illegal "commissions" in exchange for steering business toward a
supplier, or whereby a defendant fraudulently diverts sales from the victim to
himself &#151; causes a loss to the victim that can be calculated under &#167;2F1.1(b)(1)
based on defendant's gain from the fraud.

<p>	B.  Even if we ignored the guideline commentary authorizing a loss
calculation based on defendant's gain, Pratt did in fact sustain a loss.  Triplett's
claim of "no loss" to his victim has three alternative, but equally fallacious, bases: 
(l) because Pratt resold all the valves at a profit, it could not have "lost money;"
(2) because Pratt sought an 85% profit margin on every sale, it made more money
on higher priced valves than lower priced valves, and hence made "more money"
as a result of Triplett's fraud; and (3) even if Pratt did make less profit, lost profits
are "intangibles" that cannot be considered "losses" to a victim.

<p>	With respect to the first claim, whether or not Pratt resold the valves
acquired from Eurotech at a loss is irrelevant.  Triplett diverted to his own pocket
profits on those sales that would have and should have gone to Pratt.  In at least
three other cases, moreover, Triplett and Scruggs sold valves and related items
directly to Pratt's customers, earning more than $22,000 in profits, while depriving
Pratt of any profit at all on the sales &#151; profits that should have and would have
gone to Pratt but for Triplett's misuse of confidential customer information and
fraud on his employer.  GX 141-145; <u>see</u> <u>supra</u> pp. 10-11.  All of these losses are
properly considered under a &#167;2F1.1 adjustment.  <u>Parrish</u>; <u>Yeager</u>, 331 F.3d at 1226
(diverted profits are "not merely an opportunity-cost loss but rather [are] definite
losses for which sentencing adjustments are appropriate").

<p>	The cases on which Triplett relies (Def. Br. 15-18) do not call for a different
result.  In <u>United States v. Khan</u>, 969 F.2d 218 (6th Cir. 1992), no money was
"taken" by the defendant, so there was no loss.<a href="#N_16_"><sup>(16)</sup></a>  <u>United States v. Wilson</u>, 993
F.2d 214, 217 (11th Cir. 1993), held that, although "incidental or consequential
injury" could not be included in the fraud loss calculation, "the value of the
property taken . . . is an indicator of both the harm to the victim and the gain to the
defendant" for purposes of the fraud enhancement (quoting the sentencing
guidelines).  In the remaining cases on which Triplett relies, the courts found that
the district court had erred in its method of calculating the loss, but not in the fact
of loss itself.<a href="#N_17_"><sup>(17)</sup></a>  Here, Triplett conceded that the district court's loss <u>calculations</u>
were correct.  R121:39-40.

<p>	Triplett's second argument &#151; that his scheme in fact earned Pratt "more
money" for Pratt because the more Pratt paid for a valve the more profit it made
(Def. Br. 18-20) &#151;  ignores the record.  While Pratt's <u>targeted</u> profit levels were
85%, the profits Pratt realized on the valves at issue here were significantly less
<u>because</u> of the inflated cost of the valves, coupled with market constraints that
limited the price Pratt could charge its customers for refurbished valves. 
R116:116.  For example, in one case Pratt had followed Triplett's recommendation
to pay $14,000 for a "Eurotech" valve and resell the valve to the customer (after
being refurbished at a cost of about $4,600), for $24,550.  This yielded a 24.24%
profit, not an 85% profit.  Had Pratt paid what the record showed to be a
reasonable price for the valve, Pratt would have made a 77.2% profit on the same
sale, and earned $13,000 more.  GX 37 and <u>supra</u> note 4.<a href="#N_18_"><sup>(18)</sup></a>  This was an "economic
loss" to Pratt.  And for this reason, it is not "illogical" (Def. Br. 20), but entirely
sensible that, as Polito testified at trial, Pratt sought to purchase surplus valves at
the lowest possible cost.  <u>See</u> <u>supra</u> p. 4.

<p>	In fact, Triplett's counsel conceded in closing argument that Pratt lost
profits as a result of his scheme.  R125:532 (in absence of scheme, Pratt was "just
going to get [valves] at a lower price to make even more money, to make even
more money"), also R125:541.  Triplett argued to the jury, however, (as he argues
here), that for merely depriving Pratt of "even more money," he should not be
found guilty.  <u>Id.</u>  The jury, correctly applying the law and using its common sense
to view the facts, rejected this purported defense.

<p>	Despite Triplett's disingenuous assertions to the contrary, lost profits are
"losses" for which Pratt is entitled to reimbursement.  <u>Yeager</u>.  Triplett cites no
authority for his claims that lost profits are non-compensable, like "interest" on
money the defendant has taken or "intangible property interest[s]."  Def. Br. 21. 
To the contrary, "profits" are "income," and income is "a gain" that is usually
"measured in money."  <u>Webster's Third New International Dictionary</u> (unabr.) at
1811 (profit defined, <u>inter alia</u>, as "gain," "valuable return esp. in financial
matters," "the excess of returns over expenditure," "net income"); <u>id.</u> at 1143
(defining "income").  Lost profits, therefore, are compensable losses.

<p>	C.  Because the district court properly concluded that Pratt suffered a loss
attributable to Triplett's conduct, the court properly ordered restitution.  <u>Yeager</u>,
331 F.3d at 1227.  <u>United States v. Apex Roofing</u>, 49 F.3d 1509 (11th Cir. 1995),
relied on at Def. Br. 26, is irrelevant because there the Court concluded that,
unlike Pratt in this case, the victim had not sustained any loss.  And because
Triplett did not and does not challenge the amount of restitution, but only the
finding of loss (R121:47), the order of restitution should be affirmed.

<p><a name="6iv"></a><ol type="I" start="4"><li>THE DISTRICT COURT DID NOT CLEARLY ERR IN INCLUDING
RELEVANT CONDUCT IN CALCULATING THE OFFENSE LEVEL</ol>


<p>	The district court did not clearly err in including uncharged relevant
conduct (<u>see</u> <u>supra</u> pp. 11-12) when calculating the offense level.<a href="#N_19_"><sup>(19)</sup></a>

<p>	Under USSG &#167;1B1.3(a)(2), a "defendant may be held accountable at
sentencing for illegal conduct not in furtherance of the offence of conviction if
that conduct was 'part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan'
as the offense of conviction."  <u>United States v. Gomez</u>, 164 F.3d 1354, 1356 (11th
Cir. 1999), citing guideline.  "This Court broadly interprets the provisions of the
relevant conduct guideline."  <u>United States v. Behr</u>, 93 F.3d 764, 765 (11th Cir.
1996).  Thus, when a district court finds "that [conduct not constituting the offense
of conviction] was 'part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or
plan'" the offense level "would have . . . to" be based on that conduct as well as
the charged conduct.  <u>Edwards v. United States</u>, 523 U.S. 511, 514-15 (1998);
<u>United States v. Fuentes</u>, 107 F.3d 1515, 1523 (11th Cir. 1997) ("offense level
'<em>shall</em> be determined on the basis of' all relevant conduct") (emphasis in original,
quoting guideline).

<p>	"For two or more offenses to constitute part of a common scheme or plan,
they must be substantially connected to each other by at least one common factor,
such as common victims, common accomplices, common purpose, or similar
<u>modus operandi</u>." &#167;1B1.3, comment. (n.9(A)).  Citing this commentary, this Court
held in <u>Fuentes</u>, 107 F.3d at 1525, that two of these common factors were present
and so the offenses constituted a common scheme, but it added that "<u>only one
[factor] is required</u>." (emphasis added.)  <u>Fuentes</u> also noted that offenses form the
same course of conduct if they are part of an "<em>ongoing series of offenses.</em>"  <u>Id.</u>
(emphasis in <u>Fuentes</u>), quoting comment. (n.9(B)).  "Factors . . . to be considered .
. . include the degree of similarity of the offenses, the regularity (repetitions) of the
offenses, and the time interval between the offenses."  Comment. (n.9(B)).  Thus,
in determining whether uncharged conduct is "relevant conduct" for purposes of
&#167;1B1.3, this Court "will evaluate the 'similarity, regularity, and temporal
proximity' between [defendant's] counts of conviction and the extrinsic []
offense."  <u>United States v. Maxwell</u>, 34 F.3d 1006, 1011 &amp; n.34 (11th Cir. 1994).

<p>	Three of the four factors enumerated in the guideline commentary are 
present in this case.  There was a common victim:  Pratt.  There was a  common
purpose:  to obtain kickbacks by depriving Pratt of sales and profits.  And there
was a similar <u>modus operandi</u>.  In each case Triplett was the architect and initiator
of  the conduct, and the method for obtaining the kickbacks was the same or
similar.  Thus, like his agreement with Scruggs, (1) Triplett arranged for Kathy
Cain of ECI to sell a valve to Pratt for $16,500 after telling her where she could
purchase the valve for $1,000 so that Triplett could take back half the $15,000
overcharge; (2) Triplett arranged for Frank Goodman of IV to sell parts to Pratt at
inflated prices, and Triplett took $21,400 in kickbacks on those sales; and (3)
Triplett arranged with Jimmy Matheson for H * E to buy three surplus Pratt valves
for $1,500 each, which Triplett then had H * E sell to Pratt for $13,500 each, and 
Triplett received half the profits in kickbacks.  <u>See</u> <u>supra</u> pp. 11-12.  And, like the
charged conspiracy with Scruggs where Scruggs sold some valves directly to Pratt
customers (<u>see</u> <u>supra</u> pp. 10-11), Triplett arranged for H * E to sell Pratt
equipment directly to a customer, receiving over $5,000 in kickbacks on the sale,
and depriving Pratt of the sale entirely.  GX 300, 350-59.<a href="#N_20_"><sup>(20)</sup></a>

<p>	In addition, there was a "similarity" between the charged and uncharged
conduct.  <u>Maxwell</u>, 34 F.3d at 1011.  There was also a "temporal proximity" and a
"regularity" with which Triplett initiated his fraudulent kickback schemes.  <u>Id.</u>. 
The charged conspiracy in this case began in January 1996 and continued at least
through May 1998. GX 9-25, 139-40.  The ECI transactions occurred from 1994
into at least December 15, 1995, when Triplett was still billing Cain for remaining
unpaid kickbacks.  GX 408.  <u>See</u> <u>United States v. Simpson</u>, 228 F.3d 1294, 1301-1302 (11th Cir. 2000) (schemes temporally connected where relevant conduct took
place in late 1995 and charged conduct in May-June of 1996).  The scheme with
IV took place in 1997 and into 1998 (GX 260), the same time that the conspiracy
with Scruggs was occurring.  And Triplett was receiving kickbacks from Jimmy
Matheson of H * E between May 30, 1995 and December 31, 1997 (GX 300, 350-359), from the time of the Cain conspiracy through the period covered by the
charged conspiracy.<a href="#N_21_"><sup>(21)</sup></a>

<p>	The district court did not clearly err, therefore, in finding that the uncharged
conduct was part of a common scheme by Triplett to obtain kickbacks and illegal
payments by diverting profits from Pratt.  The diverted profits were achieved
through overcharges to Pratt and diverted sales and profits that were similar to
those involved in the charged Triplett/Scruggs/Eurotech scheme; and the related
conduct occurred immediately before and, for the most part, during the time of the
offense of conviction.<a href="#N_22_"><sup>(22)</sup></a> 

<p>	Triplett's challenges to the inclusion of relevant conduct consist primarily
of conclusory allegations that lack legal foundation.  He first claims that because
the relevant conduct at issue is not the <u>same</u> offense (it has different participants,
consists of transactions that are different from those charged in this case, and is
even the subject of other indictments), it is therefore a "discreet [sic], identifiable
unit" that cannot be taken into account in sentencing.  Def. Br. 22.  If this were an
accurate interpretation of the guidelines and the cases, no relevant conduct could
be considered under &#167;1B1.3.  The Seventh Circuit specifically rejected such a
claim in <u>United States v. Petty</u>, 132 F.3d 373, 381 (7th Cir. 1997) ("to the extent
Petty argues that relevant conduct is only conduct that for some reason could not
have been separately charged . . .  he is simply incorrect."  The guidelines require
the courts to "take into account 'the full range of related conduct,' whether it be
charged or not").

<p>	The government need not claim that ECI, H * E, and IV were part of the
same single conspiracy charged in this indictment.  Rather, the premise of &#167;1B1.3
is that relevant conduct is <u>not the same</u> conduct, but conduct that is "sufficiently
connected or related to each other as to warrant the conclusion that they are part of
. . . <em>ongoing series of offenses.</em>" <u> Fuentes</u>, 107 F.3d at 1525.  The question is
whether the conduct constitutes "discrete, identifiable units' <u>apart from the offense
of conviction</u>."  <u>Maxwell</u>, 34 F.3d at 1010-11 (emphasis added).

<p>	Courts do not look to whether conduct is a "discrete, identifiable unit" to the
exclusion of the other relevant factors.  Nor do they use it to negate other factors
relevant in determining whether conduct is part of a "course of conduct" or
"ongoing series of offenses."<a href="#N_23_"><sup>(23)</sup></a>  When courts find uncharged conduct to be a
"discrete, identifiable unit," it is because the uncharged conduct is not sufficiently
similar to the charged conduct to be part of a common scheme.  <u>See</u> <u>Maxwell</u>, 34
F.3d at 1010-11 (conspiracy to distribute dilaudid distinct from cocaine
distribution scheme involving none of the same parties and temporally remote);
<u>United States v. Sykes</u>, 7 F.3d 1331, 1336-37 (7th Cir. 1993) (lack of "distinctive
similarities" and "[t]he lengthy time interval here tend[] to indicate conduct that
can easily be separated into 'discrete, identifiable units,' rather than behavior that
is part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan"); <u>United States
v. Pinnick,</u> 47 F.3d 434, 438 (D.C. Cir. 1995) ("[w]here the defendant's offense of
conviction and the acts offered as relevant conduct could be 'separately identified'
<u>and were of a different 'nature</u>,' we have found that the conduct was not part of the
same course of conduct") (emphasis added).  Indeed, in <u>United States v. Blanc</u>,
146 F.3d 847, 853-54 n.1 (11th Cir. 1998), relied on by Triplett (Def. Br. 24), the
Court evaluated the "similarity, regularity, and temporal proximity" of the
uncharged fraudulent conduct to the charged fraudulent conduct.  But the Court
concluded that, because the frauds were of a "wholly distinct nature," involving
different victims, different subject matter, none of the same parties, and a temporal
separation of a few years, they were "discrete, identifiable units <u>apart from the
offense of conviction</u>." <u>Id.</u> at 852, emphasis added.  In contrast, as discussed
above, the relevant conduct in Triplett's case was so similar and temporally related
as to be part of a common scheme or plan.

<p>	Indeed, conduct that could loosely be termed "discrete" by Triplett's
definition, because it could be charged as a separate count or a separate offense, is
routinely the kind of conduct that courts consider for purposes of relevant conduct,
as demonstrated even in the cases on which Triplett relies.  Def. Br. 22, citing
<u>United States v. Bethley</u>, 973 F.2d 396, 400-401 (5th Cir. 1992); <u>United States v.
Chatman</u>, 982 F.2d 292, 294 (8th Cir. 1992) (drug transactions that were subject of
state court charges were properly considered relevant conduct); <u>accord</u>, <u>e.g.</u>,
<u>Simpson</u>, 228 F.3d at 1302.

<p>	Triplett also claims, without any citation, that "if alleged relevant conduct is
not relevant to all conspirators, except purportedly one, then surely it . . . is not
relevant to any conspirator."  Def. Br. 23.  To the contrary, however, the
provisions of &#167;1B1.3 must be applied to each defendant individually, even when
all defendants are tried together.  <u>See</u> comment. (n.2) ("relevant conduct is not
necessarily the same for every participant").  For example, a defendant cannot be
held liable under the guidelines for conspiratorial acts done before he joined the
conspiracy. &#167;1B1.3, comment. (n.2).

<p>	An underlying assumption of the relevant conduct provisions is that all
defendants and all of the separate schemes will not be charged in one indictment,
and perhaps could not or should not be charged in one indictment.  <u>See</u> <u>Maxwell</u>,
34 F.3d at 1010 ("The [guideline] commentary . . . makes clear that relevant
conduct may include uncharged conduct," and conduct that "is not an element of
the offense of conviction").  Thus, it is irrelevant that the participants in the
various limited schemes that made up Triplett's overall common plan to defraud
his employer could not themselves be held accountable for all of the conduct
charged to Triplett.<a href="#N_24_"><sup>(24)</sup></a>  Minor participants in a broad conspiracy or plan are subject
to different evaluation and treatment under the sentencing guidelines.  Triplett
forgets that the sentencing court knew it would be improper to hold another
defendant accountable for conduct that was neither known to him nor reasonably
foreseeable.  <u>See</u> R121:36.  Neither IV, Matheson, nor Eurotech could be
chargeable under the guidelines for Triplett's wrongdoing with the others because
they did not know and could not reasonably foresee that Triplett was engaging in
similar activity with many others.  USSG &#167;1B1.3(a)(l) and comment. (n.2).<a href="#N_25_"><sup>(25)</sup></a>

<p>	Because the relevant conduct meets the criteria established in the guideline
commentary and the factors that this Court considers under the guidelines, the
district court did not clearly err in including that conduct in its guidelines
calculations.

<p><a name="6v"></a><ol type="I" start="5"><li>THE COURT PROPERLY APPLIED AN ENHANCEMENT FOR
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE</ol>


<p>	The court properly applied a two-level enhancement because Triplett
"willfully obstructed or impeded" and "attempted to obstruct or impede, the
administration of justice during the investigation [and] prosecution . . . of the
instant offense." USSG &#167;3C1.1 

<p>	Triplett admitted during his cross-examination at trial that he destroyed
documents concerning his dealings with the Scruggs Company after he knew he
was under investigation for taking illegal kickbacks.  R124:448-450; 367-68; GX
148, pp. 1-2 (tape recording of conversation with Jimmy Scruggs).<a href="#N_26_"><sup>(26)</sup></a>  This, by
itself, required a two-level enhancement under &#167;3C1.1, comment. (n.3(d))
(destroying material evidence).

<p>	In addition, the trial court properly concluded, after hearing Triplett's taped
telephone conversations with Jimmy Scruggs and reviewing the transcript of Jerry
Wickliffe's grand jury testimony, that Triplett had encouraged these potential
witnesses to cover up the conspiracy.  R121:22-28.<a href="#N_27_"><sup>(27)</sup></a>  Although Triplett purports
not to understand "what 'conversations' and 'witnesses' the court was referring"
to when it made this finding (Def. Br. 28 n.12), the sentencing record establishes
that defense counsel fully understood that the conversations and witnesses referred
to were Jerry Wickliffe and Jimmy Scruggs.  R121:21-26.  Both conversations
occurred after the FBI's December 15, 1998 visit to Triplett's home &#151; a visit that
prompted Triplett's concern that his schemes with Pratt might be uncovered. 
Wickliffe at 109-111;<a href="#N_28_"><sup>(28)</sup></a> GX 148 at 1-2; R123:192-202; R124:363-64 (FBI
questioned Triplett about ECI kickbacks).  Thus, Triplett's claim that the timing of
these conversations was "unclear" (Def. Br. 28 n.12) is also false.  

<p>	Triplett's only objection to the obstruction enhancement is one that was
never raised below (<u>see</u> R121:21-22), and cannot serve as a basis for reversal in
the absence of plain error.  He belatedly claims that the document destruction
referred to in his conversation with Jimmy Scruggs after the FBI visited his home,
did not occur "during the course of the investigation . . . of the instant offense." 
Def. Br. 29-30.  The only basis for this contention is that the agent did not ask any
questions about Eurotech and Scruggs at that interview, "which no doubt he would
have, had the Government at that time been investigating the instant matter."  <u>Id.</u>
at 29.

<p>	The fact that in December 1998, the FBI did not ask Triplett about his
dealings with the Scruggs brothers does not negate the fact that the interview was
part of an investigation into the conduct with which Triplett was ultimately
charged.  In the early stages of an investigation the government does not of course
have all &#151; or even many &#151; facts.  The obstruction guidelines, quite properly, do not
require that obstruction occur at any particular stage of an investigation and,
indeed, as is demonstrated by the facts here, obstruction may occur (and might be
more egregious) at early stages of an investigation before the government has
gathered significant information and when potential defendants have the most to
gain by destroying evidence before it can be uncovered.<a href="#N_29_"><sup>(29)</sup></a>

<p>	The documents that Triplett destroyed included the sheet listing the valves
that he and Scruggs had purchased and proposed to sell to Pratt.  The fact that
Triplett destroyed a document that is at the very heart of this case as a result of the
FBI interview strongly suggests that he knew the investigation concerned this
conduct, or would lead to uncovering this conduct, and that he wanted to prevent
the investigators from discovering his fraud.  It was precisely because Triplett
hoped the FBI did not yet have this information that he took steps to destroy the 
evidence that could lead to the detection of the scheme and his conviction.<a href="#N_30_"><sup>(30)</sup></a>  This
is a classic example of conduct that warrants an obstruction enhancement.  

<p>	The district court's factual findings are not clearly erroneous, and there was
no plain error in imposing an obstruction of justice enhancement.<a href="#N_31_"><sup>(31)</sup></a>

<p><a name="6vi"></a><ol type="I" start="6"><li>THERE WAS NO CONSTRUCTIVE AMENDMENT OF THE
INDICTMENT</ol>


<p>	Contrary to Triplett's claim (Def. Br. 30-34), the essential elements of the
offense charged in the indictment were not broadened at trial.

<p>  	A constructive amendment of an indictment "occurs when the essential
elements of the offense contained in the indictment are altered to broaden the
possible bases for conviction."  <u>United States v. Castro</u>, 89 F.3d 1443, 1452-53
(11th Cir. 1996), quoting <u>United States v. Keller</u>, 916 F.2d 628, 634 (11th Cir.
1990).  The government does not have to set forth all of its evidence in the
indictment.  <u>United States v. Williams</u>, 334 F.3d 1228, 1231-32 (11th Cir. 2003).<a href="#N_32_"><sup>(32)</sup></a> 
And a constructive amendment does not occur simply because the government
relies on acts at trial that were not listed in the overt acts section of the indictment. 
<u>United States v. Gold</u>, 743 F.2d 800, 813 (11th Cir. 1984).  <u>See also</u> <u>United States
v. Flynt</u>, 15 F.3d 1002, 1005-07 (11th Cir. 1994).<a href="#N_33_"><sup>(33)</sup></a>

<p>	Triplett's claim that the government amended the indictment at trial by
arguing that he had defrauded Pratt of "profits" ignores the express language of
the indictment.  The indictment charged that Triplett conspired to "obtain money
from . . . Pratt . . ."   Evidence that Triplett deprived Pratt of profits was used to
prove that charge, <em>i.e.,</em> Triplett obtained money from Pratt by diverting profits
from Pratt to himself.  Proof of facts that, although not mentioned in the
indictment, "are entirely consistent with its allegations," is not a basis for reversal. 
<u>Gold</u>, 743 F.2d at 813.  Thus, a discussion of lost profits did not amend the
indictment.

<p>	Similarly, Triplett mistakenly claims that the government amended the
indictment by introducing and relying on evidence that he concealed from Pratt the
fact that Scruggs paid an average price of $175 each for the valves.  Such evidence
was not an element of the offense or a material fact that had to be included in the
indictment.  But the fact that the valve sold to Pratt for $14,000 was one of the
valves that Scruggs bought for an average price of $175 was relevant to undermine
Triplett's claims that Pratt did not suffer any economic harm from his taking
kickbacks.  Over the government's objection (R34), the court permitted Triplett to
show that Pratt made a profit on every sale.  Triplett used that evidence to argue
throughout trial (as he does in this appeal) that, since Pratt <u>made a profit</u>, it was
not economically harmed by Triplett's scheme.  To rebut that claim, the
government rightly sought to show that Pratt indeed <u>lost substantial profits</u> by
paying exorbitant overcharges for the Scruggs valves, thus depriving Pratt of
profits that were directly diverted to Triplett and Scruggs.<a href="#N_34_"><sup>(34)</sup></a>  The only objection
Triplett raised at that time was that the evidence exceeded the scope of his cross-examination of Nick Polito and should have been offered during the government's
direct case.  R116:103-106.  This evidence did not amend the indictment or
broaden the basis for conviction.  Rather, this evidence was relevant to rebut
Triplett's factually false defense that, notwithstanding his fraud, Pratt had not
suffered any economic harm.

<p>	Triplett's mistaken use of terms of art such as "right" and "material fact"
(Def. Br. 32-34) &#151; words that the government never used and that the court never
charged in reference to Pratt's lost profits &#151; cannot transform accurate
observations concerning relevant evidence into an amendment of the indictment.<a href="#N_35_"><sup>(35)</sup></a> 
The indictment states (R1:5-6):

<p>	<blockquote>The Henry Pratt Company had a right to rely on DEFENDANT
TRIPLETT to conduct his work on the company's behalf in an honest
fashion so as to benefit his employer, including his work in securing
equipment at the best possible price for resale by the company.  The
Henry Pratt Company employees were prohibited from taking 
kickbacks from customers, suppliers or potential suppliers in return
for favorable treatment . . . . Instead of acting to obtain the best
possible prices for purchases by the Henry Pratt Company,
DEFENDANT TRIPLETT arranged for the Henry Pratt Company to
buy, at inflated prices, certain surplus equipment obtained by
[Scruggs] so the DEFENDANT TRIPLETT could receive kickbacks
from [Scruggs] based on its profits from the equipment sales.</blockquote>


<p>	The government's proof and argument about which Triplett complains
plainly track the indictment.  As an employee of Pratt, Triplett was obligated to
buy items for it at the cheapest prices and not take kickbacks.  Triplett's fraud
deprived Pratt of Triplett's honest services and money that belonged to Pratt, not
Triplett.  Pratt made less money because Triplett took money that belonged to it.

<p>	More important, Triplett cannot show prejudice or legal error from the
government's introduction of and reliance on the evidence concerning the price
Scruggs paid for the valves.  Triplett has not challenged any portion of the court's
charge, and does not dispute that the court correctly instructed the jury that the
government was required to prove the crimes and elements <u>as charged in the
indictment</u> beyond a reasonable doubt.  Specifically, the court repeatedly
instructed the jury as to what the "[i]ndictment charges," R120:7, 8, 11, 16, 23,
including the "means or methods" by which the conspiracy was alleged to have
been carried out. R120:24.  The court told the jury (emphasis added) that it must
find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed "<u>the acts charged in
the Indictment</u>," (R120:22) and that "[e]ach juror must agree with each of the other
jurors . . . that the same means or method <u>alleged in the Indictment</u> was, in fact,
engaged in or employed by the defendant in committing the crime <u>charged in the
Indictment</u>."  R120:25.  The court finally cautioned, once again, that "you are here
to determine from the evidence in the case whether the defendant's guilty or not
guilty, and the defendant is on trial <u>only for the specific offense alleged in the
Indictment</u>."  <u>Id.</u> (all of above emphasis added.)<u></u>

<p>Reviewing the government's actual statements (rather than Triplett's
characterization of them), the district court's instructions, and the evidence
proffered at trial in context, the jury could not have convicted Triplett on a charge
not contained in the indictment.  <u>See</u> <u>Castro</u>, 89 F.3d at 1453.

<p>	The conviction and sentence should be affirmed.

<p>	Respectfully submitted.

<p align="center"><b>FOOTNOTES</b>
<p>


<p><a name="N_1_">1. </a>  All cites are to the docket number in the clerk's record, followed by the
page number(s).
<p><a name="N_2_">2. </a>  Nuclear valves control the flow of water in the cooling towers.  They
range in size from three inches in diameter, weighing 300-400 pounds, to 48
inches in diameter, weighing up to four tons or more.  R116: 28.
<p><a name="N_3_">3. </a>  Pratt incurred much larger overhead costs in manufacturing nuclear
products and its target gross profit margins were significantly higher on those
products as a result.  R116:116-17.
<p><a name="N_4_">4. </a>  For example, Triplett and his co-conspirators charged Pratt $14,000 for a
valve that Pratt then refurbished for an additional cost of $4,597.71.  Pratt sold the
valve to Duke Power Company for $24,550, yielding what was, for Pratt, an
"extremely low" gross profit of 24.24%.  R116:106-118; R123:163.  Had Pratt
purchased the valve at what the evidence showed to be a reasonable price of
$1,000, Pratt would have saved $13,000 in costs and obtained a gross profit of
77.2% on the $24,550 sales price.  R116:114-115; GX 37.
<p><a name="N_5_">5. </a>  Scruggs was a Pratt distributor, as well as a commissioned agent.  For a
period of time, Pratt had suspended Scruggs as a commissioned agent (although
Scruggs remained a distributor).  Scruggs was reinstated as a commissioned agent
in 1996.  R123:141-44, 204-206; R116:58.  Triplett and Jimmy Scruggs believed
that some people at Pratt did not like Scruggs.  R123:158; R124:403.
<p><a name="N_6_">6. </a>  The "actuator" opens and closes the valve.  R124:388.
<p><a name="N_7_">7. </a>  An "operator" is the same as an actuator.  <u>See</u> <u>supra</u> note 6; R124:294.
<p><a name="N_8_">8. </a>  The 1997 Guidelines were used in sentencing.
<p><a name="N_9_">9. </a>  That Triplett did not have final decision making authority is not
determinative on the question whether he had a position of trust and abused it. 
<u>Poirier</u>, 321 F.3d at 1033.  He did exercise "substantial discretionary judgment that
[wa]s ordinarily given considerable deference."  USSG &#167;3B1.3 comment. (n.1).
<p><a name="N_10_">10. </a>  In the district court, Triplett claimed that <u>Poirier</u> was distinguishable
because in <u>Poirier</u> the jury had not reached a verdict as to whether defendants had
deprived their employers of the "right to honest services," having convicted only
for "money or property" fraud.  This attempt to distinguish <u>Poirier</u> is unavailing,
however, because the availability of &#167;3B1.3 depends not on the elements of the
offense of conviction but on whether abuse of trust is already taken into account in
the relevant guideline, here &#167;2F1.1.  The offense level for fraud is calculated the
same way for honest services fraud as it is for money and property fraud.
<p><a name="N_11_">11. </a>  As the Fifth Circuit pointed out in <u>United States v. Buck</u>, 324 F.3d 786,
793 &amp; n.13 (5th Cir. 2003), both this Circuit and the Second Circuit have affirmed
abuse of trust enhancements for fraud convictions in cases decided after
<u>Broderson</u>, and <u>Garrison</u><u></u>, citing <u>Liss</u>.
<p><a name="N_12_">12. </a>  <u>See</u> Application Note 3 to &#167;&#167;2A3.1(b)(3), 2A3.2(b)(1); Note 4 to
&#167;2A3.4(b)(3) (sex offenses involving a defendant who is victim's custodian or
care giver); Note 3 to &#167;2C1.1 (bribery involving public official); Note 1 to &#167;2C1.5
(payments to obtain public office); Note 4 to &#167;2C1.7 (frauds by public officials);
Note 5 to &#167;2E5.1(b)(1) (bribes involving employee welfare or pension plans);
Note 1 to &#167;2F1.2 (insider trading offenses); Note 6 to &#167;2G1.1(b)(3) and Note 3 to
&#167;2G2.1(b)(2) (promotion of prostitution or sexual exploitation by a parent or
guardian); Note 5 to &#167;2H1.1(b)(1) (civil rights violation by a public official); and
Note 3 to &#167;2P1.1(b)(4) (assistance by law enforcement official in escape from a
correctional institution).
<p><a name="N_13_">13. </a>  Alternatively, the government had argued that a four-level enhancement
was required because Triplett was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that
was "otherwise extensive." USSG &#167;3B1.1(a).  Because the court found "five or
more participants," it did not reach this alternative ground.
<p><a name="N_14_">14. </a>  Mealey and Wayhan testified on cross-examination that, at the time of the
activity, they did not know they were committing any crime.  R117:18-19;
R118:17.  Ignorance of the law, however, is not a defense to criminal liability.
<p><a name="N_15_">15. </a>  Two corporations &#151; Scruggs and Eurotech &#151; were also involved in the
conspiracy and could be counted as "participants" in the offense.  Application
Note 1 to &#167;3B1.1 defines a "participant" as a "person who is criminally
responsible for the commission of the offense," and the term "person" generally
refers to both individuals and collective entities such as corporations.  <u>See</u>, <u>e.g.</u>,
USSG &#167;8A1.1,<u></u> comment. (n.1); 18 U.S.C. &#167;18; 18 U.S.C. &#167;2510(6); 18 U.S.C.
&#167;224(c)(3).  To the extent that <u>United States v. Gross</u>, 26 F.3d 552 (5th Cir. 1994),
suggests otherwise, the decision is inconsistent with the plain language of the
guidelines.
<p><a name="N_16_">16. </a>  <u>Khan</u> noted that it had before it "the rare case where, in the face of
complete success, the fraud generated no loss" because, although the defendant
attempted to defraud the Social Security Administration of money by filing a false
death claim, no money was paid out to defendant because he had not worked the
required number of quarters to qualify for survivor benefits.  969 F.2d at 219-20.
<p><a name="N_17_">17. </a>  <u>United States v. Smith</u>, 951 F.2d 1164, 1167 (10th Cir. 1991), held that
the proper measure of loss is the "net" value of what was taken; <u>United States v.
Tatum</u>, 138 F.3d 1344 (11th Cir. 1998), held that the district court failed properly
to apply Application Note 7(b), which applies to "Fraudulent Loan Application
and Contract Procurement Cases" (frauds irrelevant to Triplett here), because the
calculation of loss was based on gross amount of monies paid on the contract,
without deducting for benefits received;  <u>United States v. Schneider</u>, 930 F.2d 555,
557 (7th Cir. 1991), held that the amount bid for a contract procured by fraud and
rescinded before any money is paid on the contract is not the proper measure of
loss, but did not hold that no loss was suffered; <u>United States v. Renick</u>, 273 F.3d
1009, 1025, 1028 (11th Cir. 2001), affirmed that part of a loss calculation that was
shown to be money paid out to defendant as part of a fraudulent medicare scheme.
<p><a name="N_18_">18. </a>  GX 37 was used as an example of one sale at trial.  Triplett did not rebut
the government's evidence with respect to lost profits on GX 37 or attempt to
show that any other sale yielded Pratt any greater profits.
<p><a name="N_19_">19. </a>  Virtually all the relevant conduct evidence had been introduced under
Fed. R. Evid. 404(b) at trial.
<p><a name="N_20_">20. </a>  In similar arrangements with Cain and Matheson, Triplett provided for
ECI and H * E to get illegal "discounts" on purchases they made from Pratt, and
then took back half the discounts in kickbacks.  <u>See</u> <u>supra</u> pp. 11-12.
<p><a name="N_21_">21. </a>  ECI kickbacks totaled $25,969; IV totaled $21,400; H * E kickbacks and
diverted sales totaled $37,371.30; Triplett had similar arrangements with Jerry
Wickliffe but, because Wickliffe ultimately did not pay the agreed-on kickbacks,
the court did not add these amounts to its loss calculations.  R121:38,40.
<p><a name="N_22_">22. </a>  The test is not whether there are some insignificant differences in the
modus operandi of the various schemes (for instance, that Triplett did not have an
ownership interest in the valves ECI sold to Pratt, or that Triplett took his
kickbacks in the form of discounts to buyers rather than overcharges by suppliers,
Def. Br. 25), but whether the general modus operandi and purpose, victims, or
other factors are sufficiently similar to suggest a common plan or scheme.
<p><a name="N_23_">23. </a>  The phrase is taken from the background commentary to &#167;1B1.3, which
explains that "[s]ubsections (a)(1) and (a)(2) adopt different rules because offenses
of the character dealt with in subsection (a)(2) (<u>i.e.</u>, to which &#167;3D1.2(d) applies)
<u>often</u> involve a pattern of misconduct that cannot readily be broken into discrete,
identifiable units that are meaningful for purposes of sentencing" (emphasis
added).  This does not mean that discrete, identifiable units can never be included
as relevant conduct if they otherwise meet the (a)(2) test.<strong></strong>
<p><a name="N_24_">24. </a>  That Triplett was not named as a co-defendant in the IV or Matheson
criminal informations is irrelevant.  Def. Br. 24.  In those cases, IV and Matheson
were pleading guilty to the charges that they conspired with an unnamed Pratt
employee (Triplett) to defraud Pratt.  Triplett did not have to be separately indicted
for every crime with which he could have been charged, or have all his conduct
included in one overarching charge.
<p><a name="N_25_">25. </a>  Nor is it relevant whether the statute of limitations on Cain and ECI has
"long expired."  Def. Br. 24.  The ECI conduct, of course, continued right up to
the start of the charged conspiracy.  And, in any event, relevant conduct may
include criminal conduct that occurred outside of the statute of limitations period. 
<u>Behr</u>, 93 F.3d at 765-66.  
<p><a name="N_26_">26. </a>  The tape transcript was part of the record submitted to the Probation
Office and was entered in the district court docket on August 25, 2003 without a
docket number.  <u>See</u> <u>infra</u> note 28. 
<p><a name="N_27_">27. </a>  The government also argued that Triplett should receive an obstruction
enhancement under USSG &#167;3C1.1, comment. (n.3(b)) because he had committed
perjury at trial by denying he had defrauded Pratt after he had admitted defrauding
Pratt in a December 15, 1998 FBI interview.  R121:28; R124:364, 369.  The court
rejected this argument, however.
<p><a name="N_28_">28. </a>  The Wickliffe transcript is Exhibit 1F to the government's letter of
August 21, 2003, to the Probation Office.  These documents were entered in the
district court docket on August 25, 2003 "per order by Judge Pannell," but were
not given a docket number.
<p><a name="N_29_">29. </a>  There is no suggestion that the FBI's visit to Triplett in 1998 was part of
a "separate investigation," and that a wholly new investigation was begun into the
conduct giving rise to the charges in this case.<strong></strong>
<p><a name="N_30_">30. </a>  This conclusion is buttressed by the fact that Triplett told a potential
witness he had taken steps to be sure the FBI would not find out about his dealings
with the Scruggs brothers.  R121:24; Wickliffe at 109-11 (<u>see</u> <u>supra</u> note 28).
<p><a name="N_31_">31. </a>  In <u>United States v. Bagwell</u>, 30 F.3d 1454, 1458 (11th Cir. 1994), in
contrast, this Court reversed an obstruction enhancement because the district court
had "expressly found that [defendant] hindered law enforcement's investigation of
the Smith/Pardue drug conspiracy &#151; an offense other than that of Bagwell's
conviction."
<p><a name="N_32_">32. </a>  To the extent an indictment alleges facts that are not elements of an
offense, it is mere surplusage, an amendment of which is not <em>per se</em> reversible
error.  <u>Williams</u>, 334 F.3d at 1231-32.
<p><a name="N_33_">33. </a>   A constructive amendment must be distinguished from a "variance,"
which occurs when the evidence at trial establishes facts materially different from
those alleged in the indictment, but the essential elements of the offense are the
same.  <u>Keller</u>, 916 F.2d at 633-34.  Triplett expressly denies that he is claiming a
variance in this case.  Def. Br. 34.  That is not surprising.  To prove reversible
error from a variance, Triplett would have to show, not only that the evidence was
"materially different" from what was charged, but also that he actually suffered
"substantial prejudice."  <u>United States v. Caporale</u>, 806 F.2d 1487, 1499 (11th<sup></sup> Cir.
1986) (variance reversible only when it "actually prejudices the defendant")<u></u>;
<u>United States v. Starrett</u>, 55 F.3d 1525, 1553 (11th<sup></sup> Cir. 1995).
<p><a name="N_34_">34. </a>  Similarly, the government's reference in its closing to the $175 cost to
which Triplett now objects, Def. Br. 31-32, came in <u>rebuttal</u> after Triplett's
counsel had argued that he should be acquitted because Pratt made money on
every valve sale.
<p><a name="N_35_">35. </a>  The government never argued that Triplett defrauded Pratt "of the right to
make greater profits that it otherwise made," <u>see</u> Def. Br. 31; indeed, it never used
the term "right" at all.  Nor did the government claim that Pratt had a legal right to
monopoly profits, Def. Br. 32, or that the cost Scruggs and Triplett paid for the
valves was a "material fact to Pratt as Pratt was entitled to make greater profits." 
Def. Br. 33 (providing a record cite, but failing to quote the government's actual
language).  What the government argued was that Triplett failed to tell his boss
what he paid for the valves so that he could be the "one that made the money,"
instead of Pratt.  R119:4.
