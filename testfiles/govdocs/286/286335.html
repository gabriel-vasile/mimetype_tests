        <p> The district court recognized that Rattoballi committed "substantial 
          crimes" (A-180) for which the Guidelines would normally call for 27 
          to 33 months' imprisonment. A-174-175. Nonetheless, in a non-Guidelines 
          sentence, it imposed no imprisonment, because of what it apparently 
          considered unique factors in this case justifying such leniency. A-181-183. 
          The district court erred, because some of the factors it relied on are 
          impermissible and because others, though permissible, suffered yet other 
          infirmities. Defendant's brief fails to justify the sentence, and indeed 
          makes no serious attempt to defend most of the improper factors on which 
          the district court relied. 
        <p> a. While a judge post-<u>Booker</u><a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> 
          may impose a non-Guidelines sentence, it is unreasonable to rest such 
          a sentence in whole or in part on impermissible factors. <u>United States 
          v. Godding</u>, 405 F.3d 125 (2d Cir. 2005) (per curiam). In <u>Godding</u>, 
          the Guidelines called for imprisonment of 24 to 30 months for the defendant's 
          bank embezzlement, but the court imposed a non-Guidelines sentence of 
          no imprisonment, relying in part on the bank's failure to detect and 
          prevent the embezzlement. In remanding the case for resentencing, this 
          Court ruled that the bank's inadequacy in this regard was an impermissible 
          sentencing factor under post-<u>Booker</u> "reasonableness" review. 
          <u>Id.</u> at 126-127. 
        <p> In this case, as in <u>Godding</u>, the district court rested its 
          leniency on impermissible factors. 
        <p> First, the court justified its sentence on the ground that the defendant 
          stood convicted of the crimes charged, and conviction itself was "not 
          without meaning as far as punishment." A-181. While conviction alone 
          may be sufficient punishment for minor offenses that result in Guidelines 
          sentencing ranges that begin with zero months of imprisonment, it cannot 
          justify leniency for one who, as the district court conceded, has committed 
          "substantial crimes" (A-180), because it is not unique to Rattoballi 
          or his circumstances. Rather, it is true of every defendant to be sentenced, 
          for without a conviction, there cannot be a sentence. 
        <p> Second, the court relied on the fact that the defendant pled guilty 
          and thus "did not force the government to go to trial." A-181. By definition, 
          a defendant's guilty plea means that the government is not forced to 
          try him; this reasoning therefore applies to every defendant who pleads 
          guilty, and cannot justify leniency specially for Rattoballi. 
        <p> Third, the court relied on the pendency of these proceedings "hanging 
          over [Rattoballi] for a period of three years." A-181. This too was 
          impermissible. Proceedings of this sort involving multiple defendants, 
          some pleading guilty and some insisting on a trial, are common and often 
          protracted. Once again, there is nothing here to set Rattoballi apart 
          from vast numbers of other similarly situated criminals. Moreover, as 
          the district court recognized, part of the reason why the proceedings 
          hung over him for so long is that, contrary to the terms of his plea 
          bargain, he failed fully to cooperate with the government and he obstructed 
          the investigation by lying to prosecutors about the full extent of his 
          involvement and the involvement of others. A-160, 165, 167, 181.<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> 
        <p> Finally, the court excused Rattoballi from serving a prison sentence 
          to "assist" him in earning money so that he could pay restitution. A-183 
          ("Maybe he can sell a home or something, but mainly it will assist greatly 
          in the restitution picture if [he] continues to earn money"). Restitution 
          cannot be a substitute for prison for a convicted felon, 18 U.S.C. 3663A(a)(1); 
          <u>United States v. Rivera</u>, 994 F.2d 942, 955-56 (1st Cir. 1993) 
          (Breyer, J.),<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> particularly where, 
          as here, Rattoballi himself has conceded to some "modest wealth," A-66, 
          and has various means of paying restitution from his assets, his business, 
          or his prison wages. <u>See</u> U.S. Br. 31-32 (government's opening 
          brief). 
        <p> b. By itself, the district court's erroneous reliance on these factors 
          requires a new sentencing free from consideration of impermissible concerns. 
          <u>Godding</u>, <u>supra</u>. The district court further erred, however, 
          in determining that the defendant should not be incarcerated based on 
          a consideration that the defendant did not advance and that the United 
          States did not have an opportunity to address. Rattoballi never made 
          the claim that incarceration "would absolutely end [his] business" (A-182); 
          the record evidence does not support it; and the United States did not 
          have an adequate chance to explore the issue at the sentencing hearing. 
          U.S. Br. 28-31. When as here a court chooses a sentence radically below 
          that recommended by the Guidelines, it must conduct its decisionmaking 
          with particular care. Otherwise, the continuing importance of the Guidelines 
          emphasized by <u>Booker</u>, 125 S. Ct. at 767, and <u>United States 
          v. Crosby</u>, 397 F.3d 103, 113 (2d Cir. 2005), will be wrongly diminished. 
          Indeed, 18 U.S.C. 3553(c)(2) imposes on courts the additional requirement 
          of a "specific" written explanation for sentences that are "outside 
          the [Guidelines] range." <u>See also</u> <u>Godding</u>, 405 F.3d at 
          127 (expressing concern "that the brevity of the term of imprisonment 
          imposed . . . does not reflect the magnitude of the theft," and emphasizing 
          that the sentence must "reflect the seriousness of the offense" and 
          other section 3553(a) factors). Since there will have to be a new sentencing 
          hearing in any event, <u>see</u> pp. 1-4, <u>supra</u>, at that hearing 
          the government should be allowed a fair opportunity to develop and present 
          contrary evidence on this issue. 
        <p> Similarly, because the district court abdicated its duty of reasoned 
          decision-making when it failed to impose any prison term on the premise 
          that Rattoballi was less culpable than Mitchell Mosallem, a co-conspirator 
          who received a 70-month prison sentence (A-164, 182), the issue should 
          be remanded for reconsideration. Neither the government nor the probation 
          office had recommended that Rattoballi be treated as sternly as Mosallem. 
          And even Rattoballi himself says that he should be treated similarly 
          to another co-conspirator with a "similar record[]" and "found guilty 
          of similar conduct," who was sentenced to 15 months in prison by another 
          judge. Deft. Br. 35.<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a> 
        <p> 
        <ol start="2">
          <li> <u><a name="b"></a>Error In Failure To Impose A Fine</u> 
        </ol>
        <p> The district court's finding that Rattoballi had the "inability to 
          pay" a fine (A-192) is clearly erroneous. Defendant conceded to the 
          trial court that he "had accumulated some modest wealth" and was fully 
          capable of paying a "modest fine," in addition to paying "restitution 
          for which Mr. Rattoballi is responsible." A- 66. In fact, defendant 
          admitted to assets well over $l million, A-66, and the court found that 
          Rattoballi had substantial assets to pay $155,000 in restitution. A-183. 
          Nevertheless, the court did not impose even the minimum Guidelines fine 
          of $20,000. <u>See</u> U.S. Br. 38-39. 
        <p> The defendant's efforts to defend the mistaken finding with a reason 
          the court itself never mentioned (the court's supposed desire not to 
          hamper Rattoballi's ability to pay restitution, Deft. Br. 21), is unsound. 
          It is plainly the court's obligation under 18 U.S.C. 3553(c) to state 
          its reasons for the sentence, and a clearly erroneous reason cannot 
          be saved by post-hoc rationalization of defendant's counsel. Moreover, 
          defendant's explanation cannot be squared with the facts in the record, 
          which show that Rattoballi can pay both restitution and a fine. A-66. 
        <p>
          <center>
            <a name="c"></a>CONCLUSION 
          </center>
        <p> The sentence should be vacated and the case remanded for resentencing. 
        <p> Respectfully submitted.

<a name="N_1_">1. </a> <u>United States v. Booker</u>, 125 S. Ct. 738 
          (2005). 
        <p><a name="N_2_">2. </a> Defendant makes no attempt to defend the court's 
          reasoning on these three impermissible factors and instead claims that 
          the sentence is supported by his admitted lack of criminal history and 
          evidence of his good character. Deft. Br. 25. The court did not rest 
          the sentence on these factors. 
        <p><a name="N_3_">3. </a> The defendant's effort to dismiss this part 
          of Judge Breyer's rationale in <u>Rivera</u> is unpersuasive. Thus, 
          while <u>Rivera</u> was a pre-<u>Booker</u> Guidelines departure case 
          (Deft. Br. 23), it remains relevant here because it speaks to the 3553(a) 
          factors that are relevant in all sentencing cases. Moreover, 18 U.S.C. 
          3663A(a)(1), which requires an order of restitution "<u>in addition 
          to</u> . . . any other penalty authorized by law" (emphasis added), 
          also applies in all sentencing contexts. And while Rattoballi cites 
          dicta from <u>United States v. Ranum</u>, 353 F. Supp. 2d 984 (E.D. 
          Wis. 2005) (Deft. Br. 27), in that non-Guidelines case, which did not 
          involve restitution, the court did impose a term of imprisonment, because 
          imprisonment was required to "promote respect for the law." <u>Id.</u> 
          at 991. 
        <p><a name="N_4_">4. </a> In fact, the defendant sentenced to 15 months 
          was far less culpable in the fraud than Rattoballi. <u>See</u> A-163. 
          Moreover, the defendant who received a sentence of probation from Judge 
          Griesa (<u>see</u> Deft. Br. 35) was an 82 year-old man whose heroin-addicted 
          son required the defendant's personal attention and support to keep 
          from relapsing. A-163-64.<strong></strong>
