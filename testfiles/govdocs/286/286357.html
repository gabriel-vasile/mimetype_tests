| LOSS OF POWER TO THE TECHNICAL SUPPORT CENTER (TSC)                          |
|                                                                              |
| Breaker 13-40 tripped with the ground flag dropped.  This breaker supplies   |
| primary power to the TSC.  There is a backup diesel generator available to   |
| supply power to the TSC but will not be energized until it is determined     |
| that there is no ground at the TSC.  Once the TSC D/G is energized the       |
| facility will once again be available.                                       |
|                                                                              |

| The diesel generator is now supplying the TSC with electrical power (as of   |
| 1041 CST).  Investigation continues into why breaker 13-40 tripped.          |
|                                                                              |

| The licensee is retracting this event. Upon review of the potential loss of  |
| emergency communications and assessment capability they have determined that |
| no such loss would have happened with the initial problem.                   |

| A Cs-137 vaginal cylinder implant was loaded at 9:30 am on 1/23/01.  The     |
| written directive called for a total implant time of 49 hours.  During a     |
| check of the patient at 7:30 am on 1/24/01, the authorized user found the    |
| loaded vaginal cylinder on the patient's toilet seat.  The patient's nurse   |
| stated that the source came out at about 6:30 am on 1/24/01 (i.e., after     |
| about 42% of the prescribed dose was delivered).  The licensee was not sure  |
| how the source got to where it was found.  The authorized user placed the    |
| cylinder in a lead pig and transported it to the secured storage area.  The  |
| authorized user decided to write another written directive and reload the    |
| patient at 10:00 am on 1/24/01 with a prescribed implant time of 7 hours.    |
| After the 7 hours, the sources were explanted as intended.  The authorized   |
| user decided to deliver the remaining radiation dose to the treatment site   |
| via teletherapy.                                                             |

| At 6:00 am on 1/24/01, the nurse emptied the patient's foley bag and noted   |
| that the patient was in bed.  Between 6:00 and 6:30 am on 1/24/01, the nurse |
| noticed that the patient was leaving the bathroom to go back to bed.  The    |
| nurse also noticed that the patient's "T-binder" (used to hold the           |
| applicator in place), was loose, so she tightened it.  The authorized user   |
| visited the patient at 7:30 am and noticed that the T-binder was on the      |
| bathroom floor and the loaded vaginal cylinder was on the toilet seat.       |
| Based on nurse interviews, all nurses caring for the patient were badged,    |
| and none of them handled the applicator.                                     |

| TRANSPORT AND SUBSEQUENT DISCOVERY OF SCRAP METAL CONTAINING 50 MILLICURIES  |

| On 02/13/01, Martin Marietta Anderson Creek Quarry (located in Rockville,    |
| Virginia, near Richmond) shipped scrap metal to Cycle Systems (a scrap yard  |
| located in Lynchburg, Virginia).  Cycle Systems surveyed the material and    |
| discovered 50 millicuries of cesium-137.  (The material was apparently a     |
| sensor or level gauge from a conveyer system.)                               |
|                                                                              |
| Cycle Systems notified the quarry and the State of Virginia.  The State of   |
| Virginia notified the NRC Region 2 office, and the NRC Region 2 office (Wade |
| Loo) contacted the quarry.                                                   |
|                                                                              |
| The material was returned to the quarry on 02/15/01.  The shutter is         |
| currently locked closed, and the material has been placed in an office.      |
| Martin Marietta Anderson Creek Quarry believes that the material may have    |
| come from another quarry.  The actual source of the material is currently    |
| being investigated.                                                          |
|                                                                              |

| HIGH PRESSURE COOLANT INJECTION SYSTEM (HPCI) DECLARED INOPERABLE            |

| "During normal monitoring of the standby lineup of the High Pressure Coolant |
| Injection System (HPCI), the building rounds operator noticed that the HPCI  |
| discharge flow switch (23FS-78) was indicating 140 gpm with zero actual      |
| flow.  This flow switch controls the operation of the HPCI pump minimum flow |
| valve during HPCI operations.  Upon further investigation by the operating   |
| crew, it was also determined that the HPCI pump discharge flow transmitter   |
| was exhibiting sporadic flow spikes of 50 to 100 gpm with zero system flow.  |
| This flow signal is used to control HPCI turbine speed and flowrate.  Based  |
| on these findings, the HPCI system was declared inoperable per Technical     |
| Specification 3.5.c and a 7 day Limiting Condition for Operation was         |
| entered."                                                                    |

| TECH SPEC REQUIRED SHUTDOWN COMMENCED AFTER DECLARING BOTH STANDBY GAS       |
| TREATMENT (SGT) TRAINS INOPERABLE                                            |
|                                                                              |
| "While performing Surveillance 6.SUMP.101, Z SUMP AND AIR EJECTOR HOLDUP     |
| LINE DRAIN OPERABILITY TEST (IST), Z-1 sump pump exceeded its operability    |
| time limit of 151 seconds by 3 seconds. When Z-2 sump pump was subsequently  |
| tested, the pump failed to start on the essential HI-HI level switch.  Both  |
| sump pumps were declared INOPERABLE. These pumps support Standby Gas         |
| Treatment OPERABILITY. The SGT line from the plant runs underground to the   |
| Elevated Release Point tower, and the offgas line and SGT both enter this    |
| sump. The pumps remove condensation from both the offgas lines and SGT, and  |
| must be available post-accident to prevent flooding of the SGT lines.        |
|                                                                              |
| "Per administrative direction in the Surveillance procedure, both trains of  |
| SGT were declared INOPERABLE at 2108.  Per Technical Specification 3.6.4.3,  |
| Condition D, with two SGT subsystems INOPERABLE in Mode 1, the Required      |
| Action is to enter LCO 3.0.3 immediately.  LCO 3.0.3 requires the plant to   |
| be in Mode 2 within 7 hours, Mode 3 within 13 hours, and Mode 4 within 37    |
| hours.  A power reduction was commenced at 2250. Present power level is      |
| 54%.                                                                         |

| "Engineering personnel have responded to the plant and are evaluating the    |
| two conditions."                                                             |

| The above surveillance is performed quarterly.  The licensee noted a past    |
| history of problems with the system's level switches.  The current rate of   |
| power reduction is approximately 100 MW/hr or 12-15% reactor power. The      |
| licensee informed the NRC resident inspector.                                |

| Tech Spec required shutdown exited at 0334CST after engineering determined   |
| that one train of SGT was OPERABLE.  The Unit remains in a 7-day LCO for the |
