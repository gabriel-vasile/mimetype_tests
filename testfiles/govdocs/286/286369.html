<h3><a name="1">Preface</a></h3>
    <p>The data contained in this bulletin represent the
    complete count of employment and wages for workers covered by unemployment
    insurance programs during 2001 in the 50 States, the District of Columbia,
    Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. These data are the product of a
    Federal-State cooperative program known as the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages
    (QCEW) program. State Employment Security Agencies compile the data from
    reports filed by employers each quarter. The Bureau of Labor Statistics
    aggregates the data by industry and ownership. These aggregations are
    available at the county, Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), Consolidated
    Metropolitan Statistical Area (CMSA), State, and national levels. Only
    State- and national-level aggregates appear in the tables in this
    publication. A map showing change in employment in large counties appears as
    well.</p>
    <p>This is the first year in which the QCEW data are produced
    based on the North American Industry Classification System, or NAICS. NAICS
    is the product of a cooperative effort on the part of the statistical
    agencies of the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Due to differences in
    structure between NAICS and the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC)
    system that was previously used, industry data for 2001 will not be
    comparable with the SIC-based data for earlier years.</p>

    <p>The Bureau wishes to express its appreciation to employers for their
    continued cooperation in providing establishment-level data on the Multiple
    Worksite Report (MWR). The State Employment Security Agencies that collect
    the data from employers also play a major role in this ongoing program.
    Their efforts in verifying, editing, and supplying high quality data to the
    Bureau of Labor Statistics are essential to the accuracy of the data in this
    bulletin.</p>
<h3><a name="1b">Introduction</a></h3>
    <p>This publication presents 2001 annual employment and
    wages data as defined under the 2002 North American Industry Classification
    System (NAICS). These data pertain to workers covered by State unemployment
    insurance (UI) laws and Federal civilian workers covered by the Unemployment
    Compensation for Federal Employees (UCFE) program. The data for both private
    sector and public sector workers are reported to the Bureau of Labor
    Statistics (BLS) by the employment security agencies of the 50 States, the
    District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands as part of the
    Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages program.</p>
    <p>In 2001, employers in private industry provided State
    Employment Security Agencies with quarterly tax reports on monthly
    employment, quarterly total and taxable wages, and contributions for an
    average of 109.3 million wage and salary employees in approximately 7.7
    million business establishments. Similar reports of monthly employment and
    quarterly wages were submitted by the Federal Government for 2.8 million
    civilian employees, by State governments for 4.5 million employees, and by
    local governments for 13.1 million employees. Covered employment reported by
    these sources constituted a virtual census (97.1 percent) of employees on
    nonfarm payrolls. The principal exclusions from UI and UCFE coverage are
    cited in the appendix, "Characteristics and Uses of the Data,"
    which follows the tables.</p>
    <p>Data are presented by ownership, industry, and State and
    include the average number of establishments, annual average employment,
    total wages, and annual and average weekly wages per employee. National
    employment and wage totals are published for 11 supersectors, 20 sectors,
    and almost all of the 1,179 six-digit NAICS industries. Private sector data
    are presented, by State, from the total private ownership level to the
    six-digit industry level. State, local, and Federal Government data are
    detailed for selected industries.</p>
    <p>Beginning with the release of data for 2001, publications
    presenting data from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) program will use
    the 2002 version of the North American Industry Classification System
    (NAICS) as the basis for the assignment and tabulation of economic data by
    industry. NAICS is the product of a cooperative effort on the part of the
    statistical agencies of the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Due to
    differences in structure between NAICS and the Standard Industrial
    Classification (SIC) system that was previously used, industry data for 2001
    will not be comparable with the SIC-based data for earlier years.</p>
    <p>NAICS uses a production-oriented approach to categorize
    economic units. Units with similar production processes are classified in
    the same industry. NAICS focuses on <em>how<strong> </strong></em>products and services
    are created, as opposed to the SIC focus on <em>what</em> is produced. This
    approach yields industry groupings that are significantly different from
    those produced using the SIC approach.</p>
    <p>Data users will be able to work with new NAICS industrial
    groupings that better reflect the workings of the U.S. economy. For example,
    a new industry sector called <em>Information</em> brings together units which
    turn information into a commodity with units which distribute that
    commodity. <em>Informations</em> major components are publishing,
    broadcasting, telecommunications, information services, and data processing.
    Under the SIC system, these units were spread across the manufacturing,
    communications, business services, and amusement services groups. Another
    new sector of interest is <em>Professional and Technical Services</em>. This
    sector consists of establishments engaged in activities to which human
    capital is the major input.</p>

<h3>Characteristics and uses of the data</h3>
<h3><a name="2a">Characteristics</a></h3>
    <p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) compiled the data in this
    publication as part of the operations of its Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW)
    program. The data are derived from the quarterly tax reports submitted to
    State Employment Security Agencies by employers subject to State
    unemployment insurance (UI) laws and from Federal agencies subject to the
    Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees (UCFE) program. Each
    quarter, State agencies edit and process the data and send the information
    to BLS in Washington, DC.</p>
<h3><a name="2b">Unemployment insurance laws and coverage</a></h3>
    <p>Initially, the Federal Unemployment Insurance Tax Act
    (1938) applied only to firms employing at least 8 persons for a minimum of
    20 weeks in a calendar year and excluded certain categories of workers.
    Amendments to Title XV of the Social Security Actthe program of
    Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employeesextended coverage to
    Federal civilian employees effective January 1, 1955, and to workers in
    firms employing from four to seven workers effective January 1, 1956.</p>
    <p>Federal legislation, effective January 1, 1972, extended
    coverage of State unemployment insurance systems to firms employing 1 worker
    or more in 28 States and expanded some of the statutory coverage provisions.
    The remaining States had previously extended coverage to these small
    employers. The 1972 legislation also brought coverage to employees of State
    hospitals, colleges, and universities.</p>
    <p>The Federal Unemployment Compensation Amendments of 1976
    incorporated major changes in State unemployment insurance laws effective
    January 1, 1978. Under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA), States
    expanded coverage to include nearly all remaining State and local government
    employees, employees of nonprofit elementary and secondary schools, and
    certain domestic workers. Some States began implementing the amendments as
    early as 1976. The law also brought the Virgin Islands under the UI system.</p>
    <p>The 1976 amendments covered agricultural labor if
    performed for an employer who, in any calendar quarter in the current or
    preceding calendar year, paid cash remuneration of $20,000 or more for
    individuals employed in agricultural labor. The 1976 amendments also apply
    to employers who, on each of some 20 days in 20 different weeks during the
    current or preceding calendar year, employed at least 10 individuals in
    agricultural labor.</p>
    <p>Under a 1981 Supreme Court ruling, schools affiliated
    with religious organizations are not required to be covered under the UI
    system. Many of these schools, however, continue to cover their employees on
    a voluntary basis. Special provisions for railroad workers are made through
    the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act. Data for workers covered under the
    Railroad Retirement Board and for those covered under Unemployment
    Compensation for Ex-servicemen (UCX) programs are excluded from the tables
    in this publication.</p>
    <p>Comparisons of data from one State to another should take
    into consideration the differences in UI laws between States. In addition,
    when UI-covered private industry employment data are compared directly with
    other employment series, the coverage exclusions should be taken into
    account.</p>
    <p>Excluded from private sector coverage in 2001 were
    approximately:</p>

<p>Certain types of nonprofit employers, such as religious organizations, are
given a choice of coverage or exclusion in a number of States. Workers in these
organizations are, therefore, reported to a limited degree. Details on coverage
laws are provided in <em>Comparison of State Unemployment Insurance Laws</em>,
available upon request from the Employment and Training Administration of the
U.S. Department of Labor.</p>
<h3><a name="2c">Industrial classification</a></h3>
    <p>Employment and wage data developed in the QCEW program
    have been classified by industry since 1938. An industrial code is assigned
    to each establishment by the State agency, based on a description provided
    by the employer on a questionnaire. If a private or government employer
    conducts different activities at various establishments or installations,
    separate industrial codes are assigned, to the extent possible, to each
    establishment.</p>
    <p>The data presented in this bulletin are classified in
    accordance with the 2002 North American Industry Classification System
    (NAICS). The NAICS manual defines:</p>
    <ul>
<li>20 sectors</li>
      <li>100 subsectors</li>
      <li>317 four-digit industry groups</li>
      <li>725 five-digit NAICS industries</li>
      <li>1,179 six-digit industries.</li>
    </ul>
<p>BLS has extended the NAICS coding upwards, into two
    domains and 11 supersectors. Additionally, BLS has extended NAICS downward
    in subsector 238, <em>Specialty trade contractors</em>, dividing the 19
    industries into residential and nonresidential categories.</p>
    <p>BLS files also include totals for unclassified records at
    each NAICS level of aggregation. <em>Unclassified </em>is its own supersector
    under the service-producing domain.</p>
    <p>BLS publishes NAICS industry data under the principle
    that, so long as there is additional detail to be gained by publishing the
    next lower level, it will do so. This principle of "<a href="/cew/cewcong.htm">congruent
    data</a>" means that BLS will publish all data to the six-digit industry
    level if there are two or more six-digit industries. If there is only one
    such industry, BLS publishes only the five-digit NAICS industry level.
    Likewise, if there is only one six-digit industry and one five-digit NAICS
    industry under a four-digit industry group, BLS will publish only the
    four-digit industry group. At this time, there are 7 four-digit industry
    groups that roll up to the three-digit subsector level, 68 five-digit NAICS
    industries that roll up to the four-digit industry group level, and 415
    six-digit industries that roll up to the five-digit NAICS industry level.</p>
    <p>Additionally, there are two six-digit industries that
    have a significant last digit of "0." These are <em>Commercial
    lithographic printing</em>, NAICS 323110; and <em>Electromedical apparatus
    manufacturing</em>, NAICS 334510. Both of the five-digit NAICS industries
    have 10 six-digit industries under them. Thus, NAICS codes should not be
    padded with zeroes.</p>
    <p>To ensure the highest possible quality of data, State Employment Security
    Agencies verify and update, if necessary, the NAICS, location, and ownership
    classifications of all establishments on a 3-year cycle. Government units in
    the public administration sector, however, are verified less frequently.
    Each year, changes in establishment classification codes resulting from the
    verification process are introduced with the data reported for the first
    quarter.</p>
    <strong>
    <p><a name="2d">Indian Tribal Data</a></p>
    </strong>
    <p>Effective January 2001, the QCEW program began assigning
    Indian Tribal Councils and related establishments to local government
    ownership. This BLS action was in response to a change in Federal law
    dealing with the way Indian Tribes are treated under FUTA. This law requires
    federally recognized Indian Tribes to be treated similarly to State and
    local governments. In the past, the QCEW program coded Indian Tribal Councils
    and related establishments in the private sector.</p>
    <p>As a result of the new law, QCEW data will reflect significant shifts in
    employment and wages between the private sector and local government from
    2000 to 2001. BLS incorporated this change in first-quarter 2001 data
    because of the immediate effectiveness of the law, signed December 21, 2000.
    Data will also reflect industry changes. In addition to the change to local
    government, the industry codes of federally recognized Indian Tribal
    Councils were changed. Those accounts previously assigned to civic and
    social organizations were assigned to tribal governments. There were no
    required industry changes for related establishments owned by these Tribal
    Councils. These tribal business establishments continued to be coded
    according to the nature of their economic activity.</p>
<h3><a name="2e">Employment</a></h3>
    <p>In general, QCEW monthly employment data represent the
    number of covered workers who worked during, or received pay for, the pay
    period that included the 12th day of the month. Virtually all workers are
    reported in the State in which their jobs are physically located.</p>
    <p>Covered private industry employment includes most
    corporate officials, executives, supervisory personnel, professionals,
    clerical workers, wage earners, piece workers, and part-time workers. It
    excludes proprietors, the unincorporated self-employed, unpaid family
    members, and certain farm and domestic workers.</p>
    <p>Persons on paid sick leave, paid holiday, paid vacation,
    and the like are included. Persons on the payroll of more than one firm
    during the period are counted by each UI-subject employer if they meet the
    employment definition noted above. Workers are counted even though, in the
    latter months of the year, their wages may not be subject to unemployment
    insurance tax. The employment count excludes workers who earned no wages
    during the entire applicable pay period because of work stoppages, temporary
    layoffs, illness, or unpaid vacations.</p>
    <p>Employment data reported for Federal civilian employees
    are a byproduct of the operations of State Employment Security Agencies in
    administering the provisions of Title XV of the Social Security Actthe
    program of Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees. Federal
    employment data are based on reports of monthly employment and quarterly
    wages submitted each quarter to State agencies for all Federal installations
    with employees covered by the Act, except for certain national security
    agencies, which are omitted for security reasons.</p>
    <p>Employment of all Federal agencies for any given month is based on the
    number of persons who worked during or received pay for the pay period that
    included the 12th of the month.</p>
<h3><a name="2f">Establishments and employment size</a></h3>
    <p>An establishment is an economic unit, such as a farm,
    mine, factory, or store, that produces goods or provides services. It is
    typically at a single physical location and engaged in one, or predominantly
    one, type of economic activity for which a single industrial classification
    may be applied. Occasionally, a single physical location encompasses two or
    more distinct and significant activities. Each activity is reported as a
    separate establishment if separate records are kept, and the various
    activities are classified under different NAICS industries.</p>
    <p>Most employers have only one establishment; thus, the
    establishment is the predominant reporting unit or statistical entity for
    reporting employment and wages data. Most employers who operate more than
    one establishment in a State file a Multiple Worksite Report (MWR) each
    quarter, in addition to their quarterly UI report. The MWR form is used to
    collect separate employment and wage data for each of the employers
    establishments, which are not detailed on the UI report. Some very small
    multiestablishment employers do not file a MWR. When the total employment in
    an employers secondary establishments (all establishments other than the
    largest) is 10 or fewer, the employer generally will file a consolidated
    report for all establishments. Also, some employers either cannot or will
    not report at the establishment level and thus aggregate establishments into
    one consolidated unit, or possibly several units, though not at the
    establishment level.</p>
    <p>Prior to 1991, employers provided covered employment and
    wages data on a "reporting unit" basis. Reporting unit data
    typically provided detail only for different county locations or industrial
    operations within a State. Nonstandard forms, similar in concept to the MWR
    and called the Statistical Supplement, were used by States to collect these
    county industry data. Although reporting units were, for the most part,
    individual establishments, employers could provide a summary of their
    employment and wages data for multiple establishments within a county that
    were conducting the same type of industrial activity. For example, a
    fast-food business might have submitted a single report that covered all its
    operations within a county prior to 1991; on the MWR, the employer reports
    employment and wages data for each individual location.</p>
    <p>For government, the reporting unit is the installation: a
    single location at which a department, agency, or other government body has
    civilian employees. Federal agencies follow slightly different criteria than
    do private employers when breaking down their reports by installation. They
    are permitted to combine as a single statewide unit (1) all installations
    with 10 workers or fewer and (2) all installations that have a combined
    total in the State of fewer than 50 workers. Also, when there are fewer than
    25 workers in all secondary installations in a State, the secondary
    installations may be combined and reported with the major installation.
    Lastly, if a Federal agency has fewer than five employees in a State, the
    agency headquarters office (regional office, district office) serving each
    State may consolidate the employment and wages data for that State with the
    data reported to the State in which the headquarters is located. As a result
    of these reporting rules, the number of reporting units is always larger
    than the number of employers (or government agencies) but smaller than the
    number of actual establishments (or installations).</p>
    <p>Data reported for the first quarter of 2001 were tabulated into size
    categories ranging from worksites of very small size to those with 1,000
    employees or more. The size category is determined by the establishments
    March employment level. It is important to note that data for each
    establishment of a multiestablishment firm are tabulated separately into the
    appropriate size category. The total employment level of the reporting
    multiestablishment firm is not used in the size tabulation.</p>
<h3><a name="2g">Wages</a></h3>
    <em>
    <p>Total wages</p></em>. Covered employers in most States report
    total compensation paid during the calendar quarter, regardless of when the
    services were performed. A few State laws, however, specify that wages be
    reported for or based on the period during which services are performed
    rather than the period during which compensation is paid. Under most State
    laws or regulations, wages include bonuses, stock options, the cash value of
    meals and lodging, tips and other gratuities, and, in some States, employer
    contributions to certain deferred compensation plans such as 401(k) plans.
    <p>Covered employer contributions for old-age, survivors,
    and disability insurance (OASDI), health insurance, unemployment insurance,
    workers compensation, and private pension and welfare funds are not
    reported as wages. Employee contributions for the same purposes, however, as
    well as money withheld for income taxes, union dues, and so forth, are
    reported even though they are deducted from the workers gross pay.</p>
    <p>Wages of covered Federal workers represent the gross
    amount of all payrolls for all pay periods ending within the quarter. This
    includes cash allowances, the cash equivalent of any type of remuneration,
    severance pay, withholding taxes, and retirement deductions. Federal
    employee remuneration generally covers the same types of services as does
    remuneration for workers in private industry. Depending on the method (cash
    or accrual basis) used by the Federal agency in preparing its quarterly
    summary balance, the gross amount of payrolls is either paid or payable.</p>
    <em>
    <p>Average wages</p></em>. Average annual wages per employee for
    any given industry are computed by dividing total annual wages by annual
    average employment. A further division by 52 yields average weekly wages per
    employee. Annual pay data only approximate annual earnings because an
    individual may not be employed by the same employer all year or may work for
    more than one employer at a time.
    <p>Average weekly or annual pay is affected by the ratio of
    full-time to part-time workers, as well as by the numbers of individuals in
    high-paying and low-paying occupations. When comparing average pay levels
    between States and industries, data users should take these factors into
    consideration. For example, industries characterized by high proportions of
    part-time workers will show average wage levels appreciably less than the
    weekly pay levels of regular full-time employees in these industries. The
    opposite is true of industries with low proportions of part-time workers, or
    industries that typically schedule heavy weekend and overtime work. Average
    wage data also may be influenced by work stoppages, labor turnover,
    retroactive payments, seasonal factors, and bonus payments.</p>
<h3><a name="2h">Disclosure restrictions</a></h3>
<p>In accordance with BLS policy, data reported to the agency in confidence are
not published and are used only for specified statistical purposes. BLS
withholds publication of UI-covered employment and wage data for any industry
level when necessary to protect the identity of cooperating employers. Totals at
the industry level for the States and the Nation include the nondisclosable data
suppressed within the detailed tables. However, these totals cannot be used to
reveal the suppressed data.</p>
<h3><a name="2i">Imputed data</a></h3>
<p>To reduce the effect of data excluded because of late reporting by covered
private and government employers, State agencies impute employment and wages for
such employers and include them in each quarterly report. Corrections to data
that may be entered after a report is filed will include replacement of
imputations with reported data to the extent possible. Imputations are
calculated at the individual establishment level, normally using historical data
reported by the employer. Sometimes, trends reported by employers in the same
industry or information obtained from other sources also are used. If a report
remains delinquent for more than one quarter and research shows that it is still
active, the data for the establishment will again be imputed.</p>
<h3><a name="2j">Comparison of ES-202 covered employment data with other series</a></h3>
    <p><a href="/ces/"><em>Current Employment Statistics</em></a> <em>program</em>.
    BLS and the State Employment Security Agencies cooperate in the operation of
    the Current Employment Statistics (CES) program. In this program, the State
    agencies are responsible for preparing current employment estimates for the
    States and for many metropolitan labor market areas, while BLS is
    responsible for monthly employment estimates for the Nation. CES estimates
    of employment, average weekly and hourly earnings, and average weekly hours
    are derived from an employer survey of approximately 300,000 nonfarm
    establishments, selected primarily from the QCEW administrative records of
    UI-covered employers. The national and State industry CES estimates are then
    benchmarked annually to the QCEW employment data. Supplemental sources are
    used in benchmarking industries that have noncovered workers.</p>
<p><a href="/cps/"><em>Current Population Survey</em></a>. The Current
Population Survey (CPS) is conducted monthly for BLS by the U.S. Census Bureau.
CPS employment data are estimated from a survey of about 60,000 U.S. households,
while QCEW employment data are based on a universe of 8.0 million U.S. covered
employer establishments. The CPS counts employed persons, whereas the QCEW
program counts encumbered jobs during the reporting period. Consequently, the
CPS includes those persons "with a job but not at work" who earn no
wagesfor example, workers on extended unpaid leaves of absence. The QCEW data,
on the other hand, exclude unpaid workers. The QCEW data count separately each
job held by multiple jobholders. The CPS counts such workers once, in the job at
which they worked the greatest number of hours. The CPS counts employed persons
at their place of residence; the QCEW program counts jobs at the place of work.
The CPS also differs from the QCEW program in that it includes self-employed
persons, unpaid family workers employed 15 hours or more during the survey
period, and a greater proportion of agricultural and domestic workers. The CPS
data exclude persons under age 16, while the QCEW program counts all covered
workers regardless of age.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.opm.gov"><em>Office of Personnel Management</em></a> <em>data</em>.&nbsp;
The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) publishes a statistical series on
Federal employment and payrolls with information on employing agencies, types of
positions and appointments, and characteristics of employees. Data on Federal
employment covered by the UCFE series provide industry, local area, and monthly
employment detail not available in the OPM series. These detailed UCFE data are
not published, but are available from BLS upon request.</p>
    <p>Both the UCFE and the OPM data exclude members of the
    Armed Forces, temporary emergency workers employed to cope with
    catastrophes, and officers and crew members of some U.S. vessels. The UCFE
    and the OPM data differ in coverage of workers. For example, the UCFE, but
    not the OPM, includes Department of Defense workers paid from
    nonappropriated funds, employees of county agricultural stabilization and
    conservation committees, State and area marketing committees, and the
    Agricultural Extension Service. The OPM, but not the UCFE, includes workers
    who are not U.S. citizens and who are employed outside the United States and
    its territories; workers paid on a contract or fee basis; paid patients or
    inmates of Federal homes, hospitals, or institutions; and student employees
    of Federal hospitals, clinics, and laboratories.</p>
    <p>The two programs also differ in the payroll reference period. UCFE
    employment data relate to the payroll period that includes the 12th day of
    the month. OPM data, however, relate to persons employed on the last workday
    of the month, plus all intermittent employees.</p>

        <p>CBP data are tabulated based on the 1997 NAICS, with
        some exceptions; QCEW data are tabulated based on the 2002 NAICS.</p>
</li>
      <li>
        <p>CBP data exclude auxiliary establishments (except
        corporate, subsidiary, and regional managing offices) from
        "operating" establishment data and include data for auxiliary
        establishments in a separate NAICS sector. QCEW employment, on the other
        hand, includes data for these establishments at the six-digit industry
        level.</p>
</li>
      <li>
        <p>CBP excludes crop and animal production; U.S. Postal
        Service; pension, health, welfare, and vacation funds; trusts, estates,
        and agency accounts; private households; and public administration.
        These are included in QCEW data.</p>
</li>
      <li>
        <p>CBP excludes most government employees. Most of these workers are included in QCEW employment.</p>
</li>
    </ul>
<h3><a name="2k">Uses of the data</a></h3>
    <p>The QCEW employment and wages data constitute the most
    complete set of monthly employment and quarterly wage information by
    six-digit industry at the national, State, CMSA, MSA, and county levels.
    They have broad economic significance for the evaluation of labor market
    trends and major industry developments, for time series analyses, and for
    interindustry comparisons.</p>
    <p>The <a href="http://www.bea.gov">Bureau of Economic
    Analysis</a> of the U.S. Department of Commerce uses QCEW data as a base for
    developing the wage and salary component of personal income. QCEW data
    accounted for approximately 57 percent of personal income in 2001.</p>
    <p>QCEW data are used by businesses and by public and private
    research organizations as one of the best sources of detailed employment and
    wage statistics for economic forecasting, transportation planning, industry
    and regional analysis, impact studies, and other uses.</p>
    <p>The QCEW program provides data necessary to both the <a href="http://www.doleta.gov">Employment
    and Training Administration</a> of the U.S. Department of Labor and the <a href="http://workforcesecurity.doleta.gov/map.asp">State
    Employment Security Agencies</a> for use in administering the employment
    security program. The data accurately reflect the extent of coverage of the
    State unemployment insurance laws and are used to measure UI revenues;
    national, State, and local area employment; and total and UI-taxable wage
    trends. The information is used as an input for actuarial studies,
    determination of employer UI tax experience ratings, and UI benefit levels.
    Research using QCEW data helps ensure the solvency of the unemployment
    insurance trust funds. The QCEW data also are used to compute State and
    national insured unemployment rates for workers covered by UI programs.</p>
    <p>The QCEW data also are important for a variety of other BLS programs. A
    quarterly file containing employer name and address information is created
    from QCEW administrative records of UI-covered employers, and serves as a
    sampling frame for BLS establishment-based surveys such as the National
    Compensation Survey, the Current Employment Statistics program, and the
    Occupational Employment Statistics survey. The data also serve, for example,
    as the basic source of benchmark information for employment by industry and
    by size of establishment in the Current Employment Statistics program, the
    Occupational Safety and Health Statistics survey, and the Occupational
    Employment Statistics survey.</p>

<h3><a name="2l">How to obtain publications and data</a></h3>
    <p>Prior editions of <em>Employment and Wages</em> are out of
    print, but file copies may be examined at the BLS Washington office and at
    Federal Depository Libraries. County-level and historical machine-readable
    data are available from the BLS Washington office. The charge for this
    service varies according to the complexity and volume of the request. Please
    request data by mail from the Office of Employment and Unemployment
    Statistics, Division of Administrative Statistics and Labor Turnover, Room
    4840, Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, Washington, DC
    20212. You may also contact us by <a href="http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/forms/cew?/cew/cewbultn.htm">email</a>;
    the telephone number is (202) 691-6567. The request should include the name
    and telephone number of an individual whom BLS may contact if necessary.</p>
    <p>Most State Employment Security Agencies have QCEW
    employment and wage data for both the private and government sectors by
    county and for major labor market areas. Requests for these detailed data
    should be made directly to State agencies (listed on the inside back cover
    of this publication). Data for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands also are
    available and may be obtained from the employment security agencies in those
    jurisdictions.</p>
