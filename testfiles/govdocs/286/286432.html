<P>This research is aimed at improving our ability to measure trace species in the atmosphere, with the goal of better understanding abundances, formation and loss mechanisms, and transport of ozone and particulate matter.  Research is continuing to measure atmospheric peroxides, using a novel instrument developed with previous DOE funding.  Peroxides are the termination products of HO<sub>2</sub> and RO<sub>2</sub> free radicals that are involved in ozone formation through reaction with NO<sub>x</sub>.  In addition, peroxides are important oxidants for atmospheric SO<sub>2</sub> in the aqueous phase, producing sulfates that ultimately may return to the atmosphere as particulate matter.  New methods are being developed for the analysis of HO<sub>2 </sub>and RO<sub>2</sub> free radicals, precursors to peroxides and to O<sub>3</sub>, and for SO<sub>2</sub> and NH<sub>3</sub>, which play a role in the formation of atmospheric aerosols.  The project continues a long-standing collaborative relationship between the PI and students from the State University of New York / College at Old Westbury and Brookhaven National Laboratory&#146;s Atmospheric Sciences Division.  New instruments will be field tested at BNL&#146;s mobile field station, and deployed at surface sites and aboard the DOE&#146;s G-1 research aircraft in field campaigns in collaboration with BNL, ANL and PNNL scientists.  The measurements are analyzed for trends and relationships with other trace gas species&#146; concentration, and will be made available to the modeling community.</P>
