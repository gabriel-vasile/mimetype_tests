</font></B><FONT FACE="Times">

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Infrared observations combined with 

  realistic laboratory simulations have revolutionized our understanding of interstellar 

  ice and dust, the building blocks of comets. Since comets are thought to be 

  an important source of the organics which seeded the early Earth, it is important 

  to understand the prebiotic chemistry these induced on the primitive Earth. 

  In The Astrochemistry Laboratory, we simulate interstellar and cometary chemistry 

  and have shown that many complex organic species are readily formed from the 

  photochemistry of astrophysically-realistic ice mixtures. Since comets brought 

  these materials into the young Solar System, seeding the early Earth with their 

  complex organic inventory, an important question these results raise is, &quot;Have 

  comets provided important raw materials from which life started on Earth?&quot;</font></P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) is 

  one of the more intriguing molecules formed in our comet simulations. HMT has 

  been reported to form amino acids in water solution, and amino acids are considered 

  crucial to life. However, the earlier research on HMT did not study the reaction 

  thoroughly nor did it examine the range of conditions relevant to the conditions 

  on the primitive Earth. A more thorough analysis under plausible prebiotic conditions 

  is necessary to understand whether the cometary input of HMT could have been 

  a critical source of amino acids for the origin of life or merely a minor contributor.</font></P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The project we propose is to study 

  the reactions of HMT under a variety of reasonable primitive terrestrial conditions, 

  seeking to fully identify the amino acids produced when HMT is placed in water 

  solutions and to understand the kinetics of various amino acid production routes.</font></P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The focus will be primarily on the 

  effect of temperature and pH in simulated early Earth "oceans" in order to extrapolate 

  the results to realistic scenarios of the primitive Earth. The student should 

  have an interest in chemistry, some laboratory experience, and some knowledge 

  of kinetics. Analytical techniques available include fluorescence HPLC, IR and 

  UV/Vis spectroscopy, and possibly NMR. The student will learn to become proficient 

  on these instruments. Thus, this project affords the opportunity for a student 

  to help answer an important astrobiological question as well as improve their 

  understanding of kinetics and gain valuable experience with several sophisticated 

  analytical techniques.</font></P>

  astrophysical data. The observations were recently made using the Hubble Space 

  Telescope (HST) and the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO). The interested student 

  would help with processing/analysis of these data. The observations are of the

  (PNs). PNs are part of the late-in-life evolution of most stars (including the 

  Sun someday). The HST observations are producing spectacular pictures of the 

  PNs for which we have ISO data. Some of the things we are trying to learn about 

  these astronomical objects include what chemical elements are present and in 

  what quantities. By studying young regions like the Orion Nebula and old ones 

  like the PNs, we are able to measure cosmic evolution of the elements. Abundant 

  elements in space are hydrogen, helium, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. With the 

  exception of helium, these are also the most interesting/important in terms 

  of the organic chemistry and astrobiology implications. As well as having an 

  interest in the above science, the student should be capable with computers. 

  Familiarity with UNIX will be helpful as we have Sun workstations and also access

<div align="left"></div>

<FONT FACE="Times">

<P align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">This project has to 

  do with the propagation of electrical currents through rocks such as basalts, 

  gabbros, and granites which are normally electrical insulators. It has recently 

  been discovered that even nominally anhydrous rocks pick up traces of water 

  while crystallizing in the H2O-laden Earth's crust or mantle. The water is incorporated 

  into mineral structures in form of hydroxyl groups, as Si-OH and Si-OH pairs. 

  During cooling, the SiOH pairs rearrange to form peroxy links, Si/OO\Si and 

  H2 molecules. The peroxy links are interesting in as much as they easily fall 

  apart, turning into an electronic charge, a defect electron or "hole". The rocks 

  then become instantly p-type semiconductors! When this occurs, they display 

  a range of unusual phenomena, which are both fun and a challenge to study. A 

  facinating aspect is that mechanical shock, such as that of an impact, splits 

  the peroxy links and allows the highly mobile holes to flow through the rock. 

  As they flow, they build up electric fields at the rock surface - so high that 

  plasma discharges occur. At the same time strange magnetic effects are observed. 

  These phenomena have a wide range of implications: the positive holes are highly 

  oxidizing, and interact with the environment of the rock. The geophysical aspect 

  comes in trying to understand why rock fracturing can lead to electrical and 

  magnetic phenomena in the ground which can be observed in the atmosphere and 

  even in the ionosphere prior to and during earthquakes. These phenomena have 

  been long reported, but never really understood. The impact-driven electricity 

  and magnetism have also the potential to teach us more about the anomalous magnetic 

  patterns on the moon and Mars, which are observed in the cratered highlands. 

  On Earth, where liquid water causes weathering, the peroxy in the rocks are 

  hydrolyzed to hydrogen peroxide, H<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB>. The earliest organism 

  would have had to develop a defense to this highly oxidizing agent. The project 

  involves measuring the generation of positive hole charge carriers in, and their 

  propagation through various rocks. Experiments are conducted with low-velocity 

  and medium velocity impacts at the Ames Vertical Gun Range, and fast, real-time 

  data acquisition, determining the propagation, the scattering and the lifetime 

  of the charge carriers in different rocks.</font></P>

  The Mars Wind Tunnel will be used to simulate effects of winds and resultant

  Mars Surveyor 2001 Lander. The Lander deck will include the following relevant 

  experiments: 1. a panoramic imaging system and emission spectrometer on a mast,

  called MECA, which will focus on microscopic examination and wet chemistry of 

  soil samples delivered to the experiment by a robotic arm and scoop; and 3. 

  MIP, an experiment which includes solar cells that can be rotated to remove 

  accumulated dust, determination of dust thickness by examining solar transmissive 

  losses, and a dust electrostatic repulsion experiment. Further, patch plates 

  on the deck for MECA and a Moessbauer calibration target will be on the deck. 

  Wind deposited dust and dust deposited onto the deck during delivery of samples 

  to MECA will strongly influence the calibration targets and the MIP experiments. 

  The Pancam and infrared spectrometer will be used to monitor these effects. 

  The intent of this task is to use the Mars Wind Tunnel and scale models of the

  under various wind regimes on Mars. The scale models will be supplied by R. 

  E. Arvidson, Washington University, a collaborator on the project. Working with

  an Egg Incubator for studies in early development, an Insect Habitat for multigenerational 

  and radiation studies, an Aquatic Habitat for fresh water and marine organisms, 

  and an Advanced Animal Habitat for rats and mice.</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Research Activity: 

  In the SSBRP Aquatic Laboratory we are conducting studies to better understand 

  the unique environmental conditions required to maintain aquatic research models 

  in space. We are focusing specifically on the zebrafish, <I>Danio rerio</I>, 

  because of its many important contributions to the areas of developmental biology, 

  neurobiology, and molecular genetics. Experiments aboard the ISS are expected 

  to include exposure to hypergravity conditions utilizing the large 2.8 m Centrifuge 

  Facility. However, it is not known how aquatic research models, such as the 

  zebrafish, will respond to gravity forces greater than 1-g. A gas-filled swimbladder, 

  equivalent to approximately 5-7% of body volume in freshwater, is required by 

  fish to counteract their density (~ 1.06 g/ml) and achieve neutral buoyancy. 

  Fish will need to increase this volume proportionally with increased gravitational 

  forces to maintain neutral buoyancy, normal posture, feeding behavior, and spawning 

  behavior. This study will expose larval and adult zebrafish to hypergravity 

  conditions induced by centrifugation. Behavior will be monitored by video to 

  examine buoyancy changes, posture, feeding behavior, and whether the air-water 

  interface is used for swimbladder volume regulation. Post-exposure analysis 

  will quantify the extent of swimbladder volume. The student will be able to 

  participate in all stages of the study including the design of the experimental 

  system for centrifugation, data collection, statistical analysis, and the preparation 

  of written reports. </font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Research Goal: Our 

  objective is to quantify changes in swimbladder volume and whole-body buoyancy 

  regulation in zebrafish following exposure to hypergravity conditions and upon 

  return to a 1-g environment. These responses will be used to predict the behavior 

  of experimental fish aboard the ISS and the limits of hypergravity to which 

  they can be exposed. </font></P>

  Studies of Altered Gravitational Effects on Human ANS <B>and CNS Function</b>.</font></P>

</B> 

<P align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Adaptation is defined 

  as "modification of an organism or its parts that makes it more fit for existence 

  under conditions of it's environment". Perhaps individual differences in the 

  ability to adapt to microgravity are related to differences in autonomic plasticity. 

  Autonomic neural plasticity is a term that describes the capability of organisms 

  to modify ANS function through learning. Psychophysiology is the study of the 

  relationship between behavior and physiology.</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The purpose of this 

  research is to address the NASA requirement for ground-based studies examining 

  vestibular/autonomic interaction as related to adaptation to microgravity and 

  readaptation to Earth. The primary goals of this work are to (i) understand 

  the mechanisms by which behavioral (Autogenic Feedback Training Exercise AFTE 

  - an autonomic conditioning procedure), and pharmacological countermeasures 

  (e.g., scopolamine, promethazine and phenytoin) improve tolerance to motion 

  and space motion sickness, and (ii) determine the treatment method most likely 

  to be effective for facilitating adaptation to microgravity and re-adaptation 

  to Earth with minimal side-effects. Through AFTE it may be possible to learn 

  more about the influence of CNS (or cognitive) activity on other space flight 

  related biomedical problems as well, such as post-flight orthostatic intolerance. 

  This research also uses NASA technology to investigate other environments that 

  induce motion sickness, such as military vehicles. By understanding individual 

  differences in ANS function when exposed to altered gravity and other environments 

  causing motion sickness, we may be better able to develop and evaluate countermeasures 

  needed to facilitate adaptation.</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Long term exposure 

  to a zero-G environment causes many physiological changes in humans. In particular 

  are the loss of bone and muscle mass. These losses pose a serious problem when 

  considering manned space flight to Mars or other extended space missions. This 

  project seeks to better understand the relationship between strain placed on 

  bones in normal gravity and the molecular signal that tells bone to grow. There 

  is surprisingly little data on this topic. Advancements in our knowledge of 

  the mechanisms of bone loss are aimed toward developing prophylactic therapies 

  for future astronauts. During the course of the summer the student will learn 

  various laboratory techniques, such as strain gauge implantation surgery, hindlimb 

  suspension of rodents (simulating a lack of gravity) and basic histomorphometry. 

  The applications of this research are not limited to manned space flight, but 

  also have implications for future studies of osteoporosis, sports medicine, 

  and orthopedic surgery.</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Background: Much remains 

  to be learned about how plants respond to gravitational inputs. Since growing 

  plants in microgravity is important for future space habitation, growing plants 

  in hypergravity is interesting in that the results obtained may possibly be 

  extrapolated to make predictions about plant reactions to microgravity. Also, 

  the hypergravity environment can be created on Earth and thus experiments using 

  hypergravity are much less expensive as well as easier to conduct. Ames Research 

  Center has outstanding centrifuge facilities available for life science research. 

  Plant hypergravity research, examining both the gross morphological and cell 

  biological effects, will provide direction for future plant gravitational research.</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Research Activity: 

  The Astrobiology Academy student will participate in an experiment growing seedlings 

  on a centrifuge under hypergravity conditions. Results will be analyzed using 

  time-lapse video taken during the experiment, as set up by the student. Imaging 

  will also be used in the analysis of plants at the conclusion of the growth 

  experiment. Image measurements of plant growth will lead toward conclusions 

  about how altered gravity quantitatively affects growing plants.<br>

  Mars Gravity</font></P>

</B> 

<P align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">When astronauts abruptly 

  cross the boundary between disparate gravitational (g) environments, their posture, 

  locomotion, and other bodily movements are severely disrupted. Anecdotal reports 

  and observations of shuttle astronauts reveal unintentional collisions with 

  walls, sudden attacks of vertigo and unsteadiness, and poor hand-eye coordination. 

  Astronauts' inability to engage in rapid and accurate visual-motor coordination, 

  together with their problems of balance, could easily result in tragedy during 

  emergency situations that might occur just as their spacecraft undergoes orbital 

  insertion, arrives at the surface of the Moon or Mars, or touches back down 

  on Earth. At the very least, these problems could cause significant loss of 

  productivity, especially on relatively short missions. Thus, any method of adapting 

  astronauts to these atypical g environments <I>before actually entering them</I> 

  (referred to as "preflight adaptation training") should contribute substantially 

  to astronaut safety and efficiency. </font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Our project involves 

  the simulation of both the visual and the bodily sensations of walking in the 

  .38-g conditions of Mars (and other gravitational environments). This simulation 

  is accomplished by placing the lower half of the subject&#146;s body in a lower 

  body positive pressure (LBPP) device and having him/her walk on a treadmill 

  while viewing a computer-generated virtual Mars valley through which he/she 

  is walking. Studies will be done first to perfect this Mars gravity simulator 

  and then to demonstrate that subjects are capable of adapting to the simulation 

  while maintaining their normal ability to walk in Earth gravity (1.0 g), a necessary 

  characteristic of any successful form of preflight adaptation training.</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The duties of an Astrobiology 

  Academy student would include testing human subjects, placing data in an electronic 

  spreadsheet, and analyzing them by means of the appropriate statistical programs. 

  He/she would also be expected to attend weekly research meetings at which will 

  be discussed research results, problems that may have arisen, etc. The candidate 

  should be able to type well and have had experience with Macintosh computers
