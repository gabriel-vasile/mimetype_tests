			<b>A Note from the IGAC Chair: Guy Brasseur</b>
			
			<P>Over recent decades, the atmospheric chemistry community has
            devoted great effort to quantify the gas phase processes that
            control the formation and destruction of photooxidants in the
            troposphere. The focus has been on ozone and hydroxyl radical
            formation and destruction, with emphasis on the role played by
            precursors such as the nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, methane
            and nonmethane hydrocarbons. This approach has highlighted the
            importance of biogenic emissions from oceans, soils, and vegetation
            (including biomass burning), as well as anthropogenic perturbations.</P>

            <P>More recently, it has become evident that atmospheric aerosols
            could affect the processes that control the budget of photooxidants.
            Several studies have shown, for example, that conversion of nitrogen
            oxides into nitric acid on sulfate aerosols could be a very efficient
            mechanism, especially during nighttime. Other mechanisms affecting
            ozone and other photooxidants in the troposphere have been proposed,
            including the uptake of peroxy radicals on sulfate particles,
            the destruction of ozone on soot particles, the release of active
            forms of halogens from seasalt, and the heterogeneous formation
            of nitrous acid in highly polluted areas. The role of such multiphase
            reactions remains controversial, making them deserving of considerable
            attention.</P>

            <P>It is clear today that the simple representation of sulfate
            aerosols in global and regional models has become insufficient
            to account for important chemical and climate effects. Modern
            approaches must consider the effects not only of sulfate and
            nitrate aerosols, but also of mineral dust, soot, organic particles,
            sea-salt, and probably other types of particles. Challenging
            work to measure the chemical composition of particles in the
            boundary layer and in the free troposphere is underway, often
            under IGAC sponsorship. More detailed representations of aerosols
            are being implemented in the most advanced models, including
            climate models.</P>

            <P>The present issue of IGACtivities focuses on microphysical
            processes that lead to the formation of new particles in the
            atmosphere. Several studies sponsored by the European Commission
            are summarized that have been conducted to understand nucleation
            processes in different environments. New and exciting science
            has resulted from these studies.<br><br>
