      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Charting the History of 

        Earthís Earliest Microbial Ecosystems</b> <br>

        Principal Investigator: David Des Marais </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Microorganisms are the primary 

        engines of our biosphere, and so they play major roles in the biogeochemical 

        cycles of carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur and metals. The hierarchical 

        organization of microbial ecosystems determines the rates of processes 

        that shape Earthís environment, create the sedimentary and atmospheric 

        signatures (biomarkers) of life, and define the stage upon which major 

        evolutionary events occurred. To learn how microbes fulfill these roles 

        on Earth and, potentially, other worlds, we must therefore understand 

        the structure and function of microbial ecosystems. Photosynthetic microbial 

        mats have been major players for billions of years. They are self-sustaining, 

        complete ecosystems in which light energy that is absorbed over part of 

        a diel (24 hour) cycle drives the synthesis of spatially-organized, diverse 

        biomass. Thus mats offer an opportunity to study how microbial populations 

        associate to control the biogeochemical cycles. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This project involves experiments 

        with cyanobacterial microbial mats maintained in a simulated natural environment. 

        We will explore various conditions that represent stages in the long-term 

        (billion year) evolution of our environment. The effects of seawater composition, 

        oxygen and dissolved inorganic carbon contents will be measured for ecosystem 

        properties such as population sizes, elemental cycling and gas production. 

        We will seek a better understanding of how the environment influences 

        biomarkers such as atmospheric gases and also chemicals and minerals preserved 

        in sedimentary rocks. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The student will participate 

        in experiments with microbial mats as part of a team. He/she will measure 

        the production and consumption of oxygen and carbon compounds using microelectrodes 

        and chromatographs. These measurements will be compiled and interpreted 

        as rates of ecosystem processes. The student will thereby contribute to 

        an improved understanding of how ancient photosynthetic ecosystems interacted 

        with changing environments and recorded their legacy. Coursework in chemistry 

        and/or biology, and a working knowledge of word processing and spreadsheets, 

        is necesssary. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Detecting Microbial Activity 

        in Microbes</b> <br>

        Principle Investigator: David P. Summers </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One question of interest in 

        the study of microbes from old samples, considering transit of materials 

        between planets, and general studies of microbes in extreme environments 

        is how long microbes can remain viable when they are dormant. Are the 

        totally dormant? Or can they, under some conditions (such as frozen in 

        ice) undergo any repair of damage they occur while dormat? This project 

        seeks to invesigate the lower limits of metabolic activity. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The proceedure is to take tyrosine 

        that has been radiolabeled with 125 I and feed it to microbes to test 

        their metabolic activity. Any radiolabel taken up can then be measure 

        by MultiPhoton Detection, a technique that allows the detection of radioiodine 

        at below background levels. This work would involve handling microbes, 

        preparation of radiolabled materials, measurement of labelling, and possibly 

        techniques such as protein gels. A candidate ideally should have a background 

        in biological or chemical work and be willing to work radioisotopes. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Advanced Animal Habitat-Centrifuge 

        Project</b> <br>

        Principle Investigator: Paul Espinosa </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Astronauts who have been exposed 

        to long periods of microgravity have experienced harmful physiological 

        effects. To develop countermeasures, NASA must conduct studies to improve 

        understanding of how bones and muscles change in space and after return 

        to Earth, and how hormones and the immune system respond to long exposure 

        to microgravity. Because of the similarity of animal and human physiological 

        systems, the most effective way to obtain large amounts of data is by 

        using animals and fly them in microgravity. The Space Station Biological 

        Research Project (SSBRP) has contracted out the development of the Advanced 

        Animal Habitat-Centrifuge (AAH-C) to fly rats and mice on the International 

        Space Station (ISS) beginning in 2005. The AAH-C will allow both scientists 

        on Earth and astronauts in space to view the animals and monitor their 

        physiology and behavior while the rodents live in space. The rodents will 

        be exposed to microgravity conditions or to different levels of artificial 

        gravity created when the hardware is attached to the Space Stationís centrifuge. 

        In addition to acting as a scientific instrument, the habitat must include 

        all the basic facilities to support the animals for up to 90 days onboard 

        the ISS. These habitats can also be attached to an on-orbit glovebox allowing 

        astronauts to reach into the cages to retrieve animals and perform experiments. 

        </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although this habitat sounds 

        rather simple to develop, it is in face very complicated requiring highly 

        skilled engineers, and scientists to develop. Each habitat which can house 

        up to 6 rats or 12 mice must be able to support the rodents on the station 

        for up to 90 days. The habitats must provide air, water, food, waste management, 

        light and dark cycles and temperature control for the rodents. It must 

        also contain all waste and odors generated inside the cage and meet the 

        stringent hardware fabrication requirements imposed by the space station. 

        </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The contractor developing the 

        hardware is STAR Inc., located in Bloomington, Indiana with the support 

        of the prime sub-contractor SHOT Inc. in Floyd Knobs, Indiana. The development, 

        design, fabrication and testing of the hardware will be performed by the 

        contractors. The government (Ames Research Center) stipulates the requirements 

        for the hardware through various documents, monitors the hardware development 

        through daily contact with the contractor to make sure the governmentís 

        requirements are being met, maintains the contract, and provides technical 

        advice, review and concurrence on tasks to the contractor. Currently the 

        contractor is in the design phase of the project with a Critical Design 

        Review (drawings 90% complete) scheduled for 2002. The AAH-C project team 

        at Ames Research Center, consisting of the Project Manager and Engineer 

        with the support of other engineers and scientists, is currently supporting 

        the development of the hardware. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The student will be a member 

        of the NASA AAH-C project team and participate in the management of the 

        hardware development. The student will be assigned a specific task to 

        accomplish during the summer related to the project management aspect 

        of the hardware design. This could include validating the technical feasibility 

        and compliance to the specifications of a proposed aspect of the design, 

        researching the foundation of specific requirements and recommending changes 

        to the requirements to support problem design issues, performing tests 

        to validate the functionality and operationally of a specific design, 

        etc. They will be expected to attend weekly project meetings at which 

        will be discussed the development status, problems that may have arisen, 

        etc. and to work any actions which will be assigned to them. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This position is best suited 

        for an engineer or scientist in an undergraduate program currently attending 

        a university. The candidate should be able to type well and have had experience 

        with Macintosh computers and programs such as Word and Excel. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Hypergravity Effects on 

        the Maternal-Fetal System</b><br>

        Principal Investigator: April E. Ronca, Ph.D. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Life on earth, and thus the 

        reproductive and ontogenetic processes of all extant species and their 

        ancestors, evolved under the constant influence of the earthís 1-g gravitational 

        field. Opportunities to observe biological processes under gravitational 

        conditions that deviate from earth-normal are infrequent and have historically 

        been dedicated predominantly to understanding adult processes. Research 

        in my laboratory focuses on the role(s) of gravity in reproductive and 

        developmental processes in mammals with particular emphasis on effects 

        of increased (hyper-) and decreased (hypo-) gravity on pregnancy, birth 

        and the transition from prenatal to postnatal life. Studies of mammalian 

        development are dynamic and complex. The mother plays crucial roles in 

        offspring'sí development, providing necessary resources that promote and 

        foster growth and development. Offspring, in turn, provide stimulation 

        that helps maintain and regulate maternal responses. We focus on bi-directional 

        linkages within the maternal-offspring system and therefore, analyze the 

        effects of altering the gravitational field on both mothers and neonates. 

        Our approach is multidisciplinary, performing integrative analyses in 

        conjunction with other laboratories at Ames and several universities. 

        </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Astrobiology Academy student 

        will participate in a project in which intrauterine pressure will be monitored 

        in late pregnant female rats during hypergravity exposure using the Ames 

        24-ft centrifuge. We previously found that exposure to hypo- and hypergravity 

        alters the frequency of labor contractions in pregnant rats. The new project 

        will focus on concomitant changes in the force of contractions measured 

        by telemetric biosensors in addition to changes in maternal uterine connexin 

        proteins and in abdominal muscle. Correlated changes in neonatal neurodevelopmental 

        outcome will also be studied. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The duties of an Astrobiology 

        Academy student will include assisting in hypergravity experiments of 

        the pregnant rats and their offspring and conducting data analysis using 

        statistical programs. He/she would also be expected to attend weekly research 

        meetings to discuss research progress and results. Background in biology 

        and neuroscience and experience with general laboratory equipment is desirable. 

        </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Perception of Gravity</b> 

        <br>

        Principal Investigator: Robert Welch </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The commonsense view of the 

        relationship between human perception and motor actions is that we first 

        perceive our environment and then, and only then, are we able to act, 

        on the basis of this perceptual representation. However, recent exciting 

        neuropsychological research with both brain-damaged and brain-intact individuals 

        contradicts this view. These data suggest instead that perception and 

        action are parallel processes. Thus it may be that perception and action 

        can be quite different from each other. Evidence for such so-called perception-action 

        dissociation for normal (i.e., brain-intact) observers comes from studies 

        in which it has been shown that, despite the presence of a strong visual 

        illusion, subjectsí motor responses are perfectly accurate. Thus, it appears 

        possible for ìthe hand to know better than the eye.î If further evidence 

        confirms this conclusion, it would inspire a true paradigm shift from 

        the conventional view that perception must precede and guide action. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The proposed research will 

        systematically examine the perception-action dissociation hypothesis, 

        using strict research criteria to rule out alternative interpretations 

        of the data. In one study subjects will be confronted with a pitched visual 

        environment, which is already known from the Principal Investigatorís 

        own research to cause a very large shift in visually perceived eye level, 

        but only minor errors in pointing. This pattern of results must be examined 

        more carefully to determine if it is really an example of perception-action 

        dissociation as it appears to be. We will do this by delaying the subjectís 

        pointing responses. Previous research indicates that perception-action 

        dissociation that is found when observers act upon a stimulus that is 

        present in their visual field disappears, to be replaced by association, 

        when a delay is imposed between observing the stimulus and making the 

        motor response. If this is found in the proposed study, it will support 

        the conclusion that the incongruity between perceiving and pointing in 

        a pitched environment is, indeed, a case of perception-action dissociation. 

        </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The duties of an Astrobiology 

        Academy student will include testing human subjects, placing data in an 

        electronic spreadsheet, and analyzing them by means of the appropriate 

        statistical programs. He/she would also be expected to attend weekly research 

        meetings where research results, problems that may have arisen, etc will 

        be discussed. The candidate should be able to type well and have had experience

        of Neural Networks</b> <br>

        Principal Investigator: Dr. Richard Boyle </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The vestibular system is located 

        in the inner ear and is responsible for detecting forces due to gravitational 

        and angular acceleration, and translating these inputs into a neural signal 

        that is relayed to the central nervous system. It has been shown that 

        significant morphological and physiological changes take place in the 

        neural networks of the vestibular systems of rats and toadfish, respectively, 

        flown in microgravity, and it has been postulated that these neural networks 

        are ìrewiringî themselves to make up for the lower input signal coming 

        in from acceleration due to gravity.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 

        NASA Center for Bioinformatics develops and applies advanced technologies 

        to understanding neurophysiology and the response of the terrestrial organisms

        not only the adaptation of terrestrial organisms to space, but also to 

        understanding neural diseases, trauma, and aging afflicting people here 

        on Earth. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Astrobiology Academy Research 

        Associate would be able to choose from a wide variety of techniques and 

        tools to study several problems in neurophysiological responses to the 

        space environment. The project would involve either using existing data 

        and employing computer techniques such as modeling or 3D reconstruction, 

        or using more conventional methods such as electrophysiological techniques 

        or light and/or TEM microscopy . </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Training Microbes for Oxygen 

        </b><br>

        Principal Investigator: Friedemann Freund </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The early Earth atmosphere 

        probably did not contain free oxygen. Yet there is evidence that phylogenetically 

        ancient microbes already developed the enzymatic machinery to fend off 

        the lethal effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Such ROS are normally 

        associated with the presence of free oxygen in the environment. This project 

        pursues the question whether common igneous rocks such as granite may 

        have been the training ground for early microbes, forcing them to adjust 

        to the presence of ROS in their immediate environment. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Underlying this approach is 

        the recognition that many, if not all rocks that crystallized from magmas 

        contain an unusual form of oxygen in the crystal structures of their minerals. 

        This form of oxygen is known as peroxy. Peroxy forms when, during crystallization 

        from a fluid-laden magma, minerals incorporate small amount of ìwaterî. 

        At first this dissolved ìwaterî forms hydroxyl anions, but during cooling 

        pairs of the hydroxyl anions rearrange in such a way as to split off molecular 

        hydrogen and oxidizing oxygen anions to the peroxy state. When such rocks 

        become exposed to the surface and weathering sets in, the peroxy hydrolyze 

        to hydrogen peroxide. Any microbes living in intimate contact with rock 

        surfaces would therefore have been constantly exposed to this powerful 

        oxidant and source of ROS. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As part of this Astrobiology 

        project we seek to characterize the surfaces of freshly crushed rocks 

        and look for ROS. We examine how microbes react, both aerobic and anaerobic 

        when brought in wet contact with rock powders. We study cell damage and 

        DNA damage, and the synthesis of shock proteins in response to the ROS 

        challenge. The project requires familiarity with basic principles of handling 

        microbial cultures and of conducting biochemical assays. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Background: Plants are at the 

        base of our food web, and they perform such essential tasks as revitalizing

        water. If long-term space habitation is ever to become feasible, plants 

        must play a key role in these extraterrestrial life support systems; however, 

        much remains to be learned about how plants adapt and respond to altered 

        gravitational conditions beyond the Earth. Growing plants in hypergravity 

        (on a slow-spinning centrifuge) is one approach that can allow us to make 

        predictions about plant adaptations to microgravity or the low-gravity 

        environments such as on the Moon and Mars. Also, the hypergravity environment 

        can be created easily on Earth and, thus, experiments using hypergravity 

        are much less expensive as well as easier to conduct than comparable spaceflight 

        experiments. NASA Ames Research Center maintains a suite of outstanding 

        centrifuge facilities available for life science research. Plant hypergravity 

        research, examining both the gross morphological and cell biological effects 

        of gravity on plants, will provide direction for future plant research 

        in space. These studies will also lay the groundwork in the development 

        of future bioregenerative life support systems for long term human habitation 

        of space. </font></p>

        Academy student will participate in an experiment growing seedlings on

        development and testing of existing image acquisition hardware and software 

        for remote-viewing of plants while growing on-board the centrifuge. Baseline 

        plant growth tests will be done to demonstrate the capabilities of the 

        remote imaging system. Then a quantitative study of plant growth and gravity 

        response will be performed by the student to answer a specific scientific 

        question. Plant growth will be analyzed using time-lapse video taken during 

        the experiment. Microscopy imaging will also be used in the analysis of 

        plants at the conclusion of the growth experiment. Image measurements 

        of plant growth will lead toward conclusions about how altered gravity 

        quantitatively affects growing plants. </font></p>

        Principle Investigator: David P. Summers </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One of the prerequisites for 

        the origin is life is a source of reduced carbon and nitrogen containing 

        compounds from which to make such compounds as amino acids. This research 

        centers around some of the earliest reactions involved in the origin of 

        life. Reactions which occurred in the period before the first universal 

        ancestor of modern life appeared but after the Earth had cooled enough 

        to allow liquid water and was no longer being sterilized by large impacts. 

        Specifically, studies address an early Earth with a carbon dioxide and 

        nitrogen atmosphere and consider how the reduced carbon and nitrogen molecules 

        that made up the "prebiotic soup" might have been formed. Research is 

        conducted by postulating what reactions might have caused this to happen, 

        seeing if they will run in the lab under conditions that might have existed 

        back then, measuring how fast the reactions will go, and using kinetic 

        models to determine how important those reactions would have been on the 

        early Earth. Work also involves how such reactions may have produced reactions 

        that are isotopically enriched or depleted in certain isotopes. Such isotope 

        fractionation is considered a marker of biological activity, but controls 

        from abiological reactions are lacking. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The reduction/fixation work 

        on this project involves running reactions and measuring the amounts and/or 

        rates of product formation. The isotope fractionation involved running 

        reactions and separating out the products for submission to collaborators 

        for analysis. These experiments are conducted over a variety of conditions 

        such a may have existed on the early Earth. </font></p>

        Place ñ from inside Magmatic Minerals </b><br>

        Principal Investigator: Friedemann Freund </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many reaction pathways are 

        known by which organic molecules can be synthesized under conditions that 

        simulate those of the prebiotic Earth. Many such reactions take place 

        in the atmosphere or in the water or at gas-mineral or water-mineral interfaces. 

        Some such reactions also occur in the ìsoftî matrix of water ice or between 

        the weakly bound sheets of layer minerals such as clays. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One reaction medium, however, 

        has remained virtually unexplored: the dense, hard matrix of minerals. 

        This project addresses the question how delicate organic molecules can 

        be pre-assemble in the seemingly ìimpossibleî environment of minerals 

        that crystallize from magmas. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In this case the lowñz, biogenic 

        elements C, H and N derive from water, carbon dioxide and nitrogen ñ gases 

        that are present in all geological environments. Whenever minerals crystallize 

        from fluid-laden magmas, they incorporate small amounts of these gases 

        into their crystal structures. During cooling solid state processes get 

        underway that convert dissolved water into reduced H, dissolved carbon 

        dioxide into reduced C, and dissolved nitrogen into reduced N, while oxide 

        anions are oxidized to the peroxy state. Later C-C, C-H and C-N bonds 

        begin to form through segregation, causing complex ìorganicsî to be pre-assembled 

        at defects in the mineral structure. This sequence of events, represents 

        a route to synthesize biochemically relevant organics on the early Earth. 

        The Astrobiology project involves a infrared spectroscopic study of the 

        C-H entities that form inside such minerals as well as the extraction 

        and characterization of the organics using state-of-the-art analytical 

        techniques. It requires familiarity with basic principles of solid state

        star brightness will decrease for a period of a few hours. The fractional 

        reduction in the stellar flux provides the size of the planet relative 

        to that of the star. The orbital period is determined from the time between 

        transits. However many types of phenomena are also observed that serve 

        to confuse the results. These include variable stars, aircraft passing

        on Mars</b> <br>

        Principal Investigator: Nathalie A. Cabrol </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Water is a pre-requisite for 

        life as we know it on Earth. It has been demonstrated that Mars experienced 

        abundant hydrological activity in the past, and that the planet's conditions 

        were somewhat comparable to that of Earth at the beginning of its history. 

        From these observations, it was suggested that Mars might have developed 

        early environments favorable to the inception and the development of life, 

        but as the conditions changed (thinner atmosphere, surface UV bombardment, 

        decline of the hydrosphere) the survival of life at the surface was deemed 

        unlikely. Current theories predict that fossils could be found at depth, 

        and if extant life is to be discovered, it will in the subsurface. The 

        evidence for recent lakes, recent volcanic activity, and the discovery 

        of gullies and alluvial fans that could be recent or even current is suggesting 

        that Mars is more active than predicted after the Viking mission, implying 

        that we might have to revisit past theories and models. The presence of 

        water and heat are fundamental for the survival of living organisms. If 

        both are still present on Mars, there is a chance that life survived --if 

        it appeared-- These discoveries need to be confirmed by more observations 

        and modeling. If confirmed this new vision of Mars is of the utmost importance 

        for the search of life, for the design of exploration strategy, and for 

        the selection of candidate-landing sites. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our project involves the documentation 

        of this new vision of a hydrologically active Mars in current conditions 

        and its consequences in terms of potential current environments for life. 

        More evidence needs to be found in the Mars Global Surveyor data. Because 

        of the MOC imagery resolution and precision of the MOLA altimetry, it 

        is possible to perform accurate hydrogeological modeling that will tell 

        us, for instance, what are the discharges and volumes of sediment involved, 

        and what is the depth of the groundwater reservoir. These are critical 

        parameters to define in order to obtain a better picture of what are potentially 

        the current resources for living organisms. The student will participate 

        in this reconstruction of the current Mars hydrological activity by collaborating 

        in the search for new evidence. He/she will have access to the MGS data 

        archive, extract relevant images, altimetric and spectral data, and process 

        them. A training in image interpretation and processing will be given 

        to the student. As the 2003 mission to Mars involves two rovers, her/his 

        work will provide important information to designate high-priority regions 

        to explore. The student work will include a documentation of the most 

        favorable regions he/she identified, and the development of exploration 

        strategies relevant to the identified environments. </font></p>
