           STATE SINCE 1959. I GREW UP IN A TERRITORY. WE HAD TAXATION
           WITHOUT REPRESENTATION. MY FATHER USED TO SAY, HE FELT GOOD
           ABOUT BEING ABLE TO WRITE ON HIS INCOME TAX FORM IN A
           
           RED PEN, "FILED UNDER PROTEST: TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION
           REPRESENTATION." BUT THAT'S THE EXTENT OF WHAT MADE HIM FEEL
