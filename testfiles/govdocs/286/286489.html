           AMENDMENTS. WITH TWO MEMBERS ON ONE SIDE OF THE AISLE HAVING
           100 AMENDMENTS, JUST TWO SENATORS HAVE 100 AMENDMENTS THAT ARE
           PENDING. I MUST SAY ON OUR SIDE OF THE AISLE THERE ARE 75.
           THAT'S RIDICULOUS. WE NEED TO IDENTIFY THE ONES THAT WE ARE
           GOING TO OFFER NOW AND WE NEED COOPERATION IN ORDER TO GET THAT
           DONE. WE HAVE BEEN CONSIDERING THE BILL REALLY SINCE THE LAST
           SESSION. EVERYBODY HAS HAD A CHANCE IN THE COMMITTEE, LAST YEAR

           WE SPENT ABOUT TWO WEEKS TALKING ABOUT IT. WE HAD FOUR CLOTURE
           VOTES. WE HAVE HAD A TOTAL OF 14 DAYS ON IT. NOW THERE ARE
           SEVERAL OTHER ISSUES THAT ARE IMPORTANT THAT WE ARE GOING TO
           HAVE COME UP, AND WE WILL VOTE ON. BUT I THINK NOW WE NEED TO
           GET SERIOUS ABOUT BRINGING IT TO A CONCLUSION AND AFTER LOOKING
           AT THE LIST OF AMENDMENTS, AND CONSULTING WITH THE DEMOCRATIC
           LEADER I DO THINK WE NEED TO GO AHEAD AND GET A CLOTURE VOTE SO
           THAT WE CAN ELIMINATE THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE NOT RELATE TODAY
