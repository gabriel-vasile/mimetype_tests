<P>ON PETITION FOR A WRIT OF CERTIORARI <BR>
TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS<BR>
FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT</P>

<P>BRIEF FOR THE UNITED STATES IN OPPOSITION</P>

<P>OPINIONS BELOW</P>

<P>The opinion of the en banc court of appeals (Pet. App. 1a-81a) is reported
at 417 F.3d 145. The panel opinion of the court of appeals (Pet. App. 88a-101a)
is reported at 386 F.3d 313. The opinion of the district court (Pet. App.
102a-110a) is reported at 331 F. Supp. 2d 76.</P>

<P>JURISDICTION</P>

<P>The judgment of the court of appeals was entered on August 3, 2005. The
petition for a writ of certiorari was filed on October 29, 2005. The jurisdiction
of this Court is invoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1).</P>

<P>STATEMENT</P>

<P>1. Petitioners are United States citizens residing in the Commonwealth
of Puerto Rico, who desire to vote in</P>

<P>elections for the President and Vice President of the United States.
This is the third action brought within the last 12 years in which citizens
of Puerto Rico, led by pro se plaintiff and counsel Gregorio Igartua de
la Rosa, contend that the United States Constitution and interna tional
agreements entitle citizens of Puerto Rico to vote in presidential elections.</P>

<P>a. In Igartua de la Rosa v. United States, 32 F.3d 8 (1st Cir. 1994)
(per curiam) (Igartua I), cert. denied, 514 U.S. 1049 (1995), a group of
citizens residing in Puerto Rico-including two of the petitioners in the
instant case-brought an action asserting that the Constitution and various
international instruments afforded them the right to participate in presidential
elections. The court of appeals &quot;summarily&quot; rejected the contention
that the &quot;inability to vote in the United States presidential elec
tion violates their constitutional rights.&quot; 32 F.3d at 9. As the court
explained, the Constitution itself expressly &quot;provides that the President
is to be chosen by electors who, in turn, are chosen by 'each state . .
. in such man ner as the Legislature thereof may direct.'&quot; Ibid. (quot
ing U.S. Const. Art. II, &sect; 1, Cl. 2 (emphasis and ellipses added in
Igartua I)). Accordingly, &quot;the Constitution does not grant citizens
the right to vote directly for the President,&quot; and &quot;only citizens
residing in states can vote for electors and thereby indirectly for the
President.&quot; Ibid. Because Puerto Rico is not a State, the court held,
&quot;it is not entitled under Article II to choose electors for President,
and residents of Puerto Rico have no consti tutional right to participate
in that election.&quot; Id. at 9-10.</P>

<P>The Igartua I court further explained that no consti tutional amendment
provides for citizens of Puerto Rico to vote in a presidential election.
Instead, &quot;[t]he only jurisdiction, not a state, which participates
in the presi dential election is the District of Columbia, which ob tained
the right through the twenty-third amendment to the Constitution.&quot;
32 F.3d at 10. Accordingly, &quot;[o]nly a similar constitutional amendment
or a grant of state hood to Puerto Rico&quot; could provide its citizens
&quot;the right to vote in the presidential election.&quot; Ibid.</P>

<P>Finally, the court of appeals held that the Interna tional Covenant on
Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) does not entitle citizens of Puerto Rico
to vote in presi dential elections. As the Court explained, the substan
tive provisions of the ICCPR &quot;were not self-exe cuting * * * and could
not therefore give rise to pri vately enforceable rights under United States
law&quot; and, in any event, the ICCPR could not &quot;override the consti
tutional limits&quot; set forth in Article II. Iguarta I, 32 F.3d at 10
n.1.</P>

<P>b. In 2000, another group of citizens residing in Puerto Rico-including
four of the petitioners in the instant case-filed a second action alleging
that the Con stitution and the ICCPR entitle citizens of Puerto Rico to
vote in presidential elections. In Igartua de la Rosa v. United States,
229 F.3d 80 (1st Cir. 2000) (per curiam) (Igartua II), the court of appeals
once again rejected those contentions. The court explained that Igartua
I had &quot;held with undeniable clarity that the Constitution of the United
States does not confer upon United States citizens residing in Puerto Rico
a right to participate in the national election for President and Vice-President.&quot;
Id. at 83. The court further explained that, under set tled principles of
stare decisis, &quot;our decision in Igartua I controls this case, unless
there has been intervening controlling or compelling authority.&quot; Id.
at 84. The court concluded that no post-1994 decisions had under cut Igartua
I, and it therefore applied that &quot;binding au thority&quot; to order
the dismissal of Igartua II. See id. at 84-85.</P>

<P>Judge Torruella joined the per curiam opinion in Igartua II, but also
filed a separate concurrence. The concurrence urged at some length that
disparate treat ment of citizens of Puerto Rico was unfair and could warrant
&quot;judicial intervention at some point.&quot; 229 F.3d at 89 (concurring
opinion); see id. at 85-90. Nonethe less, the concurring opinion concluded
that Igartua II was not an &quot;appropriate case for such intervention,
largely because the particular issue of the presidential vote is governed
by explicit language in the Constitution providing for the election of the
President and Vice- President by the States, rather than by individual citi
zens.&quot; Id. at 90.</P>

<P>2. Undaunted by Igartua I and Igartua II, Mr. Igartua de la Rosa and
others filed a third, essentially identical lawsuit in August 2003. As in
the previous cases, petitioners alleged that citizens of Puerto Rico have
a right to vote in presidential elections under the Constitution (C.A. App.
1, 15-17, 50-51) and under inter national instruments such as the ICCPR
(id. at 34-40).</P>

<P>The district court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim.
With respect to the constitutional claims, the court found &quot;no new
jurisprudence warrant ing departure from prior clear, applicable precedent.
Nor is there new legislation * * * which would require the court to disregard
Igartua I and Igartua II.&quot; Pet. App. 106a. The court similarly found
dispositive the previous holding in Igartua I that treaties or other in
ternational agreements, even if privately enforceable, &quot;could not 'override
the constitutional limits' imposed by Art. II&quot; of the Constitution.
Ibid. (quoting 32 F.3d at 10 n.1).</P>

<P>3. a. On appeal, a panel of the court of appeals af firmed. Pet. App.
88a-90a. The majority held that the prior decisions in Igartua I and Igartua
II controlled, and that petitioners had not raised any arguments that warranted
departure from the rule that earlier decisions are binding.</P>

<P>Judge Torruella dissented. Pet. App. 91a-101a. Complaining of the &quot;colonial
nature of the U.S.-Puerto Rico relationship&quot; and of the &quot;doctrine
of inequality&quot; created by past Supreme Court decisions (id. at 93a-
94a), the dissent asserted that &quot;[t]he indefinite disen franchisement
of the United States citizens residing in Puerto Rico constitutes a gross
violation of their civil rights as guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment and
by international treaties to which our Nation is a signa tory.&quot; Id.
at 96a.</P>

<P>b. The court of appeals' panel thereafter granted rehearing, ordering
the parties to submit supplemental briefs addressing two questions: (1)
the effect of &quot;treaty obligations&quot; of the United States on the
eligibility of citizens residing in Puerto Rico to vote for President and
Vice-President of the United States; and (2) the avail ability of relief
under the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. 2201. See Pet. App. 82a-83a.
Prior to re-argu ment before the panel, however, the full court of appeals
voted to hear the case en banc. Ibid.</P>

<P>4. a. The en banc court of appeals affirmed the dis missal of petitioners'
complaint. Pet. App. 1a-11a. The court noted that the constitutional claim
is &quot;readily an swered&quot; by the text of the Constitution itself,
which vests the election of the President and Vice President in the States
rather than the citizens. Id. at 3a. The court concluded: &quot;Like each
state's entitlement to two Sena tors regardless of population, the make-up
of the elec toral college is a direct consequence of how the framers of
the Constitution chose to structure our govern ment-a choice itself based
on political compromise rather than conceptual perfection.&quot; Id. at
4a. Thus, vesting the franchise in States rather than citizens &quot;can
not be 'unconstitutional' because it is what the Constitu tion itself provides.&quot;
Ibid. Noting that petitioners' con stitutional claim had been rejected three
times by the court of appeals, the court stated: &quot;In this en banc deci
sion, we now put this constitutional claim fully at rest: it not only is
unsupported by the Constitution but is con trary to its provisions.&quot;
Id. at 5a.</P>

<P>The en banc court of appeals also held that petition ers' reliance upon
three international instruments - the ICCPR, the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights, and the Inter-American Democratic Charter-did not warrant
relief. The court observed that &quot;[n]o treaty claim, even if entertained,
would permit a court to order the electoral college to be enlarged or reapportioned,&quot;
since &quot;neither a statute nor a treaty can override the Constitution.&quot;
Pet. App. 5a-6a.</P>

<P>The court of appeals also rejected petitioners' efforts to recast the
claim as one seeking declaratory (rather than injunctive) relief, identifying
&quot;a host of problems with the treaty claim, including personal standing,
redressability, the existence of a cause of action, and the merits of the
treaty interpretations offered.&quot; Pet. App. 6a. The court found it &quot;unnecessary
to plumb these questions, * * * because none of these treaties com prises
domestic law of the United States and so their status furnishes the clearest
ground for denying declar atory relief.&quot; Id. at 7a. The court held
that the interna tional instruments cited by petitioners &quot;do not adopt
any legal obligations binding as a matter of domestic law,&quot; noting
that the Universal Declaration and the Inter- American Democratic Charter
are merely &quot;precatory,&quot; and the ICCPR is not self-executing. Id.
at 8a-9a. To declare that the United States was in violation of these provisions
&quot;would attempt to do what the President and Congress have declined
to do, namely, to deploy the treaty provision in an attempt to order domestic
ar rangements within the United States.&quot; Id. at 9a.</P>

<P>Finally, the court of appeals rejected the contention that &quot;customary
international law&quot; requires a declara tion concerning the right of
Puerto Rico residents to vote in presidential elections. Noting the different
methods by which democratic nations choose their lead ers, the court concluded:
&quot;If there exists an interna tional norm of democratic government, it
is at a level of generality so high as to be unsuitable for importation
into domestic law.&quot; Pet. App. 11a.</P>

<P>b. Judge Lipez concurred in the judgment. Pet. App. 13a-22a. The concurring
opinion would not have reached the merits of petitioners' claim for declaratory
relief, concluding that the court lacked jurisdiction over the claim because
it is not redressable by the court. Id. at 13a-14a. The concurring opinion
explained that &quot;there is only hope and speculation that Congress, in
response to a declaratory judgment about a violation of international law,
would invoke cumbersome and conten tious processes relating to Constitutional
amendment or the admission of a new state to eventually give citizen residents
of Puerto Rico the right to vote for President and Vice President. Such
hope and speculation does not satisfy the 'case or controversy' requirement
of Article III.&quot; Id. at 22a.</P>

<P>c. Judge Campbell issued a short concurring opinion (Pet. App. 12a) agreeing
with the concurrence of Judge Lipez that the court lacked jurisdiction to
grant declara tory relief. He also agreed with the majority's &quot;alterna
tive analysis which leads to the same outcome.&quot; Ibid.</P>

<P>d. Judge Torruella dissented. Pet. App. 23a-66a. In a lengthy opinion
recounting the political and legal his tory of Puerto Rico, Judge Torruella
asserted that the right to vote is fundamental and that, even if interna
tional legal instruments are not self-executing and do not create private
rights, the court should enter a de claratory judgment stating that the
United States has not taken any steps to comply with those international
instruments. See id. at 25a-66a.</P>

<P>e. Judge Howard also dissented. Pet. App. 66a-81a. He asserted that the
case should be remanded to permit the parties to develop a record concerning
whether the ICCPR is self-executing. Id. at 80a-81a.</P>

<P>ARGUMENT</P>

<P>The court of appeals held that the Constitution does not confer upon
U.S. citizens residing in Puerto Rico the right to participate in presidential
elections and that the courts lack the authority to enter a declaratory
judg ment stating that the United States has violated various international
instruments in failing to provide for such a right. That decision is amply
supported by constitu tional text, unbroken tradition, and uniform precedent.
Moreover, the court of appeals' decision does not create a conflict in the
circuits. Accordingly, review by this Court is unwarranted.</P>

<P>1. a. The Constitution expressly provides for the President to be elected
through a vote of presidential electors chosen by the States. In pertinent
part, Article II states: &quot;Each State shall appoint, in such Manner
as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Elec tors, equal to the
whole Number of Senators and Repre sentatives to which the State may be
entitled in the Con gress.&quot; Art. II, &sect; 1, Cl. 2 (emphases added).
Moreover, the Twelfth Amendment provides for the electors to vote for President
&quot;in their respective states&quot; and further provides that, if no
candidate receives a majority of votes of the presidential electors, the
House of Repre sentatives is to elect the President in a vote &quot;taken
by states, the representation from each state having one vote&quot; (emphases
added). These provisions make unam biguously clear that only the States
(and, derivatively, the citizens of States) may participate in presidential
elections.</P>

<P>The Twenty-third Amendment reinforces this under standing. That Amendment
permits the District of Co lumbia to appoint presidential electors, and
it specifies that the number of such electors shall be &quot;equal to the
whole number of Senators and Representatives in Con gress to which the District
would be entitled if it were a State, but in no event more than the least
populous State&quot; (emphasis added). The Amendment obviously presupposes
that, because the District of Columbia is not a State, it could not have
participated in the presi dential election absent a constitutional amendment.</P>

<P>The Constitution also expressly distinguishes be tween States and territories,
the latter of which are no where mentioned in the clauses addressing presidential
elections, but which are addressed in a separate clause providing that &quot;[t]he
Congress shall have Power to dis pose of and make all needful Rules and
Regulations re specting the Territory or other property belonging to the
United States.&quot; Art. IV, &sect; 3, Cl. 2. Moreover, when the Twelfth
Amendment was ratified in 1804, United States &quot;Territory&quot; (outside
of any State) included the Indiana Territory, the Mississippi Territory,
and the Louisiana Territory. Nonetheless, the Amendment con firmed that
only States would appoint presidential elec tors, after Congress specifically
rejected an alternative amendment that would have provided for the presiden
tial electors to be chosen by a nationwide popular vote. See McPherson v.
Blacker, 146 U.S. 1, 33-34 (1892).</P>

<P>The understanding that States, but not territories, would participate
in presidential elections has remained uniform throughout American history.
To pick but a few examples: the Indiana Territory and the Louisiana Ter
ritory did not participate in presidential elections either before or after
ratification of the Twelfth Amendment; Alaska and Hawaii did not participate
in presidential elections before achieving statehood in 1959; the District
of Columbia did not participate in presidential elections before ratification
of the Twenty-third Amendment in 1961; and territories within the meaning
of the Constitu tion, such as Puerto Rico (see Harris v. Rosario, 446 U.S.
651 (1980)), Guam, and the Virgin Islands, to this day do not participate
in presidential elections. This Court has held that &quot;'traditional ways
of conducting gov ernment * * * give meaning' to the Constitution,&quot;
Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 401 (1989) (ci tation omitted),
particularly where the practice at issue has spanned the entirety of American
history. See, e.g., Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U.S. 783, 792 (1983); United
States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., 299 U.S. 304, 328 (1936). That principle
clearly applies here, where no territory has ever participated in any of
the 54 presiden tial elections conducted over more than two centuries of
American history.1</P>

<P>b. Petitioner's fundamental premise-that the right to vote in presidential
elections accrues as a right of United States citizenship (Pet. 11)-is incorrect.
In fact, this Court has recognized that the right to appoint presi dential
electors is constitutionally vested in the States. See, e.g., Bush v. Gore,
531 U.S. 98, 104 (2000) (per curiam) (&quot;The individual citizen has no
federal constitu tional right to vote for electors for President of the
United States unless and until the state legislature chooses a statewide
election as the means to implement its power to appoint members of the electoral
college.&quot;); Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780, 794 n.18 (1983) (&quot;The
Constitution expressly delegates authority to the States to regulate the
selection of Presidential elec tors.&quot;); McPherson, 146 U.S. at 35 (&quot;the
appointment and mode of appointment of electors belong exclusively to the
States under the Constitution&quot;); In re Green, 134 U.S. 377, 379 (1890)
(referring to &quot;the vote of the State for President and Vice-President
of the nation&quot;); see also Romeu v. Cohen, 265 F.3d 118, 123 (2d Cir.
2001) (&quot;the Constitution does not directly confer on any citi zens
the right to vote in a presidential election.&quot;); In re Opinion of the
Justices, 107 A. 705, 706 (Me. 1919) (&quot;The language of section 1, subd.
2, is clear and unambiguous. It admits of no doubt as to where the constitutional
power of appointment is vested, namely, in the several states.&quot;).</P>

<P>Petitioners nevertheless contend (Pet. 10) that the specific constitutional
provisions governing presidential elections must be considered in conjunction
with other constitutional provisions governing voting rights, such as the
First, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments. But whatever the source and
scope of the right to vote in other contexts, there is simply no individual
constitu tional right to vote for President of the United States. For instance,
this Court made clear in Bush v. Gore that equal protection constraints
attach only after a &quot;state legislature vests the right to vote for
President in its people,&quot; and the Court stressed that &quot;[t]he State,
of course, after granting the franchise in the special con text of Article
II, can take back the power to appoint electors.&quot; 531 U.S. at 104.
In McPherson, the Court noted that &quot;[t]he constitution does not provide
that the appointment of electors shall be by popular vote&quot; (146 U.S.
at 27), and it specifically rejected a contention that a popular vote for
the President is required by the Four teenth and Fifteenth Amendments, including
the Equal Protection Clause (see id. at 38-40).</P>

<P>Nor do due process or equal protection principles, including the principle
of &quot;one person, one vote&quot; recog nized in Reynolds v. Sims, 377
U.S. 533 (1964), under mine the electoral college that provisions of the
Consti tution itself specifically mandate for presidential elec tions. In
Gray v. Sanders, 372 U.S. 368 (1963), for ex ample, the Court explained
that the electoral college, &quot;despite its inherent numerical inequality,&quot;
was &quot;vali dated&quot; by its specific inclusion in the Constitution.
Id. at 378; see id. at 380 (&quot;The only weighting of votes sanc tioned
by the Constitution concerns matters of represen tation, such as the allocation
of Senators irrespective of population and the use of the electoral college
in the choice of a President.&quot;). Similarly, in Reynolds, this Court
invalidated state apportionment plans inconsis tent with the &quot;one person,
one vote&quot; principle, but none theless stressed that the Senate apportionment
scheme (which, like the electoral college, does not follow the &quot;one
person, one vote&quot; principle) is &quot;one ingrained in our Constitution,
as part of the law of the land.&quot; 377 U.S. at 574.</P>

<P>c. The court of appeals decision is consistent with every court that
has addressed the issue of the right of constitutional territories (and
derivatively their citizens) to participate in presidential elections. In
Attorney General v. United States, 738 F.2d 1017, 1019 (1984), cert. denied,
469 U.S. 1209 (1985), the Ninth Circuit re jected a suit seeking presidential
voting rights brought on behalf of U.S. citizens residing in Guam. That
court explained that &quot;[t]he right to vote in presidential elec tions
under Article II inheres not in citizens but in states; citizens vote indirectly
for the President by vot ing for state electors.&quot; The court concluded:
&quot;Since Guam concededly is not a state, it can have no electors, and
plaintiffs cannot exercise individual votes in a presi dential election.
There is no constitutional violation.&quot;). Accord Sanchez v. United States,
376 F. Supp. 239, 242 (D.P.R. 1974) (&quot;until the Commonwealth [of Puerto
Rico] votes for Statehood, or until a constitutional amendment is approved
which extends the presidential and vice presidential vote to Puerto Rico,
there is no substantial constitutional question raised&quot;).</P>

<P>2. The court of appeals also correctly rejected peti tioners' contention
that various international instru ments support their request for judicial
intervention to permit citizens residing in Puerto Rico to participate in
presidential elections.</P>

<P>a. First, none of the international instruments in voked by the petitioners
creates legal rights or obliga tions enforceable through the courts. Two
of the in struments-the Universal Declaration and the Inter- American Democratic
Charter-are aspirational resolu tions that are not binding by their terms
and therefore cannot create legal rights or obligations.</P>

<P>With respect to the Universal Declaration, Eleanor Roosevelt, Chairman
of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights when the Declaration was
drafted, spoke for the United States and stated that the Declara tion &quot;was
not a treaty or international agreement and did not impose legal obligations;
it was rather a state ment of principles.&quot; See John P. Humphrey, The
UN Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, in The International
Protection of Human Rights 39, 50 (Evan Luard ed. 1967). Accordingly, the
Universal Declaration &quot;does not of its own force impose obligations
as a matter of international law.&quot; Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542 U.S.
692, 734 (2004); see also Flores v. Southern Peru Copper Corp., 414 F.3d
233, 261 n.38 (2d Cir. 2003) (Universal Declaration is &quot;merely a non-binding
resolution&quot;) (citation omitted).</P>

<P>The Inter-American Democratic Charter, adopted in 2001 by the General
Assembly of the Organization of American States (OAS), likewise is merely
a non-binding aspirational instrument. Immediately prior to the Char ter's
adoption, the U.S. Ambassador to the OAS made that point clear, stating
to the OAS that &quot;the United States understands that this Charter does
not establish any new rights or obligations under either domestic or international
law.&quot; Remarks of Ambassador Roger Noriega, OAS Permanent Council Meeting
(Sept. 6, 2001), excerpted in Representation: Inter-American Democratic
Charter, 2001 Digest chap. 6(I)(1), at 347. Moreover, the Charter speaks
in &quot;broad generalities&quot; and in that way confirms that its provisions
&quot;are decla rations of principles, not a code of legal rights.&quot;
Frolova v. Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, 761 F.2d 370, 374 (7th Cir.
1985). And the Charter itself gives no indica tion that it is to be enforced
by courts, but instead pro vides for an international diplomatic mechanism
to ad dress non-observance of its provisions. See Inter-Amer ican Democratic
Charter, arts. 17-22.</P>

<P>The ICCPR, while a binding international agree ment, is not self-executing
and, as the Executive stated when submitting it to the Senate for ratification,
its sub stantive provisions &quot;would not of themselves become effective
as domestic law.&quot; S. Exec. Docs. Nos. C, D, E, and F, 95th Cong., 2d
Sess., at vi (1978); see also Whit ney v. Robertson, 124 U.S. 190 (1888);
Buell v. Mitchell, 274 F.3d 337, 372 (6th Cir. 2001); Restatement (Third)
of the Foreign Relations Law of the United States &sect; 111 cmt. h (1987).
As &quot;a compact between independent na tions,&quot; the ICCPR &quot;depends
for the enforcement of its provisions on the interest and the honor of the
govern ments which are parties to it,&quot; and any infraction be comes
&quot;the subject of international negotiations and rec lamations.&quot;
Head Money Cases, 112 U.S. 580, 598 (1884). Thus, &quot;[i]t is obvious
that with all this the judi cial courts have nothing to do and can give
no redress.&quot; Ibid.</P>

<P>Moreover, the Senate expressly stated in its resolu tion of ratification
that &quot;the United States declares that the provisions of Articles 1
through 27 of the Covenant are not self-executing.&quot; 138 Cong. Rec.
8071 (1992). Thus, controlling authority from this Court, Sosa, 542 U.S.
at 734-735, establishes that the ICCPR is not self- executing and does not
create obligations enforceable in the courts. The Senate expressly conditioned
its ratifi cation of the ICCPR on the proviso that &quot;[n]othing in this
Covenant requires or authorizes legislation, or other action, by the United
States of America prohibited by the Constitution of the United States of
America as interpreted by the United States.&quot; 138 Cong. Rec. at 8071.
An interpretation of the ICCPR to require a change in the constitutional
framework for the selection of the President and Vice President would be
directly contrary to that understanding.</P>

<P>b. In any event, the international instruments relied on by petitioners
would provide no basis for relief in this case, because no international
instrument can alter the system set forth in the Constitution for selecting
the President and Vice President. This Court &quot;has regu larly and uniformly
recognized the supremacy of the Constitution over a treaty.&quot; Reid v.
Covert, 354 U.S. 1, 17 (1957) (plurality opinion); see In re Burt, 737 F.2d
1477, 1484 (7th Cir. 1984) (collecting cases). Indeed, it is &quot;obvious&quot;
that &quot;no agreement with a foreign nation can confer power on the Congress,
or on any other branch of Government, which is free from the restraints
of the Constitution.&quot; Reid, 354 U.S. at 16.</P>

<P>This principle applies even though the Supremacy Clause provides that
treaties shall be the &quot;Law of the Land.&quot; As the Reid Court held,
there is &quot;nothing in this language which intimates that treaties and
laws enacted pursuant to them do not have to comply with the provi sions
of the Constitution.&quot; 354 U.S. at 16. Statutes also are the &quot;Law
of the Land,&quot; but like treaties, must yield to the Constitution. And
because a statute can override or abrogate a treaty, &quot;[i]t would be
completely anoma lous to say that a treaty need not comply with the Con
stitution when such an agreement can be overridden by a statute that must
conform to that instrument.&quot; Id. at 18.2</P>

<P>c. Finally, even apart from questions of constitu tional supremacy and
judicial enforceability, adherence to the electoral college system is not
inconsistent with any of the three international instruments at issue. Each
of those instruments speaks generally concerning the right to vote in periodic
elections and to take part in the governance of one's country. Those rights
are exer cised by the citizens of Puerto Rico within the context of a vibrant
democratic political system. Federal law es tablishes Puerto Rico as a Commonwealth
with rights of self-government and guarantees its citizens numerous statutory
and constitutional rights. See, e.g., 48 U.S.C. 731d, 734, 737; 8 U.S.C.
1402; Rodriguez v. Popular Democratic Party, 457 U.S. 1, 7-8 (1982); Trailer
Ma rine Transport Corp. v. Rivera Vazquez, 977 F.2d 1 (1st Cir. 1992); Lopez
v. Aran, 844 F.2d 898, 902 (1st Cir. 1988).3</P>

<P>On the important question of Puerto Rico's status in relation to the
United States, the citizens of Puerto Rico have not been denied their right
to participate. Com monwealth status, as opposed to statehood, has advan
tages as well as disadvantages. See, e.g., 26 U.S.C. 933 (income of Puerto
Rico residents is not subject to fed eral income tax). With full knowledge
of both the bene fits and drawbacks of statehood, including the implica
tions of that status on participation in presidential elec tions, the citizens
of Puerto Rico have voted repeat edly-in 1967, 1993, and 1998-against statehood.
See Jos&eacute; Tr&iacute;as Monge, Plenary Power and the Principle of Liberty:
An Alternative View of the Political Condition of Puerto Rico, 68 Rev. Jur.
U.P.R. 1, 12-13, 17, 19 (1999).</P>

<P>3. The court of appeals also correctly held that the Declaratory Judgment
Act does not provide relief here. Because the international instruments
at issue provide no individual legal rights, a court cannot enter a declara
tory judgment on the question whether United States action is inconsistent
with those instruments. Entering such a judgment would be an unwarranted
intrusion by the courts into matters of domestic constitutional struc ture
and delicate areas of foreign relations in which they are ill-equipped to
operate, and would reflect an incor rect use of the Declaratory Judgment
Act to circumvent the lack of both private rights and judicial enforce ability.</P>

<P>The Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. 2201, pro vides that &quot;[i]n
a case of actual controversy within its jurisdiction * * * any court of
the United States, upon the filing of an appropriate pleading, may declare
the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such
declaration, whether or not further relief is or could be sought.&quot;
Despite this seemingly broad language, the reach of the Act is limited and
was not designed to circumvent a lack of jurisdiction, rights, or a substantive
right of action. See Green v. Mansour, 474 U.S. 64, 73 (1985) (holding that
&quot;a declaratory judgment is not available when the result would be a
partial 'end run' around&quot; Eleventh Amendment immunity); Marshall v.
Crotty, 185 F.2d 622, 628 (1st Cir. 1950) (holding that, where a former
government employee did not have a right to reinstatement by way of mandamus,
the court &quot;is likewise without jurisdiction to give a declaratory judgment
determining the reinstatement rights&quot;). Where a party seeking declaratory
relief has no under lying substantive right of action, a declaratory judgment
not only serves as an inappropriate &quot;end run,&quot; but also results
in a judgment that is &quot;futile and ineffective.&quot; Id. at 627. As
a judgment that under no circumstances could be backed by a coercive order,
it &quot;would serve no purpose whatever in resolving the remaining dispute
between the parties, and is unavailable for that reason&quot; as well. Green,
474 U.S. at 73 n.2; see Riva v. Massa chusetts, 61 F.3d 1003, 1010 (1st
Cir. 1995).</P>

<P>Indeed, a naked declaration concerning the United States' observance
of otherwise judicially unenforceable international instruments would not
&quot;clarify[] and set tle[] the legal relations in issue,&quot; nor would
it &quot;terminate and afford relief from the uncertainty, insecurity, and
controversy giving rise to the proceeding.&quot; Edwin Borchard, Declaratory
Judgments 299 (2d ed. 1941). Such a declaration would serve only to embroil
the Court in an ongoing political debate by offering the panel's opinion
in areas of constitutional structure that are committed to the statehood
or amendment process and matters of foreign policy within the responsibility
of the political Branches. The court of appeals therefore correctly held
that declaratory relief is inappropriate.</P>

<P>1 Petitioner argues (Pet. 10) that Ohio has participated in pre sidential
elections since 1803 even though it was &quot;not formally admitted as a
state until 1953&quot; due to a technical error. However, the courts have
uniformly rejected the contention that Ohio was not properly admitted as
a State in 1803. See, e.g., Knoblauch v. Commissioner, 749 F.2d 200, 201-202
(5th Cir. 1984) (collecting cases), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 830 (1985); State
v. Bob Manashian Painting, 782 N.E.2d 701, 704 (Ohio Mun. Ct. 2002) (&quot;Litigants
in other courts have argued that Ohio is not a state, or that it was never
properly admitted to the Union. These assertions are entirely groundless.&quot;)
(collecting cases); see also Bowman v. Government of the U.S., 920 F. Supp.
623, 625 n.4 (E.D. Pa. 1995) (concluding that the 1953 presidential declaration
of Ohio's statehood was &quot;purely ceremonial&quot;). This Court reocgnized
long ago that Ohio was &quot;admitted to the Union in 1802, under an act
of Congress.&quot; Van Brocklin v. Tennessee, 117 U.S. 151, 160 (1886);
see also Piqua Branch of the State Bank v. Knoop, 57 U.S. (16 How.) 369,
384 (1854) (discussing Ohio Enabling Act).</P>

<P>2 This Court's decision in Roper v. Simmons, 125 S. Ct. 1183 (2005),
does nothing to undermine this longstanding principle. In that case, the
Court looked to international understanding to confirm its holding that
imposition of the death penalty for offenders under the age of 18 at the
time of the offense is inconsistent with evolving standards of decency and
therefore violates the Eighth Amendment. See id. at 1198-99; see also id.
at 1200 (acknowledging that the opinion of the world community is &quot;not
controlling our outcome&quot;). Unlike questions of cruel and unusual punishment
under the Eighth Amendment, the validity of the consti tutional framework
establishing the electoral college is not subject to a standard that focuses
on &quot;evolving standards of decency.&quot; Thus, nothing in Roper permits
resort to international instruments to over ride the clear commands of Article
II.</P>

<P>3 The United Nations has recognized that &quot;the people of the Com
monwealth of Puerto Rico have effectively exercised their right to self-
determination,&quot; and &quot;the people of the Commonwealth of Puerto
Rico have been invested with attributes of political sovereignty which clearly
identify the status of self-government attained by the Puerto Rican people
as that of an autonomous political entity.&quot; G.A. Res. 748, U.N. GAOR,
8th Sess., Supp. No. 17, at 26, U.N. Doc. A/2630 (1953).
