<h2 class="speechdate">Alexandria, Virginia<br />February 13, 2007</h2>
<p>	Thank you, Ernie, and hello, everyone.</p>
<p>	It always feels good to be here in the company of the dedicated people who work
at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and I appreciate the
time that many of you are taking, away from your families, to participate in
this program.</p>
<p>	NCMEC is hosting the first in a series of training programs that we’ll be
having all over the country. I believe it will prove critical in making this
year, the second year of Project Safe Childhood, a very successful one, indeed.</p>
<p>	This training is important. And I want to be very clear as to why.</p>
<p>	To a pedophile or a sexual predator, our children are prey. The pedophile hunts
our children.</p>
<p>	It is our responsibility, in law enforcement and as adults, to find the
predators first. To bring them to justice before they catch their prey: our
kids.
 
	Pedophiles watch our children from the shadows. They lie in wait, studying,
planning to ensnare and violate the innocent.</p>
<p>	So we must watch them from our vantage point. We must study the predator, and
carefully plan our course of action for their capture and prosecution.</p>
<p>	At this training program, you will learn how to best pursue them, to interrupt
their sadistic hunt. Together, we can make these hunters feel like they are the
hunted. 
 
	Because we all pray for, and work for, a day when children in this country are
safe from the leering eyes, the insidious stalking, and the unthinkable cruelty
that pedophiles inflict upon them.</p>
<p>	Anyone who has worked on a crimes-against-children case knows that pedophiles
aren’t your average criminal.</p>
<p>	Investigators are often aided by the foolishness of thieves, for example.
Rarely so with the pedophile. He is often very smart. He studies his victims.
He looks for places where children gather and times where they are vulnerable
to attack or enticement. He learns their habits and weaknesses and plans
accordingly. Or, if the target is within the predator's own home, as is often
and sadly the case, he knows how to conceal the sexual abuse from his
neighbors.</p>
<p>	As part of your training, you will study the pedophile – his methods, his
online tactics – and the tools we have to catch him. You’ll learn more about
how to look for his hiding places on the internet. More about how to
investigate a Cybertipline Lead. New ways to work with digital evidence. And
how to use the federal system as another weapon in your arsenal – whether it
provides you with a stronger sentence or helps extract a plea.</p>
<p>	Sexual predators have also developed a network – they encourage and help each
other in their twisted goals. This week, we’ll work on our network.</p>
<p>	Predators have found camaraderie online. In their quest to exploit children,
they seek advice from their peers in chat rooms. Tips are shared on how to
become a foster parent or where to become a camp counselor. This network
enhances their terrifying abilities as individual hunters of children.</p>
<p>	As part of your training here, we will work on our camaraderie, our network.
You will learn from your peers, and they from you. In fact, our ability to work
seamlessly together at the state, local, and federal levels, is the most
important part of the arsenal we are building against those who seek to hurt
our kids. It’s what Project Safe Childhood is all about.</p>
<p>	And it’s what makes this training program so important and unique.  You are
here with law-enforcement colleagues from all of those levels.  We don’t want
you to leave without getting to know them and being absolutely convinced that
they are part of your team and you a part of theirs.</p>
<p>	Through this program, we will increase our traction against the pedophiles by
strengthening the family of law enforcement. Think of it this way: we must
function like a family to protect American families.</p>
<p>	When state and local law enforcement can work as easily and naturally with
federal prosecutors as you already do with your district attorneys, Project
Safe Childhood will be living up to its goals.</p>
<p>	We witnessed a good example of this very recently, at the end of January, when
cooperative work by the FBI, the Sioux Falls, South Dakota Police Department,
the Bismarck, North Dakota Police Department and the North Dakota Bureau of
Criminal Investigation led to a man being charged with traveling across state
lines with intent to have illicit sexual conduct with a minor.</p>
<p>	In that case, investigators and prosecutors are working seamlessly together to
try the case in the appropriate jurisdiction and seeking maximum penalties.</p>
<p>	Also in January, in a case where city, county, and federal investigators worked
together to build the case, a former nurse pleaded guilty to using a minor in
his custody to produce child pornography. While working at the Missouri State
Veterans Home, William Price repeatedly drugged a minor victim, and, while she
was unconscious, videotaped himself molesting and raping her. The U.S. Attorney
said that never before had he encountered anything so “revoltingly sadistic and
morally repugnant.”</p>
<p>	Those cases are strong examples of the immeasurable good that can come from
cooperation. We cannot measure how many children have been spared by the
incarceration of just those two men.</p>
<p>	Constantly expanding our ability to work that way – together, quickly, and
effectively – is our tactical goal.</p>
<p>	We’re doing it because it’s the right thing to do. Because it works. And
because when I reassure American parents that we are doing everything possible
to protect their children, I don’t want just a few great examples of
cooperation. I want it to be the standard operating procedure for everyone
involved in PSC, nationally.</p>
<p>	For PSC partners, I want the titles of “state,” “federal,” and “local” to be
just that, mere titles.</p>
<p>	I have instructed U.S. Attorneys to put out the welcome mat to all law
enforcement. Because to make this initiative work, everyone needs to sit down
together and decide which jurisdiction works best for each case.</p>
<p>	This conference will prepare you to work most effectively and efficiently with
federal prosecutors once you’ve passed that welcome mat and are sitting at the
table, together.</p>
<p>	I am deeply grateful for the work you are already doing on Project Safe
Childhood, and for the work you will do in the months and years ahead. You are
the cavalry of what the President has called the “armies of compassion” –
rising up to battle the evils of our society.</p>
<p>	Here, today, you will prepare your mounts and load your packs. You will ready
yourselves for the righteous pursuit of the criminals who treat children as
prey.</p>
<p>	I think the President put it very well when he signed the Adam Walsh Act. He
said: “Protecting our children is our solemn responsibility. It's what we must
do. When a child's life or innocence is taken it is a terrible loss -- it's an
act of unforgivable cruelty. Our society has a duty to protect our children
from exploitation and danger.”</p>
<p>	My friends, we have the power to change the battlefield, and specifically, as I
said before, turn the tables on the hunters.
 
	The victory of safe childhoods will be our legacy.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>	People often ask me what keeps me up at night. Obviously the threat of a
terrorist attack never leaves my mind, and it is the top priority of our
government to keep that from happening.</p>
<p>	But it is the faces of child victims that haunt my dreams. I can see their
eyes, that awful emptiness, as if their young souls are trying to detach
themselves from their desecrated bodies.</p>
<p>	Like you, I see the victims’ images as part of my work. But now they are part
of my heart, and I am not going to tire in this fight to protect them.</p>
<p>	We must bring pedophiles and predators to justice before they touch one more
child.</p>
<p>	With the tools of this training in hand, you will be even better prepared than
you already are to go out, track these criminals down, and take them off of our
streets.</p>
<p>	I look forward to the victories ahead. The day when we catch and prosecute the
criminal who is buying child pornography and has signed up to be a summer camp
counselor… but hasn’t yet touched a child.</p>
<p>	A day when justice is served before an already-abusive parent invites his
daughter’s friends over for a slumber party.</p>
<p>	A day when we never hear from the people who brag on the Internet about being
revolutionaries, fighting for the so-called “sexual rights of children” – as
though they are doing kids a favor by sexually molesting and exploiting them.</p>
<p>	I want these pedophiles off the streets.</p>
<p>	I want them put away for as long as the law will allow.</p>
<p>	And I want law enforcement to act as a united front against this threat.</p>
<p>	You and I won’t tolerate the continued victimization, exploitation and
desecration of our children.</p>
<p>	I look forward to the day when no one else in this nation will, either.</p>
<p>	I want to close with the story of recent PSC case in Oklahoma City, where a man
was sentenced to 18 years in federal prison for enticing a 10-year-old girl to
engage in sexually explicit conduct and then videotaping the assault.</p>
<p>	In an incredible twist of fate, the man’s crime was discovered by three
teenagers who were committing their own crime – stealing the predator’s video
camera. After watching the tape in the stolen camera, the three teenagers told
their parents what a terrible thing they’d seen. The parents then told local
police, and a joint investigation by local, state, and federal investigators
was initiated. The rest, as they say, is history. And today, the children of
Oklahoma City are safe from a dangerous predator.</p>
<p>	I find hope in the unexpected. When even juvenile delinquents are helping to
catch pedophiles and predators, we can’t help but be inspired to press on in
this battle that can be very difficult … but that I believe defines justice.</p>
<p>	Thank you again for coming to this program. May God bless and guide your
important work, may He protect our children and may He continue to bless this
great nation.  Thank you.</p>
