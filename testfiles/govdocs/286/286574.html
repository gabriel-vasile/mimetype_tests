	<P>To the PUBLIC.</P>
	
	
	<P>IT does no honor to this city that a paper should be carried through its streets, to
	
    justify the granting money to the troops, which has so direct a tendency to counter-act
	
    all that the colonies have been contending for; without an answer to its fallacious and
	
    pernicious contents. I expected the Son of Liberty would have exposed the
	
    misrepresentations contained in it, but as he has not made his appearance, I conclude he
	
    does not think it worth a serious refutation. If there were not many falshoods in the
	
    address, that tend to impose on the ignorant; I should not be at any trouble to answer so
	
    scurrilous and flimsy an author, as the Citizen must appear to be to any man of sense. He
	
    has however verified what the Son of Liberty asserted in the exordium of his first paper,
	
    to wit, &quot;That the minions of tyranny are indefatigible in their endeavours to enslave
	
    this country.&quot; This is a truth that glares with irresistable evidence. The Citizen
	
    felt the force of the arguments advanced by the Son of Liberty, and therefore knew that an
	
    attempt to refute them, would only contrast them with falshoods; which would serve to show
	
    truth in a stronger point of light. To prevent which he puts together a number of
	
    falshoods, affirmations, and questions to confuse the minds of the unintelligent; in order
	
    to draw their attention from their danger. But he is greatly mistaken; notwithstanding all
	
    his pretentions to patriotism, the Sons of Liberty see the cloven foot of despotism in his
	
    fallacious paper. The foundation upon which this very illogical gentleman proceeds to
	
    ensnare us, is, that our assembly's granting money to the troops, is to procure us a paper
	
    currency, a repeal of the revenue acts, in short it is to be the primum mobile or
	
    efficient cause that is to set us free, and make us a rich and happy people. Strange that
	
    all the money that we have hitherto given for this purpose, should not have had that, but
	
    a contrary effect. And now our giving it is to produce wonders. Let us examine what ground
	
    there is for all the mighty and important effects, that are to flow from this grant to the
	
    troops.</P> 
	
	 
	
    <P>First, With respect to its obtaining a paper currency. If the Lieutenant Governor has
	
    instructions from the King his master, to give his consent to a bill to emit a paper
	
    currency, it must be attributed to the government's seeing it of utility to the province.
	
    If so, Why is the giving the money to the troops a condition, without which he will not
	
    give his consent to such a bill? No reason can be assigned for making such a condition to
	
    induce him to obey his master's orders. If on the contrary he has no such instructions,
	
    (as I am well inform'd he hath not) what security can we have; that although the
	
    Lieutenant Governor should give his consent to the bill, his Majesty would confirm it?
	
    None at all. What advantage then will his consent be to us? Of none but to deceive us.
	
    Even although the bills were now emitted and in circulation; if the King puts a negative
	
    on the bill, the loan-offices that gave out the money would be annihilated; the people
	
    would pay off some of their debts with the bills; and the last possessor would lose his
	
    money, or be put to the expence of a law suit: and thus instead of relief to the colony,
	
    confusion and distraction would ensue.</P>
	
	
	<P>Secondly, As to our giving the money to the troops, having the least tendency to repeal
	
    the revenue acts it's the most unlikely and preposterous reason that can be offered. Was
	
    it by our passivity that the stamp act was repealed? No, but by our declaring our
	
    abhorrence of it, in every way that could be devised; except treason and rebellion; from
	
    both which I hope America will ever be preserved. Remember what your great patron Mr. Pitt
	
    said in the house of commons. &quot;I rejoice that America has resisted.&quot; It is well
	
    known that the present ministry have saddled us with taxes and impositions as grievous and
	
    as incompatible with our freedom, as the stamp act was. Did our silence and inactivity
	
    with respect to the revenue acts, bring the ministry at home or their tools abroad; to a
	
    disposition to repeal them? No, the contrary is too well known. Is it not the united voice
	
    of America and of our friends in England, that the non-importation agreement of our
	
    merchants, and the clamours of the people in England against their tyrannical
	
    administration; that have brought them to consider the repeal of those acts necessary?
	
    Doubtless it is. And although they are pressed with these difficulties at home and abroad,
	
    and ministerial assurances have been given that those acts will be repealed, the next
	
    session of parliament, (in order to lull America asleep, that they might the better crush
	
    the friends of liberty at home,) yet we have advice by every vessel from England, doubting
	
    the certainty of their repeal. If then there is a doubt, that the united voice and
	
    opposition of a people, will not be effectual to get a repeal of the revenue acts,
	
    certainly an inconsistency of conduct will make it more doubtful. For the nature of the
	
    non-importation agreement is <EM>opposition</EM> to the conduct of the ministry. . . .</P>
	
	
	<P>And now Sons of Liberty, be not discouraged at the fallacious squibs of the minions of
	
    power, there shall not be wanting persons of your own class, that will expose the cloven
	
    foot whenever it appears with a design to enslave you. Be firm therefore, although it
	
    should be said there are not any of the first people among you, you have more to fear if
	
    this country is enslaved than they have, their riches will screen them from many hardships
	
    that you will be exposed to, on such a dreadful event, and while you are free make a noble
	
    struggle to preserve your liberties, and there is no doubt but you will succeed.</P>
	
	
	<P>New-York, December 23, 1769...........A PLEBEIAN.
