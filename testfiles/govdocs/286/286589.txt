AND   REPUBLIC   OF   HAYTI.                 [171
have flown to the aid, and into the arms, of their breth-
ren and countrymen of the South-west. And could
Pétion and a few vile satellites, partisans of the French,
ranged under the white flag, fighting for slavery and
the subjection of their country, could they have resisted
a whole people ?—an hundred thousand warriors, rallied
beneath their national colours, fighting in defence of
their rights, their lives, and their property, for the

the yoke of slavery and of France. It is a thing morally
and physically impossible. Equally hopeless will be
every attempt that the Ex-colonists may suggest to the
French government to divide, to deceive, to mislead, or
to ensnare us. It is impossible that any such insidious
expedients should succeed, for their object is, in its
nature, impracticable; and, if the French government
persists in following the counsels and the plans of the
Ex-co'.onists, disappointment and disgrace will ever be,
as they have hitherto always been, the results; and all
