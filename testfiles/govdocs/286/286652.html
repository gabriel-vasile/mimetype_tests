Each bag contained approximately 32 meters of hollow plastic tubing, all wrapped in colored synthetic raffia string (several different colors); in each case, approximately 21.5 meters of the tubing contained powders (see Photo 2, next page). Analysis of the removed powders (total net mass 909.3 grams) by color testing (Scotts - positive), GC/FID, GC/MS, and FTIR/ATR confirmed 65, 49, 42, and 47 percent cocaine hydrochloride in the four handbags, respectively, all adulterated with caffeine and lactose (not quantitated).

The exhibits were seized at a residence in Sacramento by California Department of Justice Bureau of Firearms personnel, pursuant to a warrant search on firearms charges. During entry, the officers witnessed an individual transferring the contents from one of the sachets into a glass vial by use of a syringe. The individual admitted that the oils in the sachets were steroids that he had purchased over the Internet. Embossed on the edge of each sachet was the code 24100704; investigation indicated that this product is advertised as a &ldquo;Stealth Injectable,&rdquo; and that the packaging date and contents are embossed in a code on the side of the sachet (in this case, the code corresponded to October 24, 2007, and the last two digits &ldquo;04&rdquo; indicated testosterone cypionate). Analysis of a methanolic extract of the oil by GC/MS confirmed testosterone cypionate (not quantitated). This is the first such submission to the laboratory.</font></p>

The first exhibit consisted of one-quarter inch square of blotter paper, orange on one side and blank on the other; analysis by Erlichs (negative), GC, and GC/MS indicated not LSD but rather 4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxyamphetamine (DOI). The second exhibit consisted of a rectangular piece of blotter paper, blank on both sides and perforated into three quarter-inch squares; analysis (same techniques) indicated not LSD but rather 4-chloro-2,5-dimethoxyamphetamine (DOC). The exhibits were not formally quantitated, but both had a high loading based on their GC chromatograms.

In the preliminary stages of this project, the participating laboratories analyzed the physical characteristics, the chemical composition, and the organic impurities of MDMA tablets, using previously harmonised methods. The aim of this work was to apply statistical treatments to the recorded data in order to evaluate their potential. The first part of this article deals with organic impurities data, while the second part focuses on the potential of the physical characteristics. The statistical methods allowed differentiation of samples from different batches, and determination of links between samples.
