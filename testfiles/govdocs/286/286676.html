          <h3 class="tier5">Chapter III: Delivery of Services </h3>
          <p>The plans that Head Start grantees developed for the Oral Health 
            Initiative (OHI) focused largely on oral health education; preventive 
            services; and capacity building with community, county, and state 
            dental professionals and professional organizations.&nbsp; While grantees 
            already had systems in place for providing dental exams and treatment 
            as required by Head Start Program Performance Standards, OHI services 
            were intended to supplement existing services, reduce the need for 
            treatment through prevention, and increase the percentage of children 
            and pregnant women receiving needed care.&nbsp; This chapter further 
            explores the types of oral health services and activities Head Start 
            grantees carried out in the first year of implementation.&nbsp; It 
            focuses on the five main categories of activities and services grantees 
            provided to children and families through the OHI: (1) education for 
            parents, pregnant women, and children; (2) establishment of dental 
            homes for children and pregnant women; (3) preventive and treatment 
            dental care services; (4) support services; and (5) distribution of 
            supplies.&nbsp; Information for this chapter comes from two main sources: 
            (1) record-keeping system data and (2) telephone interviews conducted 
            with grantee staff.&nbsp; </p>
          <h4>Oral Health Education </h4>
          <p>Grantees reported that a common barrier to dental care was the lack 
            of education among families about the importance of oral health care 
            for young children.&nbsp; According to grantee staff, many parents 
            believed that primary teeth were unimportant because children eventually 
            lose these teeth.&nbsp; In addition, many parents feared taking their 
            children to a dentist based on their own negative or painful experiences.&nbsp; 
            To overcome these barriers and promote oral health care for children, 
            parents of children at high risk for caries should receive education 
            that motivates them to take an active role in their children&rsquo;s 
            oral health and information that reinforces proper oral hygiene and 
            dietary habits at home (Brown et al. 2005a; Brown et al. 2005b). </p>
          <p>To promote attitudes and beliefs conducive to supporting healthy 
            teeth and gums, the OHI grantees reported providing education to three 
            key groups: (1) parents and primary caregivers, (2) pregnant women, 
            and (3) preschool children.&nbsp; In addition to educational opportunities 
            for families and children, grantees also discussed the benefits of 
            training for staff.&nbsp; As described in Chapter II, grantees provided 
            training on oral health curricula and prevention strategies to improve 
            staff&rsquo;s understanding of oral health care.&nbsp; This increased 
            understanding was intended to benefit the families staff members serve, 
            as well as improve their own oral health status.</p>
          <h4>Education for Parents</h4>
          <p> Nearly all grantees (94 percent) described parent education as a 
            main goal or key component.&nbsp; In response to this goal, all grantees 
            reported providing some type of oral health education for parents.&nbsp; 
            According to the record-keeping system data, 82 percent of grantees 
            provided some form of oral health education for parents between February 
            and May 2007 (Table III.1).&nbsp; More than half of the grantees reported 
            providing parent education through workshops (at parent meetings or 
            special events) or home visits once a month.&nbsp; Through workshops 
            and home visits together, grantees provided education to nearly 2,000 
            parents a month on average.&nbsp; </p>

          </table>
          <p> Education for parents followed 
            two main formats: (1) integration into already existing formats and 
            (2) newly created events and workshops.&nbsp; Grantees that integrated 
            educational messages about oral health into already existing formats 
            provided education during parent meetings, home visits, and parent 
            conferences and through materials distributed to parents, such as 
            monthly newsletters and take-home activities from classroom curricula 
            (see box).&nbsp; New formats included specially planned workshops, 
            additional home visits from oral health professionals, educational 
            opportunities that took place during dental appointments, and special 
            events.&nbsp; For example, grantees planned events that brought together 
            families and dental professionals, as well as trainings for parents 
            conducted by grantee staff or a combination of grantee and community 
            partner staff.&nbsp; </p>
          <p>Educational opportunities integrated 
            into existing avenues of contact with parents were most commonly the 
            responsibility of home visitors and family service workers.&nbsp; 
            These staff frequently received training and resources, such as curricula 
            materials, Internet resources, and theme bags or kits containing materials 
            and supplies.&nbsp; They, in turn, used the training and resources 
            to educate parents.&nbsp; Grantees that offered education at special 
            events and workshops more commonly relied on oral health specialists, 
            health specialists, or other dental professionals to deliver messages.&nbsp; 
            These staff members conducted training at specially planned events 
            and workshops or during annual parent meetings focused on oral health.&nbsp; 
            In some cases, specialized staff and professionals also conducted 
            home visits with parents to assess oral health needs and provide individualized 
            education.&nbsp; Grantees that used OHI funds to create new staff 
            positions were more likely than grantees that used existing staff 
            to report specialized home visits and training workshops.&nbsp; All 
            grantees relied on classroom teachers, home visitors, and family service 
            workers to reinforce oral health education with families.</p>

          <p>The most common educational messages delivered during trainings were 
            on preventive care and the importance of oral health care for young 
            children.&nbsp; Programs provided parents with information on prevention 
            and early detection of dental caries, how oral health development 
            relates to overall physical development, when and how parents should 
            care for their children&rsquo;s teeth and gums, and the importance 
            of preventive care for all family members.&nbsp; Half of the grantees 
            cited skills training on dental hygiene as a key educational message 
            for parents.&nbsp; Grantees reported showing parents how to brush 
            their children&rsquo;s teeth, wipe infants&rsquo; gums, and encourage 
            proper tooth brushing techniques with children.&nbsp; Information 
            on healthy nutrition and the role of nutrition in promoting healthy 
            teeth was included in education delivered to parents by 36 percent 
            of grantees.&nbsp; Other commonly cited educational topics included 
            the developmental milestones in oral health development; dentist visit 
            procedures or information about what to expect at the dentist&rsquo;s 
            office; how to conduct visual inspections of children&rsquo;s teeth 
            using methods such as &ldquo;Lift the Lip&rdquo; (Lee et al. 1993);<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"class="superscript" id="_ftnref1">1</a> 
            and behaviors that threaten oral health, such as the use of bottles 
            and &ldquo;sippy cups&rdquo; beyond recommended ages (see box). </p>
          <h4>Education for Pregnant Women</h4>
          <p> Almost half of grantees (46 percent) provided oral health education 
            specifically tailored to pregnant women. Information about oral health 
            was most often delivered to pregnant women during home visits (63 
            percent of the grantees that offered education to pregnant women).&nbsp; 
            Another third of these grantees (32 percent) conducted workshops or 
            training classes on oral health, and about half of these were delivered 
            in combination with education during home visits.&nbsp; These events 
            were sometimes one-time trainings, while other grantees delivered 
            a series of classes.&nbsp; One grantee reported conducting a training 
            at the start of the Early Head Start program year and then a follow-up 
            training about five months later, which is typically after women have 
            had their babies.&nbsp; This format allowed the oral health coordinator 
            to focus the first training on the importance of practicing preventive 
            care, including dental visits, during pregnancy and the follow-up 
            training on caring for infants&rsquo; oral health.&nbsp; </p>
          <p>While the main educational messages delivered to pregnant women mirrored 
            those delivered to Head Start parents, additional topics specific 
            to pregnancy were also addressed.&nbsp; These topics included how 
            to care for teeth during pregnancy, key milestones for care during 
            pregnancy, prevention of the transmission of dental caries, and the 
            use of xylitol products.&nbsp; In addition, contact with pregnant 
            women also focused on encouraging dental visits and working with women 
            to find access to dental providers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
          <p>Grantee staff, including home visitors and oral health coordinators, 
            typically provided education to pregnant women.&nbsp; Grantees also 
            partnered with dental hygienists, nursing students, and Women, Infants 
            and Children (WIC) staff to deliver oral health education.</p>
          <h4>Education for Children </h4>
          <p>According to record-keeping system data, more than 80 percent of 
            the OHI grantees provided oral health education to children at least 
            monthly from February through May 2007 (Table III.1).&nbsp; To encourage 
            healthy dental hygiene habits among Head Start children, grantees 
            reported educating children on how to care for their teeth, specifically 
            proper tooth brushing techniques.&nbsp; Education also focused on 
            healthy eating and nutrition and what to expect during dental appointments 
            (see box).&nbsp; Education for children most commonly occurred in 
            the classroom or during home visits (75 percent of grantees).&nbsp; 
            However, staff used other opportunities to teach children about the 
            importance of oral health, such as at dental appointments and special 
            events.&nbsp; For example, some grantees held events for Dental Health 
            Month and provided oral health education at community celebrations 
            and health fairs.&nbsp; </p>

          </table>
          <p>Grantees used various materials to support lessons about oral health.&nbsp; 
            Lessons frequently included reading a storybook about caring for teeth 
            or visiting the dentist.&nbsp; Storybooks were often included in curricula 
            materials or purchased to support oral health lessons.&nbsp; Grantees 
            also had puppets available in classrooms and during home visits.&nbsp; 
            Staff used puppets with oversized teeth and toothbrushes to demonstrate 
            tooth brushing techniques and had puppets of dentists available for 
            children to play with and familiarize themselves with dental professionals&rsquo; 
            white coats and tools.&nbsp; Other grantees used models of teeth to 
            demonstrate proper dental hygiene.&nbsp; Dramatic play centers helped 
            familiarize children with the tools dentists and dental hygienists 
            use, such as mirrors and flashlights.&nbsp; These materials were included 
            in dramatic play centers with other props, such as white coats, to 
            allow children to become comfortable with the objects they could expect 
            to see at the dentist&rsquo;s office.&nbsp; One grantee even reported 
            housing a dental chair in classrooms for children to sit in prior 
            to a visit from a dentist.&nbsp; </p>
          <p>In nearly three-fourths (73 percent) of grantees, teachers and home 
            visitors carried out oral health education activities with children 
            by integrating oral health lessons into the daily, weekly, or monthly 
            lesson plans.&nbsp; Eleven percent of grantees required teachers to 
            provide oral health lessons either weekly or monthly, and some were 
            required to document oral health objectives in lesson plans.&nbsp; 
            In addition to education provided by teachers and home visitors, grantee 
            staff, mainly oral health specialists and dental hygienists, provided 
            education to children.&nbsp; Often these staff members would visit 
            classrooms or accompany home visitors a couple times a year to teach 
            children about oral health. These visits frequently occurred in conjunction 
            with dental services.&nbsp; For example, hygienists reported visiting 
            classrooms a week or a few days before they were scheduled to conduct 
            screenings and fluoride varnishes.&nbsp; These visits had three main 
            objectives: (1) introduce the hygienists to the children, (2) present 
            a lesson on oral health, and (3) demonstrate the service they would 
            be providing to reduce children&rsquo;s fears.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
          <h4> Curricula Used for Oral Health Education</h4>
          <p> To support oral health education, 67 percent of grantees reported 
            using one or more oral health curricula.&nbsp; Rather than relying 
            solely on one curriculum, most grantees reported using selected components 
            of one curriculum in combination with other curricula or resources.&nbsp; 
            Grantees explained that the combination of various curricula allowed 
            them to better tailor their oral health education to the needs of 
            families.&nbsp; For example, drawing on multiple resources enabled 
            grantees to target messages to families that speak multiple home languages, 
            parents with low literacy levels, and families served through multiple 
            program options (for example, home visits and classroom presentations).&nbsp; 
            Moreover, staff drew from multiple curricula to target educational 
            messages to parents, preschool children, and pregnant women. <br />

          <p>Grantees reported using widely available curricula as well as 
                locally or regionally designed curricula, such as those developed 
                by state departments of health, local universities, and regional 
                initiatives (see box).&nbsp; The most commonly cited curriculum 
                used by grantees was &ldquo;Bright Futures, Bright Smiles: An 
                Oral Health and Early Literacy Program for Head Start and Early 
                Childhood Programs&rdquo; developed by Colgate (Colgate Bright 
                Futures, Bright Smiles 2003).&nbsp; Colgate&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bright 
                Futures, Bright Smiles&rdquo; contains resources for promoting 
                early literacy while helping children ages 3 to 8 establish and 
                maintain positive oral health behaviors.&nbsp; Available materials 
                include a teacher&rsquo;s manual and classroom posters, as well 
                as storybooks for children and parent booklets.&nbsp; The materials 
                are available in both English and Spanish.&nbsp; Materials are 
                available at low cost, and many materials are available free of 
                charge online.&nbsp; Other commonly used curricula included &ldquo;Cavity 
                Free Kids&rdquo; (Huntley, B., and J. Hagen 2004a; Huntley, B., 
                and J. Hagen 2004b), &ldquo;Open Wide&rdquo; (Holt, K., and R. 
                Barzel 2004), and &ldquo;Bright Futures in Practice&rdquo; (Casmassimo, 
                P. and K. Holt 2004).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
          <p>Thirteen percent of grantees reported using OHI funds to develop 
                a compilation of resources and materials on oral health.&nbsp; 
            These grantees reported researching evidence-based curricula and 
            resources, determining the curricula and resources most appropriate 
            for the families they serve, and compiling the materials and resources 
            they found most useful for their program.&nbsp; These materials 
                and resources were used to train Head Start staff and parents 
                and to create packets of information for Head Start teachers and 
                family service workers.&nbsp; Two of these grantees described 
                developing resources and materials on oral health as the main 
                focus of the OHI.&nbsp; One developed and piloted a comprehensive 
                curriculum, which includes components for children, pregnant women, 
                and parents, which it will implement in all Head Start centers 
                in the 2007-2008 program year.&nbsp; The other grantee collaborated 
                with community partners to develop and produce videos/DVDs and 
                booklets about oral health for families.&nbsp; The materials were 
                developed in English and Spanish and at a reading level that is 
                accessible to parents.&nbsp; </p>
          <p>An important consideration for grantees when selecting or developing 
                curricula was finding materials that were culturally and linguistically 
                appropriate for the populations they served. Grantees often reported 
                selecting specific curricula because the materials were available 
                in Spanish or were at an appropriate reading level for parents.&nbsp; 
            In order to serve all families, grantees translated materials 
            into other languages, such as Arabic, and developed materials 
            at third-grade reading levels.&nbsp; One oral health specialist 
                serving a program with a high percentage of families from Mexico 
                and Colombia accessed resources from the departments of health 
                and dental associations in those countries via the Internet to 
                share with families.</p>
          <h4>Establishing Dental Homes</h4>
          <p> Establishing a dental home is an important step in increasing access 
            to care and implementing a schedule of routine preventive care and 
            treatment if needed for children and families.&nbsp; Head Start Program 
            Performance Standards require that Head Start grantees in collaboration 
            with parents and as quickly as possible, but no later than 90 calendar 
            days from the child&rsquo;s entry into the program, make a determination 
            as to whether or not each child has an ongoing source of continuous, 
            accessible health care.&nbsp; If a child does not have a source of 
            ongoing health care, grantees must assist the parents in accessing 
            a source of care (Administration for Children and Families 2007).&nbsp; 
            The National Head Start Oral Health Resource Center defines a dental 
            home as &ldquo;the ongoing relationship between the dentist and the 
            patient, inclusive of all aspects of oral health care delivered in 
            a comprehensive, continuously accessible, coordinated, and family-centered 
            way&rdquo; (National Head Start Oral Health Resource Center 2007).</p>
          <p>When asked during telephone interviews how they defined a dental 
            home, 62 percent of grantees reported a dental home as an ongoing, 
            regular, or continuous source of care.&nbsp; In addition, staff at 
            29 percent of grantees included in their definitions that&nbsp; dental 
            homes must provide comprehensive care, including both preventive and 
            treatment services as needed.&nbsp; Staff at another 15 percent of 
            grantees defined a dental home as providing accessible care; that 
            is, families are easily able to make appointments and receive care 
            in cases of emergencies.&nbsp; Mobile clinics or vans, therefore, 
            do not meet this definition.&nbsp; Other important characteristics 
            of dental homes cited by grantees included that care was affordable 
            (6 percent) and culturally appropriate (6 percent) and that dental 
            providers were willing to accept other family members in addition 
            to the Head Start child (4 percent).</p>
          <p>Data on establishment of dental homes as reported by grantees through 
            the record-keeping system illustrate the difficulties grantees face 
            finding dental homes for families.&nbsp; Through May 2007, some 50 
            percent of children and 20 percent of pregnant women had established 
            dental homes (Table III.2).<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"class="superscript" id="_ftnref2">2</a>&nbsp; 
            These rates are lower than national Head Start averages,<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"class="superscript" id="_ftnref3">3</a> 
            likely attributable to the high need of these grantees to improve 
            oral health care (Hamm 2006).&nbsp; Of children and pregnant women 
            with a dental home, about half had a dental home established before 
            enrolling in Head Start.&nbsp; Over one-third of dental homes were 
            established within the first three months of program enrollment. </p>

          <p>Meeting the requirement to establish a dental home in communities 
            with limited dental providers, specifically finding providers willing 
            to serve young children and accept Medicaid, is challenging.&nbsp; 
            In order to meet this challenge, 85 percent of grantees reported helping 
            families establish a dental home for children.&nbsp; Of these, 35 
            percent described establishing dental homes as a major goal or objective 
            of the OHI.&nbsp; Most of these grantees were already carrying out 
            these activities prior to the OHI but are focusing the grant resources 
            to further support this component.&nbsp; The main strategy grantees 
            described using to help families establish dental homes for children 
            was referring them to local dentists; often these were dentists that 
            the grantees had established partnerships with (see box).&nbsp; Another 
            12 percent of grantees reported partnering with a specific provider 
            or network of providers that could provide dental homes for all Head 
            Start children.<br />

            Four percent of grantees described establishing dental homes for all 
            Head Start families as unrealistic given the limited number of dental 
            providers in their communities who accept clients with Medicaid.&nbsp; 
            Migrant/Seasonal Head Start grantees were more likely than other grantees 
            to report on the limited opportunities to establish a dental home 
            because of the high migration rate of families.&nbsp; These grantees 
            explained that because many families are in the area for only a limited 
            amount of time each year, and Medicaid benefits are not portable to 
            other states, even families with dental homes were likely to spend 
            a significant part of the year with limited or no access to dental 
            services.</p>
          <h4>Preventive and Treatment Oral Health Services</h4>
          <p> Paramount to the prevention and early detection of early childhood 
            dental caries is the provision of preventive oral health services.&nbsp; 
            Risk assessments and the provision of needed followup and treatment 
            are identified as key components to preventing dental caries (American 
            Academy of Pediatrics 2003).&nbsp; To promote oral health, grantees 
            provided or assisted families in receiving risk assessments, preventive 
            services, and treatment services.</p>
          <h4>Risk Assessments</h4>
          <p> Individual risk assessments are especially important for Head Start 
            children, who are often at higher risk for dental disease.&nbsp; Risk-assessment 
            recommendations for Head Start children and pregnant women include 
            identifying previous caries experience, precavity lesions, and visible 
            plaque, as well as perceived risk by examiners (Kanellis 2000).&nbsp; 
            According to the American Academy of Pediatrics &ldquo;Oral Health 
            Risk Assessment Timing and Establishment of the Dental Home Policy 
            Statement&rdquo; (2003), every child should begin to receive oral 
            health risk assessments by age 6 months by a qualified pediatrician 
            or pediatric health care professional.&nbsp; Risk assessment tools, 
            such as the Caries Risk Assessment Tool (American Academy of Pediatric 
            Dentistry 2006), are available to assist health care professionals 
            in determining the patient&rsquo;s relative risk of caries. In the 
            case of the very young patient, a risk assessment to identify parents 
            (usually mothers) and infants with a high predisposition to caries 
            can easily be performed by taking a simple dental history from a new 
            mother. Questions directed at dietary practices, fluoride exposure, 
            oral hygiene, utilization of dental services, and the number and location 
            of the mother&rsquo;s dental fillings can give a relative indication 
            of the mother&rsquo;s baseline decay potential. Frequent sugar intake, 
            low fluoride exposure, poor oral hygiene practices, infrequent utilization 
            of dental services, active decay, and multiple dental fillings in 
            multiple quadrants of the mouth indicate a high caries risk in the 
            mother (American Academy of Pediatrics 2003). </p>
          <p>More than half of the OHI grantees (63 percent) reported conducting 
            risk assessments for Head Start children and pregnant women.&nbsp; 
            Another 31 percent reported referring children and pregnant women 
            to dental homes or other dental providers for risk assessments; however 
            one-quarter of these did provide risk assessments if children and 
            pregnant women did not have dental homes.&nbsp; Ten percent of grantees 
            did not provide or refer children for formal risk assessments.&nbsp; 
            These grantees explained that assessments were not necessary because 
            all of the children they serve are considered high risk.&nbsp; One 
            grantee explained that an oral health task force at the program was 
            in the process of researching the best approach to providing risk 
            assessments.</p>
          <p>The results of risk assessments typically categorize children and 
            pregnant women into specific risk categories, such as high risk, moderate 
            risk, and low risk.&nbsp; Once a risk category was applied, grantees 
            reported using this information to triage children and pregnant women 
            for services.&nbsp; Children and pregnant women categorized as high 
            risk were referred for immediate attention by a dental professional; 
            those at moderate risk were referred to a dental professional, although 
            services were considered less urgent; and those identified as low 
            risk were instructed to continue routine preventive dental treatments.&nbsp; 
            Head Start grantees also used risk assessment results to tailor education 
            and treatment plans for individual families and to track progress 
            of care. </p>
          <h4>Preventive and Treatment Services</h4>
          <p>To meet the oral health needs of children and pregnant women, grantees 
            implemented a range of strategies to obtain preventive services and 
            needed follow-up treatments.&nbsp; Grantees&rsquo; strategies included 
            direct provision of services, referrals for services, and a combination 
            of the two.&nbsp; During telephone interviews, most grantees (77 percent) 
            reported providing some preventive services; nearly all grantees (92 
            percent) referred children and pregnant women to dental professionals 
            for treatment services.&nbsp; </p>
          <p>Grantees commonly planned to provide or arrange dental screenings 
            and fluoride treatments (including varnish applications, rinses, and 
            prescription tablets).&nbsp; Fewer grantees provided cleanings and 
            dental examinations; instead, families were typically referred to 
            dental homes or another dental provider for these services.&nbsp; 
            Eight percent of grantees reported providing some treatment services, 
            such as fillings. Grantees that provided some treatment services either 
            operated or partnered with an organization that operated a mobile 
            van, provided on-site dental clinics, or designated clinic days when 
            appointments were made for Head Start children.&nbsp; All grantees 
            referred families to dental providers for more extensive restorative 
            treatments.&nbsp; </p>
          <p>According to program record-keeping system data, 34 percent of children 
            received at least one service between February and May 2007; 25 percent 
            received more than one service (Table III.3).&nbsp; For pregnant women, 
            the rates were lower with 17 percent receiving one service and 13 
            percent receiving more than one service.&nbsp; The most common types 
            of services children received were fluoride varnishes (22 percent), 
            followed by dental screenings (11 percent) and dental exams (15 percent).&nbsp; 
            Ten percent of pregnant women received dental screenings; 7 percent 
            received dental exams and cleanings.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"class="superscript" id="_ftnref4">4</a> 
            Far fewer children and pregnant women received treatment services, 
            but of those who did, most received fillings. </p>

          <p>The delivery of services was conducted by a variety of providers, 
            most often by a community partner (56 percent of services; Table III.4).&nbsp; 
            Dental hygienists on staff or under contract to grantees provided 
            one-quarter of preventive services.&nbsp; Typically, these hygienists 
            were under the supervision of a dentist; many of these dentists were 
            also community partners or within the network of dentists serving 
            Head Start children.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"class="superscript" id="_ftnref5">5</a> Other grantees contracted with private dental hygienists, 
            partnered with dental hygienist students, or worked with dental hygienists 
            who volunteered their time.&nbsp; </p>
          <p>The primary location at which 
            children and pregnant women received services varied by type of service, 
            but nearly all services were provided either at the grantee site or 
            at a provider office (Table III.4).&nbsp; Most preventive services 
            were conducted at the grantee site; in contrast, treatment services 
            more commonly were delivered at provider offices.&nbsp; Models for 
            providing services on site included having dental hygienists or dentists 
            conduct services in classrooms or arranging for dental providers to 
            offer on-site clinic days when families could make appointments for 
            children.&nbsp; A few grantees reported partnering with organizations 
            that operate mobile dental vans.&nbsp; The vans would visit various 
            Head Start centers or other community locations to offer services 
            to children.&nbsp; To support these on-site services, grantees used 
            OHI funds to purchase portable dental equipment and other supplies.</p>
          <p>Follow-up treatment was required 
            for about one-quarter of the services and was completed on close to 
            20 percent of these services (Table III.4).&nbsp; For the majority 
            of follow-up services, appointments were pending.&nbsp; This status 
            likely reflects the short data collection window (February through 
            May 2007), compounded by long waiting lists for appointments at many 
            dental offices and clinics.</p>
          <p>According to record-keeping 
            system data, grantees referred children and pregnant women to about 
            two-thirds of services (Table III.4).&nbsp; During telephone interviews, 
            nearly all grantees (94 percent) reported having a system in place 
            for referring families to dental providers.&nbsp; Grantees usually 
            maintained lists of providers who were willing to serve Head Start 
            families.&nbsp; As needed, programs would share the list with families.&nbsp; 
            One grantee included the names and contact information of providers 
            willing to serve Head Start families in a community resource guide 
            that was given to families at enrollment.&nbsp; Another grantee operated 
            a referral hotline that families could call when they needed referrals 
            for all health care, including dental care.&nbsp; All grantees reported 
            having a system for referring families to dental providers in place 
            prior to the OHI; however, a few grantees aimed to improve this system 
            through the OHI, and nearly all grantees planned to expand the network 
            of dental providers willing to accept referrals through the OHI.&nbsp; 
            One grantee worked with a community partner to refer clients to services.&nbsp; 
            The community partner operated a referral network, and outreach workers 
            communicated directly with Head Start families to help them locate 
            providers.&nbsp; When making referrals, grantees stressed the importance 
            of finding providers who could work with families&rsquo; characteristics 
            and needs.&nbsp; These factors included ensuring that providers accepted 
            families&rsquo; insurance coverage; were in convenient locations; 
            and, when possible, provided culturally competent services, such as 
            having staff or interpreters available for families that spoke a language 
            other than English.</p>
          <p>To cover the costs of services, 
            staff described four main approaches in telephone interviews: (1) 
            billing Medicaid or another insurance provider, (2) receiving in-kind 
            donations of dental professional time, (3) using OHI funds for materials/supplies/equipment, 
            and (4) using OHI/Head Start funds for services.&nbsp; The cost of 
            treatment services was almost always covered by health insurance, 
            including Medicaid, SCHIP, and Indian Health Services, or paid for 
            using regular Head Start funds.&nbsp; Some grantees reported using 
            OHI funds as additional funding or back-up funding.&nbsp; Few grantees 
            reported using OHI funds as a primary source of funding for oral health 
            services.</p>

          <p>To facilitate the provision of preventive and treatment services, 
            grantees reported providing a range of support services.&nbsp; Of 
            the dental services recorded in the record-keeping system, support 
            services were provided to families for more than one-third of oral 
            health preventive and/or treatment services (Table III.4).&nbsp; Grantee 
            health specialists were typically responsible for providing or arranging 
            these services (51 percent).&nbsp; Other grantee staff, such as family 
            service workers and home visitors, also assisted with providing support 
            services to families.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
            &nbsp;<br />
            In telephone interviews grantees reported that the types of support 
            services available to families included providing transportation or 
            transportation assistance, helping families make appointments, providing 
            or arranging for interpreters, sending out reminder notices or making 
            reminder calls to families about appointments, and accompanying families 
            to appointments (see box).&nbsp; On a more limited basis, grantees 
            reported reimbursing families for the cost of child care during appointments 
            and providing funding to cover the costs of travel and lodging for 
            overnight stays.&nbsp; Grantees also reported helping families access 
            services available through providers and others, such as shuttle services 
            for Medicaid clients and interpreters available through providers.&nbsp;          </p>
          <h4>Distribution of Supplies</h4>
          <p> Oral hygiene supplies were distributed to families to reinforce educational 
            messages and to ensure that families had the tools they needed to 
            engage in healthy dental hygiene.&nbsp; According to record-keeping 
            system data, 78 percent of grantees distributed supplies to Head Start 
            children between February and May 2007 (Table III.5).&nbsp; In telephone 
            interviews with grantee staff, 92 percent of grantees reported distributing 
            supplies at some point during the program year.&nbsp; The primary 
            recipients of oral hygiene supplies were children.&nbsp; In addition, 
            more than half of the grantees also distributed supplies to parents 
            and siblings.&nbsp; Supplies were commonly distributed at parent meetings 
            and training events when oral health topics were discussed during 
            home visits, and were sent home with children.&nbsp; Grantees also 
            distributed supplies at community events.&nbsp; </p>
          <p>The types of supplies distributed to families included toothbrushes, 
            toothpaste, dental floss, timers, toothbrush covers, disclosing tablets 
            that expose plaque on teeth, xylitol products, gauze and finger cloths 
            for wiping infants&rsquo; gums, and dental mirrors for parents to 
            use to check children&rsquo;s teeth (Table III.5). </p>

          <p><span class="small"><strong><a name="_ftn2"id="_ftn2">2</a></strong> Regional differences existed in the rates of children and pregnant women with  dental homes established, with more than half of children reported as having  dental homes in regions III, VIII, IX, and X, compared to less than half in  other regions.&nbsp; Across all regions, grantees  reported higher percentages of dental homes established for children than for  pregnant women.&nbsp; This disparity may  reflect the difficulties that adults on Medicaid and other public insurance  have finding dental care.

          <p><span class="small"><strong><a name="_ftn4"id="_ftn4">4</a></strong> These findings are likely due to the timing of the data collection period  (February through May) and the fact that grantees often provided fluoride  varnishes two to three times per year.&nbsp;  Dental exams and screenings were more commonly provided at the beginning  of the program year.
