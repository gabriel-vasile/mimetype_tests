									<p>WASHINGTON – The Transportation and Housing and Urban Development (THUD) Appropriations Conference Committee today approved a measure that, thanks in part to the efforts of Senators Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman, will provide funding to help improve surface transportation, rail transit and promote affordable housing and community development in Connecticut and across the country.  Dodd and Lieberman worked with their Senate and House colleagues to ensure that funds for a number of Connecticut projects remained in the bill providing more than $55 million in new federal funds for transportation and housing initiatives statewide.     <P>
     <P>
Included in the spending package is $4.22 billion for Community Development Block Grants to states. The CDBG program, which is administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, was created in 1974. CDBG provides resources for community development projects that benefit low- and moderate-income residents including support for local health and senior services, housing rehabilitation, and improvements to parks and public facilities. President Bush announced earlier this year that he had plans to eliminate funding for the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program in his FY 06 budget.  Senators Dodd and Lieberman, along with other congressional colleagues, successfully fought to keep the CDBG program alive.     <P>
     <P>
The conference report also appropriates $1.3 billion for Amtrak despite the Administration’s effort to eliminate all funding for the passenger railroad.  Though Senators Dodd and Lieberman applaud this funding level, they expressed concern over a provision in the conference report allowing the Secretary of Transportation to determine user-fees for commuter railroads that operate along the Amtrak-owned Northeast Corridor.    <P>
     <P>
“I’m proud to help secure more than $55 million for community redevelopment efforts and transportation improvements across Connecticut. Our communities are the best in the country and this funding will help them continue to thrive and live up to their full potential,” said Dodd.    <P>
     <P>
"This bill is good news for Connecticut," Lieberman said. "The funding approved today will make significant strides in improving Connecticut's commute on our highway, rail and transit systems. This bill also helps support redevelopment and modernization initiatives by restoring community development funds and funding other key state projects.”    <P>
     <P>
The funding was included as part of the annual appropriations bill that covers the Departments of Transportation and Housing and Urban Development for fiscal year 2006.  Below are the Connecticut projects included in the bill, which now goes to the President for his signature. Non-transit highway and transportation projects will not be decided on until the final stage of conference committee:    <P>
