    without substantive change, laws enacted before September 5, 1998,
    that were replaced by section 1. Section 1 may not be construed as
    making a substantive change in the laws replaced.
      "(2) Laws enacted after September 4, 1998, that are inconsistent
    with this Act supersede this Act to the extent of the
    inconsistency.

    corresponding provision enacted by this Act until repealed,

      "(d) Actions and Offenses Under Prior Law. - An action taken or
    an offense committed under a law replaced by this Act is deemed to
    have been taken or committed under the corresponding provision
    enacted by this Act.
      "(e) Inferences. - An inference of a legislative construction is
    not to be drawn by reason of the location in the United States Code
    of a provision enacted by this Act or by reason of a heading of the
    provision.
      "(f) Severability. - If a provision enacted by this Act is held
    invalid, all valid provisions that are severable from the invalid
    provision remain in effect. If a provision enacted by this Act is

    1997, that were replaced by those sections. Those sections may not
    be construed as making a substantive change in the laws replaced.
    Laws enacted after August 15, 1997, that are inconsistent with this
    Act supersede this Act to the extent of the inconsistency.
      "(b) References. - A reference to a law replaced by section 1 or

    other law, is deemed to refer to the corresponding provision
    enacted by this Act.

    an offense committed under a law replaced by section 1 or 2 of this
    Act is deemed to have been taken or committed under the
    corresponding provision enacted by this Act.
      "(e) Inferences. - An inference of a legislative construction is
    not to be drawn by reason of the location in the United States Code
    of a provision enacted by this Act or by reason of a caption or
    catch line of the provision.
      "(f) Severability. - If a provision enacted by this Act is held
    invalid, all valid provisions that are severable from the invalid
    provision remain in effect. If a provision enacted by this Act is

      "Congress makes the following findings:
        "(1) Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President, was one of the
      Nation's most prominent leaders, demonstrating true courage
      during the Civil War, one of the greatest crises in the Nation's
      history.
        "(2) Born of humble roots in Hardin County, Kentucky, on
      February 12, 1809, Abraham Lincoln rose to the Presidency through
      a legacy of honesty, integrity, intelligence, and commitment to
      the United States.
        "(3) With the belief that all men were created equal, Abraham
      Lincoln led the effort to free all slaves in the United States.
        "(4) Abraham Lincoln had a generous heart, with malice toward
      none and with charity for all.
        "(5) Abraham Lincoln gave the ultimate sacrifice for the
      country Lincoln loved, dying from an assassin's bullet on April
      15, 1865.
        "(6) All Americans could benefit from studying the life of
      Abraham Lincoln, for Lincoln's life is a model for accomplishing
      the 'American Dream' through honesty, integrity, loyalty, and a
      lifetime of education.
        "(7) The year 2009 will be the bicentennial anniversary of the
      birth of Abraham Lincoln, and a commission should be established

      Each year we Americans set aside one day to honor the brave and

      They serve our nation with dignity, courage, and pride in duty

    of the United States.
      I also invite national and local veterans, civic and other
    organizations to join in the observance of Armed Forces Day each
    year.
      I call upon all Americans not only to display the flag of the
    United States at their homes on Armed Forces Day, but also to learn
    about our system of defense, and about the men and women who
    sustain it, by attending and participating in the local observances
    of the day.
      Proclamation 4571 of May 15, 1978, is hereby superseded.

    of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred
    and sixth.

        "(4) the relevance of Memorial Day must be made more apparent
      to present and future generations of people of the United States
      through local and national observances and ongoing activities;

      2000, Congress called on the people of the United States, in a
      symbolic act of unity, to observe a National Moment of
      Remembrance to honor the men and women of the United States who
      died in the pursuit of freedom and peace;
        "(6) in Presidential Proclamation No. 7315 of May 26, 2000 (65

     PROC. NO. 5574. THE ROSE PROCLAIMED THE NATIONAL FLORAL EMBLEM OF
                       THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
      Proc. No. 5574, Nov. 20, 1986, 51 F.R. 42197, provided:
      Americans have always loved the flowers with which God decorates
    our land. More often than any other flower, we hold the rose dear
    as the symbol of life and love and devotion, of beauty and
    eternity. For the love of man and woman, for the love of mankind
    and God, for the love of country, Americans who would speak the
    language of the heart do so with a rose.
      We see proofs of this everywhere. The study of fossils reveals
    that the rose has existed in America for age upon age. We have
    always cultivated roses in our gardens. Our first President, George
    Washington, bred roses, and a variety he named after his mother is
    still grown today. The White House itself boasts a beautiful Rose
    Garden. We grow roses in all our fifty States. We find roses
    throughout our art, music, and literature. We decorate our
    celebrations and parades with roses. Most of all, we present roses
    to those we love, and we lavish them on our altars, our civil
    shrines, and the final resting places of our honored dead.
      The American people have long held a special place in their
    hearts for roses. Let us continue to cherish them, to honor the
    love and devotion they represent, and to bestow them on all we love
    just as God has bestowed them on us.
      The Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 159 [Pub. L. 99-449, now
    this section], has designated the rose as the National Floral
    Emblem of the United States and authorized and requested the
    President to issue a proclamation declaring this fact.
      NOW, THEREFORE, I, RONALD REAGAN, President of the United States
    of America, do hereby proclaim the rose as the National Floral
    Emblem of the United States of America.
      IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth
    day of November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and
    eighty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America
    the two hundred and eleventh.
                                                          Ronald Reagan.

      In this chapter, the word "Mayor" is substituted for
    "Commissioners" in the Presidential Inaugural Ceremonies Act (ch.
    974, 70 Stat. 1049) [subsequently changed to "Commissioner" in
    36:ch. 30 because section 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967
    (5 App. U.S.C.) transferred the functions of the Board of
    Commissioners of the District of Columbia to the Commissioner of
    the District of Columbia and because of 36:730] because of sections
    421 and 711 of the District of Columbia Self-Government and
    Governmental Reorganization Act (Public Law 93-198, 87 Stat. 789,
    818), which abolished the office of Commissioner of the District of
    Columbia and replaced it with the office of Mayor of the District
    of Columbia.
      In this section, the text of 36:721(b)(3)-(5) is omitted because
    the complete names of the Mayor of the District of Columbia and the
    Secretaries of Defense and of the Interior are used the first time
    the terms appear in a section.

-STATUTE-
      Congress finds that - 
        (1) Federal lands, parks, recreation areas, and waterways
      provide recreational opportunities for millions of Americans each
      year;
        (2) Federal lands administered by Federal land management
      agencies contain valuable wildlife, scenery, natural and historic
      features, and other resources which may be damaged by litter and
      misuse;
        (3) it is in the best interest of the United States and its
      citizens to maintain and preserve the beauty, safety, and
      availability of these Federal lands;
        (4) these Federal land management agencies have been designated
      as the caretakers of these Federal lands and are responsible for
      maintaining and preserving those areas and facilities;
        (5) there is great value in volunteer involvement in
      maintaining and preserving Federal lands for recreational use;
        (6) the Federal land management agencies should be concerned
      with promoting a sense of pride and ownership among citizens
      toward these lands;
        (7) the use of citizen volunteers in a national cleanup effort
      promotes these goals and encourages the thoughtful use of these
      Federal lands and facilities;
        (8) the positive impact of annual cleanup events held at
      various recreation sites has already been proven by steadily
      declining levels of litter at these sites; and
        (9) a national program for cleaning and maintaining Federal
      lands using volunteers will save millions of tax dollars.

      In subsection (b), the text of section 1084(c) of the National
    Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1992 and 1993 (Public
    Law 102-190, 105 Stat. 1483) is omitted as executed.

                              PUB. L. 105-354                          
      This amends section 902 of title 36 to reflect changes made by

    App. U.S.C. 189a).
      Section 1082(g) of that Act, which defined "POW/MIA flag" as used
    in section 1082 by reference to section 2 of Public Law 101-355, is
    unnecessary because the two provisions are restated together in
    section 902 of title 36.
      Section 1082(h), which required that regulations be prescribed no
    later than 180 days after enactment of Public law 105-85, is
    repealed as executed.
      Section 1082(i), which required that the Administrator of GSA
    procure and distribute POW/MIA flags no later than 30 days after
    enactment of Public Law 105-85, is repealed as executed.
      Section 1082(j), which repealed section 1084 of Public Law 102-
    190 (previously restated as subsections (b) and (c) of section 902
    of title 36), is repealed as executed.

    respectively.
      Subsec. (d)(3). Pub. L. 107-323, Sec. 2(a), substituted "The
    World War II Memorial, the Korean War Veterans Memorial, and the
    Vietnam Veterans Memorial" for "The Korean War Veterans Memorial
    and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial".
      1998 - Subsecs. (b) to (g). Pub. L. 105-354 added subsecs. (b) to
    (g) and struck out former subsecs. (b) and (c) which read as
    follows:
      "(b) Display. - The flag shall be displayed - 
        "(1) at each national cemetery and at the National Vietnam
      Veterans Memorial each year on Memorial Day and Veterans Day and
      on any day designated by law as National POW/MIA Recognition Day;
      and
        "(2) on, or on the grounds of, the buildings containing the
      primary offices of the Secretaries of State, Defense, and
      Veterans Affairs, and the Director of the Selective Service
      System on any day designated by law as National POW/MIA
      Recognition Day.
      "(c) Termination of Flag Display Requirement. - Subsection (b) of
    this section ceases to apply when the President decides that the
    fullest possible accounting has been made of all members of the
    Armed Forces and civilian employees of the United States Government
    who have been identified as prisoners of war or missing in action
    in Southeast Asia."

                       DISPLAY ON EXISTING FLAGPOLE                   
      Pub. L. 107-323, Sec. 2(c), Dec. 4, 2002, 116 Stat. 2788,
    provided that: "No element of the United States Government may

      In subsection (a), the words "from time to time" are omitted as
    unnecessary.
      In subsection (b), before clause (1), the text of 36:121 (last
    par.) is omitted as executed. In clauses (2) and (3), the word
    "same" is omitted as unnecessary. In clause (2), the words
    "authorized to be paid" are substituted for "prescribed" for
    consistency with clause (3) and 37:405.
      Subsection (c) is based on 36:122 which is from the 2d proviso in
    the paragraph under the heading "American Battle Monuments
    Commission" in title III of the Departments of Veterans Affairs and
    Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies
    Appropriations Act, 1997 (Public Law 104-204, 110 Stat. 2907). The
    provision has been repeated each year in prior appropriations acts
    and therefore is restated as a permanent provision. For prior
    provisions, see citations under 36:122 (1994 ed.). In the
    restatement, the words "in the same way as" are substituted for "as
    provided for" for clarity and consistency in the revised title.

      In subsection (a) before clause (1), the words "or
    appropriations" are omitted because of 1:1. The words "further" and
    "under the jurisdiction of the Commission" are omitted as
    unnecessary. In clause (2), the words "who shall be hired for local
    employment relating to the care and maintenance of such cemeteries,
    monuments, and memorials" are omitted as unnecessary.
      Subsections (b) and (c) are based in part on 36:121b and 122a,

    the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban
    Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 1997
    (Public Law 104-204, 110 Stat. 2907). The provisions have been
    repeated each year in prior appropriations acts and therefore are
    restated as permanent provisions. For prior provisions, see
    citations under 36:121b and 122a (1994 ed.).
      In subsection (b), the words "departments, agencies, and
    instrumentalities" are substituted for "departments or agencies"
    and "departments, agencies, and services" in 36:121 and "agencies"
    in 36:122a for consistency in the revised title and with other
    titles of the United States Code. The words "or of the Army, Navy,
    Air Force, or Marine Corps" in 36:121 and "including the Armed
    Forces" in 36:122a are omitted as included in "department, agency,
    or instrumentality". The words "as the case may be" in 36:121 are
    omitted as unnecessary. The word "salary" in 36:122a is omitted as
    included in "pay".
      In subsection (c), the words "Secretary of the Army" are
    substituted for "Department of the Army" because of 10:3013(a)(1).

      In this section, the word "terms" is omitted as included in
    "conditions".
      In subsection (a), before clause (1), the words "or
    appropriations" are omitted because of 1:1. In clauses (1) and (5),
    the words "duties and powers" are substituted for "functions" for
    consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the
    United States Code. In clause (2), the words "department, agency,
    or instrumentality" are substituted for "departments" for
    consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the Code.
      In subsection (b), the text of 36:137 is omitted as superseded.
    The words "which has been or may after June 26, 1946, be" and
    "Provided, That this subsection shall not be effective until the
    expiration of the Surplus Property Act of 1944" are omitted as
    obsolete. Section 38 of the Surplus Property Act of 1944 (ch. 479,
    58 Stat. 784) provided that the Act was to expire 3 years after the
    cessation of hostilities of World War II. The cessation of
    hostilities was proclaimed on December 31, 1946, by Proclamation
    No. 2714, 12 Fed. Reg. 1. However, section 602(a)(1) of the Federal
    Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (ch. 288, 63 Stat.
    399) [renumbered by section 6(a) and (b) of the Act of September 5,
    1950 (ch. 849, 64 Stat. 583)] repealed the Surplus Property Act of
    1944 effective July 1, 1949 (except for sections 13(d), (g), and
    (h), 28, and 32(b)(2)). Section 13(d), concerning power
    transmission lines, and section 13(g), concerning property for
    public airports, do not involve the American Battle Monuments
    Commission. Section 13(h) was repealed by section 2 of the Act of
    August 4, 1972 (Public Law 92-362, 86 Stat. 504). Section 28 was
    repealed by section 21 of the Act of June 25, 1948 (ch. 645, 62
    Stat. 868). Section 32(b)(2) was repealed by section 111(a)(1) of
    the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961 (Public
    Law 87-256, 75 Stat. 538).
      In subsection (c), the words "in its discretion", "by contract or
    otherwise", and "firms of architects" are omitted as unnecessary.

-STATUTE-
      When, as a result of combat operations, the Armed Forces
    establish military cemeteries in zones of operations outside the
    United States and the territories and possessions of the United
    States, the American Battle Monuments Commission and the Secretary
    of the Army, immediately on the cessation of hostilities, shall
    decide which of the cemeteries will become permanent cemeteries or,
    if they decide it is desirable, shall select new sites for the
    cemeteries at any other location. The Commission is solely
    responsible for the design and construction of the permanent
    cemeteries, and of all buildings, plantings, headstones, and other
    permanent improvements incidental to the cemeteries, except that - 
        (1) the Armed Forces are responsible for maintaining the
      permanent cemeteries until the Commission declares its readiness
      to assume the authorized administrative duties and powers;
        (2) all construction undertaken by the Armed Forces in
      establishing and maintaining the cemetery prior to its transfer
      to the Commission shall be nonpermanent;
        (3) burials and reburials by the Armed Forces shall be carried
      out in accordance with plans prepared by the Commission; and
        (4) the Armed Forces have the right to re-enter a cemetery
      transferred to the Commission to exhume or re-inter a body if
      they decide it is necessary.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 2106. War memorials not built by the United States Government

-STATUTE-
      (a) Cooperation With Others. - The American Battle Monuments
    Commission may cooperate with citizens of the United States,
    States, municipalities, or associations desiring to build war
    memorials outside the continental limits of the United States in
    the way the Commission decides. An administrative agency of the
    United States Government may give assistance to build the memorial
    only if a plan for the memorial has been approved under this
    chapter.
      (b) Control, Administration, and Maintenance of War Memorials. -
    (1) The Commission may assume responsibility for the control,
    administration, and maintenance of any war memorial built outside
    the United States by a citizen of the United States, a State, a
    political subdivision of a State, a governmental authority (except
    a department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States
    Government), a foreign agency, or a private association to
    commemorate the services of any of the Armed Forces in hostilities
    occurring since April 6, 1917, if - 
        (A) the memorial is not built on the territory of the
      applicable former enemy; and
        (B) the sponsors of the memorial consent to the Commission
      assuming those responsibilities and transfer to the Commission
      all their rights and interests in the memorial.

      (2) If reasonable effort fails to locate the sponsors of a
    memorial, the Commission may assume responsibility for the memorial
    under this subsection by agreement with the appropriate foreign
    authorities. A decision of the Commission to assume responsibility
    for a war memorial under this subsection is final.
      (3) Sponsors of a war memorial for which the Commission assumes
    responsibility under this subsection may transfer amounts
    accumulated to maintain and repair the memorial to the Commission
    for use in carrying out this chapter. Except as provided in
    subsection (c) of this section, the Commission shall deposit
    transferred amounts as provided in section 2103(e) of this title.
      (c) Arrangements for Repair or Long-Term Maintenance of
    Memorials. - In assuming responsibility for a war memorial under
    subsection (b)(1) or (2) of this section, the Commission may
    arrange with the sponsors of the memorial to provide for repair or
    long-term maintenance of the memorial. An amount transferred to the
    Commission for the purpose of this subsection shall be deposited by
    the Commission in the fund established under subsection (d) of this
    section.
      (d) Fund for Arrangements for Repair or Long-Term Maintenance of
    Memorials. - (1) There is a fund in the Treasury that is available
    to the Commission for expenses of repair and long-term maintenance
    of memorials for which the Commission has made arrangements under
    subsection (c) of this section. The fund consists of - 
        (A) amounts deposited into, and interest and proceeds credited
      to, the fund under paragraph (2) of this subsection; and
        (B) obligations obtained under paragraph (3) of this
      subsection.

      (2) The Commission shall deposit into the fund the amounts that
    are accepted under subsection (c) of this section. The Secretary of
    the Treasury shall credit to the fund the interest on, and the
    proceeds from the sale or redemption of, obligations held in the
    fund.
      (3) The Secretary shall invest any part of the fund that the
    Commission decides is not required to meet current expenses. Each
    investment shall be made in an interest-bearing obligation of the
    United States Government, or an obligation that has its principal
    and interest guaranteed by the Government, that the Commission
    decides has a maturity suitable for the fund.
      (4) The Commission shall separately account for all amounts
    deposited in and expended from the fund for each war memorial for
    which an arrangement for repair or long-term maintenance is made
    under subsection (c) of this section.
      (e) Demolition of War Memorial Built in a Foreign Country and
    Disposition of Site. - The Commission may take necessary action to
    demolish any war memorial built outside the United States by a
    citizen of the United States, a State, a political subdivision of a
    State, a governmental authority (except a department, agency, or
    instrumentality of the United States Government), a foreign agency,
    or a private association and to dispose of the site of the memorial
    in a way the Commission decides is proper, if - 
        (1) the appropriate foreign authorities agree to the
      demolition; and
        (2)(A) the sponsor of the memorial consents to the demolition;
      or
        (B) the memorial has fallen into disrepair and a reasonable
      effort by the Commission has failed - 
          (i) to persuade the sponsor to maintain the memorial at a
        standard acceptable to the Commission; or
          (ii) to locate the sponsor.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 2109. Foreign Currency Fluctuations Account

-STATUTE-
      (a) Establishment and Purpose. - There is an account in the
    Treasury known as the "Foreign Currency Fluctuations, American
    Battle Monuments Commission, Account". The Account shall be used to
    provide amounts, in addition to amounts appropriated for salaries
    and expenses of the Commission, to pay the cost of salaries and
    expenses that exceeds the amount appropriated for salaries and
    expenses because of fluctuations in currency exchange rates of
    foreign countries occurring after a budget request for the
    Commission is submitted to Congress. The Account may not be used
    for any other purpose.
      (b) Increase in Permissible Obligations of Amounts. - A provision
    of law limiting the amounts the Commission may obligate in a fiscal
    year shall be increased to the extent necessary to reflect
    fluctuations in exchange rates from those used in preparing the
    budget submission.
      (c) Transferred Amounts. - (1) Amounts in the Account may be
    transferred to amounts appropriated for salaries and expenses of
    the Commission. Transferred amounts shall be merged with, and are
    available for the same time period as, the appropriation to which
    they are applied.
      (2) Amounts transferred from the Account may be transferred back -
     
        (A) if the amounts are not needed to pay obligations incurred
      because of fluctuations in currency exchange rates of foreign
      countries in the appropriation to which the amounts were
      originally transferred; or
        (B) because of subsequent favorable fluctuations in the rates
      or because other amounts are, or become, available to pay the
      obligations.

      (3) Amounts transferred to an appropriation under this subsection
    may not be transferred back to the Account after the end of the 2d
    fiscal year after the fiscal year in which the appropriation was
    available for obligation.
      (d) Recording of Obligations and Fluctuations in Exchange Rates. -
     An obligation of the Commission payable in the currency of a
    foreign country may be recorded as an obligation based on exchange
    rates used in preparing a budget submission. A change reflecting
    fluctuations in exchange rates may be recorded as a disbursement is
    made.
      (e) Unobligated Balances. - The unobligated balance of an
    appropriation for salaries and expenses may be transferred to the
    Account not later than the end of the second fiscal year following
    the fiscal year for which the appropriation was made. The
    unobligated balance shall be merged with, and be available for the
    same period and purposes as, the Account.
      (f) Annual Report. - The Commission each year shall submit to the
    appropriate committees of Congress a report on amounts transferred
    under this section.
      (g) Authorization of Appropriations. - There is authorized to be
    appropriated $3,000,000 to the Account.

                                            (d), 4(c)(3), 70 Stat. 640,

    --------------------------------------------------------------------

      The words "section 2734 of title 10" and "section 2734" are
    substituted for "the first section of the Act entitled 'An Act to
    provide for the prompt settlement of claims for damages occasioned
    by Army, Navy, and Marine Corps forces in foreign countries',
    approved January 2, 1942 (55 Stat. 880, as amended; 31 U.S.C.
    224d)" and "such Act", respectively, in section 12 (4th par.) of
    the Act of March 4, 1923 (ch. 283), as added by section 4(c)(3) of
    the Act of July 25, 1956 (ch. 721, 70 Stat. 642), because of
    section 49(b) of the Act of August 10, 1956 (ch. 1041, 70A Stat.
    640). The 1942 law enacted former 31:224d, 224h, and 224i. Those
    sections subsequently were codified as 10:2734 and repealed by the
    Act of August 10, 1956 (ch. 1041, 70A Stat. 154, 672). The words
    "both real and personal" are omitted as unnecessary. The words "on
    or after July 25, 1956" are omitted as obsolete. The words "or
    commissions" are omitted because of 1:1. The words "settled,
    decided" are substituted for "considered, ascertained, adjusted,
    determined" to eliminate unnecessary words.

    of the United States Senate (124 Cong. Rec. S3857 of March 16,
    1978) as set forth by Reservations (1) and (3) to the Resolution of
    Ratification of the Treaty Concerning the Permanent Neutrality and
    Operation of the Panama Canal, it is hereby ordered as follows:
      1-101. The Secretary of State shall take all appropriate steps to

    administer as a permanent American cemetery such part of Corozal
    Cemetery as encompasses the remains of citizens of the United
    States of America.
      1-102. Subject to the conclusion of the agreement referred to in

    force of the Neutrality Treaty, and reinter in Corozal Cemetery the
    remains of United States citizens, and the remains of members of

    reinterment.
      1-105. Subject to the availability of funds, all the costs
    incurred in the disinterment, reinterment in Corozal Cemetery, and
    transportation of remains required by this Order, including the
    costs of preparation, cremation if requested, and a casket or urn,
    shall be borne by the United States of America. The costs of
    reinterment in the United States, including any costs for funeral
    home services, vaults, plots, or crypts, will be the responsibility
    of the next of kin making the request, except to the extent
    otherwise provided by law, including any unused specific
    entitlements available pursuant to statute.
      1-106. (a) The Governor of the Canal Zone shall identify, to the

      (b) The Governor shall provide notice to the next of kin of such
    deceased buried in Mount Hope Cemetery that the Government plans to
    remove the deceased to Corozal Cemetery unless the next of kin

    issuance of such notification, either that the remains not be
    removed from Mount Hope Cemetery, or that the remains be moved to,
    and reinterred in, the United States in a cemetery or other burial
    site designated by the next of kin.

    designated by the next of kin, if the next of kin so requests in
    writing not later than April 1, 1982.
      (d) The Governor shall publish the notices provided for in
    subsections (b) and (c) of this Section in appropriate newspapers,
    magazines and other periodicals, and utilize such other means of
    communicating with the next of kin that he finds to be practical
    and effective.
      1-107. The Governor of the Canal Zone shall, before the entry
    into force of the Neutrality Treaty, fully advise the next of kin
    of all available options, and their implications, in those cases
    where a request has been made that remains not be removed from
    Mount Hope Cemetery.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 2113. World War II memorial in the District of Columbia

-STATUTE-
      (a) Solicitation and Acceptance of Contributions. - (1)
    Consistent with its authority under section 2103(e) of this title,
    the American Battle Monuments Commission shall solicit and accept
    contributions for the World War II memorial.
      (2) In this section, the term "World War II memorial" means the
    memorial authorized by Public Law 103-32 (40 U.S.C. 8903 note) to
    be established by the Commission on Federal land in the District of
    Columbia or its environs to honor members of the Armed Forces who
    served in World War II and to commemorate the participation of the
    United States in that war.
      (b) Creation of Memorial Fund. - (1) There is hereby created in
    the Treasury a fund for the World War II memorial, which shall
    consist of the following:
        (A) Amounts deposited, and interest and proceeds credited,
      under paragraph (2).
        (B) Obligations obtained under paragraph (3).
        (C) The amount of surcharges paid to the Commission for the
      World War II memorial under the World War II 50th Anniversary
      Commemorative Coins Act (31 U.S.C. 5112 note).
        (D) Amounts borrowed using the authority provided under
      subsection (d).
        (E) Any funds received by the Commission under section 2114 of
      this title in exchange for use of, or the right to use, any mark,
      copyright or patent.

      (2) The Chairman of the Commission shall deposit in the fund the
    amounts accepted as contributions under subsection (a). The
    Secretary of the Treasury shall credit to the fund the interest on,
    and the proceeds from sale or redemption of, obligations held in
    the fund.
      (3) The Secretary of the Treasury shall invest any portion of the
    fund that, as determined by the Chairman, is not required to meet
    current expenses. Each investment shall be made in an interest-
    bearing obligation of the United States or an obligation
    guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States that,
    as determined by the Chairman, has a maturity suitable for the
    fund.
      (c) Use of Fund. - The fund shall be available to the Commission -

      including the maintenance and preservation amount provided for in
      section 8906(b) of title 40;
        (2) for such other expenses, other than routine maintenance,
      with respect to the World War II memorial as the Commission
      considers warranted; and

      any mark, copyright, or patent that is owned by, assigned to, or
      licensed to the Commission under section 2114 of this title to
      aid or facilitate the construction of the World War II memorial.

      (d) Special Borrowing Authority. - (1) To assure that
    groundbreaking, construction, and dedication of the World War II
    memorial are carried out on a timely basis, the Commission may
    borrow money from the Treasury of the United States in such amounts
    as the Commission considers necessary, but not to exceed a total of
    $65,000,000. Borrowed amounts shall bear interest at a rate
    determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into
    consideration the average market yield on outstanding marketable
    obligations of the United States of comparable maturities during
    the month preceding the month in which the obligations of the
    Commission are issued. The interest payments on such obligations
    may be deferred with the approval of the Secretary, but any
    interest payment so deferred shall also bear interest.
      (2) The borrowing of money by the Commission under paragraph (1)
    shall be subject to such maturities, terms, and conditions as may
    be agreed upon by the Commission and the Secretary, except that the
    maturities may not exceed 20 years and such borrowings may be
    redeemable at the option of the Commission before maturity.
      (3) The obligations of the Commission shall be issued in amounts
    and at prices approved by the Secretary. The authority of the
    Commission to issue obligations under this subsection shall remain
    available without fiscal year limitation. The Secretary of the
    Treasury shall purchase any obligations of the Commission to be
    issued under this subsection, and for such purpose the Secretary of
    the Treasury may use as a public debt transaction of the United
    States the proceeds from the sale of any securities issued under
    chapter 31 of title 31. The purposes for which securities may be
    issued under such chapter are extended to include any purchase of
    the Commission's obligations under this subsection.
      (4) Repayment of the interest and principal on any funds borrowed
    by the Commission under paragraph (1) shall be made from amounts in
    the fund. The Commission may not use for such purpose any funds
    appropriated for any other activities of the Commission.
      (e) Treatment of Borrowing Authority. - In determining whether
    the Commission has sufficient funds to complete construction of the
    World War II memorial, as required by section 8906 of title 40, the
    Secretary of the Interior shall consider the funds that the
    Commission may borrow from the Treasury under subsection (d) as
    funds available to complete construction of the memorial, whether
    or not the Commission has actually exercised the authority to
    borrow such funds.
      (f) Voluntary Services. - (1) Notwithstanding section 1342 of
    title 31, the Commission may accept from any person voluntary
    services to be provided in furtherance of the fund-raising
    activities of the Commission relating to the World War II memorial.
      (2) A person providing voluntary services under this subsection
    shall be considered to be a Federal employee for purposes of
    chapter 81 of title 5, relating to compensation for work-related
    injuries, and chapter 171 of title 28, relating to tort claims. A
    volunteer who is not otherwise employed by the United States shall
    not be considered to be a Federal employee for any other purpose by
    reason of the provision of such voluntary service, except that any
    volunteer given responsibility for the handling of funds or the
    carrying out of a Federal function is subject to the conflict of
    interest laws contained in chapter 11 of title 18 and the
    administrative standards of conduct contained in part 2635 of title
    5 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
      (3) The Commission may provide for reimbursement of incidental
    expenses that are incurred by a person providing voluntary services
    under this subsection. The Commission shall determine those
    expenses that are eligible for reimbursement under this paragraph.
      (4) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require any
    Federal employee to work without compensation or to allow the use
    of volunteer services to displace or replace any Federal employee.
      (g) Treatment of Certain Contracts. - A contract entered into by
    the Commission for the design or construction of the World War II
    memorial is not a funding agreement as that term is defined in
    section 201 of title 35.
      (h) Extension of Authority To Establish Memorial. -
    Notwithstanding section 8903(e) of title 40, the authority for the
    construction of the World War II memorial provided by Public Law
    103-32 (40 U.S.C. 8903 note) expires on December 31, 2005.

-STATUTE-
      (a) General. - Except as otherwise provided, the financial
    statements of each corporation in part B of this subtitle shall be
    audited annually in accordance with generally accepted auditing
    standards by an independent certified public accountant or
    independent licensed public accountant, certified or licensed by a
    regulatory authority of a State or other political subdivision of
    the United States. The audit shall be conducted where the financial
    statements of the corporation normally are kept. The person
    conducting the audit shall be given access to - 
        (1) all records and property owned or used by the corporation
      necessary to facilitate the audit; and
        (2) full facilities for verifying transactions with the
      balances or securities held by depositories, fiscal agents, and
      custodians.

      (b) Report. - (1) The corporation shall submit a report of the
    audit to Congress not later than 6 months after the close of the
    fiscal year for which the audit is made. The report shall describe
    the scope of the audit and include - 
        (A) statements necessary to present fairly the corporation's
      assets, liabilities, and surplus or deficit, and an analysis of
      the changes in those amounts during the year;
        (B) a statement in reasonable detail of the corporation's
      income and expenses during the year including the results of any
      trading, manufacturing, publishing, or other commercial-type
      endeavor; and
        (C) the independent auditor's opinion of those statements.

      (2) The report may not be printed as a public document, except as
    part of proceedings authorized to be printed under section 1332 of
    title 44.

    --------------------------------------------------------------------

      In this section, the text of 36:1101 is omitted as unnecessary
    because of the addition of the words "Except as otherwise provided"
    in subsection (a) of this section. The text of 36:1166, 1213(a),
    and 5206(a) is omitted as unnecessary because of the restatement of
    36:1102 and 1103 as general provisions covering, except as
    otherwise provided, all federally chartered corporations referred
    to in part B of subtitle II of the revised title. The text of
    36:1084 (less (b) (2d sentence cl. (2))), 4315 (less (b) (2d
    sentence cl. (2))), 4514 (less (b) (2d sentence cl. (2))), and 4610
    (less (b) (2d sentence cl. (2))) is omitted as unnecessary because
    of the restatement in this section of the general audit provisions
    of 36:1102 and 1103.
      In subsection (a), before clause (1), the words "Except as
    otherwise provided" are added because certain corporations referred
    to in part B of subtitle II of the revised title are not covered by
    the audit requirements restated in the revised section. The words
    "at the place or places" and "or persons" are omitted as
    unnecessary. The words "financial statements" are substituted for
    "accounts" to use the generally accepted term for audits conducted
    by public accountants. The words "shall be given access to" are
    substituted for "shall be made available to" and "shall be afforded
    to" for consistency. In clause (1), the words "records and property
    owned or used by" are substituted for "books, accounts, financial
    records, reports, files, and all other papers, things, or property
    belonging to or in use by" for consistency in the revised title and

      In subsection (a), the source provisions are restated as a
    general provision to avoid the need to repeat identical provisions.
    The words "but no contract or individual right made or acquired
    shall be divested or impaired" in 36:104 and "but no contract or
    individual right made or acquired shall thereby be divested or
    impaired" in 36:5311 are omitted as unnecessary and for consistency
    in the revised title.
      Subsection (b) is added because the chapters referred to in
    subsection (b) restate laws which Congress did not expressly
    reserve the right to amend or repeal.

      rehabilitation of the disabled veterans of World War II, the
      Korean conflict, and the Vietnam era and to establish facilities
      for the assistance of all veterans and to represent them in their
      claims before the Department of Veterans Affairs and other
      organizations without charge;
        (3) to dedicate ourselves to the service and best interests of
      the community, State, and Nation to the end that our country

        (4) to aid and encourage the abolition of prejudice, ignorance,
      and disease;
        (5) to encourage universal exercise of the voting franchise to
      the end that there shall be elected and maintained in public
      office men and women who hold public office as a public trust
      administered in the best interests of all the people;
        (6) to advocate the development and means by which all
      Americans may become enlightened and informed citizens and thus
      participate fully in the functions of our democracy;

      all peace-loving nations to the end that not again shall any
      nation be permitted to breach their national peace;
        (8) to continue to serve the best interests of our Nation in
      peace as in war;
        (9) to develop to the utmost the human, mental, spiritual, and
      economical resources of our Nation;
        (10) to perpetuate and preserve the friendships and comradeship

      service to our Nation during time of war; and
        (11) to honor the memory of those men and women who gave their
      lives that a free America and a free world might live by the
      creation of living memorials in the form of additional

    Education", in section 18 of the Act of August 30, 1950 (ch. 823,

    approval of the Federal Security Administrator" and "with the
    approval of the Administrator" are omitted because the functions of
    the Federal Security Administrator were transferred to the
    Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare by section 5 of

    subsequently transferred to the Secretary of Education by 20:3441.
    See also 20:3507. Substitution of a reference to the "Secretary of
    Education" would result in a requirement of the Secretary's own
    approval. The word "activities" (the first time it appears) is
    substituted for "business and activities" for consistency in the

      Ex. Ord. No. 2859, May 11, 1918, as amended by Ex. Ord. No.
    10668, May 10, 1956, 21 F.R. 3155; Ex. Ord. No. 12832, Jan. 19,
    1993, 58 F.R. 5905, provided:
      National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences
      WHEREAS (1) the congressional charter of the National Academy of
    Sciences ("Academy") charges it, upon call from any U.S. Government
    Department, to investigate, examine, experiment, and report upon
    any subject of science or art and (2) the actual expenses of the
    Academy for such investigations, examinations, experiments, and
    reports shall be paid to the Academy through one or more of the
    following: private gifts and bequests; appropriations for the
    benefit of the Academy; grants-in-aid, contracts, and other forms
    of financial agreement with executive departments and agencies,
    provided that the Academy shall receive no compensation whatever
    for any services to the Government of the United States; and
      WHEREAS the National Research Council ("Council") was organized
    in 1916 at the request of the President by the National Academy of
    Sciences, under its congressional charter, as a measure of national
    preparedness; and
      WHEREAS the Council is the principal operating agency of the
    National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of
    Engineering, the latter having been established in 1964 under the
    charter of the National Academy of Sciences; and
      WHEREAS the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of
    Sciences, established in 1970 under the Academy's charter, conducts
    its programs and activities under the approval, operating, and
    review procedures of the Council; and
      WHEREAS in recognition of the work accomplished through the
    Council in organizing research, in furthering science, and in
    securing cooperation of government and nongovernment agencies in
    the solution of their problems, the Council has been perpetuated by
    the Academy as requested by the President in Executive Order No.
    2859 of May 11, 1918; and
      WHEREAS the effective prosecution of the Council's work may
    require the close cooperation of the scientific and technical
    branches of the Government, both military and civil, and makes
    participation by officers and employees of the Government in the
    work of the Council desirable; and
      NOW, THEREFORE, by the authority vested in me as President by the
    Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is
    ordered as follows:
      1. The functions of the Council shall be as follows:
      (a) To stimulate research in the mathematical, physical,
    biological, environmental, and social sciences, and in the
    application of these sciences to engineering, agriculture,
    medicine, and other useful arts, with the object of increasing
    knowledge, of strengthening the national security including the
    contribution of science and engineering to economic growth, of
    ensuring the health of the American people, of aiding in the
    attainment of environmental goals, and of contributing in other
    ways to the public welfare.
      (b) To survey the broad possibilities of science, to formulate
    comprehensive projects of research, and to develop effective means
    of utilizing the scientific and technical resources of the country
    for dealing with such projects.
      (c) To promote cooperation in research, at home and abroad, in
    order to secure concentration of effort, minimize duplication, and
    stimulate progress; but in all cooperative undertakings to give
    encouragement to individual initiative, as fundamentally important
    to the advancement of science.
      (d) To serve as a means of bringing American and foreign
    investigators into active cooperation with the scientific and
    technical services of the Federal Government.
      (e) To direct the attention of scientific and technical
    investigators to the importance of military and industrial problems
    in connection with national security, to the importance of
    environmental problems in connection with public health and the
    economy, and to aid in the solution of these problems by organizing
    specific research.
      (f) To gather and collate scientific and technical information,
    at home and abroad, in cooperation with governmental and other
    agencies, and to disseminate such information to duly accredited
    persons and the public.
      2. Scientists, engineers, and other technically qualified
    professionals who are officers or employees of departments and
    agencies of the executive branch of the Government are encouraged
    to participate in the work of the Council as requested by the
    Council to the extent authorized by the head of the officer's or
    employee's agency or department and permitted by law.
      3. To the extent permitted by law and regulation, and in
    accordance with the congressional charter of the Academy, the
    actual expense of investigations, examinations, experiments, and
    reports by the Academy for the executive branch of the Government
    shall be paid to the Academy through one or more of the following:
    private gifts and bequests; appropriations for the benefit of the
    Academy; grants-in-aid, contracts, and other forms of financial
    agreement with executive departments and agencies. The Academy
    shall receive no compensation whatever for any services to the
    Government of the United States. Further, the Academy shall be
    subject to all provisions of OMB Circular A-122, "Cost Principles
    for Non-Profit Organizations," and to such other requirements
    regarding or limiting the Academy's recovery of costs as the
    Director of the Office of Management and Budget may specify from
    time to time in writing to the Academy and to agencies and
    departments of the Government.
      4. When a department or agency of the executive branch of the
    Government determines that the Academy, because of its unique
    qualifications, is the only source that can provide the measure of
    expertise, independence, objectivity, and audience acceptance
    necessary to meet the department's or agency's program
    requirements, acquisition of services by the Academy may be
    obtained on a noncompetitive basis if otherwise in accordance with
    applicable law and regulations.

      In this section, the text of 36:1306 (1st sentence) is omitted as
    executed and obsolete.
      Before clause (1), the word "objects" is omitted as included in
    "purposes". The word "including" is substituted for "Without
    limiting the generality of the foregoing, the corporation shall
    have the following specific powers" to eliminate unnecessary words.
      In clause (1), the word "adopt" is substituted for "enact", the
    word "regulations" is substituted for "rules, and regulations", and
    the words "for the management of its property and the regulation of
    its affairs" are substituted for "for its internal governance and
    management", for consistency in the revised title. The words "not
    inconsistent with this chapter or other provisions of law" are
    omitted as unnecessary.
      In clause (5), the words "as the activities of the corporation
    require" are substituted for "as may be necessary to carry out the
    corporate purposes" for consistency in the revised title.
      In clause (6), the words "make contracts" are substituted for
    "make and enter into contracts" for consistency in the revised
    title and to eliminate unnecessary words.
      Clause (7) is substituted for 36:1303(d) for consistency in the
    revised title.
      In clause (8), the words "for the purposes of the corporation"
    are omitted as unnecessary. The words "instruments of indebtedness,
    and secure its obligations by granting security interests in its
    property" are substituted for "bonds therefor, and secure the same
    by mortgage" for consistency in the revised title. The words
    "subject in every case to all applicable provisions of Federal and
    State law" are omitted as unnecessary.
      In clause (10), the words "State, regional, local, and overseas"
    are omitted as unnecessary. The words "as needed" are substituted
    for "in such manner and by such rules as it deems appropriate so as
    to enable it", and the words "to carry out the purposes stated in
    section 220102 of this title" are substituted for "to carry out its
    powers and accomplish the objects and purposes set forth in section
    1302 of this title", to eliminate unnecessary words.
      In clause (11), the word "raise" is omitted as included in
    "solicit". The words "for the accomplishment of its purposes" are
    omitted as unnecessary. The words "accept gifts, legacies, devises,
    and support in furtherance thereof" are omitted as unnecessary
    because the same power is granted by the words "solicit funds" (in
    this clause) and "acquire [and] own . . . property" (in clause
    (6)).
      In clause (12), the words "in any court" are omitted as
    unnecessary.
      In clause (13), the words "any other act" are substituted for
    "any and all acts and things" for consistency in the revised title
    and to eliminate unnecessary words. The words "the purposes stated
    in section 220102 of this title" are substituted for "the foregoing
    specifically enumerated purposes" for clarity and consistency in
    the revised section.

    Paralympic Games, or the Pan-American Games, a court shall not
    grant injunctive relief against the corporation within 21 days
    before the beginning of such games if the corporation, after
    consultation with the chair of the Athletes' Advisory Council, has
    provided a sworn statement in writing executed by an officer of the
    corporation to such court that its constitution and bylaws cannot
    provide for the resolution of such dispute prior to the beginning

        federations, the International Olympic Committee, the
        International Paralympic Committee, and the Pan-American Sports
        Organization, and with respect to the resolution of any dispute
        involving the opportunity of an amateur athlete to participate
        in the Olympic Games, the Paralympic Games, the Pan-American

        applicable policies and procedures of the corporation;
          (ii) the termination is initially recommended to the
        corporation's executive committee by either the corporation's
        executive director or by the Athletes' Advisory Council; and
          (iii) the corporation's executive committee fully considers

    Sec. 220521. Recognition of amateur sports organizations as
      national governing bodies

-STATUTE-
      (a) General Authority. - For any sport which is included on the
    program of the Olympic Games, the Paralympic Games, or the Pan-
    American Games, the corporation is authorized to recognize as a
    national governing body (in the case of a sport on the program of
    the Olympic Games or Pan-American Games) or as a paralympic sports
    organization (in the case of a sport on the program of the
    Paralympic Games for which a national governing body has not been
    designated under section 220522(b)) an amateur sports organization
    which files an application and is eligible for such recognition in
    accordance with the provisions of subsection (a) or (b) of section
    220522. The corporation may recognize only one national governing
    body for each sport for which an application is made and approved,
    except as provided in section 220522(b) with respect to a
    paralympic sports organization.
      (b) Public Hearing. - Before recognizing an organization as a
    national governing body, the corporation shall hold at least 2
    public hearings on the application. The corporation shall publish
    notice of the time, place, and nature of the hearings. Publication
    shall be made in a regular issue of the corporation's principal
    publication at least 30 days, but not more than 60 days, before the
    date of the hearings. The corporation shall send written notice,
    which shall include a copy of the application, at least 30 days
    prior to the date of any such public hearing to all amateur sports
    organizations known to the corporation in that sport.
      (c) Recommendation to International Sports Federation. - Within
    61 days after recognizing an organization as a national governing
    body, the corporation shall recommend and support in any
    appropriate manner the national governing body to the appropriate
    international sports federation as the representative of the United
    States for that sport.
      (d) Review of Recognition. - The corporation may review all
    matters related to the continued recognition of an organization as
    a national governing body and may take action it considers
    appropriate, including placing conditions on the continued
    recognition.

    Sec. 220522. Eligibility requirements

-STATUTE-
      (a) General. - An amateur sports organization is eligible to be
    recognized, or to continue to be recognized, as a national
    governing body only if it - 
        (1) is incorporated under the laws of a State of the United
      States or the District of Columbia as a not-for-profit
      corporation having as its purpose the advancement of amateur
      athletic competition;
        (2) has the managerial and financial capability to plan and
      execute its obligations;
        (3) submits - 
          (A) an application, in the form required by the corporation,
        for recognition as a national governing body;
          (B) a copy of its corporate charter and bylaws; and
          (C) any additional information considered necessary or
        appropriate by the corporation;

        (4) agrees to submit to binding arbitration in any controversy
      involving - 
          (A) its recognition as a national governing body, as provided
        for in section 220529 of this title, upon demand of the
        corporation; and
          (B) the opportunity of any amateur athlete, coach, trainer,
        manager, administrator or official to participate in amateur
        athletic competition, upon demand of the corporation or any
        aggrieved amateur athlete, coach, trainer, manager,
        administrator or official, conducted in accordance with the
        Commercial Rules of the American Arbitration Association, as
        modified and provided for in the corporation's constitution and
        bylaws, except that if the Athletes' Advisory Council and
        National Governing Bodies' Council do not concur on any
        modifications to such Rules, and if the corporation's executive
        committee is not able to facilitate such concurrence, the
        Commercial Rules of Arbitration shall apply unless at least two-
        thirds of the corporation's board of directors approves
        modifications to such Rules;

        (5) demonstrates that it is autonomous in the governance of its
      sport, in that it - 
          (A) independently decides and controls all matters central to
        governance;
          (B) does not delegate decision-making and control of matters
        central to governance; and
          (C) is free from outside restraint;

        (6) demonstrates that it is a member of no more than one
      international sports federation that governs a sport included on
      the program of the Olympic Games or the Pan-American Games;
        (7) demonstrates that its membership is open to any individual
      who is an amateur athlete, coach, trainer, manager,
      administrator, or official active in the sport for which
      recognition is sought, or any amateur sports organization that
      conducts programs in the sport for which recognition is sought,
      or both;
        (8) provides an equal opportunity to amateur athletes, coaches,
      trainers, managers, administrators, and officials to participate
      in amateur athletic competition, without discrimination on the
      basis of race, color, religion, sex, age, or national origin, and
      with fair notice and opportunity for a hearing to any amateur
      athlete, coach, trainer, manager, administrator, or official
      before declaring the individual ineligible to participate;
        (9) is governed by a board of directors or other governing
      board whose members are selected without regard to race, color,
      religion, national origin, or sex, except that, in sports where
      there are separate male and female programs, it provides for
      reasonable representation of both males and females on the board
      of directors or other governing board;
        (10) demonstrates, based on guidelines approved by the
      corporation, the Athletes' Advisory Council, and the National
      Governing Bodies' Council, that its board of directors and other
      such governing boards have established criteria and election
      procedures for and maintain among their voting members
      individuals who are actively engaged in amateur athletic
      competition in the sport for which recognition is sought or who
      have represented the United States in international amateur
      athletic competition within the preceding 10 years, that any
      exceptions to such guidelines by such organization have been
      approved by the corporation, and that the voting power held by
      such individuals is not less than 20 percent of the voting power
      held in its board of directors and other such governing boards;
        (11) provides for reasonable direct representation on its board
      of directors or other governing board for any amateur sports
      organization that - 
          (A) conducts a national program or regular national amateur
        athletic competition in the applicable sport on a level of
        proficiency appropriate for the selection of amateur athletes
        to represent the United States in international amateur
        athletic competition; and
          (B) ensures that the representation reflects the nature,
        scope, quality, and strength of the programs and competitions
        of the amateur sports organization in relation to all other
        programs and competitions in the sport in the United States;

        (12) demonstrates that none of its officers are also officers
      of any other amateur sports organization recognized as a national
      governing body;
        (13) provides procedures for the prompt and equitable
      resolution of grievances of its members;
        (14) does not have eligibility criteria related to amateur
      status or to participation in the Olympic Games, the Paralympic
      Games, or the Pan-American Games that are more restrictive than
      those of the appropriate international sports federation; and
        (15) demonstrates, if the organization is seeking to be
      recognized as a national governing body, that it is prepared to
      meet the obligations imposed on a national governing body under
      sections 220524 and 220525 of this title.

      (b) Recognition of Paralympic Sports Organizations. - For any
    sport which is included on the program of the Paralympic Games, the
    corporation is authorized to designate, where feasible and when
    such designation would serve the best interest of the sport, and
    with the approval of the affected national governing body, a
    national governing body recognized under subsection (a) to govern
    such sport. Where such designation is not feasible or would not
    serve the best interest of the sport, the corporation is authorized
    to recognize another amateur sports organization as a paralympic
    sports organization to govern such sport, except that,
    notwithstanding the other requirements of this chapter, any such
    paralympic sports organization - 
        (1) shall comply only with those requirements, perform those
      duties, and have those powers that the corporation, in its sole
      discretion, determines are appropriate to meet the objects and
      purposes of this chapter; and
        (2) may, with the approval of the corporation, govern more than
      one sport included on the program of the Paralympic Games.

    Sec. 220527. Complaints against national governing bodies

-STATUTE-
      (a) General. - (1) An amateur sports organization or person that
    belongs to or is eligible to belong to a national governing body
    may seek to compel the national governing body to comply with
    sections 220522, 220524, and 220525 of this title by filing a
    written complaint with the corporation. A copy of the complaint
    shall be served on the national governing body.
      (2) The corporation shall establish procedures for the filing and
    disposition of complaints under this section.
      (b) Exhaustion of Remedies. - (1) An organization or person may
    file a complaint under subsection (a) of this section only after
    exhausting all available remedies within the national governing
    body for correcting deficiencies, unless it can be shown by clear
    and convincing evidence that those remedies would have resulted in
    unnecessary delay.
      (2) Within 30 days after a complaint is filed, the corporation
    shall decide whether the organization or person has exhausted all
    available remedies as required by paragraph (1) of this subsection.
    If the corporation determines that the remedies have not been
    exhausted, it may direct that the remedies be pursued before the
    corporation considers the complaint further.
      (c) Hearings. - If the corporation decides that all available
    remedies have been exhausted as required by subsection (b)(1) of
    this section, it shall hold a hearing, within 90 days after the
    complaint is filed, to receive testimony to decide whether the
    national governing body is complying with sections 220522, 220524,
    and 220525 of this title.
      (d) Disposition of Complaint. - (1) If the corporation decides,
    as a result of the hearing, that the national governing body is
    complying with sections 220522, 220524, and 220525 of this title,
    it shall so notify the complainant and the national governing body.
      (2) If the corporation decides, as a result of the hearing, that
    the national governing body is not complying with sections 220522,
    220524, and 220525 of this title, it shall - 
        (A) place the national governing body on probation for a
      specified period of time, not to exceed 180 days, which the
      corporation considers necessary to enable the national governing
      body to comply with those sections; or
        (B) revoke the recognition of the national governing body.

      (3) If the corporation places a national governing body on
    probation under paragraph (2) of this subsection, it may extend the
    probationary period if the national governing body has proven by
    clear and convincing evidence that, through no fault of its own, it
    needs additional time to comply with sections 220522, 220524, and
    220525 of this title. If, at the end of the period allowed by the
    corporation, the national governing body has not complied with
    those sections, the corporation shall revoke the recognition of the
    national governing body.

    Sec. 220528. Applications to replace an incumbent national
      governing body

-STATUTE-
      (a) General. - An amateur sports organization may seek to replace
    an incumbent as the national governing body for a particular sport
    by filing a written application for recognition with the
    corporation.
      (b) Establishment of Procedures. - The corporation shall
    establish procedures for the filing and disposition of applications
    under this section. If 2 or more organizations file applications
    for the same sport, the applications shall be considered in a
    single proceeding.
      (c) Filing Procedures. - (1) An application under this section
    must be filed within one year after the final day of - 
        (A) any Olympic Games, for a sport in which competition is held
      in the Olympic Games or the Paralympic Games, or in both the
      Olympic and Pan-American Games; or
        (B) any Pan-American Games, for a sport in which competition is
      held in the Pan-American Games but not in the Olympic Games.

      (2) The application shall be filed with the corporation by
    certified mail, and a copy of the application shall be served on
    the national governing body and with any other organization that
    has filed an application. The corporation shall inform the
    applicant that its application has been received.
      (d) Hearings. - Within 180 days after receipt of an application
    filed under this section, the corporation shall conduct a formal
    hearing open to the public to determine the merits of the
    application. The corporation shall publish notice of the time and
    place of the hearing in a regular issue of its principal
    publication at least 30 days, but not more than 60 days, before the
    date of the hearing. The corporation also shall send written
    notice, including a copy of the application, at least 30 days prior
    to the date of the hearing to all amateur sports organizations
    known to the corporation in that sport. In the hearing, the
    applicant and the national governing body shall be given a
    reasonable opportunity to present evidence supporting their
    positions.
      (e) Standards for Granting Applications. - In the hearing, the
    applicant must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that - 
        (1) it meets the criteria for recognition as a national
      governing body under section 220522 of this title; and
        (2)(A) the national governing body does not meet the criteria
      of section 220522, 220524, or 220525 of this title; or
        (B) the applicant more adequately meets the criteria of section
      220522 of this title, is capable of more adequately meeting the
      criteria of sections 220524 and 220525 of this title, and
      provides or is capable of providing a more effective national
      program of competition than the national governing body in the
      sport for which it seeks recognition.

      (f) Disposition of Applications. - Within 30 days after the close
    of the hearing required by this section, the corporation shall - 
        (1) uphold the right of the national governing body to continue
      as the national governing body for its sport;
        (2) revoke the recognition of the national governing body and
      declare a vacancy in the national governing body for that sport;
        (3) revoke the recognition of the national governing body and
      recognize the applicant as the national governing body; or
        (4) place the national governing body on probation for a period
      not exceeding 180 days, pending the compliance of the national
      governing body, if the national governing body would have
      retained recognition except for a minor deficiency in one of the
      requirements of section 220522, 220524, or 220525 of this title
      and notify such national governing body of such probation and of
      the actions needed to comply with such requirements.

      (g) Revocation of Recognition After Probation. - If the national
    governing body does not comply with sections 220522, 220524, and
    220525 of this title within the probationary period prescribed
    under subsection (f)(4) of this section, the corporation shall
    revoke the recognition of the national governing body and either - 
        (1) recognize the applicant as the national governing body; or
        (2) declare a vacancy in the national governing body for that
      sport.

-STATUTE-
      The purposes of the corporation are patriotic, fraternal,
    historical, and educational, in the service and for the benefit of
    veterans of World War I, and are - 
        (1) to provide for the veterans of World War I an organization
      for their mutual benefit, pleasure, and amusement which will
      afford them opportunities and means for personal contact with
      each other to keep alive friendships and memories of World War I
      and to venerate the memory of their honored dead;
        (2) to cooperate to the fullest extent and in a harmonious
      manner with all veterans' organizations so that the best
      interests of all veterans of all wars in which the United States
      has participated, and the widows and orphans of deceased veterans
      of those wars, may best be served;
        (3) to stimulate communities and political subdivisions into
      taking more interest in veterans of World War I, the widows and
      orphans of those deceased veterans, and the problems of those
      veterans and their widows and orphans;
        (4) to collate, preserve, and encourage the study of historical
      episodes, chronicles, mementos, and events pertaining to World
      War I;
        (5) to fight vigorously to uphold the Constitution and laws of
      the United States as well as the individual States of the Union
      and to foster the spirit and practice of true Americanism;
        (6) to fight unceasingly for our national security to protect
      Americans from enemies within our borders, as well as those from
      without, so that our American way of life is preserved;
        (7) to fight to the utmost all those alien forces, particularly
      forces such as communism, whose objectives are to deny our very
      existence as a free people; and
        (8) to do any other act necessary and proper to carry out the
      purposes of the corporation.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 300104. Board of governors

-STATUTE-
      (a) Board of Governors. - (1) The board of governors is the
    governing body of the corporation with all powers of governing and
    managing the corporation. The board has 50 members. The governors
    shall be appointed or elected in the following manner:
        (A) The President shall appoint eight governors, one of whom
      the President shall designate to act as the principal officer of
      the corporation with the title and functions provided in the
      bylaws. The other governors appointed by the President shall be
      officials of departments and agencies of the United States
      Government, whose positions and interests qualify them to
      contribute to carrying out the programs and purposes of the
      corporation. At least one, but not more than three, of those
      officials shall be selected from the Armed Forces.
        (B) The chapters shall elect 30 governors at the national
      convention under procedures for nomination and election that
      ensure equitable representation of all chapters, with regard to
      geographical considerations, the size of the chapters, and the
      size of the populations served by the chapters.
        (C) The board shall elect 12 governors as members-at-large.
      Those governors shall be individuals who are representative of
      the national interests that the corporation serves, and with
      which it is desirable that the corporation have close
      association.

      (2) One-third of the members elected to the board shall be
    elected at each national convention, and take office at that time
    or as soon as practicable after the convention.
      (b) Term of Office and Vacancies. - (1) The term of office of
    each governor is 3 years. However, the term of office of a governor
    appointed by the President (except the principal officer of the
    corporation) expires if, before the end of the 3-year term, the
    governor retires from the official position held at the time of
    appointment as a governor.
      (2) The President shall fill as soon as practicable a vacancy in
    the office of the principal officer of the corporation or in the
    position of another governor appointed by the President. The board
    shall make a temporary appointment to fill a vacancy occurring in
    an elected position on the board. An individual appointed by the
    board to fill a vacancy serves until the next national convention.
      (c) Executive Committee. - The board may - 
        (1) appoint, from its own members, an executive committee of at
      least 11 individuals to exercise the powers of the board when the
      board is not in session; and
        (2) appoint and remove, or provide for the appointment and
      removal of, officers and employees of the corporation, except the
      principal officer of the corporation.

      (d) Voting by Proxy. - Voting by proxy is not allowed at any
    meeting of the board, at the national convention, or at any meeting
    of a chapter. However, the board may allow the election of
    governors by proxy at the national convention if the board believes
    a national emergency makes attendance at the national convention
    impossible.

      Chapter or the American National Red Cross in any building or
      improvement constructed on such property shall be first made
      available for use by Federal agencies at rental rates and other
      related expenses that are less than fair market value and reflect
      the value of the property provided to such Red Cross Chapter
      under the provisions of this Act;
        "(5) the United States shall cooperate with such Red Cross
      Chapter with respect to any zoning or other matters relating to
      the development or improvement of such property; and
