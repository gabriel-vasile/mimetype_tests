<b>Technical Description:</b><P>
This project involves a study of the complex relationships between thin film deposition,
microstructural features and electro-optical properties of barium titanate thin films deposited by
by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD).  Novel electro-optical measurement
methodology is under development to determine the crystallographic orientation and polarization
state of the thin films.<p>
<b>Technical Objective:</b><P>
The objectives are to address key scientific issues vital to the advancement of ferroelectric oxide-
based thin film photonic devices for information technology and communications industries and
to develop appropriate measurement methodology as needed to study these issues.<p>
<b>Outcome:</b><P>
The outcome will be the establishment of microstructural characterization and electro-optical
measurement techniques needed to develop the processing/structure/property relationships of
importance for ferroelectric oxide thin films for photonic devices.<p>
<b>Accomplishments:</b><P>
A thermal MOCVD system, designed and built at NIST for ferroelectric oxide film deposition,
has been modified to include an oxygen preheater and metalorganic bubblers with improved
temperature control.  These modifications have improved the reproducibility of the deposition
experiments.  A set of processing conditions has been established for the deposition of epitaxial
BaTiO<sub>3</sub> films on single crystal MgO and KTaO<sub>3</sub> substrates in the modified system.<p>
X-ray diffraction studies showed that the BaTiO<sub>3</sub> films could contain either epitaxial,
polycrystalline or amorphous material, or a combination of epitaxial and amorphous or
polycrystalline and amorphous phases.  Second harmonic generation (SHG) in the films was
measured as a function of the incidence angle of the fundamental beam as well as the direction
of polarization of the fundamental beam.  The SHG data on the as-grown films were not relatable
to either the microstructure or the crystallographic orientation of the BaTiO<sub>3</sub> grains.  Thus, SHG
was shown not to be a viable technique for determining the orientation of BaTiO<sub>3</sub> thin films,
despite contrary reports in the literature.<p>
