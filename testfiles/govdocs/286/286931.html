SERIES  NOTE


Current Bibliographies in Medicine (CBM) is a continuation in part of
the National Library of Medicine's Literature Search Series, which
ceased in 1987 with No. 87-15.  In 1989 it also subsumed the
Specialized Bibliography Series.  Each bibliography in the new series
covers a distinct subject area of biomedicine and is intended to fulfill a
current awareness function.  Citations are usually derived from
searching a variety of online databases.  NLM databases utilized include
MEDLINE, AVLINE, BIOETHICSLINE, CANCERLIT, CATLINE,
HEALTH, POPLINE, and TOXLINE.  The only criterion for the
inclusion of a particular published work is its relevance to the topic
being presented; the format, ownership, or location of the material is
not considered.

Comments and suggestions on this series may be addressed to:

DISEASE PREVENTION RESEARCH AT NIH


Americans today are taking a more active role in their health care than
ever before.  They realize the influence that they can have on their own
health and the overall health status of the country.  They are more
aware that advances in biomedical care alone will not eliminate the
devastating impact of chronic disease, and that health promotion and
disease prevention comprise perhaps our best opportunity to reduce the
ever-increasing portion of our resources that are spent on treating
preventable illness.

This bibliography was prepared in support of the conference titled
"Disease Prevention Research at NIH: An Agenda for All" held in
Bethesda, MD on October 6-8, 1993.  The purpose of the conference is
to chart a course for future prevention research activities at the
National Institutes of Health (NIH) and to foster intra-agency
collaboration.  The conference is supported by the NIH Institutes,
Centers, and Divisions as well as by the Office of the Director, NIH and
was planned by both governmental and non-governmental
organizations.  Prevention related interventions often have implications
that cut across organ systems, disease entities, population groups, and
Congressional and Institute mandates.

The purpose of the bibliography is to present a selection of citations to
publications in the disease prevention areas addressed by the
conference speakers.  The arrangement of the publications in the
bibliography parallels the organization of the conference.  The first two
sections contain citations to general prevention research and the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services initiative "Healthy People
2000."  The sections corresponding to several plenary sessions are
age-related: Maternal and Child Health, Adolescent and Young Adults,
Adults, and Older Adults.  Topics included here are vaccines, cancer
chemoprevention, cardiovascular and periodontal disease prevention,
prevention of violent behavior and substance abuse, and the prevention
of AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases.  A final section of the
bibliography includes publications relating to workshop topics, such as
physical health and activity, obesity, and diet and nutrition.

Journal articles are the primary type of publication covered, although
citations to some books, book chapters, government publications,
conference papers, and meeting abstracts have been included.  Letters
to the editor, short communications, and dissertations were generally
excluded.  The majority of the publications selected were produced by
investigators supported by intramural or extramural Public Health
Service (PHS) funds or discuss PHS prevention activities or goals. 
Some categories may also contain selected non-PHS review articles. 
All citations are to English language publications.  Some citations may
appear in more than one category.

The compilers wish to thank the following people who either reviewed
or contributed citations for the final bibliography: Jan Howard, Ph.D.,
Chief, Prevention Research Branch, National Institute on Alcohol
Abuse and Alcoholism; Emily Chew, M.D., Medical Officer, Division
of Biometry and Epidemiology, National Eye Institute; Peter F. Kador,
M.D., Chief, Laboratory of Mechanisms of Ocular Disease, National
Eye Institute; Carmen Moten, Office of Science Policy and Legislation,
National Eye Institute; Reva Lawrence, Office of the Director, National
Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases; and Susan
Van Lenten and Lisa Bundara-Freeland, Office of Science Policy and
Analysis, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.   
  


SEARCH  STRATEGY


A variety of online databases are usually searched in preparing
bibliographies in the CBM series.  To assist you in updating or
otherwise manipulating the material in this search, the strategy used for
the NLM's MEDLINE database is given below.  Please note that the
search strategies presented here differ from individual demand searches
in that they are generally broadly formulated and irrelevant citations
edited out prior to printing.

The following strategy may be used with additional specific MeSH
terms (subheadings such as ET and EP may also be used to broaden the
scope of prevention research): 


SS 1 = EXP ACCIDENT PREVENTION OR 
       EXP PREVENTIVE MEDICINE OR 
       EXP PREVENTIVE DENTISTRY OR
       EXP ORTHODONTICS, PREVENTIVE

SS 2 = EXP PREVENTIVE PSYCHIATRY OR 
       EXP PRIMARY PREVENTION OR 
       EXP PREVENTIVE HEALTH SERVICES

SS 3 = HEALTH PROMOTION OR EXP MASS SCREENING

SS 4 = PC (SH)

SS 5 = 1 OR 2 OR 3 OR 4

SS 6 = 5 AND SUP PHS

SS 7 = 5 AND EXP UNITED STATES PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE

SS 8 = 6 OR 7


It is also possible to search the ID field in MEDLINE from 1990 to
date with a two-character grant acronym (ie., AG for National Institute
on Aging) for studies funded by specific institutes. See the NLM
Technical Bulletin 1992 Sep-Oct;(268):17-8 for a listing of institutes'
two-character grant acronyms. 



GRATEFUL MED


To make online searching easier and more efficient, the Library offers
GRATEFUL MED, microcomputer-based software that provides a
user-friendly interface to most NLM databases.  This software was
specifically developed for health professionals and features multiple
choice menus and "fill in the blank" screens for easy search preparation. 
GRATEFUL MED runs on an IBM PC (or IBM-compatible) with
DOS 2.0 or a Macintosh, and requires a Hayes (or Hayes-compatible)
modem.  It may be purchased from the National Technical Information
Service in Springfield, Virginia, for $29.95 (plus $3.00 per order for
shipping).  For your convenience, an order blank has been enclosed at
the back of this bibliography.



SAMPLE  CITATIONS


Citations in this bibliographic series are formatted according to the
rules established for Index Medicus*.  Sample journal and monograph
citations appear below.  For journal articles written in a foreign
language, the English translation of the title is placed in brackets; for
monographs, the title is given in the original language.  In both cases
the language of publication is shown by a three letter abbreviation
appearing at the end of the citation.  Note also that a colon (:) may
appear within an author's name or article title.  The NLM computer
system automatically inserts this symbol in the place of a diacritical
mark.
