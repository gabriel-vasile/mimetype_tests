annual celebration of the nation's birth takes place at Cowpens
National Battlefield, a National Park Service area, site of the
1781 Revolutionary War battle which played a crucial role in the
creation of our nation. The decisive Patriot victory at Cowpens
during the Southern Campaign was the "great encourager"
which inspired the patriots to continue the war to victory at
Yorktown, and it is considered by some military historians to be
the most brilliantly orchestrated and fought single battle of the
American Revolution. Deriving its name from the "cow
pasture" of the colonial farmers who brought their cattle to
form herds to drive to market, Cowpens was the site of the defeat
of the left wing of Cornwallis' army by Gen. Daniel
Morgan's Patriot army on January 17, 1781. On this day, on this
battlefield, the British lost nearly 85% of their forces committed
to action. So great was the joy of the Continental Congress when
they heard of this complete rout of British Col. Banastre
Tarleton's forces, they issued three good medals to
participants in the battle. Only twelve such medals were issued
during the entire eight years of the American Revolutionary
War.

      <p style="text-align: left">Costumed interpreters in period
clothing and replicas of colonial-era tents and equipment re-create
an atmosphere of colonial life with its sights and smells.
Cannoneers, also in colonial dress, demonstrate the various loading
procedures necessary to prepare the three-pounder
"grasshopper" cannon for firing. When fired, the boom of
the cannon and the vibration of the earth, along with the flames
and smoke, smell and taste of gun powder, give visitors a small
sampling of what battle in the 18th century was like. The day's
celebration includes colonial-era music, and costumed actors who
present other characters of significance in Revolutionary War
history, including Lord Cornwallis and Thomas Paine. Contemporary
music, including rock n' roll and jazz, is also performed. To
end the day's festivities, it has become a tradition for the
South Carolina 246th Army National Guard Band to play
Tchaikovsky's 
        <i>1812 Overture;</i> its musical climax is
accompanied by a brilliant fireworks display.
