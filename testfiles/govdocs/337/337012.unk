_______________________________________________________________________

2151. CHILD STATUS PROTECTION ACT BENEFICIARIES

Priority: Substantive, Nonsignificant. Major status under 5 USC 801 is 
undetermined.

Legal Authority: 8 USC 1104

CFR Citation: Not Yet Determined

Legal Deadline: None

Abstract: The rule implements the Child Status Protection Act of 2002. 
The Act helps protect certain immigrant visa applicants from being 
denied immigration benefits due to their reaching the age of 21 and 
because of delays in legacy INS petition approval and adjustment 
processing. If an alien is eligible for relief after reaching age 21, 
his/her age is frozen throughout the pendency of his/her case. The rule 
sets forth the special formulas for calculating an alien's age for 
immigrant visa processing purposes.

Abstract: The rule announces the Department's intention to fingerprint 
certain immigrant and nonimmigrant visa applicants. Pursuant to section 
303 of the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act, the

resistant visas and travel and entry documents that use biometric 
identifiers. Fingerprints will be taken for the purpose of establishing 
a pilot program for meeting the biometric requirement. 22 CFR 41.105 
authorizes consular officers to fingerprint visa applicants if the 
officer considers that necessary for the purposes of investigation or 
identification.

collected from within the application fee and will not increase the 
overall current cost of the passport.
