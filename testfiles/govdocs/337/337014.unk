Abstract: This interim rule implements the requirements to the Passport 
Services Enhancement Act of 2005, amending the Passport Act of June 4,

surcharge to cover costs of meeting the increased demand for passports 
as a result of actions taken to comply with section 7209(b) the

Passport Services Enhancement Act authorizes the Department of State to 
assess a surcharge on applicable fees for the filing of each passport 
application to offset its additional costs. The surcharge will be 
collected from within the application fee and will not increase the 
overall current cost of the passport.

1880. [bull] PASSPORT PROCEDURES--AMENDMENT TO RESTRICTION OF PASSPORT 
REGULATIONS

Priority: Substantive, Nonsignificant

Legal Authority: 42 USC 652, sec 452(k) ``Social Security Act''; PL 
109-171, sec 7303 ``Deficit Reduction Act of 2005''

CFR Citation: 22 CFR 51.70(a)(8)

Legal Deadline: None

Abstract: This regulation resets the limit of child support arrears at 
which a passport can be denied from $5,000 to $2,500, while leaving the 
rest of the regulations and current programs in place. This is at the 
behest of the Department of Health and Human Services. It is a small 
change in an existing regulation, which denies passports to child 
support obligors, and implications outside the specific scope of this 
regulatory change should be minimal.
