<P>When people think about quilts, they often picture women sitting together around a quilt frame,
enjoying a communal experience.  Quilts are frequently used, both literally and metaphorically, to
express a sense of community.  However, there is another common thread that runs throughout the
history of American quilts -- that of competition.

<P>During the nineteenth century, state and local agricultural fairs regularly included competitive
categories for quilts and other needlework.  There was a strong feeling that displaying and
awarding prizes to the most beautifully designed and well-constructed quilts would encourage
women to improve their skills.  In the twentieth century, the wide circulation of women's
magazines invited entries in national quilt competitions.  The most notable of these was the Century
of Progress Quilt Contest sponsored by Sears, Roebuck and Company as part of the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/pan:@field(NUMBER+@band(pan+6a27920))">1933 World's
Fair in Chicago</A>.  The first prize of $1,200 must have been a powerful incentive during the lean
years of the Great Depression, as the contest attracted nearly twenty-five thousand entries from all
over the country.

<P>In 1992, the Coming Home Division of Lands' End Direct Merchants teamed up with <I>Good
Housekeeping</I> magazine to sponsor an "All-American Quilt Contest."  From the entries received,
judges selected both a first prize winner from each state and a national winner.  The contest was
repeated in 1994 and 1996, under the theme "If Quilts Could Talk."  The 1994 winners were
invited to submit short essays about their quilts, and in 1996, all entrants were invited to do the
same.  Many quiltmakers took the opportunity to share the stories of their quilts, and while a
collection of prize-winners may not represent the full range of American quilts, their stories,
motivations, and meanings connect them with hundreds of thousands of other quilts that decorate
beds, comfort children, document weddings and birthdays, and give pleasure to the makers and
their loved ones.

<P>The makers of the winning quilts from all three years of the contest were asked to submit additional
information about their quilts to share with viewers of this online collection.  It is clear from these
responses and the original essays, that the process of making and sharing a quilt can achieve many
purposes, reflect many and complex meanings and relationships, and warm and comfort the spirit
as well as the body.

<P>One might suppose that the winners of national quilt contests would all be experienced, even
professional, quilt artists, and indeed, the state winners include a number of people who earn
income from quilt-related enterprises.  However, a surprising number of winners had been quilting
only a short time when they entered the contest.  Some had done other kinds of sewing and
needlework, and they found quiltmaking a natural extension of their skills. 

<P>In an age of quilt classes, instruction books, and videos, one might assume that there are few
opportunities for learning to make quilts "the old-fashioned way," from members of the family. 
Surprisingly, however, a number of winning quilters responded that they had indeed learned from
mothers, grandmothers, or friends.  Others learned from church groups making quilts for charity.  
The majority described themselves as "self-taught," and in a very real sense, this could describe
every quilter.  Whether one is watching a video, reading from a book, or listening to words of
instruction, the learning process is similar:  each quilter must consciously learn to perform the
necessary motions and then practice until the actions become familiar.

<P>There are ongoing debates among quilters about whether quilts should be considered "art" or
"craft."  A quilt, like any other individually made object, represents both aesthetic and technical
considerations.  Some quilts are intentionally created to serve as bedcovers, while others are
designed to be hung on walls.   To function well as a bedcover, a quilt must be made in an
appropriate size, shape, and proportion; its weight and thickness should provide the necessary
warmth; and it should not be embellished with sharp objects that might threaten injury.  A quilt for
a wall has different requirements.   Its visual interest is paramount, and it must hang straight. 
Since walls come in all sizes, there is more variety in the size and shape of wall quilts.  These
categories are not entirely separate, of course, as many quilts can serve either function.

<P>Even casual observers of quilts are aware that specific quilt patterns have names.  "Wild Goose
Chase," "Drunkard's Path," and "Log Cabin" are recognized by quilters and non-quilters alike, and
these traditional patterns frequently inspire original variations.   Many quiltmakers, however,
bestow specific <I>titles</I> on their special quilts, whether the quilts use traditional patterns or represent
original designs.  These titles often reflect the maker's inspiration or indicate the quilt's intended
purpose.

<P>The quiltmakers of the late twentieth century have a bewildering abundance of fabrics from which
to choose.  Many purists insist upon 100 percent cotton material; others look for particular colors,
textures, or patterns while ignoring the fiber content.  Although quiltmakers of this era typically
buy new fabric especially for their quilts, a number of state winners indicated that they had
challenged themselves to use only those fabrics already in their collections.  Experienced
quiltmakers often admit to accumulating large fabric collections to provide an extensive "palette"
from which to choose.

<P>The 1994 and 1996 contest theme, "If Quilts Could Talk," inspired some entrants to make quilts
specifically for the contest.  Others realized that quilts they were already working on, or had
recently finished, fit the theme.   However, as a number of entrants pointed out, "every quilt has a
story to tell," suggesting that the theme was not considered a limitation.  The narratives about the
winning quilts display a remarkable range of motivations and influences.  Some depict very
personal stories, such as recovery from illness or the loss of a loved one.  Others make political
statements about local, national, or international events and concerns.  In particular, the 1992
contest attracted a large number of quilts made in response to the Persian Gulf War.

<P>Quilts frequently celebrate birthdays, graduations, weddings, anniversaries, and retirements, and a
number of the winning entries commemorate such events.  These quilts include visual reminders of
the intended recipients' lives and interests such as pictorial images, actual items of clothing, or
symbols of personal significance.  With some quilts, the story is  easily "read" by the viewer. 
With others, the meaning may not be apparent without the accompanying narrative.  Without
knowing the story, all we see is a pretty quilt.

<P>Nature, in its many manifestations, proves a frequent inspiration to quilters.  Some express their
connection to the natural world by choosing or adapting traditional floral quilt patterns, while
others describe the attempt to "paint" with fabric.  For some, nature is as near as the backyard or a
favorite walking trail; others are moved to interpret a vista from a vacation or a childhood memory. 
Contest winners described the challenges of recreating in fabric the emotional qualities evoked by
the beauty and power of natural landscapes.

<P>Many quilters find that fabric is an effective medium through which to explore and express the
spiritual dimensions of their lives.  The process of creating a quilt is, for many, a rich and
profound experience.   Some quilters feel a deep sense of union with their own ancestors, with
generations of past quiltmakers, or with the creation of the universe.

<P>While quilters have many tools and techniques to choose from to facilitate the process, the truth is
that making a quilt, particularly a prize-winning quilt, takes time and personal commitment.   No
matter what the impetus for making a particular quilt, nearly all of the contest winners reported that
the challenge of designing, constructing, and completing their quilts rewarded them with a strong
sense of achievement.

<P>When the winners were asked their primary reason for entering the contest, many responded that
friends and relatives had urged them to do so.  Others saw this as an appropriate way to share a
suitable quilt and its story.  The state winners reported a wide range of experience in entering quilt
competitions.  A large number regularly enter -- and win prizes -- in national and regional contests. 
Some quilters indicated that they enter a few shows every year.  Yet, a surprising number of the
winners revealed that they had rarely or never entered a quilt contest before.  For many of these,
the contest theme and the urging of friends were important factors in their decision to enter this
contest. 

<P>Quilters who regularly show their quilts through contests, shows, and magazines found that being
a winner in this particular contest did not change their lives or the way they look at their work as
quiltmakers.  Others, however, reported that being a winner meant that their families, friends, and
communities took their work more seriously and that being recognized as "experts" has boosted
their self-esteem and allowed them to see themselves as artists.  Another group responded that they
continue to make quilts because they enjoy the process.  The recognition is nice, they say, but less
important than the feeling of personal satisfaction.

<P>Although this group of prize-winning quilts does not represent a true cross-section of the work of
American quiltmakers, the quiltmakers' responses indicate the wide range of experiences that
influence how the quilts are envisioned and brought to reality.  Each quilt is the result of a unique
process of inspiration and construction, and each has a story to tell.
