      <P><span class="body">Bonnie [Cameron] and Marianne Seale shown on screen 
        </span></P>
      </I> 
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: Hi, my name is Bonnie and I&#146;d like to 
        welcome you to our live NASA-Quest Web cast here at NASA/Ames in California. 
        I&#146;m a member of the Young Women of NASA Advisory Council, an online 
        mentoring project. Women of NASA is one of NASA-Quest&#146;s outreach 
        programs. Our virtual <I>Take Our</I> <I>Daughters To Work</I> day is 
        a day-long series of online interactive events focusing on NASA&#146;s 
        space research that benefits life on Earth.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Today, we&#146;re happy to have two very important 
        guests with us. First we&#146;ll go live to Susan Helms aboard the International 
        Space Station. I&#146;ll be able to talk with her for about 20 minutes, 
        which is lucky because on the ISS every second is scheduled for the astronauts.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">The questions I&#146;ve prepared come straight from 
        our forum where viewers like you at home and school, were able to write 
        in their questions. Then once we&#146;ve heard from Susan on the ISS, 
        we&#146;ll get a chance to hear from our ISS research expert, Marianne 
        Seale. She&#146;ll tell us about her work with NASA and fill us in on 
        some of the science experiments that go on up in space with Susan Helms.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne, it&#146;s very nice to have you with us. 
        We&#146;re so glad you could join us today.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: It is delightful to be here.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: Well thank you. And now we&#146;ll go to Houston, 
        Texas, where thousands of men and women at Johnson Space Center are helping 
        manage the ISS from down below on Earth.</span></P>
      <I>
      <P><span class="body">Pictures of path tracking map from Johnson Space Center 
        shown on screen.</span></P>
      </I> 
      <P><span class="body">What you see here is the path that tracks the actual 
        location of the ISS. If you can spot the red circle on your lower left 
        corner, it shows you that the ISS is orbiting above Earth in that specific 
        area. </span></P>
      <I>
      <P><span class="body">Live shot of Mission Control at Johnson Space Center</span></P>
      </I> 
      <P><span class="body">Now a little behind-the-scenes action. On the far-right 
        is the flight director. On the left is CatCom. It is CatCom&#146;s job 
        to handle all communications with the astronauts while on the ISS. The 
        CatCom position is always held by an astronaut, in this case, Stephanie 
        Wilson.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">This big room is called Mission Control. The name 
        speaks for itself, because in here, each person is in charge of a different 
        part of the ISS. They handle everything in here, including connecting 
        me to Susan Helms through the phone line and special satellite. The man 
        in the blue shirt, on the right, is the flight director.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">F: Alpha this is Houston, thank you so much for your 
        patience. Are you ready for the event?</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Susan: Alpha is ready. </span></P>
      <I>
      <P><span class="body">Live shot of Susan Helms speaking from onboard ISS.</span></P>
      </I> 
      <P><span class="body">F: Bonnie [Cameron] for voice check. Please call Alpha 
        for voice check.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: Alpha this is Bonnie [Cameron] how do you 
        hear me?</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Susan: We have you loud and a little bit unclear, 
        Bonnie. How do you hear me?</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: I hear you clearly.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Susan: Okay.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: Susan, this is Bonnie from the Young Women 
        of NASA Advisory Council. Thank you so much for talking to us today here 
        at NASA/Ames for our virtual take our daughters to work day. These questions 
        </span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Susan: Sorry Bonnie, you had some feedback there. 
        </span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: Yes, we&#146;re trying to eliminate that. 
        </span></P>
      <P><span class="body">At this point we&#146;re experiencing some feedback 
        from the microphones in all the equipment. Obviously when you&#146;re 
        talking to someone in outer space, there can be a few technology glitches. 
        But while we were fixing it, Susan took advantage of the microgravity 
        in space. </span></P>
      <P><span class="body">You can see her here putting down her microphone and 
        practicing her gymnastics. </span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: All right ... how do you read me?</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Susan: Read you with an echo and some garbled feedback.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: This is Bonnie, how do you read me?</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Susan: Okay, got you loud and clear there.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: All right, great. Thank you, Susan. Again 
        these questions have been gathered from young people across the nation. 
        So we&#146;ll start with, can you please tell us a little bit about where 
        you are right now on the space station?</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Susan: Right now I&#146;m in the U.S. built laboratory 
        called Destiny. The space station out there has about four major modules 
        right now, the Destiny module being one of them. Just behind me in the 
        next module is the [node] Unity. Beyond that is the [FGB] which is [Velya], 
        and then the very last module on the end is [Gazelle] which is Russian 
        built as well as the FGB, The [Zelya] module.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">So we have basically this big long string of modules 
        which stretch out from right where I am basically all the way down there 
        by many, many meters. </span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: Thank you, Susan. Now we&#146;d like to know 
        a little bit about what it&#146;s like to be living in space. What&#146;s 
        a normal day like for you? Do you have a specific schedule or specific 
        tasks?</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Susan: I don&#146;t think NASA would get their money&#146;s 
        worth out of us unless we were put on some kind of schedule. Basically 
        what we do is wake up about 6:00 in the morning, every morning and work 
        all the way up until about 10:00 o&#146;clock at night. We have some breaks 
        for lunch, breakfast and dinner, and we do have some time available in 
        the morning and in the evening to either get done with sleep or get ready 
        for sleep. But basically all day long we&#146;ve been given work to do 
        and we have a [inaudible] array of [inaudible] the information on how 
        to do that work. And so we spend most of our days getting work accomplished 
        that NASA and also the Russian Space Agency have determined to be the 
        most important priority for the day.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: Susan, it sounds like you have a lot of several 
        important responsibilities while in space. But do you have any leisure 
        time for any type of fun things on the ISS?</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Susan: Well unfortunately our leisure time is really 
        not all that much. They try hard to give us a little bit, and when that 
        happens, I often write personal e-mail to my family at home, as well as 
        my friends. In addition, I try to practice my space gymnastics. I really 
        love being up here in zero G and having the opportunity to do all kinds 
        of neat things you can&#146;t do on the Earth. And of course one thing 
        we all do all the time is look out the window, because the Earth is just 
        so incredibly beautiful. It&#146;s difficult to believe we&#146;re even 
        here to see it this way, and we want to watch it over and over. There 
        is no getting tired of looking at the Earth from afar.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: So it sounds like zero gravity has definitely 
        changed your lifestyle. Can you share some other specific examples from 
        daily life that have changed? For example, sleeping, eating, clothing, 
        family, gravity or privacy?</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Susan: Well I would say that the things that have 
        changed the most are things that need water. And by that I mean sleeping&#146;s 
        okay, you don&#146;t need water to go to sleep, and sleeping up here is 
        about the same as sleeping on Earth. But when it comes time to taking 
        a shower, there&#146;s a major difference between life on Earth and life 
        in space.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">We basically can&#146;t really do that. We have to 
        take what we call sponge baths with just wet towels because we don&#146;t 
        have a way of taking a hot shower. Likewise with our food, there is no 
        ability to cook anything from scratch because we don&#146;t have the ability 
        to get to water to prepare it. But we do have the ability to use a water 
        dispenser to put water into pre-packaged food. And so that ends up sort 
        of limiting the different kinds of food we can eat on orbit.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">We have to stick to the things that can be prepared 
        with water or with our small oven, and we aren&#146;t really in a position 
        to get fresh vegetables and fruits from the store every week. So we don&#146;t 
        see a whole lot of those.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Likewise, I think if you think about what a toilet 
        would be like without using water, you could probably get some kind of 
        idea about how different that is than a standard toilet on Earth. But 
        that&#146;s definitely you can get used to quickly, and it&#146;s not 
        been a problem. It&#146;s just a different way of doing that type of thing.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: Well we&#146;re glad to hear it hasn&#146;t 
        been too much of a problem for you. Now, we&#146;d like to ask you a little 
        bit more about your life before your NASA career. What were your favorite 
        activities and classes growing up and was there a special role model or 
        mentor that you remember?</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Susan: Well I think I have to admit my favorite activity 
        growing up was math and science. Anything having to do with math or science 
        in general was the type of thing I was interested in. I wasn&#146;t really 
        a good student of history. I did have some role models when I was growing 
        up. I had, believe it or not, mostly female science and math teachers 
        and they were always people I looked up to. And of course by having teachers 
        that were female in those topics, there was no reason why I couldn&#146;t 
        continue to study science as a career. I didn&#146;t see that there was 
        anything strange about doing that.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">I also had, in fact let me mention one teacher in 
        particular, [Orry Pauli], she was one of our junior high science teachers 
        and she was extremely motivational and I really enjoyed learning science 
        from her and I think there was something about that that stuck with me 
        for a long time. </span></P>
      <P><span class="body">I also want to mention I had a great guidance counselor, 
        [Deb Pratt] and she worked very hard to make sure that I was motivated 
        in the right direction. And I also was surrounded by great friends who 
        were very supportive about studying math and science and doing well at 
        it. I just hung out with the right people, I guess.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: Well it sounds like you had a lot of good 
        support in your scientific development, I guess. It sounds like teachers 
        and counselors were especially important. It&#146;s good to remember that 
        all adults have an important role in our life.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Now how do you feel about being</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Susan: That&#146;s right.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: I&#146;m sorry. How do you feel about being 
        a female astronaut? What about being a woman makes you especially good 
        at this particular job?</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Susan: Well I like to look at it from the standpoint 
        of just being an astronaut who is able to do the work. I don&#146;t think 
        a whole lot about whether or not being female makes a difference on that. 
        And that&#146;s probably a good thing, because the less that you pay attention 
        to differences, the more those differences seem to really matter. So my 
        philosophy is to not pay attention to gender differences, but to really 
        focus on whether or not the work gets done, and whether it gets done the 
        right way.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">In any case, if there is some aspects of being female 
        that are helpful, I don&#146;t know. I hate to stereotype women, but I 
        will say that two qualities up here that are very helpful are patience 
        and an open mind. And if you have those two qualities, whether you&#146;re 
        a male or female, you&#146;ll do well as an astronaut I think, because 
        working with a whole lot of other people requires qualities like that. 
        Not only if they&#146;re American, but also if they&#146;re from other 
        countries. </span></P>
      <P><span class="body">And if you can do things to develop your own level 
        of those qualities, then the astronaut program will be looking for people 
        like you.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: So Susan, do you have any of your own personal 
        qualities that you feel make you good for this position?</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Susan: That&#146;s a hard one. I would say that I&#146;m 
        pretty conscientious. I&#146;m also trying to be patient and I&#146;m 
        also looking at things with a very open mind. I like to see things from 
        other people&#146;s point of view and I think that when people don&#146;t 
        view the world with a more open attitude of being able to see everybody&#146;s 
        point of view, it can get you in trouble. And I&#146;d like to think that 
        that&#146;s part of one of the reasons I can be successful up here working 
        with a huge ground team of thousands of people.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: Well Susan, it sounds like you&#146;re very 
        open minded. And being an astronaut seems to be a very meaningful position 
        for you. What does it feel like for you personally when a shuttle takes 
        off?</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Susan: When a shuttle takes off, it&#146;s basically 
        like riding a fairly rough train ride. I&#146;ve done that five times 
        now and every time it feels about the same. I basically just keep myself 
        strapped in the seat very, very tightly. There are some good movies that 
        are out there that you can watch that give you an idea of what the shaking, 
        rattling and rolling is like, because they&#146;re fairly accurate movies 
        in that respect. And the one thing it can&#146;t really show you in the 
        movies are the G forces that you feel. </span></P>
      <P><span class="body">But those G forces don&#146;t last a whole long time. 
        They&#146;re only about a few minutes long and there are things you can 
        do to your body to offset the push you feel from all those G forces, and 
        I&#146;ve had a lot of practice doing that since I&#146;ve done this about 
        five times. </span></P>
      <P><span class="body">But in any case, the emotional feeling of launching 
        into space overwhelms just about every other feeling. And that emotional 
        rush is not going to be beat.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: Now Susan, I think the most important thing 
        we can hear about today is your perspective of young women. We&#146;d 
        like to know what you wish most for these girls and women of today. In 
        that sense, what are you hoping to change or impact through your own experiences?</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Susan: Well what I wish for all the girls and young 
        women today is for them to know that if there&#146;s something they really 
        want to do, go do it. I think the young women I&#146;ve met, so many times 
        so many of them feel like there are barriers that they simply don&#146;t 
        have the energy or time to fight. And I would tell them that those barriers 
        often aren&#146;t as strong or in existence as they may think. And so 
        sometimes the worst barrier of all for a young woman is what&#146;s in 
        her head.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">So I wish for all young women today is to look at 
        things from that perspective and to realize that if there&#146;s something 
        they really, really want to do, oftentimes it&#146;s just hard work and 
        endurance and persistence that ends up getting you past those barriers, 
        and they shouldn&#146;t ever think that there&#146;s something they can&#146;t 
        do because of external forces. It&#146;s all something that you can work 
        on from within and you can go far once you put your mind to it.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: Well thank you, Susan, you are truly an inspiration. 
        I&#146;m wondering if we have time for a couple more questions?</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Susan: Sure, go ahead.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: Okay. If you could tell us a little bit more 
        about your family, we&#146;re going to meet your mother next week. Could 
        you tell us a little about your relationship with her and what impact 
        your family had on your development?</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Susan: My relationship with my mother is pretty good. 
        She&#146;s obviously been a very key point of support here as I&#146;m 
        going through this whole experience. And I&#146;ve been very close to 
        all my family members all my life, and I think that&#146;s probably important 
        and has helped me a lot to be where I am today. </span></P>
      <P><span class="body">I would say that the family and the kind of support 
        you get at home has a lot to do with how your self-esteem is as you grow 
        older. And it&#146;s very important for this to be the case for young 
        girls, because they often have a problem with self-esteem. So I have been 
        blessed to have a wonderful family, including my mother, and they continue 
        to support me as I&#146;m up here, and I thank them for that.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: Do you miss your family, especially being 
        so far away?</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Susan: Thank goodness for the invention of e-mail 
        because that really helps offset a lot of that. I do get the chance to 
        talk to a family member once a week on the space com here. And I also 
        e-mail with them several times a week, and that has done a lot to offset 
        any feelings of homesickness. Although I don&#146;t recall ever feeling 
        homesick up here, because right now this is my home.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: Well it sounds like technology has been especially 
        useful for you. I&#146;d like to know a little bit about your Russian 
        crew mates. Is it difficult to communicate and work with them, considering 
        the language barrier?</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Susan: Well Bonnie, one of the things we&#146;ve been 
        doing in the last three or four years is trying to break that language 
        barrier. Yuri [Usechov] my commander, is now speaking very good English 
        and I am speaking pretty good Russian, and then Jim [Voss] of course speaks 
        both languages near fluently. And I would say that over the last two years, 
        the three of us have worked out a relationship whereby we can communicate 
        fully in either language, either Russian or English. </span></P>
      <P><span class="body">And I think that&#146;s been one of the keys to success 
        on this flight, working together as a team, is that we&#146;ve internally 
        managed to offset any issues of language barrier. And it&#146;s going 
        very, very well. And working with Yuri is a joy. Working with the whole 
        crew is a joy, and I think because we&#146;re able to communicate with 
        each other, we can avoid some of the problems and issues of communication. 
        Because we&#146;re able to do that, we&#146;ve learned to do that over 
        the last three years and I think that&#146;s been a key of our success.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: Well Susan, you&#146;ve accumulated five flights 
        now. And do you think being up in space and having this experience has 
        changed your perspective of life in general at all?</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Susan: Well I think that one easy answer to that is 
        that it has changed my perspective of the Earth and how it appears. It&#146;s 
        easy to look down there and see the cities on occasion, and you can see 
        evidence of humans inhabiting the planet. But there&#146;s so much more 
        of the planet that don&#146;t show the human impact and it is a beautiful 
        planet. And when you see the humans encroaching upon it, it makes you 
        realize that the world is a limited resource. And because of that, we 
        need to make sure we&#146;re taking care of it.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: So it sounds like it&#146;s definitely increased 
        your appreciation of what we have here. I think that&#146;s important 
        for the rest of us to remember, considering we only see bits and pieces 
        and you get to see the whole big beautiful Earth. </span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Susan: That&#146;s right. In fact, when you look at 
        the atmosphere, it looks like more like the skin of an apple than it does 
        as an infinite expending of air beyond the planet&#146;s surface. It looks 
        very fragile and I come back from every flight thinking that we have to 
        make sure we protect our air.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: I think that&#146;s definitely an important 
        thing to remember, Susan. Can you tell us a little bit about the type 
        of preparation you&#146;ve been through, training, schooling, both in 
        the Air Force and through NASA for your flight and your stay there?</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Susan: Well, right now the stay here, the preparation 
        for that took place mainly over the last three years. The preparation 
        for becoming an astronaut just in general took place for me about 10 or 
        11 years ago and that was something that NASA provided as a training program. 
        </span></P>
      <P><span class="body">The Air Force has been great as far as getting me 
        prepared in my career as an engineer. I&#146;ve got nothing but positive 
        things to say about that as well. My education started in 1976 when I 
        went to the Air Force Academy as you&#146;ve mentioned earlier. And from 
        there, I progressed through the engineering studies, became an Air Force 
        officer after that. Spent 10 years in the Air Force doing great experience 
        jobs and from there got selected by NASA to come to the astronaut office.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">The astronaut training is very specific and oriented 
        toward space flight, but I have to say that a lot of the things I did 
        in my previous Air Force life and in my high school life, did a lot to 
        help me prepare to be a better astronaut. So you can&#146;t come to NASA 
        with a blank slate. You have to come with at least some skills in dealing 
        with people and understanding technology prior to stepping through the 
        door at NASA because they don&#146;t try to train you at the grade school 
        level. They start right at the Ph.D. level for that.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: Sounds like you&#146;ve spent a good portion 
        of your time preparing for this, and I think you&#146;ve got some good 
        qualifications there, and I appreciate all the time that you&#146;ve spent 
        with us. How are we doing on time?</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Susan: Well Bonnie, I think I&#146;ve got at least 
        a little bit of time to congratulate you on your selection for this role. 
        I hear that this is going to be Web cast and I think that it&#146;s terrific 
        that you get a chance to be just as famous as an astronaut.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: Well I don&#146;t know about that. I think 
        you&#146;ve been through a lot more preparation than I have. But I have 
        to say that being chosen to speak with you is an honor, to say the least.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Susan: I&#146;m sure it&#146;s a well-deserved honor 
        for you and I congratulate you. It&#146;s a great experience. You&#146;re 
        the only person I&#146;m talking to today on the Earth.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: Well it&#146;s great to talk to you, Susan. 
        We have one more little question here. If you could give one piece of 
        advice to young people in school, what would it be?</span></P>
      <I>
      <P><span class="body">Graphic Picture and photograph of Susan Helms</span></P>
      </I> 
      <P><span class="body">Susan: I think that it&#146;s never too late or it&#146;s 
        never too early I should say, to start developing the good habits you 
        need to be a successful adult at whatever it is you want to do. And in 
        school, that&#146;s a good place to start developing those habits. For 
        example, doing your best is something they teach you in the classroom 
        and kids today shouldn&#146;t [schlep] that off. They should absolutely 
        try to do that.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Also staying healthy is just as important. I think 
        maybe 10-15% of the people that NASA interviews to become astronauts are 
        eventually weeded out of the process because of health reasons. And I 
        just can&#146;t emphasize enough how important this is and how there are 
        things you can do at an early age to try to keep yourself healthy. And 
        of course, I&#146;m also talking about making sure you don&#146;t do any 
        drugs.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">The habits that you develop, I guarantee you, will 
        serve you well later on and I do want to encourage young kids today to 
        make sure that they realize that whatever it is they want to do as they 
        get older, there&#146;s lots and lots of other people wanting to do the 
        same thing. And oftentimes you&#146;re a victim of your competition. And 
        so if you&#146;re doing your best and everybody else is doing their best 
        too, realize that it&#146;s still tough to get some of those jobs. That 
        the people that work the hardest are often the ones that succeed. And 
        if you&#146;re not doing your best and the others are, I think you can 
        get an idea about where that will leave you as far as getting something 
        you want.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">So it&#146;s never too early to start these habits, 
        do well in school and stay healthy, and you&#146;ll go far. You&#146;ll 
        go so much farther than so many people just by doing that.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: Well thank you, Susan. I think your wisdom 
        goes across the board for astronauts, and teachers and doctors and all 
        the like. </span></P>

        our event with Bonnie Cameron out the Ames Research Center in California, 
        speaking with Flight Engineer Susan Helms onboard the International Space 
        Station. We lost signal with the TV pictures for a few minutes there due 
        to blockage, but we&#146;re now back with the pictures and we can see 
        Susan Helms taking advantage of microgravity environment to be what for 
        normal folks on Earth would be upside down. But as everyone knows, in 
        space there is no up or down. We&#146;re able to take advantage of the 
        full volume of the International Space Station in this case, Susan Helms

      <P><span class="body">Marianne and Bonnie shown on screen</span></P>
      </I> 
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: Well welcome back. It was exhilarating to 
        speak with Susan Helms, the first woman living on the International Space 
        Station. For being an astronaut, she was very down to earth. It was definitely 
        worth getting up at 3:00 o&#146;clock in the morning last week to talk 
        to her. </span></P>
      <P><span class="body">And now we have a very special guest with us. We&#146;re 
        so thankful to have her here. On my right is Marianne Seale. Marianne 
        is someone who knows tons about being in space because she is a scientist 
        at NASA. Marianne, thanks again for being here. </span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: You&#146;re welcome, Bonnie. It is a pleasure 
        to be here.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: Now why don&#146;t you explain what kind of 
        science you&#146;re involved in just so we can kind of know where we&#146;re 
        going with this?</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: The science that I do and I&#146;m involved 
        with at NASA is called life sciences research. And it&#146;s non-human 
        life sciences research. So the JSC, Johnson Space Center is primarily 
        involved with the human experimentation. But Ames Research is involved 
        with the non-human life sciences. And that includes rats and mice and 
        bugs, flies, fish, crickets, bacteria, a variety of different organisms 
        obviously. </span></P>
      <P><span class="body">So we&#146;re looking at physiology, we&#146;re looking 
        at biology, we&#146;re looking at how the organism works. How the muscles 
        and the bone and the brain and the blood work together on Earth as well 
        as in a microgravity environment.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: So you know, you would know a lot about what 
        Susan&#146;s experiencing because you know a lot about life up in space.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: Well,</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: What you study is what you&#146;re experimenting.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: Exactly. Exactly.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: So then, let&#146;s talk a little bit about 
        what we just saw with Susan Helms. And at first I wanted to ask you a 
        little bit, it sounded like she was congested when she was talking. Why 
        is that?</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: One of things that happens of course on 
        Earth with gravity, which pulls everything down. And so to walk around 
        at all, you know that a lot of the fluids actually pool in the bottom 
        part of your body.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: Okay, because they&#146;re lower.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: Because that&#146;s a gravity effect. Now 
        when you&#146;re in microgravity, the fluids redistribute so that in fact 
        it doesn&#146;t all pool at he bottom of your body. It pools up into the 
        upper part of your body also and certainly up into the head region. And 
        so basically astronauts feel like they&#146;ve got a cold. They have a 
        stuffy nose, they have a congestion in the sinus area. And in fact, if 
        you notice, her face actually was a little puffy.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: Yeah, I did notice that. I thought maybe she 
        was sick.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: No. And one of the other effects of being 
        in microgravity is that you get skinny legs. </span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: Is that because the fluid is [talkover]</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: Because the fluid is moving up as well as 
        over the long term, you do have some changes in bone and muscle. But if 
        you look at in the astronaut as pulling themselves around, you can see 
        that the legs are typically thinner than what they would be on Earth, 
        and the upper body and the head is more inflated as a function of the 
        fluid shift.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: I like what you&#146;re talking about with 
        the changing of the bones and muscle. So let&#146;s go into a little bit 
        more about weightlessness. We have a question here from CPC Kids at Work. 
        And they want to know what weightlessness feels like. </span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Now obviously, you&#146;ve not been to space, you 
        work on research.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: I&#146;ve not been to space.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: But you can tell us about weightlessness. 
        So why don&#146;t we talk a little bit about what happens to the body 
        in weightlessness.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: We&#146;ve evolved, we&#146;ve grown up 
        in a weigh-bearing environment. So what happens when you go into space 
        is that all the physiology, all the biology has to adjust. And in fact, 
        the body is a marvelous thing, adjusting to a microgravity environment. 
        It does all the right things. And it does it in a very rapid fashion as 
        a matter of fact.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">So you do, because you&#146;ve lost the impact of 
        weight in the microgravity environment, you lose some of the bone in the 
        lower part of the body. You lose some of the muscle mass in the lower 
        part of the body. You have this fluid shift. The astronauts tend to use 
        the upper part of their bodies far more than the lower part of the body.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: Yeah I noticed that in the [screen].</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: They will pull themselves along rather than 
        using their legs for pushing off. Because you don&#146;t walk in microgravity, 
        you float. </span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: And so to your question, that&#146;s what 
        weightlessness is like floating. </span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: It&#146;s floating. And in fact much of 
        the training that the astronauts do is in a floating type of environment. 
        It&#146;s in what&#146;s called a neutral buoyancy tank at Johnson Space 
        Center.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">So they are like scuba diving in water, because water 
        is one of the ways where they can have a neutral buoyancy effect. They 
        can feel like they&#146;re floating. And many of the operations, such 
        as what&#146;s happening on Space Station right now, installing the Canadian 
        robotic arm was practiced in the neutral buoyancy tank at JSC.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: So is being underwater the same as being in 
        outer space? Like if someone wanted to know what that feels like, could 
        you just swim in the pool and get kind of an idea?</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: I think it would be close. I think you can 
        get an idea. I think people that do a lot of diving and do a lot of scuba 
        diving in particular, not snorkeling per se, but diving, will have a sense 
        of what it feels like to be in microgravity. It&#146;s not the same thing, 
        but I do want to say that he astronauts in general love being weightless. 
        They truly enjoy being in a microgravity environment.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: Yes, we saw her practicing her gymnastics. 
        At least she does get a little time to have fun during her floating. </span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: Absolutely. </span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: Okay. I also wanted to ask you. We noticed 
        that while she was speaking with us, Jim Voss, one of her crew mates brought 
        her over a water bottle, and well I&#146;m assuming it was water. And 
        I wondered if we could talk a little bit about that. Why wasn&#146;t it 
        a normal water bottle?</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: Well I&#146;ll assume that it&#146;s water 
        also. But it could be fruit juice. One of the things that happens in a 
        weightless environment obviously is you have to be very careful of things 
        breaking. You have to do that here also. If you drop a bottle on the floor, 
        you have to be very careful and think of glass shards and glass pieces. 
        But in a microgravity environment, that glass would float. And it would 
        go in a variety of different places around the space station. And it could 
        severely affect some of the functioning of the electricity and the fans, 
        as well as be a real danger to the astronauts themselves.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: So it really could interfere with what was 
        going on?</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: Absolutely.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: So is there any glass at all on the Space 
        Station?</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: I don&#146;t think I can answer that question 
        exactly. I don&#146;t know. But if there is, it&#146;s very well protected, 
        it&#146;s very well insulated, it&#146;s covered in some thing so that 
        if it does break,</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: It won&#146;t be a risk.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: ...it won&#146;t be a risk. You won&#146;t 
        have pieces of glass all over the place. It&#146;s kind of like the windshield 
        that would shatter rather than-, or crack rather than shatter.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: That are made specially for that purpose.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: Right. So it would be something like that. 
        </span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: Well I&#146;m glad that they take those precautions. 
        Now since you are a researcher, and we&#146;re talking about this glass 
        on the Space Station, I think we should probably talk a little bit about 
        the background of research. I realize there are many different kinds of 
        research. It can go all across the board, but can you tell us about the 
        different types?</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: Well we all know that there are different 
        kinds of research and we&#146;re talking everything from geology to astrophysics 
        to chemistry to the biology that I do. Within all of those disciplines, 
        I believe, you have really two basic kinds of research that you can follow. 
        One is a basic research where you&#146;re looking at investigating phenomenon, 
        asking questions, and it&#146;s primarily for knowledge&#146;s sake. It 
        isn&#146;t necessarily towards an end, it&#146;s to get information.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: So basically research is just finding information?</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: It is. And trying to understand,</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: It&#146;s exploring.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: ...it&#146;s very much like exploring, exactly.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: Okay.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: Now the other side of the research realm 
        is applied research. And this is the kind of research that really has 
        a focus, it really has an end point. For example, there are people that 
        specifically look at how to cure particular types of cancers. How to cure 
        diabetes. How to deal with cardiovascular problems, very specifically. 
        And what they use often times is in fact the research that, and the knowledge 
        that&#146;s been gathered from the basic research.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: I see. So the basic research just gives us 
        our knowledge, but then using that with our applied research, we can come 
        up with some sort of answer that&#146;s useful to us.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: Hopefully. </span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: We hope so. Okay, so there&#146;s two different 
        types of research. Now we have a question here in the chat room from Jane, 
        and she wants to know why do you do research in space?</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: Well, that&#146;s a very good question, 
        Jane. Gravity. Gravity is the basic story. It&#146;s something you have 
        on Earth and it&#146;s something you don&#146;t have in space. So both 
        in the basic as well as in the applied areas of research, gravity is a 
        very important variable and you can go into space and take the opportunity 
        to remove that variable from your science.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">So we evolved on Earth, we, from the fishes and the 
        bacteria up to the human being, we have grown up individually as a child 
        to adulthood in the gravity environment. All of our systems are used to 
        being in a gravity environment. The only way we can understand the effect 
        of gravity, and the only place we can take gravity away is in space.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: I see.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: It&#146;s the only opportunity to do that 
        kind of basic research.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: Now in space, is it only basic research? Or 
        is it applied research as well?</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: It&#146;s absolutely also applied research 
        too.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: Wow, so they can do both?</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: Absolutely. And the reason you want to do 
        that is in a microgravity environment, as we talked about earlier, there 
        are effects on bone and muscle as well as on the cardiovascular system. 
        If we are interested, and this is in the applied sense, of continuing 
        our explorations out into space, the Moon, Mars, and beyond, we have to 
        know. We have to know what happens in space, and we have to know how to 
        what&#146;s called &quot;provide counter measures&quot; if required. </span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Measures to reduce the amount of bone loss, and reduce 
        the amount of muscle mass. And the primary reason, well there&#146;s two 
        reasons. One is, after you make this space voyage and you get to the Moon 
        or you get to Mars, or you get to wherever, that will probably have some 
        kind of gravity effect. And you want to be able to explore, you want to 
        be able to function in that gravity environment.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: [inaudible] once you get there.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: The other issue is what if there&#146;s 
        an emergency? What if you have to come back to Earth or you have to go 
        someplace else very rapidly? You have to be able to function there also, 
        not just for exploring, planned exploring, but also in an emergency setting. 
        So we do both basic research and applied research in space.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: So even the fact that the astronauts are in 
        space, would be basic research because by them being there, with no gravity, 
        we&#146;re learning more about how their bodies adjust?</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: Absolutely.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: Okay.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: And there&#146;s a relationship, I&#146;m 
        sorry, a relationship too in terms of what happens in space to back down 
        on Earth. We have states in Earth where there is little gravity effects 
        on bone and muscle. People that are sick, people that are in bed rest 
        for days, weeks, months, these are the kinds of things that in fact have 
        a relationship to some of the things that happen in microgravity. And 
        some of the things we learn in space, we can bring back to Earth.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">[talkover]</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: So we [inaudible]</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: You bet.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: [inaudible] to help life on Earth.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: Absolutely. </span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: So that is why we do research at NASA in outer 
        space? We made a connection there. We have another interesting questions 
        here from Fran, and I want to bring it up, because I think it&#146;s very 
        relevant. She says here in the chat room, is it safe to do research in 
        space? Are there any risks? And I think that&#146;s important because 
        we do have people up in space and we&#146;re learning about their bodies 
        changing, but are there risks?</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: Of course there are risks.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: Of course.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: Absolutely.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: Okay, let&#146;s talk a little bit about those 
        risks.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: It&#146;s risky on Earth as we well know.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: Yes.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: And you take an organism, be it a human, 
        be it a non-human into space, it&#146;s obviously very risky. It certainly 
        can be classified if you will as a hostile environment. Without the Space 
        Station, without the space shuttle, we would never be there. You have 
        to be enclosed, you can&#146;t be-, you have to have air provided, you 
        have to have water provided. It&#146;s a risky environment.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">I personally feel, and I think many people feel, that 
        the risk is worth it. But it is risky and that&#146;s one of the reasons 
        why we do so much ground testing. We take a long time to get from point 
        A to point B, from the inception of an idea to the implementation of that 
        idea in space. It takes a long time.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: So how long does it take? Like what does it 
        take to get to space, for experiments first of all?</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: For the researchers and the experiments 
        that I work with, typically you&#146;re talking at least three years. 
        And what happens</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: That&#146;s a long time.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: It&#146;s a long time. But there&#146;s 
        a lot of work to happen. There&#146;s a researcher who does a particular 
        experiment in his or her laboratory, on a bench top, with a bunch of vials 
        and beakers and equipment. NASA needs to take that procedure and package 
        it differently because it&#146;s going to be done in microgravity.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: Right.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: You can&#146;t put beakers on the tabletop 
        in microgravity. It doesn&#146;t work.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: And that research, that person who&#146;s 
        working on the table, they won&#146;t be going up to space with their 
        project will they?</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: That is exactly the case, you&#146;re so 
        right. So we have to train people to do the experiment. </span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: So is that included in the three-year time?</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: That&#146;s definitely included in the three 
        years. You have to work the hardware, you have to work the experiment 
        itself, you have to work the crew. It&#146;s a very, the simplest experiment 
        you can do on Earth can be very complex when you try and take it into 
        a microgravity environment. It&#146;s worth it, it&#146;s totally worth 
        it, but it takes a while to do it. It&#146;s very creative.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: Right.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: It challenges your creativity. </span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: So, it takes three years. Can any experiment 
        go up to space? Like, what does it take? Are there constraints?</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: Yes there certainly are constraints. One 
        of the things is what happens is NASA receives from investigators around 
        the country, proposals for experiments that they want to do. Those proposals 
        pass a scientific peer review that says this is really good science. This 
        type of science should fly because it really answers, asks a good question.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: Sounds like a recommendation.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: It&#146;s a total recommendation. Then that 
        proposal comes to us as a technical review. And we look at it and we say, 
        &quot;You know what, that is really good science, but you know what, we 
        don&#146;t fly giraffes.&quot; It&#146;s just not possible. </span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: So if I&#146;m doing an experiment with a 
        giraffe, I won&#146;t be able to fly it?</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: I don&#146;t think so. We would ask you</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: Well why not?</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: We would ask you to reconsider your organisms.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: Okay.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: Perhaps you could do that experiment in 
        a rat or perhaps you could do it in a mouse.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: So rat goes to space.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: We fly rats and we fly mice.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: And not giraffes?</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: And not giraffes.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: Darn it. Well okay, so obviously this brings 
        about the issue of size and space in outer space. </span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: That is true.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: So are there any other constraints? Are there 
        any other things to think about when you&#146;re sending an experiment 
        up?</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: Yes. Obviously if you remember looking at 
        what&#146;s on the Space Station now and if you&#146;ve ever seen picture 
        of Mir, the Russian space station, things are very crowded. There&#146;s 
        a lot of stuff up there.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: Right.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: And there&#146;s a lot of pieces of hardware, 
        there&#146;s valves going here and tubing and size is a very critical 
        issue. An experiment that&#146;s done on a table top like we&#146;re sitting 
        at here, if it goes into space, needs to be miniaturized, brought down 
        into a much smaller volume.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Weight is also issue. Now obviously in microgravity 
        that&#146;s not a huge issue, </span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: Right.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: But we still have to launch it. We still 
        have to fight against gravity to get it into the microgravity environment.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: So how much is weight really an issue? Like 
        are we talking you can&#146;t be 500 pounds or is it down to every last 
        gram?</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: It&#146;s down to every last gram, absolutely. 
        </span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: Well I&#146;m not surprised, but.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: And the other constraint certainly is power. 
        It takes a lot of power to run the space station or to run the shuttle. 
        Obviously our first concern is the crew, and make sure that they are comfortable, 
        that they are safe, they have sufficient water, they have sufficient light, 
        they have sufficient air, ventilation. And then the question is what&#146;s 
        left? What can we use to run other experiments besides the crew in the 
        space shuttle around the Space Station.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">And so there is a premium on experiments that take 
        not very much power, that are very small, that don&#146;t weigh very much.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: And are good science.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: And are excellence science. Good point. 
        </span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: All right, well we were speaking about the 
        crew and how they are very important. They&#146;re our first priority. 
        We have another question here from CPC kid.work in our chat room. And 
        they&#146;d like to know what happens if there is a medical emergency 
        up in space?</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: A medical emergency. </span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: Well for that case, any type of an emergency. 
        If something goes wrong with one of the experiments or.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: Well let&#146;s talk about a medical emergency. 
        Thus far, to my knowledge, we&#146;ve been very fortunate. We have not 
        had a medical emergency per se on the shuttle or on the Space Station. 
        There have been concerns with some of the cosmonauts that have flown on 
        Mir. There were potential cardiovascular problems with one or two of the 
        cosmonauts there. </span></P>
      <P><span class="body">We do the best we can, first of all to send healthy 
        people. But there&#146;s always a risk. There&#146;s always something 
        that can happen. Often times we have medical personnel that fly on the 
        shuttle or on the Space Station. </span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: That&#146;s a good idea.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: And that&#146;s also a good idea. That&#146;s 
        one of the reasons we have escape vehicles on the Space Station. On the 
        shuttle, we always have an opportunity because it circles the Earth every 
        90 minutes, to bring the shuttle down if there&#146;s a problem. </span></P>
      <P><span class="body">On the Space Station, we have escape vehicles that 
        can bring the troubled astronaut down to the Earth environment.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: Now what about experiments? Because I know 
        that things don&#146;t always go as planned. Does it happen where something 
        happens that you&#146;re not expecting?</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: It happens, it&#146;s something you have 
        to plan for. You have to plan for the unexpected and that&#146;s sounds 
        kind of contradictory, but it&#146;s absolutely the case. When we fly 
        and experiment on the shuttle, we are asked to come up with a book, basically, 
        that says what is everything that can go wrong? What can go wrong with 
        the electrical power? What can go wrong with the fans? What can go wrong 
        with the lights? What can go wrong with X,Y and Z, and come up with a 
        plan to fix that.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">And so there&#146;s always a big issue in terms of 
        contingency. What is it that we need to do in order to fix something? 
        And hopefully, we don&#146;t have to use it. But there certainly have 
        been times when we have had to look into the books and come up with a 
        way of dealing with problems. </span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: Okay, so NASA must do a very good job of preparing 
        for any type of difficulty that goes on?</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: Absolutely.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: I&#146;ve heard a lot about NASA safety, so 
        I&#146;m glad to know that. Now I&#146;d like to know a little bit about 
        your experience. We have a question here about, from Amber in the chat 
        room. She wants to know how did your education prepare you for this job, 
        and then after we hear about your education, we&#146;re going to hear 
        more about what you&#146;ve actually done personally with your experiments, 
        and she&#146;s had some that have gone up to space.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">First let&#146;s talk a little bit about your education 
        just really briefly so that Amber can know how you got started.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: Okay, Amber. Went to the typical high school, 
        went to college at the University of Wisconsin, where I grew up. I then 
        went on to graduate school at the University of Chicago. I majored in 
        psychology when I was in undergraduate school, and then in graduate school 
        recognized that I really wanted to know more about biology as well as 
        psychology.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">So emphasize the &quot;biological basis of behavior&quot; 
        is what it&#146;s called. And Bonnie and I have talked about this earlier. 
        To me, science is like a mystery novel. It&#146;s a whodunit kind of story. 
        </span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: I think so.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: And it&#146;s very exciting. To me you always, 
        always have more questions. I can remember when I was in undergraduate 
        school and asking people that were doing research there, how do you do 
        this? How do you know, how do you keep on going? And the person that I 
        was talking to was just laughing. He said, &quot;There&#146;s always another 
        question.&quot;</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: Didn&#146;t that bother you that you could 
        never have an answer, or did you like it?</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: No, it&#146;s exciting. I like it. I like 
        it a lot, because we always do get an answer. You get an answer to some 
        part of the question.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: But then you have to go [on more].</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: But then there&#146;s another part of the 
        question that&#146;s out there and [it&#146;s something] that you just 
        don&#146;t expect. And so it&#146;s always a surprise and it&#146;s always 
        very, very interesting.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: Well life is exciting.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: Yes.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: Okay, now let&#146;s talk about your NeuroLab. 
        This is very exciting. You have [talkover]</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: Let me tell you about NeuroLab, definitely.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: You tell me about NeuroLab.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: Okay, NeuroLab flew in 1998 and it was at 
        this point the last dedicated life sciences research mission. Every experiment 
        on the NeuroLab flight, and that&#146;s human as well as non-human, was 
        dedicated to life sciences. And in particular, it was related to the physiology 
        community had dedicated the 1990s as the decade of the brain.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Understanding how the brain controls and modifies 
        physiology. And so NeuroLab was part of a consortium with the national 
        institutes of health, as well as with NASA to look very seriously at what 
        are the effects of microgravity on the brain, and then how do those effects, 
        translate down into the physiology of bone, of muscle, of cardiovascular 
        and of behavior. </span></P>
      <P><span class="body">And so it was a very exciting mission. It was a very 
        exciting mission. </span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: Now what made you, because I guess it&#146;s 
        hard to think, when I think when me and when most people think about gravity, 
        we don&#146;t think of the effects on the brain, we think of it more on 
        the muscle then the body. So what were some of your findings as far as, 
        well I guess where did you come, where did you think of the idea that 
        it would have an effect on the brain, and that you wanted to study it? 
        And what were some of your findings?</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: Well one of the things that we know about 
        for sure is that there is a very profound, a very strong link back and 
        forth, obviously between the brain, the body and the behavior. And so, 
        and it&#146;s a feedback system. It isn&#146;t just a one-way street. 
        The brain controls the body and controls the behavior, but there is feedback.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">So as you move, as you function, it feeds back into 
        the brain. It&#146;s a constant two-way, three-way signal that goes round 
        and round and round, constantly modifying.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: That are all interconnected.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: Absolutely. Which is one of the reasons 
        why it makes it so interesting as well as challenging. </span></P>
      <P><span class="body">[talkover]</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: A lot to keep track of, I&#146;m sure.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: So we had a number of different parts of 
        NeuroLab. We had a part of NeuroLab that was mammalian development. And 
        this is looking at rats with their young, their neonates. That&#146;s 
        one group. And looking at the effects of microgravity on brain function, 
        on hormone function, the thyroid gland, locomotion. How does a microgravity 
        environment feed back in terms of altering how the young rats learn how 
        to walk?</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">What else? Cardiovascular function, how the heart 
        works. And what was wonderful is that we had six experimenters that had 
        all proposed studies to be done. And we were able to bring them together 
        and they were all able to share the animals in this research and all get 
        their scientific objectives and work together.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: All six?</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: All six. So that part was particularly exciting.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: Wow.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: In order to bring everybody together and 
        have them work together in such a positive manner, and it was an international 
        group also. We had people from France, people from Japan, as well as people 
        from the Unites States.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: Was it difficult considering the different 
        languages?</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: It had its challenges. Not impossible, but 
        it certainly had its challenges. It&#146;s always a case when you deal 
        with a team environment and that&#146;s not just the international, but 
        it&#146;s also when you deal across science, engineering and bureaucrats, 
        to be very clear that the communication is well understood.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Just because I use a particular word, doesn&#146;t 
        mean that you understand it.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: Right.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: And it&#146;s particularly the case if you&#146;re 
        dealing across culture.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: Definitely.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: And across time and space. </span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: Well, I just want to remind our viewers, because 
        we have five minutes left to go, that you can access the chat with Susan 
        Helms&#146; mother. Now remember Susan Helms is who I spoke to on the 
        International Space Station. Her mother will be with us today at 12:00 
        o&#146;clock Pacific Time, and you&#146;ll be able to chat with her online 
        along with our Young Women of NASA Advisory Council members. So be sure 
        to join into that and you can find out more about Susan Helms&#146; childhood 
        and a little more about her mother.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Now we have another question. I want to ask you coming 
        from the chat room, in the future, will there be any way to simulate gravity 
        with a space-type station [on a ship]? So I think that&#146;s a interesting 
        question.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: A really good question.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: Because when we go into space, does it always 
        have to be microgravity, or is there a way to impose gravity while in 
        the Space Station?</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: Well we&#146;re fooled, fooled? We&#146;re 
        promised certain things in movies and in the end, television, that looks 
        like in the weightless-, in space you should be able to walk around on 
        the ground. We&#146;re not there yet. We&#146;re definitely not there 
        yet, and certainly not there in terms of the human experience.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">I know I&#146;ve asked engineers the same question, 
        and at this point, it doesn&#146;t look too feasible. It&#146;s not my 
        field. But it does not look feasible. Now, just to stay with research 
        a little bit and moving away from humans a little bit, one of the things 
        that&#146;s actually being built through Ames Research Center here, is 
        a future module for the Space Station called the Centrifuge Accommodation 
        module. And it is a module that goes up on the Space Station and it has 
        a centrifuge in it. You know what a centrifuge is, right?</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: Right.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: Round and round and round and it will create 
        gravity in space, so that we can put our non-human research animals, the 
        rats, the mice, the plants, the bugs, the fish in a gravity environment. 
        And do that type of experimentation in space. Do a half a gravity or twice 
        as much gravity. And use that potentially as a counter measure to some 
        of the effects.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: Now I want to get to one more question. We 
        just have one or two more minutes before we finish, </span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: Okay.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: But I think this is very important. We&#146;ve 
        talked a lot about your research, and we talked a lot about the basic 
        and applied research that goes on in space. But I think it&#146;s important 
        for all of us to know what happens with this research? How can, how does 
        it benefit life on Earth? </span></P>
      <P><span class="body">I know we spoke a little bit about bones and muscles, 
        and people who are on bed rest, so can you tell us a little bit more about 
        how can it benefit us?</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: The research that goes on in space?</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: Yeah. Like what we learn about the rats. Can 
        we apply that to our life or what we know about our brain?</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: Oh yes, definitely. Definitely. Yes. </span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: It&#146;s a pretty big question.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: I&#146;m a little bit stymied at this, but 
        I can tell you about one experiment if we have enough time.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: Sure.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: This is in fact an experiment that is a 
        cell culture experiment. It&#146;s where the experimenter has taken a 
        group of cells, and these particularly are bone cells, and are growing 
        them in a cell culture. And what happens is it&#146;s interesting, you 
        don&#146;t have to be a full organism in order to experience changes in 
        bone and muscle. In fact, the microgravity effect can be direct on the 
        cells.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: So you don&#146;t even need a body?</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: No, you don&#146;t need a body. But this 
        experimenter is proposing to create a drug delivery system if you will, 
        from one&#146;s own cells, by taking those cells out of your body for 
        example, small little piece, doing some genetic therapy, some genetic 
        recombination therapy, and being able to put that piece back in your body. 
        </span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Now the beauty of that is that you will not reject 
        that. It is your tissue, it is your cells, and so your body accepts that. 
        Accepts it along with this genetic modification that allows for a drug 
        delivery system. That&#146;s being tested in a upcoming shuttle flight 
        in the cell culture.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: So I&#146;ll be able to take my old part back 
        and the new part and hopefully it&#146;ll help me.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: That is correct.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: Well that&#146;s great.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: Because you can genetically engineer a drug 
        delivery, a hormone that naturally occurs in the body, that may be deficient 
        in space or deficient in a diseased state on the Earth, and uses that 
        way.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: Love this research. Okay, thank you all for 
        joining us and thank you very much, Marianne.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Marianne: It&#146;s wonderful.</span></P>
      <P><span class="body">Bonnie: You are full of wisdom and good luck in the 
        future with all of your research. I hope you&#146;ll join us again so 
        you can share more findings with us. Thank you all for joining us for 
        this live webcast brought to you by NASA-Quest. Please make sure to join 
        us throughout the day for the rest of our interactive events in honor 
        of our virtual <I>Take Our Daughters To Work</I> day.</span></P>
