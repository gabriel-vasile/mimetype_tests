<HR>
<P>My name is Marianne Laouri, and I am Director of Quality Measurement and
Research at PacifiCare Health Systems, a network model managed care organization
operating health plans in 13 states and Guam, with a membership of more than 4
million lives, including nearly one million Medicare beneficiaries.</P>
<P>I appreciate the opportunity to participate in today's hearing.  My comments
will focus on the issues of confidentiality and privacy of individual level
data.  Safeguarding of member enrollment, demographic and medical care related
information is of great importance to PacifiCare.  PacifiCare supports this
Committees' efforts to protect against the unauthorized and inappropriate use of
individually identifiable information while promoting efficiency and security of
the health information infrastructure.</P>
<P>PacifiCare's efforts to ensure security and confidentiality of member
information include:</P>
<UL>
<LI> Requiring that employees sign a Confidentiality agreement;
</LI>
<LI> Enforcing a policy that addresses the consequences of improper use of
confidential information;
</LI>
<LI> Allowing access to member and provider level information (demographic and
clinical) only to individuals whose job responsibilities require that they use
confidential information;
</LI>
<LI> Maintaining information system controls including warnings on front log-on
screens, unique log-on identifiers and passwords, and electronic audit trails.
</LI></UL>
<P>PacifiCare also enforces the above confidentiality rules with contract
employees, consultants and academic collaborators who require access to
confidential information.</P>
<P>It is important to bear in mind that managed care organizations, such as
PacifiCare, use individually identifiable information for a variety of their
core business processes, such as</P>
<UL>
<LI> utilization review,
</LI>
<LI> appeals and grievances,
</LI>
<LI> quality management and improvement, and internal research
</LI>
<LI> payment of claims
</LI></UL>
<P>In addition, health plans use individually identifiable data to prepare
reports to respond to requests for information from the federal government,
state agencies and regulatory bodies, accrediting organizations and employers
and purchasers.  Examples of such reports include:</P>
<UL>
<LI> reports on claims payment and processing,
</LI>
<LI> description of the appeals and grievance process,
</LI>
<LI> health plan performance data as specified in the Health Employer Data
Information Set (i.e., HEDIS), and
</LI>
<LI> clinical performance measures for individual with certain medical
conditions (e.g., diabetes measures from the Foundation for Accountability).
</LI></UL>
<P>These reports do not contain individual specific information.</P>
<P>Individually identifiable information plays a crucial role in a managed care
organization's ability to carry out quality measurement and improvement
activities including:</P>
<UL>
<LI> data collection and analysis both to identify clinical areas or providers
needing improvement and to identify the most effective and successful medical
management strategies;
</LI>
<LI> measurement of quality as specified in a nationally accepted clinical
practice guideline that the managed care organization adopts and disseminates
among its members and providers;
</LI>
<LI> investigate of individual cases for the purpose of care management; and
</LI>
<LI> analyses of underuse and overuse to assure appropriate care is delivered
to the plan members.
</LI></UL>
<P>Access to and use of individually identifiable information is critical for
trend analysis, care management, provider and member education, as well as for
preparation of reports which enable purchasers and consumers to evaluate health
plans.</P>
<P>Therefore, PacifiCare encourages this Committee to continue its efforts on
promoting efficiency and security of the health information infrastructure. 
Such efforts will allow managed care organizations and other legitimate users of
individually identifiable information to maintain access to this information
while safeguarding privacy and confidentiality.</P>
<P>PacifiCare will be happy to provide the Committee with any additional
information on the internal security measures and on the uses of individually
identifiable data.</P></BODY></HTML>
