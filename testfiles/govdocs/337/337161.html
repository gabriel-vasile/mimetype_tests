    <p><img src="Heiskell.jpg" width="154" height="217" alt="Heiskell.BMP (340854 bytes)" align="left">OAK RIDGE, Tenn. &#150; </b> Marianne Heiskell has been named to lead the
    Department of Energy&#146;s Land Use Planning Initiative for the U.S. Department of
    Energy&#146;s 34,242-acre Oak Ridge Reservation. </p>
    <p>Heiskell is leading the Oak Ridge Reservation Use Planning process, which includes an
    extensive review of the near- and long-term requirements of the Department of Energy's
    (DOE) science, environmental management, and national security missions at the Oak Ridge
    facilities. This includes working very closely for the next year with the Land Use Focus
    Group, which includes 22 members of the public representing a wide range of business,
    conservancy, environmental, and historical preservation interests.</p>
    <p>Leah Dever, ORO Manager, said, &quot;I am pleased that Marianne is leading our new land
    use initiative to expand public involvement in the future land use planning of the Oak
    Ridge Reservation. Marianne will work closely with the Land Use Focus Group and will help
    develop a comprehensive land use plan that we can use for the next five years.&quot; </p>
    <p>In 1980, Heiskell joined DOE and served until 1989 as a logistics/transportation
    management specialist. In 1989, she established the first DOE Site Office at the K-25 Site
    (now East Tennessee Technology Park) and served for two years as the DOE Site Manager.<br>
    <br>
    Beginning in 1991, she served in the Office of the Assistant Manager for Environmental
    Management (EM). Over the years, her responsibilities included development of the EM
    Planning Documents and serving as DOE Administrator/Ex-Officio to the EM Citizens Advisory
    Board. In 1999, Heiskell was chosen to be the Transition Manager to accomplish the
    transfer of security activities from the DOE site contractors to a DOE prime contract with
    Wackenhut Services Inc. &#150; Oak Ridge (WSI). This included the transition of more than
    500 employees to WSI. <br>
    <br>
    Prior to joining DOE, Heiskell worked at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) with
    responsibilities in the transport of radioactive and hazardous materials and participation
    in the development of transportation routing and tracking models for shipments of spent
    fuel and other shipments. </p>
    <p>A native of Morristown, Heiskell received a bachelor of science degree in logistics
    planning/ transportation from The University of Tennessee in Knoxville. </p>
    <p>Heiskell is an active member of Faith Promise Church on Pellissippi Parkway. She has
    served on the leadership team and currently serves in the Promisekids program directing
    teachers of kindergarten through 6<sup>th</sup> grade and leads the 6<sup>th</sup> graders
    herself. </p>
    <p>Heiskell and her husband, Jim Heiskell, retired ORNL food service assistant manager,
    live in Knoxville. They have one grown son, Ted. </p>
