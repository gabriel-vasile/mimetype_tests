   <DD>Dear Marianne,
   <DD>I&#39;m sorry for the delay in sending you the information about translation of the globin sequence in SV40-beta-globin cDNA recombinants.  We have a few experiments in progress, hopefully to be finished in the next few weeks, that would provide a better understanding than I could give you in Koln. We should have finished the determination on an experiment we have collaborated OR with Charles Weissmann. He constructed rabbit beta-globin cDNA &#34;mutations&#34; in which various portions of the 5&#39;-sequence of the beta-globin cDNA have been deleted (including one with the AUG gene)  and we have inserted these into SV40 to see how much of the sequence in front of  the beta-globin AUG is needed for expression. In the meantime I enclose a reprint of our Jan. Nature paper. I&#39;ll write you as soon as the date is available which as I say is imminent.
   <DD>It was nice to see you again if only briefly. I hope we&#39;ll meet soon, hopefully if I can stop in Paris at the end of September.
   <DD>With best regards,
   <DD>Sincerely,
   <DD>Paul
