Accessibility Issues at the JFO 

• Issues “within” the building important 
– Example: Mobility carts were needed for 
JFO length greater than a football field 
• Complete resolution of issues took persistence 
– Example: cart rules (Who? How? When? 
etc.) 
– Signage (At entrances and within DFO) 
• Evacuation plans need to be tailored to 
accommodate people with a disability
