Subject: What's in your food?


Dear Corporate and Government Leaders,

Genetically engineered food ingredients or crops should not be allowed on the market until: 

1) Independent safety testing demonstrates they have no harmful effects on human health or the environment, 

2) They are labeled to ensure the consumer's right-to-know, and 

3) The biotechnology corporations that manufacture them are held responsible for any harm.

As a family of 56 people, we no longer buy any of your products for the above reasons, and we tell everyone we know about what is going on.  


Sincerely

Marianne Goodman
