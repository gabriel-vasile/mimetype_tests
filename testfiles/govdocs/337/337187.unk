Future Directions for the National Archive of
Criminal Justice Data:  Report of the Task Force,
1995
15pp, 8/95
The Bureau of Justice Statistics is developing a
comprehensive strategy to address its data
dissemination needs for the immediate future. 
Part of this planning focuses on the National
Archive of Criminal Justice Data (NACJD), which
distributes public-use data files for BJS.  New
capabilities that enhance data access, retrieval,
and dissemination capabilities are becoming
available.  BJS wishes to investigate how these
technologies might be utilized to improve the
services it provides to users of criminal justice
data.  To this end, BJS empaneled a Task Force to
provide an independent view of its efforts to
disseminate data.  The Task Force provided
comments on how NACJD maintains and disseminates
data, processes public use files, selects its
holdings, and provides user services.  In addition
to these findings, this report provides background
on the formation of the Task Force, meeting
summaries, and a list of participants.

Guns Used In Crime:  Firearms, Crime, and Criminal
Justice -- BJS Selected Findings 
7pp, 7/95, 7 tables, 1 figure; Marianne W. Zawitz,
BJS
Since there is no national collection of data
about the guns used by criminals, this report
provides information from several sources,
including the FBI National Crime Information
Center's stolen gun file, the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco, and Firearms National Tracing Center, the
BJS National Crime Victimization Survey, the FBI
Uniform Crime Reports, the BJS Survey of Inmates
in State Correctional Facilities, other inmate
surveys, and special studies of homicides
involving guns.  The report covers how often guns
are used in crime, what categories of firearms are
most often used, and what type of guns criminals
prefer. This is the first of a series of reports
on firearms and crime that will be part of a
comprehensive report entitled Firearms, Crime, and
Criminal Justice.  Includes bibliography.

CRIMES AND VICTIMS

NCJ 162031
Age Patterns of Violent Victimizations
14pp, forthcoming; Craig A. Perkins, BJS
This Special report presents the first data from
the redesigned National Crime Victimization Survey
(NCVS) that examines the characteristics of
violent crime against youth from 1992 through
1994.  It compares teenagers and young adults to
older persons and discusses the high victimization
rates of young people in the United States.  The
report focuses on the violent crimes of rape,
robbery, and aggravated assault (from the NCVS)
and homicide (from crimes reported to police).  It
includes information about the characteristics of
these violent incidents, including time and place
of occurrence, injury, and whether they were
reported to the police.  Differences in levels of
violence by race, ethnicity, sex, family income,
locales and other characteristics are
investigated.  The report covers 1992 through
1994.

NCJ 162032
Criminal Victimization 1995:  National Crime
Victimization Survey  
6pp., forthcoming; Craig  A. Perkins, Patsy A.
Klaus, BJS
This annual BJS Bulletin presents the first 1995
findings from the National Crime Victimization
Survey (NCVS), based on an ongoing survey of
households, each year interviewing about 100,000
persons in 50,000 households.  Violent crimes
included in the report are rape,  sexual assault,
robbery, and both aggravated and simple assault
(from the NCVS), and homicide (from crimes
reported to the police).  Property crimes include
burglaries, motor vehicle thefts, and thefts of
other property.  This report also summarizes other
findings, including the extent to which crimes are
reported to the police, the characteristics of
victims, and comparisons between 1994 and 1995
victimization rates and levels.  The findings are
based on the redesigned survey that was phased
into the sample beginning in 1992.

NCJ 156921
Measuring Intentional Injuries Using the National
Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS)
8pp, forthcoming; Michael R. Rand, BJS
This report presents findings from the first 12
months of data collection on intentional injuries
treated in hospital emergency rooms and describes
the Consumer Product Safety Commission's NEISS
program.  Existing estimates of
difficult-to-measure violence such as domestic
violence vary greatly, mostly because of
differences in data collection methods and lack of
consensus on the behaviors defining the violence
being measured.  In an effort to improve estimates
of serious violence, including domestic violence
and sexual assault, BJS has used NEISS since
October 1993 to collect data on intentional
injuries.  Conducted at a sample of the Nation's
hospitals to estimate product-related injuries,
NEISS was modified to obtain data on
characteristics of persons treated for
intentionally inflicted injuries, characteristics
of those causing the injury, and circumstances of
injury incidents.  

NCJ 161405
Domestic and Sexual Violence Data Collection:  
A Report to Congress under the Violence Against
Women Act
84pp, 7/96, 3 tables; Justice Research and
Statistics Association, NIJ award #95-IJ-CX-0010
This Research Report, supported by the National
Institute of Justice and the Bureau of Justice
Statistics, looks at how States and the Federal
Government collect data on the incidence of sexual
and domestic violence offenses in order to
identify ways that States could centralize data
collection on the incidence of domestic and sexual
violence and to examine problems of statistical
recordkeeping at the Federal level for domestic
violence-related criminal complaints.  Two sources
-- a panel of domestic and sexual violence experts
and a survey of the States -- were used to elicit
information.  The most significant finding was
that the Federal Government and a majority of
States (35 for domestic violence; 30 for sexual
violence) gather annual statistics on these
crimes, although issues of accuracy and
completeness of coverage were identified. 
Improving reporting and obtaining more
comprehensive statistics will require both
organizational and technical coordination and
cooperation at all levels of government.  As
mandated by Congress in the Violence Against Women
Act of 1994, the report represents an important
first step in analyzing what needs to be done to
ensure collection of reliable statistics on the
extent and nature of violent crimes committed
against women.

Criminal Victimization 1994:  National Crime
Victimization Survey   
6pp, 4/96, 8 tables; Craig A. Perkins, Patsy A.
Klaus, BJS 
This annual BJS Bulletin presents the first 1994
findings from the National Crime Victimization
Survey (NCVS), based on an ongoing survey of
households, each year interviewing about 100,000
persons in 50,000 households.  In 1994, U.S.
residents age 12 or older experienced more than 42
million crimes:  about 11 million violent
victimizations and 31 million property crimes. 
Violent crimes included in the report are rape,
sexual assault, robbery, and both aggravated and
simple assault (from the NCVS), and homicide (from
crimes reported to police).  Property crimes
include burglaries, motor vehicle thefts, and
thefts of other property.  This report also
summarizes other findings, including the extent to
which crimes are reported to the police, the
characteristics of victims, and comparisons
between 1993 and 1994 victimization rates and
levels.  Both 1993 and 1994 findings are based on
the redesigned survey that was phased into the
sample beginning in 1992.

Violence Against Women:  Estimates from the
Redesigned National Crime Victimization Survey
9pp, 8/95, 11 tables; Ronet Bachman, BJS, and
Linda E. Saltzman, Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention
This BJS Special Report is the first release of
the 1992-93 estimates of violence against women
after an extended effort to improve the
victimization survey's ability to measure violence
against women. The survey now asks more explicit
and direct questions about sexual assaults and
other victimizations perpetrated by known
offenders. Data include annual number of violent
victimizations, rapes, and sexual assaults against
women; number perpetrated by intimates (including
husbands, ex-husbands, boyfriends, and
ex-boyfriends); rates for violence by intimates
for women versus rates for men; rates for violence
and sexual assaults by strangers; age and family
income of female victims of violence; and rates of
injury.

NCJ 151658    
Criminal Victimization 1993:  National Crime
Victimization Survey
6pp, 5/95, 5 tables; Lisa D. Bastian, BJS
This annual BJS Bulletin summarizes 1993 findings
from the redesigned NCVS and presents the first
tabulations of 1992 data based on the redesigned
survey, an ongoing survey of households, each year
interviewing about 100,000 persons in 50,000
households.  In 1993, U.S. residents age 12 or
older experienced a total of 43.6 million crimes
-- nearly 11 million violent victimizations and
over 32 million property crimes.  There were 52
violent victimizations per 1,000 persons and 322
property crimes per 1,000 households.  Violent
crimes (a quarter of the total that victims
described) include rape and sexual assault,
robbery, and both aggravated and simple assault
(from the victimization survey), and homicide
(from crimes reported to police).  Property crimes
are comprised of burglaries, motor vehicle thefts,
and thefts of other property.  Improved NCVS
survey procedures and a revised questionnaire now
enable BJS to count crimes that were excluded or
unreported in previous years.  Of the 43.6 million
criminal victimizations that victims described in
1993, 10.9 million were rapes, robberies, or
assaults: 

* Violent victimization rates, the number of
crimes during 1993 per 1,000 persons age 12 or
older, included:
-- 2 rapes or attempted rapes
-- 1 sexual assault
-- 4 robberies with property taken
-- 3 assaults with serious injury.
* Victims sustained a rape or some other non-rape
injury in over 2.6 million incidents in 1993;
about 29% of the robberies involved injury.
* Males, blacks, and the young were more likely
than others to experience violent crime -- 
-- 1 in 16 males and 1 in 23 females
-- 1 in 15 blacks and 1 in 20 whites
-- 1 in 8 persons age 12 to 15 and
-- 1 in 179 persons age 65 or older.
* Persons in households with an income below
$7,500 a year were over twice as likely as those
from households with $75,000 or more to be victims
of violence.
* City dwellers were robbed at more than 3 times
the rate of rural residents.
* City dwellers' households were victimized by
motor vehicle theft at almost 5 times the rate of
rural households.
* An estimated 35% of the crimes described by
victims were reported to law enforcement
authorities.  Violent victimizations had the
highest reporting rate, 42%, compared to 27% of
personal thefts and 34% of household property
crimes.

spouses, ex-spouses, boyfriends, or girlfriends. 
It uses data from the BJS National Crime
Victimization Survey, the BJS survey of murder
cases disposed in large urban counties in 1988,
and the FBI Supplemental Homicide Report from the
Uniform Crime Reports program.  Data on violent
offenders were collected in the 1991 Survey of
State Prison Inmates and the 1989 Survey of Jail
Inmates.  

The findings show that females experienced more
than 10 times as many incidents of violence
committed by an intimate than did males -- 572,000
versus 49,000.

NCVS Redesign
2pp, 10/94
This fact sheet summarizes the redesign program. 
The NCVS, which counts incidents both reported and
not reported to the police, relies on victims'
accounts to provide a detailed picture of crime
incidents and trends.  Data are collected
throughout the year from a sample of about 50,000
households with more than 100,000 persons age 12
or over.  The redesign includes new questions and
improves the technology and survey methods used in
the questionnaire.  Survey changes substantially
increase the number of rapes and aggravated and
simple assaults reported to interviewers.  For the
first time, NCVS measures non-rape sexual assault
and unwanted or coerced sexual contact involving a
threat or attempt to harm.

NCJ 151171

This document reports 20 years of highlights from
the NCVS, the second largest Federal household
survey.  The 1967 President's Commission on Law
Enforcement and Administration of Justice found: 
"one of the most neglected subjects in the study
of crime is its victims. . ." As a result of the
commission's work, the Department of Justice began
the survey in 1973.  Since then more than 4.4
million interviews have been conducted.  This
report contains many findings that the 1967
commission called for, including those on
unreported crime, crime trends, crime victim
characteristics, relationship between victim and
offender, and interracial crime.  Presented in a

Child Victimizers:  Violent Offenders and Their
Victims 
28pp, 3/96, 20 tables, 10 figures; Lawrence A.
Greenfeld, BJS 
Addressing the mandate of the National Child
Protection Act of 1994, which called for a study
of offenders who committed crimes against
children, this study found --
* 1 in 5 violent State prisoners (about 61,000
offenders) reported a victim under age 18 
* older violent inmates were substantially more
likely than younger inmates to have victimized a
child
* inmates reported that when a child under age 12
was the victim of violence, in nearly 8 out of 10
cases the offender reported that the victim had
been raped or sexually assaulted.
The study uses data from the 1991 BJS Survey of
State Prison Inmates and the FBI's 1992
Supplementary Homicide Report, which includes data
on child murder victims (nearly 3,000 in 1992) and
offenders who murdered children.  The 1991 inmate
survey is based on personal hour-long interviews
with a nationally representative sample of 14,000
prisoners in about 300 State prisons.  The report
describes the sociodemographic data on these
offenders, the physical or sexual abuse they may
have experienced, their current offense, their
criminal history backgrounds (including prior
offenses against children), and their use of drugs
or alcohol at the time of the offense.  For child
victims of adult offenders, the study includes
their sociodemographic backgrounds, the
victim-offender relationship, and the consequences
to the victim, such as injuries and weapon use by
the offender.

National Data Collection on Police Use of Force
100pp, 8/96; Institute for Law and Justice, BJS
award  #OJP-94-C-008.
This discussion paper,  published jointly with the
National Institute of Justice, summarizes prior
research on  police use of force and lists the
difficulties inherent in collecting use-of-force
data, including definitional problems, reluctance
of police agencies to provide reliable data,
concerns about the misapplication of reported
data, and the degree of detail needed on
individual incidents.  It also discusses
alternative approaches to data collection and
sources of data, including official records,
surveys of police, and surveys of citizens.  The
paper concludes that it will be some time before a
national reporting program is implemented. In the
meantime two pilot programs are collecting data on
use of force: an expansion of the BJS National
Crime Victimization Survey to include questions
about use of force and a grant to the
International Association of Chiefs of Police for
the first phase of a four-phase program to
establish a national database to collect incident
reports on use of force from police departments.

Prosecutors in State Courts, 1994
8pp, 9/96, 10 tables; Carol J. DeFrances, Steven
K. Smith, Louise van der Does, BJS 
This Bulletin presents findings from the 1994
National Survey of Prosecutors, the most recent in
a series of biennial sample surveys of State court
prosecutors.  Data from the survey include the
number of employees, annual office budget for
prosecutorial functions, size of total office
staff, number of felony cases closed, and number
of felony convictions.  New topic areas covered in
this report include juvenile cases waived to
criminal court, the cross designation of
prosecutors to litigate in Federal court,
procedures for handling civil actions against
prosecutors and other professional staff, and
types of community involvement by prosecutors.

K. Smith, BJS 
This BJS Bulletin presents findings from the 1992
National Prosecutor Survey Program, a series of
biennial sample surveys of State court
prosecutors.  Data from the survey include the
number of employees, median annual office budget
for prosecution, median size of total office
staff, median number of felony cases closed,
average cost to taxpayers per felony case, and
median number of felony convictions.  The report
also includes data on use of innovative
prosecution techniques, intermediate sanctions,
plea bargaining, and work-related assaults and
threats.  Personal protective efforts are also
addressed; for example, in 27% of prosecutors'
offices, at least one prosecuting attorney carried
a firearm for protection.

Prosecuting Criminal Enterprises:  Federal
Offenses and Offenders
7pp, 11/93, 11 tables; Kenneth Carlson, Peter
Finn, Abt Associates Inc., BJS award
#91-BJ-CX-K025
This report focuses on prosecutions under the
Federal racketeering and continuing criminal
enterprise statutes.  It is part of the series of
BJS Special Reports describing activity in the
Federal criminal justice system, Data describe the
number of persons prosecuted and compare rates of
prosecution, conviction, and incarceration for
offenders tried under these statutes with rates
for offenders who committed similar offenses but
were tried under other Federal criminal statutes.

Local Prosecution of Organized Crime:  The Use of
State RICO Statutes
30pp, 10/93, 1 table, 3 figures; Donald J.
Rebovich, Kenneth R. Coyle, John C. Schaaf,
American Prosecutors Research Institute, BJS award
#91-BJ-CXK-034
This BJS Discussion Paper combines the
quantitative results of a mail survey sent to
local prosecutors with the qualitative results of
a followup telephone interview.  After giving a
brief history of Federal and State
Racketeer-Influenced and Corrupt Organization
(RICO) legislation,  the paper discusses how
widely local prosecutors use RICO, why some
prosecutors do not use the statute, and what can
be done to improve the State RICO laws.  Although
other studies have been done on Federal and State
civil RICO prosecutions, this is the first study
of RICO use in criminal cases at the local level.

Comparing Case Processing Statistics   
2pp, 8/96, 1 table; jointly published by BJS and 4
other Federal agencies; John Scalia, BJS 
This joint statement of five Federal criminal
justice agencies identifies the primary
differences in case processing statistics reported
by the agencies and explains why the reported
statistics are not directly comparable.  The five
agencies are the Administrative Office of the U.S.
Courts, the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the
Executive Office for the U.S. Attorneys, the
Federal Bureau of Prisons, and the U.S. Sentencing
Commission.  By examining issues central to the
collection and reporting of Federal criminal
justice statistics -- defendants processed,
offenses committed, and disposition and sentence
imposed -- this statement clarifies differences in
emphasis, definition, and classification.  As part
of an ongoing effort to reconcile the case
processing statistics reported by each agency, the
agencies plan to develop selected statistics that
observe uniform reporting standards.  In addition,
as part of its Federal Justice Statistics Program,
BJS will continue to publish the Compendium of
Federal Justice Statistics, which describes all
stages of the Federal criminal justice system.

Noncitizens in the Federal Criminal Justice  
System: Federal Justice Statistics Program
11pp, 8/96, 14 tables, 2 figures; John Scalia, BJS
This Special Report describes noncitizens
processed in the Federal justice system, including
the number prosecuted and incarcerated from 1984
to 1994, the offenses for which they were
prosecuted, and the sanctions imposed.  The number
of noncitizens prosecuted in U.S. district courts
tripled, from 3,462 during 1984 to 10,352 during
1994.  In 1994, 45% of noncitizens prosecuted in
U.S. district courts were charged with a drug
offense.  More than 50% of the noncitizens
prosecuted in U.S. district courts were prosecuted
in the Federal judicial districts near the
Southwest border.  Information describing classes
of noncitizens, the processing of illegal aliens,
and Federal grants to States to help defray the
costs of incarcerating illegal aliens is also
presented.

Felony Sentences in the United States, 1992
11pp, 5/96, 7 tables, 1 figure; Patrick A. Langan,
Jan M. Chaiken, Ph.D., BJS
The latest available figures covering both State
and Federal sentencing reveal that in 1992, the
Nation's courts convicted about 168,000 adults of
a violent felony:  an estimated 165,000 in State
courts and less than 3,000 in Federal courts. 
Federal courts accounted for about 2% of all
violent felony convictions in the Nation.  In
1992, convictions for violent, property, drug and
other felonies totaled 41,673 in Federal courts
and 893,630 in State courts, or 1,103,161
altogether.  Federal courts accounted for 3.8% of
the national total.

This report presents detailed findings from the
1992 nationally representative sample survey of
felons convicted in State courts in 300 counties. 
It includes tables on the number of felony
offenders in State courts, the sentences they
received, demographic characteristics of convicted
felons, the number of felons sentenced to
probation, the number of felons convicted by trial
and guilty plea, the amount of time required to
process felony conviction cases, regional
variation in adjudication and sentencing, and
trends in drug trafficking from 1986 to 1992.

Indigent Defense
4pp, 2/96, 8 tables; Steven K. Smith, Carol J.
DeFrances, BJS
This report presents selected findings drawn from
various BJS surveys containing information related
to the indigent defense for criminal defendants. 
Twenty-eight percent of State court prosecutors
reported in 1992 that their jurisdiction used
public defender programs exclusively to provide
indigent counsel.  In 1990, State and local
governments spent approximately $1.3 billion on
public defender services.  In 1979, this figure
was about $300 million.  In constant 1990 dollars,
State and local expenditures doubled for public
defense from 1979 to 1990.  About three-fourths of
the inmates in State prisons and about half of
those in Federal prisons in 1991 received publicly
provided legal counsel for the offense for which
they were serving time.

Contract Cases in Large Counties: Civil Justice
Survey of State Courts, 1992
10pp, 2/96, 12 tables; Steven K. Smith, Carol J.
DeFrances, Patrick A. Langan, BJS
This Special Report presents 1992 data on
disposition of 366,000 contract cases involving
1.3 million litigants in State general
jurisdiction courts in the Nation's 75 largest
counties. The most frequent type of contract
dispute involved the plaintiff as a seller seeking
payment owed by a buyer or borrower.  About half
the contract cases were resolved through an agreed
settlement.  Less than 3% of the cases were
disposed by a jury or bench trial.  Businesses
made up two-thirds of the plaintiffs in contract
cases; individuals, about a quarter.  Contract
case defendants were most often businesses,
followed by individuals. Almost two-thirds of the
contract cases were disposed within 1 year of
filing.

Spouse Murder Defendants in Large Urban Counties 
26pp, 10/95, 30 tables; Patrick A. Langan, John M.
Dawson, BJS 
Approximately 1 in 3 spouse murder cases disposed
in 1988 in the Nation's 75 largest urban counties
were sampled.  More than half of the Nation's
murders occurred in these 75 largest counties.  Of
the spouse murders sampled, 59% were husbands
killing wives, and 41% were wives killing
husbands.  This report discusses how State
prosecutors, judges, and juries handled these two
types of murder cases and gives specific case
histories, describing each case and its outcome in
court.

This discussion paper examines a sample of
disposed habeas corpus cases (through which State
prisoners make petitions to challenge the validity
of their convictions or sentences) in 18 Federal
district courts in 9 selected States (Alabama,
California, Florida, Indiana, Louisiana, Missouri,
New York, Pennsylvania, and Texas).  The covered
States made up about half of the Nation's 10,000
petitions filed each year in Federal courts.  The
study presents case characteristics, issues
litigated, processing time, and outcomes.

Smith, BJS
Using data collected from a representative sample
of felony cases filed in the Nation's 75 largest
counties during May 1992, this report presents a
complete description of the processing of felony
defendants, including demographic characteristics,
prior arrests and convictions, current arrest
charges, criminal justice status at the time of
the offense, type of pretrial release or
detention, bail amount, court appearance record,
adjudication outcome, and sentence received if
convicted.

Violent Offenders in State Prison:  Sentences and
Time Served -- State Inmates, 1992-94   
10pp, 7/95; Lawrence A. Greenfeld, BJS 
For the first time BJS reports jurisdiction-level
data on sentence length and time served for
violent prison inmates who were admitted or
released in 1992, 1993, and 1994.  Using
guidelines developed in the BJS National
Corrections Reporting Program, 49 States and the
District of Columbia provided data on new court
commitments and first releases of violent
offenders, including the number, the average
sentence length, the projected minimum time to be
served before release for admissions, and the time
served in prison and jail for releases. (Violent
offenders are those convicted of homicide,
kidnaping, forcible rape, sexual assault, robbery,
assault, or other crimes involving the threat or
imposition of harm upon the victim, including
extortion, intimidation, reckless endangerment,
hit-and-run driving with injury, or child abuse.) 
Jurisdictional variations and trends are
highlighted.

Federal Firearms-Related Offenses:  Federal
Offenses and Offenders
2pp, 7/95, 2 tables, 1 figure; Abt Associates
Inc., BJS award #91-BJ-CX-K025
The data brief notes the association between
firearms involvement and an increased severity of
sentence as well as a more extensive criminal
history for Federal prisoners. The number of
offenders sentenced to Federal prison grew 175%
from 1982 to 1992. In the 12 months before
September 30, 1993, firearms were involved in
sentences of almost 7,000 offenders, about a sixth
of those sentenced under Federal guidelines.

DeFrances, Steven K. Smith, Patrick A. Langan,
BJS, and Brian J. Ostrom, David B. Rottman, John
A. Goerdt, National Center for State Courts
Juries in the 75 largest counties disposed of
12,000 tort, contract, and real property rights
cases during a 12-month period ending June 30,
1992.  Jury cases were 2% of the 762,000 tort,
contract and real property cases disposed by State
courts of general jurisdiction in the Nation's
most populous counties.  Thirty-three percent of
cases decided by juries were automobile accident
suits, 11% were medical malpractice, and 5% were
product liability and toxic substance cases.  In
half of all jury cases, the jury found in favor of
the plaintiff and in the 12-month period awarded
an estimated $2.7 billion in compensatory and
punitive damages.  The median total award for a
plaintiff was $52,000.  Punitive damages were
awarded in 6% of the jury cases with a plaintiff
winner.  The median punitive award was $50,000;
average time from complaint filing to jury verdict
was 2.5 years.

9pp, 4/95, 9 tables, 1 figure; Steven K. Smith,
Carol J. DeFrances, Patrick  A. Langan, BJS, and
John Goerdt, National Center for State Courts
Three out of four tort cases filed in the Nation's
75 most populous counties never reached the
courtroom because they were settled out of court. 
Only 3% went to trial, with the plaintiff winning
about half the time.  The study of an estimated
378,000 State tort cases (about half of all tort
suits completed from July 1, 1991, through June
30, 1992) found that more than 75% involved
automobile accidents or property liability claims. 
Medical malpractice, product liability, and toxic
substance cases accounted for 10%. Half the tort
cases were disposed within 14 months, and auto
tort cases were settled in a shorter period than
all other cases.  Half of all tort cases involved
three or more litigants. Torts are wrongful acts
-- not including contract disputes -- that result
in injury to another's person, property, or
reputation and for which the injured party is
entitled to compensation.  This study is based on
a representative sample of the 75 courts where
nearly half of all tort cases nationwide are
handled, making this the closest that exists to a
national tort study.

NCJ 153858 
Prison Sentences and Time Served for Violence
3pp, 4/95, 7 tables; Lawrence A. Greenfeld, BJS 
Violent offenders released from State prisons in
1992 served 48% of the sentence they had received
-- an average of 43 months in confinement, both
jail and prison, on an average sentence of 89
months.  The finding that just under half the
sentence will be served in confinement was
confirmed through analysis of self-reports of
expected discharge dates from the 1991 BJS
National Survey of State Prison Inmates.  Prison
release practices for violent offenders in 31
States reveal wide disparity across the States in
sentence length but substantially less disparity
and greater consensus on the duration of time
spent in confinement. The findings are from BJS
data collection programs, including the annual
National Corrections Reporting Program (NCRP) and
the 1991 sample survey of State prisoners. The
report also estimates the hypothetical impact on
time served of changing the percentage of sentence
served and discusses how the States differ in
percentage of sentence served.

Challenging the Conditions of Prisons and Jails: 
A Report on Section 1983 Litigation 
44pp, 2/95, 10 tables, 2 figures; Roger A. Hanson,
Henry W.K. Daley, National Center for State
Courts, BJS award #92-BJ-CX-K026
This discussion paper furnishes systematic data on
litigation under Section 1983 of the U.S. Code,
which the U.S. Supreme Court has interpreted to
permit prisoners to sue correctional officials in
Federal court when the conditions of confinement
fail to meet constitutional standards.  Section
1983 litigation represents 1 in 10 of the civil
cases filed in U.S. district courts.  This profile
of such lawsuits examining more than 2,700 cases
disposed of in 1992 in 9 States (Alabama,
California, Florida, Indiana, Louisiana, Missouri,
New York, Pennsylvania, and Texas) shows that 95%
of cases result in dismissals, 4% result in
stipulated dismissals or settlements, and 2%
result in trial verdicts (of these, less than 1/2
of 1% result in a favorable verdict for the
prisoner).  Half the cases last 6 months or less
because they fail to meet Section 1983
requirements.  In cases lasting 6 to 12 months,
the percent of issues the court dismissed
decreases, with a corresponding increase in
stipulated dismissals and successful defendants'
motions to dismiss, a relative decrease in cases
challenging convictions and sentences, and an
increase in the relative number of cases
concerning inadequate medical treatment, lack of
due process, and denial of access to the courts. 
In cases surviving up to 2 years, issues of
physical security become more frequent; the cases
are more likely to have appointed counsel and
evidentiary hearings; and successful prisoner
litigation becomes more likely, with both
settlements and verdicts resulting in financial
awards to prisoners.  The authors, Hanson and
Daley, state that (1) cases that lack an adequate
basis in law or fact should be resolved through
State administrative grievance procedures instead
of through litigation in the U.S. courts, and (2)
under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized
Persons Act of 1980, intended to resolve
prisoners' grievances through State administrative
procedures, the U.S. Attorney General and the
Federal courts can certify grievance procedures
and then require their exhaustion as a way of
resolving inmate grievances short of litigation.

peremptory jury challenges, jury verdict rules)
* appellate courts (case selection, expedited
procedures)
* governance of court systems (budgets,
administration)
* judges and judicial selection (numbers of
judges, mandatory judicial education)
* processing of criminal cases (felony definition,
mandatory minimum, habitual offender sentencing
provisions).

Felony Sentences in State Courts, 1992
11pp, 1/95, 12 tables; Patrick A. Langan, Helen A.
Graziadei, BJS
This nationally representative survey of 300
counties found that in 1992 about 171,000 men and
women were convicted in State felony courts of
trafficking in illegal drugs, over twice as many
as in 1986, accounting for 30% of the increase in
felony convictions nationwide from 1986 to 1992. 
About 48% of the 1992 convicted traffickers were
sent to a State prison versus 37% in 1986.  The
total number of State felony convictions increased
53% from 1986 to 1992.  Urban counties with
populations over 600,000 had felony convictions up
71% and drug trafficking convictions up 116%.

The latest available figures covering both State
and Federal sentencing reveal that, in 1990, the
Nation's courts convicted about 150,000 adults of
a violent felony.  An estimated 148,000 of the
150,000 occurred in State courts.  The remaining
approximately 2,000 were in Federal courts. 
Federal courts accounted for about 1% of all
violent felony convictions in the Nation.  In
1990, convictions for violent, property, drug and
other felonies totaled 36,684 in Federal courts
and 829,344 in State courts, or 866,028
altogether.  Federal courts accounted for 4.2% of

Langan, BJS
This BJS Special Report, a survey of murder cases
disposed in 1988 in the courts of large urban
counties, found that 16% of murder victims were
members of the defendant's family:  6.5% were
killed by their spouses, 3.5% by their parents,
1.9% by their own children, 1.5% by their
siblings, and 2.6% by other relatives.  Women were
45% of the victims in murders involving family
members but 18% of victims in other murders. 
Among family murder defendants, 35% were female
versus 7% among nonfamily defendants.  Women were
over half of the defendants (55%) in only one
category of family murder:  parents killing their
offspring.  Firearms were used in 42% of family
murders, compared to 63% of nonfamily murders.

Felony Sentencing and Jail Characteristics
24pp, 6/93, 6 tables, 2 figures; John M. Dawson,
BJS
This BJS discussion paper explores the possible
impact of jail conditions on the likelihood that a
convicted felon will be sentenced to a county jail
rather than a State prison.  For this study, the
BJS data collection on felony sentencing in 1988
was merged with the data from the 1988 jail
census.  The data suggest that certain programs
such as work release may influence judges to
sentence nonviolent felons to jail rather than to
prison or probation.

This BJS Special Report represents almost 10,000
prosecuted murder defendants and more than 8,000
murder victims in the Nation's 75 most populous
counties in 1988 -- about half of the Nation's
murder arrestees for that year and just under half
of the murder victims.  The study, which
summarizes the circumstances of the murders, found
that 80% of the murder victims knew their killers,
16% were related to their killers, and 52% had a
romantic or social relationship with their
murderers.  About a third of the female victims
and a tenth of the male victims were killed by a
spouse or romantic partner.  About three-quarters
of the victims were male, just over half were
black, and nearly half were ages 15 to 29.

Felony Sentences in State Courts, 1990
16pp, 3/93, 26 tables; Patrick A. Langan, John M.
Dawson, BJS
This nationally representative survey of 300
counties found that about 168,000 men and women
were convicted in State felony courts in 1990 of
trafficking in illegal drugs, more than twice the
number convicted in 1986.  The traffickers
accounted for 37% of the increase in felony
convictions nationwide.  About 49% of the
convicted traffickers were sent to a State prison
versus 37% in 1986.  The number of State felony
convictions increased 42% from 1986 to 1990. 
During the same period, urban counties with
populations over 600,000 had felony convictions up
61% and drug trafficking convictions up 128%. 
This BJS Bulletin presents convictions for 10
other offense categories as well as the sex, race,
and age of convicted felons.

This report announces that there were almost 1.6
million men and women in the Nation's jails and
prisons in 1995.  State and Federal prisons, which
primarily house convicted felons serving sentences
of more than a year, held about two-thirds of the
incarcerated population (1,078,357 inmates) at the
end of 1995.  The other third were confined in
locally operated jails, which normally hold people
awaiting trial or serving sentences of a year or
less.  On June 3, 1995, the most recent date for
which jail data are available, 507,044 people were
in local jails and another 34,869 were being
supervised by jail authorities in programs such as
electronic monitoring, house detention, community
service, or work release.  For the first time, the
Bulletin provides the number of inmates who were
under jail supervision but not confined.  Trends
in the total number of persons incarcerated and
the rate per 100,000 adults are also presented. 
Both jail and prison inmate data are collected and

In 1991, State and Federal prison authorities
reported that 2.2% of 792,176 inmates were
infected with the human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) that causes AIDS.  This BJS Special Report
describes prison and jail policies for testing
inmates for HIV, the numbers of prison inmates
infected with HIV, and the numbers of deaths of
inmates from AIDS in prisons and jails.  Of the
total inmate population, 0.6% exhibited symptoms
of HIV infection, including 0.2% with confirmed
AIDS.  All prison jurisdictions reported testing
some inmates for HIV; 17 tested all prisoners. 
Among tested inmates reporting results to
interviewers, 0.8% who had never used drugs were
positive, compared to 2.5% of drug users, 4.9% of
injectable drug users, and 7.1% who had shared
needles.  In 1991 over a fourth of all inmate
deaths were attributed to AIDS.  Data sources

10pp, 8/93, 19 tables, 2 figures; Allen J. Beck,
Thomas P. Bonczar, Darrell K. Gilliard, BJS
This annual BJS Bulletin reported that at
mid-1992, local jails held nearly 445,000 inmates,
or about 1 in every 428 adult U.S. residents.  The
largest jail jurisdictions held 81% of the total
inmate population.  From these jurisdictions, the
Annual Survey of Jails for the first time in its
history collected information about drug testing,
about programs that treat or educate inmates, and
about boot camps, work release, and alternatives
to incarceration such as electronic monitoring,
house arrest, community service, and weekend or
day reporting.

Provides an overview of the firearm check
procedures in each of the States, summarizing the
initial responses provided by 40 States and verbal
discussions with the nonresponding States.  It is
a prelude to ongoing data collection efforts that
will focus on the number of applications received,
the number rejected, the reason(s) for the
rejection, and other processing information
associated with each application to purchase a
firearm.  This is the first report to be published
from the BJS Firearm Inquiry Statistics (FIST)
project, which is part of the BJS National
Criminal History Improvement Program (NCHIP).  The
project is being conducted by the Regional Justice
Information Service (REJIS) of St. Louis,
Missouri.  The purpose of the project is to
develop statistics that describe the
implementation of the Brady Handgun Violence
Prevention Act (Brady Act).  It is anticipated
that data will be obtained from more than 500
state and local CLEOs (Chief Law Enforcement
Officers, i.e., any agency designated as
authorized to perform criminal record checks for
handgun purchases under the Brady Act or, in the
case of Brady Alternative States, under its own
legislation).  Data will be used for national
