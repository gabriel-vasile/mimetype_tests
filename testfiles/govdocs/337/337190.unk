Firearm Injury from Crime:  
Firearms, Crime, and Criminal Justice
7pp, 4/96, 6 tables, 2 figures; Marianne W.
Zawitz, BJS
This document reports available statistical
information  from a number of sources on fatal and
nonfatal firearm injury that results from crime. 
Findings include--
* About 3% of the victims of nonfatal gun crime
suffered 
gunshot wounds.
* An estimated 57,500 nonfatal gunshot wounds from
assaults were treated in hospital emergency
departments from June 1992 through May 1993.  Over
half of these victims were black males; a quarter
were black males age 15-24.
* The firearm injury rate for police officers
declined in the early 1980's and began climbing
again after 1987, but has not exceeded the peak
reached in 1980-81.
Data presented in the report are from several
sources 
including the BJS National Crime Victimization
Survey,  the FBI's Supplemental Homicide Reports,
and the Firearms Injury Surveillance Study
sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.  Included are descriptions of the
characteristics of the victims and the
circumstances surrounding the crime.  Data about

Future Directions for the National Archive 
of Criminal Justice Data:  Report 
of the Task Force, 1995
15pp, 8/95
The Bureau of Justice Statistics is developing a
comprehensive strategy to address its data
dissemination needs for the immediate future. 
Part of this planning focuses on the National
Archive of Criminal Justice Data (NACJD), which
distributes public-use data files for BJS.  New
capabilities that enhance data access, retrieval,
and dissemination capabilities are becoming
available.  BJS wishes to investigate how these
technologies might be utilized to improve the
services it provides to users of criminal justice
data.  To this end, BJS empaneled a Task Force to
provide an independent view of its efforts to
disseminate data.  The Task Force provided
comments on how NACJD maintains and disseminates
data, processes public use files, selects its
holdings, and provides user services.  In addition
to these findings, this report provides background
on the formation of the Task Force, meeting
summaries, and a list of participants.

NCJ 148201 
Guns Used In Crime:  
Firearms, Crime, and Criminal Justice--
Selected Findings 
7pp, 7/95, 7 tables, 1 figure; 
Marianne W. Zawitz, BJS
Since there is no national collection of data
about the guns used by criminals, this report
provides information from several sources,
including the FBI National Crime Information
Center's stolen gun file, the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco, and Firearms National Tracing Center, the
BJS National Crime Victimization Survey, the FBI
Uniform Crime Reports, the BJS Survey of Inmates
in State Correctional Facilities, other inmate
surveys, and special studies of homicides
involving guns.  The report covers how often guns
are used in crime, what categories of firearms are
most often used, and what type of guns criminals
prefer. This is the first of a series of reports
on firearms and crime that will be part of a
comprehensive report entitled Firearms, Crime, and
Criminal Justice.  Includes bibliography.

NCJ 145318

CRIMES AND VICTIMS

NCJ 165811
Perceptions of Neighborhood Crime, 1995
Forthcoming, Carol J. DeFrances and Steven K.
Smith, BJS
This report presents data from the American
Housing Survey and the NCVS to examine
neighborhood crime perceptions and corresponding
rates of criminal victimization for the Nation's
households.  The results show that perceptions of
neighborhood crime vary by race, residential
location, housing tenure and type of housing
structure and generally reflect actual crime
victimizations as recorded by NCVS.

NCJ 165477
Economic Costs of Crime To Victims, 1995
Forthcoming; Patsy A. Klaus, BJS
Presents 1995 data from the redesigned National
Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) concerning
direct economic costs to victims of the crimes of
rape/sexual assault, robbery, aggravated and
simple assault, purse snatching/pocket picking,
household burglary, property theft and motor
vehicle theft.  These costs include loss from
property theft or damage, cash losses, medical
expenses, and amount of pay lost because of injury
or activities related to the crime. Data are
provided on the percentage of crimes in which
property was recovered, the percentage of victims
who had health insurance or public assistance for
paying medical costs and the percentage of victims
who lost time from work as a result of the crime.
This report is the first that uses the redesigned
NCVS to estimate economic costs to victims.  

NCJ 162031
Age Patterns of Victims of Serious 
Violent Crimes
9pp, forthcoming; Craig A. Perkins, BJS
This Special Report presents data from the
redesigned NCVS that examines violent crime across
the general population, ages 12 or older.  It
compares teenagers and young adults to older
persons and presents the high victimization rates
of young people in the United States.  The report
emphasizes graphical presentations for
victimization data about the violent crimes of
rape, robbery, and aggravated assault (from the
NCVS) and homicide (from crimes reported to
police).  Differences in levels of violence by
race and sex are explored.  The report covers 1992
through 1994.

NCJ 164508
Sex Differences in Violent Victimization
18pp, forthcoming, 10 tables, 1 figure; Diane
Craven, Ph.D., BJS
Uses 1994 data from the NCVS to examine
similarities and differences in the magnitude and
pattern of violent victimization characterized by
the sex of the victim.  Sections of the report
contain detailed information about specific
violent crime types and contextual characteristics
of violence against both women and men and their
relationship to those who victimize them.  Data
include series crimes, multiple-offender versus
lone-offender crimes, demographics, crime
reporting behavior, injuries, and weapon use.  A
methodology section is provided.

NCJ 156921
Violence-Related Injuries Treated 
in Hospital Emergency Departments
9pp, 8/97; Michael R. Rand, BJS
Presents findings from a study of violence related
injuries treated in hospital emergency departments
in 1994.  The study was conducted using the
Consumer Product Safety Commission's National
Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS)
program.  Existing estimates of
difficult-to-measure violence such as domestic
violence vary greatly, mostly because of
differences in data collection methods and lack of
consensus on the behaviors defining the violence
being measured.  In an effort to improve estimates
of serious violence, including domestic violence
and sexual assault, BJS implemented this study to
collect data on violence related injuries. 
Conducted at a sample of the Nation's hospitals to
estimate product-related injuries, NEISS was
modified to obtain data on characteristics of
persons treated for intentionally inflicted
injuries, characteristics of those causing the
injury and circumstances of injury incidents.  The
study found that 1.4 million persons were treated
in hospital emergency departments in 1994 for
injuries inflicted in confirmed or suspected
interpersonal violence.  Of these, 243,000 were
inflicted by someone with whom the victim had an
intimate relationship (spouse, ex-spouse, or
current or former boyfriend or girlfriend), an
estimate 4 times higher than the equivalent
estimate from the National Crime Victimization
Survey.  

NCJ 162126
Criminal Victimization in the United States, 1994
150pp, 6/97, 118 tables, table index
Reports final 1994 data for the NCVS, presenting
the major variables measured in the survey in 118
detailed data tables covering crimes of violence
(rape, sexual assault, robbery, assault)  and
theft (pocket picking, purse snatching, burglary,
theft, and motor vehicle theft).  The BJS Internet
site (http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/) has tables
from the report, covering victim characteristics
(sex, age, race, ethnicity, marital status,
education, income, and residence); crime
characteristics (time and place of occurrence,
distance from home, weapon use, self-protection,
injury, medical care, economic loss, and time lost
from work); victim-offender relationship;
substance use by offenders; offender
characteristics (age, race, and sex); whether
crimes were reported to police; reasons for
reporting or not; and police response time for
reported crime.  

NCJ 163069
Criminal Victimization, 1973-95
8pp, 5/97, 1 table, 8 figures; Michael R. Rand,
BJS; 
James P. Lynch, American University; David Cantor,
Westat
Presents trend data for 1973-95 from the NCVS,
including data collected both before and after a
substantial methodological redesign that was
implemented in 1992.  Data collected prior to 1992
have been adjusted for this report to take into
account methodological improvements introduced in
the survey redesign.  The report describes the
overall trends for the NCVS-measured crimes of
rape, robbery, aggravated and simple assault,
household burglary, theft and motor vehicle theft,
as well as for homicide as measured by the FBI's
Uniform Crime Reports.  It includes a description
of the method used to adjust the NCVS data
collected before 1992 as well as the underlying
assumptions and limitations of the adjustment
method. 

NCJ 164381
Effects of the Redesign on Victimization Estimates
7pp, 5/97, 3 tables, 1 figure; Charles R.
Kindermann, BJS; 
James P. Lynch, American University; David Cantor,
Westat
Compares the effect on victimization rates of old
and new methodology used in the NCVS, a major
source of national statistics on crimes and
victims.  In the mid-1970's the National Academy
of Sciences reviewed the NCVS and identified
possible improvements in survey methodology and
scope. BJS then sponsored a research consortium
with several agencies, including the Bureau of the
Census, to investigate the issues raised and began
a collaborative survey redesign effort in the late
1970's to improve the survey's accuracy and
utility. From January 1992 through June 1993 half
the sample was surveyed with the new method and
half with the old to measure the effect on
victimization rates.       

NCJ 162032
Changes in Criminal Victimization 1994-95    
12pp, 4/97, 15 tables, 1 figure; Bruce A. Taylor,
BJS
This BJS Bulletin replaces Criminal Victimization
1995.  It presents the 1995 findings from the
NCVS, an ongoing survey of households that each
year interviews about 100,000 persons in 50,000
households.  Violent crimes included in the report
are rape/sexual assault, robbery, and both
aggravated and simple assault (from the NCVS), and
homicide (from crimes reported to the police). 
Property crimes include burglaries, motor vehicle
thefts, and thefts of other property.  This report
also summarizes other findings, including the
characteristics of victims, and compares 1995
victimization rates and those of earlier years,
primarily 1994. The findings are based on a
redesigned NCVS that was phased in beginning in
1992.

NCJ 162602 
Female Victims of Violent Crime:  
Selected Findings
4pp, 12/96; Diane Craven, BJS
Includes 1992-94 data for rape/sexual assault,
robbery, and assault from the redesigned NCVS,
victimization trend data for 1973-94 adjusted for
the redesign, and homicide data from the 1994 FBI
Uniform Crime Reports. Summarizes  recently
published data on both fatal and nonfatal violence
between intimates (present or former husband,
wife, boyfriend, or girlfriend) as opposed to
relatives, friends/acquaintances, and strangers.
Highlights include:
* In 1994, women were about two-thirds as likely
as men to be victims of violence; 20 years ago,
they were half as likely.
* In 1994 females represented 21% of all known
homicide victims in the United States.
* Males killed 9 out of 10 female murder victims.

NCJ 161405
Domestic and Sexual Violence Data Collection:  
A Report to Congress under the Violence 
Against Women Act
84pp, 7/96, 3 tables; Justice Research and
Statistics Association, NIJ award  #95-IJ-CX-0010
This Research Report, supported by the National
Institute of Justice and the Bureau of Justice
Statistics, examines how States and the Federal
Government collect data on the incidence of sexual
and domestic violence.  The report identifies ways
that States could centralize data collection and
examines problems of Federal statistical
recordkeeping for domestic violence-related
criminal complaints.  A panel of experts on
domestic and sexual violence and a survey of the
States provided information.  The most significant
finding was that the Federal Government and a
majority of States (35 for domestic violence, 30
for sexual violence) gather annual statistics on
these crimes, although issues of accuracy and
completeness of coverage were identified. 
Improving reporting and obtaining more
comprehensive statistics will require both
organizational and technical coordination and
cooperation at all levels of government.  As
mandated by Congress in the Violence Against Women
Act of 1994, the report represents an important
first step in analyzing what needs to be done to
ensure collection of reliable statistics on the
extent and nature of violent crimes committed
against women.

Criminal Victimization 1994
6pp, 4/96, 8 tables; Craig A. Perkins, Patsy A.
Klaus, BJS 
This annual BJS Bulletin presents the first 1994
findings from the National Crime Victimization
Survey (NCVS), based on an ongoing survey of
households, each year interviewing about 100,000
persons in 50,000 households.  In 1994, U.S.
residents age 12 or older experienced more than 42
million crimes:  about 11 million violent
victimizations and 31 million property crimes.
Violent crimes included in the report are
rape/sexual assault, robbery, and both aggravated
and simple assault (from the NCVS), and homicide
(from crimes reported to police).  Property crimes
include burglaries, motor vehicle thefts, and
thefts of other property.  This report also
summarizes other findings, including the extent to
which crimes are reported to the police, the
characteristics of victims, and comparisons
between 1993 and 1994 victimization rates and
levels.  Both 1993 and 1994 findings are based on
the redesigned survey that was phased into the
sample beginning in 1992.

and Linda E. Saltzman, Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention
This BJS Special Report is the first release of
the 1992-93 estimates of violence against women
after an extended effort to improve the
victimization survey's ability to measure violence
against women. The survey now asks more explicit
and direct questions about sexual assaults and
other victimizations perpetrated by known
offenders. Data include the annual number of
violent victimizations, rapes, and sexual assaults
against women; the number perpetrated by intimates
(including husbands, ex-husbands, boyfriends, and
ex-boyfriends); rates for violence by intimates
for women versus rates for men; rates for violence
and sexual assaults by strangers; age and family
income of female victims of violence; and rates of
injury.

NCVS Redesign
2pp, 10/94
This fact sheet summarizes the redesign program. 
The NCVS, which counts incidents both reported and
not reported to the police, relies on victims'
accounts to provide a detailed picture of crime
incidents and trends.  Data are collected
throughout the year from a sample of about 50,000
households with more than 100,000 persons age 12
or over.  The redesign includes new questions and
improves the technology and survey methods used in
the questionnaire.  Survey changes substantially
increase the number of rapes and aggravated and
simple assaults reported to interviewers.  For the
first time, NCVS measures non-rape sexual assault
and unwanted or coerced sexual contact involving a
threat or attempt to harm.

28pp, 3/96, 20 tables, 10 figures; Lawrence A.
Greenfeld, BJS 
Addressing the mandate of the National Child
Protection Act of 1994, which called for a study
of offenders who committed crimes against
children, this study found--
* 1 in 5 violent State prisoners (about 61,000
offenders) reported a victim under age 18 
* older violent inmates were substantially more
likely than younger inmates to have victimized a
child
* inmates reported that when a child under age 12
was the victim of violence, in nearly 8 out of 10
cases the offender reported that the victim had
been raped or sexually assaulted.
The study uses data from the 1991 BJS Survey of
State Prison Inmates and the FBI's 1992
Supplementary Homicide Report, which includes data
on child murder victims (nearly 3,000 in 1992) and
offenders who murdered children.  The 1991 inmate
survey is based on personal hour-long interviews
with a nationally representative sample of 14,000
prisoners in about 300 State prisons.  The report
describes the sociodemographic data on these
offenders, the physical or sexual abuse they may
have experienced, their current offense, their
criminal history backgrounds (including prior
offenses against children), and their use of drugs
or alcohol at the time of the offense.  For child
victims of adult offenders, the study includes
their sociodemographic backgrounds, the
victim-offender relationship, and the consequences
to the victim, such as injuries and weapon use by

* the Police-Public Contact Survey supplement to
the BJS National Crime Victimization Survey, which
gives the results of more than 6,000 interviews
with U.S. residents age 12 or older representative
of the U.S. population as a whole.  The survey
reports that about 21% of residents 12 or older

#95-BJ-CX-K021
Presents the recommendations developed during a
project directed jointly by BJS and the FBI to
identify 1) significant impediments to
participation in the National Incident-Based
Reporting System (NIBRS) by large local law
enforcement agencies nationwide and  2) promising
and cost-effective approaches to encourage wider
adoption of NIBRS. These recommendations were
developed in the course of completing five tasks: 
* surveyed each State agency that collects and
reports Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) data to the
FBI and produced detailed profiles of the NIBRS
implementation status of all 50 States and the
District of Columbia
* surveyed vendors to collect data about the
capabilities of their IBR-compatible software
systems to produce NIBRS vendor profiles
* surveyed key technical staff in the 64 largest
police and sheriffs' departments, serving
jurisdictions of more than 300,000 population, to
assess their technical capacity to meet national
NIBRS standards
* convened five regional focus groups in October
1996 at which key policy representatives of the 64
large agencies (from 28 States and D.C.) discussed
experiences and exchanged views
*contracted with a cost analyst to create a
defensible protocol to estimate the cost of
implementing NIBRS 
in local agencies and States. 
The recommendations were reviewed by the project
steering committee and the UCR subcommittee of the
FBI's Criminal Justice Information Services
Advisory Policy Board (CJIS APB) and then were
endorsed unanimously in December 1996 by the full
CJIS APB.

National Data Collection on Police Use of Force
100pp, 8/96; Institute for Law and Justice, BJS
award  #OJP-94-C-008.
This discussion paper,  published jointly with the
National Institute of Justice, summarizes prior
research on police use of force and lists the
difficulties inherent in collecting use-of-force
data, including definitional problems, reluctance
of police agencies to provide reliable data,
concerns about the misapplication of reported
data, and the degree of detail needed on
individual incidents.  It also discusses
alternative approaches to data collection and
sources of data, including official records,
surveys of police, and surveys of citizens.  The
paper concludes that it will be some time before a
national reporting program  is implemented. In the
meantime two pilot programs are collecting data on
use of force: an expansion of the BJS National
Crime Victimization Survey to include questions
about use of force and a grant to the
International Association of Chiefs of Police for
the first phase of a four-phase program to
establish a national database to collect incident
reports on use of force from police departments.

Based on 1991 data provided by three States for
the initial reporting year of the National
Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS), this BJS
Technical Report compares the NIBRS with the
traditional FBI Uniform Crime Reports, discusses
ways to make the NIBRS data file more suitable for
analysis, and describes various NIBRS data
elements and their reporting levels.  The report
includes tables based on analyses of rape and
personal robbery incidents that illustrate the
types of findings NIBRS data may provide as
participation in the system grows.  Data presented
include the victim-offender relationship, type of
location of the incident, type of weapon used,
type of injury sustained by the victim, and sex,
age, and race of offender and victim.

Juveniles Prosecuted in State Criminal Courts: 
National Survey of Prosecutors, 1994
7pp, 3/97, 6 tables, 3 figures; 
Carol J. DeFrances, 
Kevin J. Strom, BJS 
This report, sponsored jointly with the Office of
Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention,
presents selected findings from the 1994 BJS
National Survey of Prosecutors and other BJS
statistical series, as well as data collected by
the National Center for Juvenile Justice on
juveniles proceeded against in State criminal
courts.  Among prosecutors' offices handling
juvenile cases, almost two-thirds reported
transferring at least one juvenile case to
criminal court in 1994.  Sixteen percent of the
prosecutors' offices handling juvenile cases had
written guidelines about the transfer of juveniles
to criminal court.  National data on juvenile
cases judicially waived to criminal court show
that  the percentage of cases waived has remained
relatively constant at about 1.4% since 1985. In
1994, 12,300 juvenile cases were judicially
waived.

This Bulletin presents findings from the 1994
National Survey of Prosecutors, the most recent in
a series of biennial sample surveys of the
Nation's 2,300 State court prosecutors. The survey
found that in 1994, State court prosecutors
employed about 65,000 attorneys, investigators,
and support staff.  Almost 90% of the offices
prosecuted domestic violence and child abuse
cases.  Half the offices reported that a staff
member received a work-related threat or assault.
More than half the offices in large metropolitan
areas had specialized units to handle juvenile
cases in adult criminal court. Other data from the
survey include the annual office budget for
prosecutorial functions, number of felony cases
closed, and number of felony convictions.  New
topic areas covered in this report include
juvenile cases waived to criminal court, the
cross-designation of prosecutors to litigate in
Federal court, procedures for handling civil
actions against prosecutors and other professional
staff, and types of community involvement by
prosecutors.

This BJS Discussion Paper combines the
quantitative results of a mail survey sent to
local prosecutors with the qualitative results of
a followup telephone interview.  After giving a
brief history of Federal and State
Racketeer-Influenced and Corrupt Organization
(RICO) legislation,  the paper discusses how
widely local prosecutors use RICO, why some
prosecutors do not use the statute, and what can
be done to improve the State RICO laws.  Although
other studies have been done on Federal and State
civil RICO prosecutions, this is the first study
of RICO use in criminal cases at the local level.

20pp, forthcoming; John Scalia, BJS
Describes the increase in petitions filed in
Federal courts by Federal and State inmates from
1980 to 1995, as well as the high dismissal rate
and the low success rate. Inmates can challenge
the constitutionality of their incarceration or
the conditions of their confinement or compel
government officials to perform a duty owed.
Federal inmates can challenge the
constitutionality of the sentence imposed. 
Between 1980 and 1995, prisoner petitions filed in
U.S. district court nearly tripled, from 23,230 to
63,634, keeping pace with prison population
growth; petitions appealed to the U.S. courts of
appeal quadrupled, from 3,675 to 14,981. In 1995,
62% of prisoner petitions filed and 52% of those
appealed were dismissed. Less than 2% of those
filed were decided in favor of the inmate.

Describes juvenile offenders processed in the
Federal criminal justice system, including the
number of juveniles charged with acts of
delinquency, the offenses for which they were
charged, the proportion adjudicated delinquent,
and the sanctions imposed.  Few juveniles are
adjudicated in the Federal criminal justice
system.  During 1995, 468 juveniles were referred
to Federal prosecutors for investigation.  Of
these cases, 49% were declined further action. 
Almost half (47%) of juveniles adjudicated in the
Federal courts during 1995 were charged with
either a violent offense (32%) or a drug offense
(15%).  About a third (37%) of those adjudicated
delinquent were committed to a Federal
correctional facility.  The average length of
confinement ordered was 34 months.  Of the
juvenile delinquents confined by the Federal
Bureau of Prisons, 61% were Native Americans.

Comparing Case Processing Statistics   
2pp, 8/96, 1 table; jointly published by BJS 
and 4 other Federal agencies; 
John Scalia, BJS 
This joint statement of five Federal criminal
justice agencies identifies the primary
differences in case processing statistics reported
by the agencies and explains why the reported
statistics are not directly comparable.  The five
agencies are the Administrative Office of the U.S.
Courts, the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the
Executive Office for the U.S. Attorneys, the
Federal Bureau of Prisons, and the U.S. Sentencing
Commission.  By examining issues central to the
collection and reporting of Federal criminal
justice statistics--defendants processed, offenses
committed, and disposition and sentence
imposed--this statement clarifies differences in
emphasis, definition, and classification.  As part
of an ongoing effort to reconcile the case
processing statistics reported by each agency, the
agencies plan to develop selected statistics that
observe uniform reporting standards.  In addition,
as part of its Federal Justice Statistics Program,
BJS will continue to publish the Compendium of
Federal Justice Statistics, which describes all
stages of the Federal criminal justice system.

prosecuted, and the sanctions imposed.  The number
of noncitizens prosecuted in U.S. district courts
tripled, from 3,462 during 1984 to 10,352 during
1994.  In 1994, 45% of noncitizens prosecuted in
U.S. district courts were charged with a drug
offense.  More than 50% of the noncitizens
prosecuted in U.S. district courts were prosecuted
in the Federal judicial districts near the
Southwest border.  Information describing classes
of noncitizens, the processing of illegal aliens,
and Federal grants to States to help defray the
costs of incarcerating illegal aliens is also

Nation's courts convicted about 168,000 adults of
a violent felony:  an estimated 165,000 in State
courts and less than 3,000 in Federal courts. 
Federal courts accounted for about 2% of all
violent felony convictions in the Nation.  In 1992
convictions for violent, property, drug and other
felonies totaled 41,673 in Federal courts and
893,630 in State courts, or 1,103,161 altogether.

Indigent Defense
4pp, 2/96, 8 tables; Steven K. Smith, 
Carol J. DeFrances, BJS 
This report presents selected findings drawn from
various BJS surveys containing information related
to the indigent defense for criminal defendants. 
Twenty-eight percent of State court prosecutors
reported in 1992 that their jurisdiction used
public defender programs exclusively to provide
indigent counsel.  In 1990 State and local
governments spent approximately $1.3 billion on
public defender services.  In 1979 this figure was
about $300 million.  In constant 1990 dollars,
State and local expenditures doubled for public
defense from 1979 to 1990.  About three-fourths of
the inmates in State prisons and about half of
those in Federal prisons in 1991 received publicly
provided legal counsel for the offense for which
they were serving time.

This Special Report presents 1992 data on
disposition of 366,000 contract cases involving
1.3 million litigants in State general
jurisdiction courts in the Nation's 75 largest
counties. The most frequent type of contract
dispute involved the plaintiff as a seller seeking
payment owed by a buyer or borrower.  About half
the contract cases were resolved through an agreed
settlement.  Less than 3% of the cases were
disposed by a jury or bench trial.  Businesses
made up two-thirds of the plaintiffs in contract
cases; individuals, about a quarter.  Contract
case defendants were most often businesses,
followed by individuals. Almost two-thirds of the
contract cases were disposed within 1 year of
filing.

Violent Offenders in State Prison:  
Sentences and Time Served--
State Inmates, 1992-94   
10pp, 7/95; Allen J. Beck, 
Lawrence A. Greenfeld, BJS 
For the first time BJS reports jurisdiction-level
data on sentence length and time served for
violent prison inmates who were admitted or
released in 1992, 1993, and 1994.  Using
guidelines developed in the BJS National
Corrections Reporting Program, 49 States and the
District of Columbia provided data on new court
commitments and first releases of violent
offenders, including the number, the average
sentence length, the projected minimum time to be
served before release for admissions, and the time
served in prison and jail for releases. (Violent
offenders are those convicted of homicide,
kidnaping, forcible rape, sexual assault, robbery,
assault, or other crimes involving the threat or
imposition of harm upon the victim, including
extortion, intimidation, reckless endangerment,
hit-and-run driving with injury, or child abuse.) 
Jurisdictional variations and trends are

The data brief notes the association between
firearms involvement and an increased severity of
sentence as well as a more extensive criminal
history for Federal prisoners. The number of
offenders sentenced to Federal prison grew 175%
from 1982 to 1992. In the 12 months before
September 30, 1993, firearms were involved in
sentences of almost 7,000 offenders, about a sixth
of those sentenced under Federal guidelines.

A. Goerdt, National Center for State Courts
Juries in the 75 largest counties disposed of
12,000 tort, contract, and real property rights
cases during a 12-month period ending June 30,
1992.  Jury cases were 2% of the 762,000 tort,
contract and real property cases disposed by State
courts of general jurisdiction in the Nation's
most populous counties.  Thirty-three percent of
cases decided by juries were automobile accident
suits, 11% were medical malpractice, and 5% were
product liability and toxic substance cases.  In
half of all jury cases, the jury found in favor of
the plaintiff and in the 12-month period awarded
an estimated $2.7 billion in compensatory and
punitive damages.  The median total award for a
plaintiff was $52,000.  Punitive damages were
awarded in 6% of the jury cases with a plaintiff
winner.  The median punitive award was $50,000;
average time from complaint filing to jury verdict
was 2.5 years.

Patrick  A. Langan, BJS, and John Goerdt, National
Center for State Courts
Three out of four tort cases filed in the Nation's
75 most populous counties never reached the
courtroom because they were settled out of court. 
Only 3% went to trial, with the plaintiff winning
about half the time.  The study of an estimated
378,000 State tort cases (about half of all tort
suits completed from July 1, 1991, through June
30, 1992) found that more than 75% involved
automobile accidents or property liability claims. 
Medical malpractice, product liability, and toxic
substance cases accounted for 10%.  Half the tort
cases were disposed within 14 months, and auto
tort cases were settled in a shorter period than
all other cases.  Half of all tort cases involved
three or more litigants. Torts are wrongful
acts--not including contract disputes--that result
in injury to another's person, property, or
reputation and for which the injured party is
entitled to compensation.  This study is based on
a representative sample of the 75 courts where
nearly half of all tort cases nationwide are
handled, making this the closest that exists to a
national tort study.

Prison Sentences and Time Served for Violence
3pp, 4/95, 7 tables; Lawrence A. Greenfeld, BJS 
Violent offenders released from State prisons in

received--an average of 43 months in confinement,
both jail and prison, on an average sentence of 89
months.  The finding that just under half the
sentence will be served in confinement was
confirmed through analysis of self-reports of
expected discharge dates from the 1991 BJS
National Survey of State Prison Inmates.  Prison

States reveal wide disparity across the States in
sentence length but substantially less disparity
and greater consensus on the duration of time
spent in confinement. The findings are from BJS
data collection programs, including the annual
National Corrections Reporting Program (NCRP) and
the 1991 sample survey of State prisoners.  The
report also estimates the hypothetical impact on
time served of changing the percentage of sentence
served and discusses how the States differ in
percentage of sentence served.

Challenging the Conditions of Prisons and Jails:  
A Report on Section 1983 Litigation 
44pp, 2/95, 10 tables, 2 figures; Roger A. Hanson,
Henry W.K. Daley, National Center for State
Courts, BJS award #92-BJ-CX-K026
This Discussion Paper furnishes systematic data on
litigation under Section 1983 of the U.S. Code,
which the U.S. Supreme Court has interpreted to
permit prisoners to sue correctional officials in
Federal court when the conditions of confinement
fail to meet constitutional standards.  Section
1983 litigation represents 1 in 10 of the civil
cases filed in U.S. district courts.  This profile
of such lawsuits examining more than 2,700 cases
disposed of in 1992 in 9 States (Alabama,
California, Florida, Indiana, Louisiana, Missouri,
New York, Pennsylvania, and Texas) shows that 95%
of cases result in dismissals, 4% result in
stipulated dismissals or settlements, and 2%
result in trial verdicts (of these, less than 1/2
of 1% result in a favorable verdict for the
prisoner).

This edition, the fourth guide to the Nation's
courts sponsored by BJS and the third prepared by
NCSC, includes an examination of Federal courts,
as well as charts that summarize each State court
structure.  It describes five aspects of State
court organization:
* trial courts (the role of grand juries,
peremptory jury challenges, jury verdict rules)
* appellate courts (case selection, expedited
procedures)
* governance of court systems (budgets,
administration)
* judges and judicial selection (numbers of
judges, mandatory judicial education)
* processing of criminal cases (felony definition,
mandatory minimum, habitual offender sentencing
provisions).

Felony Sentences in State Courts, 1992
11pp, 1/95, 12 tables; Patrick A. Langan, 
Helen A. Graziadei, BJS
This nationally representative survey of 300
counties found that in 1992 about 171,000 men and
women were convicted in State felony courts of
trafficking in illegal drugs, over twice as many
as in 1986, accounting for 30% of the increase in
felony convictions nationwide from 1986 to 1992. 
About 48% of the 1992 convicted traffickers were
sent to a State prison versus 37% in 1986.  The
total number of State felony convictions increased
53% from 1986 to 1992.  Urban counties with
populations over 600,000 had felony convictions up
71% and drug trafficking convictions up 116%. 
This BJS Bulletin presents conviction rates for 10
other offense categories as well as the sex, race,
and age of convicted felons.

Murder in Families
12pp, 7/94, 14 tables; 
John M. Dawson, Patrick A. Langan, BJS
This BJS Special Report, a survey of murder cases
disposed in 1988 in the courts of large urban
counties, found that 16% of murder victims were
members of the defendant's family:  6.5% were
killed by their spouses, 3.5% by their parents,
1.9% by their own children, 1.5% by their
siblings, and 2.6% by other relatives.  Women were
45% of the victims in murders involving family
members but 18% of victims in other murders. 
Among family murder defendants, 35% were female
versus 7% among nonfamily defendants.  Women were
over half of the defendants (55%) in only one
category of family murder:  parents killing their
offspring.  Firearms were used in 42% of family
murders, compared to 63% of nonfamily murders.

Felony Sentencing and Jail Characteristics
24pp, 6/93, 6 tables, 2 figures; John M. Dawson,
BJS
This BJS Discussion Paper explores the possible
impact of jail conditions on the likelihood that a
convicted felon will be sentenced to a county jail
rather than a State prison.  For this study, the
BJS data collection on felony sentencing in 1988
was merged with the data from the 1988 jail
census.  The data suggest that certain programs
such as work release may influence judges to
sentence nonviolent felons to jail rather than to
prison or probation.

Murder in Large Urban Counties, 1988 
13pp, 5/93, 25 tables, 3 figures; 
John M. Dawson, BJS, and Barbara 
Boland, formerly of Abt Associates
This BJS Special Report represents almost 10,000
prosecuted murder defendants and more than 8,000
murder victims in the Nation's 75 most populous
counties in 1988--about half of the Nation's
murder arrestees for that year and just under half
of the murder victims.  The study, which
summarizes the circumstances of the murders, found
that 80% of the murder victims knew their killers,
16% were related to their killers, and 52% had a
romantic or social relationship with their
murderers.  About a 3rd of the female victims and
a 10th of the male victims were killed by a spouse
or romantic partner.  About three-quarters of the
victims were male, just over half were black, and
nearly half were ages 15 to 29.

Provides information on facilities, inmates,
programs and staff of State and Federal
correctional facilities throughout the Nation.
Earlier censuses were conducted in 1974, 1979,
1984, and 1990. Information was collected from
1,390 public and 110 private facilities, including
general confinement institutions, prison boot
camps, reception/diagnosis/classification centers,
prison hospitals, and facilities for alcohol and
drug treatment, work release/prerelease, and
youthful offenders.  In the 5 years between
censuses, prison construction nearly kept pace
with prison population growth.  Between 1990 and
1995 State and Federal governments added 213
prisons and more than 280,000 prison
beds--representing a 41% increase in prison
capacity.  In 1995 State prisons were on average
operating at 4% above rated capacity and Federal
prisons at 25% above capacity.  At mid-1995 about
1 in 4 State correctional facilities were under
court order or consent decree to limit population
or to address specific conditions.  In 1995,
correctional authorities recorded more than 14,000
assaults on prison staff, up 32% from 1990, and
nearly 26,000 assaults on inmates, up 20% from
1990.  Relative to the number of inmates, however,
the annual number of assaults on other inmates
dropped from 31 per 1,000 inmates in 1990 to 27
per 1,000 in 1995, and the number of assaults on
staff remained unchanged at 15 per 1,000 inmates.

39pp, 1/97, 4 tables, 32 figures; 
Lawrence A. Greenfeld, BJS 
Draws on more than two dozen statistical datasets
maintained by BJS and on data from the Uniform
Crime Reporting (UCR) Program of the FBI.  It
provides a comprehensive overview of knowledge
about the incidence and prevalence of violent
victimization by sexual assault, the response of
the criminal justice system to such crimes, and
the characteristics of those who commit sexual
assault or rape.  Findings include the following: 

* Convicted rape and sexual assault offenders
serving time in State prisons report that
two-thirds of their victims were under the age of
18, and 58% of those, or nearly 4 in 10 imprisoned
violent sex offenders, said their victims were age
12 or younger.
* In 90% of the rapes of children less than 12
years old, the child knew the offender, according
to police-recorded incident data.
* Among victims 18 to 29 years old, two-thirds had
a prior relationship with the rapist. 
* Four datasets (the FBI's  UCR arrests, State
felony court convictions, prison admissions, and
the National Crime Victimization Survey) all point
to a sex offender who is older than other violent
offenders, generally in his early 30's, and more
likely to be white than other violent offenders.

Prison and Jail Inmates at Midyear 1996 
12pp, 1/97, 9 tables, 2 figures; 
Allen J. Beck, Darrell K. Gilliard, BJS
Announces that the Nation's jail and prison
incarceration rate has nearly doubled in the last
10 years. In 1985 jails and prisons held an
estimated 313 inmates per 100,000 U.S. residents. 
At midyear 1996 this rate had increased to 615
inmates per 100,000 residents. More than 1.6
million men and women were held in the Nation's
jails and prisons at the end of June 1996.  At
midyear there were 93,167 Federal prisoners,
1,019,281 State prisoners, and 518,492 jail
inmates.  An additional 72,997 persons were
supervised by jail authorities outside of jail
facilities in programs such as electronic
monitoring, house detention, community service, or
work release.  Between July 1, 1995, and June 30,
1996, the total number of persons incarcerated
grew by 4.4%--4.3% for Federal prisons, 5.6% for
State prisons, and 2.3% percent for local jails. 
These growth rates were significantly lower than
the average annual rates recorded since 1985.

This report announces that there were almost 1.6
million men and women in the Nation's jails and
prisons in 1995.  State and Federal prisons, which
primarily house convicted felons serving sentences
of more than a year, held about two-thirds of the
incarcerated population (1,078,357 inmates) at the
end of 1995.  The other third were confined in
locally operated jails, which normally hold people
awaiting trial or serving sentences of a year or
less.  On June 3, 1995, the most recent date for
which jail data are available, 507,044 people were
in local jails and another 34,869 were being
supervised by jail authorities in programs such as
electronic monitoring, house detention, community
service, or work release.  For the first time, the

U.S. correctional population.  An estimated 3.2%
of all men age 18 or older were on probation or
parole, and 1 in 22 men were under the care,
custody, or control of a corrections agency.  The
press release provides two tables by State, a
table summarizing total corrections populations
since 1980, and a table with estimates of the
number men and women supervised in the community.

Annual reports provide criminal justice
expenditure and employment data on spending and
personnel levels for the specified year.  The 1992
and 1993 reports include national trend data after
1980 for Federal, State, and local governments for
three sectors:  police protection, judicial and
legal services (courts, legal services and
prosecution, and public defense), and corrections. 
Presents expenditure data for fiscal years,
employment and payroll data for October, capital
outlay, intergovernmental expenditure, and
employment and payroll data by sector for
individual State and large local governments.  The
data are from the Census Bureau's annual sample
surveys of governmental finance and employment,
modified to conform more closely to definitions
and classification schemes developed by BJS for
its periodic Justice Expenditure and Employment
Survey.  Data from the two series are not
comparable: definitional and other differences in
the series are discussed in an appendix.  Two
other appendixes define terms and present relative
standard errors of the estimates in the reports.

State Justice Statistics Program 
for Statistical Analysis Centers:  
Program Application Guidelines, 
Fiscal Year 1997
22pp, 11/96
This program announcement provides information for
applying for Fiscal 1997 cooperative agreements,
and replaces State-Level Statistical Analysis
Centers (SACs) and Information Network Program. 
The SJS program is oriented around issues and
products.  It requires that topics/issues of
investigation and analysis be selected from among
a list of themes published in this announcement
and updated approximately every 6 months.  Some of
the themes may carry extra financial support for
SACs.  SACs are encouraged to collaborate with
other State agencies in addressing these themes. 
While SACs may use past awards as a guide in
preparing an application, the actual amount of the
award under the SJS program is contingent on
sufficiently strong justification of the tasks and
activities proposed in the application.
