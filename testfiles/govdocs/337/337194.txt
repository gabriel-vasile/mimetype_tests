NOTE TO EDITORS

Because of a clerical error, some identification numbers for
earlier enforcement actions taken against national banks
were reported incorrectly.   Therefore, the revised list
of enforcement actions follows.  Please adjust your
files accordingly.  

A list of enforcement actions previously disclosed and copies
of the actual documents are available from the OCC's
Communications Division by writing to: Comptroller of the
Currency, Public Information Room (1-5), Washington, DC
20219.  Requests made by facsimile transmission should to be
sent to (202) 874-4448.  Please include the identifying
enforcement action number when placing an order.  Enforcement
actions are also listed monthly in OCC Interpretations and
Actions.  Subscriptions to that publication are available
from the OCC's Communications Division.

The OCC also maintains a searchable database of all public
enforcment actions taken since August 1989 on its Internet Web
Site located at http://www.occ.treas.gov/enforce.htm.
