                 In the Matter of JENNIFER HARRIS


     Jennifer Harris, Denver, CO, Claimant.

     Marianne Myles, Director, Recruitment, Examination and Employment, Department
of State, Washington, DC, appearing for Department of State.

BORWICK, Board Judge.

     Claimant, Ms. Jennifer Harris, is an officer in the Department of State's (agency's)
Foreign Service.  She contests the agency's determination that she was not entitled to travel
benefits as a new appointee from Denver, Colorado.  The agency treated her as a new
appointee from Washington, D.C., where she had resided for some time before her
appointment to the Foreign Service.  We deny the claim, since the agency correctly applied
the Foreign Affairs Manual (FAM).       

                            Background

     On August 10, 2004, the agency notified claimant of her eligibility for appointment
as a Junior Officer in the Foreign Service.  On November 15, 2004, the agency offered
claimant a position as a Foreign Service Officer/Career Candidate for the January 2005 class. 
When claimant received the appointment offer, she resided at an address within metropolitan
Washington, D.C., well within the fifty-mile radius of the designated temporary duty station. 
Claimant had been living and working in the metropolitan Washington area for over a year
before the agency's appointment offer.  The agency addressed both the eligibility notification
and the appointment offer to claimant's Washington address.  

     Claimant says that she was born and raised in Colorado, attended college in Boston,
Massachusetts, and worked at the United States Embassy in Paris as a paid intern until May
2003.  Having completed her internship, claimant then started what she regarded as short-
term employment for a Department of State contractor in Virginia, having, during her
internship, already started the process of applying for a position in the Foreign Service. 
Claimant states that although she lived in Washington, D.C., she maintained her permanent
residence in Denver, Colorado.  Claimant notes that she kept her Colorado driver's license, 
voted in Colorado, had her credit card bills sent to her Colorado address, and paid taxes as
a Colorado resident.  Claimant says that in the summer of 2004, when the agency confirmed
her security and medical clearances in connection with her application for an appointment
in the Foreign Service, she sublet her apartment in Washington and lived in a friend's
apartment.  She notes that most of her belongings were in Colorado.

     In its appointment notification, the agency told claimant that since she was appointed
from within the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area, she was not authorized to receive per
diem reimbursement nor was she authorized shipment of her household goods until her
departure from the area on travel orders.  The agency advised claimant that it regarded
claimant's initial assignment to the Washington, D.C., area as a temporary training
assignment.  The agency also told claimant that her initial orientation would be seven weeks
in duration at the National Foreign Affairs Training Center, with total training to last between
ten weeks and one year, depending on the requirements of the overseas position to which
claimant would be assigned.  

     Claimant disputed the agency's determination that she was appointed to the Foreign
Service from the Washington, D.C., area, and maintained she was entitled to per diem and
subsistence as if she had been appointed from Denver, Colorado.  She regards Denver,
Colorado as her legal residence because she maintained her ties to Colorado as described
above.  

                            Discussion

     At the relevant time the FAM provided:

     New appointees who reside within 80 kilometers (50 miles) of the temporary
     duty location at the time of appointment or other employees who commute
     daily from their permanent residence, are not entitled to any per diem or
     subsistence.  

6 FAM 151.2(c).
 [Foot # 1 ] 

****************** Footnote Begin **********
[Foot # 1 ]        The identical provision is now found at 14 FAM 571.2(c).  
****************** Footnote End ************

     At the time of her appointment to the Foreign Service, and for a period of time before
that, claimant actually resided in Washington, D.C., within fifty miles of the temporary duty
station.  The FAM uses the verb "reside" in the section quoted above to mean the act of
actually physically residing in a place, not the act of establishing a purported legal residence. 
The law applicable to entitlements for newly appointed civilian Executive Branch employees
is to the same effect.  See 5 U.S.C.   5723 (2000); Anthony P. Belmont, M.D., GSBCA
15463-RELO, 01-1 BCA   31,344.  In an analogous context, in the Federal Travel
Regulation, the term "residence" for entitlement to real estate transaction expenses means
the actual residence to and from which the employee commutes daily, not a place that the
employee regards as his or her legal residence.  See Paul Henderson, GSBCA 15480-RELO,
01-2 BCA   31,501.  The Board denies the claim.
