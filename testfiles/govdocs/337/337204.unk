APPEARANCES:   James A. Howell and Marianne Wisner for the
               Division of Enforcement, Securities and Exchange
               Commission

               Thomas F. Goodman for Respondent D'Acquisto

BEFORE:        Lillian A. McEwen, Administrative Law Judge


                        PROCEDURAL HISTORY

     The United States Securities and Exchange Commission
("Commission") instituted these proceedings pursuant to Sections
203(e) and 203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940
("Advisers Act").  The Order Instituting Proceedings ("OIP") was
filed on December 18, 1995.  
                           THE HEARING

     On August 6, 1996, a public hearing commenced before me in
Los Angeles, California.  It ended on the same day.  The hearing
record consists of the testimony of two witnesses and several
exhibits.  I admitted into evidence eight joint exhibits; one
exhibit from the Division of Enforcement ("Division"); and three
exhibits from the Respondent.-[1]-  The Respondent was not
present at the hearing.  His appearance was waived by his
attorney.  (Tr. 3-4.)

                              ISSUES

     On June 6, 1996, the Division filed a Motion to Amend Order
Instituting Proceedings.  The Respondent stated that he did not
intend to oppose the Motion and has not filed an opposition to
it.  In my August 1, 1996, Prehearing Order, I stated that I
would rule on the Division's  Motion after the hearing, pursuant
to Rule 200(d)(2) of the Commission's Rules of Practice.  Comment
(d) to the Rule states in part:

          The Commission has stated that amendment of orders
     instituting proceeding should be freely granted,
     subject only to the consideration that other parties
     should not be surprised, nor their rights prejudiced. 
     Carl L. Shipley, 45 S.E.C. 589, 595 (1974).  Where
     amendments to an order instituting proceedings are
     intended to correct an error, to conform the order to
     the evidence or to take into account subsequent
     developments which should be considered in disposing of
     the proceeding, and the amendments are within the scope
     of the original order, either a hearing officer or the
     Commission has authority to amend the order.  See,
     e.g., Don A. Long, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 233
     (Mar. 31, 1980), 52 SEC Docket 497 (Aug. 18, 1992)
     (hearing officer's grant of motion to conform pleading
     to evidence adduced at hearing). 

     The Division wishes to amend the OIP to include the
following three allegations:

     (1) from June, 20, 1984 through the present, John
     Francis D'Acquisto has been associated with D'Acquisto
     and Associates, Inc., a registered investment Adviser; 
     (2) that both John Francis D'Acquisto and D'Acquisto
     and Associates, Inc. registered as an Investment
     Adviser; and (3) that the Franchise Tax Board for the
     State of California suspended D'Acquisto and
     Associates, Inc. as a corporation prior to June 20,
     1984, and it has never been revived.

(Division's Motion at 2.)
 
I find that the amendment is intended to correct an error or to
conform the Order to the evidence and that the new matters are
within the scope of the original OIP.  Thus, the Division's
Motion to Amend Order Instituting Proceedings is hereby GRANTED
and the OIP is hereby amended to include the three allegations
described above.

     The next issue before me is whether on September 20, 1995,
the United States District Court for the Southern District of
California handed down a Partial Summary Judgment Order that
==========================================START OF PAGE 3======

permanently enjoined Respondent D'Acquisto from violations of
Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act"),
and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
("Exchange Act"), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, in SEC v. D'Acquisto
Financial Group, Inc., Doubleday Trust, John F. D'Acquisto and
Thomas F. Goodman,  Civil Action No. CV-95-1105H (AJB) (S.D.
Cal.)  If I find that the Respondent was enjoined as described,
the second issue is whether and how he should be sanctioned.
     After the hearing, the Division filed its Proposed Findings
of Fact and Conclusions of Law and a Reply Brief.  The Respondent
filed a Post-Hearing Brief.

                         FINDINGS OF FACT

     The findings and conclusions herein are based on the entire
record.  I applied preponderance of the evidence as the
applicable standard of proof for the Division's case.

     The Respondent is 44 years old.  He graduated from high
school in 1970, and he attended business school for one year and
took "extension courses" in finance and economics for two years. 
From 1973 to 1979, he worked at the Bank of America in San
Francisco, and from 1979 to 1982, he was a loan agent at the Sun
Savings and Loan Association in San Diego.  In 1983, he became an
investment adviser with D'Acquisto and Associates, Inc., (Joint
Ex. 6 at 17), where he also had been president and chairman since
November 1979.  (Joint Ex. 6 at 14.)  D'Acquisto and Associates,
Inc., had its "corporate powers, rights and privileges" suspended
on August 2, 1982, by the State of California.  (Joint Ex. 3.) 
By December 1986, the Respondent had filed for individual,
Chapter 13 bankruptcy.  (Joint Ex. 6 at 17.)

     D'Acquisto, Goodman and Associates, Inc., ("DGA"), with the
Respondent as president (Joint Ex. 4 at 29), applied for
registration as an investment adviser on May 14, 1984.  (Joint
Ex. 4 at 1, 10.)   In the category of "the types of clients for
which the investment adviser generally provides investment
advice," the Respondent listed "individuals, and specified
classes of individuals, banks, investment companies and pension
and profit-sharing plans and limited partnerships."  Furthermore,
in the categories of methods of analysis, sources of information,
and investment strategies, the Respondent stated:

          DGA, Inc. will use many many methods of security
     analysis, fundamental analysis, technical analysis,
     cyclical analysis and charting will all be used in
     order to tailor an investment strategy that would
     benefit each of our clients.

          Through these types of analysis DGA, Inc. can
     distribute their client's interest into the most
     beneficial way.
==========================================START OF PAGE 4======

          . . . . 

          DGA, Inc. will use many sources of information. 
     The sources used will be as follows:

          Standard and Poors Research, Moody's Research,
     Daily Graphs from William O'Neil and Co., which follow
     each major stock exchange.  Miller and Schroeder
     Research, Wall Street Journal, Fortune, Forbes,
     Barrons, Money, and Dunn & Brad Street.

          . . . .

          DGA's investment strategies will usually be long
     term positions.  DGA implements long term conservative
     strategies but DGA will also implement for the more
     speculative clients, a strategy that would include
     margin transactions, short sales, and covered option
     writing.  DGA will very rarely ever use writing
     uncovered options.

(Joint Ex. 4 at 11.)

     The registration of "D'Acquisto and Associates, Inc.," was
granted on June 20, 1984.  (Joint Ex. 4 at 30.)  The application
(Joint Ex. 4) was the subject of an amendment application by the
Respondent on June 7, 1984, to change the name of the business to
D'Acquisto and Associates, Inc.  (Joint Ex. 5 at 2.)  There is no
indication in the record, however, that the amendment was
approved.  On the contrary, the Commission noted deficiencies in
the application.  (Joint Ex. 5 at 22.)

     On October 20, 1986, the Commission received the application
of John Francis D'Acquisto for investment adviser registration
doing business as D'Acquisto and Associates, Inc.  (Joint Ex. 6
at 2.)  Nothing in the record indicates that the Commission took
any action on the application.

     In January 1990 and October 1991 the Commission published
Notices of Intention to Cancel Registrations of Certain
Investment Advisers, including the Respondent.  (Resp. Ex. 1;
Resp. Ex. 2.)    John Francis D'Acquisto is included in the
appendix list of the Notices.  The 1991 Notice states:

          The Commission has been sending all registrants a
     booklet of registration materials annually since 1987. 
     Each booklet contains copies of Forms, ADV, ADV-S, ADV-
     E and ADV-W.  [FN2]  These forms, when properly filed,
     are used to update the Commission's records.  Since the
     1987 mailing, the Commission has had correspondence for
     each of the registrants listed in the Appendix returned
     as "undeliverable" (addressee unknown, forwarding order
==========================================START OF PAGE 5======

     expired, or no longer at this address) by U.S. Postal
     Service.  The Commission's records indicate that these
     registrants have not filed amendments to their
     registration, reflecting their current business and/or
     mailing addresses, as required by Rule 204-1(b).  The
     Commission's records also indicate that many of these
     registrants have not made annual filings of Form ADV-S,
     as required by Rule 204-1(c). Accordingly, the Division
     of Investment Management believes that reasonable
     grounds exist for a finding that these registrants are
     no longer in existence or are no longer engaged in
     business as investment advisers.

          . . . . 



          Form ADV-W is used to voluntarily withdraw from
registration as an investment      adviser.

(Resp. Ex. 1 at 1.)  

     During 1990 and 1991, Michael Paul Levitt was the branch
chief of the Investment Adviser and Investment Company
Examination Program in the Los Angeles region for the Commission.

(Tr. 63-64.)  Regarding Respondent's Exhibits One and Two,
Notices of Intention to Cancel Registration of Certain Investment
Advisers, each year the Commission prepares a cancellation list
composed of registered advisers whose registration packages have
been returned "because of bad addresses."  In 1990 and 1991,
Levitt asked the Commission to remove D'Acquisto's name from the
cancellation list because of "outstanding complaints" about him. 
(Tr. 65-66, 81.)  As a result, D'Acquisto's registration was not
cancelled in 1991 and he was still registered on the date of the
hearing.  (Tr. 66.)

     On May 20, 1993, the Respondent wrote a letter to the
Commission in reference to:  a debt that he owed to a client; his
bankruptcy case; the closing of D'Acquisto and Associates, Inc.,
in 1986; and his assertion that, "I would also like to make a
formal request to withdraw myself from the investment advisers
license."  (Joint Ex. 8 at 2.)

     On or about May 20, 1993, Levitt sent D'Acquisto a letter
asking him to contact him and to send him a letter stating he had
paid back his previous investors.  The Division of Enforcement
had declined to open a case against the Respondent.  (Resp. Ex.
3; Tr. 67-75.)  The Respondent never filed the proper request for
cancellation of his registration.  (Tr. 68-69.)

     On April 6, 1995, the United States District Court of the
Northern District of Illinois, in Sheridan Asset Management, Inc.
==========================================START OF PAGE 6======

v. Doubleday Trust, et al., issued an order that incorporates "a
resolution of part of the claims pending before the court" (Joint
Ex. 1 at 4) and that is signed by D'Acquisto.  (Joint Ex. 1 at
6.)  The case is in effect a suit filed by the two victims,
Sheridan Asset Management, Inc. ("Sheridan"), and Alliance
Holdings Limited ("Alliance"), against D'Acquisto, his various
corporations, and other defendants.  The settlement agreement
described in the order disposes of a $1,000,000 "security and
indemnity fund" among the interested parties.  It also vacates
the court's injunctive orders as of April 3, 1995.  (Joint Ex. 1
at 12.)  D'Acquisto and others signed the consent order.  (Joint
Ex. 1 at 6.)

     The statement of stipulated facts that accompanies the order
describes the misrepresentations and the fraudulent scheme
whereby D'Acquisto and others obtained $2,000,000 from Alliance
in March 1994 (Joint Ex. 1 at 7-12), and $4,800,000 from Dr.
Herbert Geisselmann later in 1994.  (Joint Ex. 1 at 13-15.) 
D'Acquisto and others promised to invest funds in securities, and
then converted the funds from the two investors to their own use
and engaged in unauthorized trades which resulted in losses from
July through September 1994. (Joint Ex. 1 at 13-17.)  D'Acquisto
and others also used the funds to purchase, among other things:

          1) a contingent interest in a Mexican minor league
     baseball team in a league which does not operate; 2)
     vacant land in Mexico; 3) . . . three racehorses; and
     (4) personal and business items and services.

(Joint Ex. 1 at 17; Joint Ex. 7 at 4-6.)

     When the investors demanded the return of their funds, in
September and October 1994, D'Acquisto and others refused to
return them.  (Joint Ex. 1 at 17-18.)

     On September 20, 1995, an Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion
for Partial Summary Judgment was issued by the United States
District Court of the Southern District of California in SEC v.
D'Acquisto Financial Group, Inc., et al., Civil Action No. CV-
1105H (AJB) (S.D. Cal.).  The Order cites the Sheridan case
(Joint Ex. 1) and notes that its facts are substantially similar.

(Joint Ex. 2 at 2.)  I adopt the findings of the court as
summarized below.  The court found that the defendants were
dealing in securities, not commodities trading (Joint Ex. 2 at
11), and that they were barred by collateral estoppel from
relitigating the Sheridan findings (Joint Ex. 2 at 9).  The court
granted the request for a permanent injunction (Joint Ex. 2 at
12-13) and ordered disgorgement.  (Joint Ex. 2 at 13.)

     The permanent injunction resulted from the court's explicit
findings that the Respondent and others had violated Securities
Act Section 17(a) and Exchange Act Section 10(b):
==========================================START OF PAGE 7======

          Finally, the stipulated facts demonstrate that
     defendants used the mails with scienter to forward
     their investment scheme and to make material false
     statements in connection with their scheme.  In
     offering and selling the program to Alliance and
     Geisselmann, defendants falsely alleged that they were
     sophisticated money managers with a great deal of
     experience and client contacts.  Defendants also
     repeatedly represented to Alliance and Geisselmann that
     their funds were earning substantial and significant
     profits, that their funds were secure, that the
     investment was low risk, and that the investment and
     earnings would be returned to the investors in a timely
     fashion.  As such the court finds defendants committed
     securities fraud in violation of both Section 10(b) and
     Section 17(a) and grants plaintiff's motion for partial
     summary judgement.

          . . . . 

          Based on the set of stipulated facts, the court
     finds that the SEC has made a showing which satisfies
     the standard for issuance of a permanent injunction. 
     Defendants have defrauded several groups of investors
     and according to declarations submitted by the SEC,
     defendants had previously been investigated by the
     Commission.  In testimony given before SEC staff, both
     individual defendants contended that the SEC had no
     authority over their activities.  Given defendants'
     repeated violations and disregard for the law, the
     court finds that defendants represent a risk to the
     public and grants plaintiff's motion for a permanent
     injunction.

(Joint Ex. 2 at 12.)

                        CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

                    Contentions of the Parties

I.   The Division

     The Division contends that the district court established
that D'Acquisto was acting as an investment adviser during the
perpetration of the fraudulent scheme that violated the
securities laws.  His solicitation of Alliance resulted in its
$2,000,000 investment and in its referral of Geisselmann to him. 
Geisselmann's investment of $4,800,000 followed shortly. 
(Division's Post Hearing Brief at 8-10.)  Efforts of the two
investors to recoup missing funds were unsuccessful.  (Id. at 11-
13.)  D'Acquisto misappropriated $6,500,000 of client funds. 
(Id. at 14.)  The injunction by the district court gives the
==========================================START OF PAGE 8======

Commission the authority to sanction D'Acquisto, and his
registration status is not determinative of whether he was acting
as an investment adviser or was a person associated with an
investment adviser.  (Id. at 16-18.)

     Finally, the Division argues that D'Acquisto is still a
registered investment adviser as a result of his application and
amendment to it, and the publication of his registration status. 
(Id. at 18-19.)  He has not successfully withdrawn his
application (Id. at 20.), and the Commission never cancelled the
registration.  (Id. at 21.)  The Division contends that
D'Acquisto is also associated with an investment adviser as a
result of his position as president of D'Acquisto and Associates,
Inc.; as control person of the same firm; and as a result of his
ownership of over 75% of the firm.  (Id. at 21.)  D'Acquisto's
failure to state in the application that California had suspended
the corporate status of D'Acquisto and Associates, Inc., was also
unlawful.

     The position of the Division is that D'Acquisto is barred by
collateral estoppel from challenging the district court's
decision.  (Id. at 27.)  It requests an order revoking his
investment adviser's registration and barring D'Acquisto from
associating with any investment adviser.  (Id. at 28.)

II.  The Respondent

     The Respondent contends that he made an error and never
intended to register separately as an individual and as a
corporation.  (Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief at 1-2.)  He
contends that he was not aware of the 1982 suspension of the
corporation, and that he had informed the Commission in 1993 of
the fact that D'Acquisto and Associates, Inc., "was no longer in
business and that he requested to withdraw as a licensed
investment advisor."  (Id. at 2.)  It was in his capacities as
trustee of Doubleday Trust and as president of D'Acquisto
Financial Group, Inc., a California corporation, that the
Respondent came to be accused of misconduct.

     He argues that as a trustee he could not violate the
Advisers Act.  He also contends that the Commission's failure to
comply with its "mandatory duty" to cancel the registration of
D'Acquisto and Associates, Inc., from 1991 to 1993 should relieve
him of the obligation to "follow the law" of the Advisers Act. 
Thus he maintains that the Commission has no jurisdiction over
him.  (Id. at 6-7.)
  
                    Evaluation of the Evidence

     D'Acquisto is properly before the Commission as a registered
investment adviser, one who is associated with an investment
adviser, or an investment adviser in fact.  He is subject to
==========================================START OF PAGE 9======

sanctions if the Commission finds after notice and opportunity
for a hearing that he is an investment adviser, or associated
with an investment adviser and:

     (3) is permanently . . . enjoined by order . . . of any
     court of competent jurisdiction . . . from engaging in
     or continuing any conduct or practice . . . in
     connection with the purchase or sale of any security.
     (4) has willfully violated any provision of the
     Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of
     1934, . . . this title, . . . or the rules or
     regulations under any such statutes . . .

Advisers Act Section 203(e).

     I conclude that the Respondent was permanently enjoined from
further violations of the securities laws by the United States
District Court for the Southern District of California, which is
a court of "competent jurisdiction."  I also conclude that the
investors Alliance and Geisselmann were persuaded to part with
large sums of money by the Respondent's false promises of
significant profits through investments in securities.  (Joint
Ex. 1; Joint Ex. 2.)  The Respondent was therefore an investment
adviser as defined in the applicable statute.

     Advisers Act Section 202(a)(11) defines an investment
adviser as "any person who, for compensation, engages in the
business of advising others, either directly or through
publications or writings, as to the value of securities or as to
the advisability of investing in, purchasing, or selling
securities, or who, for compensation and as part of a regular
business, issues or promulgates analyses or reports concerning
securities . . . ."  This section excludes from the definition of
investment adviser certain persons who would otherwise come
within the plain meaning of the definition, but who, for various
policy reasons, are not subject to the provisions of the Advisers
Act.  A determination as to whether a person is an investment
adviser will depend on whether the person:  (i) provides advice,
or issues reports or analyses, regarding securities; (ii) is in
the business of providing such services; and (iii) provides such
services for compensation.  Applicability of the Investment
Advisers Act, Advisers Act Release No. 1092, 39 SEC Docket 653,
657-62 (October 8, 1987).

     In Alexander V. Stein, 59 SEC Docket 1493 (June 8, 1995),
the Commission agreed with an administrative law judge and found
that, based on Stein's recent conviction for numerous securities,
mail, and wire fraud charges, he should be barred from the
investment advisory business.  Id. at 1502.  Stein withdrew the
investment adviser registration of one of the firms through which
he conducted his fraudulent scheme before the time of his
misconduct.  Id. at 1496-97 n.9.  Stein, therefore, disputed the
==========================================START OF PAGE 10======

Commission's authority to institute a proceeding pursuant to
Section 203(f) of the Advisers Act on the basis that he was
neither a registered investment adviser nor associated with a
registered investment adviser during the time of his misconduct. 
Id. at 1496.

     The Commission explained that its "authority to proceed
under Section 203(f) . . . does not rest on whether or not an
entity or individual has registered with this Commission.  It
does rest on whether or not an entity or individual in fact acted
as an investment adviser."  Id. at 1497 (footnote omitted).  The
Commission applied Adviser Act Section 202(a)(11), which defines
investment adviser, and Adviser Act Section 202(a)(17), which
defines person associated with an investment adviser, and
analyzed the respondent's actions.  Id. at 1497-98 & n.11; see
also, Applicability of the Investment Advisers Act, 39 SEC Docket
653 (clarifying elements of the definition of investment
adviser).  The Commission concluded that it had jurisdiction over
the proceeding based on Stein's conviction and the nature of his
activities.  Alexander V. Stein, 59 SEC Docket at 1498-99.  Stein
had held himself out as an investment adviser when he
recommended, in the course of his business activities, that
clients invest their funds with him.  Id. at 1498.  In his sales
pitch, Stein told clients how he would invest their funds and how
much money he could make for them.  Id. at 1498 n.12.  Stein
received an economic benefit for his services because he, in
effect, paid himself by diverting a portion of his clients' funds
for his personal use.  Id. at 1498 & n.13.

     I conclude that the Respondent was a registered investment
adviser at the time of the hearing.  Although his corporation was
suspended at the time of his application in 1984 (Joint Ex. 3;
Joint Ex. 4 at 1, 10), his application was approved by the
Commission on June 20, 1984.  (Joint Ex. 4 at 30.)  The
Commission never cancelled his registration.  (Resp. Ex. 1; Resp.
Ex. 2; Tr. 65-66.)  Furthermore, the Respondent never filed the
proper papers for cancellation of his registration.  (Tr. 68-69.)

 The Respondent has cited to no authority that required the
Commission to cancel his registration.

     Most importantly, even if the Respondent had successfully
withdrawn his registration, he "in fact acted as an investment
adviser," Alexander V. Stein, 59 SEC Docket at 1497, when he
persuaded the two clients to invest their funds with him;
misrepresented his scheme for disposing of the funds; and paid
himself a handsome fee by his diversion of client monies.

     The Respondent's argument that he was a mere trustee is
without merit.  Neither federal trial court found that contention
to be true.  The injunction that is at the heart of the instant
case was imposed by consent and is based on stipulated facts.

However, the securities laws make no exception for a consent
injunction.

     [T]he action required in the public interest as the
     result of an injunction may be inferred from all the
     circumstances surrounding the injunctive action. 
     Moreover, that precedent suggests that, in practical
     effect, the allegations in the complaint in an action
     settled by consent may, in a subsequent proceeding
     before us, be given considerable weight for purposes of
     assessing the public interest.  Defendants in
     injunctive actions should be aware of this consequence.

86 (11th Cir. 1994); see also Richard J. Puccio, 59 SEC Docket
2433 (July 10, 1995) (consent injunction in initial decision);
David M. Haber, 59 SEC Docket 59 (Apr. 5, 1995) (consent
injunction unaccompanied by findings of fact);  Peter C.
Calcutta, 55 SEC Docket 2500 (Dec. 23, 1993) (consent injunction
in initial decision); Michael Keith Howard, 56 SEC Docket 0576
(Feb. 25, 1994) (initial decision).

     A "consent injunction in which the allegations are denied,
no less than one issued after trial upon a determination of the
allegations, may furnish the sole basis for remedial action under
Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act if such action is in the public
interest."  Cortlandt Investing Corp., 44 S.E.C. 45, 53 (1969). 
Documents on which the court based its action serve to place the
injunction and its terms in perspective and are properly included
in the record.  Kimball Securities Inc., 39 S.E.C. 921, 923-924
(1960).  Thus, I have properly placed great weight on the earlier
findings made by two separate federal trial courts.

                       THE PUBLIC INTEREST
 
     At the time of the misconduct involved in the injunctive
action, Respondent D'Acquisto was an investment adviser, and the
injunction falls within one of the categories covered by the
applicable statute.  Hence, the remaining issue is the sanction
that is appropriate in the public interest.  In this light, I
have taken into account the following factors:

     the egregiousness of the defendant's actions, the
     isolated or recurrent nature of the infraction, the
     degree of scienter involved, the sincerity of the
     defendant's assurances against future violations, the
     defendant's recognition of the wrongful nature of his
     conduct, and the likelihood that the defendant's
     occupation will present opportunities for future
     violations.

Steadman v. SEC, 603 F.2d 1126, 1140 (5th Cir. 1979), aff'd on
other grounds, 450 U.S. 91 (1981).  The severity of a sanction
depends on the facts of each case and the value of the sanction
in preventing a recurrence.  Berko v. SEC, 316 F.2d 137, 141 (2d
Cir. 1963); Richard C. Spangler, Inc., 46 S.E.C. 238, 254 n.67
(1976); Leo Glassman, 46 S.E.C. 209, 211-12 (1975).

     Respondent D'Acquisto's actions were particularly egregious
because they involved the theft of millions of dollars from
investors.  The fraud occurred over a number of years, involved 
more than one investor, and did not result from an isolated event
but rather from a pattern of coordinated acts.  Scienter has been
described as "a mental state embracing intent to deceive,
manipulate, or defraud."  Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U.S.
185, 193 n.12 (1976).  Scienter is established by a showing that
the defendant acted intentionally or with severe recklessness. 
Raymond L. Dirks, 47 S.E.C. 434, 447 n.47 (1981), rev'd on other
grounds, 463 U.S. 646 (1983); see Broad v. Rockwell Int'l Corp.,
642 F.2d 929 (5th Cir. 1981); see also Warren v. Reserve Fund,
Inc., 728 F.2d 741, 745 (5th Cir. 1984); Hackbart v. Holmes, 675
F.2d 1114, 1118 (10th Cir. 1982); Sundstrand Corp. v. Sun
Chemical Corp., 553 F.2d 1033, 1039 (7th Cir. 1977).

     Respondent D'Acquisto's intent to deceive and defraud
investors is demonstrated by:  his ten-year employment in the
securities industry; the complexity of the schemes that were
generated to deceive the investors; the financial interest that
Respondent D'Acquisto maintained in the ventures; and the
recurring failures to repay the victims.  The high degree of
scienter established in the instant case is therefore obvious. 
The Respondent demonstrates no assurances against future
violations and he recognizes no wrongful conduct for which he
takes responsibility.  Finally, because his most productive adult
professional years have probably been spent in the securities
industry, he is likely to continue to work in the industry. 
Thus, he is likely to have fresh opportunities for future
violations of the securities laws.

     It is therefore in the public interest that the Respondent's
registration as an investment adviser be revoked and that he be
barred permanently from association with any investment
adviser.


                              ORDER

     Based on the findings and conclusions set forth above, I
ORDER, pursuant to Sections 203(e) and 203(f) of the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940, that John Francis D'Acquisto be, and hereby
is, barred from association with any investment adviser and that
his registration as an investment adviser be and hereby is
revoked.
