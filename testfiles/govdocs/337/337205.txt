INTRODUCTION


Owning and operating a child care business can be a very
challenging and rewarding career. Success in this field requires
dedication, love and patience. The work day is longer than a
normal eight-hour day, but the satisfaction of watching children
grow and develop will be worth the extra effort.

If you are interested in starting a child care business, this
publication will help you plan, prepare and operate your
business. It explains the step-by-step process of starting the
business, from assessing the need for child care services to
selecting the service, setting up your business and preparing for
opening day. A sample business plan outline for child care
businesses is included, in addition to a sample parent survey, a
typical undergraduate curriculum in early childhood instruction,
general resources and a list of related national organizations.

TYPES OF CHILD CARE PROGRAMS

According to the 1984 U.S. Census Bureau report, Who's Minding
the Kids?, parents generally select one of three types of child
care facilities: family care, home care or day-care center. There
are, however, other child care programs available, including the
following:

     *     Family care --  A program designed to provide care for
           toddlers in the homes of other mothers.

     *     Home care --  A nanny or sitter cares for and 
           supervises a child in the child's home.

     *     Day-care and child development centers --  Programs
           designed to respond to the stages of physical,
           emotional, social and intellectual growth and behavior
           of infants and children.

     *     Child care development home -- A private residence for
           up to five children, with no more than two infants in
           the group.

     *     Infant care center -- A child development center that
           cares for infants and toddlers (children two years old
           or younger).

     *     Before- and after-school care -- A program providing
           care for school-age children before and after the
           regular school day in a child development center or
           home.

     *     Satellite child development program --  A private
           residence linked with a child development center or an
           agency that receives technical assistance and support,
           training, recruiting and placement.

     *     Nursery school -- Usually a part-time preschool child
           development center operating during the school year.

For more information on child care programs in your community,
contact the local child care referral agency or local or state
licensing departments.

ASSESSING THE NEED FOR CHILD CARE PROGRAMS

National Need

The demand for child care services steadily increases as more and
more women enter the work force, giving up the traditional role
of full-time mother and homemaker. To date, working mothers -- in
both single- and two-parent households -- constitute the fastest
growing segment of the paid work force. According to a 1984 U.S.
Census Bureau report, the percentage of the work force made up of
married working women with school-age children grew from
42 percent in 1970 to over 60 percent, while the percentage of
mothers with preschool-age children increased from 32 percent to
52 percent in the same time period. Further substantiating this
increasing need for child care services, the U.S. Congressional
Budget Office reported that, by 1990, an additional 2.5 million
children will require some form of child care. The Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) reported that, in 1983, 6.4 million
families received a $2.6 billion reduction in their federal
income taxes from the Dependent Care Tax Credit.

Community Need

The easiest and most efficient way to determine the child care
need in your community is to go directly to the source, that is,
parents. The information they give you will be invaluable.

Perhaps the best way to gather information is to arrange an
interview with several families (a focus group) or conduct a mail
or telephone survey. You can find participants for your survey
through local churches or community groups. A sample survey is
included in Appendix B.

Census data for your community are another source for the
following demographic information:

     *     Number of families in your community.

     *     Number of working families with children zero to six
           years old.

     *     Number of working families with children seven to
           fourteen years old.

     *     Number of recent marriages.

     *     Number of new housing starts.

     *     Geographic concentration of families with children.

     *     Income distribution of families.

     *     Number of small and large businesses.

     *     School census data.

You can obtain these data by contacting the

     *     Municipal center or city planning office.

     *     United Way planning office.

     *     U.S. Census Bureau.

     *     Information office of your local school system.

Use this information to predict future needs for child care
services. For example, if the ages of a substantial number of
children range from infancy to six years, you can expect an
increased demand for school-age care in future years. If,
however, you find that a substantial number of children range
from twelve to fourteen years old, it may not make sense to open
a child care center in your immediate community. However, the
data may indicate that nearby communities do need new or
additional child care services.

Identifying Existing Services

To capture a niche in the market, you may have to offer services
that your competitors aren't offering or services they've
overlooked. For example, if several child care centers in your
community provide care for children from ages three to five only,
you may want to consider providing care for newborns, infants and
one- and two-year-old toddlers. Or, in addition to your daily
day-care services, you may want to provide after-school care for
children ages six to twelve.

When assessing what child care services are already available in
your community, ask the following questions:

     *     What type of care exists in the community?

     *     What age groups are being served -- infants, toddlers,
           preschool, school-age or combinations of the above?

     *     Are there age groups that need more care than others?

     *     What hours do the centers open and close?

     *     What types of services do they offer?

           --     Day care?

           --     Night care?

           --     Evening care?

           --     After-school care?

     *     How many centers are there?

     *     Where are the centers located?

     *     Is there a waiting list for child care services?

     *     Are more centers needed in the same area?

     *     What service can you provide that other centers aren't
           offering?

To obtain information on the child care programs in your
community,

     *     Contact the licensing office at the local municipal
           center.

     *     Contact the local day-care and referral agency.

     *     Look through the Yellow Pages.

     *     Contact the planning office for United Way or your 
           local government.

Whatever service you provide, make sure it responds to the
community's needs, is based on the children's interests and
promotes their intellectual, social, emotional and physical
development. Remember, review all the options before deciding on
the service(s) you plan to provide.

IDENTIFYING YOUR REASONS FOR GOING INTO BUSINESS

Planning and operating a child care center will consume much of
your time and energy. So it is important that you assess your
motivations, personality, skills and experience and ability to
manage time to determine if you are the right person for the job.

Motivations

As a first and often overlooked step, ask yourself why you want
to go into business. Check the reasons that apply to you.

                                                             YES
1.   You desire freedom from the 9-5 daily routine.         _____

2.   You want to be your own boss.                          _____

3.   You want to improve your standard of living.           _____

4.   You are bored with your present job.                   _____

5.   You can't find a job you like.                         _____

6.   There is a demand for your service.                    _____

7.   Owning your own business would be the culmination of
     your hopes and plans.                                  _____

8.   Owning your own business is something you've always 
     wanted to do.                                          _____

Some reasons are better than others; however, none are wrong.
Just remember, there are tradeoffs. For example, you can escape
the 9-5 routine, but you may replace it with a 6:00 AM to 8:00 PM
routine or a schedule with little, if any, free time.

Personality -- Self-assessment Questionnaire

There are certain personal characteristics you will need to go
into business. This self-assessment questionnaire will help you
identify your strengths and weaknesses; it will either eliminate
or justify any doubts you may have about becoming a child care
provider. Try to be objective your future depends on the decision
you make. Circle your choice in each statement.

1.    My health is excellent/good/poor.

2.    I am/am not a leader.

3.    As a problem solver, I am good/average/poor.

4.    I do/do not get along well with others.

5.    I take directions very well/well/reluctantly.

6.    I take the initiative always/usually/sometimes/ seldom/
      never.

7.    I work better alone/under supervision/with a group.

8.    My ability to handle emergencies is excellent/good/
      average/poor.

9.    My financial assets are limited/fair/sufficient for a year.

10.   My organizational and record-keeping skills are above
      average/average/marginal/below average.

11.   My business experience has been limited to selling/
      managerial/primarily bookkeeping and secretarial/varied
      and long.

12.   I am/am not generally warm and affectionate.

13.   I enjoy working with children all of the time/most of time/
      occasionally/never.

14.   I am/am not able to guide and discipline children kindly
      and effectively.

15.   I do/do not accept children as they are and feel a deep
      commitment to them and to their parents.

If you are in excellent physical health, are a good problem
solver, usually take the initiative, are a risk taker and feel
confident in making decisions, then you probably will be
comfortable managing a business. If you have sufficient cash to
operate through the critical first year (or feel confident you
can raise the money), are willing to work long hours at
relatively low pay and believe you possess the necessary skills,
you have a chance to succeed.

Skills and Experience

It is unlikely that you possess all the skills and experience to
succeed in a child care business. You can hire people to provide
the skills you lack. But there are some basic skills you'll need.
The following questions will help you identify the skills you do
possess.

                                                       YES   NO
1.    Do you know what basic skills you'll need to
      operate a successful child care program?        _____ _____

2.    Do you possess these skills?                    _____ _____

3.    Do you have any business experience?            _____ _____

4.    Have you ever worked as a director or manager?  _____ _____

5.    Have you reared children of your own?           _____ _____

6.    Do you have any child care experience?          _____ _____

7.    Is responsibility new to you?                   _____ _____

8.    Are you willing to work long hours if necessary?_____ _____

9.    Are immediate profits or covering costs 
      important to you?                               _____ _____

10.   When hiring personnel,, will you be able to 
      determine if the applicant's skills meet the 
      requirements for the position you are filling?  _____ _____

Time Management

Since operating a child care center will consume much of your
time, you may discover that you don't have enough time to perform
your usual daily tasks. Even in an office setting, it is very
difficult for some people to make and keep work schedules. As
your own boss, the problem can be much greater. To determine the
amount of time you will need to devote to your business, draft a
weekly timetable listing all current and potential
responsibilities and the time required for each.
_________________________________________________________________

PREPARING FOR BUSINESS

Preparing for opening your business is a critical step.
Appendix A provides an outline for forming your business plan. In
addition, the following sections describe certain aspects of your
preparation in detail.

Name and Legal Structure

Choosing a name and legal structure for your center is important,
especially if you plan to borrow money to start your business.
Many entrepreneurs don't consider these points until the
questions appear on the loan or licensing applications.

Select a name that's catchy and easy to remember. Consider your
family's and friends' ideas as well as your own.

Think carefully before deciding on the legal structure for your
center. Most child care centers are operated by sole proprietors.
However, you may find that incorporating or forming a partnership
offers more advantages. Consider the following points when
choosing the legal structure for your center:

     *     Sole proprietorship -- The owner is the business. You
           must file business and personal tax returns at the
           same time.

           --  Advantages -- Simple and inexpensive.

           --  Disadvantages -- Personal legal liability.

     *     Incorporation -- A likely choice for businesses with
           employees or bank financing. Attorney's and other fees
           range from $500 to $1,000.

           -- Advantages -- Credibility and personal assets are
              protected if the business fails or is sued.

           -- Disadvantages -- Taxes are potentially higher than
              for a sole proprietorship.

     *     Partnership -- A legal mechanism that divides profits
           and losses between participants. Partnerships are 
           governed by the law of the jurisdiction in which they
           are formed.

           --  Advantages -- To protect each partner and ensure
               effective management of the business, partners
               should enter into an agreement that sets forth 
               their respective rights and responsibilities.

               + Allows some businesses greater financial
                 resources.

               + Allows individuals with complementary skills to
                 participate in managing the business.

           --  Disadvantages -- Each partner is personally liable
               for the partnership's debts.

License Requirements

Before starting your child care center, know the many regulatory
systems that will affect your program. Most states require that
child care centers be licensed. Some cities and counties may have
additional licensing requirements, such as health regulations,
safety codes, fire inspections and zoning laws. Violating these
codes can result in a fine and/or suspension of your license.

Licensing requirements vary from state to state, but most include
the following:

     *     Physical space

           --  Number of square feet needed per child both 
               indoors and outdoors, depending on the children's
               ages.

           --  Lighting, heating/air-conditioning, ventilation 
               and plumbing requirements.

     *     Health requirements

           --  Possible annual medical examinations for staff and
               for children.

           --  Immunization records. (Even if they aren't 
               required, it's an important safeguard to 
               consider.)

     *     Staff-child ratios -- The minimum number of adults
           required for a given number of children, depending on
           their ages. Some states also regulate the maximum size
           of groups of children, in addition to specifying 
           minimum qualifications for staff.

     *     Food preparation and nutrition

     *     Emergency procedures

     *     Educational program requirements

     *     Record keeping

     *     Discipline

     *     Building safety -- Type of construction, number of
           exits, fire doors.

     *     Sanitation (health) requirements

           --  Plumbing.

           --  Food preparation and equipment.

           --  Adequate ventilation in bathroom(s) and
               classroom(s).

     *     Fire regulations (life safety code)

           --  Posted fire drill procedures.

           --  Fencing requirements.

           --  Type of neighborhood in which small businesses may
               be located.

     *     Zoning regulations-- Check with the local government
           and with any property owners' or homeowners'
           associations to find out if the type of child care
           services you are planning to provide is permitted or 
           if there are restrictions. There may be a local child
           care advocacy group or professional association that 
           can answer your questions and help you with zoning
           problems.

The following outline briefly identifies the steps involved in
obtaining an operating license. More details are contained in the
licensing regulations.

     1.   Obtain a copy of the licensing regulations from the 
          state licensing office. Read them carefully.

     2.   Arrange a meeting with licensing specialists. Go over
          the regulations and procedures for obtaining your
          license. Also arrange for them to visit your center.

     3.   Contact inspectors for building, sanitation, fire and
          zoning codes and arrange for them to visit your center.
          Remember, even if your center is in your home, you will
          have to meet certain requirements.

     4.   Once you have fulfilled all the requirements, fill out
          and submit your licensing application.
_________________________________________________________________

FINDING A LOCATION

The cost of the center itself, especially for a location outside
your home, will be one of your major start-up expenses. Many
child care providers operate from their homes, but you may want
to build, buy or rent space for your center.

Operating a Center Outside Your Home

Finding adequate space and the right location requires money,
time and thought. Look for space that is accessible and will
require few, if any, repairs. Sources of information on possible
locations include

     *     Classified real estate advertisements

           --  Homes for rent or sale.

           --  Apartments for rent or sale.

           --  Condominiums for rent or sale.

           --  Boarded-up space.

     *     Local churches/synagogues

           --  Ask ministers/rabbis/priests if they have space
               they would donate or offer at a reduced rate.

           --  Ask superintendents if there are any empty school
               buildings.

           --  Ask hospital administrators if they have space to
               rent or donate.

     *     Local industry

           --  Ask public relations offices if they have space 
               to rent or donate.

           --  Approach commercial contractors about new 
               commercial and residential space.

           --  Ask local government officials about space in 
               their buildings for donation or rent.

     *     Property management companies -- Find out if there is
           any space in office buildings.

As you look at possible locations, consider the following
questions:

      1.   Does it meet licensing requirements?

      2.   Does it meet building, sanitation and fire codes for
           day-care centers? If not, what has to be done and how
           much will it cost?

      3.   Is the area zoned for day care?

      4.   Is the location convenient for parents?

      5.   Is public transportation available?

      6.   Is there adequate fire and police protection?

      7.   Is crime insurance necessary and available at a
           reasonable rate?

      8.   Is the area safe?

      9.   Can the space provide separate areas for different
           activities?

      10.  Does it have outdoor space or is a playground nearby?

      11.  Does it have kitchen and adequate bathroom facilities
           for both children and adults?

      12.  If you will be sharing the space (with a church or
           school, for example), will you have to move equipment
           before others can use the space?

      13.  Can you afford it?

      14.  What were the utility bills last year?

If you are not building your own center, in most cases some
changes will be needed. Renovation can involve projects ranging
from painting to rewiring or major plumbing, which often become
very expensive. Sometimes you can negotiate with your landlord
that he or she perform major renovations in return for a
corresponding increase in your rent.

When you think you've found the right location, ask your
licensing specialist to inspect it. If renovation is needed, the
specialist will often be able to give a cost estimate or direct
you to someone who can. Be sure you do this before signing a
lease or purchase agreement.

Whether you draw up your own lease or are given a lease to sign,
responsibility for the building must be clear to both you and the
landlord. This is also true if you are purchasing a building.
Your lawyer should review and explain all the conditions of the
lease or contract to you before you sign.

Remember, a lease should include

     *     Specifications for the space to be used and exactly 
           when it will be used.

     *     How and when rent is to be paid.

     *     Who is responsible for maintenance, repair, insurance,
           extermination and garbage and snow removal, if 
           required.

     *     Who will pay increases in real estate taxes.

     *     Who will be responsible for obtaining official 
           permits, if required.

     *     Whether an option to renew is available.

Occupancy (space) costs include utilities, maintenance and repair
expenses and insurance. To help estimate these expenses, do some
preliminary research.

     *     Utilities -- Project utility costs based on last 
           year's costs plus inflation. If a deposit is required
           for opening a utility account, how much will it be? 
           Will your account be based on commercial (business)
           rates or private home rates?

     *    Maintenance and repair -- Such expenses can include

          --  Plumbing, wiring, roofing and outside and inside
              walls.

          --  Cleaning supplies and equipment.

          --  Snow removal, if required.

          --  Trash removal.

          --  Lawn mowing.

          --  Insect control.

     *    Insurance -- Do you need liability or fire and theft
          insurance? A fidelity bond?

These are a few of the items you will need to consider. As you
think of other items, write them down on a checklist.

Operating a Center from Your Home

Operating a child care center outside your home is very costly,
and may not be financially feasible for most child care
providers. As a matter of fact, many very successful child care
centers are located in the homes of the providers. The advantages
of operating a center from your home are

     *     Fewer expenses.

     *     Convenience for the provider and generally for the
           parents.

     *     Lower overhead.

     *     More flexible hours.

     *     Proximity for provider to his or her family.

There are, however, certain safety regulations that may require
changes to the rooms you will be using. Before you renovate and
after you finish, have the licensing specialist and building
inspector visit your home. Their suggestions and recommendations
can save you money.

You also are required to have adequate insurance protection for
the center. If you don't have them already, you will need fire
and theft insurance for your home. If you have insurance, make
sure your policy covers the supplies and equipment that you
purchase. You will also have to purchase liability insurance to
protect your center, staff and children. More detailed
information on insurance is provided in the insurance section.

TAX LAWS

Licensed child care providers, like all business owners, are
required to meet certain tax obligations, such as paying federal
and state taxes. The legal structure of the business will
determine the amount of taxes you will pay and the forms you will
use.

Reporting business taxes can be a very complicated, tricky
matter. This section is not intended as a substitute for advice
by a tax specialist, nor does it list all the forms that must be
filed by each entity. For additional information on these and
other forms, and to avoid costly errors, contact a tax specialist
or the IRS.

Sole Proprietorship

Each year, you will use Schedule C of the basic Form 1040
Individual Tax Return for reporting your business income and
expenses. Good record keeping is essential for filling out these
forms.

Income

Keep a ledger of all money you are paid for child care, whether
in cash or by check. Record each payment, especially cash,
immediately to avoid overlooking a payment and causing a
bookkeeping error. Your ledger should include

     *     Clients' names.

     *     Date of each payment.

     *     Period covered by the payment.

     *     Amount paid.

     *     Receipt number.

Payments should be deposited in your bank account and funds for
daily operations should be withdrawn by check only. It may be a
good idea to open a separate bank account for your business. This
makes it easier to monitor business income and expenditures and
will certainly make reporting your business taxes easier.

Expenses

All payments that you make for the center, whether by cash or by
check, are business expenses. To maintain adequate records of
these expenses, always save your receipts. The better your
records, the easier it will be to complete your tax forms at the
end of the year.

Certain items may qualify as a tax deduction if these purchases
are made solely for your center:

     *     Toys and activity supplies.

     *     Food for the children in your care.

     *     Playground equipment.

     *     Wages for assistants or substitutes.

     *     Advertising.

     *     Legal and professional services for your business.

     *     Office and record-keeping supplies.

     *     Insurance for your business.

     *     Child care-related travel (a set rate per mile; the
           allowable amount will vary according to your 
           location).

     *     Typewriter and/or computer.

     *     Utilities.

Depreciation.

Expenses that benefit both your center and your family will not
ordinarily qualify as a tax deduction. But tax regulations do
permit you to write off any specific area of your home used
strictly for business purposes.

Other forms that you may need to comply with federal regulations
are

      1.  Schedule SE Social Security or Self-Employment Tax.

      2.  Form 4562 Depreciation.

      3.  Form W-2 Wage Statement.

      4.  Form 1040ES Federal Estimated Tax Payments and State
          Estimated Tax Payments.

      5.  Schedule C, Form 1040 -- Individual Tax Return.

Corporation

A corporation's taxable income reflects deductions for costs of
doing business. Corporations are taxed on a graduated scale, with
the minimum rate being 34 percent. Form 1120 is used to report
the annual income of the corporation.

Items deductible under proprietorships are also deductible for
corporations. However, if you operate a child care center in your
home, certain items are deductible only to the extent that such
costs relate to the operation of the center. These items include

     *     Heat, water and electricity.

     *     Costs of staff salaries unless they are unreasonably
           high.

     *     Depreciation, which is deducted in computing taxable
           income.

Distribution of profits to shareholders, made through dividends,
is not deductible by the corporation. However, these dividends
are subject to double taxation in that they are not deductible by
the corporation (i.e., they are paid with after-tax dollars) and
shareholders are taxed on receipt of dividend distributions.

Partnership

A partnership is a pass-through entity because the partnership
itself pays no tax but the income is passed on to each individual
partner. Each year the partnership must file an annual
information return, Form 1065, Section 6031(a), with the IRS. In
addition it must prepare Form K-1, Section 6031(b), which spells
out each partner's share of profits, gains, losses, deductions
and credits. These amounts are reported on each partner's tax
return.

S-Corporation

S-corporations are hybrid entities with characteristics of both
corporations and partnerships. They do not pay taxes but must
file annual information returns and prepare statements showing
income, gain, loss, deduction or credit allocated to each
shareholder for the taxable year. These amounts are reported on
the shareholder's tax return (Form 1040 Schedule C for an
individual).

Tax-exempt Center

To qualify for certain federally funded programs, you will have
to establish a nonprofit center, which will make you eligible for
tax-exempt status. In a nonprofit organization, any money left
after expenses is returned to the operation of the center (e.g.,
salaries, remodeling, etc.). You must, however, file an
application and meet IRS eligibility requirements to claim this
status.

Some of the advantages of tax-exempt status are

     *     State sales taxes do not have to be paid.

     *     Contributions to the center are tax deductible for any
           donor, whether made by an individual or a foundation.

     *     Grants are easier to obtain from both private and 
           public sources.

To qualify for tax-exempt status, incorporation is necessary. The
process for incorporation varies widely in each state, but
generally requires that bylaws be written and a board of
directors elected. Information on incorporation can usually be
obtained from the secretary of state's office or the department
of corporation. A small fee is usually required.

Once you have filed your articles of incorporation and fulfilled
all other state requirements, you can file for tax-exempt status.
Remember, even with federal tax exemption, you are still required
to pay state taxes. To receive state exemption, you must file
with the appropriate state agency. The state, however, will not
give an exemption until the federal exemption has been granted.

Before deciding to operate as a nonprofit organization, contact a
lawyer. Sound legal advice will help you make the right decision.

INSURANCE

Starting and operating a business involves a degree of risk. It
is important to have adequate insurance protection for your
business. If you aren't exactly sure what type of insurance is
best, discuss coverage and rates with several insurance agents
before making a final decision.

Insurance coverage varies from state to state, but there are
several types of insurance available for child care providers.
Liability and accident insurance are considered essential.

Liability

A provider is liable and can be sued in court for any accident
occurring because of alleged negligence or failure to exercise
reasonable care. You, your employee(s), your home or your
property can be found negligent.

Liability insurance for a child care program generally covers
most injuries that may occur. Under such a policy, the insurance
company will defend you if you are sued. If the court decides
that you are liable (meaning your negligence caused the child's
injury and, therefore, you should pay compensation), the company
will pay the cost of the judgment up to the limits of the policy.
Several states require that providers carry liability insurance,
at least in some situations, and many others strongly advise it.
To find out about your state's regulations, contact the local
office that licenses or registers family day care or call a
providers' organization.

Most general liability policies cover four basic types of costs:

      *     Bodily or personal injury.

      *     Damage to others' property.

      *     Immediate medical relief at the time of an accident.

      *     The legal costs to defend you in a lawsuit.

Other areas for possible coverage are

      *     Transporting children.

      *     Accidents in which no one is at fault.

      *     Defense costs in the event of physical/sexual abuse.

      *     Damage to your property.

Liability coverage is offered on one of two bases: (1) claims
made and (2) occurrence. With claims-made policies, you are
covered only for incidents that are reported during the time your
policy is in force. Occurrence insurance covers you for incidents
that occur during the time your policy is in force.

Liability insurance is expensive, but there are several
precautions you can take to reduce the chance of accidents
occurring.

      *     Child proof every room where the children will be;
            imagine any possible accident and prevent it.

      *     Take first aid and CPR (cardiopulmonary 
            resuscitation) courses (call your local Red Cross for
            information).

      *     Learn to keep an eye on all the children.

      *     Keep walkways, stairs and sidewalks clean.

      *     Avoid fire hazards.

      *     Choose responsible assistants and substitutes.

      *     Develop clear health and safety policies.

      *     Encourage parents to visit any time and give them 
           your written policies.

You will find that these and other policies will make your center
safer. For additional information on the different types of
liability insurance, contact your insurance agent.

Accident

For a small cost, you can buy accident insurance to supplement
your family's medical insurance if a child or employee is
injured. Talk to an agent or broker before deciding on the
coverage.

FINANCING YOUR BUSINESS

Many excellent ideas that could develop into profitable business
ventures never get underway or fail because of inadequate funding
to start the business. Getting funding for your business can pose
a problem, especially if you don't know where to go or whom to
see. There are many sources for financing your center. However,
that financing depends on whether you are beginning a nonprofit
or for-profit organization.

While public funding is seldom available for start-up, there are
several different sources of loans and grants for which you can
apply. These sources of financing can be divided into six
categories: private sources, venture capitalists, commercial
banks, government agencies, grant programs and other sources.

Of these sources, venture capitalists are the most unlikely to
finance your center; they tend to invest in growth firms rather
than start-up businesses because of the significant long-term
capital appreciation and the high yields generated on investment
returns.

Private Sources

Private sources include your own savings or funds from friends or
relatives, and are among the most common methods of financing.

The advantages of using your own money are (1) there are no
finance charges and (2) your search for additional funds is
minimized. The disadvantages are (1) you lose the interest you
could be earning on your money and (2) you lose the use of your
savings as a cushion for any future emergencies.

The advantages of borrowing from friends and relatives are
(1) they are less likely to make demands on your style of
management, (2) there is no legal limit on how much you can
borrow and (3) the terms of borrowing can be negotiated and
usually are more flexible than those of commercial sources. The
disadvantage centers on the problems that may arise if the money
isn't paid back on time.

Commercial Banks

All banks have a commercial division. Since the banking industry
was deregulated, many savings and loan associations also engage
in commercial banking. All commercial banks offer business
loans -- both short-term and long-term -- at prevailing interest
rates.

When applying for money from a bank or individual investor, show
a willingness to invest your own money. You must be willing to
risk your assets if you expect others to risk theirs. Banks will
require collateral to secure their loan against total loss in the
event of default. In other words, to obtain funding, the amount
of cash or other assets that you will need will depend on the
potential success and the level of risk of your business as
evaluated by the lender.

If you need a listing of commercial banks in your area, consult
the Yellow Pages or request a referral from a trade association,
management consultant, attorney, accountant, friend or relative.

Government Agencies

Federal, state and local government agencies offer special
financial assistance to small businesses. Many loan programs,
administered under government guidelines and funded by the
government, are available. Each program is designed to assist a
special type of business.

States provide financing through a variety of instruments, often
with restrictions imposed. Many instruments are similar to those
used by private sector sources, but they may incorporate public
policy objectives, such as job creation or tax revenue
enhancement. Such instruments are usually designed to ensure that
state funds are protected and that the proceeds are used for
productive, targeted purposes.

Loans can be extended directly by a state, through a
state-chartered corporation, or indirectly, through guaranteed
loans from commercial lenders. Typically, loans are used for
long-term capital needs, such as plant and equipment. Most states
require collateral, so that in the event of loan default the
state doesn't lose its entire investment. Interest rates may be
at the market rate or may be subsidized by the state. Most loans
require the borrower to satisfy certain criteria before a loan is
granted, such as showing qualified management, market potential
for the firm's product(s), sufficient collateral to secure the
loan and adequate cash flow from operations to service debt.

For an up-to-date list of loan programs and their requirements,
contact your local Small Business Administration (SBA) office
(for information on federal loan programs) or your state economic
development office (for information on state loans and grant
programs).

Grant Programs

Grants are sums of money provided to businesses without a
repayment obligation. They can be funded by federal or state
government agencies or by private foundations. Grants are
generally reserved for research and development and nonprofit
organizations; few for-profit businesses qualify for grant
programs.

You will have to submit a written proposal to the agency,
organization or foundation where you are applying for a grant. It
is a good idea when applying for a grant from private funding
sources to

      *     Call or visit their offices.

      *     Ask if they have special forms or guidelines for 
            submitting a proposal.

      *     Ask if there are any special requirements for
            applying, to be sure that you are eligible.

      *     Find out what their funding cycle is (some only give
            money at certain times of the year).

      *     Find out when applications are accepted and decisions
            made.

Your proposal should describe

      *     Purpose (why you want to start a day-care center).

      *     Goals (what kind of center you are proposing).

      *     Procedure (how you will start your business).

      *     Budget (how much it will cost to start and operate
            your center).

      *     Evaluation (how you will determine if your business 
            is meeting your purpose and objectives).

Once you have completed the proposal, review it to make sure you
have met the requirements, then submit it to the appropriate
office or officer. If your proposal is rejected, find out why.
Ask if there are changes that can be made in order for you to
resubmit the proposal. Sometimes sources are willing to fund only
a portion of your original request. Find out which parts they can
fund and resubmit for those parts.

Other Sources

Credit unions and life insurance companies also can be a source
of funds. Credit unions offer personal loans to members, usually
at interest rates lower than those of commercial banks. Insurance
companies will often loan money against a life insurance policy
for up to 95 percent of the policy value. Their interest rates
also are generally lower than those charged by commercial banks.
Interest payments may be deferred as long as your premium
payments are made. But until the loan is repaid, your coverage
will be reduced by the amount of the loan.

Whatever financial institution you approach, show a willingness
to risk your own money and have a business plan or proposal that
is well written, factual and well organized.
_________________________________________________________________

DEVELOPING A FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT PLAN

Having a sound financial management plan is paramount to the
success of any business. Each year, many small businesses,
including child care centers, fail because of poor financial
management.

If your operation is to succeed, you'll need a sound budget,
i.e., a plan that provides a realistic projection of actual
estimated expenses and income. Preparing both a start-up budget
and an operating budget will tell you what you will spend, now 
and in the future, and where the money will come from for 
starting and operating your center. Most important, these budgets
will indicate whether your projected income will meet your
expenses.

Start-up Budget

The first step to building a sound financial plan is a start-up
budget. This will usually include such one-time costs as major
equipment, renovation, utility deposits and down payments.
Additionally, your start-up budget should include at least 60 to
90 days of operating costs.

In estimating your costs, find out what it has cost other child
care centers (i.e., planned and unplanned expenses) to open over
the past two years and figure in the current inflation rate.
Table 1 will help you identify the items to include in your
start-up budget.

     _______________________________________________________

Operating Budget

Prepare an operating budget when your center actually opens. This
budget reflects your spending priorities, the expenses you will
incur and how you will meet those expenses. From the moment the
door to your new business opens, you will undoubtedly receive a
certain amount of income. Do not count on this income, however,
to cover operating expenses for the first 90 days.

As you estimate your expenses, the operators of other centers can
help you project your actual costs, particularly for such items
as telephone and supplies. 

Table 2 includes a sample operating budget to help you project
your annual operating expenses.

Monthly Operating Expenses

The primary source of income for your center will be fees. It is
important to determine if this income will be enough to pay each
month's bills. An estimated cash flow projection, such as the one
in Table 3, will help you make this determination. In this
sample, all income is generated by monthly tuition fees.

Also, be sure to complete a cash flow sheet for each month. This
will enable you to maintain an accurate record of business income
and expenditures for projection and tax purposes. If you are
operating your center from home, such a record is especially
important to keep track of in-home deductions (see page 8 under
Tax Laws).

Balancing Income and Expenses

Add your first-year operating costs and start-up costs to
determine how much money you will need from the time you decide
to open the center through the center's first year of operation.
When including parent fees as income, remember that most centers
do not have total enrollment until at least three months after
they have opened for operation, and some take several years.

After completing your projected expenses and revenues, determine
whether the expenses match the income. If not, you will need to
lower the costs or reevaluate your market. If you cannot raise
additional monies, decide where you can cut costs. For example,
can you reduce your program's supply costs by relying more on
recycled materials? Would such cuts help? You may be tempted to
cut salaries or fringe benefits since they consume a large part
of your costs. However, these are important in attracting and
maintaining a well-qualified staff. Also, reducing staff may
place you out of compliance with state licensing requirements and
your own standards of quality.

You may want to consider increasing fees or tuition in addition
to looking for other sources of revenue. Check your needs
assessment and determine what parents can afford to pay and what
seems to be the going rate at centers similar to yours. Be aware
of tax credits available to parents for day care, and contact
your local IRS office for the latest information on child care
tax credits. Some centers have a sliding fee scale, which means
that parents are charged different scales depending on their
income level and number of children. Remember, if you lower a fee
you have to make it up in other fees.

Fiscal Policies

Your budget should include fiscal policies. For example,
determine when the staff is to be paid (weekly, biweekly,
monthly), late fee payment policies for parents and tax
reporting. Bill parents on a weekly or monthly basis. Don't let
payments fall behind because the longer they are overdue, the
harder they are to collect. Decide whether to charge parents for
the days when a child is ill or on vacation or for holidays.
There may be other policies that you will think of, so write them
down and include them as part of the child care contract.

Audits

Audits play an important role in ensuring the sound financial
management of a business. A review of appropriate financial
records by an independent public accountant will determine
whether you have spent money according to your budget and have
met any requirements mandated by various funding sources as well
as state and federal regulations. An audit also provides you with
an accurate financial statement and recommendations to improve
your financial management. Many funding sources require a
financial statement or audit as a condition of future grants or
contracts. You should, therefore, budget for an audit or look for
an accountant who will do it for little or no charge. Contact
your local accounting association for accountants who can help
you.

Also, to ensure sound fiscal management of your center, contact
an accountant or an accounting firm to help you set up your
books. This help will be invaluable.

DEVELOPING A MARKETING PLAN

How you market your center may make the difference between its
success or failure. Like any other business, a child care center
provides a service that consumers want and are willing to
purchase. Therefore, you will have to sell your service to the
consumers (parents). Your marketing plan can help you achieve
this goal.

Know Your Customers

Knowing your customer is the key to successfully marketing your
center. The more you know about the parents' expectations, the
easier it will be to develop a program that meets their needs, as
well as the children's. The data collected in assessing your
community's needs will help you do this. Also, develop a list of
questions to help you identify what the parents will likely need,
want and expect of your center. Use the data collected in your
initial assessment and the survey to help answer those questions.

The questions may include

     1.   What type of service will be provided?

     2.   What are the operating hours?

     3.   Do the operating hours match the parents' work 
          schedule?

     4.   Is extended evening care available?

     5.   Where is the center located?

     6.   Is the location convenient and easily accessible?

     7.   How many staff members have degrees or training in 
          early childhood education or a related field?

     8.   What is the teacher-to-child ratio (e.g., one adult to
          seven children)?

     9.   Will there be a curriculum? Will it be structured?

     10.  Have you or will you devise an activities schedule?

     11.  How will the center be operated? Hours? Staffing?
          Activities? Fees?

     12.  Have medical/first aid policies been developed?

     13.  What will the sleeping arrangements be?

Once you have answered these questions, you will have a base from
which to develop your marketing plan.

The Marketing Program

Many first-time business owners think that simply placing an
advertisement in the local newspaper or a commercial on a local
radio or television station will make customers flock to purchase
their product or service. This is true to a certain extent, but
hundreds, even thousands, of other possible customers may never
learn of your business. Just think of the money you'll lose,
simply because you didn't develop an adequate marketing program.

There are certain factors you should consider when developing
your marketing strategy. These are called the five Ps of
marketing:

     *     Product/service -- The description of the product or
           service.

     *     Price -- An amount competitive within the market area.

     *     Place -- The description of the location, including 
           its advantages, such as adequate parking, good street
           lighting, easy access.

     *     Promotion -- The method of advertising or highlighting
           the business.

     *     Persuasion -- The ability to sell your services and
           the business to the surrounding community.

Each factor requires an investment in dollars, time and effort,
but the reward will be worth it. Devise a plan that uses
advertising and networking (word-of-mouth advertising) to promote
your center. Develop short, descriptive copy that clearly
identifies the services provided by your center, the price of
those services and the center's location. Use catchy phrases to
arouse the interest of your readers, listeners or viewers.
Remember, the more care and attention you devote to your
marketing program, the more successful your center will be.

Marketing Your Center

No matter what advertising media you use, you will have to spend
money, so allow for advertising expenses in your budget. There
are many ways to advertise your center, but keep in mind that
advertising costs vary with the medium used. Newspaper
advertisements and radio and television commercials are the most
expensive means of advertising. If you can afford to use one of
these media, talk to an advertising agency before making a final
decision. Once you've decided on the medium, get the agency to
help you design your advertisement or create a commercial.

Whatever advertising media you use, be sure to include the
following information:

      1.   Name, address and telephone number of the center.

      2.   Ages of children who will be accepted.

      3.   Hours the center will be open.

      4.   Fees charged.

      5.   A description of the program and the qualifications of
           the staff.

      6.   Whom to contact for more information.

      7.  Date you plan to open.

Start advertising your center at least three months before you
open for business. Make sure your advertisements are consistent
with the image you are trying to project.

To ensure the success of an advertising program, try to meet your
competition head on. Look at your competitors. In what sections
do they advertise? What size advertisements do they use?

Inexpensive Advertising Techniques

If you do not have the money to advertise by radio, television or
newspaper, don't be discouraged. There are other inexpensive yet
effective alternatives. A brief description of each follows.

     *     Fliers and brochures -- One inexpensive way to 
           advertise is to post fliers in public buildings, such
           as shopping centers, markets, laundromats, restaurants
           and community centers. Get permission from the 
           owner(s) or governing body (e.g., managers, board of
           directors) of these facilities before posting your
           fliers -- some public buildings prohibit solicitation.

           Distributing brochures is another good way to 
           advertise. Take brochures or fliers to employment
           offices, libraries, schools, personnel offices of
           businesses and industries, government agencies,
           hospitals, union headquarters or shops, women's 
           groups, colleges and universities, church groups
           and the parent-teacher associations (PTAs).

           To develop effective brochures and fliers, study
           written advertisements in the newspapers and 
           magazines; ask yourself which advertisements appeal to
           you and why and try to develop similar ones. If you
           know people in advertising or public relations, ask
           them to help you design your brochures and fliers,
           to avoid the cost of professional help.

      *    Business cards -- Business cards are an excellent,
           inexpensive way to advertise. Have business cards
           printed in lots of 1,000. Include your name, address
           and telephone number, the hours of your center and the
           ages of the children you'll care for. Ask parents,
           friends and relatives to pass them out to interested
           people at work. Take them along to pass out when you
           take the children on a field trip or a walk in the
           neighborhood. Anyone who works with families may be
           able to make referrals to you -- ministers or rabbis,
           school staff, pediatricians, parent groups and 
           business or civic organizations. Provide them with
           business cards, fliers or brochures on your center so
           they can knowledgeably talk to prospective clients.
 
      *    Referral agencies -- The number of child care referral
           agencies is growing. If you are licensed or 
           registered, you may be eligible to be listed for
           referrals by the licensing office and other referral   
           agencies in your community. Check the National 
           Directory of Child Care Information and Referral
           Agencies for the agency nearest you. (For this
           information, write to the California Child Care 
           Resource and Referral Network, 809 Lincoln Way, San
           Francisco, CA 94122.)

      *    Networking -- Perhaps one of the best ways to market
           your center is through networking. Since most parents
           choose their child's caregiver from word-of-mouth
           recommendations, talk about yourself and your program
           to people who might have the opportunity to recommend
           you. Volunteer to speak to local civic and church
           groups and to the PTA.

           Networking adds a credibility to your service that
           advertising can't. This is primarily because
           advertisements are designed to convince people to
           purchase a certain product or service at any cost 
           while word-of-mouth referrals are based on an
           individual's satisfaction with a product or service.
           Since most people value their family's and friends'
           judgment more than an advertisement, they will more
           likely choose your center if it is so recommended.

           Remember, word-of-mouth advertising depends on the
           quality of your program. If parents are pleased with
           the way their children are thriving at your center,
           they will tell their friends. Good providers in clean,
           safe and appealing centers are in high demand almost
           everywhere.

           Yellow Pages -- Directory advertising is completely
           different from other forms of advertising. It is for
           people who are ready to buy. Other media deliver
           readers, viewers or listeners; directories deliver
           buyers. Include as much information as possible in  
           your directory advertisement as people frequently make
           decisions based on the information in directories.
 
           As with any print media, be sure your entire market is
           covered by the intended directory with minimal waste.

     *     Classified ads -- Place an advertisement in the
           classified section of your local newspaper. Announce
           your opening in the business section as well as other
           feature sections. Many people read the business and
           classified sections of the newspaper during their
           commute to and from work. Placing an advertisement in
           these sections increases your clientele base.

Know the Competition

A cardinal rule of effective marketing is to know your
competitors. Assess their operations and find a way to beat them.
Many entrepreneurs mistakenly believe that their competitors
consist solely of firms that offer similar services or products
in the same geographic area. However, they may also include any
business vying for the same clients.

Your estimate of competitors should include all those who offer
related services. They may be in the same geographic area or
another area that is accessible to your clients. To determine the
competitiveness of your market, find out

      1.   What businesses offer child care service.

      2.   Who your major competitors are, both direct and 
           indirect (e.g., child care centers accessible to your
           clientele).

      3.   How long your competitors have been in business.

      4.   How your center will benefit the clients more than 
           your competitors' centers.

      5.   If there is a need for additional centers in your area
           or in an area that is easily accessible?

      6.   How competitors' centers are similar to or different
           from yours.

      7.   What your competitors' strengths and weaknesses are.

      8.   How competitors' businesses are faring.

      9.   How competitors will act when you enter the market.

      10.  What competitors' managerial abilities, financial
           situations, facilities, reputations, etc. are.

Financial institutions and investors often place heavy emphasis
on potential competition when deciding to fund a new business.
Whether or not you apply for a loan to finance your center, it is
good to know as much as possible about your competitors.

Sources of Market Information

There are several sources of market information. They include

     *     Market research consultants and advertising firms.

     *     Colleges and universities.

     *     Your own research.

     *     Other sources, such as the Yellow Pages or industrial
           directories.

Market Research Consultants and Advertising Firms

Market research consultants are professionals who complete market
survey reports. They can also help you develop a marketing plan.
Most advertising firms also have a market research department
that can help you develop survey questionnaires and analyze and
interpret the data. The drawback to using a professional
consulting and advertising firm is the cost.

Try to find a consultant or advertiser who will analyze and
interpret the data and help you develop a marketing plan for a
nominal fee.

Colleges and Universities

Business schools in local colleges and universities often have
professional and student groups that offer consulting services.
They can help you with a market survey and a marketing plan, as
well as with problem areas. Student services, however, may be
available only during the academic year. It is important that you
approach these services with well-defined needs and be prepared
to actively participate as the project progresses. Contact local
colleges or universities for additional information.

Many colleges and universities are involved with an
SBA-affiliated program called the Small Business Institute (SBI).
SBIs provide many services, including market analysis. If you
need help analyzing the market and interpreting survey data,
contact the local SBA office for information on the nearest SBI
program.

Your Own Research

You may choose to conduct your own market analysis. Most market
research is time consuming, and the techniques can sometimes be
quite sophisticated. Even if you do not have the time or the
skills needed, you can still conduct simple research that can
yield a tremendous amount of information. This technique is
called focused group interviews.

First, from your personal knowledge, put down some facts about
your market. Then assemble a small group of acquaintances,
friends or relatives who represent a good cross section of the
client group you are hoping to serve. Describe your center and
the service you plan to provide. Ask for feedback. Use this
information to determine if your idea is feasible and if your
center will be accepted. A marketing or advertising specialist
can help you set up these groups.

Other Sources

Your local library is usually a gold mine of information. Many
publications, such as government reports, contain valuable
up-to-date information. If you have any questions, the reference
librarian is trained to find the information. Do not hesitate to
ask for help.

DEVELOPING A MANAGEMENT PLAN

Like the marketing program, your management system will help set
the foundation and ultimate plan for your business. Planning and
developing a program that adequately manages your center is very
important. There are many factors that you must consider, such as
finding and hiring qualified staff, determining staff size,
setting working hours, deciding on staff responsibilities,
establishing salaries and fringe benefits and developing
personnel policies.

Since it is unlikely that you will have all the skills needed to
effectively manage your center, you will have to hire personnel
who have the skills you lack.

Finding and Hiring Staff

Your staff is a reflection of your program philosophy and goals.
The members' quality and performance are critical to the success
of your center. Many factors will influence your hiring
decisions. Some of these points have been discussed in earlier
sections. They include

     *     Your goals and objectives.

     *     Licensing regulations concerning staff-child ratios 
           and group size.

     *     Needs assessment surveys that assisted you in
           determining the age group of the children to be cared
           for and what kinds of experience parents wish for 
           their children.

Hiring Procedures

It is important to establish hiring procedures. If you used a
parent group to assist you with your needs assessment, you might
want to include them when you hire. They can offer invaluable
advice on hiring qualified staff who will satisfy your and their
needs.

Some steps in the hiring process include

      1.   Establish criteria for selecting your staff. Working
           with children involves enhancing their social,
           intellectual, emotional and physical development. 
           Major considerations in a candidate are his or her
           personal qualities; attitude toward child care,
           children and parents; previous applicable employment
           and education or other special training. Having the
           necessary qualities and skills to fulfill the job
           description is, of course, also important.To give you
           an idea of what to look for when selecting teachers 
           for your center, sample curriculums for the 
           Associate's, Bachelor's and Master's programs in early
           childhood education are included in Appendix C.

      2.   Establish a time frame. Remember, you will need time
           to advertise, interview and make selections, and some
           individuals may have to give notice to present
           employers, so it is wise to begin the hiring process
           at least 60 days in advance.

      3.   Advertise for employees.

      4.   Review resumes based on your criteria.

      5.   Telephone any promising applicants for an interview.
           Screen to be sure they meet your criteria.

      6.   Have candidates fill out application forms.

      7.   Conduct interviews (if possible, observe candidate with
           children).

      8.   Contact references.

      9.   Review and make your decision.

      10.  Notify candidates of your decision, even those you do
           not hire.

Each advertisement should include a job title, brief job
description, qualifications, deadline for applications, request
for resume, telephone number or address and whom to contact.
Remember, the more qualified your staff, the more effective your
program will be at meeting the needs of the parents and children.

Determining Staff Size

The size of your staff will depend on how many children you plan
to care for, state licensing regulations and the quality of the
program you plan to provide.

States establish minimum guidelines for the number of staff
needed in a child care center, depending on the age of the
children. You may choose to exceed these minimum requirements.

Research has shown that for three to five year olds, groups of
14-18 children work well. Infants should be in much smaller
groups than that, and school-age children may be in slightly
larger groups.

In addition to your regular staff (those caring for the
children), you will need to make decisions regarding other
personnel who, although not working directly with the children,
are necessary to maintain a smoothly operating center (e.g., a
cook if you are preparing food at the center, a secretary, a
bookkeeper and a custodian). Substitute staff will be necessary
for days when regular staff and volunteers are ill, on vacation
or in training.

Setting Working Hours

As you decide on the number of staff you will need, also plan the
hours they will work at the center. Most centers are open 10 to
12 hours daily. However, the kind of service you plan to provide
will determine your center's hours.

Working with children is emotionally and physically demanding.
Staff tend to be less effective after six hours. If you require
eight hour shifts, staff are entitled by law to lunch breaks and
coffee breaks, the latter usually once in the morning and once in
the afternoon.

Developing a staff schedule depends on how many children are
present at different times of the day. Children do not all come
or leave at the same time.

Deciding on Staff Responsibilities

Job responsibilities depend on job descriptions, the authority
each person has in line with his or her responsibilities, how it
will be determined whether those responsibilities have been met
and who will supervise whom. Job descriptions must be written for
all staff members, including you.

To help you develop job descriptions, contact

     *     Your licensing agent.

     *     Agencies that assist people in determining their 
           skills (e.g., Displaced Homemakers, Urban League, 
           YWCA, etc.).

     *     Child care resource and information referral centers.

     *     Child care associations.

Establishing Salaries and Fringe Benefits

To maintain a consistent, qualified staff, you must offer
competitive salaries and fringe benefits. Some fringe benefits to
consider are

     *     Payment of social security (optional for nonprofit
           organizations).

     *     Health insurance.

     *     Workers' compensation (mandatory).

     *     Vacation leave.

     *     Sick leave.

     *     Personal leave.

     *     Paid maternity/paternity leave.

     *     Paid training at workshops, conferences or colleges.

     *     Retirement plan.

     *     Professional days.

The same people available to help you with job descriptions can
also help you make decisions concerning salaries and fringe
benefits.

Personnel Policies

A written personnel policy is your outline of operating
procedures for staff members. It details what they can expect and
what is available to them as employees of your center. Clearly
stated, policies help avoid misunderstandings and
misinterpretations.

Personnel policies generally include

     *     Job descriptions.

     *     Salary ranges from lowest to highest level for any one
           position.

     *     Benefits.

     *     Hiring and terminating procedures.

     *     Evaluation procedures.

     *     Grievance procedures.

     *     Sick and vacation leave.

Legal Aspects

You must become familiar with many laws when others are working
for you. These laws regulate

     *     Withholding tax (federal income tax) -- Check with the
           IRS.

     *     State or municipal income tax -- Ask your bank whom to
           contact.

     *     Workers' compensation -- Contact your state agency or
           an insurance company.

     *     Social security (FICA) -- Contact your local social
           security office.

     *     Unemployment insurance -- Contact your state 
           employment security agency.

These laws and regulations constantly change so it is important
to keep abreast of them. For more information, contact the IRS or
a lawyer.

Volunteer Staff

In addition to some paid staff, many centers use volunteers to
meet licensing requirements. Volunteers can offer special
activities that centers could not otherwise afford to give
children and their families. They can serve as teachers, teacher
aides, secretaries and bookkeepers. Many volunteers are skilled
in story telling, dance, art and music. Parents may have skills
in nursing, accounting or law and may want to serve as volunteers
as a way to reduce tuition fees.

If you decide to use volunteers, be very specific about when they
will work. Describe their duties, so they know to whom they are
to report and the person to notify if they will be absent. There
are risks in using volunteers to maintain your staff-child ratio.
If a volunteer does not show up, you could be in violation of
state regulations.

You may find volunteers at

     *     Colleges and universities (student teachers, students
           in art, music, athletics).

     *     Fraternities and/or sororities.

     *     Girl Scouts and/or Boy Scouts.

     *     Junior League.

     *     Foster grandparent programs.

     *     Senior citizen groups.

     *     Armed forces bases.

     *     Training programs such as early childhood development
           classes.

PREPARING THE CENTER

Before you start caring for children, it is wise to transform
your center (i.e., your home or location outside your home) into
a place that is safe, clean, comfortable and inviting to parents
and children alike. There are a number of measures that you can
take; each is described below.

Safety

You must be confident that all areas the children will use --
indoors and outdoors -- are safe. To check, you might want to 
crawl around on your hands and knees, asking, What could a child
possibly get into here? How might a child be hurt here? What 
other problems could be caused here? Make sure

     *     All items children should not use are safely locked
           away or on high, inaccessible shelves.

     *     Precious breakables are put away.

     *     Poisonous plants are out of reach.

     *     Stairs are well lighted and secure underfoot.

     *     Chemicals, medicines and other dangerous items are
           behind safety locks.

     *     Toys are stored on shelves to avoid injury from 
           falling lids on toy boxes.

All play materials, furniture, shelving, outdoor equipment --
everything with which children will come into contact -- should 
be checked every few days for loose parts or any safety hazard.
Broken toys and missing pieces discourage play and should be 
fixed, put away or discarded. A doll with a missing limb could be
tenderly cared for, and perhaps bandaged or fitted with a pretend
artificial limb during hospital play. If beyond repair, some 
broken equipment can be dissected by the children to see what is
inside before it is thrown away.

Sometimes parents are willing to build and repair equipment to
keep costs down. Or a parent can be given a discount for helping
with these tasks. Occasionally one or more parents may be willing
to build shelves, a backyard climber or a child-size picnic
table.

Be aware that, while garage sales are often a source of
first-rate toys and equipment at bargain prices, older model
cribs and other items may not meet current safety standards.

Equipment and Materials

The equipment and materials you will need depend on the ages of
the children you care for. Here is a list of ideal equipment and
materials for a center serving a wide age range of children:

     *     Child-size tables and chairs, booster seats, high 
           chairs and infant seats. Tables can be used for eating
           and for a variety of children's activities.

     *     Cribs, beds, cots, all with protective mattress pads
           covered with plastic that can be stored under the 
           beds; blankets and sheets for each child. If you use
           your family's beds, lay the children's bedding on top
           of the made-up bed.

     *     Diapering area (preferably near a faucet) that can be
           easily sanitized after each use; nearby childproof,
           sanitary storage for used diapers; step stools for 
           sink and toilet.

     *     Space -- to crawl, toddle, run, climb and to be alone
           (but still in view).

     *     Outdoor play space (sand, hard surface for wheeled 
           toys, swings, climber, garden) or a nearby park. A
           covered porch or carport is ideal for rainy days.

     *     Art materials, such as meat trays, egg cartons, 
           computer paper; washable surfaces for messy 
           activities.

     *     Water and sand to scoop and pour into plastic dishpans
           or a larger trough or water table; old throw rugs or
           other absorbent floor covering.

     *     Large and small, simple and complicated toys, 
           including building materials such as wooden and 
           plastic blocks.

     *     Good children's books and a quiet, cuddly place to
           read them.

     *     Paperback books can be covered with clean adhesive
           plastic to protect and strengthen them.

     *     Games, puzzles, dolls, vehicles (child powered rather
           than battery powered).

     *     Make-believe props, clothes and costumes for dressing
           up and pretending.

     *     Record player, tape recorder and radio; number,
           alphabet and color charts or cards; canister for
           crayons, pencils and other miscellaneous art 
           materials.

      *    A fabric carrier for young babies and a backpack 
           carrier for babies who can sit up. Many babies love
           swings and bouncing chairs.

      *    For older children, a private place with props and
           equipment that children can rearrange as they choose.
           School-age children will also need a place to keep 
           their things from school and perhaps a place to do 
           their homework.

For suggestions on specific toys for different age groups, call
the National Association for the Education of Young Children
(NAEYC) at 202-232-8777 or 800-424-2460 or write to NAEYC, 1834
Connecticut Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20009-5786.

You do not need to spend a lot of money on toys and equipment if
you set up your center creatively. Your warmth and enthusiasm
will be your best asset.

Setup

Your center should be arranged so children can play happily with
each other and by themselves, participate in a structured
curriculum (if provided) and experience their growing
independence by hanging up their own coats, putting dishes in the
dishwasher or putting away art materials. Allow the children to
suggest ways to make learning and playing fun and safe. While you
will always closely supervise their activities, you can't be with
all the children every minute. If there are interesting things
for children of different ages to do, you will be able to feed a
baby or prepare lunch knowing that the children are safe, busy
and happy. If you provide structured activities for the older
children, have your center arranged so the younger children can
play quietly without interrupting the sessions, and so you can
monitor their activities.

Your job will be easier if you arrange your center to simplify
everyday routines. Some problems can be prevented by having
selected things where the children can reach them (e.g., toys,
spare clothes and water cups), and others where they can't (e.g.,
house plants, TV, crayons and children's projects). If children
can take care of some of their own needs, it makes them feel
independent and competent and frees you to do other things.
Encourage the older children to help the younger children with
simple tasks such as tying shoes and buttoning or zipping coats;
it reinforces their independence, sharpens their skills and
fosters friendship and learning among peers.

Storage

Adequate storage is especially important for child care providers
with limited space. Well-designed storage  reduces clutter and
increases play space. Boards and cement blocks make sturdy,
inexpensive shelves for preschool and older children. Heavy
cardboard cartons and wooden crates from grocery stores can also
be used to build storage units. Make sure shelves are stable
enough that children won't tip them over when they use the
furniture to pull themselves up to stand or walk.

It is a good idea to rotate toys and materials: put away items
the children are tired of for a few weeks; bring them out later
and the children will enjoy rediscovering them. You may want to
assemble theme boxes containing all the materials you need for a
specific activity.

Every child should have a personal storage area, even if it is
only a shoe box or an ice cream tub. Label it with the child's
name and a special symbol. Each child's special area should be
off limits to the other children. This gives the child a feeling
of belonging and the security of knowing special things can be 
kept safely.

As a businessperson, you will need office space. Efficient
storage of administrative and financial records will save you
time. You may not have the money to purchase a file cabinet or
desk when you open your center. However, you can use drawers and
cabinet space that you usually keep junk in as a file cabinet for
the children's emergency cards, expense receipts and business
papers. Empty shelves can also be used for storing business
records.

It is a good idea to find a secure place to keep your business
records because these records will be used to file your federal
and state taxes at the end of the year. If you misplace any of
your records, filing accurate taxes will be virtually impossible.
_________________________________________________________________

PLANNING THE PROGRAM

Communicating Policies to Parents

Once parents begin to respond to your advertisements, you will
need to make appointments with them to discuss enrolling their
children at the center. At that time, in addition to the
enrollment form, you will need policies that address:

      *     Illness.

      *     Vacation.

      *     Holidays.

      *     Field trips.

      *     The center's hours.

      *     Who is authorized to pick up the child or children.

      *     What extra clothes, if any, will be required.

      *     Activities taking place at the center.

It may be a good idea to develop a child care contract that
explains the policies of your center. If you have a contract,
have parents enrolling their children sign it and provide them
with a copy. That way, if any problems or emergencies arise, the
parents know, up front, what your policies are.

Structuring the Program

How you structure the program for your center is another very
important aspect to consider. Many child care centers, especially
those set up in the home, have no real program -- the children 
just play all day. The same toys are always available but never
presented in any way. Planning is essential to avoid boredom and
to increase learning opportunities.

Your program -- what you and the children do day-by-day -- will 
be the key to your professional success and pleasure. If children
are bored, they not only are missing developmental opportunities,
but also may have more discipline problems and be more difficult 
to get along with. All will be happier if you have interesting
activities that you and they can look forward to daily.

Scheduling

Some providers like to follow a daily schedule, doing the same
activities at approximately the same time every day. Others like
to be more spontaneous, responding to everyone's moods and the
opportunities that come along. If you like tight schedules, you
may need to be more flexible, because young children are
spontaneous; they have their best moments without any warning.

A good provider observes the children for activity ideas.
Sometimes these activities require planning and sometimes they
don't. Put your planning energy into setting up a rich
environment -- set the stage for children to come up with their 
own ideas. Everyday living will provide many of the activities.
Learning to put on a jacket, spreading peanut butter on a
cracker, playing peek-a-boo with a baby -- these are important
activities for young children. Ideally you should have a variety
of activities on hand. Keep a list of possibilities to choose
from when something is needed.

Watch the children's natural tendencies to help you plan an
effective sequence for the day. If they are creative during the
morning, that is a good time for learning (e.g., alphabet,
numbers, art activities). If they tend to get rowdy after a
snack, that is the time to go outside. If they are sleepy and
cuddly after waking from their naps, reading stories might be a
successful activity. If school-age children resist structured
activities when they arrive, they should be allowed free-play
time.

You will need to adjust your routines as new children bring
different needs and personalities to the group. Each group of
children is different. You can plan activities, but make sure you
flow with children's natural tendencies rather than oppose them.
A good policy for planning is to alternate between active and
quiet times, structured and unstructured activities and together
and private times.

Be sure to inform parents what has happened during the day. If
you follow a schedule, post it on the bulletin board or include
it in your parents' handbook. If you don't follow a schedule, you
can list the day's activities. Parents are usually eager to find
out what their children have been doing. Informing them builds
communication and helps parents recognize your efforts and
respect your perceptions.

Activities

Your choice of activities will be influenced by the developmental
levels of the children in your center. The idea behind the
concept that children learn and play in different ways depends on
their experience and interest, ages and special needs. For
example, one two-year-old child might climb better than another
four-year-old child, or a younger child who has played with a
material frequently will use it in more complex ways than an
older child who has not had any experience with that material.

Provide many chances for children to make real choices and
explore ideas or objects on their own. Young children learn by
handling real-life materials. Allow enough time for each
activity, so children don't feel pressured, but have time to see
each activity to completion.

Help children do what they are interested in, and offer materials
and assistance in a way that helps them learn to help themselves,
others and the world, and to feel good about what they can do and
who they are in this world. Curious, confident children will
continue to be eager learners and cooperative children.

Present learning activities and toys in a way that stimulates the
children's interest and play. Children need structured and
unstructured time for learning and experimenting activities. How
you present an activity will vary by the children's development
levels and the mood of the moment. Suppose you want to set up an
art activity with discarded magazines, scissors, paste and paper.
Older children may be able to select the pictures they want to
use, cut them out and paste them on their paper without any help.
You may be needed only to set up the materials. A younger child
may need a lot of help learning how to use scissors and, in fact,
the cutting may turn out to be the whole activity. An example of
both structured and unstructured activities for preschool-age
children developed by the Sha-Za Early Learning Center is shown
in Table 5.

        paper to both groups. Let group A finger paint and 
        group B paint using brushes.

     *  Practice nursery rhymes using hand instruments.
 
     *  Snack.

     *  Introduce the numbers 1-5 and the letters A-C to 
        class. Practice as a group and individually.

     *  Hand coordination and motor skills activity -- Intro-
        duce buttoning, zipping up clothes and typing.

     *  Lunch/free time.

     *  Nap.

     *  Gather for story time.

     *  Snack.

     *  Free time.

      Depending on the ages of the children you may want to
      do an activity all together with a small group or
      individually. Let the children know you value their 
      work. Avoid activities to impress parents; keep your
      program centered on the children at all times. Explain
      to parents why it is important for children to invest
      part of themselves in their work. Watch how proud and
      confident children are when they say I did it myself!

      * Inclusion of the activity developed by the Sha-Za 
        Early Learning Center does not imply SBA's endorse-
        ment of the center's program. It is merely presented
        as a model.

Curriculum

In order to provide quality educational programs for children
from preschool through high school, many states require that
child care providers offer structured educational curriculums to
their children as a condition for certification or registration.
Even if your state does not so stipulate, it is a good idea to
develop an adequate educational program for your center. Parents
will be more likely to view you as a caring professional
dedicated to the total growth and development of their children,
and you will attract more families to your center.

If you do not have the expertise to develop an educational
program for your center, contact an early childhood education
specialist at a local college or university or the National
Association for the Education of Young Children for assistance.
Explain the type of service you are planning to provide and the
age groups you will serve.

There are several concepts you can use to develop a curriculum.
However, many child care professionals recommend that you use the
Developmentally Appropriate Practices or the Montessori Method.
These curriculums are designed to aid a child's intellectual,
social, emotional and physical development. To give you an idea
of what should be included in the curriculum for your center, a
sample is provided in Table 6

Nutrition

Let parents know the times and kinds of meals and snacks you plan
to provide for the children -- for example, by posting weekly or
daily menus -- and inform them of anything special in your
nutrition program, such as the fact that you do not serve sweets.
Most parents will be happy to find a caregiver who is concerned
about children's nutrition. Sometimes parents may request special
nutritional considerations for their children, such as no sugar
or no milk products. If you cannot accommodate the request (for
example, a vegetarian diet), the parents may need to supply
special meals.

If you are licensed or registered, you are eligible for a
substantial reimbursement for your child care food expenses. For
more information on the Child Care Food Program (CCFP), write the
U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250.

Parent Involvement

Children's development depends not only on you as the caregiver,
but also on the parents' involvement. Children feel more secure
and develop into confident, well-rounded individuals when they
know their loved ones support them. Get the parents involved in
the children's educational and recreational activities. For
instance, plan a field trip to a local museum and, if possible,
have some parents accompany you. The children will be pleased
that their parents are going with them. Of course all parents
cannot attend every activity.

Arrange conferences with parents to discuss the skills that you
plan to cover and to give them brief reports of their children's
progress. Parents will be delighted to know you are as concerned
and committed to the total development of their children as they
are.

TRAINING

Providers often begin with no training other than that of being a
parent or a baby-sitter. Since caring for a group of children
often can present more challenges than your experience has
prepared you to meet, you may find that training in early
childhood education and child development is very useful. There
is much to be learned about positive ways to discipline or guide
children and about activities for different developmental levels.

Research has shown that provider training is related to the
quality of child care. Trained providers are more in demand by
parents, who are becoming increasingly sophisticated about
selecting care for their children. Whether or not you have a
college degree or a high school diploma, you are required to have
a minimum of 15 hours of training in early childhood education to
qualify for certification or licensing. For additional
information on these requirements, contact your state or local
child care licensing office.

Training series and individual workshops are offered by resource
and referral agencies, NAEYC affiliate groups, adult education
programs and school districts.

The Child Development Associate Program

The Child Development Associate (CDA) Program is one form of
training available to child care providers. It offers a national
credential based on performance with children and families. By
participating in this program, you can learn more about your work
and be recognized for your skills. The competency standards for
the credential can help you identify your strengths and
weaknesses, even if you do not apply for the program. For more
information about this voluntary program, or a copy of the book
containing all the competencies identified for family child care
providers, call the Council for Early Childhood Professional
Recognition at 202-265-9090 or 800-424-4310.

Other Degree Programs

Many two- and four-year colleges and universities offer degrees
in early childhood education. Although you may not have training
in this field, if you are planning on eventually making this your
lifetime vocation, you may want to consider getting a degree.
There is no doubt that the quality of a child's education depends
not only on the parent's involvement but also on the education of
the teacher and child care provider.

The following degrees are offered in early childhood education:

      1.  Associate of Arts in Child Developmental and Nursery
          School Education -- two-year degree; total hours 
          required for graduation: 72.

      2.  Bachelor of Arts in Early Childhood Education -- four-  
          year degree; total hours required for graduation: 125.
 
      3.  Master of Arts in Early Childhood Education -- graduate
          degree; total hours required for graduation depends on
          degree requirements.
 
      4.  PhD in Early Childhood Education -- total hours
          required for graduation depends on degree requirements.

Remember, the criteria for graduation depend on the requirements
set by individual institutions. For information specific to the
degree program you are interested in, contact the admissions
office of the college or university nearest you.

The income projection (profit and loss) statement is valuable as
both a planning tool and a key management tool to help control
business operations. It enables the owner-manager to develop a
preview of the amount of income generated each month and for the
business year, based on reasonable predictions of monthly levels of
sales, costs and expenses.

As monthly projects are developed and entered into the income
projection statement, they can serve as definite goals for
controlling the business operation. As actual operating results
become known each month, they should be recorded for comparison
with the monthly projections. A completed income statement allows
the owner-manager to compare actual figures with monthly
projections and to take steps to correct any problems.

Industry Percentage

In the industry percentage column, enter the percentages of total
sales (revenues) that are standard for your industry which are
derived by dividing

          cost/expense items by total net sales x 100%

These percentages can be obtained from various sources, such as
trade associations, accountants or banks. The reference librarian
in your nearest public library can refer you to documents that
contain the percentage figures, for example, Robert Morris
Associates' Annual Statement Studies (1 Liberty Place, Philadelphia
PA  19103)

Industry figures serve as a useful benchmark against which to
compare cost and expense estimates that you develop for your firm.
Compare the figures in the industry column to those in the annual
percentage column

Total Net Sales (Revenues)

Determine the total number of units or products or services you
realistically expect to sell each month in each department at the
prices you expect to get. Use this step to create the projection to
review your pricing practices.

     *     What returns, allowances and markdowns can be 
           expected?

     *     Exclude any revenue that is not strictly related to 
           the business.

Cost of Sales

The key to calculating your cost of sales is that you do not
overlook any costs that you have incurred. Calculate cost of sales
for all products and services used to determine total net sales.
Where inventory is involved, do not overlook transportation costs.
Also include any direct labor.

Gross Profit

Subtract the total cost of sales from the total net sales to obtain
gross profit.

Gross Profit Margin.

The gross profit margin is expressed as a percentage of total sales
(revenues) it is calculated by dividing

                       gross profits by total net sales

Controllable Expenses

     *     Salary expenses -- Base pay plus overtime.

     *     Payroll expenses -- Include paid vacations, sick 
           leave, health insurance unemployment insurance and
           social security taxes.

     *     Outside services -- Include costs of subcontracts,
           overflow work and special or one-time services.

     *     Supplies -- Services and items purchase for use in the
           business.

     *     Repairs and maintenance -- Regular maintenance and
           repair, including periodic large expenditures such as
           painting.

     *     Advertising -- Include desired sales volume and
           classified directory advertising expenses.

     *     Car, delivery and travel -- Include charges if 
           personal car is used in business, including parking,
           tolls, buying trips, etc.

     *     Accounting and legal -- Outside professional services.

Fixed Expenses

     *     Rent -- List only real estate used in the business

     *     Depreciation -- Amortization of capital assets.

     *     Utilities -- Water, heat, light, etc.

     *     Insurance -- Fire or liability on property or 
           products. Include workers' compensation.

     *     Loan repayments -- Interest on outstanding loans.

     *     Miscellaneous -- Unspecified; small expenditures 
           without separate accounts.

Net Profit (loss)        *     Subtract total expenses from 
(before taxes)                 gross profit

Taxes                    *     Include inventory and sales taxes, 
                               excise tax, real estate tax, etc.

Net Profit (loss)        *     Subtract taxes from net profit 
(after taxes)                  (before taxes)

Annual Total             *     For each of the sales and expense
                               items in your income projection
                               statement, add all the monthly
                               figures across the table and put
                               the results in the annual total
                               column.

Annual Percentage        *     Calculate the percentage by 
                               dividing annual total by total net
                               sales x 100%

                         *     Compare this figure to the
                               industry percentage in the first
                               column
