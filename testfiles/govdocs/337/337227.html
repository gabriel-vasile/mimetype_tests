<hr /><pre>
Usage: 3dDWItoDT [options] gradient-file dataset
Computes 6 principle direction tensors from multiple gradient vectors
 and corresponding DTI image volumes.
 The program takes two parameters as input :  
    a 1D file of the gradient vectors with lines of ASCII floats Gxi,Gyi,Gzi
.    a 3D bucket dataset with Np+1 sub-briks where the first sub-brik is the volume
    acquired with no diffusion weighting.
 Options:
   -automask =  so that the correlation is only computed between
   high-intensity (presumably brain) voxels.  The
   intensity level is determined the same way that
   3dClipLevel works.
 The output is a 6 sub-brick bucket dataset containing Dxx,Dxy,Dxz,Dyy,Dyz,Dzz.
 These results are appropriate as the input to the 3dDTeig program.


INPUT DATASET NAMES
-------------------
This program accepts datasets that are modified on input according to the
following schemes:
  'r1+orig[3..5]'                                    {sub-brick selector}
  'r1+orig<100.200>'                                 {sub-range selector}
  'r1+orig[3..5]<100..200>'                          {both selectors}
  '3dcalc( -a r1+orig -b r2+orig -expr 0.5*(a+b) )'  {calculation}
For the gruesome details, see the output of 'afni -help'.
