October 1990

16th Oct.       : TCM 1 radial part completed nominally.  Spin rate 5.015 rpm.

17th Oct.       : UMCS System back-up and maintenance.

18th Oct.       : TCM 1 axial part.  First part of manoeuvre terminated 
                  on-board because Solar Aspect Angle deadbands exceeded.  
                  Manoeuvre restarted with a different AOCS configuration.  
                  TCM 1 completed nominally.

19th Oct.       : Covers released (except LAN).
                  KEP switched on.
                  GLG 2W heater not switched on - not required.
                  BAM-I aperture set to maximum. 
                  KEP platform calibration 1 time-tag commands prepared and
                  transmitted.

20th Oct.       : GRU switch-on delayed 1 week because of high sensor temp.
                  GLG switched on for thermal monitoring.  GLG switched off.
                  KEP platform calibration 2 time-tagged commands prepared and
                  transmitted.

21st Oct.       : Weekend monitoring. 
22nd Oct.       : Weekend monitoring. 

23rd Oct.       : KEP platform calibration 2 monitored. 
                  SIM switched on.  Initial tests performed.  KET HVs switched
                  on.  HET calibration performed.

                  X-band calibration manoeuvre performed.
                  SIM AT and LET calibration time-tagged commands prepared and
                  transmitted. 

24th Oct.       : SIM checkout and calibrations performed.
                  KEP -HV test, scan 64, 8*8 time-tag commands prepared and 
                  transmitted.

25th Oct.       : HED FGM &amp; VHM switch-on successful.
                  KEP -HV test, scan 64, 8*8.  -HV switch-on successful. 
                  KEP +HV test, scan 64, 8*8 time-tag commands prepared and 
                  transmitted.

26th Oct.       : HED checkout.  Analogue despun channels not processed properly
                  onboard.  Processing of digital data on ground must be 
                  performed and distributed to scientific community instead.
                  No scientific data lost.
                  KEP LiF evaporation, -HV test, scan 80, 10*8 time-tagged
                  commands prepared and transmitted.

27th Oct.       : KEP LiF evaporation completed. Scan started.
                  GRU switch-on successful.  Channeltron not switched on.

28th Oct.       : Weekend monitoring. 
29th Oct.       : Weekend monitoring. 

30th Oct.       : GRU checkout continued.

31st Oct.       : GRU, HED, KEP &amp; SIM monitored and controlled.
