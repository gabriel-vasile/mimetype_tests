<pre>Plans for Today: 
1. Find out why we got kicked out of integration last night 
2. Analyze data from last night 
     a. use Petar's dump program 
     b. SVXMon 
     c. Matt's ntuple 
3. Get SVXMon running properly online again 
4. make access list 
5. did calibration consumer finally succeed 
6, Steve wants to switch some VRBs</pre>

<pre>Last Night they had trouble initializing FIB crates. 
This morning running standalone I find that all Fibs fail  
on the first (and perhaps only) byte read back.  Making 
the Fib Fanouts use their own clock instead of the one 
provided via the Src from the real Clock results in 
sucessful initialization.  I subsequently discovered that 
the Clock Fanout to the SRC is not receiving ANY Beam Structure 
signals - presumably this happened when they changed the 
clock to a 1x8 structure.  The Clock Fanout Transmitter 
in Slot 17 of the Clock Crate (2RR21I-B) seems to not 
be sending out its signals (Green LED under "out" label is 
not lit).  Steve Chappa has been called. </pre>

Steve Chappa is sick but can be called at home... Steve, please
check with me for the number.

Silicon cooling system and power going down for some work on interlocks by Steve Blusk. 
Should be back up in a couple of hours.

<pre>Run 100888 was taken in non-Myron mode, integrated with CDF. 
Biases on, same mode as this morning (neighbor, dps on, 
threshold 5), WITH the CLC supposedly in time and min-bias 
triggers only.</pre>
<!-- Author: Alan Sill -->
<!-- Comment: Mon Oct  9 15;44;07 comment by...AFS -->
Run 100892 is currently in progress, same conditions but with L1 early Myron mode.
Both of these are with the 1x8 clock (now fixed to work with the silicon)
as opposed to the 36x36 stuff that was taken this morning.

They were neighbour mode. DPS on.  
Now they are read all. DPS off.

DPS off. Read all. Myron mode. SVX396.  
Calib Continous. Bias on. No beam. No magnet.  
 
After taking a few 1000 events, we overload the computer.  
DO NOT run SVXMON and display on the same time, on the  
same machine, which the run control is running!</pre>

We got an error message window said that

We putted the HRR button on. No effect. 
 
We halted. 
We are going to close all the window

Why did you click "ignore BC?

<pre>Run 100930 (0x18a42)  
Failed to run-- trying calibration run after restart exactly 
as in web page (same as before but no "IgnoreBC"), still no  
luck.  Timeout in getting crate acknowledgment after starting 
run.  Window listing crates showed all green at start, after 
starting and subsequent timeout, all svx crates and also  
b0tsi00 are yellow...(?)
