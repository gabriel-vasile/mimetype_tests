<h2>Editing an annotation </h2>

<h3>Why edit?</h3>

<p class="main">Editing reverses the writing process: the writer goes from
the book to the annotation; the editor goes from the annotation
to the book. The editor can look at the announcement
as the reader would-without necessarily any prior knowledge
of the book-and consider what it tells. Editors are
looking for exactly the same things writers should have
been concerned with; they simply start in a different place.
Editing does not automatically mean making changes; the
review may show that the copy can stand as written. Or it
may show quite the opposite: that a complete rewrite is
needed. Most annotations will fall somewhere in between,
with some changes needed. From an editing point of view,
annotations come in four categories:</p>

<ul>
	 <li>no editing or minimal changes needed</li>
	 <li>some editing needed to correct grammar or construction</li>
	 <li>multiple errors that require revision</li>
	 <li>serious content problems that may require rethinking and rewriting</li>
</ul>

<p class="main">Editors should have available the source material, and
sometimes the book itself, so that content can be verified.</p>

<p class="main">Put down the pencil! Like writers, editors have to take
time to think. All editing begins with questioning: Are
these the right words for the purpose? Read the announcement
as a whole: bibliographic information, description,
and additional information. Then consider the following
questions about the annotation:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Is it stylistically correct?</li>
	<li>Is it grammatical?</li>
	<li>Is it interesting?</li>
	<li>Is it judgmental?</li>
	<li>Does it describe the book?</li>
	<li>Are the facts accurate?</li>
</ul>

<p class="main">These questions are arranged, not in order of importance,
but according to usual editorial procedure. Errors in style
and grammar hit the eye first; determining accuracy of
content requires research. A simple language change can
disclose other problems. All questions must be handled, but
they cannot always be dealt with in the order given.</p>

<h3>Is the annotation stylistically correct?</h3>

<p class="main">The most common mistakes will be corrected easily and,
since they are common, almost automatically by the editor.
For less frequent and more complicated situations, the editor
should have two references readily available, The
Chicago Manual of Style and Merriam-Webster's Collegiate
Dictionary, Tenth Edition. If a more complete dictionary is
needed to locate a word, that word is probably too obscure
to present to readers, who should not have to interrupt their
selection process to consult a dictionary.</p>

<p class="main">Most groups will develop their own style lists and practices.
Those for NLS consist largely of frequently used but
scattered sections of the basic style manual, plus some
deviations from that style, and a few situations not covered.
(See Part Two: Style and Presentation, p. 131.)</p>

<h3>Is the annotation grammatical?</h3>

<h4>Subject and verb agreement</h4>

<p class="main">Grammatical mistakes may be simple to correct: locate
the subject and the verb and bring them into agreement.
Sentences may require some rearranging or rewriting if
the subject and verb are too far apart and difficult to locate,
even if they do agree.</p>

<div class="group">
<p class="mainindent"><em>Sentence:</em> Auntie Tiger Lil, followed by her niece
Lily in a large cylindrical costume, hotly pursue the
thief.</p>

<p class="mainindent"><em>Problem:</em> Although two people are in this chase,
the subject of the sentence, Auntie Tiger Lil, is singular;
information about the niece is parenthetical. The
verb should be pursues.</p>
</div>

<div class="group">
  <p class="mainindent">Sentence: Lonsdale College of Oxford will soon
    be seeking a new master, and there appears to be
  only two main contenders-Storrs and Cornford.</p>
  <p class="mainindent"><em>Problem:</em> In this case, the subject is not there but
    the people listed after the verb, and there are two of
  them. The verb should be appear.</p>
</div>

<div class="group">
  <p class="mainindent"><em>Sentence:</em> Lively stories of the names of some of
    the most familiar stars, planets, and constellations
    include what ancient people believed about them
  and what scientists know today.</p>
  <p class="mainindent"><em>Problem:</em> All those words between the subject and
    the verb (which do agree), including three of phrases.
    Procedure: Divide into two sentences, give the
    first its own verb, and delete the wordiness. Also
  delete the judgmental adjective lively.</p>
  <p class="mainindent"><em>Edited:</em> Stories explain the names of familiar stars,
  planets, and constellations. Covers...</p>
</div>
<h4>Misplaced modifiers</h4>

<p class="main">Misplaced modifiers are so far from the words they describe
that readers cannot be sure which words are meant. The
meaning must be clarified. These phrases usually have
to be moved to their correct location and the sentence
repunctuated, rewritten, or divided.</p>

<div class="group">
  <p class="mainindent"><em>Sentence:</em> Like the saint, Margarita becomes a
  familiar figure in the Bay area serving the outcasts.</p>
  <p class="mainindent"><em>Problem:</em> Serving the outcasts should modify figure.
    Note that it could also modify area, but that
    would give a different, and unintended, meaning to
  the sentence.</p>
  <p class="mainindent"><em>Procedure:</em> Move the phrase to follow figure.</p>
</div>
<h4>Dangling participles</h4>

<p class="main">Dangling participles are often coupled with other language
or content problems. They always require rewriting to
clarify.</p>

<div class="group">
  <p class="mainindent"><em>Example:</em> Meeting in 1946 (1) when Ivinskaya was
  a beautiful young editor (2), this is an account of
  (3) their love for each other. (The unidentified half
  of their is Russian author Boris Pasternak.)
  Problems: (1) The phrase is dangling rather than
  misplaced because it doesn't modify any of the subsequent
  words. It also doesn't indicate the duration
  of their relationship, which has a bearing on her credentials
  for writing this book. (2) This description
  can cover a twenty-year span. She was in her midthirties
  -hardly elderly, but the meaning of beautiful,
  young would surely be different for a gothic novel.
  (3) Wordy within the annotation as well as at the
  beginning.</p>
  <p class="mainindent"><em>Procedure:</em> Could be made grammatical by replacing
  meeting with Ivinskaya and Pasternak met and
  dividing into two sentences. That correction would
  not solve the content problems. Needs research and
  rewriting.</p>
  <p class="mainindent"><em>Rewritten:</em> This love story covers the last fourteen
  years of Pasternak's life, which Ivinskaya shared,
  and ...</p>
</div>

<h4>Ambiguous pronouns</h4>

<p class="main">Correcting other grammatical mistakes may also take
research. Ambiguous pronouns require discovering which
person is meant. Reviews or the book jacket may clarify
the reference; some reading may be necessary.</p>

<div class="group">
  <p class="mainindent"><em>Example:</em> Traces the lives of frontiersman
  Matthew Howard, a follower of Jefferson and his
  aristocratic wife.</p>
  <p class="mainindent"><em>Problem:</em> Grammatically, the wife referred to must
  be Jefferson's, because his name is the nearest reference
  to the pronoun. But lives is plural and must refer
  to Howard and his wife, as there is no other person
  indicated.</p>
  <p class="mainindent"><em>Procedure:</em> An easy one. Insert a comma after
  Jefferson to make the phrase parenthetical; Mrs.
  Howard is the wife being discussed. Or rearrange,
  if the relationships still seem obscure.</p>
</div>

<h4>Parallel structure</h4>

<p class="main">Lack of parallel structure can also obscure meaning, especially
if one section contains a vague phrase. Finding more
precise language may require more knowledge of the book.</p>

<div class="group">
  <p class="mainindent"><em>Example:</em> Relates the story of Sir John
  Ollenshaw's crippled son, Philip, who grew up in
  hatred and neglect, left England for America, and
  what he accomplished there.</p>
  <p class="mainindent"><em>Problems:</em> The final phrase needs a verb form parallel
  with grew up and left. What did he accomplish?
  Also, some wordiness could be eliminated and the
  tense made more immediate.</p>
  <p class="mainindent">Procedure: Check the sources for a specific
  accomplishment.</p>
  <p class="mainindent"><em>Rewritten:</em> Sir John Ollenshaw's crippled son,
  Philip, grows up in hatred and neglect, leaves
  England for America, and learns to survive in the
  wilderness.</p>
</div>

<div class="mainindent">
  <p class="title">No Time to Say Goodbye:
  Surviving the Suicide of a Loved One</p>
  <p class="by">by Carla Fine</p>
  <p class="main"><em>Annotation:</em> Seven years before writing this book,
    the author learned that her forty-four-year-old husband
    had killed himself. <strong>She writes of her experiences
    in dealing with this, and discusses the stories
    of the people she met in survivor groups and
    the comments of experts.</strong> Included are lists of related
    organizations, resources, and support groups.
  Some violence. 1997.</p>
  <div class="group">
    <p class="main"><em>Problems:</em> The major problem in the middle sentence
    is lack of parallel structure; there are three elements
    (<em>experiences</em>, <em>stories</em>, and <em>comments</em>) but only
    two verbs (<em>writes of</em> and <em>discusses</em>), with the second
    verb trying to cover two of the three. In addition,
    there is some weak writing: the repetition of <em>write</em>  from the first sentence, a vague <em>this</em> referring back to
    the entire first sentence, and unnecessary use of the
    definite article <em>the</em>. Also the next sentence is written
    in the passive voice.</p>
    <p class="main"><em>Edited:</em> She <em>relates</em> her experiences in dealing with
    her <em>anguish</em>, <em>discusses</em> stories of people she met in
    survivor groups, and <em>provides</em> comments of experts.
    <em>Includes</em>...</p>
  </div>
</div>
<h3>Is the annotation interesting?</h3>

<p class="main">A good annotation won't get people to select books on subjects
they don't care about, but a dull or vague annotation
might cause them to ignore books they would enjoy or find
useful. Editors need to consider:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Does the annotation contain information that achieves the purpose?</li>
	<li>Does it leave something to the reader by not giving away too much of the plot?</li>
	<li>Is it concise and easy to follow?</li>
	<li>Does it use clear and descriptive language?</li>
</ul>

<p class="main">If the answer to any of these questions is no, the editor will
have to study the annotation to isolate its problems. Editors
must consider the facts chosen for inclusion, the structure
and balance of their presentation, and the language used to
express them. Editors may have to separate these interwoven
factors. They may have to rearrange language, add or
substitute more precise and descriptive words, and eliminate
wordiness. They may also have to add some facts for
balance and delete some for conciseness.</p>

<h4>Are appropriate facts chosen?</h4>

<p class="main">The annotation should cover the basic content of the book
and the direction the author is taking. Focusing too much
on how things begin, for either fiction or nonfiction,
detracts from what is covered or where the theme is leading.</p>

<div class="mainindent">
  <p class="title">Marina and Lee</p>
  <p class="by">by Priscilla Johnson McMillan</p>
  <p class="main"><em>Annotation:</em> (1) A former member of Sen. John F.
  Kennedy's staff, later a Moscow-based reporter who
  interviewed Lee Harvey Oswald, (2) tells the intimate
  details of his marriage to a Russian and his personal
  life. (3) A sympathetic portrait (4) of this
  unlikely couple's life together in Russia and America
  and (5) a discussion of Oswald's motive for assassinating
  Kennedy. 1977.</p></div>
  
  <div class="group">
  <p class="mainindent"><em>Problems:</em> (1) The book-jacket information about
  the author and several reviews of the book confirm
  her connections to Kennedy and Oswald; they probably
  explain the author's interest in the subject. The
  reader would probably conclude that the material
  came from these sources. Actually, most of it came
  from research and from Mrs. Oswald, who is not
  mentioned as a source. Also, the background of the
  author has a more prominent position in the annotation
  than the subject of the book. (2) Wrong order;
  his personal life should come first and then his marriage,
  which was eventually a part of it. (3) This
  statement should come first to introduce what the
  book is about. <em>Sympathetic</em> is an acceptable modifier
  in this context; it goes to the attitude of the author.
  (4) <em>Unlikely</em> is a judgmental word without some
  defining content. (5) This statement could be more
  precise and intriguing; does the author have an opinion
  to offer?</p>
  <p class="mainindent"><em>Rewritten:</em> Sympathetic portrait of Lee Harvey
  Oswald's personal life and intimate details of his
  marriage. Written with his Russian-born widow's
  cooperation, this study depicts the couple's life
  together in Russia and America and theorizes that
  Oswald's motives for assassinating Kennedy were
  both political and personal.</p>
</div>

<h4>Does the annotation leave something for the reader?</h4>

<p>Telling too much of the plot can destroy interest. Seeming to
give away the whole story is as deadly as actually doing it.</p>

<div class="box">Watch out for too much information</div>

<div class="mainindent">
  <p class="title">All the Rivers Run</p>
  <p class="by">by Nancy Cato</p>
  <p class="main"><em>Annotation:</em> Orphaned in a shipwreck and cut off
  from her native England, twelve-year-old Delie
  begins a new life in the gold-mining town of Kiandra
  in Australia. Raised by relatives in the outback country,
  she becomes a lovely young woman, leaves home
  to study art, and marries a riverboat captain.</p>
</div>

<div class="group">
  <p class="mainindent"><em>Comment:</em> 
  The first sentence sets the scene well,
  except for excess prepositions at the end. The second
  sentence gives a rather flat outline of the plot, with
  the implication that the heroine married and they
  lived happily ever after. There is little to entice the
  reader's imagination. Actually, much of the action
  takes place after the marriage; there was no proverbial
  happy ending at that point. Some small editorial
  changes could remove the wrong impression and
  throw the focus more on the setting, where it belongs
  for this novel. Discovering what happens in the heroine's
  life would depend on reading the book-the
  reader's choice.</p>
  <p class="mainindent"><em>Rewritten:</em> Orphaned in a shipwreck and shut off
  from her native England, twelve-year-old Delie
  begins a new life in Kiandra, an Australian goldmining
  town. The saga of her life is set in the outback
  country where she is raised, in the cities where
  she studies art, and on the riverboat where she raises
  her own family.</p>
</div>

<h4>Is it concise and easy to follow?</h4>

<p class="main">Facts selected need to move the reader easily from the
opening premise or situation through to an ending that
supports the premise or leads onward into the plot. When
the sentences are overstuffed or meander through a variety
of unconnected facts, the reader is put to too much work
sorting things out and can easily lose interest.</p>

<div class="group">
  <p class="mainindent"><em>Example:</em> With the mistakenly convicted young
  murderer of his wife Nina about to be executed,
  Steve's asthmatic six-year-old son who witnessed his
  mother's murder is kidnapped-possibly by the real
  murderer.</p>
  <p class="mainindent"><em>Comment:</em> Some commas would help. The sentence
  ends well, but there is too much information
  preceding the final phrase. The wife's name adds
  little, and too many facts about the son are stuffed
  in. If the person was convicted erroneously, he's not
  a murderer; all those words include one that's wrong.
  Such mistakes are easier to make when too much
  information is being handled as a unit.</p>
  <p class="mainindent"><em>Edited:</em> As the young man mistakenly convicted of
  murdering Steve's wife is about to be executed,
  Steve's asthmatic six-year-old son is kidnapped-
  possibly by the real murderer.</p>
</div>

<h4>Is the language clear and descriptive?</h4>

<p class="main">Many problems are caused by choice of words: misused
words, unnecessary words, too few words, words that could
be better selected, words that would be better placed, words
that should never be used.</p>
<h5>Misused words</h5>

<div class="group">
  <p class="mainindent"><em>Sentence:</em> Account of the author's <strong>bout</strong> with
  rheumatoid arthritis from the age of twenty-five, and
  her determination not to be thought of, and treated as,
  a cripple.</p>
  <p class="mainindent"><em>Comment:</em> Bout is generally used for a short-term,
  one-time conflict. It's inappropriate for the description
  of a lifelong struggle. Note that using cripple is
  appropriate here; the negative connotation is what
  she was trying to avoid.</p>
</div>
<div class="group">
  <p class="mainindent"><em>Sentence:</em> <strong>Personalized</strong> 
  overview of Tito's swiftly changing land by a former Yugoslav....</p>
  <p class="mainindent"><em>Comment:</em> Personalized means made for someone,
  such as stationery or T-shirts. The point of view was
  taken by someone and was from a <em>personal</em> perspective.</p>
</div>

<div class="group">
  <p class="mainindent"><em>Sentence:</em> Born <strong>illegitimately</strong>, 
  Brown was adopted by relatives and raised in the south.</p>
  <p class="mainindent"><em>Comment:</em> Illegitimacy is not something active that
  can be encompassed in an adverb; it is a legal or societal
  concept described by an adjective. Use <em>Born
  illegitimate</em>, or rewrite.</p>
  <p class="mainindent"><em>Rewritten:</em> Describes her illegitimate birth, adoption
  by relatives, and southern childhood.</p>
</div>

<div class="group">
  <p class="mainindent"><em>Sentence:</em> Although the Aborigine is <em>suppose</em> to
  complete his walkabout alone...</p>
  <p class="mainindent"><em>Comment:</em> To <em>suppose</em> is to speculate or assume.
  The word for being required to is <em>supposed</em>.</p>
</div>

<div class="group">
  <p class="mainindent"><em>Sentence:</em> A <strong>most unique</strong> presentation...</p>
  <p class="mainindent"><em>Comment:</em> <em>Unique</em> means singular, without equal.
  A one-of-a-kind thing cannot be more or less so.
  Unique cannot be compared; delete <em>most</em>.</p>
</div>

<div class="group">
  <p class="mainindent"><em>Annotation:</em> The <strong>mythology</strong> 
  of cleanliness moving
  up next to godliness is the prime <strong>tenet</strong> <em>of [the
  author's]</em> thesis, and he <strong>debunks</strong> it well.</p>
  <p class="mainindent"><em>Comment:</em> <em>Thesis</em> is an 
  argument presented and a
  <em>tenet</em> can be part of that; but <em>debunks</em> means to
  expose sham pretensions. The words are contradictory
  and at least one is misused. The editor has to
  determine whether <strong>cleanliness</strong> is a tenet or a target.
  The presence of <em>mythology</em>, even though incorrectly
  used, suggests that the intent is to explode the myth.
  Note that the last clause passes judgment on the
  author's success with handling the subject.</p>
  <p class="mainindent"><em>Procedure:</em> Definitely rewrite.</p>
</div>

<h5>Unnecessary words</h5>

<p class="main">The annotation should be kept tight,
for both space considerations and ease of reading. Often
wordiness creeps in when the writer has difficulty getting
to the point-or perhaps getting the point.</p>

<div class="group">
  <p class="mainindent"><em>Example:</em> There is a final 
  section that also discusses his conclusions.</p>
  <p class="mainindent"><em>Procedure:</em> Edit to &quot;The final section discusses his
  conclusions.&quot; Eliminate the statement entirely if
  there is already enough information. Better still, substitute
  a sentence summarizing the conclusions. To
  identify the conclusions is much more meaningful
  than to tell where they are placed in the book.</p> 
</div>

<div class="group">
  <p class="mainindent"><em>Examples:</em></p>
  <ul> 
	 <li>The adventures of...who ...</li>
	  <li>A collection of...that ...</li>
</ul>  
  <p class="mainindent"><em>Procedure:</em> Such phrases should be eliminated and
  the subject approached directly. The information
  needed is the content indicated by the ellipses.</p>
</div>

<h5>Too few words</h5>

<p class="main">Often an annotation that is seemingly
correct is also bland and fails to indicate the approach
of the writer or the tone of the book. A few well-chosen
descriptive words or phrases can make a big difference.</p>

<div class="mainindent">
  <p class="title">How to Travel with a Salmon and Other Essays</p>
  <p class="by">by Umberto Eco</p>
  <p class="main">Annotation: In this collection (1) of forty-one

  Stripes&quot; is a science fiction tale (3) of intergalactic
  sex and espionage. Some violence and some descriptions
  of sex.</p>
  <p class="main"><em>Comment:</em> (1) Readers know from the bibliographic
  statements that this book is a collection of essays by
  Mr. Eco; the only new information in the first part of
  the sentence is the number of entries. (2) <em>Reflects</em>
  how? We need an adjective to indicate the approach.
  (3) In spite of the book's title, a science fiction tale
  is not an essay.</p>
  <p class="main"><em>Edited:</em> Forty-one pieces give the Italian author's
  curmudgeonly reflections on the follies of modern

  cellular phones, private and public libraries, and
  sequels. One lengthy parody entitled &quot;Stars and
  Stripes&quot; is a science fiction tale of intergalactic sex
  and espionage. Some violence and some descriptions of sex.</p> </div>

<h5>Words that could be better selected</h5>

<p class="main">Many aspects of
language could be considered under this heading. In general,
the editor should see if the wording can be tightened,
if synonyms are needed to avoid repetition, if additions
would add definition or interest, or if substitutions are
needed.</p>

<div class="group">
  <p class="mainindent"><em>Tightening:</em> shows how false the common view is</p>
  <p class="mainindent"><em>Edited:</em> shows common misconceptions</p>

  <p class="mainindent"><em>Edited:</em> sending towns backward into prehistoric settlements 
  and forward into futuristic cities</p>

<div class="group">
  <p class="mainindent"><em>Adding interest:</em> In London William Helder meets
  the beautiful Hazel Paget</p>
  <p class="mainindent"><em>Edited:</em> A rich London bachelor meets an attractive
  Cambridgeshire secretary (descriptions indicate more about the plot than names)</p>

<div class="group">

<p class="mainindent"><em>Substituting to expand information:</em></p>

which looks to <strong>original meaning</strong> for adapting
the document in modern circumstances. Examines
specific issues, such as federalism.
</p>
<p class="main"><em>Comment:</em> Using some form of the title three more
times in the annotation does not enlarge on the concept,
and it kills interest. Some explanatory phrases
need to be substituted and more information incorporated.</p>
<p class="main"><em>Edited:</em> Explores the ideological and political
assumptions that underlie the original meanings
of the Constitution and the resulting ambiguities.
Critiques the method that looks solely to the

</div>

<h5>Words that could be better placed</h5>

<p class="main">Positioning makes a difference in readability and often in thrust.</p>

<div class="mainindent">
  <p class="title">The Book of Sand</p>
  <p class="by">by Jorge Luis Borges</p>
  <p class="main"><em>Annotation:</em> An assortment of thirteen short stories
  from the distinguished blind Argentinean poet <strong>that
  contains fable, philosophy, and autobiography.</strong></p>
  <p class="main"><em>Comment:</em> The poet doesn't contain these things;
  the clause really modifies <em>assortment</em>, which is two
  prepositional phrases back in the sentence. Even
  without the grammatical problem, starting with these
  content words provides more interest.</p>
  <p class="main"><em>Edited:</em> Fable, philosophy, and autobiography in
  thirteen short stories from the distinguished blind
  Argentinean poet.</p>
</div>

<h5>Words that should not be used</h5>

<p class="main">Inappropriate words
include those that violate sensitivities and those that appear
to judge the author. Many others are hard to classify but,
like a Supreme Court justice's comment on pornography,
you know it when you see it. Editors need to be alert.</p>

<div class="group">
  <p class="mainindent"><em>Example:</em> Tells of the hopes and understanding
  needed for dealing with a <strong>hopelessly</strong> retarded child.</p>
  <p class="mainindent"><em>Comment:</em> The book explains that the parents
  haven't given up hope. Putting <em>hopes</em> and <em>hopelessly</em>
  in the same sentence needlessly emphasizes the difficulty.
  In addition, <em>hopelessly</em> is judgmental about the
  condition.</p>
  <p class="mainindent"><em>Edited:</em> ...severely retarded child (or, a child with

<div class="group">
  <p class="mainindent"><em>Example:</em> The <strong>narrator</strong>, a ten-year-old child,
  discloses...</p>
  <p class="mainindent"><em>Comment:</em> <em>Narrator</em> is frequently used to identify
  the point of view of a novel written in the first person.
  However, the word has a specific meaning for
  NLS patrons: the person who is reading the book for
  the recorded version, who is also called a reader. To
  avoid confusion, the word should not be used in its
  usual sense. In this case, the annotation can simply
  begin with <em>A ten-year-old child</em>.</p>
</div>

<div class="box">Sexual innuendo: What did that say?</div>

<h5>Freudian traps</h5>

<p class="main">Also look at whether the annotation has
any hidden Freudian traps-situations where the writer
intended one reading and the reader may find quite another.
Grammatical errors can often lead to amusing interpretations,
but none get quite as much reaction as those with
sexual connotations, even mild ones. The annotation should
not become, unintentionally, too interesting. These statements
often provoke the proverbial double-take: <em>What did
that say?</em></p>

<div class="mainindent">
  <p class="title">Every Other Man</p>
  <p class="by">by Mary Ann Bartusis</p>
  <p class="main"><em>Consider:</em> Explores some of the deep-seated emotional
  conditions that cause men to be unfaithful and
  gives specific details on handling many aspects of
  extramarital affairs.</p>
  <p class="main"><em>Reconsider:</em> Is the book a how-to manual for philandering
  husbands? The statement should be directed
  to its proper audience.</p>
  <p class="main"><em>Edited:</em> ...and gives women techniques for coping
  with many aspects of their husbands' extramarital
  affairs.</p>

<div class="mainindent">
  <p class="title">All Things Wise and Wonderful</p>
  <p class="by">by James Herriot</p>
  <p class="main"><em>Consider:</em> Yorkshire veterinarian recalls his stint in
  the RAF during World War II and expresses his feelings
  about his new family and friends, including his
  first child whom his wife delivered....</p>
  <p class="main"><em>Reconsider:</em> Veterinarian or not, it's unlikely that
  he had the child and she did the delivery. The writer
  was thinking about his not being there when the
  baby was born, but the sentence doesn't read that
  way.</p>
  <p class="main"><em>Procedure:</em> The easiest solution is to delete everything
  after child. Alternatively, the editor could insert
  the birth of before his first child. Either way, the
  phrase about the delivery should go, and family and
  friends should be reversed.</p>
</div>

  <p class="main"><em>Consider:</em> Fictionalized account of the Dutch
  painter follows his tortured life of unsuccessful love

  and accomplishment. Some explicit descriptions of
  sex.</p>
  <p class="main"><em>Reconsider:</em> The writer had in mind artistic technique
  and accomplishment, which is only one part of
  the book. The title and the placement of the phrase
  might easily indicate that the subject is still sex,
  especially when followed by the tagline about explicit
  descriptions.</p>
  <p class="main"><em>Procedure:</em> Divide into two sentences and make
  sure that his love life and his artistic endeavors are
  clearly delineated.</p>
</div>

<h3>Is the annotation judgmental?</h3>

<p class="main">Most judgments occur in adjectives describing the book:
<em>exciting</em>, <em>poignant</em>, <em>easily read</em> and <em>interesting</em>. 
Some judgments are even more overt: <em>a joyful collection</em>, <em>a useful
and entertaining work</em>, <em>a highly readable book</em>, <em>an essay of
wide-ranging importance</em>. Editors must eliminate words
and phrases that tell readers what they will think about a
book. These judgments almost leap to the eye, and editors
will eliminate them easily.</p>

<div class="box">The Library of Congress has no opinion</div>

<p class="main">Other judgments are more subtle and require consideration
of the impact of words that judge the action described
rather than the approach of the book.</p>

<div class="group">
  <p class="mainindent"><em>Example:</em> At fifty-one, the author <strong>finally</strong> comes to
  terms with his homosexuality.</p>
  <p class="mainindent"><em>Comment:</em> That <em>finally</em> implies that he should have
  done it sooner. Unless a long struggle is identified
  earlier in the annotation, the word is judgmental and
  should be eliminated. The age listed conveys duration,
  and the more succinct sentence has more
  impact.</p>
</div>

<h4>Endorsement of books or authors</h4>

<p class="main">More serious are characterizations of authors or style of
writing that state directly or imply that the Library of
Congress endorses some books or authors.</p>

<div class="mainindent">
  <p class="title">A Fine and Pleasant Misery</p>
  <p class="by">by Patrick F. McManus</p>
  <p class="main">Annotation: Twenty-seven (1) mirth-provoking,
  (2) cautionary camping reminiscences that originally
  appeared in <cite>Field and Stream</cite>. Considered by critics
  as (3) one of the funniest contemporary humorists,
  McManus's (4) droll style is a (5) side-splitting experience.</p>

  <p class="main"><em>Problems:</em> (1) Judgmental; assumes the reader's
  reaction. (2) Possibly misleading; the cautions are
  intended to be funny, not to give directions. (3) Is
  there a consensus and a ranking? The phrase adds
  nothing about the book, and its accuracy is hard to
  determine; one or two favorable reviews do not justify
  such a sweeping statement. (4) Droll is a descriptive
  adjective meaning that the author wanted to provoke
  laughter. It's useful to know the author's
  intentions; no problem here. (5) The writer liked the
  book, but that doesn't count. It's judgmental to say
  the author succeeded in his intention to be funny;
  that's up to the reader to decide.</p>
  
  <p class="main"><em>Comment:</em> Overall, the annotation says a lot about
  what other people think. The only information on
  content is that the book is about camping reminiscences.
  There should be more feeling for the content,
  not merely commentary on it. The language can
  show that the book is funny without saying so. Note
  that the editor will have to go back to the source
  material to obtain content examples.</p>

  <p class="main"><em>Edited/rewritten:</em> Twenty-seven droll sketches that
  originally appeared in <cite>Field and Stream</cite>. Dealing primarily
  with camping reminiscences, they poke fun at
  the author's experiences with an inept hunting dog,
  intruding cows, ne'er-do-well companions, and a
  national park.</p>
</div>


<h4>Controversial subjects</h4>

<p class="main">More dangerous is taking a position on controversial subjects.
Proponents of opposing positions could rightfully
expect equal space and support.</p>

<div class="mainindent">
  <p class="title">Origins</p>
  <p class="by">by Richard E. Leakey and Roger Lewin</p>
  <p class="main"><em>Annotation:</em> (1) This book has been described as
  the best work on man's origins and development. The
  authors explain the emergence of man out of Africa
  and into modern life. (2) Some new approaches
  (3) to controversial topics are discussed, such as the
  growth of intelligence, the nature of man, and the
  names of species.</p>
  
  <p class="main"><em>Problems:</em> (1) The statement, which could reflect
  a single reviewer's opinion, seems to be a strong
  endorsement of the book and the positions taken.
  (2) What new approaches? The premise and conclusion
  are missing. Also, approaches remain new only
  until the next book on the subject is written: avoid
  words about timeliness. (3) Sources indicate that the
  controversy is about cooperation as opposed to
  aggression; the areas listed are details of that. A
  statement is needed about the authors' stand on this
  subject.</p>
  
  <p class="main"><em>Comment:</em> The NLS collection contains books by
  prominent anthropologists who take different or
  opposing positions. If the subject is controversial, the
  Library of Congress can't appear to promote one
  point of view.</p>
  
  <p class="main"><em>Rewritten:</em> Explains the emergence of man out of
  Africa and into modern life. Some controversial topics
  are discussed, such as the growth of intelligence,
  the nature of man, and the names of species. The
  authors consider cooperation and social organization
  more significant in human development than aggression.
  (Note that the purist might prefer <em>humans</em>,
  <em>humankind</em>, or <em>human beings</em> to the use of <em>man</em>. Any
  of these words are appropriate, but less forceful in
  this context. It's a judgment call.)</p>
</div>

<h4>The author's opinion</h4>

<p class="main">Most dangerous of all is expressing the author's opinion as
that of the Library of Congress. Be sure the annotation
explains that the thesis is the author's.</p>

<div class="mainindent">
  <p class="title">The Zapping of America</p>
  <p class="by">by Paul Brodeur</p>
  <p class="main"><em>Annotation:</em> (1) The dangers of microwave radiation
  have been covered up by numerous government
  agencies. (2) The author exposes the inherent dangers
  of microwaves. His examples range from the
  (3) seemingly benign microwave oven to the (4) wellpublicized
  (5) intentional irradiation of embassy
  officials in Moscow.</p>
  
  <div class="box">Opinion should be those of the author</div>
  
  <p class="main"><em>Problems:</em> (1) That's a rather sweeping statement
for a government agency to make about other government
agencies! (2) Wrong placement in the annotation;
should come first as the main emphasis.
(3) Questionable modifier; <em>benign</em> means harmless
only in medical parlance. Its more common definitions
include of gentle disposition, gracious, and
kindly&mdash;terms more appropriate to people than
objects. (4) Modifier that time may erase. The publicity
occurred before the book was written and long
before the book was published. By the time the book
is recorded, distributed to network libraries, and
available to readers, the publicity may be long forgotten.
(5) Modifier that must be considered for
accuracy; the intention is unproved at the time of
writing. However, the assumption is the author's and
listed as his example. To remove it would not reflect
the content of the book.</p>

<p class="main"><em>Edited:</em> Exposes the inherent dangers of
microwaves. The author claims that the hazards
posed by microwave radiation have been covered up
by numerous government agencies. His examples
range from the household microwave oven to the
intentional irradiation of embassy officials in
Moscow.</p>
</div>

<h3>Does the annotation describe the book?</h3>

<p class="main">Read the annotation and consider the content the annotation
describes. What can readers expect the book to be
like?</p>

<p class="main">Now go to the background material-reviews, the book
cover, and the table of contents. Flip through the book and
scan for tone and approach. Is this the same book? If not,
editing is not sufficient; rewriting is needed.</p>

<div class="mainindent">
  <p class="title">The Ecstasy of Owen Muir</p>
  <p class="by">by Ring Lardner Jr.</p>
  <p class="main"><em>Annotation:</em> Ironic novel of a young American and
  seeker of truth who is sent to prison for pacifism.
  Later he joins the army, is wounded, and [is] discharged.
  He then launches himself in a business
  career, marries his secretary, and converts to her religion
  of Catholicism. Eventually they part and he
  joins a monastic order. Some strong language.</p>
  
  <div class="box">Can the reader tell what he is ordering?</div>  
  
  <p class="main"><em>Problem:</em> The annotation covers plot-exhaustively.
  The background material indicates that what happens
  isn't of primary importance; the point is what
  the author thinks about situations described. Because
  the author is one of the creators of M*A*S*H, the
  background material is very likely to be correct.
  <em>Ironic novel</em> is useful, but it isn't strong enough or
  long enough to balance all that plot. More research is
  needed.</p>
  <p class="main"><em>Rewritten:</em> Satiric novel about a young American
  truth-seeker who is sent to prison for pacifism. Later
  episodes with the army, in a business career, and in
  a monastic order provide vehicles for slashing commentary
  on war, racism, big business, and organized
  religion. Some strong language.</p>

  <p class="title">Emma Watson: The Watsons Completed</p>
  <p class="by">by Joan Aiken</p>
  <p class="main"><em>Annotation:</em> Aiken completes this story of the
  Watsons begun by Jane Austen in 1804. After living
  with an aunt for fourteen years, Emma, the youngest
  of a large family, returns home. It falls to Emma and
  her favorite sister, Elizabeth, to deal with the <strong>foibles
  of their siblings, including an elopement, a fatal
  accident, and the revelation of an old scandal.</strong></p>
  <p class="main"><em>Comment:</em> The editor's attention should be caught
  immediately by <em>foibles</em> (oddities of personality) followed
  by three plot elements that seem much more
  than peccadillos. Checking the source material
  shows that the main point&mdash;the dreary prospect for
  two dowerless women&mdash;has been omitted. The sisters
  do, however, deal with <em>foibles</em>, as well as events, and
  assigning these to people catches the spirit of the
  book.</p>
  <p class="main"><em>Rewritten:</em> Aiken continues a novel begun by Jane
  Austen in 1804. After living with an aunt for fourteen
  years, Emma, the youngest of a large family,
  returns home to face a spinsterhood of genteel poverty
  with her favorite sister, Elizabeth. It falls to them
  to deal with the foibles and misadventures of their
  siblings, assorted relatives, and eccentric neighbors.</p>
</div>
<p class="main">Editors should also ask:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Is there enough information?</li>
	<li>Is the emphasis correct?</li>
	<li>Does the information lead to the proper conclusion?</li>
</ul>

<p class="main">Even when all the factual material in an annotation is correct,
the reader can still be misled about the book's content.</p>

<h4>Is there enough information?</h4>

<p class="main">The whole plot does not
need to be there, and should not be there. Too much information
leaves nothing to the reader's imagination and can
be misleading. But there does have to be enough information
for separate parts to make sense together.</p>

  the outbreak of World War I. Assigned to patrol duty
  on an obsolete battle cruiser in the North Sea, he is

  sexy Arab princess.</p>
  <p class="main"><em>Problem:</em> The question is not hard to find: How
  did the Turks and the sexy Arab princess get to the
  North Sea? Either something is missing or more
  explanation is needed. Research shows that quite a
  lot is missing; the book covers most of the major
  naval battles of the war. <em>Startlingly courageous
  adventures</em> sets the tone well, but the rest of the
  annotation needs help.</p>
  <p class="main"><em>Rewritten:</em> The startlingly courageous adventures of
  Midshipman Kelly Maguire of the Royal Navy during
  World War I. At first assigned to patrol duty on an

<h4>Is the emphasis correct?</h4> 
<p class="main">The annotation must highlight
the point of the book. Just listing facts is not sufficient.</p>

  An Interpretive History</p>
  <p class="by">by Robert L. Church and Michael W. Sedlak</p>
  <p class="main"><em>Annotation:</em> A chronological social history of
  American educational ideas and institutions, from
  the Revolutionary War (1) to the present. A number
  of topics are discussed including the role of schools
  in American society, (2) equality in education, and
  the (2) drive to preserve the status quo in social
  inequality.</p>
  <p class="main"><em>Problems:</em> (1) Phrase indicating currentness of the
  book. (2) The last two phrases seem contradictory.
  They do reflect the book's content, but tying them
  together in that form does not show how the authors
  approached the subjects. The contradiction needs to
  be emphasized, not ignored.</p>
  <p class="main"><em>Edited:</em> Chronological social history of American
  educational ideas and institutions, from the
  Revolution to the 1970s. Discussions cover the role
  of schools in American society. The authors contrast
  the goal of equality in education with the tendency

  <p class="title">The Least of These My Brethren: A Doctor's
  Story of Hope and Miracles on an Inner-City
  AIDS Ward</p>
  <p class="by">by Daniel J. Baxter, M.D.</p>
  <p class="main"><em>Annotation:</em> A physician's account of life and
  death amid the squalor of New York City's largest
  designated AIDS center. Relates (1) the stories of
  drug addicts, prostitutes, and other social outcasts
  (2) who are facing death with AIDS. (3) In spite of it
  all, the author affirms his belief in the value of
  human life. Strong language. 1997.
</p>  
  <p class="main"><em>Problem:</em> This one falls apart in the middle with
  weak and vague words that do not develop the point
  being made about the ward itself and almost impossible
  conditions. (1) <em>Stories of</em> generally implies
  background information about individuals, while the
  point here is their attitudes in the ward. (2) We
  already know they are facing death; this space can be
  better used. (3) <em>In spite of it all</em> is a cliché; <em>it all</em>
  needs clarification. For proper emphasis, the annotation
  has to build from <em>squalor</em>, a well-chosen word,
  through frustration to affirmation.</p>
  <p class="main"><em>Rewritten:</em> A physician's account of life and death
  amid the squalor of New York City's largest AIDS
  center. Relates the difficulties of providing care for
  uncooperative drug addicts, prostitutes, and other
  social outcasts. Despite all the hardships and frustrations,
  the author affirms his belief in the value of

</div>

<p class="main">Note the subtle difference made by inserting <em>every</em> before
<em>human life</em>, changing the focus from a generality to the
individuals, <em>even the least of these</em>, of the title. The title
also identifies the author as a doctor, making the M.D. after
his name and physician's in the first sentence unnecessary.</p>

<h4>Is the reader led to the proper conclusion?</h4> 

<div class="box">Nature and scope of the book</div>

<p class="main">The proper
conclusion is what the book is all about, not about how it
begins or how it ends. It also includes the tone of the book:
serious, humorous, folksy, or frightening.</p>

<div class="mainindent">
  <p class="title">Waxwork</p>
  <p class="by">by Peter Lovesey</p>
  <p class="main"><em>Annotation:</em> In the 1880s, Detective Sgt. Cribb of
  Scotland Yard methodically investigates the case of a
  proper Victorian lady who confesses to poisoning her
  photographer husband's assistant because she was
  being blackmailed. <strong>Upon close examination of her
  statement, an impossible detail reveals her confession
  to be false.</strong></p>
  <p><em>Problem:</em> The background material says that <em>the
  impossible detail</em> is what got the detective interested
  and later mentions a surprise ending. Research
  shows that the detail was carefully contrived to
  negate the confession. She did it! The ending can't
  be revealed to readers, and they can't be given the
  impression that the false confession was the end of
  the matter. There are also some style, tense, and
  wordiness problems.</p>

</div>

<p class="main">Usually you can correct problems in the same way that you
add interest: by rearranging language or elements, inserting
more precise and descriptive words, eliminating wordiness,
adding or deleting facts to achieve conciseness and balance.</p>
<p class="main">If the annotation is too far off the mark, it will have to be
rewritten. There is no way to edit annotations that are all
judgment and no content.</p>
<div class="group">
  <p class="mainindent"><em>Annotation:</em> This is one of the best stories that has
  been written by an American about a ballerina.</p>
  <p class="mainindent"><em>Problem:</em> Yes, but what is the book about? What

</div>

<p class="main">When the general content is interesting, describes the book,
and is correct grammatically and stylistically, the editor can
move on to the final step.</p>

<h3>Are the facts accurate?</h3>

<p class="main">Take one last look at names, dates, and places. Too much
work has gone into all this to leave a silly mistake. Some
annotations present reasons to check.</p>

<div class="group">

  teamed with his wife, Gracie Allen, as Burns and
  Allen. Also examines Burns's career resurgence <strong>in
  1976 with his Oscar-winning performance in <cite>Oh

  <p class="main"><em>Comment:</em> Except to a dedicated Burns fan or
  movie buff, this statement would not arouse editorial
  instincts. However, the reviews attribute the Oscar
  (as supporting actor) to an earlier film. Checking
  with the book is warranted and reveals that casting
  Burns as God followed and was because of the previous
  role. The book jacket obscures this point, but all
  the other sources, including the book itself, are clear.
  The statement should read <em>in 1975 with his Oscarwinning
  performance in</em> The Sunshine Boys.</p>

<h3>Back to basics</h3>

<p class="main">Before leaving the entry, take a last look to be sure that all
the material is consistent: names should correspond to the
source information and be spelled the same throughout,
including in the title and author lines and the one-liner (See
One-line annotation, p. 165); places should be spelled correctly
and consistently at each reference. Look again at subject
and verb agreement and parallel structure. Check again
that words other than names are spelled correctly; the eye
often sees what it expects to be there, especially when its
attention has been caught by other problems.</p>
