    <td colspan="2"><p>LEVIN. Mr. President, today I rise, as many do this month, to join in the nationwide recognition of African American History. Every February, the nation joins in the celebration of the sacrifice, perseverance, and advancement of African Americans. The idea of an African American History Month was proposed by Dr. Carter G. Woodson, a son of former slaves. Dr. Woodson, who became a prominent scholar in African American studies, worked tirelessly to ensure that the contribution of African Americans would not be forgotten.      <P>
In an article written for Johnson's Publications, Lerone Bennett tells us that one of the most inspiring and instructive stories in African American history is the story of Woodson's struggle and rise from the coal mines of West Virginia to the summit of academic achievement:   <blockquote>  At 17, the young man who was called by history to reveal Black history was an untutored coal miner. At 19, after teaching himself the fundamentals of English and arithmetic, he entered high school and mastered the four-year curriculum in less than two years. At 22, after two-thirds of a year at Berea College [in Kentucky], he returned to the coal mines and studied Latin and Greek between trips to the mine shafts. He then went on to the University of Chicago, where he received bachelor's and master's degrees, and Harvard University, where he became the second Black to receive a doctorate in history. The rest is history -- Black history.  </blockquote>  Mr. President, it is important to honor the legacy of Dr. Woodson and other African American pioneers who led the advancement of African Americans in a nation once lacking in humanity towards them. In the spirit of honoring those legacies, I pay homage to two women, claimed by my home state of Michigan, who played pivotal roles in the struggle for civil rights and human rights. Sojourner Truth and Rosa Parks were women of different times, yet similar courage, and effectively raised awareness for the inequality and injustice of their eras.  Both have been recently honored by Congress.  It was my privilege to cosponsor legislation, enacted on December 20, 2006, authorizing a bust of Sojourner Truth to be prominently displayed in the United States Capitol, and it was also my privilege to cosponsor legislation, signed into law on December 1, 2005, which directs the Architect of the Capitol to place a statue of Rosa Parks in National Statuary Hall of the United States Capitol. Sojourner Truth and Rosa Parks will become the first African American women to be represented in this place of honor of notable people of History.    <P>
Mr. President, These are truly two phenomenal women not just in African American History, but in American History.  Sojourner Truth, although unable to read and write, was widely accepted as one of the most effective spokespersons of her time. She spoke eloquently and energetically about the inhumanity and immorality of slavery. Truth also worked toward other social goals, especially women’s rights.  In 1851, she delivered her famous “Ain’t I a Woman?” speech at the historic Women’s Convention in Akron, Ohio. Sojourner Truth attacked both racist and sexist notions during her speech when she said, “Then that little man in back there, he says women can’t have as much rights as men, ‘cause Christ wasn’t a woman? Where did your Christ come from? From God and a woman! Man had nothing to do with Him.”    <P>
Sojourner Truth settled in Battle Creek, Michigan during the mid-1850’s. She traveled throughout the state during the Civil War to collect food and clothing for African-American volunteer units. Truth also traveled to Washington, D.C. in 1864 to meet with President Abraham Lincoln. Truth became a close advisor to the President on assisting freed slaves. While in Washington, Truth also appeared at women’s suffrage gatherings.  As a result of illness, Sojourner Truth returned to Battle Creek in 1875.     <P>
Born Isabella Baumfree in 1797, she died Sojourner Truth in 1883.  Although she was born in chains, her legacy lives in fame. Michigan honored Sojourner Truth and her extraordinary legacy with the dedication of the Sojourner Truth Memorial Monument.  Located in Battle Creek, Michigan, this Monument was unveiled on September 25, 1999.      <P>
On November 2, 2005, I joined over 4,000 mourners at Greater Grace Temple to celebrate the life of Rosa Parks at her funeral in Detroit, Michigan.  Just a few days earlier, Rosa Parks became the first woman in the history of the United States to Lie in Honor in the Capitol Rotunda.  And, a few years earlier on June 15, 1999, Rosa Parks was presented with the highest honor of Congress, the Congressional Gold Medal. The actions of Rosa Parks merit such honor, as her silent resistance to the humiliation and demoralization of racial segregation sparked the Civil Rights Movement.  Over fifty one years ago in Montgomery, Alabama, she refused to give up her seat and move to the back of the bus. The strength and spirit of this courageous woman and her act of peaceful rebellion captured the conscience of the American people and the world. For Rosa Parks, this was but a small part of a lifetime of struggle for equality and justice. In fact, twelve years earlier, Rosa Parks had been arrested for violating another segregation law, which required African Americans to pay their fares at the front of the bus, then exit and re-enter at the rear door. The driver of that bus was the same driver that would order Rosa Parks to the back of the bus in December of 1955.    <P>
The boycott of the bus system in Montgomery was a direct result of Rosa Parks’ actions, which sparked a movement that called attention to the plight of African Americans nationwide and introduced the world to the Civil Rights Movement and its young leader, who would one day have a national holiday declared in his honor, Reverend Martin Luther King Jr.    <P>
Mr. President, we have come a long way toward achieving justice and equality for all. But we still have work to do. We must rededicate ourselves to continuing the  struggle for Civil Rights and human rights. <P></p></td>
