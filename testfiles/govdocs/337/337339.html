            <p>Current dental adhesives systems are characterized by the complexity 
              of their compositions and bonding procedures. Bonding protocols 
              for applying a variety of adhesive agents often are technique sensitive, 
              labor intensive and multi-step in nature. In order to cleanse debris 
              (smear layer) from the surfaces of prepared teeth and condition 
              these substrates to accept adhesive agents, many dental adhesive 
              systems use strongly acidic etchants, e.g., aqueous phosphoric acid. 
              These aggressive conditioners have a propensity to over-etch mineralized 
              tissues, especially dentin which is not as highly mineralized as 
              enamel and, consequently, lacks the superior buffering capacity 
              of the latter. Many bonding protocols require rinsing and drying 
              of the conditioned surface. Conditioning dentin with strong acids 
              removes the smear layer, demineralizes peritubular and intertubular 
              dentin and creates a micro-porous surface into which adhesive agents 
              can diffuse. However, these conditioners have the potential of also 
              damaging subsurface dentin and reducing the strength and/or durability 
              of the adhesive interface. </p>
            <p>Recent studies at NIST have shown that N-phenyliminodiacetic acid 
              (PIDAA), a unique imino diacid of moderate acidity (pH=2.5) with 
              excellent chelation potential for calcium, can be used as a dentin 
              conditioner. Not only does PIDAA remove the smear layer and create 
              a micro-porous surface without excessive demineralization or the 
              need for aqueous rinsing, it also has the ability to prime the surface 
              for effective interfacial polymerization. Thus, PIDAA combines several 
              functions in one adhesive agent: substrate conditioning for infiltration 
              and surface activation for polymerization. Several, simplified, 
              two-step dentin bonding systems based on PIDAA have been developed. 
              However, there is a need for a self-etching primer that is effective 
              not only with dentin but also with enamel, that is a “total” self-etching 
              primer. PIDAA itself is only marginally effective as a self-etching 
              primer for enamel. In a recently completed study we have shown that 
              the addition of small quantities of strong acids such as nitric 
              acid to PIDAA solutions results in effective “total” self-etching 
              primers. SEM analysis of enamel treated with PIDAA primers showed 
              that effective surface etching occurred (See Figures 1 and 2).</p>
            <p>For assessing shear bond strength to bovine enamel and human dentin, 
              a two-step bonding protocol was used: 1) aqueous acetone (1:1 by 
              mass ratio) solutions of PIDAA (6.4 %) and nitric acid (NA) at two 
              concentrations (2.5 % or 1.25 %) were applied to either bovine enamel 
              or human dentin surfaces for either 30 s or 60 s, rinsed with distilled 
              H2O and air dried. 2) Five coats of 20 % photoactivated PMGDM (a 
              carboxylic acid containing monomer, pyromellitic glycerol dimethacrylate) 
              in acetone, were then applied and light cured 20 s prior to placement 
              of a photocurable composite (irradiation time=60 s). All % values 
              represent mass fractions.</p>
