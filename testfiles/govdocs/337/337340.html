<p align="center"><font size="5"><strong>Technical Activities:
DENTAL AND MEDICAL MATERIALS</strong> </font></p>

<p>The Dental and Medical Materials Program provides basic
materials science, engineering, test methods, and standards to
sectors of the health-care industry for the development of new or
improved materials and delivery systems. The focus of this
program is the development of improved dental restorative
materials with greater durability, wear resistance and clinical
acceptability. </p>

<p>Dental restorative composites are heterogeneous materials
having three essential phases: (1) a polymeric matrix which
comprises the continuous phase, (2) fillers of various types,
sizes, shapes and morphologies which constitute the disperse
phase and (3) an interfacial phase that, in varying degree, bonds
the continuous and disperse phases into a unitary material rather
than a simple admixture. While all three phases are important in
determining the properties of the composites, this program is
focused primarily on the interfacial and polymer matrix phases.
Since the polymerization shrinkage that occurs in the matrix
phase is one of the most commonly cited deficiencies of dental
restorative composites, resources are allocated to develop high
conversion, durable, low shrinkage polymeric materials for use in
dental resin and composite applications. The polymeric matrix of
a dental composite typically is formed by free radical
polymerization of a resin which is one or more vinyl monomers,
usually of the methacrylate class. Polymerization is started
either by the formation of initiating radicals from chemical
reduction-oxidation( redox) reactions or by photochemical redox
reactions. </p>

<p>Although only a minor component of these composites, the
interfacial phase that develops from the interaction of the
silane coupling agent with the polymer matrix and the siliceous
filler exerts a profound effect on the properties of the
composites. Because these composites are used in an aggressive,
aqueous environment that constantly challenges the vulnerable
silane mediated polymer-filler bond, understanding of this
critical interfacial phase is being acquired so that strategies
can be developed for its improvement. </p>

<p>The occupational and environmental hazards associated with the
use of mercury-containing dental alloys are a recurring source of
public concern. Since dental amalgams have performed exceedingly
well over more than one hundred years, the development of a
direct filling material still based on the common constituents of
dental amalgams, other than mercury, is desirable. The approach
is based on three main premises: (1) the cold-welding of
oxide-free silver; (2) the<em> in situ</em> formation of Ag<sub>x</sub>Sn<sub>y</sub>
intermetallics by the room temperature fast diffusion of silver
and tin; and (3) the homogeneous precipitation of silver by
Sn(II) in solution. This project is focused on acid-assisted
consolidation of chemically precipitated silver powders and
property measurements of hand consolidated test compacts prepared
with the tools and procedures normally employed by dentists. The
observed values of flexural strength for the silver compacts were
equal or superior to mercury amalgams. Corrosion resistance,
microleakage and marginal toughness values of the compacts were
found to be superior to those of amalgams. Wear and
biocompatibility studies on the hand consolidated compacts are in
progress. </p>

<p>Dental research directions in support of the goals are
established in collaboration with the American Dental
Association(ADA), the National Institute of Dental Research, and
guest scientists from the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Public Health
Service. NIST has hosted research associates from ADA since 1928.
Currently, the ADA Health Foundation sponsors 32 research
associates at NIST. The collaborative relationship between that
professional association and the federal government is unique,
and continues to develop and transfer important new technologies
to dentistry and medicine. </p>

<p><strong>Dental Polymers Designed with Minimal Polymerization
Shrinkage, Residual Vinyl Content and Water Sorption.</strong> </p>

<p><strong>Jeffrey W. Stansbury</strong> </p>

<p><strong>Objective</strong> </p>

<p>The objective is to develop dental composite restoratives that
provide improved performance in specific areas where current
dental materials have acknowledged deficiencies. Deficiencies
include excessive polymerization shrinkage, the lack of long term
durability, and susceptibility to moisture. </p>

<p><strong>Technical Description</strong> </p>

<p>Through appropriate monomer design, the resin phase of the
dental composites can undergo efficient photopolymerization with
minimal shrinkage. A reduction in the volume contraction
associated with polymerization is necessary to avoid excessive
internal stresses that result in both micro and macro defects in
dental composites. The lack of long-term durability of dental
composites compared with amalgam restorations requires that
material modifications be made in the polymeric and interfacial
phases of composites, which are the weak links in this regard. </p>

<p>There is need for more hydrophobic, more hydrolytically stable
polymers and interfacial layers to enhance the resistance of
composite restoratives to the challenging oral environment. </p>

<p>The use of ring-opening spiro orthocarbonate (SOC) monomers,
which can produce expansion during polymerization, and monomers
with bulky spacer groups that limit the density of reactive
groups can provide photocurable resins that offer low shrinkage
and good mechanical strength properties. The introduction of
organofluorine substituents in the monomers allows the formation
of inert polymers that repel not only water, but a wide range of
chemicals that can potentially degrade or stain polymer-based
dental restorations. Structural alterations to increase the
hydrophobicity of the coupling agent used to fuse the resin
matrix with the reinforcing filler particles can improve the
strength and stability of dental composites. </p>

<p><strong>External Collaborations</strong> </p>

<p>Dr. Kyung Choi is actively advancing the work with fluorinated
resins and modified coupling agents under a NIDR-supported
contract between NIST and the University of California, Irvine. </p>

<p><strong>Planned Outcomes</strong> </p>

<ul>
    <li>Development of visible light photocurable dental resins
        with less than half the polymerization shrinkage of
        conventional materials. Expect these new monomers to
        provide low shrinkage polymers with less residual stress
        and minimized polymerization-induced defects.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Development of organofluorine containing dental
        composites with less than 1/10th the water uptake of
        conventional materials. Expect more durable composites
        that retain their excellent initial properties during
        prolonged exposure to challenging environments.</li>
    <li>Development of more hydrolytically stable coupling agents
        for use in dental composite restoratives. Expect more
        inert composites with improved initial properties and
        better retention of these properties upon long-term
        storage in water.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Accomplishments</strong> </p>

<p>An examination of the photopolymerization of SOC monomers
(cured by a cationic mechanism) with methacrylate-based
comonomers (cured by a free radical process) has provided details
on the simultaneous formation of very low shrinkage
interpenetrating polymer networks. Multifunctional SOC oligomers
were used to produce highly crosslinked, ring-opened polymers
with expansion. </p>

<p>A computer modeling study has been conducted to screen
prospective monomers for predicted shrinkage based on the solvent
excluded molecular volume of the monomers. Large differences in
molecular volumes were found for monomers with very similar
molecular weights. The predicted monomeric molecular volume
proved to be a better indicator of actual polymerization
shrinkage than monomer molecular weight. </p>

<p>A previous investigation demonstrated that very high strength,
hydrophobic polymers can be prepared from urethane-based
fluorinated monomers. The role of the urethane functionality to
promote polymer mechanical strength (via extended hydrogen
bonding networks) while minimizing the hydrophilic tendency of
these polar groups was examined. A new coupling agent, which is
more compatible with the fluorinated resins, was evaluated and
found to provide surface coverage that is more hydrophobic and
more durable than that obtained with the conventional silane
coupling agent used in dental composites. </p>

<p>An efficient method to produce functionalized methacrylates
was developed. The monomers obtained can be used directly as
bonding agents for the adhesion of dental restoratives to dentin
or they can be further modified through the hydroxy functional
groups to produce new crosslinkable monomers that exhibit
unusually high reactivity during photopolymerization. </p>

<p><strong>Dental Composites With Improved Interfaces</strong> </p>

<p><strong>Joseph M. Antonucci</strong> </p>

<p><strong>Objective</strong> </p>

<p>The objective is to develop polymeric dental composites with
enhanced interfacial strength and durability. </p>

<p><strong>Technical Description</strong> </p>

<p>It is expected that improvements in the quality of the
interfacial phase along with similar improvements in the polymer
matrix and filler phases will result in dental composites of
improved performance and service life. In addition to the use of
traditional mechanical tests as a means of measuring interfacial
strength, two single-fiber tests, the single-fiber fragmentation
and the microbond test, have also been used to assess interfacial
behavior. Attempts to utilize the single-fiber fragmentation test
to determine the strength and durability of the interface derived
from dental polymers and variously treated glass fibers have
generally met with limited success due to the premature fracture
of the brittle polymeric matrices. By contrast, the microbond
test has proved to be a useful method for assessing polymer-fiber
shear bond strengths and, generally, for exploring the
interaction of dental polymers and silane coupling agents with
silica surfaces. Recent studies indicate that the microbond test
can also be used as a durability test and can be adapted for use
with substrates other than fibers. </p>

<p><strong>Accomplishments</strong> </p>

<p>It was demonstrated that 10-methacryloxydecyltrimethoxysilane,
a more hydrophobic silane coupling agent than the widely used
3-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (MPTMS), generates a more
durable interface than MPTMS. </p>

<p>The microbond test was adapted for use with flat glass
surfaces that are potentially more amenable for surface analysis
than fiber glass substrates. </p>

<p>Facile methods for the synthesis of multifunctional acrylic
substituted silsesquioxanes were developed. These novel hybrid
organic-inorganic resins are expected to find use in composite,
sealant and adhesive dental applications. </p>

<p><strong>Improved Adhesive Systems for Bonding to Tooth
Structure</strong> </p>

<p><strong>Joseph M. Antonucci</strong> </p>

<p><strong>Objectives</strong> </p>

<p>The overall objective of this project is to develop effective,
less technique- sensitive adhesive systems for bonding to dentin
and other dental substrates. An ancillary objective is to
elucidate the mechanisms involved in bonding to dentin by means
of <em>N</em>-aryl--amino acids and <em>N</em>-arylimino acids. </p>

<p><strong>Technical Description</strong> </p>

<p>Previously, it was shown that the application of aqueous
acetone solutions of <em>N</em>-phenyliminodiacetic acid (PIDAA)
to dentin both etches and activates the dentinal surface for
subsequent polymerization of photoactivated adhesive resins. With
this simple two-step bonding protocol strong composite-to-resin
bonds were routinely obtained. Recent studies indicate that this
unique adhesive system can be modified by the addition of silane
coupling agents without adversely affecting its adhesion to
dentin. The presence of silane coupling agents has potential for
mediating adhesion to other dental substrates such as porcelain.
In a related study, the mechanism of initiating polymerization
with <em>N</em>-aryl--amino acids was investigated by mass
spectrometry. In addition, a study was initiated to investigate
the mechanism of diffusion of primers into demineralized dentin
and their role in dentin bonding. </p>

<p><strong>External Collaboration</strong> </p>

<p>Drs. G. E. Schumacher and J. E. Code of the U. S. Public
Health Service and P. S. Bennett of the American Dental
Association Health Foundation's Paffenbarger Research Center
collaborated in the bonding study. The mechanism study involved
collaboration with Dr. M. Farahani of the Paffenbarger Research
Center. Dr. T. Nikaido, a guest researcher from the Tokyo Medical
and Dental University, also participated in the dentin bonding
studies. </p>

<p><strong>Accomplishments:</strong> </p>

<ul>
    <li>Demonstrated that silane agents such as
        3-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane can be successfully
        incorporated in the two component PIDAA adhesive system
        to yield high composite-to-dentin shear bond strengths.</li>
    <li>Demonstrated by mass spectrometric analysis techniques
        that <em>N</em>-aryl--amino acids act as polymerization
        initiators when dissolved in acrylic monomers.</li>
    <li>Demonstrated the <em>N</em>-aryl--amino acids such as <em>N</em>-phenylglycine
        prevent the collapse of demineralized dentinal collagen,
        thereby promoting enhanced interfacial diffusion on
        adhesive resins.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Impacts</strong> </p>

<p>A patent has been issued based on self-etching primers of the <em>N</em>-aryliminodiacetic
acid type. The American Dental Association has licensed this
invention and several companies have shown interest in this
technology. </p>

<p><strong>Polymer-Modified Porous Ceramics: Interpenetrating
Phase Composites for Dental Applications</strong> </p>

<p><strong>Joseph M. Antonucci</strong> </p>

<p><strong>Objective</strong> </p>

<p>The objective is to develop strong, tough interpenetrating
phase composites by the <em>in situ</em> polymerization of
resin-infiltrated porous ceramic structures that are easily
formed by low temperature pyrolysis of ceramic powders coated
with pre-ceramic polymers such as polysiloxanes. </p>

<p><strong>Technical Description</strong> </p>

<p>Conceptually, interpenetrating phase composites are expected
to have enhanced properties compared to either dental ceramics or
traditional dental composites. Previously, it was shown that a
polymer-reinforced interpenetrating composite (IPC) with high
strength properties could be prepared by the <em>in situ</em>
polymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA) within a silanized,
porous ceramic network formed by the low temperature pyrolysis
(&lt;750C) of feldspathic porcelain or alumina powders that had
been coated with a poly(dimethylsiloxane) binder. During the
current phase of this research, the effects of silanization
versus no silanization of the porous ceramic and the influence of
resin composition on the biaxial tensile strength of the IPCs
were investigated. </p>

<p><strong>External Collaboration</strong> </p>

<p>Dr. J. R. Kelly, of the Naval Dental Research Institute and
the Naval Dental School, Bethesda, MD </p>

<p><strong>Accomplishments: </strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>The use of the silane agent
        3-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane had a positive
        effect on the biaxial tensile strength of the IPCs, a
        result similar to that found with traditional dental
        composites. </li>
    <li>The polymerization of infiltrated thermosetting resin
        systems based on MMA and cross-linking difunctional
        methacrylates did not generally enhance the strength of
        alumina-polymer-based IPCs. (This suggests that the role
        of the polymer phase in IPCs and in conventional
        particulate-filled composites may not be equivalent.)</li>

<p><strong>Bioresorbable Polymer-Reinforced Calcium Phosphate
Cements</strong> </p>

<p><strong>Joseph M. Antonucci</strong> </p>

<p><strong>Objective</strong> </p>

<p>The object is to improve the load-bearing behavior of a
biocompatible, self-setting calcium phosphate cement by the
inclusion in its structure of a bioresorbable polymer in fiber
mesh form. </p>

<p><strong>Technical Description</strong> </p>

<p>Hydroxyapatite-forming calcium phosphate cements (CPC) derived
from the reaction of tetracalcium phosphate and dicalcium
phosphate in aqueous media have proven successful in healing
small, non-stress bearing skeletal defects. However, because of
its low tensile strength, CPC is not an appropriate cement for
stress-bearing applications. Polyglactin (a copolymer of glycolic
and lactic acids of the type used in resorbable sutures) in
knitted fiber mesh form was incorporated into the tensile surface
of CPC discs during the setting process. Two sets of control
discs were prepared: (1) unreinforced CPC and (2) heat cured
PMMA, i.e., poly(methyl methacrylate) cements of the type used
for ocular prostheses. The three types of discs were loaded in
biaxial flexure (ring-on-ring) to simulate blunt loading of an
edge-supported cranial prosthesis (mesh surfaces placed in
tension). Work-to-fracture was measured for the discs at a
defined strain following storage in artificial serum for 0-28
days at 37C. </p>

<p>This project involved collaboration with Dr. Ann Sue von
Gonten of the U. S. Army Dental Corps and Dr. J. Robert Kelly of
the U. S. Navy Dental Corps, both of the Naval Dental School in
Bethesda, MD. </p>

<p><strong>Planned Outcomes</strong> </p>

<p>The technology developed in this study has the potential for
extending the biomedical use of the highly biocompatible CPC
developed at the American Dental Association Health Foundation
Paffenbarger Research Center (ADAHF/PRC). A company involved in
the commercialization of CPC has shown interest in this
technology and, in part, because of the promising results of this
study, has agreed to provide some financial assistance (through
the ADAHF/PRC) for this type of research. </p>

<p><strong>Accomplishments</strong> </p>

<p>The results of this study demonstrated the compatibility of
polyglactin fibers with CPC. The 2-D oriented polyglactin fibers
exhibited good adhesion to CPC and resisted biaxial tensile
stresses prior to their hydrolytic degradation. Thus, CPC
reinforced with polyglactin fiber mesh progressed to failure in a
manner consistent with the inelastic behavior of oriented fiber
composites, holding relatively high loads despite the occurrence
of innumerable fracture events. Unreinforced CPC behaved as a
simple brittle material with low fracture toughness. Not
surprisingly the PMMA cement exhibited only minimal change in its
work-to-fracture value after 28 days of immersion. For at least
seven days the fiber mesh-reinforced CPC performed as well as
PMMA. Thus, bioresorbable polymeric fiber-reinforced CPCs show
potential for use in stress-bearing as well as non-stress bearing
biomedical applications. </p>

<p><strong>Measurement Methods for Process Control of Cell
Encapsulation </strong></p>

<p><strong>Francis W. Wang</strong> </p>

<p><strong>Objective</strong> </p>

<p>The objective is to develop measurement methods for monitoring
the encapsulation of cells and enzymes. </p>

<p><strong>Technical Description</strong> </p>

<p>In a commonly used process for encapsulating cells with sodium
alginate, reaction conditions, such as temperature, reaction
time, and amounts of reactants, are controlled to produce
functionalized alginate with varying degrees of attachment of
photopolymerizable functional groups. In addition, the extent of
photo-induced cross-linking of the functionalized alginate is
controlled to produce microcapsules of required porosity. The
method of wavelength-shift fluorescence is used in this project
to monitor the degree of functionalization. This is accomplished
by: (1) synthesizing a mobility-sensitive fluorescent probe which
becomes covalently attached to sodium alginate at a reaction rate
similar to the rate for the attachment of photopolymerizable
functional groups to sodium alginate; (2) adding a trace amount
of the probe to the reaction mixture containing sodium alginate
and other reactants; and (3) measuring the fluorescence spectrum
of the probe as a function of the reaction time. Since the
mobility of the probe molecules decreases upon their attachment
to sodium alginate, the fluorescence wavelength of the probe
decreases with the increase in the attachment of the probe
molecules to sodium alginate. Consequently, the change in the
fluorescence wavelength of the probe is a measure of the degree
of attachment of the photopolymerizable functional groups to
sodium alginate, if the probe has been designed such that its
reactivity with the secondary hydroxy groups of sodium alginate
is comparable to the reactivity of the reactant for attaching
photopolymerizable functional groups to the secondary hydroxy
groups of sodium alginate. Once a correlation is established
between the change in the fluorescence wavelength and the degree
of attachment determined by H-NMR, an absolute value for the
degree of attachment can be obtained from the change in the
fluorescence wavelength. Alternatively, the measured value of the
fluorescence wavelength can be used to compare or maintain the
degree of attachment throughout the functionalization process. </p>

<p>Photo-induced crosslinking of the functionalized alginate can
be monitored in the manner similar to the method described for
monitoring the functionalization. This will be accomplished by:
(1) synthesizing a mobility-sensitive fluorescent probe with a
photopolymerizable moiety which has the same reactivity as the
photopolymerizable functional groups covalently attached to
sodium alginate; (2) adding a trace amount of the fluorescent
probe to the reaction mixture containing the photo-crosslinkable
alginate and other reactants; and (3) measuring the fluorescence
spectrum of the probe as a function of the reaction time. Since
the mobility of the probe molecules is reduced due to their
reaction with the functional groups on sodium alginate, the
fluorescence wavelength of the probe decreases with the increase
in the degree of crosslinking of the alginate. Consequently, the
change in the fluorescence wavelength of the probe is a measure
of the degree of crosslinking. Once a correlation is established
between the change in the fluorescence wavelength and the
porosity of the microcapsules, the porosity can be obtained from
the change in the fluorescence wavelength. Alternatively, the
measured value of the fluorescence wavelength can be used to
compare or maintain the porosity throughout the photo-induced
crosslinking process. </p>

<p><strong>Objective</strong> </p>

<p>The objective of this project is to develop bioactive
polymeric composites with remineralization potential using
various forms of amorphous calcium phosphates (ACP) as the filler
phase. </p>

<p><strong>Technical Description</strong> </p>

<p>Two modified ACP fillers were prepared by sol-gel
precipitation techniques using tetraethoxysilane (silica modified
ACP) and zirconyl chloride (zirconia modified ACP). Visible light
activated acrylic composites based on these fillers prepared and
compared with similar composites based on unmodified ACP as a
filler. <em>In vitro</em> release of calcium and phosphate ions
from the modified ACP composites was monitored by atomic
absorption and UV spectroscopic methods respectively. Mechanical
strength was evaluated by the biaxial flexure test. </p>

<p>Remineralizing polymer based ACP systems are expected to find
use as adhesives, sealants and as base and lining materials. </p>
