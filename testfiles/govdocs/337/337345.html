you walk into your home, drive your car, visit your doctor or hospital, or
indulge in recreation, you will likely come in contact with a product that is
the result of technology first developed by NASA. NASA missions produce
scientific and technical challenges that result in many technological
developments. Since 1976, more than 1,300 documented NASA technologies have
benefited U.S. industry, improved our quality of life and created jobs for
Americans. They are called &quot;spinoffs&quot; as industry has taken the
concept and applied it to commercial products. The Space Shuttle program alone
has generated more than 100 technology spinoffs, utilized by medical,
environmental, automotive, sports, computer and refrigeration markets.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica" size="2">With its engineering focus on
Shuttle processing, Kennedy Space Center has developed materials to improve
various aspects of Shuttle launching and maintenance, including safety. Since
1998, there have been 40 success stories at KSC. Among the more recent are the
development of Molyseal, the Medevac Oxygen System (MOS) and a converter for
fertilizer in 2000; a DNAnalyzer in 1999 and aerogel in 1998.</font></p>
<b><font FACE="Helvetica">
<p align="left">Molyseal, a Non-toxic Coating for Aluminum</p>
</font></b>
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica" size="2">NASA KSC sought to replace
chromate-based coatings used on many of its spacecraft with safer coatings.
Chromate-based conversion coatings are toxic and carcinogenic in nature.
Chromates have been found to cause irritation of the respiratory tract,
dermatitis, asthma and more.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica" size="2">The KSC Materials Science
Division, under a Small Business Innovation Research contract with Lynntech, of
College Station, Tex., developed a molybdate-based con-version coating for
aluminum and aluminum alloys. Referred to as Molyseal, the coating does not
contain chemicals or materials that are hazardous or toxic nor does it raise
health and safety concerns. The coating can be applied by dipping, painting or
spraying in short treatment times at low temperatures.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica" size="2">KSC envisions future NASA use of
Molyseal on Space Shuttle ground support equipment at the launch pad, the Space
Shuttle orbiter, solid rocket boosters and other NASA spacecraft and aircraft.
Industrial applications include aerospace, boilers, air conditioners and
aluminum construction materials.</font></p>
<p align="left"><b><font FACE="Helvetica">A Transportable Oxygen System for
Air-rescue</p>
</font></b>
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica" size="2">Also in 2000, the KSC Biomedical
Office, which had developed the Medevac Oxygen System (MOS), transferred the
technology to the U.S. Air Force. MOS provides a therapeutic oxygen supply to
patients being flown aboard aircraft during a long-haul medevac scenario.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica" size="2">The system was developed to
enable a C-130 astronaut medevac team to treat a Space Shuttle crew in the event
of an emergency. Previously, medevac teams aboard U.S. military aircraft at the
Space Shuttle Transatlantic Abort Landing sites were equipped to handle only
three patients. Shuttle crews are normally larger.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica" size="2">The newly designed MOS can
supply up to four patients, and systems can be &quot;daisy chained.&quot; The
C-130 provides a source of gaseous oxygen at about 400 pounds per square inch (psi)
from its onboard liquid oxygen supply. The pressure of the gaseous oxygen is
reduced by a regulator to 50 psi for distribution to each patient station. A
flow controller and humidifier are provided at each station. The assembly can be
attached to the litter or other patient-carrying device. The output from the
humidifier connects to a no-rebreathing mask.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica" size="2">The entire system is packed and
stored in a durable, plastic, waterproof case divided and padded to prevent
damage during storage and transport.</font></p>

</i></font>
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica" size="2">The MOS can meet needs for
patient oxygen delivery on a variety of airborne and surface platforms.
Applications are envisioned on Hercules C-130 aircraft, C-141 and C-5 military
aircraft, and helicopters.</font></p>
<b><font FACE="Helvetica">
<p align="left">Super Insulation for Space Brought to Homes, Cars</p>
</font></b>
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica" size="2">Imagine your current
refrigerator with expanded storage space but still the same size. This could be
possible through the development of a superinsulation blanket based on a
space-age material called aerogel.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica" size="2">Through a Small Business
Innovation Research contract, Aspen Systems Inc. of Marlborough, Mass.,
responded to NASA’s need for an aerogel-based cryogenic insulation system with
extremely low thermal conductivity that is flexible, durable and easy to use.
The basic form of the insulation system is a blanket composed of aerogel-based
composites and radiation shield layers. The final product can be a blanket,
sheet or clam shell unit. The current primary market for the system is the
cryogenic insulation market. Potential space applications include the Reusable
Launch Vehicle, Space Shuttle upgrades, interplanetary propulsion and life
support equipment.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica" size="2">For the refrigeration market,
the product will allow thinner refrigerator walls, which will increase the
refrigerated volume of the system. For the translucent panel and skylight
market, the product will allow significant light transmissions with a fraction
of the heat loss associated with the competing technologies.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica" size="2">Other potential markets include
household freezers and ovens; offshore oil well underwater pipelines; shipping
containers; refractory insulation for automotive firewalls, floorboards, exhaust
systems, automotive air intake, head liners and race cars; noise suppression
panels for aircraft and acoustic damping insulation for buildings; head phones;
and much more.</font></p>
<b><font FACE="Helvetica">
<p align="left">DNAnalyzer – Cancer Detection Device</p>
</font></b>
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica" size="2">Another medical-related spinoff,
the DNAnalyzer, resulted from a NASA/American Cancer Society partnership, the
Space Station In-Flight Cytometry Project. To help decipher the medical mystery
of why and how microgravity affects the immune system, NASA sought development
of a machine that could separate and examine cells rapidly.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica" size="2">The existing device was too
large – the size of a pool table – to place in an orbiting Space Station, so
the partnership was formed to develop a far more compact flow cytometer. The
resulting hardware could support biomedical experiments aboard the Space Station
while advancing medical knowledge in cancer detection and treatment on Earth.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica" size="2">A Miami, Fla., business, RATCOM,
Inc., pioneered the new triangular flow cell technology that improves resolution
in flow cytometer technology. The cancer-fighting benefits of flow cytometry
include the ability to evaluate cancer cells very early and to determine several
important features, such as the sensitivity of the cancer cells to different
chemotherapy drugs, the ability of the cells to grow, and their capacity for
spreading.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica" size="2">The DNAnalyzer allows better
understanding of the nature of a patient’s tumor, thereby enabling better
treatment. Dr. Awtar Krishan at the University of Miami, who was instrumental in
defining requirements for the instrument, is carrying out studies on the
application of the technology in cancer diagnosis and therapy.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica" size="2">Other potential uses of the new
technology involve early detection of leukemia, chemo-sensitivity studies prior
to chemotherapy, antibody analysis, and detection of pathogenic organisms.</font></p>
<b><font FACE="Helvetica">
<p align="left">Toxic Emissions Converted to Fertilizer</p>
</font></b>
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica" size="2">The newly issued U. S. patent
has an environmental twist. The concept was devised by Clyde Parrish of Dynacs,
Inc., the Engineering Development Contractor (EDC) at KSC, in response to a
request from NASA to eliminate the hazardous waste stream that is captured in a
scrubber when the toxic oxidizer is transferred from storage tanks into rockets
and vice versa. This new scrubber captures nitrogen tetroxide in water where
hydrogen peroxide oxidizes the resulting nitrous acid into nitric acid. The
nitric acid is neutralized with potassium hydroxide to form the product
potassium nitrate – a primary fertilizer material, with fewer impurities than
commercially available fertilizers. The process can be up to 99 percent
efficient.</font></p>
<font FACE="Helvetica" SIZE="1"><i>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="http://www-pao.ksc.nasa.gov/kscpao/nasafact/oxidizer.jpg" width="488" height="324"></p>
<p align="center">The Nitrogen Tetroxide Scrubber (above) has been installed in
the Oxidizer Farm at Launch Pad 39A.</p>
</i></font>
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica" size="2">Plans at KSC call for the
resulting fertilizer to be used on the orange groves that KSC leases to outside
companies. The fertilizer will replace 10 percent of the amount annually
purchased by KSC.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica" size="2">KSC plans to install the system
at all scrubbers, and Cape Canaveral Air Force Station plans to install the
control system at the Titan Launch Complex 40. The control system could also be
used at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California and the White Sands Test
Facility, New Mexico.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica" size="2">The system reduces emissions to
less than 10 percent of previous levels, a plus on which Phoenix Systems
International, Inc. (McDonald, Ohio), the new licensee, wanted to capitalize.
The company anticipates using the NASA technology to apply to at least 40
percent of the country’s coal-, oil-, and gas-fired boilers, and also wants to
establish a joint technology with a sulfuric dioxide (SO2) scrubber
manufacturer.</font></p>

<p align="left">Other Recent KSC Spinoffs</p>
</font></i>
<p align="left"><font FACE="Helvetica" size="2">Advanced Lubricants:</font></b><font FACE="Helvetica" size="2">
Sun Coast Chemicals of Daytona, Inc. (SCCD) is commercializing multiple products
based on a biodegradable, non-toxic lubricant it originally developed to replace
the Space Shuttle Crawler’s standard lubricant. The X-1R Crawler Track
Lubricant (CTL) led to an industrial product line of 19 separate specialty
lubricants. The first three industrial products were:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">• <i>Train Track Lube</i>,
    used to solve wear problems for the Florida Power Corporation’s railroad
    system;</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">• <i>Penetrating Spray Lube (PSL),</i>
    used in applications where spray lubrication was needed for rust prevention;</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">• <i>Biodegradable Hydraulic
    Fluid (BHF)</i>, which has an oxidation life of 10,000 hours. BHF is being
    sold through Motion Industries, the largest industrial maintenance and
    equipment supplier in the U.S., to DuPont Corporation, Kitchens of the Ocean
    processing plant, as well as the sugar, agricultural, pulp and paper,
    forestry and sawmill, marine, mining, and heavy construction industries.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font FACE="Helvetica" size="2">SCCD’s newer retail product
line has targeted the sports market, providing lubricants for gun cleaning,
skates, air tools, fishing reels, bicycles, and an air conditioning retrofit
kit. These spinoff products have been sold in retail stores nationwide.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font FACE="Helvetica" size="2">SCCD is also negotiating with
the television home shopping network QVC to market their products. In addition,
the company is expanding into a marine line of products for boats, new products
for racing cars, motorcycles, and go-carts, along with a multi-use handy pack.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font FACE="Helvetica" size="2">Founded in 1989, SCCD
established its reputation with its first product, X-1R Concentrate Friction
Eliminator, developed for the NASCAR racing circuit, to protect engines and
transmissions from heat and wear damage.</font></p>
<b>
<p align="left"><font FACE="Helvetica" size="2">Automotive Insulation:</font></b><font FACE="Helvetica" size="2">
BSR Products created special thermal protection system materials from the Space
Shuttle Thermal Protection System and used it for NASCAR autos to protect
drivers from extreme heat coming through engine areas.</font></p>
<b>
<p align="left"><font FACE="Helvetica" size="2">Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR):</font></b><font FACE="Helvetica" size="2">
An image process technology used to sharpen the view of Jupiter and Saturn from
Voyager and Mars from the Viking Probe was used by Michael Vannier, M.D., a
former NASA engineer. He recognized the similarity of NASA’s computerized
image processing technology and nuclear magnetic resonance. With KSC’s help he
developed a computer program enabling NMR to scan body tissue for earlier
diagnoses. Dr. Vannier feels that &quot;satellite imaging&quot; has opened a new
window into the human body.</font></p>
<b>
<p align="left"><font FACE="Helvetica" size="2">Parking Garage Automation
System:</font></b><font FACE="Helvetica" size="2"> Merritt Systems developed an
obstacle detection system to ensure that robots avoid collisions in their
workplace. The commercial potential ranges from use in robotic manufacturing
systems to remote hazardous waste cleanup. The technology was also developed for
a parking garage automation system that uses sensors to direct customers to
garages and to control parking conditions.</font></p>

pressure monitors, self-adjusting pacemakers, EKGs, exercise equipment and
ultrasound images, as well as the items listed below.</font></p>
<b>
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica" size="2">Laser Angioplasty:</font></b><font face="Helvetica" size="2">
From laser technology for remote sensing of the ozone layer, Advanced
Inter-dentinal Systems, Irvine, Calif., developed a cool laser that uses
ultraviolet light energy to operate on human tissue.</font></p>
<b>

<b>
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica" size="2">Digital Imaging Breast Biopsy
System:</font></b><font face="Helvetica" size="2"> Goddard Space Flight Center
contracted with Scientific Imaging Technologies, Inc. (SITe) to develop a new
advanced charge coupled device that could be manufactured at lower cost. SITe
applied the NASA-driven enhancements to develop a technique called the LORAD
Stereo Guide Breast Biopsy System, which incorporates SITe’s charge coupled
device as part of a digital camera system that &quot;sees&quot; a breast
structure with x-ray vision.</font></p>
<b>
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica" size="2">Artificial Heart:</font></b><font face="Helvetica" size="2">
The technology used in Space Shuttle fuel pumps led to the development of a
miniaturized ventricular assist pump by NASA and renowned heart surgeon Dr.
Michael DeBakey. The tiny pump – two inches long, one inch in diameter and
weighing less than four ounces – has been successfully implanted into more
than 20 people.</font></p>
<b>
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica" size="2">Diagnostic Instrument:</font></b><font face="Helvetica" size="2">
NASA technology was used to create a compact laboratory instrument for hospitals
and doctors’ offices that more quickly analyzes blood, doing it in 30 seconds
instead of 20 minutes.</font></p>
<b>

Developed for Space Shuttle medical research, this rotating cell culture
apparatus simulates some aspects of the space environment, or microgravity, on
the ground. Tissue samples grown in the bioreactor are being used to design
therapeutic drugs and antibodies. Some scientists believe the bioreactor will
routinely produce human tissue for research and transplantation.</font></p>
<b>
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica" size="2">Infrared Thermometer:</font></b><font face="Helvetica" size="2">
Infrared sensors developed to remotely measure the temperature of distant stars
and planets led to the development of the hand-held optical sensor thermometer.
Placed inside the ear canal, the thermometer provides an accurate reading in two
seconds or less.</font></p>
<b>
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica" size="2">Lifesaving Light:</font></b><font face="Helvetica" size="2">
Special lighting technology developed for plant growth experiments on Space
Shuttle missions is now used to treat brain tumors in children. Doctors at the
Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee use light-emitting diodes in a
treatment called photodynamic therapy, a form of chemotherapy, to kill cancerous
tumors.</font></p>
<b>
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica" size="2">Prosthesis Material:</font></b><font face="Helvetica" size="2">
Responding to a request from the orthopedic appliance industry, NASA recommended
that the foam insulation used to protect the Shuttle’s external tank replace
the heavy, fragile plaster used to produce master molds for prosthetics. The new
material is light, virtually indestructible and easy to ship and store.</font></p>
<b>
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica" size="2">Insulation Pumps:</font></b><font face="Helvetica" size="2">
Implantable and external insulin pumps, which are based on technology used on
the Mars Viking spacecraft, have aided insulin-dependent diabetics. These
computerized pumps can infuse insulin at a pre-programmed rate, allowing more

<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica" size="2">Kidney Dialysis:</font></b><font face="Helvetica" size="2">
Dialysis machines were developed as a result of a NASA-developed chemical
process to remove toxic waste from used dialysis fluid.</font></p>
<b>
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica" size="2">Physical Rehabilitation:</font></b><font face="Helvetica" size="2">
A cardiovascular conditioner developed for astronauts in space led to the
development of a physical therapy and athletic development machine used by
football teams, sports clinics and medical rehabilitation centers.</font></p>
<b>
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica" size="2">Water Purification:</font></b><font face="Helvetica" size="2">
The technology for purifying water, used on the Apollo spacecraft, now is used
to kill bacteria, viruses and algae in community water supply systems and
cooling towers. Also, filters mounted on faucets can reduce lead in water
supplies.</font></p>
<b>
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica" size="2">Vacuum Metallizing Techniques:</font></b><font face="Helvetica" size="2">
These led to an extensive line of commercial products, from insulated outer
garments and packaging for foods, to wall coverings, window shades, life rafts,
candy wrappings, reflective blankets and photographic reflectors.</font></p>
<b>
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica" size="2">Cordless Power Tools:</font></b><font face="Helvetica" size="2">
A NASA requirement during the Apollo program, re-chargeable tools were developed
to permit astronauts to do repairs in space.</font></p>
