	         <li> The principal adverse reactions to cyclosporine therapy are renal dysfunction, tremor, hirsutism, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, & gum hyperplasia. Nephrotoxicity is limiting & occurs in the majority of patients treated. It is the major indication for cessation or modification of therapy. Hypertension may occur in approx 50% of renal transplant & almost all cardiac transplant patients. Combined use of calcineurin inhibitors & glucocorticoids is particularly diabetogenic, with diabetes being more frequent in patients treated with tacrolimus than in those receiving cyclosporine.

	         <li> An adult ingested 25,000 mg over 8 days & survived. Two adults & one child received 5000 mg of cyclosporine each by error & lived. A 37 yr old woman took 7500 mg in a suicide attempt & exhibited few symptoms. A 2 yr old received 240 mg, developed hypotension, wheezing, pallor, & tachycardia, & lived. A neonate received 400 mg/kg, developed cyanosis, metabolic acidosis, respiratory depression, & renal failure, & survived. Oral overdoses form 10-150 mg/kg were reported with only mild signs of toxicity. An adult received, by error, a 250 mg dose of iv cyclosporine in 30 min with ornithine-vasopressin &, within 15 min, developed anxiety & an irregular weak pulse.

	         <li> ... Based on relatively small numbers, the use of cyclosporine during pregnancy apparently does not pose a major risk to the fetus. Cyclosporine is not unlikely to be a human teratogen. No pattern of defects has emerged in the few newborns with anomalies. Skeletal defects, other than single case of osseous malformation, have not been observed. The disease process itself, for which cyclosporine is indicated, makes these pregnancies high risk & subject to numerous potential problems, of which the most common is growth retardation. This latter problem is probably related to the mother's disease rather than to her drug therapy, but a contribution from cyclosporine & corticosteroids cannot be excluded. [Briggs, G.G, R.K.

	         <li> Cyclosporine is excreted into human breast milk, but no reports of its use during breast feeding have been located. ... In another patient, milk concns 22 hr after a dose of 325 mg were 16 ng/ml while maternal blood levels were 52 ng/ml, a milk:plasma ratio of 0.31. A milk:plasma ratio of 0.40 was reported in one study, & a ratio of approximately 0.17 was measured in another. Breast feeding was not allowed in any of these studies & has been actively discouraged by most sources because of concerns for potential toxicity in the nursing infant. The American Academy of Pediatrics considers cyclosporine to be contraindicated during breast feeding due to the potential for immune suppression & neutropenia, an unknown effect on growth, & a possible association with carcinogenesis.

	         <li> Studies in rats and rabbits have shown that cyclosporine is embryotoxic and fetotoxic at doses 2 to 5 times the human dose. At toxic doses (30 mg/kg a day in rats and 100 mg/kg a day in rabbits), cyclosporine was embryotoxic and fetotoxic, as indicated by increased prenatal and postnatal mortality and reduced fetal weight together with related skeletal retardations.

	         <li> ... Since cyclosporin A (CsA)-induced overgrowth seldom occurs at sites distant from teeth, the periodontal ligament has been considered significant. The aim of this study was to examine overgrowth occurrence at the edentulous ridge--the sites without the ligament--after CsA therapy in rats. ... After extracting all right maxillary molars, 16 Sprague-Dawley rats underwent a 2-wk healing period. The animals were separated into CsA & control groups. CsA rats received 15 mg/kg of CsA by gastric feeding for 4 wk, while the control group received only mineral oil. At the end of study, all animals were sacrificed & stone models were immediately obtained by rubber-based impressions. The edentulous ridge morphology, including the bucco-lingual width & the vertical height, was measured on the models. For histometry, 10 sections were selected from the edentulous ridge of each animal after undecalcified tissue preparation. The soft tissue areas of the edentulous ridge & the trabecular bone morphology of the dental alveolus were measured. ... CsA therapy produced a significant incr of the ridge width & height, measured from the stone models, when compared to the control group. Under histometry, CsA resulted in a significant incr of the epithelium, connective tissue, & total soft tissue areas. The measured trabecular bone volume was affected by both examining factors: the drug therapy & the location of the dental alveolus. CsA therapy produced a significant loss of bone volume but a significant incr of the bone-specific surface area. Although the mean osteoid volume was similar between CsA & control groups, a significant decr of the fractional formation surface in the CsA group was revealed. ... An enlarged edentulous ridge & an altered dental alveolar bone morphology were observed in CsA-treated animals at the end of the study; therefore, we suggest that CsA may induce not only a soft tissue overgrowth but also an alveolar bone alteration at the edentulous ridge. The hypothesis that tooth or periodontal ligament is an essential component for the overgrowth development is questioned.

	         <li> ... /The authors/ examined the effect cyclosporine (CsA) & sirolimus (SRL) alone & in combination on hepatic cytochrome P450-mediated metab in rats. ... Rats were given 1 mg/kg of CsA or 0.4 mg/kg of SRL alone or in combination via constant iv infusion. Renal function was evaluated at the end of treatment. Blood samples were obtained to estimate CsA & SRL concns. Hepatic microsomes were prepared for immunoblotting and catalytic assays. ... CsA alone did not alter serum creatinine levels. SRL given alone or in combination with CsA produced a significant incr in urine output without changes in fluid balance. Although CsA & SRL administered alone caused damage to renal proximal tubules, the two-drug combination dramatically increased the renal structural damage. CsA alone suppressed cytochrome p450 (CYP) 3A2 protein levels by 39% (P=0.012) & catalytic activity by 30% (P=0.042). SRL alone reduced catalytic activity by 38% (P=0.012). Combination therapy reduced both CYP3A2 levels by 55% (P<0.001) & catalytic activity by 55% (P=0.001). CYP2C11 protein expression or catalytic activity were not changed in any group. CYP2A1 protein expression & catalytic activity were both significantly reduced in rats given CsA or/& SRL. Steady-state CsA levels were increased during concurrent SRL dosing, however, SRL concentrations were not changed by CsA coadmin. ... /It was concluded that/ concurrent SRL dosing increases CsA concns due to inhibition of hepatic CYP3A2 protein expression. Nephrotoxicity caused by combination therapy is due to CsA elevating levels of SRL or by SRL itself. Concurrent admin of CsA & SRL in transplant patients should be performed with caution.

	         <li> Cyclosporin A (CsA) inhibits the membrane transport protein p-glycoprotein (p-gp) & can enhance the accumulation of vinblastine (VBL) & doxorubicin (Dx) in the inner ear of mice. Pharmacokinetic & functional alterations observed in this study suggest caution in applying these combinations in clinical practice.

	         <li> ... The introduction of cyclosporine (CsA) has led to an improvement in the prognosis of solid organ transplantation. However, drug-induced hypertension & nephrotoxicity, associated with the development of atherosclerosis & coronary heart disease, still worsen the long-term outcome of CsA-treated patients. Whether the CsA-induced myocardial changes are associated with the induction of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), a recently found polypeptide implicated in extracellular matrix synthesis, is not known. ... Spontaneously hypertensive rats (8-9 wks old) were treated with CsA (5 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1) subcutaneously) for 6 wks. The influence of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (enalapril 30 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1) orally) & angiotensin-1 receptor blockade (valsartan 3 & 30 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1) orally) on CsA toxicity was also investigated. Myocardial morphology was examined, & vascular lesions were scored. Localization & the quantitative expression of CTGF, as well as collagen I & collagen III, mRNA were evaluated by in situ hybridization & Northern blot. ... CsA-induced hypertension & nephrotoxicity were associated with myocardial infarcts & vasculopathy of the coronary arteries. CsA increased myocardial CTGF, collagen I, & collagen III mRNA expressions by 91%, 198%, & 151%, respectively. CTGF mRNA expression colocalized with the myocardial lesions. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system prevented vascular damage & the CsA-induced CTGF, collagen I, & collagen III mRNA overexpressions in the heart. ... /It was concluded that/ CsA increases CTGF, collagen I, & collagen III mRNA expressions in the heart. The induction of CTGF gene is mediated, at least in part, by angiotensin II. [Finckenberg P et al; Transplantation 71 (7): 951-958 (2001)]**PEER REVIEWED**<br> </li>
	         <li> ... Hyperuricemia frequently complicates cyclosporine (CSA) therapy. The observation that longstanding hyperuricemia is associated with chronic tubulointerstitial disease & intrarenal vasoconstriction raised the hypothesis that hyperuricemia might contribute to chronic CSA nephropathy. ... CSA nephropathy was induced by the admin of CSA (15 mg/kg/day) for 5 & 7 wks to rats on a low salt diet (CSA group). The effect of hyperuricemia on CSA nephropathy was determined by blocking the hepatic enzyme uricase with oxonic acid (CSA-OA). Control groups included rats treated with vehicle (VEH) & oxonic acid alone (OA). Histological & functional studies were determined at sacrifice. ... CSA treated rats developed mild hyperuricemia with arteriolar hyalinosis, tubular injury & striped interstitial fibrosis. CSA-OA treated rats had higher uric acid levels in association with more severe arteriolar hyalinosis & tubulointerstitial damage. Intrarenal urate crystal deposition was absent in all groups. Both CSA & CSA-OA treated rats had increased renin & decreased NOS1 & NOS3 in their kidneys, & these changes are more evident in CSA-OA treated rats. ... /It was concluded that/ an incr in uric acid exacerbates CSA nephropathy in the rat. The mechanism does not involve intrarenal uric acid crystal deposition & appears to involve activation of the renin angiotensin system & inhibition of intrarenal nitric oxide production.

	         <li> ... Nifedipine (NIF) may aggravate cyclosporin A (CsA)-induced gingival overgrowth because the potentiated gingival overgrowth has been observed in the patients treated with CsA & NIF. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether NIF could aggravate the CsA-induced gingival overgrowth in a rat model. ... Ninety male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 6 groups: the first group received 8 mg/kg of CsA daily by gastric feeding for 6 weeks; the second & third groups received NIF daily at a dosage of 10 or 50 mg/kg; the fourth & fifth groups received CsA (8 mg/kg) & NIF (10 or 50 mg/kg); & the sixth group received solvents as a negative control. Gingival dimensions (including bucco-lingual depth, mesio-distal width, & vertical height) were assessed bi-weekly from impressed stone models of the mandibular incisal region. At the end of the experiment, the animals were sacrificed. Following histopathological procedures, serial horizontal sections were obtained at the base of the central incisal papilla. Two tissue levels were selected for histometric analysis. Level 1 was defined as the point where the lingual gingiva embraced the bucco-lingual midpoint of the roots & the level 2 as the point where the lingual gingiva at the enamel-dentinal junction approximated the bucco-proximal angle of the roots. The bucco-lingual depth and the mesio-distal width of the papilla were recorded on 5 consecutive sections at the 2 levels, respectively. ... At the 6-wk observations, the gingival dimensions (including the depth, width, & height) significantly increased after CsA therapy & the increasing treatment duration; however, only the mesio-distal width increased after NIF therapy. For NIF therapy alone, a positive linear relation was noted by increased NIF treatment dosages in all gingival dimensions at wk 6. But, this relationship was not found in the combined therapies. By histometry, tissue dimensions increased following single drug therapy, either CsA or NIF, at both levels. In animals with the combined therapies, the tissue dimensions decreased if the animals received 10 mg NIF, while they rebounded to control levels with the 50 mg dosage. A dose-dependent positive pattern by NIF was noted in tissue dimensions, but the pattern did not occur in animals that received combined therapy. ... /It was concluded that/ the gingival dimensions increased after CsA or NIF therapy, although they were more prevalent with CsA. But the augmenting pattern in gingival morphology observed with CsA therapy decreased when the animals received additional NIF. Therefore, we question whether NIF is a critical factor in aggravating the CsA-induced gingival overgrowth. [Chiu HC et al; J Periodontol 72 (4): 532-537 (2001)]**PEER REVIEWED**<br> </li>
	         <li> The effect of cyclosporine doses on renal P-glycoprotein expression was examined. Rats were given cyclosporine orally at 2, 10, 30 mg/kg/day or sc at 1, 5, 15 mg/kg/day for 28 days with or without 14 days of additional vehicle dosing. Following cyclosporine dosing, renal function & P-glycoprotein expression were measured. Renal function was reduced in rats receiving oral cyclosporine & the highest sc dose, 15 mg/kg/day. Western blot analysis showed that cyclosporine administered orally at 10 & 30 mg/kg/day & sc at 15 mg/kg/day induced significantly renal P-glycoprotein expression. After discontinuation of cyclosporine, renal P-glycoprotein returned to pre-dosing levels in oral groups, whereas the return was incomplete in sc groups. These results indicate that cyclosporine induces renal P-glycoprotein overexpression a dose-dependent manner. [Liu J et al; Eur J Pharmacol 418 (1-2): 127-132 (2001)]**PEER REVIEWED**<br> </li>
	         <li> Functional & morphological changes of blood vessels in cyclosporine A (CsA)-induced hypertension & nephrotoxicity were studied in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The role of the L-arginine-nitric oxide (NO) pathway & the importance of oxidative stress in CsA toxicity were also assessed. SHR (7-8 wk old) on a high-sodium diet were treated with CsA (5 mg kg(-1) d(-1) s.c.) for 6 wks. A proportion of the rats were treated concomitantly with the NO precursor L-arginine (1.7 g kg(-1)d(-1) p.o.). CsA elevated blood pressure & caused renal dysfunction & morphological nephrotoxicity. CsA also impaired mesenteric & renal arterial function & caused structural damage to intrarenal & extrarenal small arteries & arterioles. Medial atrophy of the mesenteric resistance vessels & decreased viability of smooth muscle cells of the thoracic aorta were observed. Renal & arterial damage was associated with the presence of inflammatory cells. CsA did not affect markers of the L-arginine-NO pathway (urinary cyclic GMP excretion or endothelial or inducible NO synthase expression in kidney, aorta or heart) or oxidative stress (urinary excretion of 8-isoprostaglandin F2alpha, plasma urate concentration or total radical trapping capacity). Concomitant L-arginine treatment did not affect CsA-induced changes in blood pressure or histological findings but tended to alleviate the arterial dysfunction. The renal & cardiovascular toxicity of CsA was associated with arterial dysfunction & morphological changes in small arteries & arterioles in SHR on a high-sodium diet. The findings did not support the role of oxidative stress or a defect in the L-arginine-NO pathway. [Lassila M et al; J Physiol Pharmacol 52 (1): 21-38 (2001)]**PEER REVIEWED**<br> </li>
	         <li> Cyclosporine interacts with a wide variety of commonly used drugs, & close attention must be paid to drug interactions. Any drug that affects microsomal enzymes, especially the CYP3A system, may affect cyclosporine blood concns. Substances that inhibit this enzyme can decr cyclosporine metab & incr blood concns. These include calcium channel blockers (e.g., verapamil, nicardipine), antifungal agents (e.g., fluconazole, ketoconazole), antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), glucocorticoids (e.g., methylprednisolone), HIV-protease inhibitors (e.g., indinavir), & other drugs (e.g., allupurinol & metoclopramide). In addition, grapefruit & grapefruit juice block the CYP3A system & incr cyclosporine blood concns & thus should be avoided by patients receiving the drug. In contrast, drugs that induce CYP3A activity can incr cyclosporine metab & decr blood concns. Drugs that can decr cyclosporine concns in this manner include antibiotics (e.g., nafcillin & refampin), anticonvulsants (e.g., phenobarbital, phenytoin), & other drugs (e.g., octreotide, ticlopidine). In general, close monitoring of cyclosporine blood levels & the levels of other drugs is required when such combinations are used. Interactions between cyclosporine & sirolimus have led to the recommendation that admin of the two drugs be separated by time. Sirolimus aggravate cyclosporine-induced renal dysfunction, while cyclosporine increases sirolimus-induced hyperlipemia & myelosuppression. Other cyclosporine-drug interactions of concern include additive nephrotoxicity when coadministered with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs & other drugs that cause renal dysfunction; elevation in methotrexate levels when the two drugs are coadministered; & reduced clearance of other drugs, including prednisolone, digoxin, & lovastatin.

	         <li> The effects of 1,4-benzodiazepines with various heterocyclic ring structures (triazolo, triazino and imidazo), and of 1,4-benzodiazepines with chlorine substitution in the phenyl ring (4'- chlorodiazepam , 2'- chlorodiazepam and 2'- chloronordiazepam ) were studied on spatial-delayed alternation and delayed matching-to-sample tasks in the monkey. Within the dose range 0.25-0.75 mg kg-1, the triazolo compounds had marked activity, decreasing the number of correct responses and increasing total response time. The triazino was less potent and the imidazo compounds were the least likely to disrupt performance. Smaller doses (0.005, 0.01 and 0.05 mg kg-1) of triazolam did not impair performance on the tasks, and larger doses of imidazo (1.0, 3.0 and 7.5 mg kg-1) were without effect on delayed alternation. Within the dose range 1.0-10.0 mg kg-1, 4'- chlorodiazepam was without effect and only the largest dose of diazepam and 2'- chlorodiazepam impaired performance. 2'- Chloronordiazepam decreased the number of correct responses at all doses (1.0, 3.0 and 10.0 mg kg-1) and with the largest dose, the total response time was increased. The studies suggest that the effects of a drug on higher nervous function in the monkey cannot easily be predicted from standard pharmacological tests in other animals or other species of monkey.

	         <li> Following oral admin of cyclosporine, the time to peak blood concns is 1.5-2.0 hr. Admin with food both delays & decreases absorption. High & low fat meals consumed within 30 min of admin decr the AUC by approx 13% & the max concn by 33%. This makes it imperative to individualize dosage regimens for outpatients. Cyclosporine is distributed extensively outside the vascular compartment. After iv dosing, the steady-state volume of distribution has been reported to be as high as 3-5 liters/kg in solid-organ transplant recipients. Only 0.1% of cyclosporine is excreted unchanged in urine. ... Cyclosporine & its metabolites are excreted principally through the bile into the feces, with only approx 6% being excreted in the urine. Cyclosporine also is excreted in human milk. [Hardman, J.G., L.E. Limbird, P.B. Molinoff, R.W. Ruddon, A.G. Goodman (eds.). Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics. 9th ed.

	         <li> ... Absorption of cyclosporine is incomplete following oral admin. The extent of absorption depends upon several variables, including the individual patient & formulation used. The elimination of cyclosporine form the blood is generally biphasic, with a terminal half-life of 5-18 hr. After iv infusion, clearance is approx 5-7 ml/min/kg in adult recipients of renal transplants, but results differ by age & patient populations. For example, clearance is slower in cardiac transplant patients & more rapid in children. The relationship between admin dose & the area under the plasma concn-vs-time curve is linear within the therapeutic range, but the intersubject variability is so large that individual monitoring is required. [Hardman, J.G., L.E. Limbird, P.B. Molinoff, R.W. Ruddon, A.G. Goodman (eds.). Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics. 9th ed.

	         <li> Clinicians can administer cyclosporine by continuous iv infusion during the first few days after transplantation, then orally by twice-daily doses, to achieve plasma cyclosporine concns (measured by HPLC) of 75-150 ng/ml (equivalent to whole blood cyclosporine concns of 300-600 ng/ml measured by radioimmunoassay). It appears safe to maintain a trough plasma cyclosporine concn of about 75-150 ng/ml; however, this does not necessarily guarantee safety from nephrotoxicity. Because of preferential distribution of cyclosporine & its metabolites into red blood cells, blood levels are generally higher than plasma levels. When blood cyclosporine levels are 300-600 ng/ml by radioimmunoassay, cerebrospinal fluid levels range from 10-50 ng/ml. The apparent volume of distribution in children under 10 yr of age is about 35 l/kg, & in adults, 4.7 l/kg. [Ellenhorn, M.J., S. Schonwald, G. Ordog, J. Wasserberger.

	         <li> The elimination half-life of an oral cyclosporine dose of 350 mg is 8.9 hr; after a 1400 mg dose, the half-life is 11.9 hr. Elimination occurs predominantly by metab in the liver to form 18-25 metabolites. Metabolites of cyclosporine possess little immunosuppressive activity. Cyclosporine is extensively metabolized in the liver by cytochrome P450IIIA oxidase; however, neurotoxicity & possibly nephrotoxoicity usually correlate with raised blood levels of cyclosporine metabolites. Only 0.1% of a dose ix s excreted unchanged. [Ellenhorn, M.J., S. Schonwald, G. Ordog, J. Wasserberger. Ellenhorn's Medical Toxicology: Diagnosis and Treatment of Human Poisoning. 2nd ed.

	         <li> Different cyclosporine concn zones can exist in plasma due to the temperature dependency in distribution & association, therefore cyclosporine therapeutic & toxic effects may partially be related to these concn zones.

Neoral is a microemulsion preconcentrate; a microemulsion is a mixture of the lipophilic active substance with accurately balanced amounts of lipophilic solvent, hydrophilic solvent & surfactant. As the result of advanced microemulsion technique, Neoral has more consistent & improved absorption characteristics. Cyclosporin (cyclosporin A) has been used as an immunosuppressive agent.
