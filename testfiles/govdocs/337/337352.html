<b>NAL Call Number:</b>  QL713.2.M372<br>
<b>Abstract:</b>  Lightweight untethered pneumatic darts were used to biopsy killer whales, <i>Orcinus orca</i>, for genetic and toxicological analysis. Samples of epidermal, dermal, and hypodermal tissue weighing approximately 0.5 g were obtained by 65% of the 91 darts fired during the study. Sufficient DNA for multiple analyses was extracted from the biopsies, which were also used for fatty acid and toxic contaminant analyses. Reactions such as momentary shakes or accelerations were observed after 81% of the dart hits and 53% of the misses. Aversion to the research vessel was assessed by reapproaching target whales after the sampling attempts. In 6% of the hits and 8% of the misses aversion to the research boat increased immediately following the attempt. No similar increases in aversion were seen when killer whales were reapproached one day to one year after being hit. The darts were also tested successfully on humpback whales, <i>Megaptera novaeangliae</i>. In view of the simplicity of the system, its effectiveness in acquiring multipurpose samples, and the apparently short-term disturbance it caused, it is recommended for future cetacean biopsy studies.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  Harbor porpoises from the German North and Baltic Seas exhibit a higher incidence of bacterial infections compared to whales from less polluted arctic waters. The potential adverse effect of environmental contaminants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and heavy metals on the immune system and the health status of marine mammals is still discussed controversially. The aim of the present study was to investigate the possible influence of PCB, polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE), toxaphene, (p,p'-dichlorodiphenyl)trichlorethane (DDT), and (p,p'-dichlorodiphenyl)dichlorethene (DDE) on the immune system of harbor porpoises. Lymphoid organs are influenced by a variety of factors, and therefore special emphasis was given to separating the confounding effect of age, health status, nutritional state, geographical location, and sex from the effect of contaminant levels upon thymus and spleen. Contaminant analysis and detailed pathological examinations were conducted on 61 by-caught and stranded whales from the North and Baltic Seas and Icelandic and Norwegian waters. Stranded harbor porpoises were more severely diseased than by-caught animals. Thymic atrophy and splenic depletion were significantly correlated to increased PCB and PBDE levels. However, lymphoid depletion was also associated with emaciation and an impaired health status. The present report supports the hypothesis of a contaminant-induced immunosuppression, possibly contributing to disease susceptibility in harbor porpoises. However, further studies are needed to determine if lymphoid depletion is primarily contaminant-induced or secondary to disease and emaciation in this cetacean species.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  A 12-gauge shotgun, loaded with either a solid 28 g lead slug or buckshot consisting of nine individual lead pellets with a total mass of 28 g, was used to shoot the heads of one dead common dolphin (<i>Delphinus delphis</i>) and five dead long-finned pilot whales (<i>Globicephala melaena</i>) varying in length from 2.5 m to 5 m. The dolphin and the smallest pilot whale were shot with both projectiles from the dorsal surface of the head. The projectiles penetrated the head and dorsal surface of the skull, but not the base of the cranium. This site using buckshot was not effective in the larger animals. Two whales between 3 and 4 m in length were shot with buckshot through the lateral side of the head caudal to and above the eye, without penetration of the contralateral side of the head. It is concluded that shooting smaller cetaceans with a shotgun can be effective and safe. Further work is required to develop more suitable projectiles for cetaceans up to the size of mature pilot whales.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  An Amazon River dolphin (<i>Inia geoffrensis</i>) developed a dermatologic syndrome characterized by the occurrence of slow-growing, nodular, s.c. abscesses. Initial biopsies, cultures, and cytologic analysis of needle aspirates from the abscesses indicated steatitis with probable secondary, gram-negative bacterial infection. Treatment with dietary vitamin E supplement and broad-spectrum antibiotics yielded minimal improvement. Subsequent cultures revealed <i>Streptococcus iniae</i> in addition to several gram-negative bacteria. Vigorous surgical management of the abscesses, including lancing, debridement, and irrigation, combined with antimicrobial therapy specific for Streptococcus and gram-negative organisms, and improvement of the animal's diet and environmental water quality led to gradual recovery. When the animal was ill, it demonstrated an inflammatory leukogram and transient uremia. <i>Streptococcus iniae</i> is a serious pathogen of aquacultured fishes and humans and should be included in the differential diagnosis of chronic dermatopathy in river dolphins. Specific antimicrobial therapy, excellent water quality, surgical management of abscesses, and adherence to sanitary protocols should be observed in cases of suspected <i>S. iniae</i> infection in dolphins.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  A 16-year-old female white whale, <i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>, died after nearly 18 months of chronic lymphopenia and pyogranulomatous dermatitis. Necropsy revealed rupture of the aorta with hemorrhage into the cranial mediastinum and between fascial planes of the ventral neck musculature. Multiple foci of ulcerative dermatitis and panniculitis were present across the thorax and abdomen and surrounded the genital folds. In addition, there was a chronic proliferative pleuritis with over 20 liters of histiocytic exudate in the thoracic cavity. Acid-fast bacteria consistent with Mycobacterium sp. were identified in sections of skin lesions and in cytospins of pleural exudate. Cultures of pleura and 1 skin lesion collected at necropsy yielded sparse growth of an acid-fast bacillus with colony characteristics and morphology consistent with <i>Mycobacterium marinum</i>. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis confirmed the presence of <i>M. marinum</i> DNA in samples of skin. This is the first documented occurrence of mycobacteriosis in a white whale and is a unique presentation of mycobacterial dermatitis and panniculitis with chronic pleuritis in a cetacean. The improved PCR-RFLP protocol utilized in this case unifies techniques from several protocols to differentiate between species of Nocardia and rapidly growing mycobacteria clinically relevant to aquatic animals.<br>

<b>NAL Call Number:</b>  QP251.J75<br>
<b>Abstract:</b>  Routine ultrasonographic examination of the reproductive tract was performed for periods of up to 10 years in ten female bottlenose dolphins (<i>Tursiops truncatus aduncas</i>) in Hong Kong. The ovaries could be reliably and repeatedly identified, lying close to the body surface, in the angle formed by the rectus abdominus and hypaxialis lumborum muscles, and were most easily located by scanning in the transverse plane from the proximal end of the genital slit towards the head. The ovaries are ovoid, with a relatively hypoechoic cortex around a central echogenic mesovarium. The echogenicity of the ovarian parenchyma appeared to increase with increasing age. This may be the result of age-related changes, such as increased fat deposition or fibrosis, or of ovarian 'scars' from multiple ovulations. Small antral follicles, developing follicles and corpora lutea can be identified within the ovarian cortex. Owing to its shape and lack of a definitive border, plus the close relationship to the intestines, the contents of which may obstruct the ultrasound beam, the non-pregnant uterus was not so easily visualized. The endometrium was poorly differentiated and difficult to see. To date, examination of the uterus using ultrasonography has provided little information about endometrial changes during the ovarian cycle in this group of dolphins. Real-time diagnostic ultrasonography provides a means to image the morphology of the reproductive organs in live female dolphins directly and provides a valuable means of assessing reproductive events in this species.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  A young female bottlenose dolphin (<i>Tursiops aduncas</i>) exhibited signs of lethargy and inappettance for 48 hr. Routine blood chemistry and physical evaluation were negative. Diagnostic ultrasonography was performed. The only finding was a viable pregnancy in the left uterine horn. The dolphin quickly regained normal health and behavior. Two weeks after the original examination, a detailed sonographic assessment of fetal morphology was performed. The fetal skull base appeared disproportionately small, and the cranium could not be identified; a severe neural tube defect was suspected. At term, an uncomplicated, spontaneous delivery produced a stillborn male anencephalic calf. This is the first report of anencephaly in a dolphin fetus and of the prenatal sonographic appearance of this fetal abnormality.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  This project was aimed to collect data about the ovarian cycle of the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin, <i>Sousa chinensis</i>, using sonographic examination of the ovaries and serum hormone level assessment. The ovaries of two nonpregnant females were assessed at least once weekly, and one pregnant female was assessed when possible. A total of 15 normal ovarian cycles, one episode of follicular atresia, and one episode of a luteinized cystic follicle were detected using ultrasonography and serum progesterone levels. Two more cycles were detected on serum progesterone levels but not on ultrasonography. The mean ovarian cycle, mean follicular phase, mean follicle diameter measured just before ovulation, mean luteal phase, and average diameter of the corpus luteum were determined. Data showed an irregular pattern of ovarian cycling, varying between and within subjects. Serum progesterone and estradiol levels were measured one to three times per month in two females and intermittently in one other female. Recorded progesterone and estradiol levels during the follicular phase, luteal phase, and anestrus are reported. Progesterone levels during pregnancy are also included.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  Ultrasonographic monitoring of folliculogenesis and prediction of ovulation was used for ten years to control breeding in a group of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (<i>Tursiops aduncus</i>) at Ocean Park, Hong Kong, where male and female dolphins were housed separately from 1991. When folliculogenesis was identified in a selected female, the cycle was monitored until ovulation was predicted within the next 12 to 24 h; a male was selected and then placed with the female overnight.Ultrasonography was repeated the next morning to determine ovulation. If ovulation had occurred, the animals were separated; if not, the pair remained together until ovulation was confirmed. Ultrasonography was subsequently used to monitor the development of the corpus luteum and to identify pregnancy. This procedure was conducted 11 times between 1993 and 2003.In nine cases, ovulation was predicted accurately and occurred within 24 hours. In two cases, ovulation occurred within two to four days of the predicted date. In ten cases, pregnancy ensued. To date, nine calves have been born live after gestation lengths of 349-382 days.<br>

Whales were allocated a behavioral category prior to biopsy sampling according to the general behavior of their pod. Behavioral reactions were recorded after each attempt. Sex was determined using a molecular genetic technique. Detectable reactions occurred in 41.6% of successful biopsy attempts, a significantly lower response rate than that reported by two studies carried out on the feeding and breeding grounds of the North Atlantic. There was no difference in the response rate of whales on their northward or southward migration. Pod size was not an important factor in predicting the response of an individual. Females responded to biopsy sampling at a significantly higher rate than males. Our results indicate that a substantial difference in response rate can occur between studies. Factors such as the type of boat used and the prior exposure of whales to human impact may be of importance. Our study suggests that female humpback whales may be particularly responsive to human disturbances. Overall, however, biopsy sampling has minimal impact on humpback whales.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  The carcass of a young adult male Indian Ocean Bottlenose dolphin (<i>Tursiops cf aduncus</i>) was found floating in an estuary near Adelaide, South Australia. An autopsy revealed that death had been caused by obstruction of the upper aerodigestive tract by a 660 mm Cobbler Carpetshark (<i>Sutorectus tentaculatus</i>). Similar airway obstruction in humans while feeding has been termed cafe coronary syndrome. Although death may have merely resulted from over-enthusiastic feeding, the possibility of neurological impairment was considered, and limited toxicological analyses of tissues was undertaken. No increase in organochlorine pesticides was found, however the possibility of heavy metal poisoning was not excluded. Formal neuropathology was unable to be undertaken. When sudden death in other mammal species mimics cases that are found in humans, similar underlying mechanisms may be present.<br>

ISSN: 0027-3910.<br>
<b>Abstract:</b>  The sourthern white whale <i>Eubalaena australis</i> (Desmoulins 1922) was drastically diminished through massive captures since the 18th century. This species was put under international protection in 1936 and since then, it is only occasionally seen in the Chilean coast. The arrival of a female and a newborn at Los Reumbes beach (37 deg 12'S - 73 deg 35W) Golfo de Arauco, Chile, may point to the beginning of a settlement of its former domains. The permanency of two specimens allowed the recollection of information on behaviour and photographic identification. The process of upbringing was not completed due to human intervention that lead the calf to be stranded at the beach. This note evaluates the responsability of human action, and gives through necropsy information about morphometric and reproductive aspects.<br>

Amyloid deposition was mainly and most prominently in the corticomedullary regions of the kidneys and less consistently in the vessels of the spleen, lung, and heart and around acini of the palatal salivary gland and the thyroid gland. Pretreatment of sections with permanganate and sulfuric acid greatly diminished Congo red staining, suggesting the dolphin amyloid is of the AA variety.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  In a 3-year (1988-1990) pathological study, 24 carcasses of beluga whales from the St Lawrence Estuary, Quebec, Canada, showed numerous severe lesions, many of which had never been reported in cetaceans. The most common lesions were found in the digestive tract (21 animals) and consisted mainly of periodontitis and of erosions and ulcers in the oesophagus and the first two gastric compartments. Pneumonia, usually of parasitic origin, was also a common finding (12 animals). The adrenal glands often contained nodules (five animals) or cysts (seven animals), and mastitis was observed in five females. Overall, the incidence of degenerative, infectious, hyperplastic or necrotic lesions, in addition to numerous neoplasms described in another paper, was considerably higher than that found in marine mammals elsewhere or in other species of marine mammal from the same waters.<br>

The lesion, slightly visible from the macroscopic point of view, had the histologic appearance of a &quot;foreign tissue island,&quot; which was poorly demarcated from the surrounding pulmonary tissue. Within Such an island, several regularly shaped and apparently mature kidney glomeruli and tubules could be observed, with no evidence of secondary tissue reaction. To the best of our knowledge, this should be the first description of heterotopic kidney tissue Occurrence in the lung of any domestic or wild animal species.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  The morphological characteristics, estimated age, gender, reproductive status, stomach contents and cause of death were determined for 10 Hector.s dolphins (<i>Cephalorhynchus hectori</i>), one dusky dolphin (<i>Lagenorhynchus obscurus</i>) and one common dolphin (<i>Delphinus delphis</i>). The dusky and common dolphins were killed incidentally in commercial fishing operations. The 10 Hector.s dolphins were retrieved from set nets (3), floating at sea off the west coast of the North Island (1), beachcast on the west coast of the South Island (5), or east coast of the South Island (1). The stomachs of four Hector's dolphins were empty. The stomachs of all remaining dolphins contained the remains of teleost fish. Fish predominated in the stomachs of Hector's dolphins, but fish and squid were equally represented in the stomachs of the dusky and common dolphins. Age was estimated for all dolphins by counting dentinal growth layer groups in stained sections of teeth. Two female dolphins were sexed using molecular genetic analysis because their gonads had been scavenged. Four female Hector's dolphins were sexually immature, one was mature-anoestrus. They ranged from &lt; 1 year old (neonatal) to approximately 7.5 years old. Four male Hector's dolphins had mature gonads and were between 5 and 7.5 years old. One other, estimated to be 3.5 years old, had histologically immature gonads. The male dusky and common dolphins were sexually mature, and were estimated to be 8.5 and 11 years old, respectively. All the Hector's, dusky, and common dolphins known to have been entangled in nets, had lesions consistent with death from entanglement and asphyxiation. One of the seven remaining beachcast Hector's dolphins had lesions indicative of entanglement, two had lesions consistent with trauma, asphyxiation and sudden death, two were too decomposed to determine cause of death, and two were neonates, their deaths possibly the result of separation from their mothers.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  Morphological characteristics, estimated age, gender, reproductive status, stomach contents and cause of death have been determined for 11 Hector's dolphins (<i>Cephalorhynchus hectori hectori)</i>, one Mau's dolphin (<i>Cephalorhynchus hectori maui</i>), four common dolphins (<i>Delphinus delphis</i>), and one bottlenose dolphin (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>). The common dolphins and one Hector's dolphin were killed incidentally in commercial fishing operations. The remaining Hector's dolphins and the Maui's dolphin were retrieved either from set-nets (n = 1), or found beachcast along the west coast of the North Island (n = 1), west coast of the South Island (n = 7), or east coast of the South Island (n = 2). The beachcast carcasses ranged from freshly dead to skeletal remains. The stomachs of five Hector's dolphins had detectable remains consisting of fish, otoliths, and fish bones. Fish and squid were equally represented in the stomachs of the common dolphins. Age was estimated by counting dentinal growth layer groups in stained sections of teeth. Two female Hector's dolphins were too decomposed to determine reproductive status but the remaining two were immature. Of five male Hector's dolphins, one was pubertal, three immature, and one was too decomposed for examination of gonads. The male Maui's dolphin and the bottlenose dolphin were also immature. Of the four common dolphins, two Hector's dolphins, and the bottlenose dolphin known to have been net-entangled, all had lesions consistent with death from asphyxiation. Two of the nine beachcast Hector's dolphins had lesions indicative of entanglement, two did not appear to have been entangled and parasitic pneumonia may have had a role in their death, one died from acute blunt trauma of unknown origin, and four were too decomposed to determine cause of death. The Maui's dolphin died from complications associated with <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> infection of the lungs.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  The MRI examination was carried out in a formalin-fixed specimen of the Ganges River dolphin (<i>Platanista gangetica</i>), one of the evolutionary primitive species of cetaceans.We could morphologically elucidate the tracheobronchial ramification in the intact whole body.We demonstrated from the MRI sections that the characteristic tracheal bronchus branches from the trachea at the cranial portion.These findings suggest the phylogenetic relationships between cetaceans and artiodactyls.The left bronchus is obviously larger in diameter than the right one.We suggest that the right bronchus has smaller capacity of gas exchange than the left one, because the dolphin possesses the tracheal bronchus in the right lung.The MRI method will be important in the non-invasive study of the anatomy in endangered animal carcass as Ganges River dolphin.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  Various studies on Mediterranean cetaceans have revealed bioaccumulation of contaminants such as organochlorines (OCs) and heavy metals. The susceptibility of these animals to organic pollutants and the relationship between bioaccumulation and population decline (as in the case of <i>Delphinus delphis</i>) are unexplored fields. In this study, we used a non-destructive approach (skin biopsy) to explore OC bioaccumulation processes and mixed-function oxidase activity (BPMO) in four species of cetaceans: striped dolphin (<i>Stenella coeruleoalba</i>), bottlenose dolphin (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>), common dolphin (<i>D. delphis</i>) and fin whale (<i>Balaenoptera physalus</i>). Significant differences in BPMO induction and OC levels were found between odontocetes and mysticetes, the former having mixed-function oxidase activities four times higher than the latter, binding with levels of OCs one order of magnitude higher in odontocetes. A significant correlation (P &lt; 0.05) between BPMO activities and OC levels was found in B. physalus. In an ongoing project, fibroblast cultures have been used as an alternative in vitro method of evaluating interspecies susceptibility to contaminants such as OCs and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). These results suggest that cetacean skin biopsies are a powerful non-invasive tool for assessing ecotoxicological risk to Mediterranean marine mammals species.<br>

ISSN: 0141-1136.<br>
<b>Abstract:</b>  Various studies have revealed high concentrations of contaminants such as organochlorines (OCs) and heavy metals in Mediterranean cetaceans. A geographical trend of contamination (PCBs and DDTs) has been found for striped dolphin (<i>Stenella coeruleoalba</i>). In this study we used a non-lethal approach (skin biopsy) to investigate bioaccumulation of OCs, including polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs), DDTs, polychlorodibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorodibenzofurans (PCDFs), trace elements (Hg, Cd, Pb) and CYP1A activity (BPMO) in nine striped dolphins sampled in the Aeolian area (Sicily &#251; Italy) in summer 2002. The arithmetic mean value of BPMO activity in this group was 43.46 AUF/g tissue/h. This value is approximately 3 times and 5 times lower, respectively, than the value found in the Ionian and in the Ligurian groups. Skin biopsies of striped dolphins emerged as a suitable material for assessing the toxicological status of the various Mediterranean groups.<br>

A pronounced bradycardia was noted in diving animals which reflects the level of their adaptation to hypoxia and hypoxemia. Autocorrelation functions of the dynamic sequences of cardiointervals were calculated. The presence of &quot;slow&quot; waves in cardiac cycle was shown which were considerably increased during diving.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  Top predators from the northern sub-polar and polar areas exhibit high cadmium concentrations in their tissues. In the aim to reveal possible adverse effects, samples of five Atlantic white-sided dolphins <i>Lagenorhyncus acutus</i> have been collected on the occasion of the drive fishery in the Faroe Islands, for ultrastructural investigations and energy dispersive X-ray microanalyses. Cadmium concentrations were less than the limit of detection in both immature individuals and ranged from 22.7 to 31.1 microg x g(-1) wet weight in the mature individuals. Two individuals with the highest cadmium concentrations exhibited electron dense mineral concretions in the basal membranes of the proximal tubules. They are spherocrystals made up of numerous strata mineral deposit of calcium and phosphorus together with cadmium. Cadmium has been detected with a molar ratio of Ca:Cd of 10:1 in the middle of these concretions. To our knowledge, this is the first report of such granules in a wild vertebrate. The role of these granules in the detoxification of the metal and the possible pathological effects are considered.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  A 4-6-week-old male bottlenose dolphin (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>) was found freshly dead on a beach. He belonged to a nearby dolphin group that was known to have considerable curiosity about human activity and to frequently approach pleasure craft. An autopsy revealed an otherwise healthy animal with death due to a stab wound that had passed completely through the body, incising the aorta. Careful assessment of the wounds indicated that the blade of the weapon had been at least 190 mm in length and 22 mm in width, with a single edge. This report demonstrates that standard forensic techniques may be extremely useful in determining the cause of death in animals, in documenting injuries to assist in the investigation of such cases, and in providing facts to aid in the successful prosecution of those guilty of killing or injuring animals.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  Massive urolithiasis of the penile urethra was observed in an adult pygmy sperm whale (<i>Kogia breviceps</i>) stranded on Topsail Island, North Carolina, USA. Calculi occupied the urethra from just distal to the sigmoid flexure to the tip of the penis for a length of 43 cm. A urethral diverticulum was present proximal to the calculi. The major portion of the multinodular urolith weighed 208 g and was 16 cm long x 3.7 cm diameter at the widest point. The urolith was composed of 100% struvite (magnesium ammonium phosphate) and on culture yielded <i>Klebsiella, oxytoca</i>, a urease-positive Bacterium occasionally associated with struvite urolith formation in domestic animals. Reaction to the calculi was characterized histologically by moderate multifocal to coalescing plasmacytic balanitis and penile urethritis. Role of the urethrolithiasis in the whale's stranding is speculative but could have involved pain or metabolic perturbations such as uremia or hyperammonemia.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  <i>Helicobacter cetorum</i> sp. nov. has been cultured from the stomach of Atlantic white-sided dolphins (<i>Lagenorhynchus acutus</i>) and the feces of Pacific white-sided (<i>L. obliquidens</i>) and Atlantic bottlenose (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>) dolphins and a beluga whale (<i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>). H. cetorum has high homology to <i>Helicobacter pylori </i>as shown by 16S rRNA sequencing, and H. cetorum infection has been associated with gastritis and clinical signs in cetaceans. Because the prevalence of <i>H. cetorum</i> in wild populations is unknown, minimally invasive techniques for detecting <i>H. cetorum</i> were compared for 20 wild bottlenose dolphins sampled as part of a long-term health study. Fecal samples were tested for helicobacter by culture, Southern blotting, and PCR using genus-specific and <i>H. cetorum</i>-specific primers. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed to measure <i>H. cetorum</i> immunoglobulin G (IgG). H. cetorum was cultured from 4 of 20 fecal samples, 7 samples were positive using Helicobacter sp. PCR, and 8 samples were positive for H. cetorum using species-specific primers. Two additional fecal samples were positive by Helicobacter sp. Southern blotting, suggesting infection with another helicobacter. All 20 sera contained high levels of IgG antibodies to <i>H. cetorum</i> that were significantly lowered by preabsorption of the sera with whole-cell suspensions of H. cetorum (P &lt; 0.02). Until the specificity of the serum ELISA can be determined by testing sera from dolphins confirmed to be uninfected, PCR and Southern blot screenings of feces are the most sensitive techniques for detection of <i>H. cetorum</i>, and results indicate there is at least a 50% prevalence of <i>H. cetorum</i> infection in these dolphins.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  Gastric ulcerations in dolphins have been reported for decades. Some of these lesions were associated with parasitic infections. However, cases of nonparasitic gastric ulcers with no clearly defined etiology also have been reported in wild and captive dolphins. Considerable speculation exists as to whether dolphins have Helicobacter-associated gastritis and peptic ulcer disease. The stomachs of seven stranded Atlantic white-sided dolphins, <i>Lagenorhynchus acutus</i>, and 1 common dolphin, <i>Delphinus delphis</i>, were assessed for the presence of Helicobacter species. Novel Helicobacter species were identified by culture in the gastric mucosa of two of the eight dolphins studied and by PCR in seven of the eight dolphins. The gram-negative organisms were urease, catalase, and oxidase positive. Spiral to fusiform bacteria were detected in gastric mucosa by Warthin Starry staining. Histopathology revealed mild to moderate diffuse lymphoplasmacytic gastritis within the superficial mucosa of the main stomach. The pyloric stomach was less inflamed, and bacteria did not extend deep into the glands. The lesions parallel those observed in <i>Helicobacter pylori</i>-infected humans. Bacteria from two dolphins classified by 16S rRNA analysis clustered with gastric helicobacters and represent a novel Helicobacter sp. most closely related to <i>H. pylori</i>. These findings suggest that a novel Helicobacter sp. may play a role in the etiopathogenesis of gastritis and gastric ulcers in dolphins. To our knowledge this represents the first isolation and characterization of a novel Helicobacter sp. from a marine mammal and emphasizes the wide host distribution and pathogenic potential of this increasingly important genus.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  The iridocorneal angles of prepared eyes from the West Indian manatee, short-finned pilot whale, hippopotamus and African elephant were examined and compared using light microscopy. The manatee and pilot whale demonstrated capacity for a large amount of aqueous outflow, probably as part of a system compensating for lack of ciliary musculature, and possibly also related to environmental changes associated with life at varying depths. The elephant angle displayed many characteristics of large herbivores, but was found to have relatively low capacity for aqueous outflow via both primary and secondary routes. The hippopotamus shared characteristics with both land- and water-dwelling mammals; uveoscleral aqueous outflow may be substantial as in the marine mammals, but the angular aqueous plexus was less extensive and a robust pectinate ligament was present. The angles varied greatly in size and composition among the four species, and most structures were found to be uniquely suited to the habitat of each animal.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  <i>Lacazia loboi</i> (syn. <i>Loboa loboi</i>), the etiological agent of lobomycosis, was compared in human and dolphin tissue using light and electron microscopy, and computer-assisted morphometrics. The histological features of the lesions were similar; however, preliminary electron microscopy data indicates that cell wall destruction may vary in the two hosts. Calcofluor stained tissue sections of human and dolphin tissue were examined with UV light microscopy and the images digitized. Measurements of area, minimum and maximum diameters, and perimeter were made. Student's t-test (alpha = 0.01) revealed that L. loboi cells infecting dolphin tissue were significantly smaller than those infecting human tissue. This study represents the first comparative analysis of the morphology of the etiological agent of this disease in its two known natural hosts. The data indicate that the organism may not be identical in the two hosts.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  An adult female bowhead whale, <i>Balaena mysticetus</i>, from the Beaufort Sea, Alaska (USA), had necrosis of a well-demarcated portion of the mid-jejunum and adjacent mesentery, accompanied by fibrinous peritonitis. The veins within the mesentery adjacent to the affected intestine were severely dilated and hyperemic. There were no perforations of the gastrointestinal tract, nor any thromboses within the mesenteric veins. Death appeared due to the sequelae of intestinal volvulus and infarction; reduction of the displacement presumably occurred during handling of the animal.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  Samples of common skin abnormalities from 23 subsistence-harvested bowhead whales (<i>Balaena mysticetus</i>) were examined. Most lesions fell into three broad classes: shallow lacerations, circular depressions, and epidermal sloughing. Both circular depression lesions and epidermal sloughing lesions may be divided into more than one subgroup based on morphological criteria. Examination of each of the subgroups using light and scanning electron microscopy suggests relationships among the subgroups of a class. These proposed relationships are discussed, as are some possible etiologies. Scanning electron microscopy reveals abundant bacteria and diatoms present in association with each lesion class but no evidence of a particular association characteristic of a lesion class. The microflora were especially abundant wherever the stratum spinosum was exposed at the skin surface.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is commonly used in the assessment of the musculoskeletal system and associated pathology. The ability of MRI to measure the signals from water and lipid protons enables quantitative measurements of bone porosity. The goal of this investigation was to demonstrate that the density and cross-sectional geometry of whole bones can be noninvasively measured using MRI. Ten trabecular specimens cored from whale vertebrae were used to compare apparent bone density measured directly, and using a quantitative MRI algorithm. Bone density and several cross-sectional geometric properties were also measured using MRI in the distal tibia of 14 volunteers. The MRI measurements were compared with measurements made using quantitative-computed tomography (QCT). A proton density sequence was used for all MRI studies. A porosity phantom was included in the MRI examinations and used to convert the MRI signal intensity to bone volume fraction. Bone density and cross-sectional bone geometry were calculated from the bone volume fractions by assuming constant tissue properties. The apparent density of trabecular bone cores measured directly and using quantitative MRI were linearly related (r(2) = 0.959; P &lt; 0. 01). A strong linear relation also existed between MRI and QCT measurements of ash density (r(2) = 0.923; P &lt; 0.01) and cross-sectional geometric properties (r(2) = 0.976-0.992; P &lt; 0.01). MRI data can be used to measure bone density and cross-sectional geometry of whole bones if a proton density sequence is used to homogenize differences in marrow composition and a porosity phantom is used for slice-specific volume fraction calibration.<br>

ISSN: 1560-2206.<br>
<b>Abstract:</b>  Determination of elapsed time since death in small cetaceans can be important to our understanding of the nature of their interactions with fishing operations. This pilot study was conducted to determine the potential diagnostic usefulness of ocular fluid (vitreous humour) and core body temperature to estimate postmortem intervals in harbour porpoises (<i>Phocoena phocoena</i>). Core temperature and concentrations of various constituents of vitreous humour (glucose, urea, sodium, potassium, chloride, magnesium, calcium, and phosphorus) were determined in 24 harbour porpoises incidentally caught in groundfish gillnets in the waters of the Gulf of Maine and the Bay of Fundy. These parameters were compared to published values for rectal temperatures and the serum concentrations of several selected elements in live harbour porpoises. Glucose in vitreous humour decreased in dead animals compared to serum values in live ones; its level was positively correlated with core temperature. Potassium and magnesium in vitreous humour increased following death. These data suggest that most animals analysed had been dead for several hours. For the present, the methodology affords researchers an approach that appears to hold some promise. However, the most practical technique requires testing animals with a known time of death in order to derive a set of curves for ocular fluid values and temperature versus time that are appropriate for a statistical presentation of predictability for the time since death.<br>

ISSN: 1342-6133.<br>
<b>Abstract:</b>  The Japanese Whale Research Program under Special Permit in the Antarctic (JARPA) has been conducted since the 1987/88 season and has taken an annual maximum of 440 Antarctic minke whales <i>Balaenoptera bonaerensis</i>. In order to improve whale-killing methods, we have analyzed 3,246 catch and necropsy records of Antarctic minke whales taken between the 1993/94 - 2000/2001 seasons. The average time-to-death (TTD) for each body-length class increased with body length, while the instantaneous death rate (IDR) showed no relation to body length except for whales less than 6 m. The relationship between the severity of harpoon wounds and IDR/TTD was examined. The highest 1DR was observed for wounds to the brain and cervical vertebra (Central Nervous System; CNS). Wounds to the forepart of the thoracic vertebra and heart showed the next highest IDR. On the other hand, destruction of abdominal viscera as well as lumbar and caudal vertebra showed a low IDR and were less effective in reducing TTD. The average firing angle was 36.7[degree] and there was no significant difference in that angle between whales that died instantly and those that did not. Considering the chasing methods in the JARPA, the most efficient internal harpoon tracks (target organs) were, thorax - skull (heart and CNS), penetration of thorax (heart) as well as abdomen - thorax (heart). TTD and IDR in the JARPA have been steadily improved. The next step calls for further improvements in whaling devices.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  Of 14 common dolphins, 12 showed non-specific reactive hepatitis and three chronic parasitic cholangitis with lymphoid proliferation. Non-specific reactive hepatitis was shown immunohistochemically to be associated with small clusters of CD3(+) cells in portal areas and hepatic sinusoids. Polyclonal antibody against S100 protein reacted with a variable number of lymphocytes from portal areas and hepatic sinusoids, as well as with Kupffer cells and epithelial cells of the bile ducts. The majority of plasma cells observed in portal areas and hepatic sinusoids were IgG(+). In lymphonodular lesions of chronic parasitic cholangitis, the distribution of immunoreactive cells was similar to that found in the cortex of lymph nodes. The presence of stellate cells similar to follicular dendritic and interdigitating cells expressing S-100 protein and MHC class II antigen in lymphonodular lesions suggested that these were highly organized structures developed to enhance antigen presentation to B and T cells.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  On November 18, 1994, four sperm whales were discovered dead on the Belgian coast, and on January 12, 1995 three live sperm whales stranded on the Dutch coast. Necropsies were conducted following a standardized procedure and samples were collected. Two Belgian sperm whales had a severe weight deficit and the Dutch sperm whales had reductions in blubber thickness. Agonal lesions such as visceral passive congestion and lung edema were due to the stranding. Significant lesions included acute ulcerations of the skin and acute to subacute ulcerative stomatitis. Severe diffuse subacute to chronic ulcerative external otitis was noted in four animals. Progressive weakness and/or potential alterations of echolocation might have predisposed these sperm whales to visit shallow waters - strong social cohesion and complex coastal topography along the Dutch and Belgian coasts being the final factors leading to the stranding.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  Morbillivirus infections were described since 1988 in marine mammals including pinnipeds and cetaceans. Since, numerous outbreaks, responsible for thousands marine mammals death, as well as sporadic cases, have occurred in various populations from North Atlantic, Mediterranean Sea, Baikal Lake, Caspian Sea, and recently from northern Pacific. Clinical signs and macroscopic lesions are similar between species infected by morbillivirus and are close to those reported in dog with canine distemper. Under microscope, characteristic lesions are interstitial bronchopneumonia, lymphoid depletion and subacute encephalitis. Syncytia and inclusion bodies are frequently observed in lesions and epithelia. Lymphoid depletion promotes secondary infections by opportunistic pathogens, responsible in many cases of the animals death. Various parameters explain the high sensibility of certain population such as the species, the naive immunological status and vectors intervention for the disease.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  The pathological changes observed in the lungs of 197 freshly dead to moderately decomposed harbour porpoises (<i>Phocoenaphocoena</i>) stranded in England and Wales between October 1990 and December 1996 were reviewed. In 135 (69 per cent of the cases) macroscopic nematode infections of the bronchial tract with <i>Pseudalius inflexus</i> and <i>Torynurus convolutus</i>, either singly or in combination, were recorded, and 106 (54 per cent) also had P inflexus within the pulmonary blood vessels. All the macroscopically parasitised porpoises were adults or juveniles although two neonates had histological evidence of nematode infection. There were 62 cases of mild to severe, subacute to chronic bronchitis and bronchiolitis, 113 cases of mild to severe chronic granulomatous interstitial pneumonia, and 34 cases of mild to severe vasculitis or thrombovasculitis of pulmonary blood vessels attributable to these nematode infections. In 35 cases necropurulent or purulent (broncho)pneumonias were attributed either to secondary bacterial infections of the lungs or to septicaemias associated in seven cases with Streptococcus canis, in two cases with group B Salmonella species, in one case with <i>Escherichia coli</i> and in one case with <i>Streptococcus lactis</i>. The pulmonary lesions in 67 animals known or diagnosed to have been entrapped in fishing gear were non-specific and included persistent foam in the airways in 45 cases, diffuse congestion in 53, oedema in 50, and multifocal intra-alveolar haemorrhage in 33 cases. Seven cases of acute fibrinous or chronic fibrous pleuritis, seven cases of chronic necropurulent pneumonia associated with mycotic infections, four porpoises with traumatic lesions of the thorax and other parts of the body consistent with fatal attack from bottlenose dolphins (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>), and one case of diffuse bronchointerstitial pneumonia associated with generalised morbillivirus infection were also recorded.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  The first evidence suggestive of in vivo gas bubble formation in cetacea, including eight animals stranded in the UK, has recently been reported. This article presents the pathologic findings from these eight UK-stranded cetaceans and two additional UK-stranded cetacean cases in detail. Hepatic gas-filled cavitary lesions (0.2-6.0 cm diameter) involving approximately 5-90% of the liver volume were found in four (two juvenile, two adult) Risso's dolphins (<i>Grampus griseus</i>), three (two adult, one juvenile) common dolphins (<i>Delphinus delphis</i>), an adult Blainville's beaked whale (<i>Mesoplodon densirostris</i>), and an adult harbour porpoise (<i>Phocoena phocoena</i>). Histopathologic examination of the seven dolphin cases with gross liver cavities revealed variable degrees of pericavitary fibrosis, microscopic, intrahepatic, spherical, nonstaining cavities (typically 50-750 microm in diameter) consistent with gas emboli within distended portal vessels and sinusoids and associated with hepatic tissue compression, hemorrhages, fibrin/organizing thrombi, and foci of acute hepato-cellular necrosis. Two common dolphins also had multiple and bilateral gross renal cavities (2.0-9.0 mm diameter) that, microscopically, were consistent with acute (n = 2) and chronic (n = 1) arterial gas emboli-induced renal infarcts. Microscopic, bubblelike cavities were also found in mesenteric lymph node (n = 4), adrenal (n = 2), spleen (n = 2), pulmonary associated lymph node (n = 1), posterior cervical lymph node (n = 1), and thyroid (n = 1). No bacterial organisms were isolated from five of six cavitated livers and one of one cavitated kidneys. The etiology and pathogenesis of these lesions are not known, although a decompression-related mechanism involving embolism of intestinal gas or de novo gas bubble (emboli) development derived from tissues supersaturated with nitrogen is suspected.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  Details of morphology and distribution of hepatic macrophages in cetaceans were investigated using the immunohistochemistry with an antibody (SRA-E5) generated against human macrophage scavenger receptor antigen. Liver samples were obtained from five species of cetaceans (Baird's beaked whales, short-finned pilot whales, Risso's dolphins, bottlenose dolphins, and pantropical spotted dolphins). Except for two species of whales, the number of SRA-E5-positive Kupffer cells was greatest in the perivenous zone (zone 3), followed by the mid-zonal (zone 2) and periportal (zone 1) zones; this distribution pattern was different from that in cattle examined here and previously reported rodents with the highest number in zone 1. The frequency of Kupffer cell in each of zones was significantly different among species, and interestingly, the total mean of the Kupffer cell number in three zones increased as the body-length of species was small. In cetaceans, Kupffer cells in zone 1 appeared larger and more stellate in shape, whereas those in zone 3 were smaller and rounder. All cetaceans but Baird's beaked whales had the black pigment-containing Kupffer cells, with the greatest number in zone 3, and macrophages with the similar pigments were also seen in the hepatic intermediate septa, indicating an active phagocytosis. Most of the black pigments were considered to be lipofuscin and such pigments were not seen in the bovine livers. These results indicate that cetacean hepatic macrophages show differences in the distribution and phagocytosis among hepatic lobular zones, or between cetacean species and terrestrial animals.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  This review addresses the diagnosis of insensibility and death in various species so as to evaluate the validity of the current criteria used to judge death in hunted whales by the International Whaling Commission (IWC). The only other species in which official criteria of death have been formulated is humans and these are controversial with the kernel of the debate being the definition of brain death. In slaughter animals, the moment of insensibility is regarded as the most important criterion and the issue has received scientific interest related to the pre-slaughter stunning. During hunting of terrestrial wildlife, the moment of death is usually regarded as the moment the animal falls and does not move. Based on the data presented in the present paper, it is concluded that when death in whales is solely determined on the basis of the IWC criteria, which in practice are based on immobility, a significant proportion of animals will be recorded as being sensible and alive when they are actually unconscious and the time to death (TTD) will be overestimated. If the criteria are used in conjunction with a postmortem examination, the recorded TTD will be closer to the real TTD and can be used for comparison of methods and performance.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  A new method of in situ formalin fixation was used on 38 brains from minke whales (<i>Balaenoptera acutorostrata</i>). The method was developed because traditional ways of fixing brains are poorly suited to the collection of whale brains. The whole brain was preserved uncut in its meninges and then excised undamaged from the skull at a later opportunity. There was no handling of the brain in the fresh state. Fixation was started within a couple of hours post mortem. All brains were subjected to gross and light microscopy examination. The results showed that both the gross and microscopic architecture of the brains were adequately preserved, with no massive gross or histological changes due to insufficient fixation apparent. The occurrence of fixation artifacts was low. Microscopic examination showed well-preserved cells and myelin in all parts of the brain. We report the mean fixed weight of the minke whale brain as 2741 g, which is the lowest among the baleen whales. The cerebellum constituted 22% of the total brain weight, which conforms to findings in other baleen whales. This in situ method can probably be used without any particular modifications in other whale species and also in large terrestrial mammals.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  A majority of investigations on primary blast injuries have focused on gas-containing organs, while the likelihood of blast-induced neurotrauma remains underrated. In Norway minke whales (<i>Balaenoptera acutorostrata</i>) are hunted using small fishing boats rigged with harpoon guns, which fire harpoons tipped with a grenade containing a charge of 30-g penthrite. The grenade detonates 60-70 cm inside the animal. The present study was undertaken to characterize the neuropathological changes caused by the penthrite blast and evaluate its role in the loss of consciousness and death in hunted whales. The study included 37 minke whales that were examined shipboard. The brains were later subjected to gross and light microscopy examination. The results showed that intra-body detonation of the grenade in near vicinity of the brain resulted in trauma similar to severe traumatic brain injury associated with a direct blow to the head. Detonation in more distant areas of the body resulted in injuries resembling acceleration-induced diffuse traumatic brain injury. The authors conclude that even if several vital organs were fatally injured in most whales, the neurotrauma induced by the blast-generated pressure waves were the primary cause for the immediate or very rapid loss of consciousness and death.<br>

ISSN: 1561-0713.<br>
<b>Abstract:</b>  The biopsy - via dart. trocar or surgery - is becoming the preferred protocol for sampling skin and blubber of many cetacean species, because a small sample from a healthy animal may provide better information than a larger sample collected via necropsy from an ill or emaciated animal. Furthermore, the biopsy is often the only means of obtaining samples (e.g. for threatened or endangered species). Because biopsy darts collect only a small sample of tissue - and blubber can be heterogeneous in structure and composition - it is essential to compare the results obtained from biopsies to those found by analysing full-thickness blubber samples obtained via necropsy. This manuscript compares blubber stratification in two odontocete species, white whales (<i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>) and killer whales (<i>Orcinus orca</i>). Five parameters (i.e. lipid percent and classes, contaminant concentrations and profiles, fatty acid profiles) were measured by blubber depth. Results of these comparisons strongly suggest that biopsy results must be interpreted with caution and in conjunction with results from species-specific blubber depth profiling. For example, lipid classes measured in biopsy samples of white whales and killer whales were similar to those for equivalent-depth samples obtained by necropsy. In addition, lipid-adjusted contaminant concentrations measured in dart or trocar samples adequately represented those obtained by necropsy of both species. Conversely, the lipid content in biopsy samples was lower than that found in same-depth necropsied samples due to loss of lipid during sampling. Also, because of the high level of fatty acid stratification observed, fatty acid profiles from the outer blubber layer collected via biopsy from both species are less likely than the metabolically active inner layer to be useful in determining the prey species consumed by these odontocetes. This study demonstrates, for white and killer whales, that property interpreted results from blubber biopsies can provide valuable information about the body condition, health and life history of individual animals.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  Amikacin, an aminoglycoside antimicrobial, was administered to a killer whale (<i>Orcinus orca</i>) and a beluga whale (<i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>) for the treatment of clinical signs consistent with gram-negative aerobic bacterial infections. Dosage regimens were designed to target a maximal plasma concentration 8-10 times the minimum inhibitory concentrations of the pathogen and to reduce the risk of aminoglycoside toxicity. Allometric analysis of published pharmacokinetic parameters in mature animals yielded a relationship for amikacin's volume of distribution, in milliliters, given by the equation Vd = 151.058(BW)1.043. An initial dose for amikacin was estimated by calculating the volume of distribution and targeted maximal concentration. With this information, dosage regimens for i.m. administration were designed for a killer whale and a beluga whale. Therapeutic drug monitoring was performed on each whale to assess the individual pharmacokinetic parameters. The elimination half-life (5.99 hr), volume of distribution per bioavailability (319 ml/kg). and clearance per bioavailability (0.61 ml/min/kg) were calculated for the killer whale. The elimination half-life (5.03 hr), volume of distribution per bioavailability (229 ml/kg). and clearance per bioavailability (0.53 ml/min/kg) were calculated for the beluga whale. The volume of distribution predicted from the allometric equation for both whales was similar to the calculated pharmacokinetic parameter. Both whales exhibited a prolonged elimination half-life and decreased clearance when compared with other animal species despite normal renal parameters on biochemistry panels. Allometric principles and therapeutic drug monitoring were used to accurately determine the doses in these cases and to avoid toxicity.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  Ultrasonographic measurements were made at least once a month during 14 gestations in seven <i>Tursiops truncatus</i> and 12 gestations in five <i>Tursiops aduncus</i> (bottlenosed dolphins). The 121 measurements of the fetal biparietal diameter and 139 measurements of the fetal thoracic diameter in <i>T truncatus</i> and the 97 measurements of the biparietal diameter and 97 measurements of the thoracic diameter in <i>Taduncus</i> were used to establish regression lines for the increases in the diameter of the head and thorax of the fetus with time. From these relationships an easy-to-use computer program was developed to predict the date of birth of the two species of bottlenosed dolphin, and its predictions were compared with the actual dates of birth of other calves of both species. The births occurred within the range of predicted dates, and even when only a few measurements were available, the program provided accurate predictions.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  Thirty stranded beluga whales (<i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>) from the St. Lawrence Estuary (Quebec, Canada) population and five animals from the Hudson Bay aboriginal hunt (North-west Territories, Canada) were examined. Twenty one animals from the St. Lawrence Estuary had mild to severe adrenal lesions and four whales from the Hudson Bay population were affected by minimal adrenal changes. Cortical hyperplasia was observed in 24 adult beluga whales all from the St. Lawrence Estuary. Bilateral cortical cysts and cellular vacuolar degeneration were observed in the adrenal glands of 19 beluga whales from both populations. The cysts, filled with a cortisol-rich liquid, were present in both sexes. Beluga whales with adrenal cysts were significantly older than animals without cysts, and the severity of the lesions increased with age. Nodular hyperplasia of the medulla was observed in seven of the beluga whales, all from the St. Lawrence Estuary population. All lesions could be part of a normal aging process. The adrenocortical lesions might be due to stress or adrenocorticolytic xenobiotics, while the medullary hyperplasia might be caused by hypoxia or exposure to estrogenic xenobiotics.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  Erythropoietin, a glycoprotein growth hormone that is produced primarily in the kidneys, promotes mitosis and survival of erythroid progenitors. The recent synthesis of the human form of the hormone by recombinant technology has provided a new therapeutic option, which is being used in both human and veterinary medicine for treatment of various anemias. A mature male rough-toothed dolphin, <i>Steno bredanensis</i>, was treated with human recombinant erythropoietin in an attempt to resolve a nonregenerative anemia. Two i.m. injections 48 hr apart were associated with an almost immediate increase in circulating immature reticulocytes, total reticulocytes, and nucleated erythrocytes. Over the next several weeks, the hematocrit, hemoglobin, and erythrocyte counts returned to normal, and the animal was subsequently released back into the wild. Endogenous erythropoietin concentrations were determined for this animal as well as three other conspecifics by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for human erythropoietin. These measurements showed circulating erythropoietin concentrations (5-20+ mU/ml) similar to those of most other mammals. This study suggests that human recombinant erythropoietin can be safely and effectively used in this species and may have applicability to other cetacean species for the treatment of nonregenerative anemia.

<b>Abstract:</b>  The aim of this study was to develop a useful method for obtaining viable tissue samples for establishing cell cultures from skin biopsies of free-ranging cetaceans. The skin biopsies were performed by two methods: dart from an air gun and dart from a crossbow. The dart tip was modified to collect tissue. The tissue was kept in tissue culture medium at ambient temperature, then processed within 24 h. Many modifications in culture technique, with respect to conventional culture methods for human fibroblasts, were made. The cultures thus obtained can be used for many purposes, including genetic and toxicological studies. In toxicology they are an alternative in vitro system for studying threatened animals such as marine mammals. In particular, fibroblasts can be used to test the vulnerability of cetaceans and pinnipeds to different environmental contaminants such as organochlorine compounds, heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  The thermal characteristics of the mystacial vibrissae of harbour seals (<i>Phoca vitulina</i>) and of the follicle crypts on the rostrum of the dolphin <i>Sotalia fluviatilis guianensis</i> were measured using an infrared imaging system. Thermograms demonstrate that, in both species, single vibrissal follicles are clearly defined units of high thermal radiation, indicating a separate blood supply to these cutaneous structures. It is suggested that the high surface temperatures measured in the area of the mouth of the follicles is a function of the sinus system. In seals and dolphins, surface temperature gradually decreased with increasing distance from the centre of a follicle, indicating heat conduction from the sinus system via the follicle capsule to adjacent tissues. It is suggested that the follicular sinus system is a thermoregulatory structure responsible for the maintenance of high tactile sensitivity at the extremely low ambient temperatures demonstrated for the vibrissal system of seals. The vibrissal follicles of odontocetes have been described as vestigial structures, but the thermograms obtained in the present study provide the first evidence that, in <i>Sotalia fluviatilis</i>, the follicles possess a well-developed sinus system, suggesting that they are part of a functional mechanosensory system.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  On 27 January 2000, a struvite calculus was observed in the vagina during necropsy of a 138-cm-long female bottlenose dolphin (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>) collected from the Stono River, South Carolina (USA). Vaginal calculi have been reported in other species of cetaceans but not in bottlenose dolphins. Urinary tract infection might have been an underlying cause of the calculus. While urinary tract inflammation was not detected by light microscopic evaluation of sections of the urinary tract, it is conceivable that sufficient time had lapsed following voiding of the calculus through the urethra for urinary tract infection to have resolved. To further define the prevalence and significance of urolithiasis, prosectors of dead stranded marine mammals are encouraged to closely observe their urinary and genital tracts for calculi and to submit them for quantitative analysis.<br>

Follicular cysts and nodules of adenomatous hyperplasia of the thyroid gland were found in eight and nine adults from the St. Lawrence Estuary (n = 10), respectively, and in four and six adults from Hudson Bay (n = 14), respectively. The total volume of the lesions of thyroid adenomatous hyperplasia was positively correlated with age in both populations. Comparison between populations could not be performed because of differences in age structures of sample groups. Beluga whales from both populations have unique thyroid lesions among marine mammals.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  We describe the first case of cryptococcosis caused by <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i> var. gattii in a male Atlantic bottlenose dolphin (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>). The dolphin showed clinical signs of tachypnea, transient dyspnea, and mild tachycardia and developed multiple hyperechoic nodules, parenchymal consolidation, and thickening of pleura. A diagnosis of bronchopneumonia with pleuritis was made. Itraconazole therapy was implemented for 120 days, and trough levels in serum were within or above the suggested therapeutic range. Titers of cryptococcal antigen in serum increased eightfold during therapy, and the case had a fatal outcome. Necropsy examination findings included enlarged pulmonary lymph nodes and extensive coalescing granulomatous lesions throughout both lungs. Histologic examination revealed numerous, spherical to ellipsoidal, mucicarmine-positive, 3- to 14-microm, encapsulated, budding cells consistent with <i>C. neoformans</i>. Culture of the lung tissue yielded colonies of <i>C. neoformans</i>. The isolate was urease positive and nitrate negative and exhibited phenoloxidase activity. It was positive on canavanine-glycine-bromothymol blue agar. When tested by the Iatron serodiagnostic reagent kit (Iatron Laboratories, Inc.), it was shown to belong to serotype B.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  The morbillivirus epizootic during 1990 to 1992 in Mediterranean striped dolphins (<i>Stenella coeruleoalba</i>) off the Mediterranean coast of Spain diminished these populations directly through mortalities, and indirectly through loss of normal fecundity. High levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's) also were detected in stranded animals. In addition to high numbers of abortions during the epidemic, unusual cystic structures were noted in the ovaries of several morbillivirus-infected dolphins with high PCB levels. These structures were identified as multiple luteinized cysts from their gross and histomorphologic characteristics. No morbillivirus antigens were detected in the lesions by immunohistochemistry. Because luteinized cysts occur when ovulation is impeded, either an effect of morbillivirus or PCB's on hypothalamic/pituitary function or an effect of PCB's on ovarian responsiveness are proposed as pathogenic mechanisms. These cysts may impede population recovery from the epidemic if similar cysts occurred on surviving dolphins.<br>

<b>NAL Call Number:</b>  TA166.J6<br>
<b>Abstract:</b>  Many bones within the axial and appendicular skeleton are subjected to repetitive loading during the course of ordinary daily activities. If this loading is of sufficient magnitude or duration, failure of the bone tissue may result. Until recently the structural analysis of these fractures has been limited to two-dimensional sections. Due to the inherent destructiveness of this method, dynamic assessment of fracture progression has not been possible. An image-guided technique to analyze structural failure has been developed utilizing step-wise micro-compression in combination with time-lapsed micro-computed tomographic imaging. This technique allows, for the first time, direct three-dimensional visualization and quantification of fracture initiation and progression on the microscopic level and relates the global failure properties of trabecular bone to those of the individual trabeculae. The goals of this project were first to design and fabricate a novel micro-mechanical testing system, composed of a micro-compression device and a material testing and data acquisition system; and second, to validate the testing system to perform step-wise testing of trabecular bone specimens based on image-guided failure analysis. Due to the rate dependant properties of bone, stress relaxation was a concerning factor with respect to the step-wise testing method. In order to address these concerns, the results of the step-wise testing method were compared to those obtained from a conventional continuous test (considered to be the gold standard for the step-wise compressive mechanical testing) over the same total strain range and testing conditions. This was performed using porous aluminum alloy samples with highly reproducible and homogenous structural properties as well as trabecular bone samples from a single whale vertebra. Five cylinders from aluminum foam and trabecular whale bone each were compressed and imaged in a step-wise fashion from 0% to 20% strain at intervals of 2%, 4%, 8%, 12%, 16% and 20%. Mechanical properties obtained from the continuous and step-wise methods were not significantly different for both aluminum foam and whale bone specimens (p&gt;0.05). Both testing methods yielded very similar stress-strain graphs with almost identical elastic and plastic regions with overlaying standard error bars for both whale bone and aluminum foam specimens. This was further concurred by performing regression analyses between the stress data from both testing methods (r(2)=0.98 for whale bone and aluminum foam specimens). Animations of fracture initiation and progression revealed that failure always occurred in local bands with the remaining regions of the structure largely unaffected independent of structure type. In conclusion, we found step-wise micro-compression to be a valid approach for image-guided failure assessment (IGFA) with high precision and accuracy as compared to classical continuous testing. We expect findings from upcoming studies of IGFA of human vertebral bone to improve our understanding of the relative importance of densitometric, morphological, and loading factors in the etiology of spontaneous fractures of the spine. Eventually, this improved understanding may lead to more successful approaches to the prevention of age-related fatigue fractures.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  The capture-release of odontocetes allows for tag deployment which provides an opportunity to study behaviour and habitat use by free-ranging animals, as well as clinical assessment of the animal and tissue collection. This review recognises those elements that are common to most capture and tagging projects, identifies collective knowledge of animal and human health concerns during handling of odontocetes and provides guidelines for safer handling techniques. Handling during tagging projects can involve chase, capture, restraint, manipulation, tag application, often removal from the water and release at the capture site. The risk of injury during capture will be reduced by using experienced personnel, adequate technical support and proper equipment. For the duration of the handling process, the animal's stimulus response should be monitored as well as its cardiovascular and respiratory function. Stress response of the odontocete is monitored by behavioural assessments, physiological monitoring and/or blood sampling. Possible complications from tag placement may include infection at the implant site leading to tag failure, behavioural alterations in response to tag placement and tag rejection. During handling of an odontocete, there is the potential for disease transmission between humans and the animal. Exposure to diseases is minimised by wearing protective clothing and gear and exercising caution when working around the animal's blowhole.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  Although Risso's dolphin, <i>Grampus griseus</i> Gray, 1828, has a world-wide distribution, in New Zealand waters only 12 individuals (including those in five strandings) have been reported. None of the 12 is stated to have been malformed. We report the presence of abnormalities in the vertebral column and 13th ribs of a female Risso's dolphin found dead at Mahia, Hawkes Bay, on 28th October, 1987. The 305 kg cadaver was 2.85 metres long. We later estimated that had the vertebral column been normal, the animal's length would have been 3.10 metres. The cadaver had a bulbous head, four pairs of teeth on each side of the mandible, a large, caudally placed dorsal fin, a uniform gray coloration broken ventrally from caudal neck to anus by a clearly demarcated, symmetrical whitish-pink area of varying width and numerous longitudinal cuts approximately.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  Stranded cetaceans reported from the territorial waters of Hong Kong during the period May 1993 to March 1998 were examined to establish factors that may have contributed to their death. During the current study, 28 Indo-Pacific hump-backed dolphins (<i>Sousa chinensis</i>), 32 finless porpoises (<i>Neophocaena phocaenoides</i>), and four bottlenose dolphins (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>) were necropsied. Bacteria (15 species) were isolated from nine animals. Of these bacteria, 47% were of possible fecal origin reflecting the high level of sewage contamination in Hong Kong's waters. One finless porpoise displayed wounds caused by a shark attack, and two female finless porpoises presented prolapsed uteri. At least 10 finless porpoises showed evidence of moderate to heavy lungworm infections (<i>Halocercus pingi</i>), and this appears to have been a factor contributing to death in at least six animals. Evidence suggesting blunt traumatic injury (probably caused by boat collisions) was found in six cetaceans (three finless porpoises and three hump-backed dolphins). Signs of fishery-related mortality were detected in at least nine animals (six hump-backed dolphins, two finless porpoises, and one bottlenose dolphin). Of these two human-caused mortality types, pre-existing disease or bacterial infection were detected in 29% of cases. Results indicate that human factors may have played a significant role in the death of at least 15 animals (32% of hump-backed dolphins, 15% of finless porpoises, and 25% of bottlenose dolphins).<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  Different combinations of biopsy tip lengths (20, 25 mm) and diameters (5, 6, 7 mm), crossbow draw weights (23, 45, 68 kg) and distances (1.5-15 m) were tested on fresh beluga carcasses to determine factors affecting the success of biopsy retrieval and the extent of wounding. Tips with smaller diameters and longer lengths were found to be more likely to retrieve a skin sample, while the draw weight of the crossbow had a significant effect on the severity of the wound. The samples obtained from all biopsy darts tested yielded sufficient amounts of DNA for genetic analysis (20-109 mu-g) with the highest yield coming from the germinativum spinosum layer. For beluga whales we recommend using a tip of 5 mm in diameter, 25 mm in length, and a draw weight of 23 kg at close range.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  We do not yet know why whales occasionally strand after sonar has been deployed nearby, but such information is important for both naval undersea activities and the protection of marine mammals. Jepson et al. suggest that a peculiar gas-forming disease afflicting some stranded cetaceans could be a type of decompression sickness (DCS) resulting from exposure to mid-range sonar. However, neither decompression theory nor observation support the existence of a naturally occurring DCS in whales that is characterized by encapsulated, gas-filled cavities in the liver. Although gas-bubble formation may be aggravated by acoustic energy, more rigorous investigation is needed before sonar can be firmly linked to bubble formation in whales.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  A stranded young pygmy sperm whale was nursed for four days in a pool, fed an artificial diet via a stomach tube and injected intramuscularly with antibiotics and corticosteroids. Initially unable to maintain her balance or to swim, she showed progressive improvement and by the third day could swim and dive quite strongly. Early on the fifth day her condition rapidly worsened and she died. An autopsy revealed extensive deep bruising in the head and mid-abdominal regions consistent with injuries sustained during the stranding.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  The design and implementation of conservation plans for marine mammals is a matter of public concern. However, very little is known about the role of parasites in the dynamics of marine mammal populations. This is probably due to methodological constraints concerning sampling biases, poor knowledge of the biology of the hosts and parasites and difficulty and costy of experimental studies. However, current evidence supports the theory that parasites may regulate marine mammal populations. Crassicauda species in cetaceans and <i>Uncinaria lucasi</i> in pinnipeds seem good candidates as regulating agents. In addition, parasite-induced mass mortalities may be important in marine mammal populations. Well documented cases are the PDV virus which decimated the European common seal (<i>Phoca vitulina</i>) populations in 1988 and the Mediterranean striped dolphin (<i>Stenella coeruleoalba</i>) morbillivirus infection of 1990-1992. Due to the social organisation patterns of marine mammals it is possible that such die-offs occur at very low densities, representing a potential threat to endangered species like the Mediterranean monk seal (<i>Monachus monachus</i>), the Hawaiian monk seal (<i>M. schauinslandi</i>) or the Finish Saimaa seal (<i>Phoca hispida saimensis</i>). It is concluded that parasites can play an important role in marine mammal populations not only at the ecological scale but at the evolutionary one too.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  A 4-yr-old male bottlenose dolphin (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>) developed an <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> pneumonia. Fungal elements were identified by cytology and microbiology from endoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage and brushings of a raised yellow endobronchial lesion. The results of qualitative immunodiffusion serology, a technique that identifies specific circulating antibodies to <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i>, were suggestive of an active infection. The dolphin was treated with itraconazole for over 2 yr, which resulted in remission of clinical signs. Pneumonia caused by <i>Aspergillus</i> sp. accounts for the large majority of pulmonary mycoses in marine mammals. Bronchoscopy facilitated an early definitive diagnosis, accurate treatment, and remission.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  Transabdominal ultrasonography and serum steroid concentrations were used to evaluate the effects of exogenous gonadotropin administration on ovarian activity of two anestrous bottlenose dolphins (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>). The gonadotropin used for follicular recruitment was PG600, which has 400 IU equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG) and 200 IU human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) activity per 5 ml. Ovulation induction was attempted with hCG. PG600 was administered in two doses of 20 ml (1,600 IU eCG and 800 IU hCG) and 12.5 ml (1,000 IU eCG and 500 IU hCG), respectively, 48 hr apart on days 0 and 2. On day 6, 1,500 IU of hCG was administered. Progesterone and total immunoreactive estrogens were determined before and after the gonadotropin administration. Bilateral ovarian ultrasonographic exams were performed daily on days 4-9 and on day 22. Serum immunoreactive estrogen concentrations were greater than the pretreatment concentrations after day 4 for both dolphins and remained elevated for the rest of the study. Serum progesterone concentrations rose above 1 ng/ml 2 days after hCG treatment and remained elevated for the rest of the study. Small antral follicles (&lt; 0.5 cm) were initially observed bilaterally in both dolphins on day 4. In both animals on day 9, there were &gt; 12 follicles/ovary, ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 cm. By day 22, the multiple follicles ranged from 0.5 to 4.5 cm in diameter. No ultrasonographic evidence of luteal formation was observed. The results indicate that 1) transabdominal ultrasonography can be used to detect and follow follicle growth in bottlenose dolphins; 2) bottlenose dolphins are sensitive to exogenous gonadotropins (multiple follicular recruitment of follicles occurred); and 3) until further ultrasonographic studies can be conducted to evaluate the effects of titrated doses of exogenous gonadotropins, these protocols should be considered unsuitable for ovulation induction.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  Research was conducted to define the basic reproductive physiology of killer whales (<i>Orcinus orca</i>) and to use this knowledge to facilitate the development of artificial insemination procedures. The specific objectives were 1) to determine the excretory dynamics of urinary LH and ovarian steroid metabolites during the estrous cycle; 2) to evaluate the effect of an exogenously administered, synthetic progesterone analog on reproductive hormone excretion; 3) to validate the use of transabdominal ultrasound for ovarian evaluation and timing of ovulation; 4) to examine the quality of semen after liquid storage and cryopreservation; and 5) to develop an intrauterine insemination technique. Based on urinary endocrine monitoring of 41 follicular phases and 26 complete cycles from five females, estrous cycles were 41 days long and comprised a 17-day follicular phase and a 21-day luteal phase. A consistent temporal relationship was observed between peak estrogen conjugates and the LH surge, the latter of which occurred approximately 0.5 days later. Two animals placed on oral altrenogest (three separate occasions for 30, 17, and 31 days, respectively) excreted peak urinary estrogen concentrations 25 days after withdrawal that were followed by sustained elevations in urinary pregnanediol-3alpha-glucuronide excretion. Mean preovulatory follicle diameter was 3.9 cm (n = 6), and ovulation occurred 38 h (n = 5) after the peak of the LH surge. Based on visual estimates of motility, liquid-stored semen maintained 92% of its raw ejaculate sperm motility index (total progressive motility x kinetic rating [0-5 scale, where 0 = no movement and 5 = rapid progressive movement]) when held at 4 degrees C for 3 days postcollection. Semen cryopreserved using a medium freezing rate demonstrated good postthaw total motility (50%), progressive motility (94%), and kinetic rating (3.5). Insemination during eight estrous cycles resulted in three pregnancies (38%), two from liquid-stored and one from cryopreserved semen. Two calves were delivered after gestation lengths of 552 and 554 days, respectively. These data demonstrate the potential of noninvasive endocrine monitoring combined with serial ultrasonography to improve our understanding of the reproductive biology of cetaceans. This fundamental knowledge was essential for ensuring the first successful conceptions, resulting in live offspring, using artificial insemination in any cetacean species.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  In the present paper, an electronic prototype designed to acquire electrocardiographic signals from marine mammals has been developed. The system consists of a portable device that allows the on-line acquisition of EKG signals through a parallel port interface that is connected to a laptop computer. The EKG waveform, the voltage level, the bandwidth and the most relevant information from this type of signals is stored and analysed under real-time conditions by means of specifically implemented software. The whole system has been successfully tested to obtain the EKG from captive dolphins. The characteristics of the equipment presented here, with its low cost, size and energy requirements accomplish a portable system suitable for the acquisition of this type of signals in conductive media such as the seawater.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  With the aim of knowing the concentration and distribution of essential and nonessential metals in selected tissues of whales, analysis of Cd, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb and Zn were carried out in kidney, liver and muscle of the gray whale <i>Eschrichtius robustus</i> and the sperm whale <i>Physeter catodon</i>. Whales were found stranded in the southeast Gulf of California. Individuals were in a juvenile stage; mean length of whales was 9.3 m for <i>E. robustus</i> and 7 m for <i>P. catodon</i>. Sequence of metal concentrations was Fe&gt;Zn&gt;Cu&gt;Mn&gt;Cd&gt;Pb in <i>E. robustus</i>, and Fe&gt;Zn&gt;Cu&gt;Cd&gt;Mn&gt;Pb in <i>P. catodon</i>. In <i>E. robustus</i>, highest concentrations of Cu, Mn, Pb and Zn (17.2, 19.6, 0.9 and 388 microg g(-1), respectively) were measured in liver, Cd (5.7 microg g(-1)) in kidney and Fe (1009 microg g(-1)) in muscle. In <i>P. catodon</i>, the highest levels of Cu, Fe and Pb (48.6, 5200 and 4.2 microg g(-1), respectively) were found in liver, Cd and Zn (94 and 183 microg g(-1)) in kidney and Mn (8 microg g(-1)) in muscle. Metal concentrations reported here were not considered to contribute to the stranding of specimens.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  In the last 13 years, four viruses belonging in the Morbillivirus genus of the Paramyxoviridae family have emerged as significant causes of disease and mortality in marine mammals. The viruses involved are canine distemper virus (CDV) in seals and polar bears, dolphin morbillivirus (DMV) and porpoise morbillivirus (PMV) in cetaceans, and phocine distemper virus (PDV) in pinnipeds. The two cetacean morbilliviruses (DMV and PMV) are now considered to be the same viral species, named cetacean morbillivirus (CMV). All three morbillivirus species (CDV, CMV, and PDV) are genetically and antigenically related and cross-react in various serological tests. The diagnosis of morbilliviral infections in marine mammal specimens poses two challenges. First, various marine mammal species can be infected by more than one closely related but distinct morbilliviruses, making definitive virus identification unattainable by classical virology methods. Second, standard immunological reagents such as anti-species conjugates are unavailable for most marine mammal species, rendering definitive serological diagnosis difficult by classical serological techniques. The objectives of this study were to develop two diagnostic approaches that alleviate these difficulties, providing simple, rapid, and cost-effective diagnostic methods. For nucleic acid detection, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and restriction endonuclease digestions were used to differentiate the three viruses. For antibody detection, a monoclonal antibody-based competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (c-ELISA) was used on sera from several species, thus avoiding the need for multiple anti-species enzyme conjugates.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  OBJECTIVE: To examine haematological features in five species of healthy, captive marine mammals. ANIMALS: Twenty bottlenose dolphins <i>(Tursips truncatus</i>), seven Pacific white-sided dolphins (<i>Lagenorhynchus obliquidens</i>), five Risso dolphins (<i>Grampus griseus</i>) and five false killer whales (<i>Pseudorca crassidens</i>). RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The red blood cell count was 4.21 x 10(12)/L in bottlenose dolphins, 5.32 x 10(12)/L in Pacific white-sided dolphins, 4.35 x 10(12)/L in Risso dolphins and 4.43 x 10(12)/L in false killer whales. The haemoglobin concentration was 1.51 g/L and packed cell volume 44.7% in bottlenose dolphins; the corresponding values were 1.71 g/L and 48.9% in Pacific white-sided dolphins, 1.72 g/L and 49.4% in Risso dolphins, and 1.52 g/L and 47.8% in false killer whales. The white blood cell count was 7.097 x 10(9)/L in bottlenose dolphins, 5.928 x 10(9)/L in Pacific white-sided dolphins, 5.001 x 10(9)/L in Risso dolphins and 7.921 x 10(9)/L in false killer whales. There were no significant differences in these values among bottlenose dolphins and Pacific white-sided dolphins. The proportion of eosinophils in the differential leukocyte count ranged from 10.3% to 11.5% in bottlenose dolphins, Pacific white-sided dolphins and false killer whales, but was only 0.4% in Risso dolphins. The eosinophilic granules were larger in Risso dolphins and false killer whales than in bottlenose and Pacific white-sided dolphins.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  Heat transfer from skin surface to ambient water is probably the most important aspect of thermal balance in marine mammals, but the respective calculations depend on knowing the surface temperature (TS), the direct measurement of which in free animals is very difficult. An indirect iterative method is proposed for TS prediction in free cetaceans from deep body temperature, swimming speed, and temperature and thermodynamic properties of the water.<br>

<b>NAL Call Number:</b>  QL713.2.M372<br>
<b>Abstract:</b>  An estimate of how long marine mammals need to acclimate to captivity would permit more precise comparisons of husbandry practices, yet no quantitative analysis of acclimation has been performed. Therefore, we estimated the duration of acclimation to captivity for bottlenose dolphins (BD) and California sea lions (CSL) by comparing 5-d survival rates during the first 90 d of captivity with a survival rate based on days 91-365 in captivity. Wild-born BD (n = 1,270) and CSL (n = 1,650) acclimate to captivity in approximately 35 and 40 d, respectively, whereas captive born BD (n = 332) and CSL (n = 992) acclimate in approximately 50 and 40 d, respectively. When transferred between two institutions, BD (n = 911) acclimated in the same amount of time (45 d) as when first transferred from the wild, whereas transferred CSL (n = 336) acclimated more rapidly (15 vs. 40 d) than when first transferred from the wild. Based on results from these two species, a 60-d acclimation period is recognized as a distinct interval of relatively high mortality that should be treated separately from long-term survival estimates when evaluating husbandry practices of oceanaria and zoos.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  Xenon and dichloromethane are inhalational anesthetic agents whose binding to myoglobin has been demonstrated by X-ray crystallography. We explore the thermodynamic significance of such binding using differential scanning calorimetry, circular dichroism spectroscopy, and hydrogen-tritium exchange measurements to study the effect of these agents on myoglobin folding stability. Though specific binding of these anesthetics might be expected to stabilize myoglobin against unfolding, dichloromethane actually destabilized myoglobin at all examined concentrations of this anesthetic (15, 40, and 200 mM). On the other hand, xenon (1 atm) stabilized myoglobin. Thus, dichloromethane and xenon have opposite effects on myoglobin stability despite localization in comparably folded X-ray crystallographic structures. These results suggest a need for solution measurements to complement crystallography if the consequences of weak binding to proteins are to be appreciated.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  Components of the peripheral visual pathway were examined in two bottlenose dolphins, <i>Tursiops truncatus</i>, each with unilateral ocular degeneration and scarring of 3 or more years' duration. In both animals, the optic nerve associated with the blind eye (right eye in Tg419 and left eye in Tt038) had a translucent, gel-like appearance upon gross examination. This translucency was also evident in the optic tract contralateral to the affected eye. In Tg419, myelinated axons of varying diameters were apparent in the left optic nerve, whereas the right optic nerve, serving the blind eye, appeared to be devoid of axons. In Tt038, myelinated axons were associated with the right optic nerve (serving the functional eye) and left optic tract but were essentially absent in the left optic nerve and right optic tract. Examined by light microscopy in serial horizontal sections, the optic chiasm of Tt038 was arranged along its central plane in segregated, alternating pathways for the decussation of right and left optic nerve fibers. Ventral to this plane, the chiasm was comprised of fibers from the left optic nerve, whereas dorsal to the central plane, fibers derived from the right optic nerve. Because of this architectural arrangement, the right and left optic nerves grossly appeared to overlap as they crossed the optic chiasm with the right optic nerve coursing dorsally to the left optic nerve. At the light and electron microscopic levels, the optic nerves and tracts lacking axons were well vascularized and dominated by glial cell bodies and glial processes, an expression of the marked glial scarring associated with postinjury axonal degeneration. The apparent absence of axons in one of the optic tract pairs (right in Tt038 and left in Tg419) supports the concept of complete decussation of right and left optic nerve fibers at the optic chiasm in the bottlenose dolphin.<br>

<b>NAL Call Number:</b>  447.8 AN1<br>
<b>Abstract:</b>  BACKGROUND: Specialized demands within the aquatic environment for over some 60 million years have shaped unique morphological expressions in the whales, dolphins, and porpoises (Cetacea). Detailed consideration of these features, particularly in the great whales, has often been constrained by difficulties in securing adequate specimens for study. We had the opportunity to examine external heart morphology in a rarely obtained and prepared specimen from the bowhead whale, <i>Balaena mysticetus</i>. METHODS: The external morphology and in situ relations of a formalin-perfused heart were examined grossly in a near-term bowhead fetus. Latex injections assisted visualization of coronary vasculature. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to clarify heart positioning within the thoracic cavity in two younger (early and mid-gestational) intact fetuses. RESULTS: The heart was globular in form, with a blunt apex and wide base; it was laterally broad relative to height yet considerably compressed between nearly planar atrial (diaphragmatic) and auricular (sternocostal) surfaces. The heart constituted 0.01 of body mass in the near-term fetus. Within the thoracic cavity, the heart tilted forward on its long axis, placing the great basal vessels in the region of the thoracic inlet. The aorta extended forward from mid-base in parallel with the pulmonary trunk, arched sharply to the left, producing in succession the brachiocephalic trunk, left common carotid artery, and the left subclavian artery. Bifurcation of the brachiocephalic trunk yielded the right common carotid and right subclavian arteries. The distal portion of the aortic arch was linked to the pulmonary trunk via the ductus arteriosus. The aorta then swung caudally over the heart base, descending beneath the bodies of the thoracic vertebrae. The ascending aorta featured three bulbous sinuses immediately distal to the three semilunar cusps of the aortic valve. Originating along the distal boundaries of the left and right sinuses were the left and right coronary arteries. The arteries were similar in size and, because each sent contributions along their respective coronary and interventricular grooves, the heart can be described as bilateral relative to arterial supply. Anastomoses were common within and between the two arteries. Venous return from the heart was comprised of the great, middle, and right cardiac veins, all three converging in the coronary sinus. The right cardiac vein also included tributaries that emptied directly into the right atrium. CONCLUSIONS: External heart morphology in the fetal bowhead whale examined was distinguished by a laterally broad conformation with significant compression between its cranial and caudal surfaces. Aortic bulb configuration in combination with an expandable aortic arch may support blood service to the heart during diastole. Vascular service to the heart featured a complex vessel network with extensive intraarterial and intravenous anastomoses that enable many alternate blood perfusion pathways and may be adaptive to water-column-pressure fluctuations experienced by a large diving mammal.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  The midsagittal surface area of the corpus callosum was determined by computer-assisted morphometry in juvenile and adult members of 13 species of the cetacean family Delphinidae. In 57 brains, absolute callosal areas ranged from 104 to 829 mm2. When compared to other mammal groups possessing a corpus callosum, callosal area in dolphins was smaller in relation to brain mass with a ratio range (mm2/g) of 0.08-0.31. The corpus callosum was decreased relative to brain mass in the larger-brained odontocetes, suggesting that increases in brain size were not necessarily allied with needs for equivalent increases in callosal linkage. One delphinid species, <i>Tursiops truncatus</i>, for which the largest single-species sample was available, was examined for sex differences in callosal size relative to brain mass. Among 10 males and 5 females the averaged ratio was not distinguishable between sexes.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  To determine how blood values in bottlenose dolphins changed during the year, 504 blood samples were taken from 9 dolphins from 1991 to 1999 and clinical blood examinations were undertaken monthly including 3 hematological and 19 serum chemistry tests. In creatinine, significant seasonal changes were found among three groups of adult males, adult females and juveniles, and the average values in summer were 15-38% higher than those in winter. In two out of three groups the average total cholesterol value were highest in winter, and the lowest of all groups were in summer. In two other groups the peaks of average FFA value were recorded in summer, and the lows were in winter.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  Bronchoscopy is a standard diagnostic and therapeutic procedure in respiratory medicine and has been performed on many animal species. Cetaceans suffer considerable morbidity and mortality from lower respiratory tract infections, and it is very difficult to sample lower respiratory tract secretions for microbiology and other analyses. We report our experience on performing fiberoptic bronchoscopy in three bottle-nosed dolphins (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>) and one false killer whale (<i>Pseudorca crassidens</i>), which should help other clinicians in performing bronchoscopy in cetaceans.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  During necropsy of cetaceans stranded or accidentally net-captured along the western coast of the Gulf of Mexico from 1991 to 1996, we found 13 of 59 (22%) animals had abnormalities of the atlanto-occipital and/or humeroscapular joints, the synovial joints. A few cases demonstrated mild roughening of the articular cartilage, while the majority exhibited complete erosion with thickened synovium and bony proliferation. The lesions resulted in ankylosis of both joints in one animal. In humans and terrestrial mammals, synovial joint diseases are known to be debilitating. Cetaceans depend on neck and flipper movement for locomotion, feeding, avoiding danger, and reaching the water's surface for breathing. Therefore, synovial joint disease may be significant mortality factor in these marine animals.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  Reproductive hormone profiles of six captive killer whales (<i>Orcinu orcus</i>) from three Sea World aquaria were studied for intervals up to 2 yr. Daily urine samples and bimonthly blood samples were collected and analyzed for hormone concentration. Immunoreactive estrone conjugates, pregnanediol-3-glucoruonide, 20-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone as well as bioactive follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) were measured in urine samples and indexed by creatinine concentrations of the same sample. In selected cases, serum progesterone concentrations were also measured. Three of the animals in the study became pregnant during the study period and two of these animals were evaluated during the time of conception and throughout most of gestation. From the data of the three animals that conceived, hormone profiles of the complete ovarian cycle, early pregnancy, and mid- to late gestation are described. The remaining three animals did not conceive and only one of these demonstrated hormone changes that indicated regular ovarian activity. The female reproductive pattern of the killer whale is characterized by a gestation of 17 mo and an ovarian cycle of 6-7 wk in duration. The hormone changes associated with the ovarian cycle of the killer whale are similar to those of most other mammalian species. A bimodal pattern of bioactive FSH with a pronounced rise of estrogen predominates the preovulatory hormone profile. After ovulation, increased progesterone production is observed for approximately 4 wk in the nonconceptive ovarian cycle. During the luteal phase and early pregnancy, when progesterone metabolites are elevated, estrogen metabolite excretion remains low. These data extend the application of urine collections for longitudinal studies involving hormone changes, particularly those involving nondomesticated species.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  Marine mammals are known for their low susceptibility to mercury toxicity, and selenium may play a role in this protection against mercury intoxication. To gain insight into mechanisms by which selenium might inhibit mercury toxicity in cetacean cells, we investigated the effects of sodium selenite on cell proliferation and cell death (including apoptosis, oncosis, and necrosis) of control and mercuric chloride-treated Atlantic spotted dolphin renal cells (Sp1K cells). Concurrent exposure to 80 microM Na2SeO3 provided full protection against the decrease in cell proliferation induced by 20 microM HgCl2. Pretreatment with Na2SeO3 increased the protective effects of selenium administered later in conjunction with mercury, but pretreatment alone did not provide protection against mercury given alone. Furthermore, Na2SeO3 administered after the exposure to HgCl2 did not protect cells. These data suggest that the coexistence of Na2SeO3 and HgCl2 was essential for the protective effects of Na2SeO3 against the toxicity of HgCl2 in Sp1K cells, and may involve selenium-mercury binding. This is supported by the results of an experiment in which earlier premixed mercury and selenium solutions were less cytotoxic than freshly mixed solutions. Furthermore, HgCl2 induced apoptosis in Sp1K cells, as revealed by nuclear specific dye (7-AAD) incorporation and cell flow cytometry, and this was prevented by the concurrent exposure to Na2SeO3. Inhibition of mercury-induced apoptosis in marine mammal cells, provided by selenium, may contribute to the in vivo protection. This study is the first report that addresses the mechanism of mercury-selenium antagonism in cultured cetacean cells at the cellular level.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  High mercury concentrations have been reported in various tissues of cetaceans, but the toxicological effects of mercury on cetaceans remain unclear. In vivo study is difficult due to the endangered status of these marine mammals and co-exposure to both mercury and selenium (antagonist of mercury) in the oceanic environment. The present data are the first ultrastructural information on dolphin renal cells exposed to mercury in vitro. Multiple organelle changes were observed in Atlantic spotted dolphin (<i>Stenella plagiodon</i>) renal cells treated with mercuric chloride (HgCl2) or methylmercury chloride (MeHgCl2). Mitochondria and rough endoplasmic reticula were swollen after treatment with HgCl2 or MeHgCl. Mitochondrial dense bodies and small cytoplasmic spherical granules of high electron density were also observed after exposure to MeHgCl. Cytoplasmic vacuoles and myelin-like figures were induced by both HgCl2 and MeHgCl. Nuclear changes included karyolysis, nuclear buds, and a novel observation in mercury-treated cells, vacuolization of (micro-)nucleoli after treatment with HgCl2. These morphological changes (multiple organelle damage and nuclear budding) indicated mercury-treated dolphin renal cells underwent oncosis and necrosis, and supported earlier pathophysiologic findings of diverse toxic actions on genetic, respiratory and other cellular functions.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  A captive-born, 7-year-old male bottlenose dolphin (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>) suddenly acquired a dorsal hump at the cranial base of its dorsal fin. Subsequent clinical signs or swimming abnormalities were not observed and one year later it died suddenly. Necropsy revealed chronic cholangiohepatitis and lymphadenitis suggestive of a viral infection, with kyphoscoliosis centered on an old malunion compression fracture of the 12th thoracic vertebra associated with moderate bony proliferation, fusion, and lysis of this and adjacent vertebrae. Possible causes of fractures, particularly conspecific aggression, and the remarkable functional longevity of dolphins with vertebral malformations are discussed.<br>

Biological Sciences</i> 266(1423): 1077-83.  ISSN: 0962-8452.<br>
<b>Abstract:</b>  Experimental studies have highlighted the potential influence of contaminants on marine mammal immune function and anthropogenic contaminants are commonly believed to influence the development of diseases observed in the wild. However, estimates of the impact of contaminants on wild populations are constrained by uncertainty over natural variation in disease patterns under different environmental conditions. We used photographic techniques to compare levels of epidermal disease in ten coastal populations of bottlenose dolphins (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>) exposed to a wide range of natural and anthropogenic conditions. Epidermal lesions were common in all populations (affecting &gt; 60% of individuals), but both the prevalence and severity of 15 lesion categories varied between populations. No relationships were found between epidermal disease and contaminant levels across the four populations for which toxicological data were available. In contrast, there were highly significant linear relationships with oceanographic variables. In particular, populations from areas of low water temperature and low salinity exhibited higher lesion prevalence and severity. Such conditions may impact on epidermal integrity or produce more general physiological stress, potentially making animals more vulnerable to natural infections or anthropogenic factors. These results show that variations in natural environmental factors must be accounted for when investigating the importance of anthropogenic impacts on disease in wild marine mammals.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  Vaginal calculi have been described from the common (<i>Delphinus delphis)</i>, Pacific white-sided (<i>Lagenorhynchus obliquidens</i>) and spotted (<i>Stenella attenuata</i>) dolphins. We describe additional calculi found in six sexually mature <i>D. delphis</i> from southern California. Three calculi were large (ca. 7 x 5 cm), exhibited concentric layer crystallization, and were unique from previously published descriptions. One calculus described previously and one in our sample appeared to be a fetal skeleton and skull respectively. Using CAT scans of a first trimester northern right whale dolphin (<i>Lissodelphis borealis</i>) and of a near term <i>Delphinus delphis</i>, we discuss the potential origin and development of vaginal calculi through analysis of ossification in embryonic delphinids. We hypothesize that the calculi represented spontaneous incomplete abortion with retention of part or all of the fetus in the distal reproductive tract. The form of the calculus relates to the degree of skeletal development at the time of fetal death. Calculi from a pregnant dolphin provided one measure of residence time.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  Concentrations of Fe, Zn, Cu, Se, Mn, Mo, Hg, Cd, Cr, Ag, Pb, Sr and V were determined in skins of Dall's porpoises (<i>Phocoenoides dali</i>) of the Pacific coast truei-type population (PT population) (N = 45), and the Sea of Japan-Okhotsk dalli-type population (JD population) (N = 31) from the northern waters of Japan. Cutaneous Hg concentrations in both PT and JD populations were significantly correlated with age, indicating a possible alternative method of age estimation. A significant correlation was also noted between Hg concentrations in skin and liver, suggesting that biopsy samples of skin can provide a non-lethal surrogate for monitoring Hg contamination in this species. Trace element accumulation patterns differed strongly between PT and JD populations, when analyzed by principal component analysis, suggesting these patterns could be utilized as non-lethal tracers of population identification.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  A mature male Risso's dolphin (<i>Grampus griseus</i>) stranded along the coasts of Friuli Venezia Giulia, northeast Italy, in May 2001. Parasitic infection with <i>Crassicauda grampicola</i> is often found in the tympanic bullae and pterygoid sinuses in many of the Risso's dolphins examined from the same area. For this reason, it was decided to perform computed tomography of the head to assess this imaging technique for the diagnosis of crassicaudosis in dolphins. A full postmortem examination confirmed the pathologic findings of the computed tomography scan. This technique can be considered a useful adjunct in the diagnosis of cranial crassicaudosis in live dolphins.<br>
