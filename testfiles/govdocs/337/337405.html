    <td>We’ve come a long way since the first census in 1790 that counted 3.9 
      million people.&nbsp; Then the census was taken in the 13 original states, 
      plus the districts of Kentucky, Maine, Vermont, and the Southwest Territory 
      (of Tennessee).&nbsp;&nbsp; Federal Marshalls asked six questions:&nbsp; 
      name of head of family and number of persons in household, and the number 
      of persons in each household of the following descriptions:&nbsp; Free White 
      males 16 years and upward, free White males under 16 years, free White females, 
      all other free persons (by sex and color) and slaves.&nbsp; 
      <p>In the 210 years since the first census, the census has grown to a sophisticated 
        tool.&nbsp; Census 2000, taken April 1, 2000, counted 281,421,906 people 
        in the 50 states and the District of Columbia.&nbsp; The questionnaire 
        included seven questions for each household:&nbsp; name, sex, age, relationship, 
        Hispanic origin, race, and whether the housing unit was owned or rented.&nbsp; 
        In addition to these seven questions, about 17 percent of the households 
        got a much longer questionnaire including questions about ancestry, income, 
        mortgage, and size of the housing unit.&nbsp; Census 2000 not only counted 
        the population, but also sampled the socio-economic status of the population, 
        providing a tool for government, educators, business owners, and others 
        to get a snapshot of the state of the nation.&nbsp;

        Importance Of The Census:&nbsp; What It Is Used For And Why&nbsp;</font></b> 
        </font> 
      <p>The U.S. Constitution, Article I, Section 2 mandates that an apportionment 
        of representatives among the states, for the House of Representatives, 
        be carried out every ten years (decennially).&nbsp; Apportionment is the 
        process of dividing the 435 seats in the US House of Representatives among 
        the 50 states.&nbsp; Congress decides the method to carry out the apportionment 
        and, since 1940, has used the method of ‘equal proportions’ in accordance 
        with Title 2, US Code.&nbsp;
      <p> <br>
        Using equal portions, each state is assigned one congressional seat (as 
        provided by the Constitution).&nbsp; The apportionment formula then allocates 
        the remaining 385 seats one at a time among the 50 states until all 435 
        seats are assigned.&nbsp; 
      <p>In addition to apportionment, the decennial census results are used to: 
      <ul>
        <li> distribute almost $200 billion annually in Federal and state, local, 
          and tribal funds;&nbsp;</li>
        <li> draw state legislative districts;</li>
        <li> evaluate the success of programs or identify populations in need 
          of services;&nbsp;</li>
        <li> and many other purposes.&nbsp; The URL <a href="http://www.census.gov/dmd/www/content.htm">http://www.census.gov/dmd/www/content.htm</a> 
          has a comprehensive review of each of the questions and why it is asked.</li>

      <p>While the federal government uses census data for many purposes, businesses, 
        students, and many others also user census data.&nbsp; Businesses may 
        use the data to decide where to locate an outlet, or to select products 
        for a specific area.&nbsp; Students research neighborhoods and cities 
        for class projects and the local parent-teacher organization may use data 
        to track trends in the local area.&nbsp; Historians, writers, and other 
        researchers use census data to get a flavor of what the country looked 
        like at a particular point in time.&nbsp;
