        Representatives, must be carried out every 10 years (decennially); and<br />

        and tenure were collected from 100 percent of the enumerated population. More detailed
        information, such as income, education, housing, occupation, and industry, was collected

    <td>Census 2000 was the last count of the U.S. 
        population collected by the U.S. Census Bureau. The U.S. Census Bureau’s primary
        method of data collection is to mail out questionnaires using the Master Address
        File, which includes information from the U.S. Postal Service and the Local Update
        of Census Addresses (LUCA) program, and by using enumerators. Enumerators are U.S.
        Census Bureau staff that travel door-to-door gathering data by canvassing roads
        and streets looking for living quarters. For Census 2000, as in several previous
        censuses, two forms were used—a short form and a long form. The short form was sent
        to every household, and the long form, containing the seven 100 percent questions
        plus the sample questions, was sent to only a limited number of households, about
        one in every six homes. The extended census form collects information on social,
        housing, economic, and financial characteristics. The national final response rate
        for Census 2000 was 67 percent. This exceeded the projected response rate of 61
        percent and was better than the 65 percent response rate from the 1990 census.</td>

    <td>There were several important survey question changes and/or
        additions for Census 2000. One such change deals with the question of race. The
        question on race on the 2000 census was based on OMB’s 1997. “Revisions of the Standards
        for the Classification of Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity.” The 1997 Standards
        incorporated two major changes in the collection, tabulation, and presentation of
        race data. First, the 1997 standards increased from four to five the minimum set
        of categories to be used by Federal agencies for identification of race: American
        Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or Other
        Pacific Islander, and white. Second, the 1997 standards included the requirement
        that Federal data collection programs allow respondents to select one or more race
        categories when responding to a query on their racial identity. One additional question added to Census 2000 asked
        about grandparents as caregivers while several questions from the 1990 census, including
        information about children ever born, source of water, sewage disposal, and condominium
        status, were dropped for Census 2000. Another important change for Census 2000 was
        the question on disability. In 1990, the question was .Does this person have a physical,
        mental or other health condition which has lasted for more than 6 months and that
        limits the amount of work this person can do at a job or prevents this person from
        working at a job. In 2000, the question was revised to inquire about blindness,
        deafness, and the ability to perform physical and mental tasks. Also in 1990, the
        questions on disability were asked for those 15 years and over; while in 2000, the
        data were collected for persons 5 years and over.</td>

        intercensal estimates for the preceding decade were prepared to replace the less
        accurate postcensal estimates. Intercensal population estimates take into account
        the census of population at the beginning and end of the decade. Thus intercensal
        estimates are more accurate than postcensal estimates because they correct for the

        data and W-2 self-employment data, and Medicare files.<br /><br />

        During each 2-year cycle of interviews, the HRS team surveys more than 20,000 people
        who represent the Nation’s diversity of economic conditions, racial and ethnic backgrounds,
        health, marital histories and family compositions, occupations and employment histories,
        living arrangements, and other aspects of life. Since 1992, more than 27,000 people
        have given 200,000 hours of interviews. The HRS is managed jointly through a cooperative
        agreement between the National Institute on Aging (NIA) and the Institute for Social
        Research (ISR) at the University of Michigan. 
        The study is designed, administered, and conducted by the ISR, and decisions about
        the study content are made by the investigators. The principal investigators at
        the University of Michigan are joined by a cadre of co-investigators and working
        group members who are leading academic researchers from across the United States
        in a variety of disciplines, including economics, medicine, demography, psychology,
        public health, and survey methodology. In addition, the NIA is advised by a Data Monitoring Committee 
        charged with maintaining HRS quality, keeping the survey relevant and attuned to the technical needs of researchers
        who use the data, and ensuring that it addresses the information needs of policymakers
        and the public.<br /><br />

        Since the study began, 7,000 people have registered to use the data, and nearly
        1,000 researchers have employed the data to publish more than 1,000 reports, including
        more than 600 peer-reviewed journal articles and book chapters, and 70 doctoral
        dissertations.<br /><br />

        The origins of the HRS date back to the mid-1980’s when the NIA and its advisors
        from demography, economics and sociology recognized that the Baby Boom and the subsequent
        fertility decline coupled with growing life expectancy would confront America with
        population aging which, in turn, would create major challenges for public sector
        Social Security retirement and disability and Medicare programs and for private
        sector employer pensions and health insurance when the Boomers began to retire around
        2010.<br /><br />

        HRS began in 1992 as a longitudinal study of a pre-retirement cohort of individuals
        born in 1931–41, and their spouses, who were 51–61 years old at baseline and receive
        longitudinal follow-up interviews at two year intervals. It was joined in 1993 by
        a companion study, AHEAD (Asset and Health Dynamics of the Oldest Old), consisting
        of a cohort of persons born before 1924 who were aged 70 and over, and their spouses.
        In 1998, this design was revised to convert the HRS from a study of specific cohorts
        into a steady state design that would represent the U.S. population over age 50
        by adding a new six year cohort of persons entering their 50s every six years. In
        1998, this design required the addition of the CODA (Children of the Depression)
        cohort born in 1924–30 who were entering their seventies and the War Baby Cohort
        born in 1942–47 who were entering their fifties. The longitudinal design has been
        continued with interviews of all existing cohorts in 2000, 2002 and 2004 and the steady state aspect
        has been carried forward with the addition in 2004 of the Early Baby Boomers (EBB)
        who were born in 1948–53 and age 51–56 at baseline. Between 1992 and 2002, the HRS
        conducted at least one interview with about 27,000 individuals with a total of 114,000
        taken. During that period 5000 participants died, and 4000 retirements took place.
        In 2004, HRS conducted 18,479 longitudinal follow-up interviews and 3,330 baseline
        interviews with the Early Boomers.</td>

    <td>The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), conducted by the
        National Center for Health Statistics, is a continuing nationwide sample survey in which data are
        collected during personal household interviews.The NHIS is the principal source
        of information on the health of the civilian, noninstitutionalized, household population
        of the United States. Interviewers collect data on illnesses, injuries, impairments, and chronic conditions;
        activity limitation caused by chronic conditions; utilization of health services;
        and other health topics. Information is also obtained on personal, social, economic,
        and demographic characteristics, including race and ethnicity and health insurance
        status. Each year the survey is reviewed, core questionnaire items are revised every
        10–15 years (with major revisions occurring in 1982 and 1997) and special topics
        are added or deleted annually.<br /><br />

        In 2006 a new sample design was implemented. This design, which is expected to be
        in use through 2014, includes all 50 states and the District of Columbia
        as the previous design did. Oversampling of the black and Hispanic populations has
        been retained in 2006 to allow for more precise estimation of health characteristics
        in these growing minority populations. The new sample design also oversamples the
        Asian population. In addition, the sample adult selection process has been revised
        so that when black, Hispanic, or Asian persons aged 65 years or older are present,
        they have an increased chance of being selected as the sample adult. The new design
        reduces the size of the NHIS by approximately 13 percent relative to the previous
        sample design. The interviewed sample for 2006 consisted of 29,204 households, which
        yielded 75,716 persons in 29,868 families. More information on the survey methodology
        and content of the NHIS can be found at <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis.htm" title="Link to Center for Disease Control" target="_blank">www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis.htm</a>.<br />

        official post-census estimates, as well as vital registration data from the
        National Center for Health Statistics. The assumptions are based on those used in the projections
        released in 2000 that used a 1998 population estimate base. Some modifications were

        total fertility rate in 2025 is 2.180, and it is projected to increase to 2.186

        at birth is assumed to increase to 81.2 for men and 86.7 for women. Net immigration
        is assumed to be 996,000 in 2025 and 1,097,000 in 2050.
