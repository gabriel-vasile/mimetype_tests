<P>These data tables of meteorological elements outline the climatic conditions
at major weather observing stations in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and
Pacific Islands. The data are from observing sites presently in use or
include data from former sites that are comparable in exposure. Stations
having less than three years of data for the current operating site are
omitted from the tables of observed data. Data in this publication have
been extracted from the Normals Means and Extremes table contained in the
<B><I>Local Climatological Data Annual Summary</I></B>, published for individual
stations. </P>

<H3>Stations are listed alphabetically by state. The tables are arranged
so that values of the same element can be compared for different locations
by use of a single table. Some weather stations do not regularly report
various elements and will therefore not be listed in the table for that
element. Asterisks (*) denote average frequency of occurrence greater than
zero, but smaller than one half. <BR>

to explain the data values in the data tables. </P>

<PRE>
I.Observed Data (Monthly and Annual) - These values are the

means and extremes for the Period of Record (number of

years) indicated. Period of record are documented in the

Local Climatological Data annual publications.



   A.        Temperature - Highest of Record, Degrees

             Fahrenheit (F)



   B.        Temperature - Lowest of Record, Degrees

             Fahrenheit (F)



             The annual temperature entry for each station

             represents the highest or lowest observed

             temperature in any month.



   C.        Mean Number of Days with Minimum Temperature

             32 Degrees F or less.



             The mean number of days with a minimum

             temperature of 32 degrees F or lower indicates

             the frequency of occurrence of days with

             freezing temperatures.



   D.        Mean number of Days with Precipitation 0.01

             Inches or More



             This table shows mean number of days per month

             with at least 0.01 inch of precipitation. 

             This is the smallest amount of precipitation

             numerically recorded, and includes the liquid

             water equivalent of frozen precipitation.  The

             frequency of days with precipitation should

             not be considered as frequency of cloudy days.



   E.        Snowfall (including ICE PELLETS and SLEET) -

             Average Total in Inches.



             NOTE:     Beginning in April 1988 HAIL is

                       also included under Snowfall. 

                       Therefore, some stations may

                       show snowfall during the warm

                       months.



   F.        Wind - Average Speed (MPH)



             The average wind speed is based on the speed

             of the wind regardless of direction.



   G.        Wind - Maximum Speed (MPH)



             This table expresses both a maximum wind speed

             for the stations and, where available, the

             direction (referenced to true North) from

             which it blew.  Short gusts are listed only

             for stations denoted with a (G).



             If the direction is expressed as one of the 16

             compass points (N, NNE, NE, etc.) the maximum

             speed is calculated from the minimum time

             during which one mile of wind passed the

             station.  Note that some stations that report

             short gusts (G) may also use the 16 compass

             point reference for wind direction.



             If the direction is expressed numerically, the

             maximum speed is the highest one minute

             average value recorded by the observer. 

             Direction is given in tens of degrees

             clockwise from true North.



   H.        Sunshine - Average Percentage of Possible



             The total time that sunshine reaches the

             surface of the earth is expressed as the

             percentage of the maximum amount possible from

             sunrise to sunset with clear sky conditions.



   I.        Cloudiness - Mean Number of Days - Clear (CL),

             Partly Cloudy (PC), Cloudy (CD)



             This table shows the mean number of days per

             category of cloudiness.  The categories are

             determined for daylight hours only.  Clear

             denotes zero to 3/10 average sky cover. 

             Partly cloudy denotes 4/10 to 7/10 average sky

             cover.  Cloudy denotes 8/10 to 10/10 average

             sky cover.



   J.        Average Relative Humidity (percent) - Morning

             (M) and Afternoon (A)



             The relative humidity is expressed as a

             percentage measure of the amount of moisture

             in the air compared to the maximum amount of

             moisture the air can hold at the same

             temperature and pressure.  Average humidity

             values are given for selected morning and

             afternoon observations.  Maximum relative

             humidity values usually occur during morning

             hours.  In this publication, the Local

             Standard Time (LST) of morning and afternoon

             humidities are shown below.

                           

Atlantic, Alaskan               (M morning 8 A.M.) (Afternoon 2 P.M.)

Eastern, Bering, 165W Meridian  (M morning 7 A.M.) (Afternoon 1 P.M.)

Central, 180E Meridian          (M morning 6 A.M.) (Afternoon NOON)

Mountain, 165E Meridian         (M morning 5 A.M.) (Afternoon 5 P.M.)

Pacific, 150E Meridian          (M morning 4 A.M.) (Afternoon 4 P.M.)

135E Meridian                   (M morning 9 A.M.) (Afternoon 3 P.M.)



II.  Climatological Normals (Monthly and Annual) - these

     are the 30-year average values computed from the data

     recorded during the period 1961-1990.  Normals are

     updated decennially, for the most recent 30-year

     period.  If an instruments exposure was changed,

     mathematical adjustments are made to make the data

     representative of the current location.  The values are

     statistically determined and cannot be recreated solely

     from the original record.



     A.        Normal Daily Maximum Temperature, Degrees F



     B.        Normal Daily Minimum Temperature, Degrees F.



     C.        Normal Daily Mean (Average) Temperature,

               Degrees F.



               In A, B, and C above, the temperature data are

               the normal daily values for each month. They

               have been adjusted, as necessary.



     D.        Normal Heating Degree Days (July-June)



     E.        Normal Cooling Degree Days (January-December)



               Degree day data are used to estimate amounts

               of energy required to maintain comfortable

               indoor temperature levels. Daily values are

               computed from each days mean temperature (max

               + min/2).  Each degree that a day's mean

               temperature is below or above 65 degrees

               Fahrenheit is counted as one heating or

               cooling degree day.



     F.        Normal Precipitation, Inches



               The normal precipitation is the arithmetic

               mean for each month over the 30-year period,

               adjusted as necessary, and includes the liquid

               water equivalent of snowfall.
