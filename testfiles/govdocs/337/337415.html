<h2 id="Disclosure avoidance procedures">Disclosure&ndash;avoidance procedures</h2>

<P class=ind>Like other statistical agencies, the Bureau of Economic
Analysis (BEA) is legally required to safeguard the
confidentiality of the information that it receives. In addition,
like other agencies, it must balance its responsibility to avoid
disclosing confidential information with its responsibility to
release and to publish as much information as possible. It
balances these responsibilities by presenting the estimates for
regions, states, and local areas only at the Standard Industrial
Classification (SIC) two&ndash;digit level, even though it receives
source data at the SIC three&ndash; and four&ndash;digit levels.</P>

<P class=ind>Most of the data series that BEA receives from other
agencies are not confidential. The agencies summarize these data
to aggregate totals by program and by state or county, so that
each record, or data cell, contains data for enough individuals
or establishments to preclude the identification of the data for
a specific individual or establishment and, therefore, to
preclude the disclosure of confidential information.<a href="#footnotes"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A>

<P class=ind>However, the ES&ndash;202 tabulations that BEA receives from the
Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) include records that would
disclose confidential information. The confidential information
on wages and salaries for some business firms is identifiable
from the state and county estimates of wages and salaries that
are derived from the ES&ndash;202 data.<a href="#footnotes"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A></P>

<P class=ind>To prevent either the direct or the indirect disclosure of
the confidential information, BEA uses the BLS state and county
nondisclosure file.</P>

<P class=ind>BEA uses as many BLS nondisclosure cells as possible, but
cannot use some of them for various reasons.  The most important
reasons are that the industry structure published by BEA does not
exactly match the detail provided by BLS and that BEA does not
use ES&ndash;202 data for the farm sector.  When BEA drops BLS
nondisclosure cells, other cells must be selected to prevent the
disclosure of confidential information.  In order to determine
which estimates should be suppressed, the total wages and
salaries file and the wages&ndash;and&ndash;salaries&ndash;nondisclosure file are
used to prepare a multidimensional matrix. This matrix is tested,
and the estimates that should be suppressed are selected.<a href="#footnotes"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A></P>


<h2 id="Dual Allocation">Dual Allocation</h2>

<P class=ind>The dual allocation procedure is used to allocate a data
series by state and by industry simultaneously to a set of
national control totals for the industries and to a set of
all&ndash;industry control totals for the states. It is also used in
the estimation of quarterly state personal income to allocate a
quarterly data series by state simultaneously to national control
totals by quarter and to state annual control totals. </P>

<P class=ind>In a dual allocation, the two sets of control totals are
placed in a matrix, with the national control totals as the
column totals and the state control totals as the row totals. The
allocating series is placed in the same matrix to serve as the
set of elements. These elements are adjusted alternately by
allocation to sum first to the column totals and then to the row
totals; the procedure is completed by an allocation of the column
totals. </P>

<h2 id="Employment">Employment</h2>

<P class=ind>The BEA employment series for states and local areas
comprises estimates of the number of jobs, full&ndash;time plus part
time, by place of work. Full&ndash;time and part&ndash;time jobs are counted
at equal weight. Both employment for wages and salaries and
proprietors' employment are included, but the employment of
unpaid family workers and volunteers is not included.
Proprietors' employment consists of the number of sole
proprietorships and the number of partners in partnerships. The
description "by place of work" applies to the wage and salary
portion of the series and, with relatively little error, to the
entire series. The proprietors' employment portion of the series,
however, is more nearly by place of residence because, for
nonfarm sole proprietorships, the estimates are based on IRS tax
data that reflect the address from which the proprietor's
individual tax return is filed, which is usually the proprietor's
residence. The nonfarm partnership portion of the proprietors'
employment series reflects the tax&ndash;filing address of the
partnership, which may be either the residence of one of the
partners or the business address of the partnership.</P>

<P class=ind>The employment estimates are designed to be consistent with
the estimates of wage and salary disbursements and proprietors'
income that are part of the personal income series. The
employment estimates are based on the same sets of source data as
the corresponding earnings estimates and are prepared with
parallel methodologies. Two forms of proprietors' income&#8211;the
income of limited partnerships and the income of tax&ndash;exempt
cooperatives&#8211;have no corresponding employment estimates. </P>


<h2 id="Imputation">Imputation</h2>

<P class=ind>Imputations are added to personal income and to other
measures in the national income and product accounts (NIPA's) so
that a comprehensive account of total production and its
distribution can be presented. The imputed transactions included
in the NIPA's are a limited set of exceptions to the principle
that the NIPA's reflect market transactions in goods and
services. In order to keep the NIPA measures invariant to how
certain activities are carried out, imputations are made to place
a market value on certain transactions that do not occur or are
not observable in the market economy. In addition, some market
transactions are reconstructed to provide a representation of the
activity that is more appropriate for the NIPA's. Both a measure
of the production and the incomes associated with that production
are imputed.  The imputations described here are those that
affect personal income.<a href="#footnotes"><SUP>(4)</SUP></A> </P>

<P class=ind>Specifically, six imputations are included in the estimates
of personal income: Imputed pay&ndash;in&ndash;kind, employer&ndash;paid health and
life insurance premiums, the net rental value of owner&ndash;occupied
farm housing and the value of food and fuel produced and consumed
on farms, the net rental value of owner&ndash;occupied nonfarm housing,
the net margins on owner&ndash;built housing, and the imputed interest
paid by financial intermediaries except life insurance carriers.
These imputations accounted for about 8 percent of personal
income at the national level in 2001.</P>

<P class=ind>Imputed pay&ndash;in&ndash;kind, is added to the estimates of wages and
salaries so that all the earnings of employees who receive part
of their wages in pay&ndash;in&ndash;kind will be included in personal
income. This imputation is an estimate of the value of the food,
lodging, clothing, and other goods and services that are received
by employees from their employers as full payment or as partial
payment for their services.</P>

<P class=ind>The net rental value of owner&ndash;occupied farm housing and the
value of food and fuel produced and consumed on farms are
included in farm proprietors' income so that that measure
reflects the income from all of the production of noncorporate
farms. </P>

<P class=ind>The net rental value of owner&ndash;occupied nonfarm housing is
included in the rental income of persons. The imputation assumes
that the owner&ndash;occupants are in the rental business and that they
are renting the houses in which they live to themselves: As
tenants, they pay rent to the landlords (that is, to themselves);
as landlords, they collect rent from their tenants (that is, from
themselves), they incur expenses, and they may have a profit or a
loss from the rental business.</P>

<P class=ind>The net margin on owner&ndash;built housing is included in
proprietors' income, classified in the construction industry.  It
is the imputed net income of individuals from the management of
the construction or renovation of their own dwellings and is
included in the measure of the output of structures.   </P>

<P class=ind>The imputed interest income paid by financial intermediaries
except life insurance carriers, which is included in personal
interest income, is received by persons from depository
institutions, that is, from commercial banks, mutual savings
banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, and
regulated investment companies. It is an estimate of the value of
the services (such as checking and record keeping) that these
institutions provide to persons without an explicit charge.</P>

<P class=ind>Another portion of personal interest income is classified as
imputed interest. This is an estimate of the investment income
that is earned on the financial reserves of life insurance
carriers. This investment income is attributed to the
policyholders in order to include it in personal saving, and not
in business saving, and when the income is earned, rather than
when it is distributed.</P>


<h2 id="Industry Classification">Industry classification</h2>

<P class=ind>For the private sector for the years through 2001, the
Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) provided by the Office
of Management and Budget is used for the classification of the
estimates of wage and salary disbursements, other labor income,
and proprietors' income by establishment industry. The Standard
Industrial Classification Manual, 1967 is used for the
classification of the estimates for 1969&ndash;74, and the 1972 Manual
is used for the classification of the estimates for 1975&ndash;87, and
the 1987 Manual is used for the classification of the estimates
for 1988&ndash;2001.<a href="#footnotes"><SUP>(5)</SUP></A></P>

<P class=ind>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is
used for the classification of the estimates for 2001.<a href="#footnotes"><SUP>(6)</SUP></A></P>

<P class=ind>For the public sector, the estimates of wages and salaries
and other labor income are classified by level of government&#8211;Federal, state, and local. The estimates for the Federal
government are subclassified into civilian and military. </P>


<h2 id="Interpolation">Interpolation and extrapolation</h2>

<P class=ind>Interpolation and extrapolation are used to prepare the
first approximations of the state estimates of some of the
components of personal income for the years in which direct
source data are unavailable. Both procedures use the data for
these components for benchmark years&#8211;the years for which the
best data are available&#8211;and both frequently use other data that
are related to the benchmark&ndash;year data for the components.</P>

<P class=ind>Interpolation is used to derive the first approximation of
the estimates for years that are between benchmark years. For
example, if data for wages and salaries for an industry were
available only from the decennial censuses of population but
employment data were available annually from another source, the
first approximations of wages and salaries for 1981&ndash;89 are
interpolated from the state data for wages and salaries 1980 and
for 1990, the two census benchmark years, and from the data for
employment for 1980&ndash;90.</P>

<P class=ind>Extrapolation is used to derive the first approximations for
the years that are beyond the most recent benchmark year. For
example, the first approximations of wages for 1991&ndash;99 might be
extrapolated from the census benchmark data for 1990 and from the
employment data for 1990&ndash;99. The estimates based on extrapolation
are usually superseded by revised estimates when benchmark data
become available for a more current year. For the preceding
example, the estimates for 1991&ndash;99 would be superseded by
estimates based on interpolation when census benchmark data
became available for 2000. </P>

<P class=ind>Both interpolation and extrapolation are illustrated in the
following examples. In the first two examples, interpolation is
used to derive the first approximations of wages and salaries for
an industry in states A, B, and C for the years 2 and 3 that are
between the benchmark years 1 and 4. In the third example,
extrapolation is used to derive the approximations for year 5.</P>

<P class=ind>In the first example, "straight&ndash;line interpolation" is used
to derive the first approximations for years 2 and 3 from the
state data for the benchmark years 1 and 4.<a href="#footnotes"><SUP>(7)</SUP></A> The first
approximations for year 2 equals the amount for year 1 plus
one&ndash;third of the increase from year 1 to year 4; the preliminary
estimate for year 3 equals the amount for year 1 plus two&ndash;thirds
of the increase.</P>

<P class=ind>In the second example, interpolation with a related series
of data, the indicator series, is used to derive the first
approximations for years 2 and 3 from the benchmark data for
years 1 and 4 and from the indicator series for all four years.
The data for wages and salaries are the benchmark data, the
employment data are the indicator series, and the average wages
(computed as wages and salaries divided by employment) are the
interpolation ratios.<a href="#footnotes"><SUP>(8)</SUP></A> This method of interpolation is
illustrated in three steps. </P>

<P class=ind>First, the average wages of the employees in an industry for
years 1 and 4 are calculated from data for wages and salaries and
data for employment for those years. The wages for each year are
divided by the number of employees for the year to yield the
average wages of the employees.</P>

<P class=ind>After interpolation or extrapolation is used to calculate the
first approximations of a component of state personal income, the
approximations are adjusted by allocation to sum to the national
estimate of the component. </P>


<h2 id="PCPI">Per capita personal income</h2>

<P class=ind>This measure of income is calculated as the personal income
of the residents of a given area divided by the resident
population of the area. In computing per capita personal income
for states and counties, BEA uses the Census Bureau's annual
midyear population estimates. Except for the college student and
other seasonal populations, which are measured on April 1, the
population for all years is estimated on July 1.</P>


<h2 id="TPI">Personal income, adjusted gross income, and money income</h2>

<P class=ind>The measure of personal income that is prepared by BEA
differs substantially from adjusted gross income (AGI), which is
the principal measure of the income of individuals that is
tabulated by the Internal Revenue Service. Personal income also
differs from money income, which is prepared by the Census
Bureau.</P>

<P class=ind>As compared with AGI, personal income consists of the income
of nonprofit institutions serving individuals, private noninsured
welfare funds, and private trust funds as well as of individuals,
whereas AGI consists only of the income of individuals who file
individual income tax returns. Personal income also includes
employer contributions to private health and pension funds and to
government employee retirement plans, several types of imputed
incomes, transfer payments, and all of the interest received by
individuals, whereas AGI excludes all employer contributions,
imputed incomes, most transfer payments, and the nontaxable
interest received by individuals. Personal income, unlike AGI,
excludes personal contributions for social insurance, realized
capital gains and losses, and pensions and annuities from private
and government employee retirement plans.<A HREF="#N_10_"><SUP>(10)</SUP></A></P>

<P class=ind>Personal income differs from money income mainly because
money income consists only of the income that is received by
individuals in cash and its equivalents. Personal income, unlike
money income, includes imputed income, lump&ndash;sum payments not
received as part of earnings, certain in&ndash;kind transfer payments&#8211;such as medicaid, medicare, and food stamps&#8211;and employer
contributions to private health and pension funds and to
government employee retirement plans. Personal income, unlike

transfers, such as child support. </P>

<P class=ind>The state personal income measure for a year includes the
income received by individuals living in the state during the
year. The state money income measure for a year consists of the
income received during the year by the individuals living in the
state on April 1 of the following year, regardless of where they
were living when they received the income. The income received by
individuals who died or moved abroad before April 1 of the
following year is not included in the money income measure of any
state. </P>

<P class=ind>Personal income for states is prepared quarterly and for
counties is prepared annually, whereas money income for states,
counties, and cities is prepared decennially from the data from
the "long&ndash;form" sample conducted as part of the census of
population.<A HREF="#N_11_"><SUP>(11)</SUP></A></P>

<P>7.    Straight&ndash;line interpolation assumes that the magnitude of the
annual change is the same in each year in the interpolated time
series, subject to modification by the adjustment to the national
control totals. Straight&ndash;line interpolation is used as the default
option, when no annual source data related to the income series are
available.
<P>8.    Using an indicator series for interpolation between 2
benchmark years assumes that any change in the relationship between
the data for the income component for the benchmark years and the
data from the indicator series for the benchmark years occurs
uniformly over time. This relationship is embodied in the
interpolation ratios, which in this example are the average wages. </P>

<P class=ind>For this procedure, straight&ndash;line interpolation of the
benchmark&ndash;year interpolation ratios is used to calculate the ratios
for the intervening years. A benchmark&ndash;year interpolation ratio is
the ratio of the datum for an income component for the benchmark
year to the datum for the same year from the annual indicator
series. The interpolation ratios for the intervening years are
multiplied by the data for those years from the indicator series to
yield the interpolated series for those years.
<P>9.    Using an indicator series for extrapolation assumes that the
relationship between the data for the income component for the
latest benchmark year and the data from the indicator series for
that year remains unchanged in the subsequent years.
