<P ALIGN="justify">ON May 30, by a vote of six (Delaware, Massachusetts,
North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Virginia) to one
(Connecticut), with New York divided, the delegates resolved to proceed
toward the establishment of a <I>"national</I> Government . . .
consisting of a <I>supreme</I> Legislative, Executive,
&amp; Judiciary." Randolph had suggested this wording as a substitute
for the first resolution of the Virginia Plan, which had stressed
amendment of the Articles of Confederation. This action in effect
represented a commitment almost from the beginning to scrap the Articles
and focus attention on a totally new frame and form of government. Over
the next 2 weeks, the committee of the whole debated the implications of
this resolution and the various provisions of the Virginia Plan. Many
disagreements arose over various points, but the deepest and most
persistent was over the matter of representation in the proposed
legislature. For obvious reasons, most of the delegates of States with
large populations or wealth or those such as Georgia with sizable areas
that might be expected to be populous in the future favored
representation based upon those factors.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">But many ardent nationalists from the small
States&#151;Paterson of New Jersey and Sherman of Connecticut for
example&#151;resented the loss of equal power they enjoyed under the
Articles of Confederation and feared they would be dominated or even
swallowed up by the large States. Some of these men felt their
credentials did not authorize them to support such a proposal or that
their States would not approve such an action. This group insisted that
representation in at least one house should be by State as it was in the
Continental Congress. At first, it appeared that the large States would
prevail, but by mid-June it had become clear that the small ones would
not budge and that some form of compromise was imperative.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">On Wednesday, June 13, the initial debate ended, and
the committee reported out 19 resolutions. The Virginia Plan had
undergone some modifications. Madison's treasured "council of revision"
had been thrown out. So had the authority of the national government to
use force against intractable States. A 3-year term was specified for
the lower house, and a 7-year term for the upper. The minimum age for
both was 30. The central government, instead of the States, was to pay
members of the two houses&#151;an important step in making Congress
responsible to the national rather than to the State governments. The
executive, now defined as one person, was to be elected by the national
legislature for a single 7-year term. To balance the executive's
dependence upon the legislature, he was given the power to veto
legislative acts unless overridden by two-thirds of both houses.
Finally, the upper house would choose a "supreme Tribunal" of judges.
Most other provisions were virtually identical with the original
Virginia Plan.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">A key element of that plan retained in the committee
report was the principle of variable representation based upon the
relative population and/or wealth of the States. Determination of the
ratios involved was to be a major point in the continuing debate.
Despite serious disagreements remaining among the delegates, it became
clear that most of them sought a national government and that an
increasing number favored granting some form of sovereignty to the
people at large as well as the States. This contradicted classical
political theory, which held that sovereignty could have only a single
source and the body politic a single head.</P>

</TABLE>


<P ALIGN="justify"><BR>IN mid-June, however, the sovereignty issue still
needed to be settled. Several features of the revised Virginia Plan
continued to alienate small-State delegates. They countered with their
own plan. On June 14 Paterson asked for a day's delay so that he might
submit a "purely federal" scheme as an alternative to the Virginia Plan.
The fruit of his labor and that of Sherman and others was the New
Jersey, or Paterson, Plan, introduced on June 15.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">This proposal consisted of a set of nine resolutions
designed to revise and strengthen the Articles of Confederation without
abandoning them or changing their character as a league of States
focused around the Continental Congress&#151;all many of the delegates
felt they were authorized to do. New and expanded powers were proposed
for Congress, in which each State was still to hold one vote. Included
were the raising of revenue through import duties, stamp taxes, and
postage; power to regulate commerce among the States and with foreign
nations; authority to force the States, when approved by an unspecified
number of them, to support the government financially and militarily;
and the right to use armed force to compel obedience to federal law by
individuals as well as States.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Dividing the federal authority into legislative,
executive, and judicial branches like the Virginia Plan, the New Jersey
Plan proposed a plural executive, elected by Congress for a single term
and subject to removal by a majority of the State executives. The
executive would have authority to appoint a supreme court.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The New Jersey Plan was surely less radical than the
nationalistic Virginia Plan, but it was not "purely federal." The sixth
resolution clearly established the primacy of congressional acts and
treaties&#151;a provision hardly in keeping with the notion of a
voluntary compact of 13 separate but equal States.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">On June 16 and 19 the committee of the whole debated
the New Jersey Plan. Arguing in its favor, Lansing of New York and
Paterson of New Jersey asserted that the Virginia Plan must be rejected
because the delegates lacked authority to create a government not based
upon the existing Confederation and because the States and people would
never approve such a plan. Wilson of Pennsylvania replied that the
Convention was authorized to propose whatever it chose. South Carolina's
Charles Pinckney tartly observed that if national representation were
made equal by States, New Jersey would readily assent to the Virginia
Plan. Randolph of Virginia claimed the national crisis was severe enough
to warrant a departure from the Confederation system.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">At this point, on June 18, Hamilton of New York, who
attended irregularly, gave one of his rare speeches&#151;a long one.
"Continental" in nature and monarchical in spirit, the supreme central
government he proposed would make all the laws and appoint all State
executives. The president would be responsible for executing laws
enacted by the legislature and would enjoy veto power over their
passage, as well as extensive appointment and treaty-making powers.
Although the members of the lower house would be elected to 3-year terms
by popular vote, the upper as well as the president would be chosen
indirectly by electors and would hold office for life during good
behavior. Not only would the power of the States be quashed, but also
governmental control would be placed in the hands of the wealthy and
participation of the populace at large minimized. The plan was clearly
unacceptable to the majority of the delegates and they ignored it.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Part of the reason for Hamilton's surprisingly small
role in the debates was his extreme nationalism, which put him out of
step with his fellows. Another factor was undoubtedly the frustrating
effect of his minority position vis-a-vis the two other New York
delegates, Lansing and Yates, who usually outvoted him to cast the
State's vote. For this reason, until they departed on July 10, he spent
some time at home in New York City attending to his law practice; after
they left, he had little more reason to participate because, as the sole
delegate present from his State, he could not cast its vote.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The day after Hamilton presented his plan, the
delegates finished discussion of the New Jersey Plan. Madison made an
extended address on the weakness of the proposal and sought to appeal to
the self-interest of the small States in forming a strong union. Then,
by a vote of seven States (Connecticut, Georgia, Massachusetts, North
Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Virginia) to three
(Delaware, New Jersey, and New York), with Maryland divided, the framers
accepted the Virginia Plan. It was clear, however, that the idea of
proportional representation in both houses was continuing to be strongly
opposed. The Convention adjourned the committee of the whole and went
back into regular session to consider the resolutions that had been
passed during the preceding weeks.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">During the period June 20-27, when the resolutions on
the amended Virginia Plan began to be considered, the debates touched on
a variety of subjects: the nature of representation, corruption of
legislatures, and the purposes and functions of the upper and lower
houses. The nationalists yielded on certain minor points. Several
compromises were struck. Madison, Randolph, and others in their camp
agreed to drop the word "national" from the committee's first and third
resolutions. That word had offended many.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Other changes included the approval of a 6-year term
for members of the upper house, one-third of whom were to be elected
every 2 years. Because this provision made no mention of the source of
legislators' pay, it retreated from the controversial stipulation in the
resolution that they were to be paid out of the national treasury.
Agreement was also reached that members of the legislature would not be
simultaneously eligible for State and National offices.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify"><BR>BY this time, despite such temporary harmony, feeling
had grown so intense on the issue of representation that the Convention
seemed on the brink of dissolution. Some members began to talk about
going home, but fortunately most were not willing to abandon hope of
compromise. In a long and bitter speech on June 27-28, Luther Martin, a
late arrival from Maryland who consistently opposed majority programs,
took the floor and denounced Virginia, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania
for seeking to control the other States. He upheld the principle of one
vote for each State. In a forceful rebuttal, Madison stated that these
three large States had not made common cause against the others under
the Confederation. What the small States really had to fear, he
insisted, was a continuation of the existing system, where they were
really at the mercy of their large-State neighbors.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Franklin, apparently believing that passions needed
to be cooled, proposed that the daily sessions be opened with prayers
offered by a local clergyman. Sherman seconded the motion, but Hamilton
opposed it. The latter feared the presence of a minister might cause the
public to believe the Convention was torn with dissension. Others argued
that reason&#151;not heavenly help&#151;was what was needed. In any
case, Franklin's proposal died after Williamson raised the embarrassing
question of where the money would be obtained to pay the clergyman.</P>


<P ALIGN="justify"><BR>AT this point, bitter debate began. It would last
until mid-July. The subject was still representation in the national
legislature. The result was the "Great" or "Connecticut" Compromise. The
prolonged contention arose largely from the central position of the
legislature in the proposed new scheme of government. Under the Virginia
Plan, as revised, which the Convention had accepted, the legislature
would be virtually supreme. Not only would it elect the executive and
the judiciary and have authority to annul all State laws, but also its
overall authority in national affairs was extremely broad.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">On June 29 the Convention voted six (Georgia,
Massachusetts, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and
Virginia) to four (Connecticut, Delaware, New Jersey, and New York),
with Maryland divided, to base representation in the lower house upon
some system different from that used in the Confederation; this was
almost precisely the same vote as on the same issue in the committee of
the whole nearly 3 weeks earlier. Succeeding days brought continued
discussion of the question of representation&#151;but in the upper
house. Franklin even made a complicated proposal for variable voting
depending on the type of legislation.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">On July 2 a deadlock occurred on a vote to allow each
State an equal voice in the upper house. Five States (Connecticut,
Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, and New York) were in favor and five
(Massachusetts, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and
Virginia) were opposed; Georgia was divided. This key vote was
determined partially by chance because one Maryland delegate was absent,
which permitted Martin to cast the State's vote; and Baldwin changed his
stand and divided Georgia's vote. The issue between the large and small
States was joined. To break the impasse, a committee of one member from
each of the 11 States present was appointed.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The main body adjourned on July 3-4 to celebrate
independence and to allow time for the committee to deliberate. It
consisted of Gerry of Massachusetts, Sherman of Connecticut (sitting in
for Ellsworth), Yates of New York, Paterson of New Jersey, Franklin of
Pennsylvania, Bedford of Delaware, Luther Martin of Maryland, Mason of
Virginia, Davie of North Carolina, Rutledge of South Carolina, and
Baldwin of Georgia.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The membership was notably weak in nationalists of
the Madison and Wilson stripe, both of whom opposed establishment of the
committee, and strong in States-rights men and moderate nationalists.
The basic idea of a compromise had been suggested as early as June 2 by
Dickinson, and reiterated later by several others, notably Sherman and
Ellsworth. Thus, the decision of the committee came as no surprise. On
July 5 Gerry brought in the report. It based representation in the lower
house on the free population and three-fifths of the slaves; and in the
upper by State. In neither case was an exact total specified, nor was
distribution made by State in the lower house. As a concession to the
large States, it was further proposed that the lower house should
possess exclusive power to initiate money bills without changes or
amendments by the upper house. In the lower, every 40,000 inhabitants
were to be represented by one member; States having less population were
each guaranteed one.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">This compromise solution still did not please most of
the delegates, many of whom remained angry over the bitter debates that
had preceded appointment of the committee. Its recommendations, however,
provided a basis for action and steered the Convention away from
complete deadlock. On July 6 the portion of the committee report giving
special powers to the lower house was approved.</P>

</TABLE>

<P ALIGN="justify">That same day, another committee, dominated by
large-State nationalists and made up of Gorham and King of
Massachusetts, Randolph of Virginia, Rutledge of South Carolina, and
Gouverneur Morris of Pennsylvania, was created to iron out the numerical
formula for State representation in the proposed lower house. The next
day, the Convention approved equality of votes in the upper. Two days
later, on July 9, Morris presented the committee's report. It
recommended that the first assembly of the lower house consist of 56
seats. These had been hastily and subjectively broken down among the 13
States (ranging from one to nine each), mainly on the basis of
population but also to some degree on wealth. Subsequently, the national
legislature was to vary apportionment of the seats based upon future
alterations in the same elements.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Yet an additional committee immediately came into
being to prepare a more satisfactory distribution of seats in the lower
house. The members were King, Sherman, Yates, Brearly, Gouverneur
Morris, Read, Carroll, Madison, Williamson, Rutledge, and Houstoun. The
next day, King delivered the report, which raised the number of seats to
65, an increase of one for most of the States. This undoubtedly was
attractive to the small ones. Efforts by Madison to double the number
and by Charles Cotesworth Pinckney to increase by one the seats for
North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia were both defeated. Finally,
the second committee's formula was approved.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The following day, July 11, was one of the most
contentious of the summer. Debate focused on the role of slaves in the
scheme of representation and the need for and mechanisms of a national
census; the latter subject had first arisen the day before. Slavery was
the second major controversial issue to arise during the representation
conflict and to be compromised. Unlike the large-small State clash,
which was to have but slight later impact, this one, which revealed not
only the different economic interests of the North and South but also
presented a moral dilemma, was to lead to disunion and civil war.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The crux of the problem was that most northern
sentiment favored the counting of slaves in deciding each State's share
of direct federal taxes, but not for representation. The bulk of the
Southern-State emissaries wanted to exclude slaves from that
computation, but desired to include them for the purpose of
representation in the lower house, though they had no intention of
permitting them to vote. Charles Cotesworth Pinckney and Butler of South
Carolina proposed that slaves be counted equally with freemen, but the
motion failed by a vote of seven States to three (Delaware, Georgia, and
South Carolina).</P>

</TABLE>

<P ALIGN="justify">New York was not registered on this or any subsequent
tallies during the Convention because the majority of its delegates,
Yates and Lansing, had headed home after the previous day's session.
Followers of States-rights advocate Gov. George Clinton and at odds with
their colleague, Hamilton, by this time they were probably sure that
ultimately the Convention would advocate a highly centralized type of
government. They also had pressing legal and judicial business in New
York. Apparently at the end of August they decided not to return to
Philadelphia. After they left, Hamilton's status was reduced to an
unofficial one, and only 10 States voted until July 23, when New
Hampshire's representatives finally arrived.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Later on July 11, six States to four voted in favor
of taking a census of free inhabitants to determine representation. By
the same numerical margin, a proposal was rejected to count three-fifths
of the slaves, a formula that the Continental Congress had frequently
utilized in making requisitions on the States and that had been
discussed earlier in the Convention. At the close of the session, the
resolution on the census was annulled and the decision was made to
adjourn. There was hope of progress on the morrow.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">That session began with a resolution by Gouverneur
Morris to correlate representation, based on wealth and population, with
taxation. After discussion and amendment to "direct" taxation, the
measure passed unanimously. A separate motion, as amended, provided that
a census was to be taken within 6 years of the adoption of the new
government and thereafter once every decade (decennially) to determine
the respective wealth and population of the States. As for the matter of
slaves, representation and taxation were both to be computed by counting
five of them as equal to three free inhabitants. A concession by the
Northern States, this assured southerners that all slaves would not be
taxed as such and that their region would also gain some
representational advantage. Some southern delegates once more tried to
amend the motion to count slaves equally with free inhabitants, but the
motion met defeat by a vote of eight States to two. A divisive issue had
been bridged and the way to the Great Compromise lay open.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The most significant action on Friday, July 13, was a
vote to eliminate wealth as a basis for representation in the lower
house of the national legislature. Wilson and Randolph brought nine
States with them in this tally, despite the vigorous protests of
Gouverneur Morris. Population was thus established as the sole criterion
for the apportionment of representation. When new States were admitted,
representation of the old would be adjusted at the time of the
succeeding census.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The next day, Saturday July 14, the large-State
nationalists again tried to improve their position. Charles Pinckney
proposed a specific apportionment scheme for the upper house, based
generally upon population. Despite the support of Wilson and Madison,
the resolution fell six States to four. The compromise was holding.</P>

</TABLE>

<P ALIGN="justify">On Monday, the 16th, the body reconvened to consider
the Great Compromise as a whole in its final form. The vote was close:
five States (Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, and North
Carolina) in favor, four (Georgia, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and
Virginia) opposed, and Massachusetts split.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">That night, July 16&#151;not convinced by the slim
5-4-1 vote of the need or the desirability of
surrender&#151;representatives of the large States met informally at the
Indian Queen Tavern to consider the situation. The next morning, before
the Convention proceedings resumed, they caucused formally. Had the
large States surrendered too much to the small? Should they continue to
attend the Convention? Should they continue to oppose the Great
Compromise? After much discussion, they could not agree. This
irresolution did not satisfy the diehards among them, but it cleared the
way for continuation of the business of writing the new constitution
because the large-State delegates no longer presented a united
front.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The most controversial issue was now essentially
resolved, but much remained to be done. Many details were still vague
and undefined. A document incorporating the decisions of the Convention
to that point still needed to be written. But the principal obstacle
sharply dividing men who agreed that the Articles of Confederation
needed a complete overhaul had been overcome. In the lower house of the
proposed national legislature, representation would be adjusted in
relation to population, as revealed by a decennial census, and
three-fifths of the slaves would be counted. In the upper house, each
State would enjoy equal representation.</P>

</TABLE>

<P ALIGN="justify">The Great Compromise, by correlating representation
with population in the lower house and providing for equality by State
in the upper, confirmed the existence of the States and gave Congress
both federal and national attributes. The fears of many small-State
delegates that the large States would control the Union, if not put
totally to rest, were measurably assuaged. On the whole, the compromise
was a victory for the small States, though on other matters their
delegates tended to follow the Virginia Plan, which provided for a
strong central government. Although Madison and other large-State
delegates had opposed the compromise right up to the last, they
recognized it was the price they had to pay for a consolidated Union.
The small States, by yielding on equal representation in the lower
house, had abandoned their hopes for a mere league of States like that
provided for by the Articles of Confederation. The large States, by
accepting equality of voting power in the Senate, signaled the end of
their attempts to dominate the government.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">On the other hand, from this point on the small
States, recognizing they would have a greater share of power in the
central government than their population or wealth warranted, were no
less desirous of strengthening the central government than the large
ones.</P>
