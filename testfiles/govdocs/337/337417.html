<p>Abstract: During the first seven months of 1994, the Southeastern United States was struck by a severe ice storm in February, followed by severe flooding in July. The ice storm resulted in over $3 billion in damage, while the flooding, caused by the remnants of Tropical Storm Alberto, resulted in up to $1 billion in damage. This report provides details and climatic data from these two events. </p><a href="#TOP"><img alt="Top of Page" src="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/top.gif"></a>

<p>Abstract: The United States was the host country for the 1994 World Cup Soccer tournament held between June 17 and July 17, 1994. The games were played at nine different sites across the country. One of the main concerns of tournament officials, athletes, fans and other participants was the expected weather during this period. The summer season is in full swing by the time mid-June rolls around -- hot and humid conditions are the norm for most of these sites, and weather can have a great impact. A few games were played in indoor or partially domed stadiums, but the majority of the games were outside. The report details the climatology of these host cities during June and July. The host cities were: Boston, Massachusetts Chicago,Illinois Dallas, Texas Detroit, Michigan East Rutherfordton, New Jersey Orlando, Florida Palo Alto, California Pasadena, California Washington, D.C.

<p>Abstract: The narrative portion of the report was derived from the Preliminary Hurricane Reports prepared by several research meteorologists at the National Hurricane Center, and the satellite imagery was provided by NCDC. The report provides a brief synopsis of each named tropical storm system in 1995 with one or more satellite images of each storm taken by the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) or the Polar Orbital Environmental Satellite (POES). The geographic area is the tropical storm basin of the North Atlantic Ocean, and adjacent land areas in the path of Atlantic tropical storms.</p><a href="#TOP"><img alt="Top of Page" src="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/top.gif"></a>

<p>Abstract: Geographic coverage is the north Atlantic Ocean tropical storm basin. Land areas include particularly the Caribbean islands and the eastern and southeastern United States. This report, produced by NCDC in cooperation with the Tropical Prediction Center (TPC), is a preliminary summary of the 1996 Atlantic Hurricane Season. The report provides a synopsis of each named tropical storm using textual information based on the TPC Preliminary Hurricane Reports authored by Avila, et al, and remotely sensed and in-situ data received at the NCDC. The satellite imagery for each storm was taken by the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) or the Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite (POES). Additional meteorological data for Hurricanes Bertha and Fran, the two most important hurricanes affecting the U.S. mainland, are also included. The graphical products include: NEXRAD Level III Base Velocity, Base Reflectivity and Storm Total Precipitation; GOES Water Vapor Movement Winds; and total precipitation from an extensive collection of cooperative and National Weather Service stations.</p><a href="#TOP"><img alt="Top of Page" src="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/top.gif"></a>

<p>Abstract: This annual report is a preliminary summary of the 1998 Atlantic Hurricane season. It provides a synopsis of each named tropical storm, using textual information obtained from the National Hurricane Center's Summary of the 1998 Atlantic Season report and the National Weather Service's Preliminary Storm Data reports. Selected satellite and doppler radar imagery were used for key times of each storm. The tables of station precipitation data were created from NWS cooperative and airport stations. The numbers for deaths and damages were obtained from several sources including the NHC Preliminary Hurricane Reports, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and state emergency management agencies. These numbers are subject to revision. The satellite images within this report along with many more tropical storm images are on-line under the satellite resources section at http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ol/satellite/olimages.html.</p><a href="#TOP"><img alt="Top of Page" src="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/top.gif"></a>

<p>Abstract: This report provides long-term climatological summaries and maps for tornadoes in the United States, with specific information concerning tornadoes during 1998-1999. The years 1998 and 1999 were quite active for tornadoes in the US, with well-above average numbers of fatalities. It is interesting to note that the winter-spring of 1998 was dominated by El Nino conditions, while the winter-spring of 1999 was dominated by La Nina, thus showing that active tornado seasons may occur in either situation. However, the 1998 season was much more active in the southeast, while 1999 saw a shift of activity farther west--very much as expected. Also, these 2 years produced a total of 3 tornadoes of F5 intensity and 11 tornadoes of F4 intensity, for a total of 14 in the violent F4-F5 category.</p><a href="#TOP"><img alt="Top of Page" src="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/top.gif"></a>

<p>Abstract: This study compares NEXRAD-estimated storm-total precipitation with rain-gauge measured total precipitation for five events: a. Missouri-Kansas in April 1994, Kansas City NEXRAD site. b. Southeast Texas in October 1994, Houston NEXRAD site. c. Florida in November 1994 (Hurricane Gordon), Melbourne NEXRAD site. d. Louisiana-Mississippi-Alabama in May 1995, Mobile and Slidell NEXRAD sites. e. South Carolina-North Carolina-Georgia in August 1995 (Tropical Storm Jerry), Columbia NEXRAD site. The hourly and daily precipitation data from NCDC were used to determine actual precipitation (ground truth) during the period in which the storm total precipitation estimates were determined by the NEXRAD Level III data. These hourly and daily precipitation amounts are taken from the National Weather Service and cooperative network of weather stations. Across the country, over 8000 of these cooperative stations generally record daily precipitation and maximum/minimum temperature data, with approximately 2500 sites reporting hourly precipitation amounts. </p><a href="#TOP"><img alt="Top of Page" src="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/top.gif"></a>

<p>Abstract: The barograph was an instrument that made a continuous pen and ink trace of the changing atmospheric pressure on a chart. The barograph chart is also called a barogram. There were also measurements made using other types of barometers, and recorded on paper forms. Pressures were in millibars or inches of mercury. Many of these barograms and forms were provided to NCDC by U.S. agencies: National Weather Service (NWS), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), U.S. Air Force Air Weather Service (AWS), and the U.S. Navy Weather Service. The archive includes barograms and forms from other sources, including merchant ships at sea. </p><a href="#TOP"><img alt="Top of Page" src="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/top.gif"></a>

<p>Abstract: A frost protected shallow foundation (FPSF) is a practical alternative to deeper, more-costly foundations in cold regions with seasonal ground freezing and the potential for frost heave. An FPSF incorporates strategically placed insulation to raise the frost depth around a building, thereby allowing foundation depths as shallow as 16 inches, even in the most severe climates. The most extensive use has been in the Nordic countries, where over one million FPSF homes have been constructed successfully over the last 40 years. The FPSF is considered standard practice for residential buildings in Scandinavia. The objective of this web page is to provide US builders, designers, code officials, and others with the air freezing index (AFI) data necessary to employ FPSF technology.</p><a href="#TOP"><img alt="Top of Page" src="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/top.gif"></a>

<p>Abstract: The Climatography of the United States No. 20 (CLIM20), Monthly Station Climate Summaries for 1971-2000 are station summaries of particular interest to agriculture, industry, and engineering applications. These summaries contain a variety of statistics for temperature, precipitation, snow, freeze dates, and degree day elements for more than 4,000 stations. The NCDC No. 20 series of climatic summaries gives weather data from selected observation sites in the National Weather Service (NWS) cooperative observation network. Those sites are usually in or near cities which do not have airport weather stations or city weather offices. There have been several issues of the No. 20 series; each issue is based on a specific period-of- record of observations. The latest issue is from the 1971-2000 period. Each issue is updated decennially. The major parameters in the No. 20 file for the 1971-2000 issue are monthly and annual temperature climatologies; monthly and annual precipitation climatologies; monthly and annual snow climatologies; freeze data; and degree days. </p><a href="#TOP"><img alt="Top of Page" src="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/top.gif"></a>

<p>Abstract: These operational forecasts began 4 hours after 00Z and 12Z observation times on a 1:40 million scale unless otherwise noted. The forecast levels were produced for 1000, 850, 700, 500, 300, 200, and 100 millibar levels. Most levels were forecast in 12 hour increments out to 48 hours. The 500 millibar was forecast out to 168 hours. The forecasts usually contain two or more of the following: All charts contain height contours - solid lines in decameters at 60 or 120 meter intervals. Temperature - dashed lines at intervals of 5 degrees Celsius. Wind - dashed lines at intervals of 20 knots. Thickness (derived from subtracting the height of a low level from a higher one) - dashed lines in decameters at 60-meter intervals.</p><a href="#TOP"><img alt="Top of Page" src="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/top.gif"></a>

<p>Abstract: GCOS was established in 1992 to ensure that the observations and information 
needed to address climate-related issues are obtained and made available to 
all potential users. It is co-sponsored by the World Meteorological 
Organization (WMO), the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of 
UNESCO, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the International 
Council for Science (ICSU). GCOS is intended to be a long-term, user-driven 
operational system capable of providing the comprehensive observations 
required for monitoring the climate system, for detecting and attributing 
climate change, for assessing the impacts of climate variability and change, 
and for supporting research toward improved understanding, modelling and 
prediction of the climate system. It addresses the total climate system 
including physical, chemical and biological properties, and atmospheric, 
oceanic, hydrologic, cryospheric and terrestrial processes.
Parameters included in the GCOS are mean daily temperature, daily maximum 
temperature, daily minimum temperature, mean daily station pressure, mean 
daily station pressure corrected to sea level, total daily daily 
precipitation, mean monthly temperature, mean monthly maximum temperature, 
mean monthly minimum temperature, mean monthly station pressure, mean 
monthly station pressure corrected to sea level, and total monthly

<p>Abstract: This consists of a combination of publications and data forms starting in 1960. Initially, high altitude meteorological data reports were presented in a limited publication by the U.S. Army Electronics Research and Development Activity titles Data Report of the Meteorological Rocket Firings. These reports began in April 1960 with the data for the fall 1959 and winter 1960. Publications continued by season through the summer 1962 data, then monthly from September 1962 through March 1964. NCDC began publishing these data on a monthly basis in January 1964 and continued through December 1968. Starting with January 1969 data, the NCDC publication title was changed to High Altitude Meteorological Data, to accommodate all types of high altitude meteorological observations. The publication format was also changed at that time and it continued to be issued monthly through December 1972. Quarterly issues began in 1973 and continued as a formal publication through the October-November- December 1976 issue. The data of the publication contains global wind, temperature, pressure, density, and speed of sound data from dropsondes carried aloft by rockets. Data were generally collected from 90 to 20 kilometers above the earths surface and are presented in tabular and graphic forms. A supplementary summary and a period of record comparative data table (means and standard deviations) are also included for each station month. Participating stations were widely scattered throughout the world. Although data starting with January 1977 were not published, they were compiled in the same format as the 1976 publication, placed on microform, and placed in digital data set DS-5850 (C00074). DS-5850 is a current digital data set at NCDC and is the recommended source for digital rocketsonde data. </p><a href="#TOP"><img alt="Top of Page" src="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/top.gif"></a>

<p>Abstract: The National Climatic Data Center (NCDC), in cooperation with the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Air Force, has developed an International Station Meteorological Climate Summary CD-ROM containing detailed climate summaries for 640 world wide stations and 5434 of the World Wide Airfield Summary Stations, DS-9647 (C00078) as 'fillers' in sparse regions. The data are accessible by panning and zooming to a given geographic area on a global display, or by directly selecting a station from one of seven identifiers, such as name, WMO id, or country. The data includes surface air temperature, humidity, winds, and precipitation. </p><a href="#TOP"><img alt="Top of Page" src="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/top.gif"></a>

<p>Abstract: During January and March of 1995, much of California was struck by extremely heavy precipitation, causing extensive property damage and loss of life. Estimates show over $3 billion in damages and 27 lives claimed by the flooding. The American Red Cross estimates that over 10,000 homes were damaged or destroyed. This report provides a brief review of the storms which caused the flooding, details of some of the damage, and precipitation statistics and maps for the events.

<p>Abstract: This report gives a climatological description of Lillehammer, Norway, with emphasis on winter conditions. Lillehammer is in a mountainous northern location with limited winter sunlight. Very similar to parts of the North American Pacific Northwest, Lillehammer winter weather is variable because of the very different western and eastern air masses that move over the area. Stormy weather blowing in from the west over the North Atlantic is the main weathermaker. As these storms move ashore at the Norwegian coast, temperatures are warmer than they would ordinarily be because of the influence of the Gulf Stream in the North Atlantic. Often there is coastal rain and mountain snow. At Lillehammer, the intervening mountains reduce both storminess and temperature. Winds are generally light, and light snowfall is frequent. There is a cold continental air mass that usually stays east of Norway. But occasionally this air mass moves west, and Lillehammer has episodes of bright sunlight and below-zero temperatures.</p><a href="#TOP"><img alt="Top of Page" src="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/top.gif"></a>

<p>Abstract: The publication provides narrative information about where and when tropical storms occur, their frequency of occurrence, and the general paths they follow. The narrative descriptions are supplemented with numerous charts, graphs, and diagrams. Also included are aerial, satellite, and surface photographs of tropical storms, and average sea conditions from 1/4-foot waves to greater than 37-foot waves associated with wind speeds from calm to 130 knots. The charts are presented in two sections: Storm Track and Frequency Maps, and Tropical Cyclone Roses. The Track Frequency Maps section provides charts by season, and/or by 10- to 30-day intervals, during the tropical storm season for the North Atlantic, Eastern North Pacific, Western North Pacific, Southeast Indian, Southwest Indian, and Southwest Pacific Ocean basins, and the Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal, and Indochina Oceanic areas. Each chart presents tracks preferred by tropical storms and their frequency along these tracks; and isopleths showing the scalar mean (average) speed in knots of storm movements based on 12 hour displacements. The Tropical Cyclone Roses section presents monthly and annual charts for various storm stages (tropical cyclone, tropical storm, hurricane, and tropical storm - hurricane combined) for the North Atlantic (including The Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico), Eastern North Pacific, Western North Pacific, Southwest Pacific and Australian area (including the Southeastern Indian Ocean), South Indian, and North Indian (including the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea) Ocean basins. The storm roses are presented for five degree latitude-longitude quadrangles. Each storm rose depicts statistics on the direction and speed of 12-hourly movements for tropical cyclone centers. The probability, in percent, of having at least one storm in any given year is also shown. </p><a href="#TOP"><img alt="Top of Page" src="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/top.gif"></a>

<p>Abstract: These computer plotted charts were prepared by the National Weather Service, and archived on 35-mm microfilm by the NCDC. The charts were prepared only for those days that snow cover exists, normally October through April. They were placed on one reel of microfilm each year for the years 1966 through 1980 and two reels of microfilm each year for 1981 and 1982. The data plotted on these charts were from the automatically processed data sets which had as their source the 1200 OMI Service C (3-hourly synoptic observations) and Service A (hourly aviation observations) of the National Weather Service Communications Network. The total snow depth and 6 hour increase of snow were plotted to the nearest whole inch, but trace amounts were also plotted. Total snow depth was plotted to the right of a blacked-in station circle. When there was snow in the last six hours, the amount was plotted centered on the station circle using white numbers on a black background. Additional reports, for which there is no space at the station location, were listed in a column along the right edge identified by station number, call letter, or name.</p><a href="#TOP"><img alt="Top of Page" src="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/top.gif"></a>

Dry bulb, wet bulb, and dew point temperatures (deg. F), c. Maximum and minimum temperatures for the previous 12 hours (deg. F), d. Relative humidity (%), e. Wind direction (8 points) and speed (mph), f. Maximum wind speed for the previous 12 hours (MPH), g. Precipitation amount (in.) for the previous 12 hours, h. Cloud amount (10 ths), kind, and direction of movement (from scale to 8 points), i. State of weather (plain language). 2. Daily observations of: a. maximum and minimum temperature (deg. F), b. Average temperature with departure from normal (deg. F), c. Precipitation amount with departure from normal (in.) and beginning and ending times, d. Snowfall and snow depth (in.), e. Average cloud amount (10 ths), f. Character of day (clear, partly cloudy, cloudy). 3. Monthly means and extremes of the parameters in 1 and 2. The twice daily observations were not taken at the same time each day by those stations, nor were they taken at the same time historically by each station. Times of observations vary from 05 am to 12 pm and from 12 pm to midnight local standard time. Some of the twice daily, daily, and monthly observations, averages and extremes, are also presented in the 'climatological record book' file. The 'Index of Original Surface Weather Records' lists those stations and the period of record for which the manuscript records in this file are available. They are listed under meteorological summary which indicates that some type of monthly summary is on file in the NCDC archives. A number of parameters are also presented hourly. Later in the period of record 6-hourly data is presented instead of 12 hourly.

<p>Abstract: These are in the WBAN 20 form types for pilot balloons (PIBAL). The sheets were prepared by the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Navy, the National Weather Service and its predecessor the Weather Bureau, and other U.S. organizations, for selected stations around the world. The sheets were done generally between 1946 and 1983, with a few at later dates. A WBAN 20 sheet recorded azimuth and elevation angles at one minute intervals during the balloon ascent. The height of the balloon above the surface and the distance the balloon had drifted from the observation point were determined and entered in the appropriate columns. The position of the balloon at each minute (determined by the azimuth angle and the distance from observation point) were plotted, and the wind direction and speed was then evaluated for each minute and for every even minute above 7 km., and entered on the sheet. Wind data were entered in the appropriate blocks. Maximum wind speed data were entered when speeds reached 45 meters per second (100 mph). Wind directions were coded to the nearest 5 deg., and wind speeds were coded in knots. </p><a href="#TOP"><img alt="Top of Page" src="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/top.gif"></a>

<p>Abstract: The primary source of these radar weather observations manuscript records are from approximately 110 National Weather Service (NWS) radar stations. The records were placed on microfiche monthly or annually, depending on the radar station. In addition, the years these records are available vary from station to station. There are also approximately 59 NWS radar observing stations equipped with weather surveillance radar which take photographs of the plan position indicator (PPI) scope on 16-mm or 35-mm film when echoes were visible, pictures were taken at least every 5 minutes and sometimes as often as every 40 seconds. When echoes were visible, pictures were taken at least every 5 minutes and sometimes as often as every 40 seconds. This dataset consist of hourly and special observations on daily MF 7-60 forms. Observations were taken about 35 minutes past the hour throughout each 24 hour period. Each observation provides detailed information about the character, type, and intensity of precipitation; direction and distance of the echoes from the station; movement of echoes; maximum height of cells; and pertinent remarks.</p><a href="#TOP"><img alt="Top of Page" src="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/top.gif"></a>

<p>Abstract: This data file contains standard surface meteorological observation taken aboard ships from 1796 to the present. While it covers the worldwide oceans, data collection varies widely at any one station and concentrates on shipping lanes. Parameters include temperature, pressure, visibility, wind speed and direction, sea state, cloud type, weather, and wave amplitude and direction. Marine surface weather observations for "fixed" Ocean Weather Stations are included in this file. The primary source of manuscript records in this file are form ships (commercial and military) operated by the United States. This file includes the Maury Collection. This collection has been digitally indexed and scanned. These records are abstract logs of ships that sailed during the period 1796-1861. Most of the material within these logs consists of abbreviated reports of meteorological observations made at sea and, in the case of the numerous abstracts submitted by whalers, abbreviated reports of whale sightings. Bound with the abstract logs in several of the volumes are some reports of land-based meteorological observations. The data from this file can also be found in NCDC's digital data setcatalog: Monthly Marine Observations, DS-1129 (C00242), NMC Global GTS Surface Marine, DS-6105 (C00220), and Marine Atlas Data, DS-9760 (C00091). </p><a href="#TOP"><img alt="Top of Page" src="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/top.gif"></a>

<p>Abstract: STAR was born from the work of Pasquill (1951), Turner (1964), and Martin and Tidvart (1968). It provides, at least roughly, the diffusion characteristics for the lowest part of the atmosphere and biosphere. It is an objective method of determining stability from readily available surface meteorological observations utilizing only the variables of ceiling height, total sky cover, and wind direction and speed as input. The methodology employed recognizes that stability near the ground is dependent primarily upon net radiation and wind speed. Wind direction is not a factor in objective determination of stability categories. Without the influence of clouds, insolation (incoming radiation) during the day is dependent mainly upon the solar elevation, which is a function of time of year, time of day, and station location. When clouds exist, their cover and thickness decrease incoming and outgoing radiation. In this system, insolation is estimated by solar elevation and modified for existing conditions of total sky cover and ceiling height. At night, estimates of outgoing radiation are again based on total sky cover and ceiling height. The STABILITY ARRAY consists of frequency and percent frequency tables of wind direction versus wind speed groups for each stability category. This system produces seven categories ranging from extremely unstable (A) to neutral (D) to extremely stable (G) and is summarized on a monthly, seasonal, and annual basis. </p><a href="#TOP"><img alt="Top of Page" src="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/top.gif"></a>

<p>Abstract: The geographic area is the eastern United States, especially the Atlantic coastal states; northeastern Mexico; Cuba; and southeastern Canada. This technical report, prepared by NCDC's Research Customer Service Group, describes the great U.S. winter storm of March 12-15, 1993. The 1993 storm has been called "The Storm of the Century", "The Blizzard of '93", or "The Big One!". The extratropical storm was characterized by hurricane-force winds, tornados, record snowfalls, record low temperatures, major social disruptions, property damage, and loss of life. To find similar U.S. winter storms in history, one has to look back to 1888 and then to 1717. This publication includes a brief summary of the blizzard, a comparison of this and the 1888 storm, and also observational data from various stations that were affected.</p><a href="#TOP"><img alt="Top of Page" src="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/top.gif"></a>

<p>Abstract: Ice thickness (and therefore weight) is a key engineering design consideration in the construction of many structures which are subject to outdoor weather, such as cables, towers, wires, etc. Detailed information for engineers regarding ice loads from freezing rain has been sorely lacking, due to a deficiency of site-specific data. Therefore, a consortium of individuals and government agencies undertook a project to produce a U.S. climatology of ice thickness due to freezing rain, in the form of an extreme value analysis. This 23-page report describes this effort, along with future plans for further development.</p><a href="#TOP"><img alt="Top of Page" src="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/top.gif"></a>

<p>Abstract: Prior to the winter of 1997-8, record-breaking warm-episode (El Nino) conditions had persisted in the tropical Pacific since June 1997. The winter of 1997-8 was marked by unusual extremes in parts of the country. The winter was dominated by an El Nino-influenced weather pattern, with wetter than normal conditions across much of the southern third of the country, and warmer than normal conditions across much of the northern two-thirds of the country. Overall, the winter (December 1997- February 1998) was the second warmest and seventh wettest since 1895. Severe weather events included flooding in the southeast and California, an ice storm in the northeast, and tornadoes in Florida.</p><a href="#TOP"><img alt="Top of Page" src="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/top.gif"></a>

<p>Abstract: This report provides a review of the winter of 1995-1996 in the United States--a winter of unusual extremes in parts of the country. Although December was not unusually active, January and February proved to be quite interesting. Those months included the following extreme events: The January blizzard and ensuing flooding in the Northeast, and then in February--a severe cold wave, Pacific Northwest flooding, and unusual warmth and fires in the southern plains. Another interesting aspect of this winter was the 'seesaw' pattern of temperatures and precipitation over much of the nation. Extremely cold conditions (such as early February) were often followed by unusual warmth. The same applied to precipitation, with the Northwest beginning the season on the dry side, and then moving into a very wet pattern. Therefore, as is sometimes the case in climatology, the averages of the season as a whole belie the extremes contained within.

<p>Abstract: The month of December 1996 and the first week of January 1997 brought tremendous amounts of rain and snow to parts of the states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, California, Nevada, and Montana. In particular, the period of December 26 through January 3 was especially severe with over 20 inches of rain in some locations. This, along with unusually warm temperatures which produced tremendous snow melt, resulted in record flooding in some areas. Emergency management officials in these states indicate that as many as half a million people were forced to evacuate at one time or another during December through early January.

<p>Abstract: In recognition of the International Year of the Ocean (YOTO), NCDC has produced a CD-ROM entitled "The Maury Collection, Global Ship Observations." YOTO commemorates Matthew Fontaine Maury, a 19th century U.S. Navy officer who did important pioneering studies of the world's oceans. The observations include air and sea temperatures, currents, pressure, cloud cover, present weather and wind direction/speed. The data were digitized from paper copies of hand written forms via the US-PRC Protocol on Cooperation in the Field of Marine and Fishery Science and Technology, by the Joint Coordination Panel for Data and Information Cooperation facilitated by NOAA and the government of China.

<p>Abstract: On March 12-14, 1993, the eastern seaboard of the U. S. was struck by what is now referred to as: 1) The Storm of the Century, 2) The Blizzard of 93, or 3) The Big One!. TR 93-01 describes this storm. One of the interesting and more overlooked aspects of the storm was the discrepancy between liquid water measurements by the rain gauge and water equivalent 'core samples' of the snow/ice on the ground. This report will attempt to show that: 1) The most likely scenario is a problem with 'undercatch' of snowfall, and 2) the careful measurement of water equivalent is an important element for hydrological interests and the climatic records.</p><a href="#TOP"><img alt="Top of Page" src="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/top.gif"></a>

Class 3 = ceiling less than 1,500 feet and/or visibility less than 3 miles, but ceiling equal to or greater than 400 feet and visibility equal to or greater than 1 mile. Class 4 = ceiling less than 400 feet and/or visibility less than 1 mile, but ceiling equal to or greater than 200 feet and visibility equal to or greater than 1/2 mile. Class 5 = ceiling less than 200 feet and/or visibility less than 1/2 mile, but ceiling equal to or greater than 100 feet and visibility equal to or greater than 1/4 mile. Class 6 = ceiling less than 100 feet and/or visibility less than 1/4 mile. Class 7 = all ceiling and visibility conditions, sums of Classes 1 and 2, also the sum of Classes 1 and 3 through 6.

<p>Abstract: An earlier publication called Index-Summarized Wind Data (M. Changery, W. T. Hedge, September 1977) was prepared as an aid in the identification of wind summaries filed in the NCDC archives. Wind Summary Index (N. P. McGuirk, June 1984) is an updated inventory of that earlier publication. The Wind Summary Index is a guide to the various types of wind summaries forthe U. S. and Puerto Rico filed in the NCDC archives prior to 1984. It does not present the actual summaries nor original wind data. It is alphabetical by state, and lists by station: 1) the type of wind summaries, 2) the periods of record summarized, 3) the frequency of the summaries (monthly, seasonal, annual, or combination thereof), and 4) the latitude, longitude, and elevation of the station during each period of record summarized. </p><a href="#TOP"><img alt="Top of Page" src="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/top.gif"></a>

<p>Abstract: These winds aloft charts (6-hourly or 12-hourly) were prepared by the National Meteorological Center now known as National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and archived on 35-mm microfilm by the NCDC. Data contains plotted stations wind direction (36 points) and speed (knots) as wind barbs. The altitude of the plotted winds varies, almost year to year. The charts were for 03 and 15 GMT (some years had additional 09 and 21 GMT) from March 1942 to May 1957. From June 1957 to present the charts were for 00, and 12 GMT (some years had additional 06 and 18 GMT data).</p><a href="#TOP"><img alt="Top of Page" src="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/top.gif"></a>

<p>Abstract: In December 1992 a period of wetness began in southern Arizona. Heavy precipitation inundated parts of Arizona in December; more than 400 percent of normal December precipitation fell in the southwestern part of the State. Heavy precipitation continued to fall during the next two months causing extensive flooding along the Gila River. This article summarizes the flood damage and the probabilities of observing the heavy rainfall.
