<P>DR. IEZZONI:  I think we're going to get started.   We're waiting for one
more subcommittee member, Hortensia  Amaro, but she will be here momentarily.</P>
<P>What I would do to parry just while we are waiting  for Hortensia is just go
around the room and have everybody  introduce him and herself, and tell us where
you are from.   So those of you who are coming to speak to us, can hear who  we
are, because we are about to hear from you guys.</P>
<P>[Introductions were made.]</P>
<P>I thank folks for coming to speak to us this  afternoon.  I had the pleasure
of chairing a presentation at  the biannual National Center for Health
Statistics meeting,  the data user's conference.  It was quite wonderful, but 
during this I learned something that I hadn't known before,  and that was that
our federal government has 45 different  definitions of disability.</P>
<P>Well, we are interested in learning about at least  four or possibly five
today.  This subcommittee does have an  interest in people with disabilities and
evaluating  functional status, and how people are basically living their  lives.</P>
<P>So Dr. Placek, I guess you are going to start off  by maybe giving a sense
of one of the major ways that people  think about classifying this, the ICIDH.</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  All right, thank you.  I am always  glad to have an opportunity
to do that.</P>
<P>I'm going to keep my presentation short -- say  about ten minutes -- because
that will give you some time to  really pick out what you really want to know
more about.   I'm going to really focus on three things:  revision  activities;
current applications, seven in fact; and give  you a feel for the new functional
status codes.</P>
<P>The North American Collaborating Center housed at  NCHS is working closely
with the Canadian Institute for  Health Information on the revision.  Of course
ICIDH was  published in 1980, and has been under revision since about  1992.  So
for the last five years I have been working at  least half-time or more on the
revision effort, and in some  cases on designing teaching tools on the old
ICIDH, because  it is still the only one we have, and will be for the next 
couple of years.</P>
<P>The most current revision title is up there, the  International
Classification of Impairments Activities,  which by the way, used to be
Disability, and Participation,  which used to be Handicapped.  So we have taken
out two  negative terms, et cetera, et cetera.  For short we call it  ICIDH-2,
since it is our current draft of the revision.</P>
<P>I'll give you a handout at the end which has all  of this overhead
information on it, but you can access  information about ICIDH and ICIDH-2 from
the from World  Health Organization Web, and you can also access the entire 
revision.  This is it, ICIDH-2.  If you would like your very  own copy, send me
an e-mail, give me your card today or  whatever, and I will be glad to send you
one.</P>
<P>I was actually planning to bring ten down, but as  I started to check
through them, either photocopying was out  of order, or the secretary got them
out of order.  I didn't  want to send a confused version out anywhere.  So I'll
get  those straight tomorrow, and send those out to you, or you  can download it
yourself.</P>
<P>The other thing you can download is all the  protocols for beta testing. 
All of it is up on the Web.</P>
<P>The NACC, the North American Collaborating Center,  has established two
North American testing centers to be  testing this version.  One is at
Washington University.   That is headed by Dr. David Gray.  The other is at the 
Canadian Institute for Health Information.  Linda Campbell  and Janice Miller
are working on that.</P>
<P>We are using World Health Organization protocols  to test this in four ways.
 The first is linguistic analysis  and translation from English into other
languages.  The  current version is in 16 languages.  We will have this 
probably in about a dozen languages by this December.   Canada is working with
the French on the French translation,  a Quebece(?) translation version of the
French.  Then the  U.S. is working on the Spanish with people at the Pan 
American Health Organization.</P>
<P>Then there are 12 basic questions, which sound  very short, but they are
short, but each question has five  parts, and they are very large questions. 
There is an item  evaluation of 50 items which are basically category  headings.
 There are subparts to those 50 questions.</P>
<P>Then finally, options testing of 14 alternatives  which have been proposed
by the different collaborating  centers.</P>
<P>So the protocols are every bit as thick as the  classification document
itself.  These WHO protocols are  being used everywhere in the world.  Everyone
is using the  same protocols -- the Turkish, the Dutch, in India, in  Japan, and
so on and so on.</P>
<P>The process is about a seven or eight year process  of revision, and we're
well through it.  We had initially  divided up the territory worldwide for which
collaborating  center would work on which part of the revision.  That has  been
done.  There was a literature review.  There was an  alpha draft.  There was a
testing of the alpha draft.</P>
<P>There was a production of the beta draft, and the  development of the beta
testing protocols for the beta  draft.  That's the fifth step.  So we are now
really just  starting the field trials using those protocols.  We are  testing
the beta draft.  Those tests will end in December of  this year.</P>
<P>Then WHO consultants and employees will take all  that information that they
have collected worldwide, and  produce another draft -- call it a beta-2 draft
-- in time  for the March 1998 WHO meeting in Tokyo, where we will have  yet a
much more refined beta-2 draft. Then in 1999, it will  go to the World Health
Assembly for approval.</P>
<P>The last NACC meeting was in St. Louis, Missouri.   It was attended by about
40 persons.  There were 36  recommendations.  In all, North America produced
about 200  pages of recommendations which went into making this up.   Obviously
not all the recommendations were followed, because  many of the recommendations
were in conflict with each  other.</P>
<P>There has been really quite a bit of togetherness  between the Canadians and
the U.S.  Representatives of both  countries attended the WHO meeting in April,
and they also  met here in the Washington area in July to go over the beta 
testing protocols.</P>
<P>The NACC is financially supporting beta testing  with small contracts to
Washington University and CIHI.   Another center in CDC, the National Center for
Environmental  Health is supporting several million dollars worth of  research
using ICIDH-2.  There is an allusion there to $2.5  million in U.S. research,
using three CDC grants.  I'll  refer to that later on another overhead.</P>
<P>The fourth annual NACC meeting will be in Ottawa  in a couple of months, and
the focus will be on where we are  in the beta testing.  It is primarily
attended by North  Americans, but other collaborative centers will be invited.  
The next WHO meeting is in March in Tokyo.</P>
<P>There are seven applications I'm going to talk  about today on ICIDH and
ICIDH-2.  This overhead only refers  to the old ICIDH, ICIDH 1980.  Just to give
you a feel for  what has been done with it really in the last year, two or 
three, RADIUS is the Research Archive on Disability in the  United States.  It
is a project funded by the National  Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research.
 It uses all of  the ICIDH classification headings for 16 major surveys.</P>
<P>Every variable in every survey, that is,  disability variable, has been
given an ICIDH heading  wherever it fell, so that one can retrieve information
from  the 16,000 variables in those 16 surveys according to an  ICIDH heading.</P>
<P>DR. MOR:  Excuse me, I don't understand how.   Could you just go through
that again?</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  Sure.</P>
<P>DR. IEZZONI:  At some point are you going to  describe to the committee what
is in ICIDH so people can  have a sense of what the content is?  Then maybe how
it  would be coded might become more clear.  Is that something  that you are
planning to do?</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  Sure, that will be my last overhead  in fact.</P>
<P>DR. IEZZONI:  Can we switch?</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  I'll tell you what.  Leave this up  for a second, and then I'll
get right back to it.  I want to  finish with ICIDH before we go to ICIDH-2.</P>
<P>So there are 37 major impairment, disability,  handicap categories which
collect around 12,000 numerical  codes for impairment, disability and handicap
in the current  ICIDH.  Those 37 headings are used to categorize all of the 
variables in all of the surveys in RADIUS.  It's just an  application of the
current -- we call it the old version,  but it is still in use, and will be for
a couple of years.</P>
<P>A second note, the United Nations Statistical  Division only uses ICIDH.  It
is the world standard for  classifying disability.  The three products that are
fairly  recent that I can highlight are DISTAT, which is a database.   They
basically employed the data from 55 nations and back  coded the disability data
to ICIDH codes.  Then they  compared countries for all those data items, so that
it is a  first attempt really in trying to compare different  countries.</P>
<P>Now the countries have used different  questionnaires to collect that
information, so comparability  is a bit of stretch.  At the same time, it does
make a point  that when you ask a question differently, you get different 
results.  We need to standardize our data collection  assessment instruments.</P>
<P>They also have a set of recommendations which they  have made to all
countries in the world regarding the  disability questions that they should use
in the future  population censuses.  They have also included table shells  to
show countries what the information should look like once  it is tabulated and
published.  So they are doing their best  to standardize disability information
in the world.  Then  they have a manual for the collection of such information. 
 It is a slick, published manual that sells for about $16.</P>
<P>I won't say anything about the last one, because  Gretchen Swanson reported
to you all in California.</P>
<P>The heart of the classification is often  considered to be the disability
section, now called  activities.  So ICIDH-2 has ten chapters.  The ten chapters
 are listed there, seeing, hearing, recognizing, and so on,  1-10.  Each
category also has a first qualifier, which is  level of difficulty, 0-9, and a
second qualifier, whether  personal or non-personal assistance is required. 
That is in  your handout.</P>
<P>Now go ahead and put the overhead on that has the  small print, that nobody
has a copy of.</P>
<P>I just picked out movement, Chapter 4.  This is  just the beginning of
movement.  I just picked it as an  illustration of an activity.  So you can see
how the coding  structure is.  A small (a) is for the term &quot;activity.&quot;
 In  the old ICIDH it would have been a (d) for disability.</P>
<P>Then the codes go 301, up into the high 300  numbers.  I don't like this
coding system, because in  Chapter 4 we have the codes that start with a 300,
but we  might fix that next time or we might not.  They did take  some of my
recommendations on this anyway.</P>
<P>You can see the level of detail of the coding.  So  a301, maintaining the
changing body position is defined as  including getting into a position and
staying in that  position for some time, as well as being able to change the 
position of a body as required.  Then to that you add the  first and second
qualifiers if you wish.</P>
<P>Bear in mind you can also collapse, since coding  is hierarchical.  So that
if you don't have very much  detail, you could just have a very short code which
says I3,  which would be an impairment in a movement area.  If you  have only
that gross level of information and no detail, you  can have a very short code.</P>
<P>DR. MOR:  Where did the &quot;I&quot; come from?</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  It's &quot;a.&quot;  I'm sorry, &quot;a.&quot;  So a3  would be
a movement disability.  A movement difficulty in  activity.</P>
<P>DR. AMARO:  Limitation?</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  Yes, the definition --</P>
<P>DR. MOR:  Then a301 would be specific --</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  It's a specific difficulty in a  movement activity.</P>
<P>DR. MOR:  Okay, then a301.20 would be something  about suddenly you have
difficulty standing on different  types of surfaces?</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  Right.</P>
<P>DR. MOR:  So a plush carpet versus a non-carpet or  trips on glossy surfaces
or those kinds of things, due to  movement, not due to visual acuity?</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  Right.  We don't have a &quot;due to&quot; yet  here.  What we
have is a difficulty in a movement activity,  and here is the difficulty, but
the cause of the difficulty  is most likely found in the impairment codes, where
we  identify an organ that doesn't work.</P>
<P>In this case, we would probably be looking at --  well, we could be looking
at anything, but we might be  looking at a leg or a foot problem, or it might be
looking  at a balance problem.  If it would be an &quot;i&quot; code or an 
impairment code, that would probably lead you to understand  why the person has
difficulty in this activity.</P>
<P>DR. MOR:  So we have the &quot;a's&quot; first; those are  the activities. 
Then we have the &quot;i's&quot; which are  impairments, which are the causes? 
No?  I don't really  understand.  I apologize, because I don't know much about 
this.</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  You know what?  I think I have to  give the apology, because I
usually assume too much, that  people have so often heard this presentation.</P>
<P>DR. MOR:  I know very little at all.</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  I'll start with ICIDH, which is  International Classification
of Impairments.  An impairment  is an organ that doesn't work.  Disability is
something you  can or cannot do.  A handicap is a societal disadvantage you 
experience because of this disability.  So that's the  conceptual scheme.</P>
<P>DR. MOR:  The conceptual scheme I, at least, have  some familiarity with. 
What I don't know is how it actually  breaks down into coding.  How those three
sets of concepts  are interrelated in a coding structure.</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  They may or may not be interrelated.   There are no automatic
interrelationships.  Any given  impairment code may or may not result in any
given  disability code.  That may or may not result in a given  handicap code;
all of our usual and typical interrelationships.</P>
<P>DR. MOR:  Are there a whole series of impairment  codes that correspond to
each of these ten chapters?</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  It is a different set of impairment  codes, but they correspond
fairly closely.  In the old ICIDH  there about 700 impairment codes, about 600
disability  codes, about 100 handicap codes.  There are twice as many  codes in
the new ICIDH, especially a lot more codes in the  participation section, which
replaced the old handicap.   That is very much fleshed out.  So there are
probably 3,000  codes in the new ICIDH-2.</P>
<P>DR. MOR:  So what is a 301.30?  Is that a complete  ICIDH code?</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  Yes, that's a complete code.</P>
<P>MR. VAN AMBURG:  What does it mean?</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  If you have that code, it means you  have difficulty in that
area.</P>
<P>DR. MOR:  But it doesn't tell you what the  impairment is?</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  This doesn't tell you what the  impairment.</P>
<P>DR. MOR:  Where do you get what the impairment is?</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  One would have to do an assessment.   It could be a clinical
assessment or it could be done by a  questionnaire.</P>
<P>DR. MOR:  But is there a separate coding system  for that?</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  Yes, a whole other coding system for  that.</P>
<P>DR. MOR:  All right, so there are more numbers?</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  Lots more.</P>
<P>DR. IEZZONI:  There are 12,000 codes in ICIDH.</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  No, 1,200.</P>
<P>DR. IEZZONI:  How many are there in ICIDH-2?</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  Pretty close to 3,000.</P>
<P>DR. MOR:  So basically there are three separate  dimensions?</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  Yes.</P>
<P>DR. MOR:  There is an impairment set of codes,  about 300 and something.</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  Yes.</P>
<P>DR. MOR:  Then there is the activities.</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  Call it disability.</P>
<P>DR. MOR:  Then there is the handicapped or  participation.  There a whole
set of other codes.  They are  not necessarily grouped into these ten chapters?</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  No.</P>
<P>The ICIDH and ICIDH-2 can be viewed as if we take  ICIDH, which has
impairment, disability and handicap codes  as three separate sets of codes,
which are really  independent of one another, it's three separate 
classification systems under that title of ICIDH.</P>
<P>DR. MOR:  Can you just give us an example of a  potential impairment code
that might correspond to a 301.30?</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  Maintaining a seated position.  I'll  give it a shot.</P>
<P>DR. MOR:  What would be the impairment?</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  It's a little hard to find it in a  snap, but you can maybe --</P>
<P>DR. MOR:  Well, neurological.  Is there a  neurological impairment?</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  Oh, sure.</P>
<P>DR. MOR:  I've not seen these.  I know what the  diagnostic things might be;
I know what might have caused  them, but how is it classified.</P>
<P>DR. IEZZONI:  To what extent, Dr. Placek, do the  impairment codes
correspond to diagnoses that you would see  in ICD-9-CM for example?</P>
<P>DR. MOR:  That's better.</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  It's better, because I can handle it  a little better I think. 
The ICIDH-2 impairment codes are  similar in many ways to some of the ICD-10
codes, the  diagnostic codes, but they are not identical, and they do  not use
the same numbers.  They use similar groupings  though, similar chapter headings.</P>
<P>ICD-10 is a diagnosis or is a cause of death.   ICIDH-2 is an identification
of an organ system that does  not work, but doesn't identify why it doesn't
work.  So if  you were really going to do a really complete work up on an 
individual, then you would do an ICD-10-CM assessment to get  at the diagnosis. 
Then that would lead you very quickly to  which organ does or does not work and
ICIDH-2.</P>
<P>You would need further assessment to get at which  activity a person is or
is not capable of, which disability  it results in.  For that we would need what
I would call  assessment tools, which is structured questions on what you  can
or cannot do.</P>
<P>DR. IEZZONI:  Can I just ask also how much  information on psychiatric
disease and cognitive impairments  is included?</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  There is a terrific amount of  information on that.</P>
<P>DR. IEZZONI:  How does that interact with DSM-4?</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  Again, the coding systems are not  parallel or equal.  Bridges
can be built, but they have not  been built.</P>
<P>DR. IEZZONI:  Even though all this is being  shepherded by the WHO?</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  That's right.</P>
<P>MR. VAN AMBURG:  Can we go back to the first grade  here?  I'm looking at
this 301.20, maintaining a standing  position.  So this activity involves
staying in a standing  position for some time.  What does that mean?  How does
one  apply that?  If someone has that code, what does it mean?</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  It means you can't do that.</P>
<P>MR. VAN AMBURG:  What is &quot;some time.&quot;</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  There is a 0-9 level of difficulty.</P>
<P>DR. IEZZONI:  Would that correspond to minutes or  hours?</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  If you will put up the previous slide  that has the ten chapter
headings.</P>
<P>MR. VAN AMBURG:  Yes, I understand the difficulty  level, but how does one
apply that?  What is a five then?</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  Five would be moderate difficulty.  A  zero would be no
difficulty, and a nine is it's impossible  to do.</P>
<P>DR. IEZZONI:  Then I guess, George, what you're  asking, which I would ask
too, is what is &quot;some time?&quot;  I  can stand for two minutes, but I
can't stand for two hours.   So is there any definition of what you mean by &quot;some
time.&quot;</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  I see your question.  On that  particular code I don't have a
quick answer for you.  I'll  refer you all to personal and non-personal
assistance.</P>
<P>DR. AMARO:  Is there a standard definition of  those?  Of what the value
from 0-9 represents, so that  people across situations will be rating 5 for the
same?</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  Yes, there are short definitions for  what is 0, 1, 2, 3-9.</P>
<P>DR. IEZZONI:  It's more moderate, severe?</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  Yes, of that sort.</P>
<P>DR. IEZZONI:  So it's not specific --</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  In duration of minutes, it is not.</P>
<P>MR. VAN AMBURG:  I would think it would be a very,  very big classification
system.  You get that code, you  really don't know what it means is what you are
saying.  If  someone had that code and they had a five, I still don't  know what
it means.  Moderate difficulty standing on  multiple surfaces.  What does it
mean?</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  It could mean on a soft surface, on a  regular surface.  I'm
not trying to --</P>
<P>MR. VAN AMBURG:  I know.  It's a difficult area.   If you're trying to put
statistics together and tabulate  material based on the coding structure, then
you have to  know what the results mean when you are tabulating.  I'm not  sure
how we would interpret that.</P>
<P>DR. MOR:  Vince, thinking from your experience  with like the minimum data
set for nursing home patients,  which has very explicit definitions for time and
--</P>
<P>DR. MOR:  Time and place and numbers of people,  amount of help and so on
and so forth.  In general -- I  don't know this literature at all -- but I would
assume that  there have been some kind of inter-relator reliability  testing
that has been done with this system, is that  correct?</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  Not with this.  That's what the  testing is for.  With ICIDH-2
--</P>
<P>DR. MOR:  But was there with ICIDH-1?</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  Well, with 1, yes.  The original  version, there were about
1,500 articles and publications  that pertain to its use; probably around 30 or
40 pertain to  its reliability.</P>
<P>DR. MOR:  My reading of the ICD-9/DSM-4 literature  on reliability is
basically for DSM-4 outside of the major  classes, reliability deteriorates very
rapidly, and ICD-9,  the last two digits are basically highly erratic, without 
any kind of absolute precision.  So I would assume the same  thing would apply
here.  You get 3, maybe 30, but after that  it would break down, and the other
things would be just far  grosser in their classification.</P>
<P>This approach is a nosological kind of approach,  as opposed to an
item-by-item characterization, although  that does have clearly item-by-item
characterization  components in it, because it's got movement activities.  So 
the movement activities, things like standing, moving,  transferring, those kind
of movements in it, and so is the  depth associated with each of those
activities.</P>
<P>I don't know the literature, but I would just  imagine the reliability is
probably not bad at the grossest  levels of aggregation.</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  Well, I'll address those points,  because those are problems,
not only with this, but with the  whole ICD family.  I know that the ICD-10 was
tested --  Chapter 5, I know was tested extensively by NIMH, because  they have
field trial testing centers around the world.   NIMH has been very involved from
the very beginning, which  is why the mental/cognitive aspects of ICIDH-2 are so
much  more developed.</P>
<P>I dare say that much of the rest of ICD-10 was not  tested so thoroughly. 
Much of it is just out there.  So I  would say we're doing a pretty good job of
testing this, but  it won't be a perfect job, but it will be probably on a par 
with the other ICD family of classifications.</P>
<P>The other thing I can say is about training.  We  did some ICIDH training
tools.  We have a computerized  training tool called Code IDH, where ten cases
come up on  the screen.  You only work one case at a time.  It's a  narrative,
and it might be written by a clinician.  Then you  code the impairment
disability and handicap, typically 10 or  12 of those codes per case.  You get a
smiley face if you  code it correctly, or a big hint if you do it wrong, and 
three chances to do it wrong before the right answer finally  pops up.</P>
<P>It's a very user friendly thing, because it's on  DOS and Windows and it's
very cheap.  It's $75.  So people  can practice that coding to get reliability. 
So we plan the  same kind of tools with ICIDH-2 once we are a little bit  firmer
with the way that classification will finally end up.</P>
<P>I wouldn't be surprised in the next six months if  we didn't have a contract
in place for ICIDH-2 to develop  standardized coding procedures, so that we can
have two  nosologists code the same thing on the same way.</P>
<P>DR. IEZZONI:  We're really struggling to make sure  that as our subcommittee
colleagues on standardization and  data sets think about what kind of
information should be  collected on each health care encounter, that there be 
information collected on how the patient is doing.  So we  are really struggling
with trying to think about what we  might recommend in terms of how to code
that.  So that is  why hearing this presentation is very helpful to us.</P>
<P>We heard Gretchen Swanson in San Francisco.  She  was very enthusiastic. 
She, I guess, has a number of  private clients who she serves as a consultant
to, who use  ICIDH-1.  I asked her the question back in June about why  ICIDH
wasn't used more widely in the United States.  She  indicated that it is used
widely in other countries.  I  think Europe, maybe France uses it widely.</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  Do you want an answer to that?</P>
<P>DR. IEZZONI:  Yes.</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  That one's pretty easy.  You said  there were 45 disability
definitions in the U.S.  Just about  all of them are associated with different
programs that were  funded by Congress.  Those were politically designed 
programs, that when a pressure group decided that something  needed to be done
for veterans in certain categories, and so  it goes.</P>
<P>The definition is really politically crafted by  the AIDS.  They scurried
and looked for definitions, and  trying to be sensitive to the political
realities, and they  often compromised on what categories are covered or not.  
This is how they devolve.  This is why they are wedded to  the definitions they
are using.</P>
<P>Bear in mind that none of the definitions they are  using are either U.S.
standard, world standard, or any  standard.  They are just their own.  They just
created them,  because they needed them for purposes of legislation.</P>
<P>DR. IEZZONI:  So why, since ICIDH has been around  since 1980, why haven't
we seen it more in the U.S.?</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  Well, first of all, it was done by  the WHO and published
really in English, but by a British  physician, so it was not an American
product.  I think we're  very ethnocentric.  The first translation was into
Dutch.   Naturally it was into French and so on.  Of course, we  didn't need to
translate it, but then why should we pay any  attention to it, because we didn't
invent it?  I think that  is the quickest, simplest answer.</P>
<P>Another one is it is the standard of course, for  all their programs, for
all their policies.  It's the gold  standard for their programs, for their
disability programs,  for their employment programs.</P>
<P>It was picked up in Canada even before the United  States.  They did three
national health surveys structured  around ICIDH.  Now federal agencies are
beginning to pay  more attention, especially as it is being revised, and 
especially as quite a few Americans are involved, because  the Americans are in
tune with U.S. data and policy needs.</P>
<P>DR. IEZZONI:  When you say federal agencies, who  seems to be the most
interested?</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  Let me answer you with a slide that I  didn't put up yet.  It
will start out with National Center  for Environmental Health on the top.  The
National Center  for Environmental Health, which is a part of CDC, just  funded
as of August 1, three $800,000 projects to develop  assessment tools that are
really structured questionnaires  and so on, so that the information can be
directly coded to  ICIDH-2.  So these contracts are now in effect with Gale 
Whiteneck and David Gray.  So there's one.</P>
<P>Also NCEH is building a new BRFSS disability  surveillance system using
ICIDH to orient its disability  questions.  The BRFSS is a short telephone
survey done in  all the states, but they are adding a disability module, 25 
questions, and they have funded 15 states $350,000 a year  for four years.  Next
year they hope to fund all the rest of  the states.  They will be codable and
back codable to ICIDH- 2.</P>
<P>DR. MOR:  You mentioned that a number of times,  the codable and back
codable into ICIDH.  If would be very  helpful to me -- is there a protocol for
how one does that?   Or is it specific to the given illness?</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  If you look at a structured  questionnaire which asks do you
have difficulty in seeing?   We might follow it through like seeing an objective
clearly  at 20 feet or something like that.  Now it would be more  specific than
that, but if you get a yes to that, and  specific information about how much
difficulty of seeing,  then that would be codable.  You could be able to put a 
numerical code, an ICIDH code.</P>
<P>DR. MOR:  The National Center did a disability  survey.</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  Right.</P>
<P>DR. MOR:  Is that back codable?</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  Yes.</P>
<P>DR. MOR:  Was that designed for the back codable  purpose?</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  It wasn't designed that way.  Any  survey can be back coded. 
Any disability survey can be back  coded to ICIDH.  In some cases there are
judgment calls, but  the disability survey was not designed specifically to be 
back coded to ICIDH-2, although it will be, and is being  back coded to it.</P>
<P>DR. MOR:  So you're creating, somebody is creating   a code of 70, 80, 90
different questions on disability,  impairments and inability to function, what
kind of assisted  devices, all those kinds of things, and collapsing them into 
three separate codes?</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  Yes, those 70, 80, 90 questions, if  there are yes hits in some
area of disability, it might  convert to eight or nine codes.  If the questions
can give  you enough specificity, then you can go to maybe third digit  or
fourth digit on an ICIDH-2 code.</P>
<P>DR. MOR:  In some of the dimensions?</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  Yes.</P>
<P>I'm taking up more than my share of time.</P>
<P>DR. IEZZONI:  This has actually been very helpful  I think.  It has given a
lot of folks much more information.</P>
<P>Are there any pressing questions for Paul right  now before we move on to
some of the other speakers?</P>
<P>MR. VAN AMBURG:  I'm just wondering how they are  going to structure the
questions on the test to get any  consistent and reliable data.</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  The questions have been tested in the  NCHS cognitive lab. 
Last week a preliminary report was  given to the CDC on the BRFSS.  We had all
the state people  for these 15 states that are going to be using them.   Barbara
Wilson is here today, and she works at the lab, and  she was directly involved
in testing the questions.  So you  might have more questions for Barbara.</P>
<P>MR. VAN AMBURG:  I'm kind of interested in the  back coding of this from a
telephone survey.  I'm looking at  what you had up there on the movement.  If
they have a  question on that, how would you back code it from one of  those?</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  Most likely it will be to a one or  two digit level.  You are
just being able to say that there  is an activity impairment at the moment
level.</P>
<P>MR. VAN AMBURG:  But you won't get the level of  difficulty, the 0-9 codes?</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  Probably not, no.  You just get the  fact that there is a
difficulty, and what kind of difficulty  of movement or whatever -- seeing,
hearing.</P>
<P>MR. VAN AMBURG:  That's almost dangerous from a  policy perspective.</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  Well, I believe it's four areas of  disability, not all ten,
that are being targeted in these 25  questions.  It is not impairments, it is
not participation  codes, it's just four of the ten disability areas.  They are 
being designed so that they can be collapsed into these  areas to identify areas
of difficulty or disability.</P>
<P>DR. MOR:  So it just all of the sudden dawned on  me, a very obvious thing. 
Somebody could clearly have  multiple ICIDH coding sequences of nine or ten
digits?</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  Yes.</P>
<P>DR. IEZZONI:  California now has 25 spaces for  ICIDH codes.</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  The parallels are exactly, in my  view, the same as in
mortality coding, where you have an  intermediate cause, a contributing cause,
and an immediate  cause.  You code all those things, up to 20 or so causes of 
death, but there is a sequentiality to it.</P>
<P>In my view, there is a sequentiality to disability  coding, where
impairments lead to difficulties in activity,  which lead to restrictions in
participation, barriers in  societal participation, facilitators.  It's the same
 sequence, except it focuses on those of us who are still  living.</P>
<P>DR. IEZZONI:  I suspect that ICD-10 would say that  they code morbidity, as
well as mortality.  So we can argue  that.</P>
<P>You're going to stay, aren't you?</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  Sure.</P>
<P>DR. IEZZONI:  Okay, great, so we can hit you again  if we want to.</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  Oh, sure.</P>
<P>DR. IEZZONI:  This is all information, and very  friendly.  I hope that you
understand that we have learned a  lot from this presentation.</P>
<P>We would like to move on maybe in the order that  is listed, although
Michelle, have you gotten your breath?   Census is very interesting, because the
year 2000 census  approach is being designed as we speak right now, isn't it?  
Yes, and you're going to be asking a little bit about  disability, so let's hear
what Census is thinking.</P>
<P>MS. ADLER:  This handout that is clipped together  is something from a
decennial census notebook that has been  passed out, which I thought you might
find interesting.  The  decennial census, from a research perspective, is very 
important, because it is basically the only game in town  where you can get
state estimates, county estimates,  estimates for MSAs, and even block depending
on what you  look at.</P>
<P>We just still on our national population-based  surveys sometimes we are
able to get estimates for large  states or for medium-sized states to pool data.
 Basically,  we just can't get local area estimates except from the  decennial
census, but that is not its purpose.  It's the  only survey in the Constitution,
and the purpose of the  decennially census is to come up with the apportion for
the  House of Representatives.</P>
<P>Every ten years, when we get involved with the  Census Bureau and their
various work groups, we are reminded  incessantly that Thomas Jefferson was the
first leader of  the Census Bureau, and they pull out John Adams and all  these
people, the Founding Fathers compared with our  secretaries.  They are really
into apportioning.</P>
<P>The first census in 1790, just basically got the  name, rank, serial number,
how many people in the household,  men, women and there were the racial
questions, but that was  it.  It was just for apportionment.  Gradually they
started  adding on more social variables.  In fact, in 1830, they  started
adding health and disability variables.</P>
<P>Every ten years we go through the exercise that  the Census Bureau needs
money from the House of  Representatives in order to be conducted.  The purpose
of it  is to find out who will be in the House of Representatives.   So it
becomes a very sticky political issue.</P>
<P>Their bottom line, if you go into this handout a  bit, is that you need a
statutory basis for whatever is on  the decennial census.  So we have come up
with statutory  uses and citations for disability data.  Now some data on  the
decennial census, it will say directly in legislation  that you need that data
at local levels as collected by the  decennial census.</P>
<P>For example, the Voting Rights Act for civil  rights says that directly. 
Other legislation will say  things like, you should get information at local
levels, but  it won't restrict you as to how you get it, or where you can  get
it, or perhaps even if you can get it.</P>
<P>Their first priority is any kind of language in  legislation that directly
says you have do this on the  census.  Unfortunately, there are many statutory
uses of  disability data through the ADA and from the Department of 
Transportation; EPA has some rules; the Older Americans Act.   We have lots of
legislation that refers to disability, but  nothing says outright that we should
get it at local levels  from the decennial census.  They call a program need, as
 opposed to a required need.</P>
<P>So we have kind of snuck in through the back door  on health and disability
data.  In a decennial census 100  years ago we did actually ask some health
questions, but  have really not since then, which is unfortunate.  That's my 
own personal opinion.</P>
<P>The second handout I have is the questions from  1970, 1980 and 1990, just
to show you how far we have come.   In 1970, we still only thought of disability
as a work  disability.  If a disability, whatever that is -- and I'm  glad that
I'm following Paul, where he has talked about is  disability -- but basically
the disability was something  that prevented the working age population from
working, or  limited the working age population from doing whatever it is  that
they were supposed to do, and that was it.  There was  nothing on the elderly,
nothing on children.  That was the  only aspect that was looked into.</P>
<P>In 1980, we still had information on work  disability, but there was this
question, 19c, which has got  to be one of the worst questions ever on a
decennial census  -- &quot;Does this person have a physical, mental or other
health  condition that has lasted for six months, and which limits  or prevents
this person from using public transportation?&quot;</P>
<P>I remember when that question came in, and DOT  swore up and down we needed
that.  Of course the answers,  people would say, yes, I live in Montana and we
don't have  public transportation.  So no one understood the question.   I've
never seen anyone analyze it; that doesn't mean no one  did, but that question
fell by the wayside.</P>
<P>In 1990, which is the next page, this is the  census that had the most
disability data.  We still in  question 18 had the two part work disability
question which  turned up some time during the Depression.  This time we  wanted
to get more of a flavor of disability, so question 19  is a proxy for IADLs, and
question 19b is the proxy for  ADLs.</P>
<P>We've got, &quot;Because of a health condition that has  lasted for six or
more months, does this person have any  difficulty going outside the home alone,
for example, to  shop or visit a doctor's office, or taking care of his or  her
own personal needs such as bathing, dressing, or getting  around inside the
home?&quot;</P>
<P>Well, this was expanded more, and question 18 and  19 were asked of everyone
age 15 or over.  We know that most  people who are 90 years old probably
wouldn't make much  sense of the work disability question, but nevertheless it 
was asked.  In the tables that came out of the 1990  decennial census they are
divided into ages 16-64 and 65 and  above.</P>
<P>I have a paper on results from the 1990 census if  anyone is interested. 
The estimates actually weren't that  bad.  This is where HHS did push radically
on the Bureau of  the Census.  On the ADL question for the non-elderly we got 
7.2 million, ADL or IADL question.  SIP(?) got 7.6 million,  and the disability
survey got 6.7 million.  For the elderly  the 1990 census came up with 5.9
million; SIP had 8 million;  and the disability survey had 6.8 million.</P>
<P>One of the things that happens with the year 2000  is that the Census Bureau
judges all questions on index of  reliability.  They have a national content
pretest.  They  have a variety of tests, including in the 1990 decennial  census
-- this was mailed out to about one-seventh of the  population, which is 40
million households.  About 1 million  households were given the decennial census
and questions  from SIP to test the reliability and validity of the  questions,
and also to see if some of the interviewers were  perhaps not curb stoning or
answering the questions  themselves.</P>
<P>When looking at that data, we found out that  particularly for the ADL and
IADL, the index of reliability  was high, which is bad, which means that in
their eyes that  people at time one had said they have an ADL for example,  and
then at time two they had an IADL or vice versa.</P>
<P>Now at HHS we have carried on a dialogue for many  years where we say that
the ADL question and the IADL  question are very subject to change over time. 
All of our  population-based surveys, the longitudinal ones bear this  out.  The
National Long-Term Care Survey conducted by Duke  and the National Institute on
Aging -- I don't know if you  have looked at this -- and the MCBS, but people do
change.</P>
<P>The chances of becoming disabled when you weren't  disabled are not that
high, but if you are disabled to start  with, there is a big chance of going
back and forth in the  state of disability.  Anyway, we couldn't get that point 
across, so they decided that these were bad questions.</P>
<P>DR. MOR:  What was the time frame in between the  SIP and the --</P>
<P>MS. ADLER:  Eight months.  No, I'm sorry -- yes,  eight months was the first
one.  So they decided that this  was not so good.  They did another test around
1993, where  it was five weeks in between, but the first interview was  done as
a mail out like the decennial census.  The second  one was the follow-up
interview by telephone.  They didn't  have any provisions for getting the same
person.</P>
<P>We also know from the National Medical Expenditure  Survey data from an
experiment, that if you change the mode  from mail to telephone or telephone to
personal, ADL and  IADL questions are very sensitive to change in mode.  They 
are also very sensitive to respondent.  For example, if you  ask a person with
an ADL limitation the question, and then  you ask the care giver, you are going
to get a different  answer.  Usually the care giver will say the person has a 
more severe disability.</P>
<P>Well the upshot was that the Census Bureau  designed a series of questions
in January of this year,  which is on the third page of this handout.  The
purpose of  this was to expand it.  By some miracle, we actually got  more space
on the decennial census.</P>
<P>It has taken me a while to realize this, but the  decennial census, unlike
any of our other surveys, is format  driven, not content driven.  We are reduced
in the end to  getting everything in one and three-quarters inches.  It's a 
square root type of exercise.  It's not a content exercise;  all the reasoning
and legislation in the world, it always  comes down to that.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, we are slowly getting more area,  which is an incredible
victory; I can't tell you how much.   In the 1990 decennial, even though it was
so much better  than 1980 when we had that silly public transportation 
question, we were criticized, and rightly so, because we  didn't have any
questions on children.  We didn't have  anything on total impairments.</P>
<P>So the Census had a version which has got a  question on mental tasks such
as learning, remembering and  concentrating.  They had an IADL question.  Then
there was a  question with several parts -- that's the other things,  people who
design questionnaires are adding several parts --   picking out some
disabilities from the American with  Disabilities Act.</P>
<P>That's where it gets tricky.  In the disability  survey we had hundreds of
questions on disability.  I think  there were more than 100 just on children
alone.  Depending  on what you pick, you are going to get different estimates 
of disability.  You could take an approach and say, well,  let's pick the most
popular disabilities and get a really  big number, which would be something to
do with lifting, bad  back, and maybe depression, probably walking three blocks 
would be biggies.</P>
<P>If you did that though, you would get a big  number, but you would probably
overrepresent the elderly;  people with arthritis, bad backs, and again, you
would miss  children.  So it's a very difficult thing to try to figure  out how
to fit questions into a little space that would pick  up as many aspects as
possible, and make sense given the  complex nature of disability.</P>
<P>On the last page, the federal agencies wanted the  Census Bureau to re-look
at the disability questions, so OMB  convened a work group this summer which met
two or three  times every week at OMB.  That is how many of us spent our 
summer.</P>
<P>That version and the Census version are being  tested right now in a
cognitive lab.  In fact, tomorrow I'm  going one block up the street to hear two
interviews.  The  results of the cognitive tests will be done probably next 
week.  They'll start writing them up.</P>
<P>There may be a dress rehearsal in the spring.  The  Census Bureau is
currently -- they don't know if they are  going to get funding for that.  This
little controversy is  part of a larger controversy that the Census is facing in
 regard to sampling for the House of Representatives.</P>
<P>Should that go ahead, one of these versions or  parts of the version would
be in the draft for the 1998, and  they will have to start printing up the
forms.</P>
<P>DR. IEZZONI:  Are the questions that are being  tested in cognitive testing
right now just the last page or  the last two?</P>
<P>MS. ADLER:  The last two.  The Census Bureau an  ADL question onto their
version.</P>
<P>DR. MOR:  Which ADL question?</P>
<P>MS. ADLER:  It is on the 2000.  They did add an  ADL question, which comes
out as 7b in this version.</P>
<P>DR. MOR:  Dress, get around inside.</P>
<P>MS. ADLER:  On the last page, what we have come up  with and what is being
tested for they call it the OMB  question, but it was really derived by the work
group  composed of the federal agencies:  HHS, the Department of  Justice, the
Department of Education, the Department of  Veterans Affairs, the National
Council on Disability, and  the President's Committee on the Employment of
People with  Disabilities, and to some extent Paul's group, an  interagency
subcommittee on disability statistics.</P>
<P>What we did is given again this little space, is  look at -- the first thing
is we tried to have as many  questions as possible which were relevant not only
to  adults, but to children so we could get some estimates on  children.  The
first one is do you have any difficulty doing  any of the activities.  One is
learn, remember or  concentrate.  In that question we hope to pick up mental 
impairments such as mental illness, Alzheimer's, learning  disabilities.  It's a
broad mental impairment question.</P>
<P>The second one, talk, see with glasses or hear is  a sensory impairment
question.  The third, walk three blocks  or lift a bag of groceries of the two
most common non-G(?)  physical functioning items.  We have the physical aspect.</P>
<P>The next one is work or keep house, which is a  role way of looking at
disability.  What functions can you  perform.  Then E and F are the IADL and the
ADL; together  the ADL and the IADL, with those questions, we can come up  with
estimates of long-term care needs.</P>
<P>That is the disability part, and we found lots of  legislation.  In fact,
the Older Americans Act refers  specifically to basic activities of daily
living.  So we  feel pretty good.  It depends on how the question is worded, 
but we felt pretty good about the legislative underpinnings  for these
questions.</P>
<P>The next one is more controversial.  The ADA does  not have the data
requirements which say we have to get data  on the U.S. Census, but the
Department of Justice is very  interested in locating geographical pockets where
there is a  lot of discrimination in employment against people with 
disabilities.</P>
<P>There are no questions.  The question is, does  this person need special
work arrangements for people with  disabilities?  We had quite a time taking
some of the  disability jargon -- we have used these words so often, we  tend to
forget what they mean -- work accommodations and  accessibility and turning them
into English.  So we'll see  if this question works, and basically get at a
measure of  how many people need these things in order to work.</P>
<P>You may notice that from this version and a Census  version, we don't have
the old historical work disability  question.  The reason we don't is that the
disability  community was very vocal in saying it wasn't the disability  that
kept them from working, it was the lack of  accommodations or suitable
environment that kept them from  working.</P>
<P>So the work disability question is still used on  the SIP for the NHIS and
it is still there, but I can see  that it is becoming fossilized.</P>
<P>DR. IEZZONI:  Will this cognitive testing involve  people from different
languages?</P>
<P>MS. ADLER:  No, in the cognitive lab we are  limited to only ten interviews
for each version.  Some of  the interviews will have like five or six people in
the  family with disabilities, so they assure me it isn't that  bad.  We may
have a field test of these versions also.</P>
<P>DR. IEZZONI:  So it will be ten tests in English.</P>
<P>MS. ADLER:  Yes.  That was a concern, especially  from the Department of
Justice, that not only these  questions but the whole decennial census be
available in  languages, and also be available in big print, and be  available
on TVD or TYY for people with hearing impairments.   There is someone at the
Census Bureau who is working on  that big, general issue.  So we feel that that
is being  taken care of.  Right now we thought we would concentrate on  English.</P>
<P>DR. IEZZONI:  Well, this has been a very eye  opening presentation I think
for all of us around the table.   I am anxious to hear from the other speakers,
but let me  just pause and see whether any of the committee has a quick 
question.</P>
<P>DR. AMARO:  You spoke earlier about the change of  not just asking people
about functioning at work, but in the  home.  Was there any consideration on the
phrasing of that  question 9 that it might be important to also look at  whether
people are in need of -- to get a sense of how many  people are in need of
special equipment, et cetera in the  home to carry out their duties in their
home?</P>
<P>MS. ADLER:  Yes, but we just didn't really have  the room for it.  That is
looked at in depth in the  disability survey.  It is sampled in some of the
other  surveys.  There is so much that we did have here.  We didn't  have
assisted devices in this section, and we really wanted  it, but we were so
limited by the space.</P>
<P>DR. AMARO:  This is my area of work that I have  done some work
collaborating on some studies looking at  functioning across different cultural
and regional groups,  and also with across gender and how that is interpreted.  
When we asked people about functioning and roles in the  family, we got a lot of
other information, especially for  women that didn't come out around functioning
at work.</P>
<P>I was just wondering whether, for example, women  with children, you might
be missing an important feature  about women's ability to carry out their duties
in the home.</P>
<P>MS. ADLER:  It's mostly because the ADA has a very  particular focus on
discrimination in employment.  Many of  the suits on the ADA have to do with
creating a barrier-free  work environment.  One of the things that we are using
to  track the progress of the ADA is the employment rate of  people with
disabilities.</P>
<P>We have very little information.  The disability  used to harass for several
years ago, which was really not  the first choice of those statisticians.  It's
just a Harris  poll.  I don't remember how they defined disability, but it  had
to be done on the telephone very quickly.  Say, would  you work if you could
work?  That is basically all the data  that we have.</P>
<P>DR. IEZZONI:  Is there any opportunity for public  comment about the census
questions?</P>
<P>MS. ADLER:  Yes.  I can't remember their schedule,  but basic topics were
presented to Congress last March.   Then the questions will be presented, and I
don't know their  time.</P>
<P>DR. IEZZONI:  We should probably we aware of when  that would be.  Can you
find that out for us?  Because we  might want to comment on some of this.  I
know that you have  like square inches that you have allotted to you, and it 
sounds like it really is territorially driven, but it might  be our at least
expressing some of our comments.</P>
<P>DR. MOR:  Just one comment.  So are you going to  be there when they
actually do the cognitive testing lab,  and observing questions and responses?</P>
<P>MS. ADLER:  Yes, two tomorrow.</P>
<P>DR. MOR:  I have done a lot of work with a word  called &quot;need.&quot; 
Pay very careful attention to what the  interpretive processes are of that word.
 One reading of  this question is they are doing it for me.  Another reading  of
this question is they are not doing it for me, and that's  why I'm not getting
it.  Another reading of the question is  that both of those apply, the union set
of those, depending  on that interpretation of the word &quot;need&quot; here.</P>
<P>It's a very complicated question because of the  parenthetical four
examples, but the root question is very  open and ambiguous, because of the
verb.  Just be very  careful in that.  You could end up with worse than what the
 1980s version was.</P>
<P>DR. IEZZONI:  I know, that's actually how I would  answer that question. 
While you were talking, I am not sure  how I would answer that question, given
that I work in a  hospital, so there are ramps in most places.</P>
<P>DR. MOR:  So if you are not incurring the  barriers, and you're all set,
then no, I don't need it.  I'm  okay.</P>
<P>MS. ADLER:  That is one of the things we're  testing, because we need child
care in order to work.  So  it's a very difficult concept.  One of the versions
we came  out with just had the language from the ADA, and it is a  question in
the disability survey which is do you consider  yourself or do other people
consider you to have a  disability?  On the disability survey there were 19
million  people that answered yes to that.  We didn't think they were  quite
ready to put that in a decennial census.</P>
<P>One last remark.  We have taken this issue to the  American Statistical
Association and asked them to work with  us to come up with another test besides
the index of  reliability that the Census uses that would be more  responsive to
health disability questions.  I think that  would help us not only in the future
to get more health and  disability questions on the decennial census.  Think
about  how the health status question would fare in such an  environment.</P>
<P>DR. IEZZONI:  Hortensia has a quick question.</P>
<P>DR. AMARO:  I was just thinking about how someone  with a mental disorder or
a psychiatric disorder or an  addiction would answer this.  I was just
wondering, if you  are trying to capture that whether the four examples can 
pertain other things besides physical environment, like  maybe you have to have
a program to assess and detect and  support people with addiction in the work
place.</P>
<P>It is makes you think only of physical.  I wonder  if you are going to miss
all the people with psychiatric and  substance abuse.</P>
<P>MS. ADLER:  I know, that's a good point.  All I  can think of are changes in
work schedule or assignment.   You're right, that's a very good point.</P>
<P>DR. AMARO:  Like having an employee assistance  program might be a condition
of a work place.</P>
<P>DR. IEZZONI:  These are excellent comments.  I  guess the reflection is we
are spending a lot of money on  the census.  We want to make sure that the
information we  get for our money can be interpreted, and that it doesn't do  us
a disservice.</P>
<P>DR. MOR:  At least it is explicitly stated what it  is, and what it isn't. 
That would be even more important.</P>
<P>MS. ADLER:  Well question 1 may not work.  I think  there are probably more
people who think it may not work  than think it may work in a decennial
environment.  It is  clear though, that in our national population surveys, we
do  need information like this, and we do need to put it on now  as part of the
regular employment questions.</P>
<P>One of the reason this is kind of awkward is we  have it on the disability
section.  It doesn't belong there.   It belongs in the employment section.  We
say, did you  work?  Why didn't you work and so on and so forth.  This  could be
one of the reasons why somebody is not working.</P>
<P>DR. IEZZONI:  Okay, well, thank you.  This has  been really fascinating. 
We'll continue to find out when  will all the testing and public comment on
that.  We'll be  very interested to hear what the results of the interviewing 
is.</P>
<P>Howard Bradley, you have been quietly sitting  there taking copious notes. 
Now we can hear from you.</P>
<P>MR. BRADLEY:  The disability evaluation study;  that is not called survey
anymore.  It's study.  The first  page is basically the four purposes of the
study.  The  contract for this has not been issues.  The RFP will be out  in the
next six months we estimate.  So it is still very  much in the formation stage,
pre-contract stage.</P>
<P>The four priorities on the bullets have shifted  over the years.  The study
goes back to 1983.  It was first  proposed and then killed by funding
considerations.  In  1992-93, SSA and Congress were concerned about the growth
of  the disability rolls, which are funded in part by trust  funds and in part
by general revenues in terms of the  Supplemental Security Income Program.  Both
programs were  growing at such an alarming rate that the trustees and  Congress
ordered us to do research in these areas.</P>
<P>Several short-term projects were funded, and the  longest term project was
the DES.  It has also been delayed  the longest.  The short-term projects
located certain areas  of growth that we had suspected related to the baby
boomers,  the growth in the children's programs, and the growth in  mental
illness, muscle-skeletal impairments over the period  in question which was 1989
to 1992.</P>
<P>They could not quantify all of the growth.  They  quantified only about 50
percent using econometric analysis.   So the larger question remains, and that
is the first  bullet here, how many adults of the ages indicated would  meet our
current eligibility criteria, and what are the  characteristics of those adults?</P>
<P>We're looking at the adults primarily, because the  children -- we knew that
there was a great deal of push in  Congress to do something about the children's
SSI program,  and they have done that.  It was part of welfare reform, and  we
saw that coming.  So we concentrated specifically on the  adult population.</P>
<P>The ages, as you know, at age 65 Social Security  beneficiaries can get
their full benefit.  Early in the next  century the full retirement is due to
increase to age 67,  and several proposals that have come out from the recent 
advisory panels proposed raising full retirement to 70.  So  hence our interest
goes up to the population through 66,  because of those concerns.</P>
<P>So the first bullet is more or less a snapshot.   What is going on out there
in terms of our current  eligibility criteria?</P>
<P>The second bullet is related to what we call the  disability process
redesign.  Under the current definition  of disability, keeping it the same in
the law, how could we  better evaluate adults in terms of their ability to work?</P>
<P>How can do we present programs better so we get  more accurate decisions,
more consistent, ones people can  understand, and ones that are easier to
administer from our  perspective?  We get several million claims a year, and 
frankly it is a huge headache.  It is a huge administrative  burden, and that
drives of course the public discontent and  congressional pressure on us to do
something.</P>
<P>The third bullet is something that SSA has been  interested in over the
years.  If you have a person with an  SSA-level disability -- I'm coining that
term -- someone who  could come on our rolls, but who is still working, what are
 they doing to be able to work in terms of the combinations  of interventions,
and things like that.</P>
<P>The fourth is the long-term, what can we do in the  future to continue to
monitor progress?  The Venn diagram is  worth a few hundred words at least.  The
big circle is the  adults in the population, the working adults.  Then there is 
this kind of a more a mass of people that probably straddle  the line, who could
meet our current eligibility criteria.</P>
<P>So I'm going to talk about bullets 1, 2, 3 and 4  in that order in terms of
our current disability definition.   I have another handout I will give at the
end -- it's very  technical -- that you can take home with you and read.</P>
<P>The first priority was to figure out how many  adults in our current
population would, if they came in and  filed, stopped working, came in and
filed, how many of those  would meet our current criteria?  The definition up at
the  top, and that is taken right from the law, is again, the  work definition. 
Defining disability for adults in terms of  work in the national economy based
on medical impairments  and their duration of 12 months or terminal illness.</P>
<P>So that's what we are working with, and that, by  the way, is also what the
redesigns worked on.  The redesign  that you probably read about is a redesign
of a process, not  a redefinition of disability.  We will talk about that in a 
moment.</P>
<P>When we do our current process we basically decide  disability claims on
some technical factors before we get  into the medical evidence.  These are
typically,  determination is made at the field office.  The local Social 
Security Office decides whether the person has enough  quarters of coverage to
meet our Social Security disability  insurance, or whether they meet the
means/residency tests  for SSI.</P>
<P>Of course aliens are in that mix too.  As part of  welfare reform there are
certain citizenship requirements,  and if they don't meet one of those, they are
out.  There is  no medical development; it doesn't matter.  They all just  say
who they are.  They don't come into our program.  They  are weeded out, denied
more quickly.</P>
<P>You have a non-working spouse of a working person.   The husband was a
school teacher.  The non-working spouse  had not enough work history to be sure
under our program.   She had ALS.  She was disabled and she doesn't get
anything.   She doesn't get any benefits.</P>
<P>So we're not interested in those people.  We are  in the survey, to be able
to identify how many people are in  that group who would meet our criteria if
they went back to  work for example, or if their family went down to the SSI 
office; things like that.</P>
<P>So in response to this, the DES, in italics there  in the middle, will
collect work history, income level,  current work activity.  That is basically
to be able to put  the data we collect in this study in front of an adjudicator 
and decide whether that person would have met our criteria  had they filed that
day.</P>
<P>Is everybody on board?</P>
<P>The more important part of the study are the  disability-related factors. 
In our current process we  collect data from treating sources, and we also
purchase  exams as needed from specialists for certain tests that have  not been
by treating sources.  We obviously get self-reports  from the claimant as they
go through their disability  interview in writing.</P>
<P>The medical file and self-reports and third party  reports are reviewed by a
state agency which SSA funds to do  this activity.  It is done by a team of a
physician or  psychologist and examiner.</P>
<P>So to make estimates of whether people in the  adult population are disabled
or not for our criteria, we  have to at least collect some of the same data that
is done  in our claims processing, whether the person is on the rolls  or not. 
So to be able to have good estimates, the DES will  have to collect the same
interview data and will also have  medical and mental status exams, and will
also collect data  from treating sources.</P>
<P>This data will be collected in a format basically,  and put in front of a
disability examiner or an SSA employee  for research purposes again, to confirm
that they can  estimate of whether that person would be eligible under our 
criteria.</P>
<P>DR. MOR:  Will only people who have filed a claim  be in the sample?</P>
<P>MR. BRADLEY:  No.  It is a national sample of  adults.</P>
<P>DR. MOR:  So if you are going to be collecting  data on me, and I haven't
filed a claim, someone is actually  going to do psychological and medical tests
and consultative  exams?</P>
<P>MR. BRADLEY:  Well, probably not consultative, but  we will ask you to
undergo a medical or mental status exam.</P>
<P>DR. IEZZONI:  How many respondents?</P>
<P>MR. BRADLEY:  Right now that is kind of in flux,  but 5,500.</P>
<P>DR. IEZZONI:  And will you pay these people?</P>
<P>MR. BRADLEY:  Yes, probably, with OMB approval.   Again, we get to the issue
of the size of the survey -- and  Michelle's comments on the census also apply
to us --</P>
<P>DR. MOR:  Well, no, it is more than just the size  of the survey.  This is
an issue of a particular kind of  bias, and the value of the time of the
individual to subject  themselves to these kinds of tests will directly relate
to  the economics of the value of their time as a person with an  impairment or
a disability who chooses to continue working.</P>
<P>DR. IEZZONI:  Yes, for example, would you agree to  this?</P>
<P>DR. MOR:  How much is the value of your time for  going to some kind of such
and such test given the  opportunity costs, when you are exactly the kind of
person  who, because of what's between your ears as opposed to other  parts of
your body --</P>
<P>DR. IEZZONI:  Right, exactly.</P>
<P>MR. BRADLEY:  Do you have any ideas in this area?</P>
<P>DR. IEZZONI:  Pay well.</P>
<P>DR. MOR:  As an economist would say, you would  have to have a differential
payment source as a function of  income in order to have non-differential
attrition or  refusals.  So you've got a big problem.  Given if you have a 
straight random sample, the number of events of interest  will be very rare in
the population of 5,500.</P>
<P>DR. IEZZONI:  So you are going to have to  oversample.</P>
<P>MS. RIMES:  Right.  We're not just talking about  oversampling.  You have to
target or do what HIS had done,  or screen the sample in an initial process.</P>
<P>DR. MOR:  Like the disability survey, but you  might want to use a more
targeted question on the disability  survey.</P>
<P>MS. RIMES:  Yes.</P>
<P>DR. AMARO:  Is this going to be done also in  English only, or other
languages?</P>
<P>MR. BRADLEY:  I don't think we've talked about it.   Do you recommend
Spanish?</P>
<P>DR. AMARO:  Well, I think you need to look at the  issue of language,
because you are in a mental population  that might have a very different
profile.  The answer to all  these questions that you had earlier might be
different for  those different groups.</P>
<P>DR. IEZZONI:  And geographic issues I think are  going to be very important,
because people's ability to work  may be very dependent upon what kind of
employment is  available.  If you are living in a place where most people  are
laborers on a farm, you are going to have very different  attitudes about
whether you can work, as opposed to if you  are in a city where there are a
variety of different job  types that you could get.</P>
<P>So this is going to be a tremendously challenging  project to do well.</P>
<P>DR. MOR:  There is very substantial geographic  state level variation in the
disability rates precisely  because of the politics of the contracts, and the
disability  assignment process, both in its interrelationship to state 
disability policies, as well as federal disability policies.   Which means that
you have got big sampling issues related  to the state overlay.</P>
<P>DR. IEZZONI:  So Howard, I feel as if we are being  very professorial in
your direction, appropriately so, but I  am a little bit concerned.  At what
point are decisions  going to be made about what your sample is going to be?  
What your sampling strategy is going to be?  Who is going to  be making those
decisions?  When is this going to happen?</P>
<P>MR. BRADLEY:  Well, we are aware of these issues.   We are attempting right
now to hire a project officer for  this survey.  I can't address them.  I'm not
in a position  to address them.  I don't have the background to do that.</P>
<P>The Institute of Medicine has a committee to  review the research related to
the disability process  redesign.  They included in that DES, so they have just
come  out with a report raising some of the same issues.</P>
<P>DR. IEZZONI:  Is there any way we can help you on  this?  I think it's
obvious that a number of us around the  table have some serious concerns.  Given
that you are at the  very earliest level, I know you have the Institute of 
Medicine looking over your shoulder, but we are another body  that could be
potentially useful.</P>
<P>MR. BRADLEY:  I think the best way you, with your  time constraints that we
heard about this morning, would be  to send me your comments.  I'll give you my
card and you can  send it by e-mail or whatever, and I will feed them into the 
process.  That's all I can suggest.</P>
<P>DR. IEZZONI:  Okay, well, we will think about  that.</P>
<P>DR. AMARO:  Can I just add, is there any more  detailed information about
the study, purpose and design, et  cetera, that we could respond to?  That might
help us.</P>
<P>MR. BRADLEY:  I'll get that for you.  We have  published as sources, a
request for industry review about a  year and a half ago.  We put in the Federal
Register, plans  related to the redesign, to include a synopsis of the DES.  
I'll give you the dates of those.</P>
<P>Let me just go on and talk about the other aims of  DES.  The first bullet
on the page you just have seen, again  we have the statutory definition of
disability.  Under the  redesign we committed to research on changing the
disability  decision process, with greater emphasis on direct evaluation  of
functions related to work.</P>
<P>So the other major purpose of the DES will be  provide a national sample of
adults for testing of  functional tests when the DES goes in the field in a few 
years from now.  Long range we expect to have functional  tests to administer
for the purpose of testing it for our  disability claims process.</P>
<P>The third purpose, and that is in the middle of  the page, the SSA has
proposed legislation and there are  other bills coming up; two last year that
were introduced or  re-introduced or will be re-introduced this year on 
basically testing claimants in our process with vocational  assessments at the
time of in-take.</P>
<P>We expect probably in the next year's  congressional session for there to be
some kind of amalgam  or compromise.  There are going to be a lot of
negotiations  on how SSA would offer job placement services to job  claimants or
beneficiaries.  SSA has a proposal which  involves offering Medicaid coverage to
working  beneficiaries.  You will probably hear more about that.   Obviously,
the DES could provide data on what enables or  what people use to work in
today's economy.</P>
<P>Finally, the last purpose, which is the last  bullet on your first page, is
the linking of DES, so that we  don't have to do this every five years.  It is
likely we  will have to go with linking of the data with other surveys,  other
administrative data that we already collect via claims  of beneficiaries to
monitor the levels of disability in the  future.</P>
<P>Now as promised, one of the things that I do at  SSA is I'm on a work group
within the agency, and we are  basically conducting research on the disability
process.  I  talked to the issue of the redesign.  How do we make our 
determinations better, more accurately?  I have summarized  basically some of
the projects from 1995 and 1996, up to the  present.</P>
<P>The last bullet contains the Institute of Medicine  interim report on the
DES, which came out about a month and  a half ago.</P>
<P>The next handout is just an overview description  of the IOM contract to
review the research involved in the  disability decision process.</P>
<P>As promised, I will have another handout with our  definition of disability.</P>
<P>DR. IEZZONI:  That's great.  Is there anything  more?</P>
<P>Are there any pressing questions?  Otherwise, I  would like to move on. 
Please go ahead.</P>
<P>DR. RUSSELL:  I was asked here today to help out  Gerry Hendershot, who was
supposed to be here to talk about  the disability software.  I will be giving
some introductory  background information on the National Health Interview 
Survey Disability Supplement.</P>
<P>Please feel free to slow me down, stop me and ask  questions if there is any
need for clarification on any  issues.</P>
<P>Just a brief introduction.  It is a household  survey.  We take all families
that are within the household.   Usually there is one family.  We only focus on
the  civilian, non-institutionalized population, so we don't do  nursing homes,
and we don't go into prisons.</P>
<P>It is the nationally representative probability  sample.  This particular
supplement was conducted in two  years, 1994 and 1995.  This big, massive
questionnaire here  is just phase one.  It was a lot.</P>
<P>The great thing about this questionnaire, the  supplement is the wide range
of issues that are dealt with,  and we will cover those in the next slide.  The
other idea  behind the supplement too is that there is no one definition  of
disability in the supplement.  It is left up to the  analyst to figure that out.
 Put all different kinds of  questions together and make up your own definition.</P>
<P>In terms of a little bit of background on it,  cost-wise, who knows?  Twenty
million more or less, who  knows?  I don't know how much, but that's a rough
estimate.</P>
<P>MS. ADLER:  Thirteen point seven.</P>
<P>DR. RUSSELL:  Plus the two bases of the data, and  all the time it takes to
clean up the data and get it out to  the public.  So there is a lot to it.</P>
<P>It is amazing that 18 federal agencies and one  private foundation were able
to get together and coordinate  this, and get all their ideas together into one
survey.   That kind of gives you the breadth or the complexity of  this.</P>
<P>The Census Bureau conducted the field work for us,  two years, two phases,
and we will talk about the two  phases.  We released the data on an IBM
mainframe CD-ROM.</P>
<P>Now let's talk about just phase one.  It's a base  interview within the
household.  This big questionnaire was  administered after the core
questionnaire that the HIS  fields every year, which is the same questions every
year.   All family members -- the whole sample was asked all the  questions.  We
did allow for proxies, for instance children  were not allowed to respond for
themselves.  The most  knowledgeable adult answered for the child.  That is the
HIS  always conducts their interviews.</P>
<P>It is possible that one adult answered for all  family members, if that is
all that was home at the time of  the interview.  We also allowed field
representatives from  Census to finish up the interview; if they couldn't finish
 it all in one setting, to call them back on the phone, and  finish it up on the
phone.</P>
<P>The interesting thing about the phase one  questionnaire is that it was the
major screener for phase  two, for how we selected respondents for our
disability  follow back survey, which is the phase two.</P>
<P>Well, I can't list all the hundreds of questions  in phase one, but I can
give you a broad topic of what kind  of questions you might find -- sensory,
communication,  mobility impairment.  The list is lengthy.</P>
<P>We do focus quite a bit on children; their special  needs, details and
education.</P>
<P>Two questions towards the end of phase one survey  I find quite interesting
was the questions of do you  yourself perceive yourself to be disabled?  Number
two is,  do you think other people perceive you to be disabled?   Those are very
good sociological questions.  Then we have a  whole litany of demographic
questions.  That was phase one,  how we measured and what content was.</P>
<P>Let's talk about phase two and some background on  that.  We refer to the
phase two as the disability follow  back survey, DFS.  In order to have received
this  questionnaire, you would have had to have answered certain  questions on
the core questionnaire, certain questions on  the phase one questionnaire, and
in another supplement  called the interasset supplement.  For various reasons,
we  picked certain questions.  Depending on how you responded to  those, you
were picked for phase two.  So not the whole  sample got phase two.</P>
<P>Phase two was also face-to-face.  We interviewed  the selected respondent
based on their answers previously  given, and again, proxies for kids. 
Sometimes if we picked  an adult that wasn't home, or we couldn't find them, we 
would ask another eligible adult about them, so we did  proxies for them too.</P>
<P>Phase two is a little bit more complex in that  there are four different
types of questionnaires for phase  two, and it really breaks down by age.  So
there is a  questionnaire just for kids, one for adults, and one for  older
people, and then for polio.  In general, if you want  to know the content of the
phase two questionnaire, it was  more specific and refined questions on other
topics.</P>
<P>In general these were the topics that we covered  in the phase two
questions.  So we asked more about serious  impediments in transportation.</P>
<P>Now that we all know the content and how it was  administered, don't we all
just want to go analyze the data?   So let's talk about this 1994 data.  Well,
1994 phase one  data is out.</P>
<P>We captured 107,000 people, and our response rate  was 87 percent, a little
bit less than our core, because by  the time you go through the core
questionnaire and you get  to this, did have some people drop out.  In general,
there  really was no bias for the people that were dropping out.   There is no
one category of people who are always dropping  out all the time.  The data was
released in July 1996.</P>
<P>The question on all of your minds is, oh, please  more data.  When can I
have more data?  Well, phase two we  suspect will come out in the winter of
1998.</P>
<P>MS. ADLER:  Does that mean like 1997 and 1998  winter, or the following
year?</P>
<P>DR. RUSSELL:  Well, if you really want to pin me  down on a date, the reason
I said winter is because the data  is always changing, so it could be
December-January- February, somewhere in there.</P>
<P>DR. IEZZONI:  But it's not December 1998, it's  more like January 1998?</P>
<P>DR. RUSSELL:  Right.  So it's closer to January- February 1998.</P>
<P>The 1995 data estimated date of release -- I'm not  going to promise any
dates, because these are always  changeable, but we think that October 1997,
phase one of the  1995 data will be out, and phase two more spring of 1998.</P>
<P>DR. MOR:  Will the 1994-1995 have a direct linkage  so that they can be
added, or can you just add to those  weights?</P>
<P>DR. RUSSELL:  Good question.  We have two  questions.  In terms of linking,
it is just a matter of  merging.  They are not the same people, so you don't
have to  link people.  So it's just a matter of merging data by your  weights by
two if you want an estimate of one year.</P>
<P>The other tricky part of your question is this  survey straddles two
sampling design meters.  Our sampling  design changed in 1995.  So we have yet
to work out the  process whereby --</P>
<P>DR. MOR:  The adjudicated weights.</P>
<P>DR. RUSSELL:  Yes.  In terms of those who used to  get again, the variance
estimations, that is going to be  tricky too, because of the sampling design
changes.  That is  still to be worked out.  We are well aware of the problem.</P>
<P>Other questions before I deluge you with some  data?  You're all tired by
now, so I'm safe.</P>
<P>Earlier I mentioned that there is no one  definition of disability.  This
little graph -- what we did  was we took the SIP definition of disability and
severe  disability, looked at their definition, and then went back  to similar
questions on the HIS and tried to recreate that  with the data, which you can do
fairly well.</P>
<P>If you look at John McNeil's publication for 1991- 92 SIP data, it kind of
follows the same trends.  We are  kind of picking up the same type of thing by
age.  So that's  one way you could do it.</P>
<P>If you were interested in modeling the ADA's  definition of disability,
there are plenty of questions in  there to do that too.  You could probably do a
pretty good  job.</P>
<P>Other ways of maybe looking at disability would be  maybe estimates of well,
how many people have an ADL  problem?  How many people had an IADL problem or a 
functional limitation?  How many people perceive themselves  as disabled?  How
did they see other people perceiving  themselves?  So that's another way of
doing it.</P>
<P>One last little data slide here is we have  assisted devices information
too.  Hopefully, in the next  couple of months we will be having a new
publication coming  out at NCHS looking at assisted device usage.</P>
<P>DR. MOR:  Vision?</P>
<P>DR. RUSSELL:  Any type of device used for a vision  impairment.</P>
<P>DR. MOR:  Not glasses?</P>
<P>DR. RUSSELL:  No, different from glasses.</P>
<P>Another strength of this survey is since HIS  fielded so many supplements in
1994, and you could use the  phase one 1994 data, and link it up by person to
all the  other supplements that we have too.  So if you are  interested in some
year 2000 objectives, and you want to  link it back to some disability issues,
you could do that.   All of these are supplements that we fielded in 1994, and 
they are all linkable by person.  You can do it.</P>
<P>One important one that I would point out is the  income and asset
supplement.  That has a lot of employment  information.  It has SSI, SSDI
information, which also may  be very important.  That is not released yet, but
it soon  will be, because it has completed being imputed at the  University of
Michigan in terms of income.  That is the only  thing we imputed.</P>
<P>DR. MOR:  Is the health insurance module out yet?</P>
<P>DR. RUSSELL:  Yes.</P>
<P>DR. MOR:  Just as an aside, how did you link them?</P>
<P>DR. RUSSELL:  Each person in the data file has a  unique number, and that's
how you link them up.  We do not  have Social Security number on our data file. 
It is one of  the highest non-response items in our questionnaire.</P>
<P>In terms of what you can do analytically, these  are things that I just came
up with.  You may have other  areas of interest.  You could analyze it by age
groups if  you wanted to, or you could take a look at just specific  maybe
policy groups.  That's not an official word, it's just  a way of looking at
certain groups of people and how you may  want to assess it.</P>
<P>If you wanted to look at SSDI recipients or  applicants in any particular
way, you can do that too.  If  you want to just look at people that are
receiving some kind  of disability pension, you can do it that way too.  So
there  is plenty of material combined here in things to do.</P>
<P>In terms of the data being out, having only been  out for about a year yet,
it is still very rich in what can  be done with it.  There is more data to come.</P>
<P>It is a complex survey in terms of just its  magnitude, so I would encourage
you, if you have further  questions for clarification, or you want some
documentation  of the actual data, the questionnaire, anything of that  nature,
I would encourage you to contact me.  I would be  happy to help you out.</P>
<P>DR. IEZZONI:  Are there any quick questions for  Dr. Russell?</P>
<P>MS. WARD:  Why polio?</P>
<P>MR. RUSSELL:  Well, I think to give you a  political answer, I think someone
had some money in the  right places, and they wanted to do that, but Michelle
can  probably answer that better.</P>
<P>MS. ADLER:  It was to look at the effects of post- polio syndrome.  The
sample size and age was big enough to  come up with people like that.  So in
phase one there were  many questions to identify people who had ever had polio, 
and the questionnaire for people who had polio is very good.   You should
probably look at it.  It includes not only  medical aspects, but social and
rehabilitative aspects of  polio.</P>
<P>MS. WARD:  I was just thinking as a condition it  has been eliminated.</P>
<P>DR. IEZZONI:  It's the post-polio syndrome.</P>
<P>Any other questions?  Great, thank you, Dr.  Russell.  The clarity of your
presentation was great.  It  was very helpful to hear about the NHIS since we
heard about  it in its infancy or its prenatal state too.  I congratulate  you
on that.</P>
<P>Gerry, the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey?</P>
<P>MR. ADLER:  Sure.  I'll try and be as quick as  possible, as everybody else
I know has a lot to cover.</P>
<P>I want to talk the survey the Health Care  Financing Administration conducts
called the Medicare  Current Beneficiary Survey, the MCBS.  Medicare is one of 
our two programs, the other being Medicaid.  We don't yet  have a survey of
Medicaid beneficiaries.</P>
<P>Since 1991 we have had an ongoing survey of  Medicare beneficiaries, a
random sample.  First, I'll tell  you about it, and then I will show you some of
the questions  and answers from it.</P>
<P>The MCBS originated in the Actuary's Office of  HCFA.  The idea came from
the need to estimate the sources  and the objects of health care spending.  We
have always had  claims data available for analysis, but we have not had the 
kind of detail, nor the information that isn't reflected in  the claims about
what health care people utilize, and how  they pay for it.  The Actuary is also
frequently to model  the consequences of alternative program policies, and thus 
needs a comprehensive source of information on a sample  basis.</P>
<P>As I said, we began interviewing in 1991.  Since  then MCBS has been a
multi-purpose resource for HCFA and the  department and other health care
researchers in government,  foundations and universities.  We have one of our
customers  here.</P>
<P>I just want to mention that since the recent  reorganization of HCFA, you
will find us in the Office of  Strategic Planning, not in the Actuary's Office,
but it  doesn't matter a whole lot; we are still doing the same  thing.</P>
<P>The MCBS is a continuous survey of a nationally  representative sample of
Medicare beneficiaries, sampled  from HCFA's enrollment files.  The sample size
ranges from  12,000 to 16,000, depending on the round.</P>
<P>The MCBS is longitudinal in that sample persons  are interviewed every four
months over a substantial period  of time.  The periodicity is because we want
to collect an  ongoing record of the services they use, their coverage, and  the
payments.</P>
<P>The interview is conducted in the household or the  long-term care facility
in person, using computer assisted  personal interviewing or CAPI.  I do not
have a copy of the  questionnaire here, because it is in the computer.  It is a 
computer program which automatically guides the interviewer  through the
questions.</P>
<P>The questionnaire focuses on financial issues,  insurance coverage, the
utilization of services, a detailed  account of charges and who pays, plus
characteristics of the  respondent, his or her situation, health status and 
functioning, access and satisfaction, and a long list of  personal
characteristics.</P>
<P>It also permits the insertion of supplementary  sections on timely topics. 
All we have do to is get OMB  clearance.  It's simple.  We have developed a
process for  incorporating supplements on a routine basis.</P>
<P>The data also, when they come back from the  survey, are linked to the
respondents' Medicare claims  files, so we have overlapping and linked sources
of  information.</P>
<P>The MCBS sample represents all Medicare  beneficiaries, both aged and
disabled, and is over and under  65, whether they reside in the community or in
long-term  care facilities, whether they are in fee-for-service or  managed
care.  It is a single sample.  There are no dual  samples for household and
nursing home.  We sample from the  rolls, stratifying by age, and sampling in
PSUs.  That's it;  wherever the respondent is, we interview them with the 
appropriate instrument.</P>
<P>In sampling we use a strata, under 45, 45-64, five  year intervals for 65 to
84, and then 85 and over.  We  oversample for the under 65 and the over 85, so
that they  are adequately represented in the survey.</P>
<P>In the first four month round -- I call each four  months a round here --
the sample of 14,530 people yielded  12,674 completed interviews or 87 percent. 
Once you get  people past the first round of interviewing, the response  rate
goes up, because who drop out, drop out in the first  contact first round.  So
later rounds are in the 97-98  percent range of response rate.</P>
<P>Every year we augment the sample to bring in new  enrollees and replenish
sample cells that are depleted by  refusals and death.</P>
<P>In the last few years we began rotating the sample  after about four years. 
That is, we retire a portion of the  sample each year, and replace them with new
respondents, so  that each respondent is in the survey about four years, to 
give us about a three year observation period, allowing for  an initial
interview to get the person into the sample, and  the close out interviews at
the end.</P>
<P>I won't go into the advantages of the rotating  sample at this point unless
you ask about it.</P>
<P>Data for the MCBS are collected through a contract  with Westat,
Incorporated.  They have a permanent staff of  about 200 interviewers around the
country assigned to the  survey.</P>
<P>As I say, the community interviews are conducted  face-to-face using
computer assistance personal interviewing  or CAPI.  Since the current round, we
are also using CAPI  for the long-term care facility interviews.  The MCBS is
one  of the first major surveys to use CAPI extensively.  It  makes the
interview easier to administer.  It makes the data  more accurate, and makes it
faster.</P>
<P>As of now, the MCBS has done about 300,000  interviews in CAPI.  A lot of
surveys have gone to CAPI  since we first did.  They think they invented it, but
I  believe we were the pioneers.</P>
<P>Proxy respondents may answer the questionnaire for  the respondent, but they
must be designated; they are  usually a family member.  The interview typically
lasts an  hour, but there is considerable variation.</P>
<P>The topics of the interview I will run through  quickly.  I mentioned some
of them -- demographic  information, household composition, insurance coverage
are  asked at the beginning, and updated every round.  Annually  we ask about
health status and functioning, access to  medical care, satisfaction.</P>
<P>Each round we collect utilization and payment data  by service and type --
dental, hospital, emergency room,  inpatient hospital, institutional use, home
health medical  providers, other services, and prescribed medicines.  So we  get
very complete information; we are HCFA after all.  We  get a full accounting in
each of these areas of the charges  and payments from all sources.</P>
<P>DR. IEZZONI:  Even for your managed care patients?</P>
<P>MR. ADLER:  Yes, we ask everybody.  The problem  with managed care patients
is they don't have any good  claims.  So we are doing some pilot work to compare
the fee- for-service and managed care.  It is a tough area, and it is  going to
get to be more of a tough problem, because more and  more people are going into
managed care.  Without the  interview data, we have nothing at all.</P>
<P>So much for the descriptions.  Any questions on  that?</P>
<P>I have part of the health status functioning  questionnaire here.</P>
<P>DR. AMARO:  So the data utilization and cost are  gathered from the
respondents?</P>
<P>MR. ADLER:  Yes.  They are compared with the same  spouse that are not in
the survey or vice versa.  We make  some accommodation between the two sources.</P>
<P>DR. AMARO:  I know if you ask me, if I'm not  paying it, I don't remember,
if my insurance is covering it.   So I'm just wondering how reliable and
accurate that  information is.</P>
<P>MR. ADLER:  It's possible to use amalgamated data  on utilization.  Again,
with regard to the managed care,  that is still an open issue of how well people
can report  their utilization in managed care.</P>
<P>Does everybody have a copy of this?  I just want  to run through it, because
it I think it's much more fun to  look at questionnaires and data than talk
about survey  design, even though both are necessary.  Our initial  question in
the health status and function questions is  fairly standard.  I would like to
ask you about your health  in general compared to other people your age.  Would
you say  that your health is:  excellent, very good, good, fair or  poor?  The
only difference there is not all surveys ask,  compared to other people your
age.</P>
<P>If you look at the next page, there is tabulation  by age of the responses
to the questionnaire question.  It  is remarkable steady by age.  Roughly the
same percent of  people regard themselves, compared to their own age group,  as
excellent, very good, good, fair or poor.</P>
<P>Now there is one other factor beside the compared  to your own age question
that may be influencing these data.</P>
<P>DR. IEZZONI:  Gerry, you don't have the younger  than 65 on this page.  They
might have a slightly different  attitude about that.</P>
<P>MR. ADLER:  They do.  Most of these tables here  are about the over 65, and
about those living in the  community.  The other factor is that people with very
poor  health status who go into the nursing home may drop off of  this chart
more and more as they age, so there may be a  couple of other things working
here.</P>
<P>I was frankly amazed that either people are  reading the questionnaire, or
listening to the questions and  answering them precisely, or else something I
don't  understand is going on.  We'll compare that with some  objective
indicators of health status in a little bit.</P>
<P>The next page asks questions about cataracts and  hearing aids, difficulty
eating solid foods.  I left that in  just to show the continuity of the question
on health  status, as with the preventive care measures -- mammogram,  pap
smear, hysterectomy and flu shot on page 3.</P>
<P>The first function status questions are the non-G  items starting at the
bottom of page 4.  How much  difficulty, if any, do you have stooping, crouching
or  kneeling, continues with lifting or carrying objects as  heavy as 10 pounds,
reaching or extending arms above the  shoulder level, writing or handling or
grasping small  objects, and walking a quarter mile.</P>
<P>The next five pages have the results of those  items by age group for the
age of living in the community.   It is a somewhat different picture than the
general health  status question in that there is a decline in the ability to 
stoop, crouch or kneel with age.</P>
<P>There are some interesting differences between the  different functions. 
That is, if you look at the next page,  more people have no difficulty lifting
an object as heavy as  10 pounds than in the stooping, crouching or kneeling. 
More  people have no difficulty reaching or extending arms above  shoulder
level, handling or grasping small objects.  Then  when you get back to walking a
quarter of a mile, there is  increasing difficulty.  So you have to look at the 
differences between the items that are on the scales.</P>
<P>Has a doctor ever told you, you have -- I left  that in just as an example
of what conditions we ask about,  and what results we get.  This chart shows
both the aged and  the disabled.  What amazed me about it was that the 
disabled, that is, those under 65 have about the same rates  of these different
conditions as the aged.  It's not quite  intuitive.  They have a lot more
psychiatric disorder and  mental retardation, but when you get to pulmonary
disease,  diabetes, arthritis, they are right up there.</P>
<P>DR. CARTER-POKRAS:  How do the estimates compare  with other data sources. 
We were just looking at the  hypertension.  Has a doctor ever told you that you
had  hypertension, and that seemed really high.</P>
<P>MR. ADLER:  Which data source did you compare it  with?</P>
<P>DR. CARTER-POKRAS:  I was thinking like NHANES.</P>
<P>MR. ADLER:  Yes.</P>
<P>DR. CARTER-POKRAS:  I ask because it's a self- report here.</P>
<P>MR. ADLER:  Okay, this was over 65.</P>
<P>DR. MOR:  It should be around 34-35 percent.</P>
<P>DR. CARTER-POKRAS:  For 65 years of age.</P>
<P>DR. MOR:  For 65, yes.</P>
<P>DR. CARTER-POKRAS:  Well, this is high.</P>
<P>DR. IEZZONI:  Yes, that's high.  So these could be  people who controlled
it.  It is self-report.</P>
<P>MR. ADLER:  We'll have to look at self-report  versus proxy report.</P>
<P>The next page says the questions about ADLs and  IADLs.  These are fairly
typical questions, comparable to  other surveys.  Because of a health or
physical problem, do  you have any difficulty bathing or showering, dressing, 
eating, getting out of bed or chairs, walking?</P>
<P>Then we ask about is this because of the health,  that there are problems? 
Do you receive help?  Does someone  usually stay in the room?  Do you use
special equipment?   The IADLs are also fairly difficult on survey questions.</P>
<P>The following page shows the percent of elderly in  the community who do
report difficulties with ADLs, and  which ADLs.  Then the one after that is the
percent who  report difficulty with IADL items.</P>
<P>Finally, this computer program here is how we  define our scale of ADL.  If
someone has difficulty -- if to  the difficulty item on the ADLs they answered I
don't do  that, if they receive help or use equipment, then they get a  score
for that ADL, and we add those ADLs together.   Similarly, if they have a
problem within the high ADL, or  don't do because of health, they get a score
for the high  ADL.</P>
<P>The next to the last page shows a table of results  for ADLs and IADLs for
that scale that is defined by that  SAS(?) variable.  What is interesting to me
is that  persistence of function, that is the percent non-disabled in  the 65-69
is about 75 percent, and the percent in the 85 and  over group is still about 31
percent.  If you look at people  who have no ADLs, that is combining
non-disabled with IADL  only in the over 85 group, you have still go about 55 
percent who do not have ADLs.</P>
<P>DR. MOR:  This is the community population?</P>
<P>MR. ADLER:  Right.</P>
<P>DR. MOR:  Would the overall aggregate look much  different?</P>
<P>MR. ADLER:  Yes, you may have the spill off into  institutions of people
with the most disability, but I'm  looking at the people with the least
disability at this  point.</P>
<P>The final chart is just converting the data to a  table, into a spatial
diagram.  It is the same information,  function status by age.  You can see the
shrinkage of the  non-disabled population or the proportion of the population 
doesn't disappear.</P>
<P>I have one more thing for you.  This is for your  later perusal.  This is an
excerpt from a volume that Westat  has prepared, and will prepare on an annual
basis called  &quot;The Health and Health Care of the Medicare Population.&quot;</P>
<P>DR. IEZZONI:  It is nice.</P>
<P>MR. ADLER:  It wasn't as slick.  I think if we  sold it, it would have to
cost about $20 or $30.</P>
<P>This is just the introductory chapter giving the  highlights and findings,
and the technical appendix, which  describes much more thoroughly the
methodology of the  survey.</P>
<P>DR. IEZZONI:  Gerry, thank you.  That was a great  presentation.  I think we
have had four wonderful  presentations, actually five that have showed us the 
diversity of the way people think about disability.   Frankly, I'm not sure how
to deal with this, because there  is just a tremendous amount of diversity.</P>
<P>I think that we might like to try to get out  early, but I would like to
hear from Paul and Michelle, your  final thoughts, because you have been in the
trenches of  this for many years, and have a lot of experience dealing  with the
diversity of definitions within the federal  government and its implications.</P>
<P>Can you just give us some summary thoughts that  you have about this issue,
and how our committee might be  able to help think about it?</P>
<P>MS. ADLER:  I guess it was five or six years ago  when I came to the
Subcommittee on Mental Health Statistics  and Long-Term Care.  At that time the
Social Security rolls  were beginning to take off.  The ADA had been enacted. 
We  were getting a lot of rumblings on SSI for kids and we had  basically no
information on disability.  The only thing we  had was the 1978 survey on
disability in work by Social  Security, plus some elderly surveys here and
there.</P>
<P>At that time, the committee was very helpful in  supporting the notion of
the disability supplement, and also  the committee took a very active role in
developing the  mental health questions on the disability survey.  That was  one
of the big steps.  We basically had to start from the  ground up.</P>
<P>The entire committee was very helpful during those  early years.  I would
quite like to thank you now, because  that was just a tremendous effort, and I
don't know if we  could have gone forward without the committee's help.</P>
<P>We are now at a different point.  We do have  disability data.  It may not
all be in on the CD-ROM, but we  do have it.  It has been collected.  At least
the  consciousness raising of disability is now to the point  where we have got
a disability exam study is becoming real,  the MCBS has functioning questions,
SIP has much better  functioning questions than they had in the past, and we
have  more square inches on the decennial census.</P>
<P>Now we have all this data.  What should we do with  it?  Particularly if you
look at children, one of the best  things about the disability survey is it is
really the first  and only comprehensive survey of disability in children ever 
attempted in the U.S.  Particularly for children under five,  the whole concept
of disability, what does it mean if a  three year old needs help with whatever
it is they are  supposed to do, because we are kind of unclear about what it  is
they are supposed to do.</P>
<P>There are many research issues that can come out  of the disability survey
in regard to children, and there  are also a number of methodological issues. 
We went for the  overkill approach.  Someone suggested the question and we  put
it on basically, but there have got to be many overlaps  between these
questions.</P>
<P>There has got to be a core set of questions on  children's disability, and
also on the working age and the  elderly that we need to look into.  We need to
do it in a  stricter, more scientific way certainly than is being done  in the
year 2000 census.  We can take this data and look at  it logically and
rationally, and come up with some  recommendations on data elements that work,
data elements  that don't work, and approach this thing so that the 2010  census
and all these other surveys that will happen in the  next few years, we won't be
scrambling quite so much.</P>
<P>The other comment I might just say that was  brought up by the disability
evaluation study, but what has  happened in regard to the ADA and to the work 
accommodations, and particularly with computers is that the  whole work
environment is changing.  What does it mean if  you have a disability if you can
work?  It is good to do a  physical exam.  It is good to do a mental exam.  It
is good  to examine the local economy for employment and look at the  person's
education and so on and so forth, but in our work  with children in special
education, they are now saying that  anyone, regardless of their disability, can
use a computer  and I believe that, so that they can function.</P>
<P>My boss as of last Monday, the deputy assistant  secretary for disability
and long-term care is Bob Williams,  and he has severe mobility impairments. 
He's in a scooter.   He has the guide dog, and he has speaking impairments.  
He's difficult to understand, but he has a machine called a  Liberator, and it
is like a big keyboard.  He goes like this  and he presses keys, and it speaks
for him.</P>
<P>He was able to get through graduate school and be  a political appointee and
do lots of very good work.  So the  assisted devices are taking off on their
own, and the whole  notion of work environment and work accommodation is rapidly
 changing while we sit here and argue about disability  questions.</P>
<P>The other thing that you can help us with are  these changes in disability. 
We were doing good a few years  ago to have any information on disability.  A
point in time,  even if it was a long time ago, if we had one point, we  would
have been so happy to have that information, but the  MCBS is longitudinal.  SIF
is longitudinal.</P>
<P>Looking at changes in disability and separating  out changes due to mode of
interviewing, maybe some  questionnaire and non-sampling and sampling errors of
true  changes due to rehabilitation or deterioration of condition  or disability
would be something that we would need a lot of  help with in the future.</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  My comment would be five years ago  next month the National
Committee helped the ICIDH with a  boost with hearings on ICIDH.  It turned out
to be the  largest gathering ever in the United States on that topic.   About 25
people around the U.S. who had been using it one  way or another, testified to
the committee.  So that was  kind of a jumping off point for getting involved in
the  revision process.</P>
<P>So I hope the National Committee will keep one  thing in mind.  This kind of
comes up today.  Whenever you  talk about disability, we have heard about the
Medicare  study and the SSA survey and the census questions and the  HIS
questions.  What we have is a lot of different methods  of assessing disability,
and as a result we have a lot of  non-comparable definitions.</P>
<P>It is likely that many of the data can't be  compared, and so the programs
can't talk to each other  statistically.  The same is true with the U.S. and the
 world.  The U.S. can't talk to any other country in terms of  disability
definitions, because so many different  definitions are used.  What we have is a
Tower of Babel.</P>
<P>So to me, my work in the ICIDH has reinforced that  we need to look for the
gold standard, and try and use that  framework in framing up our disability
questions and  analysis.  That's my parting shot.</P>
<P>DR. IEZZONI:  That's very helpful.  We should talk  tomorrow about whether
the committee that is looking at  coding data and transmission standards might
be able to join  us in helping us think about how to code disability 
information.</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  The key is standardized assessment  tools, which are being
developed with the new revisions.</P>
<P>DR. IEZZONI:  Do any of the committee members have  any final thoughts or
questions?</P>
<P>MS. WARD:  I have one.  We're very focused now on  the disabled.  Is there a
need, or is that being met through  other -- are employers meeting any of these
demands?  What  is the employer's response to the ADA?  Because of this 
enormous technology, are schools responding by allowing  children to bring
computers?</P>
<P>I'm thinking of the response to the disabled.  If  we haven't done this
particularly well, and we can't  standardize this, I also don't want to go over
and --</P>
<P>DR. PLACEK:  ADA has got another definition of  disability in law.  There
are no good data on it except  complaints.</P>
<P>I started to say, I know the HISD as much as any  other analyst, but the
HISD has every definition of  disability, because there were four or five major
agencies,  and they were all funding, so they all wanted to make sure  this or
that question was in it.  So we collected them all,  and in a sense it gets at
something of everything.</P>
<P>You're asking an ADA question, and is there a  survey designed around ADA? 
I think the answer is no.</P>
<P>MS. WARD:  I'm also thinking of schools.  If you  are in health care, you
are also dealing with children who  have special health care needs, whose
families are trying to  get these kids in schools.  You could call it the bad
case  anecdotes about yes, my child has been told by all the  people who
evaluated her, that if you can only have the lap  top in the classroom, her
problems would be solved, but I  can't get my school to let her take it.</P>
<P>That's the other environment that we work in, is  the disabled encountering
the environments, and coming to  somebody in the health care field and saying,
we're not  matching.</P>
<P>MS. ADLER:  That is the essence of the debate  around the 2000 census
questions.  The disability community  wants to look at the environment, not just
medical aspects.   The disability survey was designed -- by the time the 
questionnaires were put together, that was four or five  years ago, which is
almost a generation.</P>
<P>In the phase two interview there is an extensive  section written by David
Piper on work accommodations and  employment accommodations.  It is very good
for its time.   There is also a really detailed section on assisted devices  for
adults and children.  That will help particularly with  employment.  There is
some information on the environment  for children.</P>
<P>You are right, we do need to develop measures of  the environment whenever
we talk about disability.  In the  future, just having the questions sensory
impairment and the  ADLs is not going to mean a whole lot without the 
accompanying questions not only on the environment, but on  the particular
individual's accessibility to the  environment.</P>
<P>DR. AMARO:  In one of our major topics that we  chose to deal with Medicaid
managed care, I was wondering if  there was any information available about the
availability  and actual use of all this technology that improves  functioning
and participation in the world by people across  socio-economic status,
geographic areas?</P>
<P>It's sort of theoretically available, but is it  really available?  How many
people's lives are really being  improved by all this technology?  I think that
would be a  relevant question.</P>
<P>DR. MOR:  The data are available on the HDIS,  because you do have, because
of the phase one supplement, in  particular for 1994 -- it wasn't done in 1995
as well, the  health insurance component -- which otherwise is not  possible to
get from the HIS what short-term insurance  coverage is for the overall
population, but you can for this  1994 group.  That's 70,000 individuals?</P>
<P>MS. ADLER:  One hundred and seven thousand.</P>
<P>DR. MOR:  So for 107,000, some proportion of those  people will be Medicaid
recipients.</P>
<P>DR. AMARO:  Medicaid managed care?</P>
<P>DR. MOR:  No, it won't deal with Medicaid managed  care, but the question
you are asking is really what's the  accessibility I think of these kinds of
devices.</P>
<P>DR. AMARO:  That, and what's the impact of managed  care going to be, the
accessibility.</P>
<P>MS. ADLER:  Probably the easiest way to look at it  is a phase one in the
ADL questions, and I can't remember if  we did it for the IADL, but to find out
if someone can do  the activity for example, bathing, by themselves, with 
special equipment, or they need to be reminded or supervised  and all these
combinations.  Then how difficult is it with  these various combinations, and
what assisted devices are  used.  So you are going to measure for example, with 
bathing, how many use an assisted device for that.</P>
<P>In phase two, the ADL questions are repeated, and  in different kinds of
therapy and services, and the devices  grouped together to find out how much did
the person pay out  of pocket.  Find out if Medicaid paid for it.  Are there any
 unmet needs.  For example, if you didn't have it, did you  need it?  It's not
direct.  You have to kind of go around  and about.</P>
<P>DR. IEZZONI:  I think Hortensia's question is  prospectively.  Going forward
from this point, are we going  to have data systems that will allow us to
monitor on an  ongoing basis, whether persons in Medicaid managed care get  the
assisted technologies that they need?  Especially as you  described very
eloquently, Michelle, that the assisted  technologies now can do many, many
things that even a year  or two or three ago they couldn't do.</P>
<P>So that is something that we should be thinking  about.  This is just a
reminder that we will be having that  meeting the last week in September to try
to finalize what  we want to focus on in the Medicaid managed care project.</P>
<P>Any final questions?  I really want to thank our  speakers.  This has been
extremely informative.  I think  that there are a few things that I would like
to follow-up  on.  I would like to make sure that we get the Federal  Register
notice when the census questions come out, because  I think that we would like
to be able to respond to those.</P>
<P>We should definitely at least look at the IOM  findings about the disability
evaluation study, and see  whether we could add our voice in just confirmation
in some  of the issues that have been raised.</P>
<P>I think we will help Paul about whether Barbara  Starfield's committee on
data standards might want to think  jointly about looking further into coding
for functional  status issues.</P>
<P>So this has been very helpful.  Does anybody else  have any final comments? 
Wisdom for us from the panelists?   No.</P>
<P>Well, thank you very much for spending Monday  after with us.  Thank you.</P>
<P>[Whereupon the meeting was recessed at 4:45 p.m.,  to reconvene in full
session the following day, Tuesday,  September 8, 1997 at 9:00 a.m.]</P></BODY></HTML>
