<P>
This publication presents the estimates of personal income and per capita
personal income for 1969&#8211;92 for local areas&ndash;that is, for metropolitan
areas and counties; these estimates were prepared by the Regional Economic
Measurement Division of the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). It also presents
estimates for the United States, for the eight BEA regions, and for the States.
In addition, it presents the Census Bureau's annual estimates of population
that were used in the derivation of the estimates of per capita personal
income.
<P>
The estimates are supplemented by maps and charts. A map of the United States
presents the per capita personal income for 1992 for each region, and a map
of each State shows the metropolitan areas and counties in the State. Two
charts are shown for each State: One chart presents the total personal income
of each metropolitan area in the State, and the other presents the per capita
personal income of the State and of the metropolitan and the nonmetropolitan
portions of the State.
<P>
The estimates of personal income and of per capita personal income reflect
the revised national estimates of personal income that resulted from the
1991 comprehensive revision and the 1992 and 1993 annual revisions of the
national income and product accounts. The revised national estimates were
incorporated into the State estimates of personal income as part of a
comprehensive revision in August 1992 and into the local area estimates of
personal income as part of a comprehensive revision in May 1993. In addition,
the estimates incorporate source data that were not available in time to
be used in the comprehensive revisions.<A HREF="#fn1">(1)</A>
<P>
The estimates are first prepared for the Nation and for States and counties.
The estimates for the regions are aggregations of the State estimates, and
the estimates for the metropolitan areas are aggregations of the county
estimates. As a result of this building-block approach, the estimates for
metropolitan areas, whose boundaries may change, can be presented on the
basis of consistent geographic definitions.
<P>
The definitions of metropolitan areas that BEA uses for the estimates were
issued by the Office of Management and Budget for Federal statistical purposes
in June 1993. These areas consist of 240 metropolitan statistical areas,
58 primary metropolitan statistical areas (PMSA's), and 12 New England county
metropolitan areas (NECMA's); in addition, the PMSA's and a NECMA are grouped
in 17 consolidated metropolitan statistical areas.<A HREF="#fn2">(2)</A>
<P>
BEA does not prepare estimates for all counties and county equivalents, because
the geographic coding of essential source data for a few counties and county
equivalents has proved to be unreliable. Accordingly, the source data for
each of the following areas are combined with the source data for an adjacent
county, and the estimates are then prepared for the combined areas: The small
independent cities of Virginia&ndash;generally those with fewer than 100,000
residents; Kalawao County, Hawaii; the Montana portion of Yellowstone National
Park; and Menominee County, Wisconsin.
<P>
This introduction presents a brief history of the development of the estimates
of personal income. It describes the uses of the local area estimates and
the schedule for preparing and revising the estimates, and it presents
information about the availability of the estimates and about the BEA User
Group.
<p><h2 id="history">
  A brief history
</h2>
<P>
In the mid-1930's, BEA began work on the estimation of regional income as
part of the effort to explain the processes and structure of the Nation's
economy. As a result, it produced annual State estimates of total "income
payments to individuals." These income payments were calculated as the sum
of (1) wages and salaries, (2) other labor income and relief, (3) entrepreneurial
withdrawals, and (4) dividends, interest, and net rents and royalties.
<P>
During the 1940's and early 1950's, BEA developed an integrated set of national
economic accounts, sought additional source data, and improved the methods
used to prepare the estimates. One result of this work was the development
of State personal income&ndash;a measure that is more comprehensive than State
income payments.
<P>
State personal income differs significantly from State income payments in
five ways:
<OL>
  <LI>
    State personal income consists of six major components (other labor income
    and transfer payments replaced other labor income and relief, and the component
    personal contributions for social insurance was added as an explicit deduction);
  <LI>
    Personal income includes more component detail and a broader range of
    income-in-kind and imputed income items than State income payments;
  <LI>
    Personal income includes the income of nonprofit institutions and of private
    noninsured welfare funds and private trust funds;
  <LI>
    Personal income includes employer contributions to private pension funds&ndash;as
    part of other labor income&ndash;instead of the benefits paid by the funds;
    and
  <LI>
    Personal income includes transfer payments by business.
</OL>
<P>
In addition, in the mid-1950's, BEA began work on preparing estimates for
local areas. It prepared estimates for a few counties in the States in the
Mideast and Plains regions.
<P>
In the late 1950's, BEA developed estimates of State disposable personal
income. This series was published occasionally in the <em>Survey of Current Business</em>
 in the 1960's and 1970's and
has been presented annually beginning with 1982.
<P>
During the 1960's, BEA developed quarterly estimates of State personal income.
The first set of these estimates as a continuous series was published in
the December 1966 issue of the <em>Survey</em><em>Survey</em>. In addition, BEA prepared
a personal income series for metropolitan areas and for nonmetropolitan counties
for selected years of 1929&#8211;62.
<P>
In the early 1970's, BEA developed the estimates of personal income for counties
in metropolitan areas. These estimates were published for the first time
in the April 1975 <em>Survey</em>. Later in the 1970's it developed
estimates of employment for States, counties, and metropolitan areas.
<P>
In the 1980's, it developed estimates of gross State product by industry;
the first presentation of these estimates as an established series was in
the May 1988 <em>Survey</em>.
<P>
Now, BEA prepares annual and quarterly estimates of State personal income
and annual estimates of State disposable personal income and employment and
of gross State product. It also prepares annual estimates of personal income
and employment for all metropolitan areas and all the counties and county
equivalents for which reliable source data are available.
<h2 id="Uses">
  Uses of the local area estimates
</h2>
<P>
Both the public and the private sectors use the estimates of personal income
for counties and metropolitan areas to measure and to track the levels and
the types of income received by the persons who live or work in a county
or metropolitan area. In addition, both sectors use the estimates of personal
income and of employment to evaluate the socioeconomic impact of their
initiatives; for example, they use the estimates to prepare the environmental
impact statements required by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.
<P>
Federal agencies use these estimates in economic models to evaluate program
needs and as a framework for economic analysis.
<P>
State governments use the estimates to measure the economic base of State
planning areas and in economic models that are developed for planning. They
also use the estimates to project tax revenues and the need for public utilities
and services.
<P>
University schools of business and economics use the estimates for theoretical
and applied economic research. Some schools publish the estimates in abstracts
or similar reports, which are distributed to State and local government agencies,
regional councils, private research groups, businesses, and libraries.
<P>
Businesses use the estimates to evaluate markets for new or established products
and to determine areas for the location, expansion, and contraction of their
activities. Trade associations and labor organizations also use the estimates
to analyze markets for products and labor.
<p><h2 id="Schedule>
  <A NAME="schedule"></A>Schedule for preparing and revising the estimates 
</h2>
<P>
<strong>Annual estimates.</strong>&ndash;The annual estimates of total and per
capita personal income and of total and per capita disposable personal income
for States for a given year are prepared in two steps. First, in April,
preliminary estimates for the preceding year that are derived from the quarterly
estimates for that year are prepared. Second, in August, the preliminary
estimates are superseded by estimates that are more detailed and more reliable
because they are derived from source data that are more complete, more detailed,
and more recent than the data that were used to prepare the quarterly estimates
and the preliminary estimates.
<P>
The following April, the annual estimates for the year are revised in order
to incorporate the newly available data that are used to prepare the county
estimates of personal income for that year.
<P>
The annual estimates for a year are routinely revised again for 2 more years.
The State estimates are revised in August and in April, and the county estimates
are revised in April; each revision incorporates newly available source data.
These routine revisions are completed 3 years after the preliminary State
estimates were prepared and 2 years after the county estimates were prepared.
<P>
The State and county estimates are normally revised again only after a
comprehensive, or benchmark, revision of the national income and product
accounts (NIPA's) that results in the comprehensive revision of the national
estimates of personal income, which is an aggregate in the NIPA's; comprehensive
revisions to the NIPA's are made approximately every 5
years.<A HREF="#fn3">(3)</A> The revised national estimates are incorporated
into the State and county estimates as part of the comprehensive revision
of the State estimates and of the county estimates, because the State and
county estimates are designed to be statistically and conceptually consistent
with the national estimates.
<P>
In a benchmark NIPA revision, the national estimates of personal income are
affected by the statistical changes that result from the introduction of
new source data and the use of improved estimating methods. The national
estimates may also be affected by the changes made to the definitions and
the classifications of the NIPA components so that the NIPA's will reflect
the evolving economy of the United States. For example, as part of the 1985
benchmark revision, the payments to vendors of medical services under the
medicaid program were reclassified from government purchases to transfer
payments; as a result, these payments were added to personal income.
<P>
<strong>Quarterly estimates.</strong>&ndash;The quarterly estimates of State
personal income are prepared about 4 months after the end of the quarter.
In January and in July, the estimates for specific quarters are revised to
incorporate administrative-records data for wage and salary disbursements.
In January, the estimates for the second quarter of the preceding year are
revised, and the estimates for one or more preceding quarters may also be
revised. In July, the estimates for the fourth quarter of the preceding year
are revised, and the estimates for one or more preceding quarters may also
be revised.
<P>
In April and in October, the quarterly estimates for the previous 3 years
are revised so that they will be consistent with the revised annual estimates.
<h2 id="Availability">
  Availability of the State and local area estimates
</h2>
<P>
The quarterly State estimates of total and nonfarm personal income are published
in the January, April, July, and October issues of the S<SMALL>URVEY OF</SMALL>
C<SMALL>URRENT</SMALL> B<SMALL>USINESS</SMALL>.
<P>
The preliminary annual State estimates of total and per capita personal income
and of total and per capita disposable personal income are published in the
April <em>Survey</em>. The revised annual estimates of State personal
income by major type and of earnings by industry are published in the August
<em>Survey</em>.
<P>
The local area estimates of total and per capita personal income are published
in the April <em>Survey</em>.<A HREF="#fn4">(4)</A>
<P>
Before the State and local area estimates are published in the
<em>Survey</em>, they are available in news releases and on the Department
of Commerce's Economic Bulletin Board.<A HREF="#fn5">(5)</A> More detailed
estimates than the estimates published in the <em>Survey</em> are available
from the Regional Economic Information System (REIS).<A HREF="#fn6">(6)</A>
The following local area estimates are available from REIS:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Personal income by type of income (for example, wages and salaries) and earnings
    (the sum of wages and salaries, other labor income, and proprietors' income)
    by Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) two-digit industry for counties
    and metropolitan areas,
  <LI>
    Employment, which includes part-time jobs and self-employment, by SIC division
    (the "one-digit" level of classification) for counties and metropolitan areas,
  <LI>
    Transfer payments by major program for counties and metropolitan areas, and
  <LI>
    Farm income and expenses, including broad categories of gross receipts and
    expenses of all farms and four measures of net farm income, for counties.
</UL>
<P>
In addition, the State and local area estimates of personal income and of
employment are available from the BEA User Group. The members of this group
include State agencies, universities, and Census Bureau Primary State Data
Centers.<A HREF="#fn7">(7)</A> The members have agreed to provide the estimates
that they receive from REIS to other users in their State. The members can
usually provide the State and the local area estimates for their State.

  <p><h2 id="Sources and Methods">
    The Sources and Methods for the Annual Estimates of Local Area Personal Income
    for 1987&#8211;92
  </h2>

<P>
This text describes the sources of the data and the methods that were used
to prepare the annual estimates of the components of personal income for
counties for 1987&#8211;92. The information about the characteristics of the
county estimates and the data and the methods used to prepare the estimates
also applies to the estimates for metropolitan areas because the estimate
for a metropolitan area is the sum of the estimates of its constituent counties.
<P>
The introduction describes the relationship between the national estimates
of personal income and the State and county estimates, it defines the essential
terms used, and it explains a few differences between the definitions and
classifications used in the national estimates and those used in the State
and county estimates. This introduction also includes general information
about the sources of the data that are used to prepare the estimates and
the place of measurement of the source data. Additionally, it includes
information about the allocation procedure and a brief description of the
interpolation and extrapolation procedures.
<P>
After the introduction, the text provides specific information about each
of the components of personal income and about the residence adjustment.

  <h2 id="intro">
    Introduction
  </h2>

<P>
The State and county estimates of personal income are designed to be conceptually
and statistically consistent with the national estimates of personal income;
as part of the preparation of the State and county estimates, the national
estimates are disaggregated to States and counties.<A HREF="#fn8">(8)</A>
As a result, the definitions that are used for the components of personal
income for the State and county estimates are essentially the same as those
used for the national estimates.<A HREF="#fn9">(9)</A>
<P>
The personal income of an area is defined as the income received by, or on
behalf of, all the residents of the area. It consists of the income received
by persons from all sources&ndash;that is, from participation in production,
from both government and business transfer payments, and from government
interest (which is treated like a transfer payment).
<P>
Persons consists of individuals, nonprofit institutions that serve individuals,
private noninsured welfare funds, and private trust funds. The last three
are referred to as "quasi-individuals."
<P>
Personal income is calculated as the sum of wage and salary disbursements,
other labor income, proprietors' income with inventory valuation and capital
consumption adjustments, rental income of persons with capital consumption
adjustment, personal dividend income, personal interest income, and transfer
payments to persons, less personal contributions for social insurance.
<P>
Per capita personal income is calculated as the personal income of the residents
of an area divided by the population of the area.
<p><strong>
  <A NAME="diffdefn"></A>Differences in definitions and classifications
</strong>
<P>
The definitions that are used in the State and county estimates for two
components of personal income and for one supplementary aggregation of three
components differ significantly from the definitions that are used in the
national estimates. In addition, the classifications that are used for one
component in the State and county estimates differ significantly from those
used in the national estimates.
<P>
The State and county estimates of farm income consist of farm earnings&ndash;that
is, the sum of wages and salaries, other labor income, and proprietors' income.
The national estimates of farm income consist of farm earnings and agricultural
net interest.
<P>
The State and county estimates of wage and salary disbursements and of other
labor income consist mainly of the labor earnings of persons who reside and
who work in the United States. However, the national estimates of these
components also include the earnings of U.S. residents who are temporarily
working abroad for the U.S. Government or for U.S. firms.
<P>
The adjustment to the estimates of wages and salaries to include the wages
and salaries of U.S. residents who work in other countries and to exclude
the wages and salaries of foreign residents who work in the United States
is classified in the residence adjustment in the State and county
estimates.<A HREF="#fn10">(10)</A> In the national estimates, this adjustment
is classified in the rest-of-the-world sector, which is not recognized in
the State and local area estimates.
<P>
In addition, in the State and county estimates, the wages and salaries of
U.S. residents who are employed by international organizations and by foreign
embassies and consulates in the United States are classified in an "industry"
called "other." In the national estimates, the wages of these residents are
classified in the rest-of-the-world sector.
<p><strong>
  <A NAME="datasource"></A>Sources of the data 
</strong>
<P>
About 90 percent of the State and county estimates of personal income are
based on census data and on administrative-records data that are collected
by others. The data from censuses are mainly collected from the recipient
of the income. The most important sources of census data for the State and
county estimates are the census of agriculture and the census of population
and housing that are conducted by the Bureau of the Census, Department of
Commerce.
<P>
The data from administrative records may originate either from the recipients
of the income or from the source of the income. These data are a byproduct
of the administration of various Federal and State government programs. The
most important sources of these data are as follows: The State unemployment
insurance programs of the Employment and Training Administration, Department
of Labor; the social insurance programs of the Social Security Administration
and the Health Care Financing Administration, Department of Health and Human
Services; the Federal income tax program of the Internal Revenue Service,
Department of the Treasury; the veterans benefit programs of the Department
of Veterans Affairs; and the military payroll systems of the Department of
Defense.<A HREF="#fn11">(11)</A>
<P>
About 10 percent of the estimates are based on data from other sources. For
example, the estimates of the components of farm proprietors' income, a component
of personal income, are partly based on the State estimates of farm income
and the county estimates of cash receipts, crop production, and livestock
inventory that are prepared by the Department of Agriculture, which uses
sample surveys, along with census data and administrative-records data, to
derive its estimates.
<P>
Using census data, administrative-records data, and other data that are not
primarily designed to measure income has both advantages and disadvantages.
Using these data, BEA can prepare detailed annual estimates of personal income
for States and counties at a relatively low cost and without increasing the
reporting burden on businesses and households. However, because these data
are not primarily designed to measure income, they often do not precisely
"match" the series that is being estimated; therefore, they must be adjusted
to compensate for differences in definitions, in coverage, and in geographic
detail.
<p><strong>
  <A NAME="place"></A>Place of measurement of the source data 
</strong>
<P>
Personal income, by definition, is a measure of the income received by persons;
therefore, the estimates of State and county personal income should reflect
the State and county of the residence of the income recipients. However,
most of the source data that are used to prepare the estimates of some of
the components of personal income are reported and recorded by the recipient's
place of work rather than by the recipient's place of residence. As a result,
the estimates of the components that are derived from the place-of-work data
are adjusted to a place-of-residence basis, and the estimates of these components
are presented both by place of work and by place of residence.
<P>
The estimates of the components of personal income can be grouped according
to the place of measurement of the source data.
<P>
The estimates of wages and salaries, other labor income, and personal
contributions for social insurance by employees are mainly derived from source
data that are reported and recorded by place of work. These data are reported
by industry in the State and county in which the employing establishment
is located.
<P>
The estimates of nonfarm proprietors' income and of personal contributions
for social insurance by the self-employed are derived from source data that
are reported by the tax-filing address of the recipient. This address is
usually that of the proprietors' residence; therefore, these data are assumed
to be recorded by place of residence. However, the estimates of these
components&ndash;as part of the estimates of earnings&ndash;are presented both
by place of residence and by place of work. If the State or county of residence
differs from the State or county of work, then the estimates of earnings
by place of work are more likely to be misstated than the estimates of earnings
by place of residence.
<P>
The estimates of farm proprietors' income are derived from source data that
are reported and recorded by the principal place of production, which is
usually the county in which the farm has most of its land and in which most
of the work is performed. Because most farm proprietors live on, or near,
their land, the place of residence is assumed to be the same as the place
of work.
<P>
The estimates of rental income of persons, personal dividend income, personal
interest income, transfer payments, and personal contributions for supplementary
medical insurance and for veterans life insurance are derived from source
data that are reported and recorded by the place of residence of the income
recipient.
<p><strong>
  Allocation procedures
</strong>
<P>
Using the allocation procedures imparts to the State and local area estimates
the characteristics of the national estimates that are not reflected in the
available State- and county-level source data; for most components of personal
income, the State and county source data are less comprehensive and less
reliable than the data that are available for the national
estimates.<A HREF="#fn12">(12)</A> In addition, using these procedures allows
the use of State and county data that are available in economic series that
are related to, but that do not precisely match, the component being estimated.
<P>
Before the State and county estimates are prepared, the national estimates
of some components of personal income are adjusted for the differences in
definitions and classifications between the national estimates and the State
estimates. The adjusted national estimates of these components and the national
estimates of the other components are used as the "control totals" for the
State estimates, and the State estimates are then used as control totals
for the county estimates.
<P>
In the allocation procedures, the national control total for each component
is allocated to the States in proportion to each State's share of a related
economic series. Similarly, the State control total is allocated to the counties
in proportion to each county's share of a related economic series. The related
series may be the source data, or it may be preliminary estimates that are
derived from the source data and that are calculated as the sum of several
items (for example, wages, tips, and pay-in-kind) or as the product of two
items (for example, average wages times the number of employees) or that
are interpolated or extrapolated from the source data or from other estimates.
<P>
Because the allocation procedures use the national control totals for the
State estimates and the State control totals for the county estimates, its
use yields an additive system in which the State estimates sum to the national
estimate, and the estimates for the counties in a State sum to the State
estimate.
<P>
The allocation procedure used to estimate a component of State personal income
is
<P>
Ys = (Yn)(Xs/Xn)
<P>
where <em>Ys</em> is the estimator (that is, the statistical procedure used
to derive an estimate) of the component of personal income for State
<em>s</em>, where <em>Yn</em> is the national estimate of the component (which
is used as the control total for the State estimates of the component), where
<em>Xs</em> is the datum for State <em>s</em> from the economic series related
to the component, and where <em>Xn</em> is the national sum of the State data
from the economic series related to the component <em>(Xn = "SUM" Xs)</em>.
<P>
In the cases in which the national estimate is calculated as the sum of the
State data plus an amount <em>An</em> for which State data are unavailable,
the allocation procedure may be represented by two equations (which together
are mathematically identical to the preceding equation):
<P>
As = (An)(Xs/Xn)<BR>
Ys = Xs + As
<P>
where <em>As</em> is the State estimator of the portion of <em>Y</em> for which
State data are unavailable. In effect, <em>Ys</em> is the composite estimator
consisting of <em>Xs</em>, the best possible direct estimator (100 percent
sample) of the portion of <em>Y</em> for which State data are available, plus
<em>As</em>, the indirect estimator of the portion of <em>Y</em> for which State
data are unavailable.
<P>
For example, the national estimates of wages and salaries for many industries
consist of the sum of State data plus a few small adjustments, which taken
together (<em>An</em>) are allocated to the States in proportion to the State
data. The small allocated amount for each State (<em>As</em>) is added to the
State datum (<em>Xs</em>) to yield the State estimate (<em>Ys</em>).
<p><strong>
  Interpolation and extrapolation procedures
</strong>
<P>
Some of the data that are used to estimate components of State and county
personal income are available or adequate only in benchmark years. In order
to derive the estimates of these components for other years, interpolation
and extrapolation procedures are used to extend the distribution of the data
for the benchmark year or years.
<P>
Interpolation procedures are used in the derivation of the estimates for
the years between 2 benchmark years. Extrapolation procedures are used in
the derivation of the estimates for the years after the most recent benchmark
year.
<P>
For the details of these procedures, see <A HREF="#interpol">page
M&#8211;34</A> in the "Technical Notes."

  <p><strong>
    <A NAME="disburse"></A>Wage and Salary Disbursements 
  </strong>

<P>
Wage and salary disbursements are defined as the monetary remuneration of
employees. This remuneration includes the compensation of corporate officers;
commissions, tips, and bonuses; voluntary employee contributions to certain
deferred compensation plans, such as 401(k) plans; and receipts in kind,
or pay-in-kind, that represent income (see
<A HREF="#payinkind">"Pay-in-kind"</A> on page M&#8211;36 in the "Technical
Notes").
<P>
Wage and salary disbursements are measured before deductions, such as social
security contributions and union dues, and they reflect the amount of wages
and salaries disbursed, but not necessarily earned, during the year. The
estimates are prepared, with a few exceptions, at the Standard Industrial
Classification (SIC) two-digit level.
<P>
Wage and salary disbursements accounted for about 58 percent of total personal
income at the national level in 1992 (see <A HREF="tableA.cfm">table
A</A>, which also shows the relationship of the major components of wages
and salaries to total personal income).
<P>
The State and county estimates of about 98 percent of wages and salaries
for approximately 70 private industries, for Federal Government civilian
employees, and for State and local government employees are based on the
data that are summarized by county and by SIC four-digit industry on form
ES-202 by the State employment security agencies
(ESA's).<A HREF="#fn13">(13)</A> The summarized data are from quarterly State
unemployment insurance (UI) contribution reports that are filed with an ESA
by the employers in the industries that are covered by, and subject to, that
State's UI laws. Under most of these laws, wages and salaries include bonuses,
tips, and the cash value of meals and lodging provided by the employer&ndash;that
is, pay-in-kind.<A HREF="#fn14">(14)</A>
<P>
The estimates of wages and salaries for three SIC two-digit industries are
based on the ES-202 data that are available and on other data, because these
three industries&ndash;agricultural services, private education, and religious
membership organizations&ndash;are only partially covered by State UI programs.
The ES-202 data at the SIC three-digit level for each of these industries
are divided into the fully covered portion and the incompletely covered portion,
which is based on the ES-202 data, and (2) the incompletely covered portion,
which is primarily based on other data.
<P>
The estimates of wages and salaries for SIC two- and three-digit industries
that are not covered by UI programs or that are fully covered in only a few
States are primarily based on data other than ES-202 data. The data on which
these estimates are based are specified in the relevant section.
<P>
The sources of data and the methods that are used to prepare the estimates
of wage and salary disbursements are described in two sections: Wages and
salaries that are covered by the UI programs and wages and salaries that
are not covered by the UI programs.
<p><strong>
  Wages and salaries covered by the UI programs
</strong>
<P>
The estimates of wages and salaries that are covered by the State UI programs
or by the UI program for Federal civilian employees are based on ES-202 data
for quarterly wages and salaries, or payrolls. However, these data do not
precisely meet BEA's statistical and conceptual requirements; therefore,
the data must be adjusted. These adjustments affect both the industrial and
the geographic patterns of State and county personal income.
<P>
<strong>Adjustment for industry nonclassification.</strong>&ndash;The industry
detail of the ES-202 data regularly shows minor amounts of payroll&ndash;only
about 0.2 percent of total payrolls nationally&ndash;that have not been assigned
to any industry. The industrial classification scheme used by BEA does not
permit this not-elsewhere-classified category. Therefore, for each State
and county, the amount in this category is distributed among the industries
in proportion to the industry-classified ES-202 payrolls. Because this adjustment
only apportions the amount reported for a county within that county, no error
is introduced into the total estimate for the county.
<P>
<strong>Adjustment for statewide reporting.</strong>&ndash;A State UI contribution
report is usually filed for each establishment by industry and by county;
however, a report may be filed by an employer for a group of very small
establishments by State, not by county. Therefore, county data are unavailable
for these establishments.
<P>
The State totals of the wages and salaries reported for these statewide units
for an industry are allocated to counties in proportion to the distribution
of the wages and salaries for the industry that is reported by county. The
statewide totals are allocated for each private-sector industry (generally
at the SIC two-digit level) and for five government components&ndash;Federal
civilian, State education, State noneducation, local education, and local
noneducation.
<P>
<strong>Adjustment for misreported wage and salary data.</strong>&ndash;An estimate
of the wages and salaries that were not reported in the UI contribution reports
is added to the ES-202 data for each private industry. Because State and
county data are unavailable, the national estimate for each industry is allocated
to States and counties in proportion to the ES-202 payroll data for the industry.
<P>
The national estimate for each industry is prepared in two parts. One part
is prepared for the payrolls that were underreported, and one part is prepared
for the payrolls that were not reported because employers failed to file
a report.<A HREF="#fn15">(15)</A>
<P>
In addition, it is assumed that tips are unreported by specific industries.
Therefore, estimates of the tips are added to the ES-202 data for the following
industries: Taxicabs, which is part of local and interurban passenger transit;
eating and drinking places; hotels and other lodging places; amusement and
recreation services; and personal services. Because State and county data
are unavailable, the national estimate for each industry is allocated to
States and counties in proportion to the ES-202 payroll data for the industry.
<P>
<strong>Adjustments for Federal civilian payrolls.</strong>&ndash;Large proportions
of the ES-202 data for the wages and salaries of the civilian employees of
most Federal Government agencies in Tennessee and of a few agencies in New
York, Virginia, and Wisconsin are reported by State, not by county. Therefore,
the county estimates of the wages and salaries of these employees are derived
from employment data provided by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).
<P>
In Tennessee, the State estimates of the wages and salaries of the civilian
employees of all agencies except the Tennessee Valley Authority are allocated
to the counties by the OPM employment data. The State estimates of the wages
and salaries of the civilian employees of the Postal Service in New York,
the Department of Defense in Virginia and Wisconsin, and the U.S. Forest
Service and the Farmers' Home Administration in Wisconsin are allocated to
the counties in each State in proportion to the OPM employment data for each
agency.
<P>
In addition, in the ES-202 data, all of the wages and salaries of congressional
staff are assigned to Washington, DC, although some of these staff work in
the State offices of the members of Congress. BEA assumes that 25 percent
of the total congressional payrolls are earned by congressional staff in
State offices; therefore, this percentage of the payrolls are allocated to
States in proportion to their congressional representation. The State estimate
of this adjustment&ndash;together with the State estimate of wages and salaries
for all Federal civilian employees&ndash;is allocated to counties in proportion
to the ES-202 payroll data or the OPM employment data.
<P>
<strong>Adjustment for a component of State government
payrolls.</strong>&ndash;The geographic coding of the ES-202 data for the
noneducation component of State government payrolls appears to attribute
too much of the payrolls to the counties of the State capitals in six States.
Therefore, data from the 1980 and 1990 Census of Population are used in the
preparation of the county estimates of the wages and salaries for these
employees.
<P>
The county estimates of the wages and salaries for the noneducation component
for Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Tennessee, and Wisconsin
are based on data for the wages and salaries of State government employees
in noneducation by place of work; these data are derived from unpublished
tabulations of journey-to-work data from the censuses. The estimates for
1987&#8211;89 were derived from straight-line interpolations of the data for
1980 and for 1990. The estimates for 1990&#8211;92 are based on the 1990 data.
<P>
<strong>Adjustments for elements that are excluded from the ES-202
data.</strong>&ndash;The ES-202 payroll data for specific SIC two- and three-digit
industries exclude small portions of the wages in those industries either
because the employing establishments are not covered by the UI programs or
because a portion of the establishments' payrolls are not subject to UI
reporting. The following procedure is used to prepare the State and county
estimates for the industries that include these noncovered elements.
<P>
A national estimate of each element is prepared, and then it is allocated
to States on the basis of the best available related economic series. The
State estimate of the element is added to the ES-202 payroll data for the
industry of the element in order to augment the State data on which the State
estimates for that industry are based. Then, the national estimate for the
industry is allocated to States in proportion to the augmented ES-202 data.
<P>
Because county data for the noncovered elements are unavailable, the State
estimates are allocated to the counties in proportion to the unaugmented
ES-202 data.
<P>
This procedure is used to prepare the State and county estimates of the following
elements in the following industries:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Payrolls of electric railroads&ndash;that is, commuter lines&ndash;which are
    classified in local and interurban passenger transit, payrolls of railroad
    carrier affiliates, which are classified in transportation services, and
    payrolls of railway labor organizations, classified in membership organizations
    other than religious;
  <LI>
    Payrolls of nonprofit organizations that are exempt from UI coverage because
    they have fewer than four employees&ndash;in printing and publishing,
    miscellaneous manufacturing, credit agencies other than banks, real estate,
    holding and other investment companies, hotels, and membership organizations
    other than religious;
  <LI>
    Commissions received by insurance solicitors and real estate agents;
  <LI>
    Salaries of corporate officers in Washington State;
  <LI>
    Wages and salaries of students employed by the institutions of higher education
    in which they are enrolled, which are classified in private education, State
    government education, and local government education;
  <LI>
    Pay-in-kind of the members of religious orders who teach at private colleges
    and universities but who do not receive cash wages;
  <LI>
    Pay-in-kind of workers in private hospitals who do not receive cash wages
    (mainly interns, student nurses, and members of religious orders);
  <LI>
    Allowances paid to Federal civilian employees in selected occupations for
    uniforms; and
  <LI>
    Salaries of elected officials and members of the judiciary in State and local
    governments.
</UL>
<p><strong>
  Wages and salaries not covered by the State UI programs
</strong>
<P>
The estimates of wages and salaries for eight industries are primarily based
on data other than ES-202 data. The ES-202 data are inadequate for five
industries&ndash;farms, farm labor contractors, private households, private
elementary and secondary schools, and religious membership
organizations&ndash;because these industries are extensively covered by State
UI programs in only a few States. The ES-202 data are unavailable for three
industries&ndash;railroads, military, and "other"&ndash;because these industries
are not covered by State UI programs.<A HREF="#fn16">(16)</A> Consequently,
the wages and salaries of all eight industries are treated as if they were
not covered by State UI programs. In addition, because these estimates are
primarily based on data that do not include wages paid in kind, an estimate
of pay-in-kind is prepared for all of these industries except farm labor
contractors, railroads, and "other."
<P>
<strong>Farms.</strong>&ndash;The estimates of wages and salaries for farms consist
of the salaries of officers of corporate farms and the cash wages and the
pay-in-kind of hired farm labor. The State and county estimates of corporate
officers' salaries are based primarily on the salaries of corporate officers
from the 1987 Census of Agriculture.
<P>
The State estimates of the cash wages of hired farm labor are based on the
estimates of farm labor expenses that are prepared by the Department of
Agriculture. In order to prepare the county estimates, the estimates for
most States are allocated to counties by distributions of the wages paid
to farm employees from the 1987 census.
<P>
However, farm employees have either mandatory UI coverage or almost complete
voluntary coverage in the following States: Arizona, California, Connecticut,
Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and
Washington. Therefore, the county estimates of cash wages for these States
are derived from ES-202 data.
<P>
The State estimates of pay-in-kind are based on estimates prepared by the
Department of Agriculture. The State estimates are allocated to counties
in proportion to the number of hired farm workers who worked 150 days or
more in 1987 from the 1987 census.
<P>
<strong>Farm labor contractors.</strong>&ndash;This industry is classified in
agricultural services. Farm labor contractors and their employees are only
partially covered by UI laws in most States. However, in California and Florida,
all the employees in this industry are covered, and in Arizona, about 80
percent are covered.
<P>
The State and county estimates for most States are based on the data for
contract farm labor expenses from the 1987 Census of Agriculture. For California,
Florida, and Arizona, the census-based estimates are compared with the ES-202
payroll data. If the ES-202 amounts are higher than the census-based estimates,
the ES-202 amounts are substituted for the census-based estimates.
<P>
<strong>Railroads.</strong>&ndash;The railroad industry is covered by the Railroad
Unemployment Insurance system that is administered by the Railroad Retirement
Board, which does not require interstate railroads to submit data by State.
An employment series developed from the biennial reports on employment in
Class I railroads from the Association of American Railroads is used as the
principal basis for the State and county estimates of wages and salaries
for railroads.<A HREF="#fn17">(17)</A> These reports provide information
on employment by railroad company for each State, for selected metropolitan
counties that account for almost 90 percent of all railroad employment, and
for a residual of all the other counties in each State.
<P>
The estimates are prepared in six steps. First, straight-line interpolation
is used to prepare approximations of employment for the years between the
reports; approximations for the year or years after the most recent report
are prepared from the data from that report. Second, an approximation of
the wages for each company in an area is derived as the product of the employment
data for the company in the area and the national average wages for the company
reported annually to the Interstate Commerce Commission. Third, the
approximations of the wages of all the railroad companies in the area are
summed to produce a provisional estimate of the wages and salaries for the
area. Fourth, the provisional estimates are used in the allocation of the
national estimates of railroad wages and salaries to States and counties.
The national estimates are allocated to the States, and the State estimates
are allocated to the metropolitan counties and to the residual counties.
<P>
Fifth, an allocating series for the residual counties was prepared from 1980
and 1990 summations of railroad wages and salaries by place of work; the
1980 summations were derived from unpublished journey-to-work (JTW) data
from the 1980 Census of Population, and the 1990 summations, from unpublished
JTW data from the 1990 census. The allocators for the estimates for 1987&#8211;89
were derived by straight-line interpolation, and the 1990 summations were
used as the allocators for the 1990&#8211;92 estimates. Sixth, the State totals
for the residual counties were allocated to counties in proportion to the
JTW-based series.
<P>
<strong>Private households.</strong>&ndash;The national estimates of cash wages
for private households are allocated to States&ndash;d the State estimates,
to counties&ndash;in proportion to the series prepared from unpublished JTW
data. The State and county allocators for the 1987&#8211;89 estimates were
derived by straight-line interpolation between the 1980 summations and the
1990 summations of the JTW data for the wages and salaries of private household
employees by place of work, and the 1990 summations were used as the allocators
for the 1990 estimates. The 1990 summations for the States were extrapolated
to 1991&#8211;92 by the annual change in the civilian population, but the
1990 county summations were used as the county allocators for the 1991&#8211;92
estimates.
<P>
The national estimates of pay-in-kind are allocated to States and counties
by a place-of-work series for private household employment that is derived
from the JTW data.
<P>
<strong>Private elementary and secondary schools.</strong>&ndash;In about half
of the States, the county estimates of both cash wages and pay-in-kind are
derived from the best available series chosen from (1) data on employment
in private elementary and secondary schools published by the State departments
of education, (2) employment data from the U.S. Department of Education's
1980&#8211;81 survey of private elementary and secondary schools, or (3) relevant
wage data from the Census Bureau's annual <em>County Business Patterns
(CBP)</em>.<A HREF="#fn18">(18)</A>
<P>
In the other States, the UI coverage is complete enough so that the ES-202
data can be used as the basis for the county estimates. In these States,
the ES-202 distribution of wages and salaries is the basis for the estimates
of cash pay, and the ES-202 distribution of employment is the basis for the
estimates of pay-in-kind.
<P>
The State estimates of cash wages are based on the <em>CBP</em> data, which
are the data with the most uniform national coverage. The State estimates
of pay-in-kind reflect the number of full-time teachers in religious orders
from the <em>Official Catholic Directory (OCD)</em>.<A HREF="#fn19">(19)</A>
<P>
<strong>Religious membership organizations.</strong>&ndash;The State estimates
of cash wages are based on <em>CBP</em> data, and the estimates of pay-in-kind
are based on <em>OCD </em>data. However, the <em>CBP</em> county data are too
frequently suppressed to avoid disclosure of information about individual
organizations to be useful; therefore the State estimates are allocated to
counties in proportion to the distribution of the civilian population.
<P>
<strong>Military.</strong>&ndash;The estimates of wages and salaries for the
military consist of the estimates of the cash wages (including allowances)
of full-time military personnel and of the members of the military Reserves
including the National Guard and the estimates of the pay-in-kind provided
to enlisted personnel.<A HREF="#fn20">(20)</A>
<P>
The county estimates of wages and salaries are derived from source data from
the Department of Transportation for the Coast Guard and from the Department
of Defense for each of the other services. For military bases that extend
across county boundaries, source data by county are only available for Forts
Benning, Gordon, and Stewart, Georgia, for Wright-Patterson Air Force Base,
Ohio, and for Quantico Marine Corps Base, Virginia; the data for each of
the other intercounty bases are assigned to the county that contains the
base headquarters.
<P>
The State estimates of cash wages for full-time military personnel, which
are based mainly on payroll data, are allocated to counties in proportion
to the number of personnel for the Coast Guard and to the county payroll
estimates prepared by the Department of Defense for each of the other services.
<P>
The State estimates of cash pay for the Reserves are based on payroll data.
Because county payroll data are unavailable, the State estimates are allocated
to counties in proportion to the distribution of the civilian population.
<P>
The national estimate for the pay-in-kind of the full-time personnel of each
service is allocated to States and counties in proportion to the number of
enlisted personnel. The national estimate of the pay-in-kind of the Reserves
is allocated to States and counties in proportion to the estimates of cash
pay.
<P>
<strong>Other.</strong>&ndash;This category consists of the wages and salaries
of U.S. residents who are employed in the United States by international
organizations and by foreign embassies and
consulates.<A HREF="#fn21">(21)</A> The national estimate is allocated to
States and to counties in proportion to estimates of the administrative
expenditures of these organizations in 1968.<A HREF="#fn22">(22)</A>

  <p><strong>
    Other Labor Income
  </strong>

<P>
Other labor income consists of the payments by employers to privately
administered benefit plans for their employees, the fees paid to corporate
directors, and miscellaneous fees. The payments to private benefit plans
account for more than 98 percent of other labor
income.<A HREF="#fn23">(23)</A>
<P>
Other labor income accounted for approximately 6 percent of total personal
income at the national level in 1992 (<A HREF="tableB.cfm">table
B</A>).
<p><strong>
  Payments to private benefit plans
</strong>
<P>
The estimates of the payments by employers to privately administered benefit
plans consist of the payments to pension and profit-sharing plans, to private
group health and life insurance plans, and to supplemental unemployment benefit
plans and the payments by employers to privately administered workers'
compensation plans.
<P>
Pension and profit-sharing plans, group health and life insurance,
and supplemental unemployment insurance.&ndash;Most payments by employers
to private pension and profit-sharing plans are made on behalf of the employees
in private industry; some payments are made for Federal, State, and local
government employees, but most pensions for these employees are provided
through government-operated funds, which are classified as social insurance
in the national income and product accounts.
<P>
Payments for group health and life insurance are made for a majority of employees
in both the public and private sectors. Payments for supplemental unemployment
insurance are made only for employees in the private sector, mainly those
in manufacturing industries.
<P>
The State and county estimates of the payments to these private benefit plans
are prepared for each private industry at the SIC two-digit level of industrial
detail. The national estimate of these payments for an industry is allocated
to the States, and the State estimates are allocated to counties, in proportion
to the estimates of wages and salaries for that industry. The State and county
estimates of wages and salaries are used as the allocating series on the
assumption that the relationship of these payments to payrolls for each industry
is the same at the national, State, and county
levels.<A HREF="#fn24">(24)</A> The estimates of the employer payments reflect
the variation in contribution rates of payments among industries&ndash;but
not among States and counties for a given industry&ndash;and the various mixes
of industries among States and counties.
<P>
The Federal Government makes payments to a savings plan on behalf of the
civilian employees who participate in the Federal Employees Retirement System
(mainly those hired after 1983); this savings plan is classified as a private
pension plan.<A HREF="#fn25">(25)</A> The national estimate of these payments
is allocated to States and counties in proportion to the estimates of wages
and salaries for all Federal civilian employees.
<P>
The State government payments to private pension plans consist of annuity
payments made on behalf of selected groups of employees&ndash;primarily teachers.
The State estimates are based on data from the Teachers Insurance and Annuity
Association/College Retirement Equities Fund. The State estimates are allocated
to counties in proportion to the county estimates of wages and salaries for
State and local government education.
<P>
The national estimates of Federal, State, and local government payments to
employee group health and life insurance plans are allocated to States and
counties in proportion to ES-202 employment data for each level of government.
<P>
Workers' compensation plans.&ndash;The payments by employers
to privately administered workers' compensation plans consist of court-awarded
payments by the railroad industry and the water transportation industry for
work-related injuries, benefit payments by self-insured employers, and net
premiums paid by employers to private insurance companies for workers'
compensation insurance.
<P>
Programs for workers' compensation insurance are authorized by law in all
States. Federal laws authorize the court-awarded payments by the railroad
industry and the water transportation industry. Laws in many States authorize
self-insurance, and laws in the District of Columbia and in all but six States
authorize programs for private workers' compensation
insurance.<A HREF="#fn26">(26)</A>
<P>
The national estimate of the court-awarded payments by the railroad industry
are allocated to States in proportion to the number of workers killed or
injured in railroad accidents that are reported to the Federal Railroad
Administration of the Department of Transportation. The national estimate
of the court-awarded payments by the water transportation industry is allocated
to States in proportion to the estimates of wages and salaries for this industry.
<P>
The State estimates of the benefits paid by self-insured employers and of
the net premiums paid by employers for each SIC two-digit industry except
the railroad and water transportation industries are prepared in four steps.
<P>
First, the national estimate of the benefits paid by self-insured employers
for all industries is allocated to States in proportion to tabulations that
are published annually in the <em>Social Security
Bulletin</em>.<A HREF="#fn27">(27)</A>
<P>
Second, the national estimate of the net premiums paid by employers in all
industries to private insurance companies for workers' compensation insurance
is allocated to States in proportion to annual data reported in the
<em>Insurance Expense Exhibit</em> by the National Council on Compensation
Insurance.<A HREF="#fn28">(28)</A>
<P>
Third, the State estimates of the premiums and the benefits for all industries
are then combined.
<P>
Fourth, a two-way allocation procedure is used to prepare State estimates
at the SIC two-digit level for all industries except the railroad and water
transportation industries.<A HREF="#fn29">(29)</A> The national estimates
of the sum of the net premiums and the benefits for the SIC two-digit industries
are the primary control totals for the two-way allocation, and the State
estimates of the sum of the net premiums and the benefits for all industries
are the secondary control totals.<A HREF="#fn30">(30)</A>
<P>
This procedure has multiple steps. First, the primary control totals are
allocated to States by the State estimates of wages and salaries at the SIC
two-digit level to yield preliminary State estimates of the workers' compensation
benefits by industry. Second, the secondary control totals are allocated
to industries in proportion to the preliminary State estimates. Third, the
allocations of the primary control totals and secondary control totals are
alternately repeated until an allocation of the primary control totals yields
a near-balance of the matrix.
<P>
Because of the lack of county data, the State estimates of workers' compensation
payments in all industries are allocated to counties in proportion to the
county estimates of wages and salaries by industry.
<p><strong>
  Directors' fees and miscellaneous fees
</strong>
<P>
The fees paid to corporate directors accounted for about 0.9 percent of other
labor income in 1992. Nationally, about three-fourths of these fees are accounted
for by the finance, insurance, and real estate industries. Because State
and county data are unavailable, the national estimate of directors' fees
for each SIC two-digit industry is allocated to States and counties in proportion
to the estimates of wages and salaries.
<P>
The miscellaneous fees consist mainly of judicial fees to jurors and witnesses,
compensation of prison inmates, and marriage fees to justices of the peace.
These fees accounted for only 0.6 percent of other labor income in 1992.
The national estimate of each of these segments is allocated to States and
to counties in proportion to the civilian population.

  <p><strong>
    Proprietors' Income
  </strong>

<P>
Proprietors' income with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments
is the current-production income (including the income in kind) of sole
proprietorships and partnerships and of tax-exempt
cooperatives.<A HREF="#fn31">(31)</A> Proprietors' income includes the imputed
net rental income of owner-occupants of farm dwellings, but it excludes the
dividends and the monetary interest that are received by nonfinancial business
and the rental income received by persons not primarily engaged in the real
estate business.<A HREF="#fn32">(32)</A>
<P>
Proprietors' income accounted for approximately 8 percent of total personal
income at the national level in 1992 (<A HREF="tableC.cfm">table
C</A>). The estimates of proprietors' income are prepared in two
parts&ndash;nonfarm proprietors' income and farm proprietors' income. Nonfarm
proprietors' income accounted for approximately 91 percent of proprietors'
income, and farm proprietors' income, for approximately 9 percent.

  <p><strong>
    Nonfarm proprietors' income
  </strong>

<P>
Nonfarm proprietors' income consists of the income that is received by nonfarm
sole proprietorships and partnerships and the income that is received by
tax-exempt cooperatives.
<P>
The national estimates of nonfarm proprietors' income are primarily derived
from income tax data. Because these data do not always reflect current production
and because they are incomplete, the estimates also include four major
adjustments&ndash;the inventory valuation adjustment, the capital consumption
adjustment, the "misreporting" adjustment, and the adjustment for the net
margins on owner-built housing.<A HREF="#fn33">(33)</A> The inventory valuation
adjustment offsets the effects of the gains and the losses that result from
changes in the prices of products withdrawn from inventories; this adjustment
for recent years has been small, but it is important to the definition of
proprietors' income. The capital consumption adjustment changes the value
of the consumption, or depreciation, of fixed capital from the historical-cost
basis used in the source data to a replacement-cost
basis.<A HREF="#fn34">(34)</A>
<P>
The "misreporting" adjustment adds an estimate of the income of sole proprietors
and partnerships that is not reported on tax returns. This adjustment accounted
for almost half of nonfarm proprietors' income in
1992.<A HREF="#fn35">(35)</A>
<P>
The adjustment for the net margins on owner-built housing is an addition
to the estimate for the construction industry. It is the imputed net income
of individuals from the construction or renovation of their own dwellings.
<P>
The source data necessary to prepare these adjustments are available only
at the national level. Therefore, the national estimates of nonfarm proprietors'
income that include the adjustments are allocated to States, and these State
estimates are allocated to the counties, in proportion to tax return data
that do not reflect the adjustments.
<P>
In addition, the national estimates include adjustments made to reflect decreases
in monetary and imputed income that result from damage to fixed capital and
to inventories that is caused by disasters, such as hurricanes and riots.
These adjustments are attributed to States and counties on the basis of
information from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
<p>
  Income of nonfarm sole proprietorships and partnerships

<P>
Both the State and the county estimates of the income of nonfarm sole
proprietorships and partnerships for 1987&#8211;89 are based on data for those
years that were tabulated by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) from Schedule
C of form 1040 for sole proprietorships and from form 1065 for
partnerships.<A HREF="#fn36">(36)</A>
<P>
The national estimates excluding the misreporting adjustment for 1987&#8211;89
were allocated to States in proportion to the IRS data for "net profit less
loss" at the SIC two-digit level, and the national estimates of the misreporting
adjustment were allocated to States by the IRS data for "net gross receipts"
(gross receipts less refunds) at the SIC two-digit level.
<P>
However, the IRS county data at the SIC two-digit level could not be used
to prepare the county estimates for 1987&#8211;89, because the usefulness
of the data would have been severely impaired by the large number of the
suppressions to these data that would have been required to prevent the
disclosure of confidential information. Further, the IRS data for net profit
less loss could not be used, because of the volatility of these
data.<A HREF="#fn37">(37)</A> Consequently, the IRS data for net gross receipts
at the SIC division, or "one-digit," level were used to allocate the State
estimates to counties. These data were supplemented by the use of the previous
county estimates for 1987&#8211;89 for SIC two-digit industries, which are
based on extrapolations of IRS data for 1983.<A HREF="#fn38">(38)</A>
<P>
The 1987&#8211;89 county estimates were prepared in two major steps. First,
the State estimates were aggregated to the SIC division level. The aggregated
State estimates were allocated to counties in proportion to the net gross
receipts.
<P>
Second, the county estimates for each SIC division were apportioned among
the SIC two-digit industries through the use of a two-way allocation
procedure.<A HREF="#fn39">(39)</A> In this procedure, the State estimates
for each SIC two-digit industry in a division were used for the primary control
totals (in the columns), and the county estimates for the division were used
for the secondary control totals (in the rows). The State estimates were
initially allocated to counties in proportion to the previous county estimates
for 1987&#8211;89 in order to generate initial county estimates at the SIC
two-digit level. Then, each county estimate for a division was allocated
to the SIC two-digit industries in the division in proportion to the initial
county estimates for the SIC two-digit industries. The allocations of the
State estimates for each SIC two-digit industry and of the county estimates
for each division were repeated alternately until a near-balance of the matrix
was achieved. The final allocation was that of the State estimates.
<P>
The 1989 county estimates for each industry were extrapolated to 1990 by
the number of small establishments in each industry from the Census Bureau
annual series <em>County Business Patterns</em>; these extrapolations were
used to allocate the 1990 State estimates to counties. The 1991&#8211;92 State
estimates were allocated to counties in proportion to the 1990 estimates.
<p>
  Income of tax-exempt cooperatives

<P>
The income of tax-exempt cooperatives consists of the income that is received
by rural electric cooperatives, rural telephone cooperatives, and agricultural
cooperatives.
<P>
The estimates of the income of rural electric cooperatives and of rural telephone
cooperatives are based on annual data for the net margin, or profit, of these
cooperatives that have outstanding loans from the Rural Electrification
Administration (REA) of the Department of
Agriculture.<A HREF="#fn40">(40)</A> The net margin of each cooperative is
allocated to States and counties in proportion to the distribution of its
customer-members that is reported by the REA. The allocated amount for each
type of cooperative is summed to State and county totals, and these totals
are then used to allocate the national estimates to States and counties.
<P>
Agricultural cooperatives are mainly farm marketing cooperatives and farm
supply cooperatives; they are classified in the SIC in wholesale trade. The
State estimates of the income of these cooperatives are based on data provided
by the Agricultural Cooperative Service of the Department of Agriculture.
Because no source data for counties are available, the State estimates of
the income of these cooperatives are allocated to counties in proportion
to the estimates of the income of the sole proprietorships and partnerships
in wholesale trade.

  <p><strong>
    Farm proprietors' income
  </strong>

<P>
Farm proprietors' income consists of the income that is received by the sole
proprietorships and the partnerships that operate farms. It excludes the
income that is received by corporate farms.
<P>
The national and State estimates of farm proprietors' income are primarily
derived from the national and State estimates of the income of all farms
that are prepared by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The concepts
that underlie the USDA national and State estimates of farm income are generally
the same as those that underlie the BEA estimates of farm proprietors' income.
However, the USDA estimates of farm income include the income of corporate
farms, and the USDA measures depreciation on a declining-balance basis, but
BEA measures depreciation on a straight-line basis.<A HREF="#fn41">(41)</A>
<P>
To prepare the county estimates of farm proprietors' income, BEA first prepares
county estimates of the income of all farms, and it uses primarily the USDA
State estimates of the components of farm income as control totals. Therefore,
the USDA State estimates are adjusted for the differences in the measures
of depreciation and to include the sales and purchases of livestock between
farms, which are excluded from the USDA estimates of two components of farm
income&ndash;cash receipts and expenses.<A HREF="#fn42">(42)</A>
<P>
The county estimates of farm proprietors' income are calculated in three
major steps. First, estimates of "realized net income" of all farms is computed
as the gross receipts of all farms less the production expenses of all farms.
Second, the estimates of realized net income are modified by the inventory
change adjustment so that only the income from current production is measured;
this modification yields the estimates of "total net income" of all farms.
Third, the income of corporate farms is estimated, and the estimates are
subtracted from the estimates of total net income to yield the estimates
of farm proprietors' income.<A HREF="#fn43">(43)</A>
<P>
The county estimates of farm proprietors' income for 1987&#8211;92 were primarily
derived from county data from the 1987 Census of Agriculture and from selected
annual county data from the State offices that are affiliated with the National
Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) of the USDA. In addition, data from
other sources within the USDA, such as the Agricultural Stabilization and
Conservation Service, were used.
<P>
For 1987, the county estimates of 44 components of gross receipts, 13 categories
of production expenses, and 2 categories of the value of the net change in
inventories were derived mainly from the 1987 Census of Agriculture. For
1988&#8211;92, the county estimates for each State were prepared in the component
detail that corresponded to the best annual county data available for the
State.
<P>
<strong>Farm gross receipts.</strong>&ndash;The estimates of the gross receipts
of all farms consist primarily of the following items: (1) The cash receipts
from farm marketing of crops and livestock, (2) the receipts from other
farm-related activities, including recreational services, sales of forest
products, and custom-feeding services performed by farm operators, (3) the
payments to farmers under several Federal Government farm subsidy programs,
(4) the imputed value of home consumption, which is the value of the farm
products produced and consumed on farms, and (5) the imputed gross rental
value of farm dwellings.<A HREF="#fn44">(44)</A>
<P>
The largest component of gross receipts is the cash receipts from marketing.
The USDA State estimates include estimates of the cash receipts from the
marketing of about 150 crop and livestock commodities, but the county estimates
are prepared in much less detail.
<P>
Annual county estimates of cash receipts&ndash;usually for total crops and
for total livestock&ndash;for 18 States are prepared by the NASS-affiliated
State offices. BEA uses these estimates to allocate the USDA State estimates
to the counties in these States.<A HREF="#fn45">(45)</A>
<P>
For the other States, the USDA State estimates of cash receipts from the
marketing of each commodity are summed into the 13 groups of crops and the
5 groups of livestock for which county data for value of sales are available
from the 1987 Census of Agriculture. The State estimates of cash receipts
for these groups for 1987 were allocated to counties by the related census
data.
<P>
For the counties of some of these States, the 1987 county estimates of cash
receipts for selected groups of commodities were extrapolated to 1988&#8211;92
by the series for the annual production of selected crops and for the inventories
of selected categories of livestock; these series were constructed from
supplemental NASS data. The State estimates for 1988&#8211;92 were allocated
to counties in proportion to the extrapolated county estimates for 1988&#8211;92.
<P>
For the remaining commodities and for all commodities in States for which
no annual county data are available, the 1988&#8211;92 State estimates of
the gross receipts are allocated to counties in proportion to the 1987 census
data.
<P>
The State estimates of the receipts from other farm-related activities for
1987&#8211;92 were allocated to counties in proportion to the data for the
receipts from these activities from the 1987 census.
<P>
The State estimates of the Federal Government payments to farmers for
1987&#8211;92 were allocated to counties in proportion to annual tabulations
of the payments from the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service.
<P>
County source data that reflect the imputed value of home consumption and
the imputed gross rental value of farm housing are unavailable. The 1987&#8211;92
State estimates of the imputed value of home consumption were allocated to
counties in proportion to the distribution of the number of farms reported
in the 1987 census. The 1987&#8211;92 State estimates of the imputed gross
rental value were allocated to counties by the distribution of the value
of farm land and buildings from the 1987 census.
<P>
<strong>Farm production expenses.</strong>&ndash;The State estimates of the
production expenses for most items for 1987&#8211;92 were allocated to counties
in proportion to data for the item from the 1987
census.<A HREF="#fn46">(46)</A>
<P>
The 1987&#8211;92 State estimates of the production expenses for three items
were allocated to counties by series that are related to the items from the
1987 census. The State estimates of the rent paid to landlords who are not
farm operators were allocated to counties in proportion to the acreage of
the farms operated by tenants.<A HREF="#fn47">(47)</A> The State estimates
of the depreciation of machinery were allocated by the value of the machinery
and equipment. The State estimates of the depreciation of buildings were
allocated by the value of the farm land and buildings.
<P>
<strong>Inventory change adjustment.</strong>&ndash;This adjustment is an estimate
of the value of the net change during the year in the farm inventories of
the livestock and crops that are held for sale. This estimate is added to
the estimate of realized net income in the second major step in the calculation
of the estimates of farm proprietors' income, so that the estimate of farm
proprietors' income for a year will include only the farm income from production
during the year, or from "current" production. The sum of realized net income
and the value of the net change in inventories is total net income.
<P>
The role of the inventory change adjustment in the derivation of net farm
income is illustrated by the following examples. For crops, the value of
the net change in inventories is negative when farmers feed more crops to
their animals or sell more crops than they produce during the year, so that
the amount held in inventory declines and the realized net income overstates
the income from current production by the value of the net withdrawals from
inventory. For livestock, the value of the net change in inventories is positive
when the number of animals that are born or that farmers purchase is greater
than the number that they sell during the year, so that the size of the herds
increase and the realized net income understates the income from current
production by the value of the net increase in the herds.
<P>
Annual county data for the number of cattle, swine, sheep, and chickens on
farms are available from the NASS offices of some States. The 1987&#8211;92
State estimates of the value of the net change in livestock inventories on
farms for these States were allocated to the counties in these States by
the series that incorporate the county data.<A HREF="#fn48">(48)</A> The
State estimates for the other States were allocated to counties by the county
distribution of the number of livestock units on farms reported in the 1987
census.
<P>
The State estimates of the value of the net change in crop inventories for
1987&#8211;92 were allocated to counties by the annual data for crop production
from the NASS State offices. If the NASS data were unavailable, the State
estimates were allocated by the data for crop production from the 1987 census.
<P>
<strong>Adjustment to exclude the income of corporate farms.</strong>&ndash;This
adjustment is made in the third major step in the calculation of farm
proprietors' income, because the estimates of the total net income of all
farms that are calculated in the second major step include the income of
corporate farms.
<P>
The adjustment is calculated in three steps. First an adjustment ratio is
computed as the ratio of the acreage of noncorporate farms to the total acreage
of all farms in each county; the data for the acreage are from the 1987 census.
Second, the adjustment ratio is multiplied by the county estimate of the
total net income of all farms in order to derive the initial estimate of
farm proprietors' income for each county. Third, the State estimate of farm
proprietors' income is allocated to counties in proportion to the initial
county estimates to produce the county estimates of farm proprietors' income.

  <p><strong>
    Personal Dividend Income, Personal Interest Income, and Rental Income of
    Persons
  </strong>

<P>
Personal dividend income, personal interest income, and rental income of
persons with capital consumption adjustment are sometimes referred to as
"investment income" or "property income." These three components of personal
income are presented together in the State and county estimates. These components
accounted for approximately 16 percent of personal income at the national
level in 1992 (<A HREF="tableD.cfm">table D</A>).
<p><strong>
  Personal dividend income&ndash;
</strong>
Personal dividend income is the dividends received by individuals, by nonprofit
institutions, and by estates and trusts. This income consists of the payments
in cash and in other assets that are made to stockholders who are U.S. residents
by corporations in the United States or abroad; these payments exclude payments
of a cooperation's stock by the corporation to its stockholders.
<P>
Personal dividend income accounted for about 2.7 percent of personal income
at the national level in 1992 (<A HREF="lapi6992/tableD.cfm">table D</A>).
<P>
The State and county estimates of the personal dividend income received by
individuals are based on the tabulations of dividends reported on individual
income tax returns from the Individual Master File (IMF) of the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS).
<P>
The State estimates of the dividends received by individuals are combined
with the estimates of the dividends received by nonprofit institutions and
by estates and trusts, and the combined estimates are used as the control
totals for the county estimates.
<P>
The State and county estimates for 1987&#8211;91 were derived from the IMF
data for these years. The estimates for 1992 were derived from the 1991 IMF
data because 1992 data were unavailable.
<p><strong>
  Personal interest income&ndash;
</strong>

Personal interest income is the interest income received by individuals,
by nonprofit institutions, and by estates and trusts. It consists of monetary
interest and imputed interest.
<P>
Personal interest income accounted for about 13.5 percent of personal income
at the national level in 1992.
<P>
<strong>Monetary interest income.</strong>&ndash;Monetary interest consists of
the interest received by individuals from the municipal bonds issued by State
and local governments, the interest received by individuals from money market
mutual funds, and the monetary interest from all other sources.
<P>
The State estimates of the monetary interest received by individuals are
combined with the estimates of the monetary interest received by nonprofit
institutions and by estates and trusts, and the combined estimates are used
as the control totals for the county estimates.
<P>
The national estimates of the interest from municipal bonds for 1987&#8211;92
were allocated to States in proportion to a series interpolated between the
number of high-income households from the 1980 and the 1990 Census of Population.
The State estimates were allocated to counties by the distributions from
the 1980 census, because county data from the 1990 census were not available
in time to be used.
<P>
The State and county estimates of the interest received from the mutual funds
are based on the IMF distribution of dividends rather than on the distribution
of interest, because this interest is reported to the IRS as dividends.
<P>
The State and county estimates of monetary interest from the mutual funds
and from all other sources for 1987&#8211;91 were derived from the IMF data
for those years. The estimates for 1992 were derived from the 1991 IMF data
because 1992 data were unavailable.
<P>
<strong>Imputed interest income.</strong>&ndash;Imputed interest consists of
the net investment income that is received by life insurance carriers and
private noninsured pension plans, which is attributed to persons in the year
in which it is earned, and the imputed interest that is received by persons
from other financial intermediaries, which represents the value of financial
services for which persons are not charged.
<P>
The national estimates of the imputed interest from life insurance carriers
and private noninsured pension funds are allocated to States by estimates
of employer contributions to private pension funds by the State of residence
of the employee. The State estimates are allocated to counties in proportion
to BEA estimates of taxable monetary interest. This distribution is also
used in the allocation of both the State and the county estimates of imputed
interest received from other financial intermediaries.
<p><strong>
  Rental income of persons&ndash;
</strong>
The rental income of persons with capital consumption adjustment consists
of the net current-production monetary income of persons from the rental
of real property; the imputed net rental income received by owner-occupants
of nonfarm dwellings; and the royalties received by persons from patents,
copyrights, and rights to natural resources.<A HREF="#fn49">(49)</A> The
rental income of persons excludes the monetary rental income received by
persons who are primarily engaged in the real estate business.
<P>
The national estimate of the rental income of persons was slightly negative
in 1992.
<P>
The estimates of monetary and imputed rental income include the capital
consumption adjustment and adjustments for the decreases in rental income
that result from the damage to real estate that is caused by disasters, such
as hurricanes and riots.<A HREF="#fn50">(50)</A> However, the national estimates
of monetary rent and of imputed rent that are allocated to States and counties
exclude the adjustments for disasters. These adjustments are assigned to
States and counties on the basis of data from the Federal Emergency Management
Agency.
<P>
<strong>Monetary rental income.</strong>&ndash;The national estimate of monetary
rent is allocated to States and counties in proportion to the IMF data for
gross rent.
<P>
<strong>Imputed rental income.</strong>&ndash;The imputed net rental income received
by the owner-occupants of nonfarm dwellings consists of the imputed net rental
income received by the owner-occupants of mobile homes and the imputed net
rental income received by the owner-occupants of all other nonfarm dwellings.
<P>
The national estimates of imputed rent for mobile homes for 1987&#8211;89
were allocated to States and counties in proportion to a series derived by
interpolation between the State and county estimates for 1980 and for 1990.
The State and county estimates for 1980 were allocated from the national
estimate for 1980 by the number of mobile homes from the 1980 Census of Housing,
and the State and county estimates for 1990, by the number from the 1990
census.<A HREF="#fn51">(51)</A> The 1991&#8211;92 estimates were allocated
in proportion to the 1990 estimates.
<P>
The national estimates of imputed rent for all other nonfarm dwellings for
1987&#8211;89 were allocated to States&ndash;and the State estimates, to
counties&ndash;in proportion to a series derived by interpolation between
the State and county estimates for 1980 and for 1990.<A HREF="#fn52">(52)</A>
The 1980 and the 1990 State and county estimates were allocated from the
national estimates by the State and county estimates of the market value
of owner-occupied, single-family nonfarm dwellings, which were derived from
data from the censuses of housing.<A HREF="#fn53">(53)</A>
<P>
The national estimates of imputed rent for all other nonfarm dwellings for
1990&#8211;92 were allocated to States and counties in proportion to the 1990
estimates.
<P>
<strong>Royalties.</strong>&ndash;The national estimate of royalties is allocated
to States in proportion to royalties reported in the IRS series <em>Statistics
of Income</em>. Because county data for royalties are not available, the State
estimates are allocated to counties in proportion to the county estimates
of monetary interest.

  <p><strong>
    Transfer Payments
  </strong>

<P>
In personal income, transfer payments are income payments to persons for
which no current services are performed. They are payments by government
and business to individuals and nonprofit
institutions.<A HREF="#fn54">(54)</A>
<P>
Transfer payments accounted for almost 17 percent of total personal income
at the national level in 1992 (<A HREF="tableE.cfm">table E</A>).
<P>
Estimates are prepared for approximately 50 subcomponents of transfer
payments.<A HREF="#fn55">(55)</A> For organizational convenience, the
subcomponents are classified by source&ndash;government or business&ndash;and
by recipient&ndash;individuals or nonprofit institutions. In this discussion,
transfer payments consists of three major components&ndash;government payments
to individuals, government and business payments to nonprofit institutions,
and business payments to individuals.
<P>
At the county level, approximately 75 percent of the estimates of transfer
payments are derived from data for the payments. The remaining 25 percent
are allocations of the State estimates in proportion either to data that
are related to the components or to the most relevant population series.
<P>
This section is organized according to the order of the presentation of the
components and subcomponents in <A HREF="lapi6992/tableE.cfm">table E</A>.
Each estimated item is briefly defined, and the preparation of the county
estimates is described.

  <p><strong>
    <A NAME="gpi"></A>Government Payments to Individuals 
  </strong>

<p><strong>
  Retirement and disability insurance benefit payments
</strong>
<P>
<strong>Old-age, survivors, and disability insurance (OASDI)
benefits.</strong>&ndash;These benefits, popularly known as social security,
consist mainly of monthly benefits received by retired and disabled workers,
dependents, and survivors and lump-sum payments received by survivors.
<P>
The State estimates are based on annual tabulations of payments from the
Social Security Administration (SSA). The county estimates are based on SSA
tabulations of the amount of monthly benefits paid to those in current-payment
status on December 31 by county of residence of the beneficiaries.
<P>
<strong>Railroad retirement and disability benefits.</strong>&ndash;These benefits
are received by retired and disabled railroad employees and their survivors
under the Federal program of retirement insurance for railroad employees,
who are not covered by OASDI.
<P>
The State and county estimates are based on tabulations of the benefits disbursed
by the Railroad Retirement Board.
<P>
<strong>Federal civilian employee retirement and disability
benefits.</strong>&ndash;These benefits are received by retired Federal Government
employees and their survivors.
<P>
The national estimate of these payments is allocated to States in proportion
to data for the payments for September from the Office of Personnel Management.
The State estimates are allocated to counties by the tabulations of the payments
by ZIP Code area, which are summed to counties by BEA.
<P>
<strong>Military retirement benefits.</strong>&ndash;These benefits are received
by retired military personnel, including Coast Guard personnel, and their
survivors.
<P>
The national estimate for all services is combined, and then it is allocated
to States in proportion to the payments data for September that are provided
each year by the Department of Defense. The State estimates are allocated
to counties by tabulations of the payments by ZIP Code area, which are summed
to counties.
<P>
<strong>State and local government employee retirement
benefits.</strong>&ndash;These benefits consist of lump-sum payments, withdrawals,
and monthly benefits that are received by retired State and local government
employees and their survivors.
<P>
In the absence of payments data for counties, the State estimates are allocated
to counties in proportion to the estimates of wage and salary disbursements
for State and local government employees; the estimates of wages and salaries
are adjusted to a place-of-residence basis.
<P>
<strong>Workers' compensation benefits.</strong>&ndash;These benefits consist
of the payments that are received by individuals with employment-related
injuries and illnesses from publicly administered workers' compensation insurance
from both the Federal and State governments.
<P>
The State estimates of the payments received under the Federal program, which
covers only Federal civilian employees, are based on payments data from the
Department of Labor. In the absence of data for counties, the State estimates
are allocated to counties in proportion to the estimates of Federal civilian
wages and salaries, which are adjusted to a place-of-residence basis.
<P>
Benefit payments to both public and private employees from State-administered
workers' compensation funds consist of the payments received under exclusively
State-administered workers' compensation insurance programs, the payments
received under State-administered insurance programs that compete with private
insurance programs, and the payments received under State programs for
second-injury funds.<A HREF="#fn56">(56)</A>
<P>
The State estimates of these benefits are derived from data for the payments
from State workers' compensation funds by the State of work from the Census
Bureau's annual <em>State Government Finances</em>. These data are adjusted
to a place-of-residence basis by BEA. In the absence of payments data for
counties, the State estimates are allocated to counties by the sum of the
estimates of wages and salaries for private employees and State and local
government employees, which are adjusted to a place-of-residence basis.
<P>
<strong>Other government retirement and disability insurance
payments.</strong>&ndash;These payments consist of the payments of temporary
disability benefits, the payments of black lung benefits, and the payments
of benefits from the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.
<P>
Temporary disability benefits are the benefits received by workers
who are unemployed because of nonoccupational illnesses or injuries. These
benefits are from State-administered programs only in California, New Jersey,
New York, and Rhode Island.
<P>
The State estimates are allocated to counties in proportion to the civilian
population.
<P>
Black lung benefits are the benefits received by the coal miners who
are totally disabled by black lung disease (pneumoconiosis) and by the eligible
survivors of miners whose deaths were caused by the disease. Individuals
whose eligibility was established before July 1973 receive their benefits
from the SSA; those whose eligibility was established since June 1973 receive
benefits from the Department of Labor.
<P>
The State estimates of payments are based on State data from both agencies.
However, only the SSA provides county data. The State estimates are allocated
to counties in proportion to annual SSA tabulations of benefit payments for
June.
<P>
Pension Benefit Guaranty benefits are paid by the revolving fund of
the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) to individuals whose PBGC-insured
pensions cannot be paid by the private pension funds that are liable for
the benefits.
<P>
The national estimate is allocated to States and counties in proportion to
OASDI benefits, which are assumed to reflect the geographic distribution
of the retired population.
<p><strong>
  Medical benefits
</strong>
<P>
Medicare benefits.&ndash;These benefits are Federal Government
payments made through intermediaries to beneficiaries for the care provided
to individuals under the provisions of the medicare program.
<P>
The State and county estimates of payments under the hospital insurance and
supplementary medical insurance provisions of medicare are based on the dollar
amounts that are paid as reimbursement for hospital and medical expenses
and that are reported by the Health Care Financing Administration. Because
these data lag, the estimates for 1992 are based on the data for 1991.
<P>
Medical vendor payments.&ndash;These medical benefits are received
by low-income individuals; the benefits are called vendor payments because
they are measured as the payments to the vendors of the medical services.
These payments consist mainly of the payments made through intermediaries
to the vendors for care provided to individuals under the federally assisted,
State-administered medicaid program, but these payments also include payments
made under the general assistance medical programs of State and local
governments.
<P>
The State estimates of the payments made under the medicaid program are based
on payments data from the Health Care Financing Administration, and the State
estimates of payments made under the general assistance medical programs
are based on payments data from the State departments of social services.
For about half of the States, the county estimates of payments made under
both medicaid and the general assistance medical programs are based on payments
data from the State departments. For the other States, the State estimates
of all payments are allocated to counties in proportion to the payments made
under the aid to families with dependent children program.
<P>
Military medical insurance benefits.&ndash;These benefits are
vendor payments made under the Civilian Health and Medical Plan of the Uniformed
Services program for the medical care of dependents of active duty military
personnel and of retired military personnel and their dependents at nonmilitary
medical facilities.
<P>
County data for these payments are unavailable. The State estimates are allocated
to counties in proportion to the military retirement benefits.
<P>
<p><strong>
  Income maintenance benefits
</strong>
<P>
Supplemental security income (SSI) benefits.&ndash;These benefits
consist of payments received by the aged, blind, and disabled from both the
Federal and State governments.
<P>
The State estimates are based on SSA tabulations of annual disbursements
for two categories of SSI benefits: Basic Federal payments and supplemental
State payments. The county estimates of the combined categories are based
on payments data reported by the SSA.
<P>
Aid to families with dependent children (AFDC).&ndash;This
State-administered program receives Federal matching funds to provide payments
to low-income families.
<P>
The State estimates are based on unpublished quarterly data for these payments
from the SSA. The county estimates are based on payments data from the various
State departments of social services.
<P>
Food stamps.&ndash;These benefits are measured as the value
of the food stamps issued to qualifying low-income individuals in order to
supplement their ability to purchase food. Eligibility is determined by the
State authorities' interpretation of Federal regulations; the U.S. Department
of Agriculture pays the cost of the stamps.
<P>
The State and county estimates are based on county tabulations of the value
of the distributed stamps from the Department of Agriculture.
<P>
Other income maintenance payments.&ndash;These payments consist
of general assistance benefits, emergency assistance benefits, foster care
payments, earned income tax credits, and energy assistance benefits.
<P>
General assistance benefits are the payments received from State and
local governments by low-income individuals and families who do not qualify
for help under federally supported programs.<A HREF="#fn57">(57)</A>
<P>
The State and county estimates are based on payments data from the various
State departments of social services.
<P>
Emergency assistance benefits are the payments received by families
who have at least one child and who are not covered by AFDC. Under this federally
assisted program, each family is eligible only once every 12 months and is
covered for a maximum of 30 days. The participation of the States in this
program is optional; currently, about half of the States participate.
<P>
The State estimates are based on unpublished data for the payments from the
SSA. The county estimates for most of the participating States are based
on payments data from the various State departments of social services. For
the other participating States, the State estimates are allocated to counties
in proportion to the estimates of general assistance payments.
<P>
Foster care payments are made by State and local governments to families
caring for foster children.
<P>
The State estimates for 1987&#8211;92 were extrapolated from 1969 data for
these payments by the annual estimates of AFDC payments. The State estimates
were allocated to counties in proportion to the civilian population.
<P>
Earned income tax credits are Federal income tax refunds to low-income
workers who have minor children. Eligibility for the tax credits is determined
by the size of the adjusted gross income, or the earned income, and by certain
household characteristics. Only a portion of this Federal income tax credit
is counted as a transfer payment; this portion is the excess of the tax credit
over the tax liability.
<P>
The State estimates are derived from tabulations of the amount of payments
disbursed to the residents of each State by the Internal Revenue Service.
Because county data are unavailable, the State estimates are allocated to
counties in proportion to a series that was derived from data on earnings
of families in poverty status from the 1980 Census of
Population.<A HREF="#fn58">(58)</A>
<P>
Energy assistance benefits consist of both cash payments received
by needy households and vendor payments made to suppliers to help defray
the cost of home heating, cooling, and weatherization under the federally
funded and State-administered energy assistance programs.
<P>
The State estimates are based on payments data published by the SSA. The
estimates for counties in most States are based on payments data from the
various State departments of social services. For counties in States that
do not provide these data, the State estimates are allocated to counties
in proportion to SSI enrollment.
<p><strong>
  Unemployment insurance benefits
</strong>
<P>
State unemployment compensation.&ndash;These benefits consist
mainly of the payments received by individuals under State-administered
unemployment insurance (UI) programs, but they include the special benefits
authorized by Federal legislation for periods of high
unemployment.<A HREF="#fn59">(59)</A> The provisions that govern the eligibility,
timing, and amount of benefit payments vary among the States, but the provisions
that govern the coverage and financing are uniform nationally.
<P>
The State estimates are based on payments data from the Department of Labor.
The State estimates are allocated to counties by the payments data reported
by the State employment security agencies (ESA's). Most of the data are reported
by county. However, some of the data are reported by local district office;
these data are allocated to the counties in the jurisdiction of the local
district office in proportion to the estimates of the annual average number
of unemployed individuals from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). When
the availability of the county data is delayed, preliminary county estimates
for a year are prepared and then revised the following year to incorporate
the delayed county data. The preliminary estimates for a year are extrapolated
from the estimates for the preceding year by the change in the BLS estimates.
<P>
Unemployment compensation of Federal civilian
employees.&ndash;The UI program for Federal employees is a Federal
program administered by the State ESA's acting as agents for the U.S. Government.
<P>
The State estimates are based on State data on unemployment compensation
paid to Federal employees; these data are provided by the ESA's in all States.
In about half of the States, the State estimates are allocated to the counties
by county data or by local-district-office data; the allocation procedure
that is used is the same as that used for the estimates of State unemployment
compensation. For the remaining States, the county allocators are
residence-adjusted estimates of Federal civilian wages and salaries.
<P>
Unemployment compensation of railroad employees.&ndash;These
benefits are the payments that are received by railroad workers who are
unemployed because of sickness or because work is unavailable. This UI program
is administered by the Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) under a Federal formula
that is applicable throughout the Nation.
<P>
The State and county estimates are based on data for these payments from
the RRB.
<P>
Unemployment compensation of veterans.&ndash;These benefits
are received by unemployed veterans who have recently separated from military
service and who are not eligible for military retirement benefits.
<P>
The State estimates are based on payments data from the ESA's. For about
half of the States, the State estimates are allocated to counties by county
data or by local-district-office data from the ESA's; the allocation procedure
that is used is the same as that used for the estimates of State unemployment
compensation. For the remaining States, the county allocator is the population
of veterans.<A HREF="#fn60">(60)</A>
<P>
Trade adjustment allowances.&ndash;These benefits are the payments
received by workers who are unemployed because of the adverse economic effects
of international trade arrangements.
<P>
The State and county estimates are based on calendar year data for these
payments that are tabulated by "petition" (location of plant) from the Department
of Labor, which administers the program. The estimates are residence adjusted
by BEA to approximate a geographic distribution based on the place of receipt
of the benefits.
<p><strong>
  Veterans benefit payments
</strong><p>
Veterans pension and disability benefits.&ndash;These benefits
consist primarily of the payments that are received by veterans with
service-connected disabilities and by the survivors of military personnel
who died of service-connected causes. In addition, these benefits are received
by war veterans who are 65 years old or older, who have nonservice-connected
disabilities, who are permanently and totally disabled, and who meet specified
income requirements.
<P>
The State and county estimates are based on the data for these payments from
the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA).
<P>
Educational assistance to veterans, dependents, and
survivors.&ndash;These benefits are the payments of the allowances
for tuition and other educational costs that are received by veterans and
by spouses and children of disabled and deceased veterans.
<P>
The State estimates are based on data for these payments from the DVA. The
county allocator for the estimates of the benefits received by the veterans
is the number of veterans of the post-Korean-war period reported by the DVA.
The county allocator for the estimates of the benefits received by the spouses
and children is the geographic distribution of the civilian population.
<P>
Veterans life insurance benefits.&ndash;These benefits are the
claims received by the beneficiaries and the dividends received by the
policyholders from the five veterans life insurance programs administered
by the DVA.
<P>
The State estimates are based on data for these payments from the DVA. Because
county data are unavailable, the State estimates are allocated to counties
in proportion to the population of veterans.
<P>
Other veterans benefits.&ndash;These benefits consist of the
Federal Government payments received by paraplegics and by certain other
disabled veterans to purchase automobiles and other conveyances, the State
and local government payments of assistance to indigent veterans, and the
State and local government payments of bonuses to veterans.
<P>
The State estimates of the Federal Government payments are based on data
for these payments from the DVA. The State estimates are allocated to counties
in proportion to the population of veterans.
<P>
The State estimates of the State and local government payments of assistance
and of bonuses are based on fiscal year data from the Census Bureau's annual
<em>State Government Finances</em>. The State estimates are allocated to counties
in proportion to the number of the veterans of the post-Korean-War period.
<p><strong>
  Federal education and training benefits
</strong>
<P>
Federal fellowship benefits.&ndash;These benefits are the payments
that are received by the recipients of Federal fellowships; these payments
are a small portion of the total fellowship.<A HREF="#fn61">(61)</A>
<P>
These payments are estimated in three subcomponents: The payments to outstanding
science students who receive National Science Foundation (NSF) grants, the
subsistence payments to the cadets at the six State maritime academies, and
the payments for all other Federal fellowships.
<P>
The State and county estimates of the payments to the recipients of NSF grants
are based on annual NSF tabulations of the number of students receiving
fellowships at each institution.
<P>
The State and county estimates of the subsistence payments to the cadets
are based on payments data for each academy. The amount of the payment is
assigned to the State and county in which each academy is located.
<P>
Because of the lack of pertinent data, the national estimates of the payments
to the recipients of all other Federal fellowships are allocated to States
and counties in proportion to the civilian population.
<P>
Interest payments on guaranteed student loans.&ndash;These payments
are made by the Department of Education to commercial lending institutions
on behalf of the individuals who receive low-interest, deferred-payment loans
from these institutions in order to pay the expenses of higher education.
<P>
The national estimate is allocated to States in proportion to the number
of individuals enrolled in institutions of higher education from the Department
of Education. The allocator for the county estimates is the civilian population.
<P>
Higher education student assistance.&ndash;This assistance is
the Federal payments, called Pell Grants, to students with low incomes for
an undergraduate education.
<P>
The State and county estimates are based on tabulations of annual data for
these payments by the county of the educational institution from the Department
of Education.
<P>
Job Corps benefits.&ndash;These benefits are primarily the
allowances for living expenses received by economically disadvantaged individuals
who are between the ages of 16 and 21 and who are enrolled in the designated
vocational and educational training programs. These benefits also include
the adjustment allowances received by trainees upon the successful completion
of their training.
<P>
The State estimates are based on calendar year tabulations of the amount
of allowances and allotments disbursed to the enrollees; the tabulations
are from the Employment and Training Administration of the Department of
Labor. The State estimates are allocated to counties in proportion to the
civilian population.
<p><strong>
  Other government payments to individuals
</strong>
<P>
Compensation of survivors of public safety
officers.&ndash;These benefits are payments to the survivors of State
and local government employees, such as police officers and fire fighters,
who are killed in the line of duty; the payments are made under a Federal
program. Until 1988, the payment was a lump sum of $50,000 for each claim;
in 1988, the payment was $100,000. Since 1988, it has been $100,000 plus
an allowance for the increase in consumer prices.
<P>
The national estimate is allocated to States by the tabulations of the number
of claims by State from the Department of Justice. The county allocator is
the number of claims by city from the same tabulations.
<P>
Compensation of victims of crime.&ndash;This compensation consists
of payments to crime victims and to vendors on behalf of crime victims.
Currently, about three-fourths of the States have the programs for these
payments.
<P>
The national estimate of total payments is allocated to States in proportion
to information assembled by the Crime Victims Board of the New York State
Executive Department. The county allocator is the geographic distribution
of the civilian population.
<P>
Alaska Permanent Fund benefits.</strong>&ndash;These benefits are the
disbursements of investment income to the residents of Alaska from the Alaska
Permanent Fund. The fund, which is derived from oil revenues, pays a portion
of its net investment income to every resident.
<P>
The State estimate is the amount that is paid and that is reported by the
State. The State estimate is allocated to the boroughs and census areas in
proportion to the civilian population.
<P>
Disaster relief benefits.</strong>&ndash;These benefits are the Federal
payments to the victims of disasters, such as hurricanes and riots.
<P>
The State and county estimates are based on information from the Federal
Emergency Management Agency. The estimates for 1989&#8211;91 include the payments
to the victims of Hurricane Hugo and of the Loma Prieta earthquake, and the
estimates for 1992 include the payments to the victims of Hurricanes Andrew
and Iniki.
<P>
Japanese interns redress benefits.</strong>&ndash;These benefits, which
began in 1990, are the payments to the American citizens of Japanese descent
who were interned during World War II.
<P>
The State and county estimates are based on the tabulations of the these
payments by ZIP Code area from the Department of Justice. These tabulations
are summed to counties by BEA.
<P>
Federal educational exchange benefits.</strong>&ndash;These benefits
are payments to the students who participate in the Fulbright scholarship
program and in other international educational exchange programs.
<P>
In the absence of any pertinent data, the national estimates are allocated
to States and counties in proportion to the civilian population.
<P>
Bureau of Indian Affairs benefits.</strong>&ndash;These benefits are
the payments to American Indians for educational and social services that
are not available to them from State or local agencies.
<P>
The State estimates are based on data for these payments from the Bureau
of Indian Affairs. The State estimates are allocated to counties in proportion
to the American Indian population.

  <p><strong>
    Government and Business Payments to Nonprofit Institutions
  </strong>

<P>
These payments consist of the payments made by Federal, State, and local
governments and the payments, or corporate gifts, by business to nonprofit
institutions. These payments exclude Federal Government payments for work
under research and development contracts.
<P>
The national estimates of the Federal Government payments are allocated to
States in proportion to the civilian population.
<P>
The State and local government payments consists of payments for foster care
supervised by private agencies, payments for education assistance, and payments
for employment and training.
<P>
The national estimates of the payments for foster care are allocated to States
in proportion to a series extrapolated from payments data for 1969 from the
Department of Health and Human Services. The national estimates of the payments
for education assistance are allocated by payments data published by the
Census Bureau, and those for the payments for employment and training, by
the civilian population.
<P>
The national estimates of the payments by business are allocated to States
in proportion to the estimates of the wages and salaries paid by membership
organizations.
<P>
The State estimates for all the subcomponents of the payments made to nonprofit
institutions are allocated to counties in proportion to the civilian population.

  <p><strong>
    Business Payments to Individuals
  </strong>

<P>
These payments consist primarily of personal-injury liability payments to
individuals other than employees.
<P>
Because no pertinent data are available, the national estimates are allocated
to States and counties in proportion to the civilian population.

  <p><strong>
    Personal Contributions for Social Insurance
  </strong>

<P>
Personal contributions for social insurance includes the payments by employees,
by the self-employed, and by other individuals who participate in the following
programs: Old-age, survivors, and disability insurance (OASDI) (social security);
hospital insurance (HI) and supplementary medical insurance (SMI) (medicare);
State unemployment insurance (UI); temporary disability insurance; government
employee retirement; railroad retirement; and veterans life insurance (see
<A HREF="tableF.cfm">table F</A>). The payments by employees include
the payments that are sometimes made by employers on behalf of their employees
(that is, the payments that are customarily made by the employee and that
under special arrangement are made by the employer).
<P>
The payments by the self-employed are paid with their quarterly payments
of estimated Federal income taxes. Most of the payments by employees&ndash;like
the payments of individual income taxes on wages and salaries&ndash;are withheld
at the source of the disbursement of the wages and salaries. However, in
the calculation of personal income, the treatment of the payments of
contributions differs from the treatment of the tax payments. Personal
contributions are excluded from personal income: They are subtracted from
the sum of the other components of personal income.<A HREF="#fn62">(62)</A>
In contrast, the tax payments are treated as part of personal income&ndash;as
though the income from which the payments are withheld were first received
by the employee and then paid to the government; this treatment is consistent
with the definition of personal income as a before-tax measure.
<P>
The State estimates of the contributions for OASDI and HI that are made by
civilians, of the contributions for State and local government employee
retirement, and of the contributions for State UI and for temporary disability
insurance are derived from data for these contributions. State data are
unavailable for the contributions for OASDI and HI that are made by military
personnel and for the contributions for all other programs; therefore, the
national estimates of these contributions are allocated to States by related
economic series. For example, the national total of the contributions by
military personnel is allocated to States in proportion to the estimates
of military cash pay.
<P>
County data for the contributions for all programs are unavailable; therefore,
the State estimates of these contributions are allocated to counties by related
economic series. The State estimates of the contributions for all programs
except SMI, veterans life insurance, State UI, and temporary disability insurance
are allocated to counties by the appropriate wage and salary series or by
the proprietors' income series.
<P>
The State estimates of the contributions for SMI are allocated to counties
by tabulations of the number of persons enrolled in the program from the
Health Care Financing Administration; the contributions for veterans life
insurance, by the veteran population; and the contributions for State UI
and temporary disability insurance, by the civilian population.

  <p><strong>
    <A NAME="resadj"></A>Residence Adjustment 
  </strong>

<P>
Personal income is a measure of income by place of residence. The place of
residence of individuals is the State and county in which they live. The
place of residence of quasi-individuals is not defined; their income is measured
according to the State and county of the residence of the individuals who
benefit from the activities of the quasi-individuals or of the individuals
on whose behalf the income is received.<A HREF="#fn63">(63)</A>
<P>
Consequently, the residence of military personnel is the State and county
in which they live while they are on military assignment, not their permanent
or legal State of residence. Thus, the income of military personnel on foreign
assignment is excluded from the State and local area personal income series,
because their residence is outside of the territorial limits of the United
States.
<P>
The residence of seasonal migrant workers except those working in Alaska
and those who are foreign-resident border workers is the State and county
in which they live while they are working, not their usual State and county
of residence. However, the residence of foreign citizens who live in the
United States and who work for international organizations and foreign embassies
and consulates in the United States is the country of which they are citizens.
<P>
These definitions of residence differ from some of those used by the Census
Bureau, which provides source data that are used in the preparation of the
estimates of the residence adjustment and the estimates of population that
are used to calculate per capita personal income; for example, the residence
of seasonal migrant workers is frequently reported to the Census Bureau as
their usual State and county of residence rather than the State and county
in which they are living and working on April 1 when the decennial census
of population is taken.
<P>
The source data for a majority of the components of personal income are recorded,
or treated as if they were recorded, on a place-of-residence basis. These
components are transfer payments, personal dividend income, personal interest
income, rental income of persons, and proprietors'
income.<A HREF="#fn64">(64)</A>
<P>
However, most of the source data for the remaining three components, which
compose more than 60 percent of personal income, are recorded by place of
work. These components are wage and salary disbursements, other labor income,
and personal contributions for social insurance. Therefore, the initial estimates
of most of the subcomponents of these three components are on a place-of-work
basis. Consequently, these initial place-of-work estimates are adjusted so
that they will be on a place-of-residence basis and so that the income of
the recipients whose place of residence differs from their place of work
will be correctly assigned to their State and county of residence.
<P>
Correctly assigning the place of residence of the recipient of the income
is more important for the State and county estimates than for the national
estimates. For the State estimates, the income of individuals who commute
to work between States is important in metropolitan areas that extend across
State boundaries&ndash;for example, in the Washington, DC-MD-VA-WV metropolitan
area. For the county estimates, the income of individuals who commute between
counties is important in every multicounty metropolitan area and in many
nonmetropolitan areas.
<P>
For the national estimates, the income of border workers is relatively small.
Border workers consist mainly of workers who live in the United States and
who work in Canada or Mexico and vice versa.
<P>
The county estimates of the residence adjustment are prepared for the net
labor earnings&ndash;or "income subject to adjustment"&ndash;of intercounty
commuters and for the wages and salaries of border workers. Income subject
to adjustment is defined as wages and salaries plus other labor income minus
the personal contributions for social insurance by employees. The State estimates
of the residence adjustment are essentially the sum of the county estimates.
<p><strong>
  Procedure for the income of intercounty commuters
</strong>
<P>
The county estimates for 1990 were derived in two steps. First the preliminary
estimate for each county was prepared. Second, the preliminary estimates
for some counties were modified.
<P>
The 1990 estimates for most counties and the modified preliminary 1990 estimates
were then extrapolated to obtain the county estimates for 1991&#8211;92. The
extrapolation used two relevant series&ndash;one for the inflows of commuters'
earnings to each county and one for the outflows from each county. The county
estimates for 1991&#8211;92 were derived by extrapolation because intercounty
commuting data are available only from the decennial censuses of population.
In addition, the estimates for 1987&#8211;89 were derived by interpolation
between the estimates for 1980 and those for 1990.
<P>
<strong>Preliminary estimates for 1990.</strong>&ndash;The procedure that is
used to prepare the estimates of the county residence adjustment for 1990
is illustrated by the following example of the calculation of the preliminary
estimates for a two-county area that comprises counties <em>f</em> and
<em>g</em>. The example is easily generalized to the calculation of the estimates
for more complex areas.
<P>
The preliminary 1990 estimate of the residence adjustment estimate for county
<em>f</em> (<em>RAf</em>) was calculated as the total 1990 inflows of the income
subject to adjustment to county <em>f</em> from county <em>g</em> (<em>INf.</em>)
minus the total 1990 outflows of the income subject to adjustment from county
<em>f</em> to county <em>g</em> (<em>OUTf.</em>).
<P>
RAf = INf. - OUTf.
<P>
The estimates of <em>INf.</em> and <em>OUTf.</em> were prepared in industrial
detail.<A HREF="#fn65">(65)</A> The share (<em>If,k</em>) of total wages or
of other labor income (OLI) in a particular industry <em>k</em> in county
<em>g</em> that were earned by residents of county <em>f</em> was used in the
estimation of industry-level inflows to county <em>f</em>. Analogously, the
share (<em>Of,k</em>) of wages or of OLI in a particular industry <em>k</em>
in county <em>f</em> that were earned by residents of county <em>g</em> was used
in the estimation of industry-level outflows from county <em>f</em>. Both
<em>If,k</em> and <em>Of,k</em> were calculated from journey-to-work (JTW) data
on the number of wage and salary workers (<em>W</em>) and on their average
wages (<em>A</em>) by county of work for each county of residence from the
1990 Census of Population.
<P>
If,k = wages earned in <em>g</em> by residents of <em>f</em> / total wages earned
in <em>g</em><BR>
= (W(f-&gt;g),k)(A(f-&gt;g),k) / (W(f-&gt;g),k)(A(f-&gt;g),k) +
(W(g-&gt;g),k)(A(g-&gt;g),k) <BR>
Of,k = wages earned in <em>f</em> by residents of <em>g</em> / total wages earned
in <em>f</em><BR>
= (W(g-&gt;f),k)(A(g-&gt;f),k) / (W(g-&gt;f),k)(A(g-&gt;f),k) +
(W(f-&gt;f),k)(A{(f-&gt;f),k)
<P>
Where two subscripts are used with an arrow, the first subscript identifies
the place of residence, and the second identifies the place of work. For
example, <em>W(f-&gt;g),k</em> is the number of workers in industry <em>k</em>
who lived in county <em>f</em> but who worked in county <em>g</em>.
<P>
The industry-level inflows to county <em>f</em> from county <em>g</em>
(<em>INf,k</em>) were calculated as the inflow ratio multiplied by the
corresponding component of the income subject to adjustment (<em>ISA</em>)
in industry <em>k</em> in county <em>g</em> (<em>ISAg,k</em>). The industry-level
outflows from county <em>f</em> to county <em>g</em> (<em>OUTf,k</em>) were calculated
as the outflow ratio multiplied by the <em>ISA</em> in industry <em>k</em> in
county <em>f</em> (<em>ISAf,k</em>).
<P>
INf,k = (If,k)(ISAg,k)<BR>
OUTf,k = (Of,k)(ISAf,k).
<P>
Summing the inflows for all industries yields the total inflows to county
<em>f</em> (<em>INf.</em>), and summing the outflows for all industries yields
total outflows from county <em>f</em> (<em>OUTf.</em>).
<P>
INf. = "SUM" k=1 N INf,k<BR>
OUTf. = "SUM" k=1 N OUTf,k
<P>
<strong>Modifying the preliminary 1990 estimates.</strong>&ndash;The preliminary
1990 estimates of the residence adjustment for some counties were modified
in three cases. In the first case, the estimates for each of the 1099 counties
that are in clusters that have high rates of commuting among their constituent
counties (mostly multicounty metropolitan areas) were modified to incorporate
the 1989 distribution of wages and salaries from the 1990
census.<A HREF="#fn66">(66)</A> The estimates for these counties were modified
because in numerous cases, the geographic coding by place of work of the
JTW data and that of the source data for wages and salaries are
inconsistent.<A HREF="#fn67">(67)</A>
<P>
First, the preliminary estimate of wages and salaries by place of residence
for each county in each cluster was calculated as the estimate of wages and
salaries by place of work plus the net residence adjustment for wages and
salaries.<A HREF="#fn68">(68)</A> Second, the preliminary place-of-residence
estimates of wages for the counties in each cluster were summed to a total
estimate for the cluster. Third, the total estimate for each cluster was
allocated to the counties of the cluster in proportion to the 1989
wage-and-salary distribution from the 1990 census in order to produce the
modified preliminary estimates of wages and salaries by county of residence.
Fourth, the modified preliminary estimate of the residence adjustment for
each county in the cluster was calculated as the modified preliminary estimate
of place-of-residence wages minus the preliminary estimate of place-of-residence
wages plus the preliminary estimate of the residence adjustment.
<P>
The difference between the modified preliminary estimate of the residence
adjustment and the preliminary estimate of the residence adjustment was expressed
as a flow between pairs of counties in the same cluster in order to facilitate
the extrapolation of the 1990 residence-adjustment estimates to 1991&#8211;92.
In the simplest situation&ndash;a two-county cluster&ndash;the additional flow
was assumed to be from the county with the negative difference to the county
with the (exactly offsetting) positive difference.
<P>
In the second case, the preliminary estimate of the residence adjustment
for each county in 139 pairs of adjacent counties that are not in a cluster
was modified because the 1990 preliminary place-of-residence estimate of
wages for one of the counties exceeded the place-of-residence measure of
wages from the 1990 census by a substantial amount and because the census
measure for the other county exceeded the preliminary estimate by a similar
substantial amount. In order to facilitate the extrapolation of the 1990
residence-adjustment estimates to 1991&#8211;92, these adjacent-county
modifications were also expressed as intercounty flows.
<P>
In the third case, the preliminary 1990 estimates of the residence adjustment
for eight county equivalents (boroughs and census areas) in Alaska were modified
to account for the large amounts of the <em>ISA</em> received by seasonal workers
from out of State. The preliminary estimates yielded place-of-residence estimates
of wages and salaries that were so much higher than the comparable census
data that they could not be an accurate reflection of only the wages of the
permanent residents. In order to remove the excess amounts, the JTW-data-based
outflows from these county equivalents to selected large counties in Washington,
Oregon, and California were judgmentally increased.
<P>
<strong>Extrapolating the 1990 estimates to 1991&#8211;92.</strong>&ndash;The
1990 estimates of total inflows (<em>INf.^1990</em>) and the 1990 estimates
of outflows by industry (<em>OUTf,k 1990</em>) were extrapolated to
1991&#8211;92.<A HREF="#fn69">(69)</A>
<P>
The changes in the intercounty commuting patterns after the 1990 census were
incorporated into the estimates by the use of a change ratio (<em>CHRf</em>).
The numerator of the ratio for county <em>f</em> is derived from the place-of-work
estimates of <em>ISA</em> (<em>ISAf</em>) for all industries, and the denominator
of the ratio is derived from tabulations of wages and salaries by place of
residence from the Internal Revenue Service
(<em>IRSf</em>).<A HREF="#fn70">(70)</A> The ratio for county <em>f</em> in the
year <em>t</em> (<em>CHRf t</em>) is
<P>
CHRf t = (ISAf t/ISAf 1990) / (IRSf t/IRSf 1990).
<P>
The total 1990 inflows to county <em>f</em> were extrapolated to the year
<em>t</em> on the basis of the inverse of <em>CHRf t</em> and of the change in
<em>IRSf</em> since 1990.
<P>
INf. t = (INf. 1990) (IRSf t/IRSf 1990) (1/CHRf t).
<P>
For each industry, the 1990 outflows from county <em>f</em> to county <em>g</em>
were extrapolated to the year <em>t</em> on the basis of <em>CHRf t</em> and
of the change in <em>ISAf,k</em> for the industry since 1990.
<P>
OUTf,k t = (OUTf,k 1990)(ISAf,k t/ISAf,k 1990)(CHRf t).
<P>
The final estimate of the net residence adjustment for the year <em>t</em>
for each noncluster county and the preliminary estimate of the net residence
adjustment for the year <em>t</em> for each cluster county were then calculated.
The estimate of the net residence adjustment equals total inflows minus total
outflows, which are summed over all industries.
<P>
RAf t = INf. t - "SUM" k=1 N OUTf,k t.
<P>
The preliminary estimates of the net residence adjustment for the cluster
counties for year <em>t</em> are modified in a four-step procedure that is
similar to the modification of the 1990 preliminary estimates for the cluster
counties. First, the place-of-residence estimate of <em>ISA</em> for each cluster
is calculated as the sum of the place-of-work estimates of <em>ISA</em> for
all of the counties in the cluster plus the sum of the estimates of the residence
adjustment for all of the counties in the cluster. Second, an allocating
series for the counties in each cluster is prepared: The 1990 estimate of
the place-of-residence <em>ISA</em> for each county is extrapolated to the
year <em>t</em> by the wage series derived from <em>IRS</em> tabulations for
the county.<A HREF="#fn71">(71)</A> Third, the place-of-residence estimate
of <em>ISA</em> for a cluster is allocated to the counties of the cluster in
proportion to the allocating series to yield the final estimate of the
place-of-residence <em>ISA</em>. Fourth, the final estimate of the net residence
adjustment for each cluster county for the year <em>t</em> is calculated as
the final estimate of the place-of-residence <em>ISA</em> minus the estimate
of the place-of-work <em>ISA</em>.
<P>
<strong>Preparing the estimates for 1987&#8211;89.</strong>&ndash;The county estimates
of the residence adjustment for 1981&#8211;89, the years between the 1980
and the 1990 censuses, were interpolated between the 1990 estimates and the
1980 estimates. The 1980 estimates were mainly derived from JTW data from
the 1980 census and from the 1980 estimates of <em>ISA</em>; the same methodology
that was used to prepare the 1990 estimates was used to prepare the 1980
estimates.
<P>
The interpolation was prepared in four steps. First, the 1980 total inflows
to county <em>f</em> (<em>INf. 1980</em>) and the 1980 outflow from county
<em>f</em> to county <em>g</em> for industry <em>k</em> (<em>OUTf,k 1980</em>) were
extrapolated to the year <em>t</em> using the methodology (previously described)
that was used to extrapolate the 1990 flows to 1991&#8211;92. Second, the
1990 total inflows to county <em>f</em> (<em>INf. 1990</em>) and the 1990 outflows
from county <em>f</em> to county <em>g</em> for industry <em>k</em> (<em>OUTf,k
1990</em>) were extrapolated back to the year <em>t</em> using the same
methodology.<A HREF="#fn72">(72)</A>
<P>
Third, net flows (inflows minus outflows) for county <em>f</em> in the year
<em>t</em> were calculated from the 1980-based extrapolations and from the
1990-based extrapolations. Fourth, the estimate of the residence adjustment
for county <em>f</em> in the year <em>t</em> (<em>RAf t</em>) was derived from
the weighted average of the 1980-based net flows and the 1990-based net flows.
Steps three and four can be expressed as
<P>
RAf t = wi (INf. t - "SUM" k=1 n OUTf,k t) 1980 + wj (INf. t - "SUM" k=1
n OUTf,k t) 1990
<P>
where the expressions in parentheses that have the subscripts 1980 and 1990
define the net flows calculated with the extrapolations from each of those
years to the year <em>t</em>, where <em>wi</em> is the weight for the 1980-based
net flows for the year <em>t</em>, and where <em>wj</em> is the weight for the
1990-based net flows for the year <em>t</em>. The weights <em>wi</em> and
<em>wj</em> sum to 1 in each year <em>t</em>, and they vary linearly from 1981,
in which <em>wi=0.9</em> and <em>wj=0.1</em>, to 1989, in which <em>wi=0.1</em>
and <em>wj=0.9</em>.
<p><strong>
  Procedure for the income of border workers
</strong>
<P>
The residence adjustment for the income earned by border workers accounts
for the inflows of the wages and salaries earned by U.S. residents who commute
to work in Canada or who work in the United Kingdom, the outflows of the
wages and salaries earned by Canadian and Mexican residents who commute to
work in the United States, and the outflows of the wages and salaries earned
by seasonal farm workers from the Caribbean area. The adjustment does not
account for the inflows of the wages of U.S. residents who work in Mexico
or in other countries, because these workers are not numerous enough for
their income to be included in the national "rest-of-the-world" account.
<P>
The State and county estimates of the inflows and the outflows of the wages
and salaries of border workers are allocations of the national control totals
that are drawn from the rest-of-the-world account. The allocated inflows
are added to, and the allocated outflows are subtracted from, the estimates
of the net residence adjustment for the income of intercounty commuters to
obtain the final residence-adjustment estimates for the States and counties
affected by the income of border workers.
<P>
The national estimate of the inflows of the wages and salaries earned by
U.S. residents who commute to work in Canada are assigned to Michigan, New
York and the New England region on the basis of fragmentary information from
the Immigration and Naturalization Service of the Department of Justice.
The Michigan portion is assigned to Wayne and Oakland counties, and the New
York portion, to Erie and Niagara Counties. The New England portion is allocated
to the border counties of Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont in proportion
to data for employment in the forest product industries.
<P>
The small national estimate of the inflows of the wages and salaries earned
by U.S. residents who work in the United Kingdom is evenly divided between
New York County, New York, and Los Angeles County, California.
<P>
The national estimates of the outflows of the wages and salaries earned by
Mexican residents and by Canadian residents who commute to work in the United
States are allocated to States and counties in proportion to the data from
the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
<P>
The national estimate of the outflows of the wages earned by Caribbean farm
workers in the United States is allocated to States by data on the number
of authorized seasonal workers by State from the Department of Labor. The
State estimates are assigned to the counties that produce the crops that
the Caribbean workers are most often hired to harvest.

    <A NAME="technote"></A>Technical Notes 
  </strong>

<p><strong>
  Data verification
</strong>
<P>
The data that are used to prepare the estimates of personal income are checked
for obvious errors. These data are from several million administrative records
from government agencies, and it is not possible to verify each record. Either
the data from these records or the preliminary estimates that are derived
from these data are run through computer edit checks.
<P>
Several computer programs are used to check the source data or the preliminary
estimates for errors. For example, some programs array the data or the
preliminary estimates in tables so that the quality of the data can be judged.
Other programs check for statistical relationships in the data or the preliminary
estimates that exceed specified limits, which may indicate errors in the
data or in the preliminary estimation. For example, an average-wage-check
program is used to check the ES-202 county data for wages and salaries and
for employment for each Standard Industrial Classification industry division.
This program identifies possible errors in these data when the annual percentage
change in the average wages for an industry in a county exceeds the limits
of the change in the average wages specified for that industry. The limits
for each industry division are established mainly on the basis of the change
in average wages for the division at the national level.
<P>
If an error is discovered in the data or in the preliminary estimates and
if it cannot be traced to an error in the procedures that are used to process
the data or to prepare the estimates, the agency that supplied the source
data is queried, or other source data are used to prepare the estimates.
<p><strong>
  <A NAME="disclosure"></A>Disclosure-avoidance procedures 
</strong>
<P>
Like other statistical agencies, the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) is
legally required to safeguard the confidentiality of the information that
it receives. In addition, like other agencies, it must balance its responsibility
to avoid disclosing confidential information with its responsibility to release
and to publish as much information as possible. It balances these
responsibilities by presenting the estimates for regions, States, and local
areas only at the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) two-digit level,
even though it receives source data at the SIC three- and four-digit levels.
<P>
Most of the data series that BEA receives from other agencies are not
confidential. The agencies summarize these data to aggregate totals by program
and by county, so that each record, or data cell, contains data for enough
individuals or establishments to preclude the identification of the data
for a specific individual or establishment and, therefore, to preclude the
disclosure of confidential information.<A HREF="#fn73">(73)</A>
<P>
However, the ES-202 data that BEA receives from the Bureau of Labor Statistics
are not protected against the disclosure of confidential information. The
confidential information on wages and salaries for some business establishments
is identifiable from the county estimates of wages and salaries at the SIC
two-digit level that are derived from the ES-202
data.<A HREF="#fn74">(74)</A>
<P>
To prevent either the direct or the indirect disclosure of the confidential
information, BEA uses the following procedures.
<P>
After the estimates of wage and salary disbursements for each SIC two-digit
industry in a county are derived from the ES-202 data, the estimates are
checked for two types of direct, or primary, disclosures of wages and
salaries&ndash;reporting-unit disclosures and dominant-establishment
disclosures.<A HREF="#fn75">(75)</A> The reporting-unit disclosures in the
estimates are determined from the ES-202 data that specify the number of
reporting units, or establishments, that provide the data for each estimate.
The dominant-establishment disclosures are determined from an analysis of
the ES-202 data in which the dominant-cell disclosures are identified at
the four-digit level and an analysis of the ES-202 data that are classified
by the size of the firm.<A HREF="#fn76">(76)</A> All of the reporting-unit
disclosures and the dominant-establishment disclosures are identified in
the primary-wage-disclosure file.
<P>
After the primary disclosures of wages and salaries in the county estimates
have been identified, the estimates of wages and salaries, other labor income,
and proprietors' income for each SIC two-digit industry are systematically
"rolled up," or summed, to produce a file of the estimates of the total earnings
by industry. Then the total earnings file and the primary-wage-disclosure
file are analyzed in a dominant-cell suppression test in order to identify
which estimates of earnings should be suppressed because the estimate of
total earnings does not conceal a primary wage disclosure. In this test,
if the wages and salaries for an industry in a county account for more than
a specified percentage of the total earnings, then a primary earnings disclosure
exists. All of the primary earnings disclosures are identified in the
primary-earnings-disclosure file. All of these disclosures are suppressed
in the county estimates of total earnings that are released.
<P>
The primary-earnings-disclosure file is also used to identify "secondary"
and "complementary" disclosures that are possible because BEA releases summations
of the earnings estimates by industry and area; these summations include
the estimates of earnings for regions and States at the SIC two-digit and
industry-division levels and the estimates for counties at the SIC
industry-division level.<A HREF="#fn77">(77)</A> In order to determine which
estimates should be suppressed, the total earnings file and the
primary-earnings-disclosure file are used to prepare a multidimensional matrix.
This matrix is tested, and the estimates that should be suppressed are
selected.<A HREF="#fn78">(78)</A>
<P>
The priority of the selection is to maximize the information that is released
at the national and regional level. For example, the estimates for the States
in a region rather than the estimate for the region will be suppressed, and
the estimates for the counties in a State rather than the State estimate
will be suppressed. Further, the estimate for an industry at the SIC two-digit
level rather than the estimate for the industry at the SIC industry-division
level will be suppressed.
<P>
In addition, a variant of the "disturbing" technique of disclosure avoidance
and the dominant-cell suppression test are used to prevent the indirect
disclosures of the county estimates of earnings that are aggregated to derive
the estimates of earnings for metropolitan areas.<A HREF="#fn79">(79)</A>
These suppressions affect the estimates for multicounty metropolitan areas
that are derived, or partly derived, from one or more suppressed county
estimates. If the estimate for a metropolitan area would result in the indirect
disclosure of a suppressed estimate of earnings for a county in the area,
then the estimate for the metropolitan area is either "disturbed" by the
omission of the suppressed estimate, or it is suppressed. If the dollar amount
of the suppressed county estimates is small relative to the sum of the estimates
for all the counties in the metropolitan area, the sum of the county estimates
that are not suppressed is presented for the metropolitan area and marked
with an "E" indicator flag. However, if the omission of the amount of the
suppressed county estimates is large enough to impair the usefulness of the
estimate for the metropolitan area, the estimate for the metropolitan area
is suppressed, and a "(D)" is shown.
<p><strong>
  Industry classification
</strong>
<P>
The Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) provided by the Office of Management
and Budget is used for the classification of the estimates of wage and salary
disbursements, other labor income, and proprietors' income by industry.
<P>
The <em>Standard Industrial Classification Manual, 1967</em> is used for the
classification of the estimates for 1969&#8211;74, and the 1972 <em>Manual</em>
is used for the classification of the estimates for 1975&#8211;87. The 1987
<em>Manual</em> is used for the classification of the estimates for
1988&#8211;92.<A HREF="#fn80">(80)</A>
<p><strong>
  <A NAME="interpol"></A>Interpolation and extrapolation 
</strong>
<P>
Interpolation and extrapolation are used to prepare preliminary State and
county estimates of some of the components of personal income for the years
in which the data for these components are inadequate or
unavailable.<A HREF="#fn81">(81)</A> Both procedures use the data for these
components for benchmark years, and both frequently use other data that are
related to the data for the components.
<P>
Interpolation is used to derive the preliminary estimates for years that
are between benchmark years. For example, the preliminary county estimates
of wages and salaries for 1981&#8211;89 might be interpolated from the county
data for wages and salaries for 1980 and for 1990, the 2 benchmark years,
and from data for employment for 1980&#8211;90.
<P>
Extrapolation is used to derive the preliminary estimates for the years that
are beyond the most recent benchmark year. For example, the preliminary estimates
of wages for 1991&#8211;92 might be extrapolated from the benchmark data for
1990 and from employment data for 1990&#8211;92.
<P>
Both interpolation and extrapolation are illustrated in the following examples.
In the first two examples, interpolation is used to derive the preliminary
estimates of wages and salaries for an industry in counties A, B, and C for
the years 2 and 3 that are between the benchmark years 1 and 4. In the third
example, extrapolation is used to derive the estimates for year 5.
<P>
In the first example, "straight-line interpolation" is used to derive the
preliminary county estimates for years 2 and 3 from the county data for the
benchmark years 1 and 4.<A HREF="#fn82">(82)</A> The preliminary estimate
for year 2 equals the amount for year 1 plus one-third of the increase from
year 1 to year 4; the preliminary estimate for year 3 equals the amount for
year 1 plus two-thirds of the increase.<BR>

<p><strong>
  <A NAME="payinkind"></A>Pay-in-kind 
</strong>
<P>
Pay-in-kind is a component of wage and salary disbursements. The estimates
of pay-in-kind reflect the value of food, lodging, clothing, and miscellaneous
goods and services that are received by employees from their employers as
full payment or as partial payment for services performed.
<P>
In the national income and product accounts (NIPA's), pay-in-kind is depicted
as a series of imputed cash flows. The imputation of pay-in-kind is based
on the assumption that instead of giving food to the employee, the employer
pays the employee an amount in cash that equals the food's cost to the employer
and that the employee uses this amount to buy the food from the employer.
Therefore, the increase in the estimates of wages and salaries from the addition
of the imputed value of pay-in-kind equals the increase in the estimates
of personal consumption expenditures from the addition of the imputed value
of the employee's purchase.
<P>
If these imputations of pay-in-kind and of purchases were omitted from the
NIPA's, the measures of personal income, personal consumption expenditures,
and total output would all be underestimated. Moreover, the earnings of employees
who receive part of their remuneration as pay-in-kind would be understated
when their earnings are compared with those of employees whose remuneration
is all in cash.
<p><strong>
  Per capita personal income
</strong>
<P>
This measure of income is calculated as the personal income of the residents
of a given area divided by the resident population of the area. In computing
per capita personal income for States and counties, BEA uses the Census Bureau's
annual midyear population estimates. Except for the college student and other
seasonal populations, which are measured on April 1, the population for all
years is estimated on July 1.
<P>
The local area estimates of per capita personal income should be used cautiously
for several reasons. In some instances, the change in the per capita personal
income of an area may be the result of unusual conditions. For example, the
income of an area may be raised for a year as the result of a bumper crop,
or it may be reduced for a year as the result of a hurricane.
<P>
In other instances, the per capita personal income of an area may reflect
the income levels of certain groups of the resident population, but it may
not be indicative of the economic well-being of the residents of the area.
For example, the per capita income of an area may be substantially raised
for several years by a major construction project&ndash;such as a defense
facility, power plant, or dam&ndash;that attracts highly paid workers whose
wages and salaries are measured at the construction site. However, this high
per capita income may not be indicative of the economic well-being of most
of the residents of the area (or, in many cases, of the resident construction
workers themselves, because they frequently send a substantial portion of
their wages to dependents who live in other areas).
<P>
Conversely, the per capita income of an area may be reduced by the presence
of a large institutional population&ndash;like that of a college or a
prison&ndash;because little income is attributed to the residents of these
institutions. However, this low income may not be indicative of the economic
well-being of most of the residents of the area (or, in many cases, of the
institutional populations, because some of these populations, such as college
students, typically receive support from their families who live in other
areas).
<P>
Further, the per capita income of areas where the population changes rapidly
can be misleading. Because population is measured at midyear and because
income is measured as a flow over the year, the per capita income of an area
can be distorted if the population of an area changes significantly during
the year, particularly around midyear.
<P>
The per capita income of counties where farm proprietors' income is a large
portion of personal income can also be misleading. Farm proprietors' income
reflects current production, not current cash flows. Farm proprietors' income
excludes sales out of inventories, which are included in current gross receipts,
because these sales represent income from a previous year's production, not
from current production. Furthermore, farm proprietors' income includes the
value of additions to inventories. Therefore, the estimates of farm proprietors'
income do not reflect the farmers' attempts to regulate their cash flow by
adjusting inventories.<A HREF="#fn85">(85)</A>
<P>
In addition, the per capita income of sparsely populated counties that are
dependent on farming reacts more sharply to weather and world market demand
and to changing government policies affecting agriculture than the per capita
income of counties where the sources of income are more diversified.
<p><strong>
  Personal income, adjusted gross income, and money income
</strong>
<P>
The measure of personal income that is prepared by BEA differs substantially
from adjusted gross income (AGI), which is the principal measure of the income
of individuals that is tabulated by the Internal Revenue Service. Personal
income also differs from money income, which is prepared by the Census Bureau.
<P>
Personal income consists of the income of quasi-individuals as well as of
individuals, whereas AGI consists only of the income of individuals who file
individual income tax returns. Personal income includes imputed income, employer
contributions to private health and pension funds, and all of the interest
received by individuals, whereas AGI excludes imputed income, all employer
contributions, most transfer payments, and the nontaxable interest received
by individuals, which is a substantial portion of personal interest income.
Personal income, unlike AGI, excludes personal contributions for social
insurance, realized capital gains, and private pensions and
annuities.<A HREF="#fn86">(86)</A>
<P>
Money income consists only of the income that is reported as received by
individuals in the decennial census of population. Personal income for counties
is prepared annually, whereas money income for counties and cities is prepared
decennially from the data from the "long-form" sample conducted as part of
the census of population.<A HREF="#fn87">(87)</A>
<P>
Personal income, unlike money income, includes imputed income, all lump-sum
payments except those received as part of earnings, certain in-kind transfer
payments&ndash;such as medicaid, medicare, and food stamps&ndash;and employer
contributions to private health and pension funds. Personal income, unlike
money income, excludes personal contributions for social insurance, income
from private pensions and annuities, and income from interpersonal transfers,
such as child support.
<P>
Further, both BEA and the Census Bureau prepare estimates of per capita income,
but each agency uses different methods of computation. For example, the estimate
of per capita personal income for a county for 1989 is calculated as the
1989 county estimate of personal income divided by the estimate of the population
of the county in July 1989; the estimate of per capita money income for a
county for 1989 is calculated as the 1989 county estimate of money income
divided by the estimate of the population for the county in April
1990.<A HREF="#fn88">(88)</A>

  <p><strong>
    <A NAME="glossary"></A>Glossary 
  </strong>

<P>
<strong><A NAME="alloc"></A>Allocation procedure.</strong>&ndash;The allocation
procedure is used in the derivation of the estimates of State and county
personal income, because the data that are available for many of the components
of personal income at the State and county levels may not be as comprehensive
or as reliable as the data that are available at the national level. The
national estimate of a component is allocated to the States in proportion
to the States' shares of an economic, or allocating, series that is a measure
of the component or that is related to the component that is being allocated;
the State estimates are then allocated to counties. For example, the national
estimate of personal dividend income is allocated to the States&ndash;and
the State estimates are allocated to counties&ndash;in proportion to the series
for dividends reported by individuals on their Federal income tax returns.
<P>
For additional information, see <A HREF="#alloc">"The allocation procedure"
</A>in the introduction to the "Sources and Methods."
<P>
<strong>Annual rates.</strong>&ndash;The quarterly estimates of State personal
income are presented at annual rates, so that these estimates can be compared
with the annual estimates. These rates show values for a quarter at their
annual equivalent&ndash;that is, the value that would be registered if the
rate of activity measured for a quarter were maintained for a full year.
<P>
<strong><A NAME="ccadj"></A>Capital consumption adjustment
(CCAdj).</strong>&ndash;The estimates of the rental income of persons and
of nonfarm proprietors' income include the CCAdj because the depreciation
of capital that the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) uses to prepare the
estimates differs from the depreciation that businesses use to determine
the income that is reported on their tax returns, which are the sources of
the data on which the estimates are based.
<P>
The CCAdj is the difference between the depreciation valued in determining
the income reported in the source data and what is referred to as "economic
depreciation," which is valued on the basis of consistent accounting (economic
service lives and straight-line depreciation) and at replacement cost. For
example, if the reported depreciation is $1.1 million and the replacement
cost of the capital used up&ndash;calculated with straight-line depreciation
and the specified service life&ndash;is $1.3 million, then the CCAdj is -$0.2
million.

<strong>Disposable personal income.</em></strong>&ndash;Disposable personal income
is the income that is available to persons for spending and saving. It is
calculated as personal income less the sum of personal tax payments and personal
nontax payments to Federal, State, and local governments.
<P>
See also <strong>Personal tax and nontax payments</em></strong>.
<P>
<strong>Earnings.</strong>&ndash;This measure is the sum of three components
of personal income&ndash;wage and salary disbursements, other labor income,
and proprietors' income.
<P>
Each of these components is measured before the deduction of personal
contributions for social insurance, which is excluded from personal income.
Therefore, the measure "net earnings" is calculated as earnings less personal
contributions for social insurance, so that it can then be used in the
computation of personal income as the sum of net earnings, transfer payments,
and personal dividend income, personal interest income, and the rental income
of persons.
<P>
Earnings is often used in the analyses of regional economies as a proxy for
the income that is generated from participation in current production.

<strong>Extrapolation.</strong>&#8212;See <A HREF="#interpol">"Interpolation

<P>
<strong>Fiduciary.</strong>&ndash;A fiduciary is an individual or a legal entity
that serves as the administrator or trustee of an estate or of a private
trust fund. A fiduciary is required to report the income that it receives
on behalf of the beneficiaries of the estate or trust on Internal Revenue
Service form 1041.
<P>
<strong>Geographic units.</strong>&ndash;The estimates of personal income are
prepared for the following geographic units: Counties and county equivalents,
metropolitan areas, States, and regions. In addition, estimates can be prepared
for any area that can be defined in terms of counties.
<P>
The estimates are prepared for most counties and for the following county
equivalents: The District of Columbia, the boroughs and census areas of Alaska,
the parishes of Louisiana, and the independent cities of Maryland, Missouri,
Nevada, and Virginia. However, the estimates for the following areas are
combined with those for adjacent counties: Kalawao County, Hawaii; the Montana
portion of Yellowstone National Park; Menominee County, Wisconsin; and the
small independent cities of Virginia, generally those with fewer than 100,000
residents.
<P>
The estimates for metropolitan areas are aggregations of the county estimates.
The county-based definitions of metropolitan areas are used; these definitions
are issued for Federal statistical purposes by the Office of Management and
Budget. Metropolitan areas consist of metropolitan statistical areas,
consolidated metropolitan statistical areas, primary metropolitan statistical
areas, and New England county metropolitan areas. For more information and
for a list of the metropolitan areas and their constituent counties, see
Appendix C.
<P>
The estimates are prepared for all States and for the District of Columbia.
In addition, the State estimates are aggregated to prepare the estimates
for the following eight regions: Far West, Great Lakes, Mideast, New England,
Plains, Rocky Mountain, Southeast, and Southwest. The regional classifications,
which were developed in the mid-1950's, are based on the homogeneity of the
States in terms of economic characteristics, such as the industrial composition
of the labor force, and in terms of demographic, social, and cultural
characteristics.
<P>
In addition, the State estimates are often aggregated to prepare estimates
for the nine Census divisions that compose the four regions for which the
Bureau of the Census publishes its regional data so that the estimates of
personal income can be compared with the Census Bureau data.
<P>
<strong>Government enterprise.</strong>&ndash;See <strong>Legal form of
organization</strong>.
<P>
<strong>Imputation.</strong>&ndash;Imputations are added to personal income so
that a comprehensive account of total production and its distribution can
be presented. An imputation is usually the value of nonmarket goods or services
that is added to the value of marketed goods and services.
<P>
Specifically, five imputations are included in the estimates of personal
income: Imputed wage and salary disbursements, the imputed value of
owner-occupied farm housing and of food and fuel produced and consumed on
farms, the imputed value of owner-occupied nonfarm housing, the net margins
on owner-built housing, and the imputed interest income from financial
intermediaries. The net value of these imputations accounts for about 10
percent of personal income at the national level.
<P>
Imputed wage and salary disbursements, or pay-in-kind, are added to the estimates
of wages and salaries so that all the earnings of employees who receive part
of their wages in pay-in-kind will be included in personal income. This
imputation is an estimate of the value of the food, lodging, clothing, and
other goods and services that are received by employees from their employers
as full payment or as partial payment for their services. For additional
information, see <A HREF="#payinkind">"Pay-in-kind" </A>in the "Technical
Notes."
<P>
The net imputed value of owner-occupied farm housing and of food and fuel
produced and consumed on farms are part of farm proprietors' income. The
gross imputed value of owner-occupied farm housing is an estimate of the
gross rental value of the housing, and the gross imputed value of food and
fuel is an estimate of the gross value of the food and fuel; these imputations
are part of gross farm income, which includes production expenses. The production
expenses are estimated from data for the actual expenses from sample surveys.
However, the net contribution of the imputations to farm proprietors' income
and to personal income is difficult to state exactly because the expenses
are estimated as part of the total farm production expenses of the same type;
for example, the mortgage interest expense for farm housing and the mortgage
interest expense for farm land are estimated together.
<P>
The net imputed value of owner-occupied nonfarm housing is a component of
the rental income of persons. It is calculated as an estimate of the imputed
gross rental value of the housing less an estimate of the expenses associated
with the housing, which are derived mainly from data for the actual expenses
from censuses and sample surveys. The imputation is based on the assumption
that the owner-occupants are in the rental business and that they are renting
the houses in which they live to themselves: As tenants, they pay rent to
the landlords (that is, to themselves); as landlords, they collect rent from
their tenants (that is, from themselves), they incur expenses, and they may
have a profit or a loss from the rental business.
<P>
The net margins on owner-built housing is part of proprietors' income, and
it is classified in the construction industry. It is the imputed net income
of individuals from the construction or renovation of their own dwellings.
<P>
The imputed interest income from financial intermediaries is a part of personal
interest income. The imputed interest consists of two components: The imputed
interest income received by persons from investment companies and from depository
institutions, that is, from commercial banks, mutual savings banks, savings
and loan associations, and credit unions; and the imputed interest income
received from life insurance carriers and from private noninsured pension
funds.
<P>
The imputed interest income from investment companies and depository institutions
is an estimate of the value of the services (such as checking) that these
institutions provide to persons less the explicit charges made for the services.
<P>
The imputed interest income from life insurance carriers and private noninsured
pension funds is not exactly an imputation, but an accounting entry. It is
an estimate of the investment income that is earned on these institutions'
financial reserves and that is credited to the policyholders or the pension
beneficiaries; the attribution of this income to persons is made so that
the investment earnings of these intermediaries is included in personal income
and saving.
<P>
<strong>Interpolation.</strong>&ndash;See <A HREF="#interpol">"Interpolation
and extrapolation" </A>in the "Technical Notes."
<P>
<strong>Inventory valuation adjustment (IVA).</strong>&ndash;This adjustment
is made to a component of proprietors' income&ndash;nonfarm proprietors'
income&ndash;because the valuation of inventory withdrawals that is used in
the national income and product accounts (NIPA's) differs from the valuation
of withdrawals that nonfarm proprietors use to determine the income that
is reported in the tax-return data on which the NIPA estimates of nonfarm
proprietors' income are based. Businesses often value inventory withdrawals
at their acquisition cost rather than at their replacement cost, which is
the valuation that is used in the NIPA's.
<P>
Valuing inventory withdrawals at their acquisition cost results in the inclusion
in business income of the capital gains or losses realized on sales out of
inventory. These capital gains or losses must be removed from the estimates
of this income so that the estimates will reflect income from current production.
<P>
The IVA is an estimate of the capital gains or losses with the sign reversed;
adding this estimate to the source data for nonfarm proprietors' income removes
the capital gains or losses. The IVA is calculated as the difference between
the valuation of inventory withdrawals that is reported in the source data
and the valuation of withdrawals that is used in the NIPA's. For example,
if the acquisition cost of an item was $5,000 and if its replacement cost
when it is withdrawn from inventory is $6,000, then the IVA is -$1,000.
<P>
<strong>Labor earnings.</strong>&ndash;This measure of income is calculated as
the sum of wage and salary disbursements and other labor income less personal
contributions for social insurance by employees. This measure is used in
the residence adjustment procedure for the quarterly estimates of State personal
income. A slightly modified version of labor earnings&ndash;termed "income
subject to adjustment"&ndash;is used in the residence adjustment of the annual
estimates of State and county personal income.
<P>
See also <strong>Earnings</strong>.
<P>
<strong>Legal form of organization.</strong>&ndash;Businesses are classified
into five categories according to their legal form of organization: Corporate
business, government enterprises, partnerships, sole proprietorships, and
"other" private business.
<P>
A corporate business is any entity that is required to file a Federal corporate
tax return (Internal Revenue Service (IRS) form 1120 series). This classification
includes mutual financial institutions and cooperatives that are subject
to Federal income tax, private noninsured pension funds, nonprofit organizations
that primarily serve businesses, Federal Reserve banks, and federally sponsored
credit agencies.
<P>
Government enterprises are government agencies that cover a substantial portion
of their operating costs by selling goods and services to the public and
that maintain their own separate accounts.
<P>
Partnerships and sole proprietorships are primarily classified according
to the type of Federal income tax form that is filed with the IRS. Partnerships
are legal entities that are required to file a U.S. Partnership Return of
Income, IRS form 1065. Sole proprietorships are entities that are required
to file IRS Schedule C (Profit or Loss from Business) or Schedule F (Farm
Income and Expenses) if the proprietors meet the filing requirements for
form 1040 and owner-occupied farm housing.
<P>
Other private businesses consists of entities that are required to report
rental and royalty income on Schedule E (Supplemental Income and Loss) if
the individuals meet the filing requirements for form 1040, tax-exempt
cooperatives, owner-occupied nonfarm housing, and buildings and equipment
that are owned and used by nonprofit institutions that primarily serve
individuals.
<P>
<strong>Local areas.</strong>&ndash;Local areas consist of metropolitan areas
and of counties and county equivalents.
<P>
See also <strong>Geographic units</strong>.
<P>
<strong>Metropolitan areas.</strong>&ndash;Metropolitan areas are defined for
Federal statistical purposes by the Office of Management and Budget. Generally,
they are defined in terms of counties.
<P>

<P>
<strong>Other labor income.</strong>&ndash;This component of personal income
consists of employer contributions to privately administered pension and
profit-sharing plans, to private group health and life insurance plans, to
supplemental unemployment insurance benefit plans, and to privately administered
workers' compensation insurance; corporate directors' fees, and a miscellaneous
component. The miscellaneous component consists of jury and witness fees,
the compensation of prison inmates, and marriage fees to justices of the
peace.
<P>
<strong>Other private business.</strong>&ndash;See <strong>Legal form of
organization</strong>.
<P>
<strong>Partnership.</strong>&ndash;A partnership is an unincorporated business
association of two or more partners.
<P>
See also <strong>Legal form of organization</strong>.
<P>
<strong>Pay-in-kind.</strong>&ndash;Pay-in-kind is a component of wage and salary
disbursements. The estimates of pay-in-kind reflect the value of the food,
lodging, clothing, and miscellaneous goods and services that are received
by employees from their employers as full payment or as partial payment for
services performed.
<P>

<P>
<strong>Per capita personal income.</strong>&ndash;This measure of income is
calculated as the total personal income of the residents of an area divided
by the population of the area.
<P>
Per capita personal income is often used as an indicator of the quality of
consumer markets and of the economic well-being of the residents of an area.
However, this measure should be used cautiously; for a discussion of the
limitations of this measure and of the differences between this measure and
the Census Bureau's estimates of per capita money income, see the
<A HREF="#technote">"Technical Notes."</A>
<P>
<strong><A NAME="pcsi"></A>Personal contributions for social
insurance.</strong>&ndash;These contributions include the contributions,
or payments, by employees, by the self-employed, and by other individuals
to the following social insurance programs: Old-age, survivors, and disability
insurance, which is also known as social security; hospital insurance; State
and local government employee retirement insurance; Federal civilian employee
retirement; railroad employee retirement; State unemployment insurance; temporary
disability insurance; veterans life insurance; and supplementary medical
insurance.
<P>
These contributions are excluded from personal income by definition, but
the estimates of three components of personal income&ndash;wage and salary
disbursements, other labor income, and proprietors' income&ndash;are presented
before these contributions are deducted. Therefore, the estimates of these
contributions are subtracted from the sum of the estimates of these three
components in order to derive the estimates of personal income.
<P>
See also <strong>Earnings, Labor earnings,</strong> and <strong>Personal
income</strong>.
<P>
<strong>Personal dividend income.</strong>&ndash;This component of personal income
consists of the dividends that are received by individuals and by nonprofit
institutions and the dividends that are retained and reinvested by fiduciaries.
Dividends are payments in cash or other assets, excluding the corporation's
own stock, made by corporations located in the United States or abroad to
noncorporate stockholders who are U.S. residents.
<P>
The State and local area estimates of this component are combined with the
estimates of personal interest income and the estimates of rental income
of persons.

<strong>Personal income.</strong>&ndash;The personal income of an area is defined
as the income that is received by, or on behalf of, all the individuals who
live in the area; therefore, the estimates of personal income are presented
by the place of residence of the income recipients.
<P>
Personal income consists of the income that is received by persons from
participation in production, from government and business transfer payments,
and from government interest (which is treated like a transfer payment).
It is calculated as the sum of wage and salary disbursements, other labor
income, proprietors' income with inventory valuation and capital consumption
adjustments, rental income of persons with capital consumption adjustment,
personal dividend income, personal interest income, and transfer payments
to persons, less personal contributions for social insurance.

and salary disbursements</strong>.
<P>
<strong>Personal interest income.</strong>&ndash;This component of personal income
is the interest income that is received by persons from all sources. The
estimates of personal interest income consist of the estimates of both monetary
interest and imputed interest.
<P>
The State and local area estimates of personal interest income are combined
with the estimates of personal dividend income and the estimates of rental
income of persons.
<P>
<strong>Personal tax and nontax payments.</strong>&ndash;Personal tax and nontax
payments consists of the tax payments (net of refunds) by persons that are
not chargeable to business expense and certain other payments that are made
by persons to government agencies except government enterprises and that
are treated like taxes.
<P>
Personal taxes includes taxes on income, including realized net capital gains,
on gifts and transfers of estates, and on personal
property.<A HREF="#fn89">(89)</A> Nontaxes includes donations, fees, fines,
and forfeitures.
<P>
The estimates of tax and nontax payments are used in the derivation of disposable
personal income, which is calculated as personal income less personal and
nontax tax payments.
<P>
<strong>Persons.</strong>&ndash;Persons is defined as individuals and
quasi-individuals that serve individuals or that act on behalf of individuals.
Quasi-individuals consists of nonprofit institutions that primarily serve
individuals, private noninsured welfare funds, and private trust funds.
<P>
<strong>Proprietors' income with inventory valuation and capital consumption
adjustments.</strong>&ndash;This component of personal income is the
current-production income (including the income in kind) of sole proprietorships
and partnerships and of tax-exempt cooperatives. It consists of nonfarm
proprietors' income and farm proprietors' income.
<P>
Proprietors' income includes the imputed net rental income of the owner-occupants
of farm dwellings, but it excludes both the imputed rental income of the
owner-occupants of nonfarm dwellings and the monetary rental income that
is received by persons who are not primarily engaged in the real estate business.
It also excludes the dividends and the monetary interest that are received
by proprietors of nonfinancial businesses.

<strong>Region.</strong>&ndash;See <strong>Geographic units</strong>.
<P>
<strong>Rental income of persons with capital consumption
adjustment.</strong>&ndash;This component of personal income consists of the
net current-production income of persons from the rental of real property,
the imputed net rental income of the owner-occupants of nonfarm dwellings,
and the royalties received by persons from patents, copyrights, and the rights
to natural resources. It excludes the rental income of persons who are primarily
engaged in the real estate business and the imputed net rental income of
owner-occupied farm dwellings.
<P>
See also <strong>Capital consumption adjustment</strong>.
<P>
The State and local area estimates of the rental income of persons are combined
with the estimates of personal dividend income and the estimates of personal
interest income.
<P>
<strong>Residence adjustment.</strong>&ndash;Personal income is, by definition,
a measure of the income that is received by persons; the State and county
estimates of personal income are presented by the State and county of residence
of the income recipients.
<P>
However, the initial estimates of most of the components of wage and salary
disbursements, other labor income, and personal contributions for social
insurance by employees are on a place-of-work basis, because these estimates
are prepared from source data that are reported and recorded by the place
of work of the recipients rather than by their place of
residence.<A HREF="#fn90">(90)</A> Consequently, these initial estimates
are adjusted so that they will be on a place-of-residence basis and so that
the income of the recipients whose place of residence differs from their
place of work will be correctly assigned to their country, State, and county
of residence.<A HREF="#fn91">(91)</A>
<P>
See also <A HREF="#resadj">"Residence Adjustment" </A>in the "Sources and
Methods."
<P>
<strong>Residence, place of.</strong>&ndash;The place of residence of individuals
is the State and county in which they live. The place of residence of
quasi-individuals is not defined; their income is measured according to the
State and county of the residence of the individuals who benefit from the
activities of the quasi-individuals or of the individuals on whose behalf
the income is received.
<P>
Consequently, the residence of military personnel is the State and county
in which they live while they are on military assignment, not their permanent
or legal State and county of residence, and the residence of seasonal migrant
workers except those working in Alaska is the State and county in which they
live while they are working, not their usual State and county of residence.
However, the residence of foreign citizens who live in the United States
and who work for international organizations and foreign embassies and consulates
in the United States is the country of which they are citizens.
<P>
These definitions of residence differ from some of those used by the Census
Bureau; for example, on their census forms, some seasonal migrant workers
report their usual State and county of residence rather than the State and
county in which they are living and working when the census is taken.

<P>
<strong>Standard Industrial Classification (SIC).</strong>&ndash;The SIC that
is published in the <em>Standard Industrial Classification Manual</em> by the
Office of Management and Budget is used in the presentation of the State
and local area estimates of earnings by industry. It is only used for the
estimates for the private sector, although it is designed to cover both public
and private economic activities.
<P>
In the SIC, establishments are classified by the primary activity in which
they are engaged, and each establishment is assigned an industry
code.<A HREF="#fn92">(92)</A> Industries are classified in the following
four levels: The division or one-digit level, such as manufacturing; the
major-group or two-digit level, such as food and kindred products; the
industry-group or three-digit level, such as meat products; and the industry
or four-digit level, such as meat packing plants.
<P>
The estimates of earnings are presented at the division and two-digit levels.
<P>
<strong>State.</strong>&ndash;See <strong>Geographic units</strong>.
<P>
<strong>Tax-exempt cooperative.</strong>&ndash;A tax-exempt cooperative is a
nonprofit business organization that is collectively owned by its members.
Although tax-exempt cooperatives are incorporated, their income is classified
as part of proprietors' income.
<P>
See also <strong>Legal form of organization</strong>.
<P>
<strong>Transfer payments.</strong>&ndash;This component of personal income measures
the payments to persons for which no current services have been performed.
It consists of payments to individuals and to nonprofit institutions by Federal,
State, and local governments and by businesses.
<P>
<strong><A NAME="GL-disburse"></A>Wage and salary
disbursements.</strong>&ndash;This component of personal income measures
the remuneration of employees; it includes the compensation of corporate
officers; commissions, tips, and bonuses; voluntary employee contributions
to certain deferred compensation plans, such as 401(k) plans; and receipts
in kind, or pay-in-kind, that represent income to the recipient. It reflects
the amount of wages and salaries disbursed, but not necessarily earned, during
the year.
<P>
This component is measured before deductions, such as social security
contributions and union dues.

8. At the national level, personal income is part of the
personal income and outlay account, which is one of the five accounts that
compose the national income and product accounts.
<P>
Of the aggregations in the personal income and outlay account, only personal
income, disposable personal income, and personal tax and nontax payments
are estimated for States, and only personal income is estimated for counties
and metropolitan areas. In addition, gross state product (GSP), which corresponds
to gross domestic product (GDP), is estimated; GSP and State personal income
share most of the elements of earnings by State of work; earnings consists
of wage and salary disbursements, other labor income, and proprietors' income.
<P>

<P>
9. The national estimates may temporarily differ from the
State and county estimates because of different estimating schedules: The
State and county estimates frequently incorporate source data that are not
available when the national estimates are prepared; these data are later
incorporated into the national estimates when they are revised.
<P>
10. The residence adjustment is mainly an estimate of
the net inflow of the labor earnings of interstate and intercounty commuters.
<P>
The State and county estimates of wages by place of work, like the national
estimates of wages for domestic industries, exclude the wages of the
U.S.-resident border workers and include the wages of the foreign-resident
border workers.
<P>
In the derivation of the national, State, and county estimates of personal
income, the wages and salaries of these workers are adjusted: The wages of
the foreign-resident workers are subtracted from estimates of wages and salaries,
and the wages of the U.S.-resident border workers are added to these estimates.
<P>
11. The data from the State unemployment insurance programs
are collected by the various State employment security agencies and are assembled
and supplied by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
<P>
12. However, the national estimates of most components
of wages and salaries and transfer payments, which together account for about
75 percent of personal income, are based mainly on the sum of State and county
source data. Therefore, the use of the allocation procedures to prepare the
State and county estimates of these components results in estimates that
do not differ greatly from the source data.
<P>
13. Each quarter, the ESA's send these data to the Bureau
of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor, which edits the data and
makes the tabulations available to BEA. The ES-202 tabulations for 1987 are
based on the 1972 SIC, and those for 1988&#8211;92 are based on the 1987 SIC.
<P>
14. State UI laws require employers to estimate (if
applicable) the cash value of pay-in-kind and to add the estimate to the
cash pay in their report of their payrolls. However, because employers are
not required to distinguish between the two types of pay in their reports,
it is doubtful that many comply with this requirement.
<P>
Pay-in-kind is significant only in the following industries: Water
transportation, eating and drinking places, and hotels and other lodging
places.

17. Railroad companies are classified according to a 3-year
average of their operating revenues. Since 1991, Class I railroads have been
classified as those with revenues of $96.1 million or more.
<P>
18. The CBP data are tabulated from the administrative
records of the old-age, survivors, and disability insurance program. This
program exempts nonprofit religious organizations, such as many of these
schools, from coverage, but its provisions for elective coverage have resulted
in the participation of most of these schools and many of the other religious
organizations.

The "General Summary" is a tabulation of the number of members of religious
orders who are employed in Catholic institutions in each diocese and in each
State. The data are classified by clerical title and by religious assignment.
<P>
The number of teachers does not distinguish between those who receive cash
wages and those who receive only pay-in-kind, nor does it distinguish between
those who teach in elementary and secondary schools and those who teach in
colleges and universities.
<P>
20. Officers do not receive pay-in-kind. The imputation
for clothing is limited to standard issue clothing; it does not include clothing
and equipment for special or unusual duties.
<P>
21. This category corresponds to a portion of the
rest-of-the-world category in the national estimates, which also includes
the addition of the wages and salaries of U.S. residents who commute to work
in Canada and the subtraction of the wages and salaries of foreign residents
who work in the United States.
<P>

<P>
22. The estimates of the expenditures for 1968 were prepared
by the Balance of Payments Division of BEA.
<P>
23. Other labor income excludes employer contributions
for social insurance, which are paid to government-administered funds.
<P>
Under the conventions of the national income and product accounts, the benefits
paid from social insurance funds, not the employer contributions to the funds,
are measured as part of personal income. These benefits are classified as
transfer payments; see the section on <A HREF="#gpi">"Government Payments
to Individuals" </A>on page M-22.
<P>
24. The data used to prepare the national estimates of
the payments by private employers are unsuitable for preparing the State
and county estimates. The national estimates are mainly based on data from
a sample of business income tax returns that is prepared by the Internal
Revenue Service. However, the geographic distribution of the data from the
tax returns does not necessarily reflect the place of work of the employees,
because most multiestablishment businesses file income tax returns for the
entire company rather than for each establishment, and the county in which
a business' principal office is located often differs from the county of
some of its other establishments.
<P>
25. Although this savings plan is administered by a Federal
agency, it is classified by BEA as a private pension plan rather than as
a social insurance fund, because the saving is considered to be private saving
rather than government saving. Accordingly, employer payments to this plan
are counted as part of other labor income, and employee payments are counted
as personal saving rather than as personal contributions for social insurance.
<P>
26. In addition, various State laws establish State-operated
insurance funds (both exclusive funds and funds that compete with private
insurers) and second-injury funds, and Federal law establishes the compensation
program for injured Federal employees.
<P>
These insurance programs are classified as social insurance; see
footnote 23.
<P>
27. These payments consist of cash payments and medical
payments, which may include medical benefits paid by employers who carry
substandard medical coverage.
<P>
Under a self-insurance program, an employer assumes the liability for the
payments for workers' compensation; the employer makes the payments out of
operating funds.
<P>
28. The available State data are gross figures for the
premiums, which have not been discounted, retrospectively rated, or otherwise
modified.
<P>
29. In a two-way allocation, two sets of control totals
are placed in a matrix as the row and column totals. The allocating series
is placed in the same matrix as the set of elements. These elements are adjusted
alternately to sum to the row and column totals until the sums of the elements
approach both the row and the column totals.
<P>
30. In this procedure, the primary control totals are
the column totals and the secondary control totals are the row totals.
<P>
31. A sole proprietorship is an unincorporated business
owned by a person. A partnership is an unincorporated business association
of two or more partners. A tax-exempt cooperative is a nonprofit business
organization that is collectively owned by its members.
32. The dividends are included in personal dividend income,
the monetary interest, in personal interest income, and the rental income,
in rental income of persons.
<P>
33. For other adjustments to the tax data, see NIPA table
8.20, "Relation of Nonfarm Proprietors' Income in the National Income and
Product Accounts (NIPA's) to Corresponding Measures as Published by the Internal
Revenue Service," <em>Survey</em> 74 (July 1994): 118.
<P>
34. The capital consumption adjustment also reflects the
differences between the depreciation schedules used for tax accounting and
straight-line depreciation based on economic service lives.
<P>
See the <A HREF="#glossary"></A>"Glossary" for more information about the
capital consumption adjustment and the inventory valuation adjustment.
<P>
35. See footnote 15 in the section
"Wage and Salary Disbursements."
<P>
36. The geographic coding of the data is by tax-filing
address. This address is assumed to be the same as the address of the place
of residence. For additional information, see the <A HREF="#place">"Place
of measurement" </A> in the introduction to "Sources and Methods" on page
M&#8211;6.
<P>
37. The volatility is frequently indicated by fluctuations
between positive and negative values, which usually leads to anomalous results
when the data are used in an allocation.
<P>
38. For information about the preparation of the county
estimates before the 1987&#8211;89 tax return data became available, see U.S.

total number of the customer-members, including businesses; the data for
the telephone cooperatives are for the number of residential customer-members.
<P>
41. For the differences between the USDA and the BEA estimates
of net farm income at the national level, see NIPA table 8.21, "Relation
of Net Farm Income in the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA's) to
Net Farm Income as Published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA),"
<em>Survey</em> 74 (July 1994): 118.
<P>
42. These transactions are excluded from the USDA State
estimates of the cash receipts from marketing livestock and of the expenses
for livestock purchases, because in the aggregated State estimates of farm
income, the cash receipts from intrastate interfarm sales offset the expenses
for intrastate interfarm purchases.
<P>
Because these transactions may not be intracounty transactions, BEA estimates
the transactions for each State and adds the estimate to the USDA State estimates
of these cash receipts and of these expenses.
<P>
43. The derivation of the county estimates of farm
proprietors' income is available in detailed tables from the Regional Economic
Information System. See also the <A HREF="#intro">"Introduction"</A> and
the sample of table CA45 in Appendix B.
<P>
44. Receipts for recreation services are received for
providing facilities for recreational activities, such as fishing, hunting,
and camping.
<P>
The inclusion of the imputed gross rental value of farm housing in gross
receipts offsets the expenses&ndash;including interest, taxes, and
depreciation&ndash;that are associated with the operation of the housing.
These expenses are included in farm production expenses, but they cannot
readily be distinguished from nonhousing expenses of the same type.
<P>
The net effect of including both the imputed gross rental value and the
associated expenses in the farm income accounts is to add the net rental
value of farm housing to farm income. The net rental value of the housing
occupied by farm proprietors is part of proprietors' income; the net rental
value of the housing occupied by farm employees is part of pay-in-kind.
<P>
45. The county estimates of cash receipts are available
for Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky,
Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania,
South Carolina, Utah, and Wisconsin.
<P>
46. Direct allocators for the following expenses are available
from the 1987 census: Purchases of feed, livestock including poultry, seed,
fertilizer and agricultural chemicals including lime, and petroleum products;
cash wages, perquisites, and social security taxes; contract labor expenses;
machine hire and custom work; electricity; interest; taxes; repair and
maintenance; and a miscellaneous category that includes animal health costs.
<P>
47. The rent paid by farm operators to landlords who are
also farm operators is omitted from production expenses and from gross receipts
because it is assumed that the tenant and the landlord usually operate farms
in the same county and that the rent paid usually offsets the rental income
received.
<P>
48. The number of animals on farms at the end of each
year is reported. For each type of livestock, the allocating series for the
value of the net change in inventories is the number of animals at the end
of the year minus the number of animals at the end of the previous year.
<P>
49. The imputed net rental income received by the
owner-occupants of farm dwellings is included in farm proprietors' income.
<P>
50. See <A HREF="#ccadj">"Capital consumption
adjustment"</A> in the "Glossary."
<P>
51. In the censuses, the number of mobile homes includes
trailers, which do not yield imputed rent. However, the number of trailers
is too small to significantly affect the estimates of imputed rent for the
mobile homes.
<P>
52. The interpolations for States were partly based on
data for the four census regions from the Census Bureau's biennial American
Housing Survey.
<P>
53. The 1980 and the 1990 estimates of the market value
for each State and county were calculated as the product of the number of
owner-occupied, single-family nonfarm dwellings and the median value of those
dwellings.
<P>
54. Transfer payments from the rest of the world are netted
against similar payments to the rest of the world, and the net payments,
termed "personal transfer payments to rest of the world (net)," are entered
in the national income and products accounts as part of personal outlays.
<P>
55. available from the Regional Economic Information System. See the
<A HREF="#intro">"Introduction"</A> and the sample of table CA35 in Appendix
B.
<P>
56. Second-injury funds underwrite the risk of a subsequent
work-related injury to an already disabled worker. Therefore, the liability
of the employer of a disabled worker is limited to the liability for the
impairment resulting from the injury sustained during the present employment.
The difference between the compensation for the full impairment and the
employer's liability is paid out of the second-injury fund.
<P>
57. The Federal Government neither funds nor regulates
these programs.
<P>
58. The data from the 1990 census were not available in
time to be used in the preparation of the estimates.
<P>
59. The program for Federal civilian employees and that
for veterans are administered by the States, but the benefits are classified
in other subcomponents of unemployment insurance benefits.
<P>
60. The Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) periodically
issues estimates of the number of veterans by place of residence and by period
of service. To prepare estimates of the veteran population for the years
between the DVA estimates, BEA uses straight-line interpolation; the estimates
for the most current year in the DVA series are used for each subsequent
year.
<P>
61. The large portion of a Federal fellowship is paid
to the school that the recipient attends. This payment is classified as a
transfer payment to a nonprofit institution if the school is privately
administered, or it is classified as a government grant-in-aid if the school
is publicly administered.
<P>
62. See <A HREF="#pcsi">"Personal contributions for social
insurance" </A>and <A HREF="#GL-disburse">"Wage and salary disbursements"
</A>in the "Glossary."
<P>
63. Quasi-individuals are nonprofit institutions, private
welfare funds, and private trust funds.

64. For specific information about the source data for
the estimates of the major components, see the section <A HREF="#place">"Place
of measurement" </A>in the introduction to the "Sources and Methods."
<P>
65. The inflows and the outflows of wages and salaries
and of other labor income were prepared for the private sector by Standard
Industrial Classification divisions and for the public sector by Federal
civilian, military, and State and local governments.
<P>
The inflows and the outflows of personal contributions were also calculated,
but the calculations are at a more aggregated level because the estimates
of the contributions by private-sector employees are not made by industry.
<P>
66. The 1989 distribution reflects the place of residence
of the income recipients on April 1, 1990, not their place of residence when
they received the wages and salaries.
<P>
67. For example, the source data may attribute too much
of the wages of a multiestablishment firm to the county in which a firm's
main office is located; the source data for the wages of the personnel on
a military base that extends across county boundaries may attribute the wages
to one county, but the JTW data may attribute these wages to the other county.
<P>
68. Only the intercounty flows for wages and salaries
were used in the calculation of the net residence adjustment.
<P>
69. The outflows from a county of work to each county
of residence were extrapolated to facilitate the preparation of the annual
and quarterly State estimates. However, the inflows to a county of residence
from all other counties were first combined, and then the combined inflows
were extrapolated.
<P>
Both the flows that were calculated from the JTW data and the flows that
express the modifications to the preliminary estimates of the residence
adjustment were extrapolated.
<P>
The superscript 1990 was added to these expressions in order to distinguish
the variables for 1990 from those for 1991&#8211;92; these variables are denoted
in the following text and in the equations with the superscript t.
<P>
70. The county tabulations of the wages that are reported
by individuals to the IRS and that are recorded by tax-filing address are
available to BEA with a 1- or 2-year lag. These tabulations are used to prepare
a series of wages and salaries that is used in the extrapolation of the 1990
estimates of inflows and of outflows.
<P>
The tabulations through 1991 were available for the preparation of the 1992
estimates.
<P>
This series was extrapolated to 1992 by a set of equations that relates the
change in the IRS county tabulations to the changes in the county place-of-work
estimates and to the change in the civilian population.
<P>
71. See footnote 70.
<P>
72. The methodology used to extrapolate the inflows and
outflows for a benchmark year to years after the benchmark year may also
be used to extrapolate the inflows and outflows for a benchmark year to years
before the benchmark year.
<P>
73. For a list of some of the agencies that provide data
to BEA, see <A HREF="#datasource">"Sources of the data" </A>in the introduction
to the "Sources and Methods."
<P>
74. For specific information, see <A HREF="#disburse">"Wage
and Salary Disbursements."</A>
<P>
75. A reporting-unit disclosure results when the data
for a reporting unit, or an establishment, are identifiable because these
data are in a cell that contains data for fewer than a specified number of
establishments.
<P>
A dominant-establishment disclosure results when the data for an establishment
are identifiable because these data account for a specified, large percentage
of the total data in the cell.
<P>
76. The State employment security agencies that report
the ES-202 data to the Bureau of Labor Statistics identify the
dominant-establishment disclosures at the four-digit level from the information
provided by the employers.
<P>
Only the data for the first quarter of a year are classified by the size
of the establishment.
<P>
77. A secondary disclosure results from the derivation
of the primary disclosure of the county estimate of earnings for a SIC two-digit
industry from the estimate of earnings for the SIC industry division and
from the estimates for the other two-digit industries in the division. In
order to prevent the secondary disclosure, the county estimate of earnings
for another SIC two-digit industry is suppressed.
<P>
A complementary disclosure results from the derivation of the primary disclosure
of the county estimate of earnings for an SIC two-digit industry from the
State estimate of earnings for the industry and from the estimates for the
other counties in the State. In order to prevent the complementary disclosure,
the county estimate of earnings for the industry in another county is suppressed.
<P>
In addition, the State estimates at the SIC two-digit level and the county
estimates at the SIC industry-division level are checked for these disclosures.
<P>
78. </A>In this test, computer programs impose a set of rules
and priorities on this matrix so that the estimates that should be suppressed
are selected until indirect disclosure is impossible.
<P>
79. </A>Using the "disturbing" technique alters a number just
enough to prevent disclosure but not enough to impair the usefulness of the
information.
<P>
80. </A>Executive Office of the President, Office of Management
and Budget, Statistical Policy Division, <em>Standard Industrial Classification
Manual, 1967</em> (Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office (GPO),
1967); <em>Manual, 1972</em> (GPO, 1972); <em>Manual, 1987</em> (GPO, 1987).
<P>
81. </A>After interpolation or extrapolation is used to calculate
the preliminary State or county estimates, the estimates are adjusted; the
State estimates are adjusted by allocation to sum to the national estimate
for the income component; the county estimates are adjusted by allocation
to sum to the State estimates.
<P>
82. </A>Straight-line interpolation is the simplest, but the
least satisfactory, of the methods of interpolation. Its use is based on
the premise that the magnitude of the annual change is the same in each year
in the interpolated time series.
<P>
83. </A>Interpolation with a related series is based on the
premise that the relationship between the benchmark data and the data from
the related series changes at a uniform rate over time.
<P>
This procedure uses straight-line interpolation of benchmark-year ratios
to calculate ratios for the intervening years. A benchmark-year ratio is
the ratio of the data for an income component for the benchmark year to the
data from the annual series that is related to the component. The interpolated
ratios are then multiplied by the data for the intervening years from the
related series to yield the preliminary estimates for these years.
<P>
84. </A>Extrapolation with a related series is based on the
premise that the relationship of the data for the income component for the
latest benchmark year to the benchmark-year data from the related series
remains unchanged in the subsequent year or years.
<P>
85. </A>The regulation of flows by farmers extends their earnings
cycles, so they can survive losses or reduced income for 2 or 3 years.
<P>
86. </A>For a more detailed discussion, see Thae S. Park,
"Relationship Between Personal Income and Adjusted
Gross Income, 1991&#8211;92," <em>Survey</em> 74 (August 1994):
51&#8211;53.
<P>
87. </A>The estimates of money income for 1989 were prepared
from data from the 1990 Census of Population.
<P>
For the Nation and for the four census regions, the Census Bureau also prepares
annual estimates of money income from the data from the current population
survey.
<P>
88. </A>The Census Bureau uses this method because the decennial
census requests information about the income for the previous year: In April
1990, the Census Bureau asked how much income was received in calendar year
1989.
<P>
89. </A>Personal tax payments of both real estate taxes and
sales taxes. Real estate taxes are excluded because expenses that are deducted
from both gross monetary rental income and gross imputed rental income in
order to obtain net rental income. Sales taxes are included in personal
consumption expenditures.
<P>
90. </A>See <A HREF="#place">"Place of measurement of the
source data" </A>in the introduction to the "Sources and Methods."
<P>
91. </A>The estimates of the components that are derived from
the place-of-work data are presented both by place of work and by place of
residence.
<P>
92. </A>An establishment is an economic unit usually at one
location, that conducts business, provides services, or performs industrial
operations.
