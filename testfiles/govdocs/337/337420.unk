By the Commission:

                         I.  INTRODUCTION
     1.   In the Universal Service Order and the Access Charge Reform Order we
concluded that the $3.50 cap on the subscriber line charge (SLC) for primary residential and
single-line businesses should remain unchanged.  In the Access Charge Reform Order, however,
we adjusted the SLC caps for additional residential and business lines.  We also created a
presubscribed interexchange carrier charge (PICC) that will, over time, supplant the traffic-
sensitive carrier common line charge (CCLC).  Under our new access charge rules, in 1998 SLC
and PICC levels for primary residential and single-line business lines will be lower than the levels
prescribed for secondary residential and multi-line business lines.  As a result of these changes,
we must establish criteria to identify primary residential lines for the purpose of determining SLC
and PICC levels.

     2.   In this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), we seek comment on whether
we should retain the definition of "single line-line business line" set forth in the Commission's
rules.  In addition, we seek comment on how we should define "primary residential line."  We
tentatively conclude that end user self-certification should be used to identify primary lines.  We
also tentatively conclude that we should use audits to verify primary residential line counts.  We
also discuss enforcement of our rules, consider a mandatory uniform consumer disclosure
statement, and seek comment on privacy issues raised by the proposals we present.

                         II.  BACKGROUND
     3.   In our Access Charge Reform Order, we changed our access charge rules so that
non-traffic sensitive costs would no longer be recovered through traffic-sensitive interstate access
charges.  We directed incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs) to recover non-traffic sensitive
costs through non-traffic sensitive charges because this method of recovery is more economically
efficient.  One non-traffic sensitive cost of providing interstate access is the common line, or
"local loop," which connects an end user's home or business to an ILEC's central office.  The
jurisdictional separations process divides certain ILEC costs between interstate and intrastate
operations.  The Commission's separations rules currently assign 25 percent of ILECs' loop costs
to the interstate jurisdiction.  The state public utility commission then specifies how rate-regulated
ILECs may recover the costs assigned to intrastate operations.  We provide for an opportunity to
recover the revenue assigned to the interstate operations through our access charge rules. 
ILECs subject to the Commission's price cap rules (price cap ILECs) currently recover the costs
of the loop through a combination of SLCs and CCLCs.

     4.   Under the rules we established in our Access Charge Reform Order, the traffic-
sensitive CCLC for price cap ILECs will be gradually eliminated, replaced by the flat-rated, non-
traffic sensitive PICC.  We prescribed the PICC because we adopted the recommendation of the
Federal-State Joint Board on Universal Service (Joint Board) to retain the current SLC cap of
$3.50 for primary residential and single-line businesses because such lines "are central to the
provision of universal service," and the SLC "has an impact on universal service concerns such as
affordability."  Because of the level of the cap on SLCs for those lines, most price cap ILECs
will not be able to recover, through the SLC, all of the common line revenues permitted under our
price cap rules.  Thus, to allow price cap ILECs to recover the remaining non-traffic sensitive
common line revenues through a non-traffic sensitive charge, we created the PICC, which is a flat,
per-line charge assessed on the end user's presubscribed interexchange carrier (PIC).  In order to
eliminate the incentive for customers to avoid the PICC by using "dial-around" long distance
carriers instead of presubscribing to an interexchange carrier, we concluded that price cap ILECs
may charge the PICC directly to an end user that does not select a PIC.  Only price cap ILECs
will charge SLCs that have a higher cap for lines other than the primary residential and single-line
businesses lines and only these ILECs will charge PICCs.  ILECs that are not subject to the
Commission's price cap rules will continue to charge a SLC that is capped at $3.50 for residential
lines and $6.00 for business lines and will not charge a PICC.  Moreover, the cost recovery of
competitive LECs, and therefore the fee structures of competitive LECs, are not regulated by the
Commission.  Accordingly, although this NPRM focuses on price cap ILECs, we also solicit
comment on whether the various proposals set forth in this NPRM for defining, identifying, and
verifying primary lines for price cap ILECs could also be applied for rate-of-return ILECs if, in a
future proceeding, the Commission concludes that all ILECs should assess SLCs and PICCs that
are higher for secondary lines.

                         III.  DISCUSSION
A.   Defining Single-line Business Lines and Primary Residential Lines

     5.   Single-line businesses.  Our access rules already require price cap ILECs to
distinguish between multiple-line businesses and single-line businesses in order to charge different
SLCs for these entities.  In addition, we note that ILECs currently distinguish between
residential and business customers to charge different rates embodied in state tariffs.  We invite
parties to describe the methods carriers use to distinguish multiple-line businesses from single-line
businesses and to distinguish between residential and business customers, and seek comment on
whether the Commission should revise its rules or policies to ensure the correct SLCs and PICCs
are assessed on these lines.  In particular, we note that section 69.104(h) defines a single-line
business line.  It states:  "A line shall be deemed to be a single line business line if the subscriber
pays a rate that is not described as a residential rate in the local exchange service tariff and does
not obtain more than one such line from a particular telephone company."  In the Access Charge
Reform Order, we defined the term "telephone company" for the purposes of part 69 of our rules,
to mean an "incumbent LEC" as that term is defined in section 251(h)(1) of the Act.  We seek
comment on whether we should alter this definition.  We seek comment on whether maintaining
this definition would be favorable because, given that only price cap ILECs will assess different
SLCs and PICCs on multi-line businesses, maintaining this definition would allow incumbent
LECs to assess the correct SLCs and PICCs without determining whether a customer receives
service from other carriers.  We note however, that if we maintain this definition, a business that
obtains one line from an ILEC and one line from a competitive LEC or a wireless carrier would be
treated as a single-line business for the purposes of its SLC and PICC.  We seek comment on
whether this outcome would be competitively neutral and whether it would be consistent with the
Joint Board's recommendations with respect to the level of the primary line SLC.  We further
seek comment on whether a business with a single line in each of two locations should be
considered a single-line business.

     6.   Primary residential line.  We seek comment on how we should define "primary
residential line."  Specifically, we seek comment on whether the primary residential line should be
defined as the primary line of an individual subscriber, of a residence, of an individual household,
or on another basis.  We note, for example, that the current Lifeline rules limit Lifeline support
to "a single telephone line to the household's primary residence."  Commenters should identify
the relative costs and benefits of adopting a particular definition.  For example, defining the
primary line as the primary line to a primary residence would not allow two households in a single
residence each to subscribe to a line that is subject to the primary-line level SLC and PICC (i.e.,
one of the two lines would be subject to the higher SLC and PICC).  Conversely, defining the
primary line in terms of a subscriber's residence may have the advantage of being administratively
simple and less invasive of subscribers' privacy because it does not require the gathering of
information regarding subscriber living arrangements that would be needed to identify households. 
We seek comment on these issues.

     7.   Parties that favor defining the primary residential line in terms of "subscribers,"
"residences," "households," or any other term, should propose definitions of such terms, including
definitions used by other entities.  For example, if we defined the primary residential line in terms
of households, we could base our definition on the definition of "household" used by either the
U.S. Census Bureau or the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).  We seek comment on whether to
use either definition.  Because individuals complete income tax returns annually and census forms
decennially, we find it likely that consumers have more experience applying the definition of a
household used by the IRS than they do applying the definition used by the U.S. Census Bureau. 
We seek comment on whether consumer familiarity should be a factor in deciding what definition
to adopt.  We ask parties to identify other definitions that may be easily applied by consumers and
carriers alike.  Additionally, we ask parties to estimate, to the extent possible, the number of lines
that will be classified as primary residential lines under any definition that they support.  Parties
should also discuss how the definition of the primary residential line we select will affect the
Commission's ability to verify the number of such lines, as discussed below.

B.   Identification of Primary Residential Lines

     8.   Information Required to Identify Primary Residential Lines.  We tentatively
conclude that, although an ILEC's business records likely distinguish between single-line and
multi-line customers, and between residential and business customers, those records may be
inadequate to identify the primary residential line.  For example, if we define primary residential
line in terms of households, if one household has multiple residences served by different carriers,
or if a household has multiple lines to the same location served by different carriers, the records of
one price cap ILEC will be insufficient to identify the single line to the subscriber's primary
residence for which the lower SLC and PICC will be charged.  Furthermore, depending on the
definition of primary line we adopt, we tentatively conclude that carriers' records may be
insufficient to identify when they are allowed to charge primary-line level SLCs and PICCs for
more than one line to a single location.  For these reasons, we tentatively conclude that
identifying a primary residential line requires:  (1) identification of the subscriber, residence, or
household (depending on the definition adopted); (2) identification of the primary residence of the
subscriber or household; and (3) identification of the primary line, and of the incumbent LEC and
interexchange carrier serving that line.  We seek comment on these tentative conclusions.

     9.   Using Customer Self-Certification to Collect Information.  In response to the
Joint Board's recommendation to provide high cost support only for primary residential lines,
several commenters, including Sprint and Teleport, proposed, in the Universal Service
proceeding, that the Commission use a method of customer self-certification to identify primary
lines.  We tentatively conclude that the Commission should permit price cap ILECs to use
customer self-certification to identify primary lines for access charge purposes.  We make this
tentative conclusion because such an approach presumably would minimize the substantial
administrative costs that would be inherent in any effort to require carriers or the Commission to
identify primary residential lines without information from the customer.  The burden that self-
certification will impose on individual customers would be significantly less than the burden that
ILECs would otherwise bear to identify each of their customers' primary line independent of the
customer.  

     10.  We seek comment on the language that would have to be posed to subscribers to
determine which is their primary residential line under such a self-certification proposal.  We seek
comment on whether we should adopt uniform language, or whether carriers should devise their
own method of acquiring this information.  For example, a uniform statement might prevent
ILECs from intentionally or inadvertently wording the question in a way that encourages incorrect
responses from their customers.  We seek comment on whether LECs should be required to
inform customers of the consequences of providing false information or designating more than
one line as a primary line.  We seek comment on how often this information should be collected. 
We tentatively conclude that this information should be collected once from all customers
currently being served by price cap ILECs, and thereafter only at the time a customer orders
service from a price cap ILEC.  We seek comment on procedures that could be used to identify
when customers switch service to a competing carrier.  We also tentatively conclude that price
cap ILECs should be required to maintain documentation of their customers' self-certification that
is adequate to permit verification of the number of primary lines an ILEC reportedly serves.  We
seek comment on whether documentation could be accomplished by permitting customers to
provide oral certification that is noted in the price cap ILEC's records or whether customers
should be required to self-certify in writing.  We also seek comment on how long these ILECs
should be required to maintain documentation of customer self-certification.  In addition, we seek
comment on what action the price cap ILEC should take if a customer fails to provide a self-
certification.  We seek comment on any other administrative procedures parties recommend to
implement a self-certification method of identifying primary residential lines, and are particularly
interested in proposals that will reduce the administrative burden on carriers and customers.  

     11.  Resellers.  In our Access Charge Reform Order, we concluded that, to address the
concerns of some commenters that charging a higher SLC for second and additional residential
lines might encourage subscribers to order additional lines from non-ILECs, price cap ILECs
would be permitted to charge the higher SLC to competitive LECs providing secondary lines to a
customer by reselling the price cap ILECs' wholesale service.  We seek comment on how to
identify secondary lines for this purpose.  We seek comment on whether the Commission should
require resellers to identify the primary and secondary lines of their customers and relay that
information to price cap ILECs, or, whether price cap ILECs should identify the primary and
secondary lines for resellers' customers directly.  We seek comment on whether, if, for example, a
reseller collected customer certifications, the reseller should pass along the original copies of its
customers' certifications to the price cap ILEC from which it is purchasing wholesale service.  We
invite alternative proposals, and encourage parties to suggest proposals that will accurately
identify the secondary lines served by resellers and will be administratively simple to implement.

     12.  National Database Proposals.  We request comment on other methods for
identifying primary residential lines for purposes of our access charge rules.  For example, in
discussing the Joint Board's proposal to identify primary lines for purposes of universal service
support, Teleport suggested that the Customer Account Record Exchange (CARE) database,
which is maintained by each LEC and includes the service address for every customer in the LEC's
service territory, serve as the basis for a database that lists customer addresses and whether the
customer at each address subscribes to one line or more than one line.  Under the Teleport
proposal, customers that are served by more than one carrier would designate one of those
carriers as their primary local exchange carrier.  
    
     13.  Similarly, MFS submitted a proposal for tracking lines in order to determine
universal service support levels.  MFS suggested the compilation of a national database of the
nine-digit zip codes corresponding to the location of subscribers in high cost areas.  In instances
in which the nine-digit zip code is insufficient to identify a specific household, MFS recommended
that the database should also include the customer's last name and street address.  Like Teleport,
MFS proposed that customers who are served by more than one carrier designate one carrier as
their primary local exchange carrier and that this information be included in the database.  MFS
contends that a system using zip codes would be automated and auditable. 

     14.  We note that both of these proposals assume that "primary residential line" will be
defined as the primary line to a consumer's residence.  As discussed above, we seek comment on
the appropriate definition of "primary residential line."  In addition, both proposals require
customers who subscribe to more than one line to designate their primary line.  Thus, a database
would have to be used in conjunction with customer self-certification and could not be used
independently to identify primary residential lines regardless of how that term is defined. 
Although databases maintained by price cap ILECs could be useful to those ILECs for retaining
customer records, we tentatively conclude that we will not use a national database, maintained by
the Commission or another entity on a nation-wide basis, to track primary residential lines or
single-line businesses for two reasons.  First, such a database is not necessary to implement our
access charge rules.  Second, the administrative resources necessary to create such a database
might outweigh any additional accuracy gained from this approach.

     15.  Other proposals.  We tentatively conclude that we will not pursue several other
approaches presented by commenters in the Universal Service proceeding.  We tentatively
conclude that we will not adopt Teleport's proposal to use county and municipal records and
databases to identify addresses of individuals.  We tentatively conclude that, because this
information is dispersed throughout the country in a variety of formats, it would be
administratively burdensome to use this information.  Because these records are maintained
primarily for deed ownership and property tax purposes, we also tentatively conclude that such
records are unlikely to reveal unequivocally a customer's primary residence or whether a customer
subscribes to more than one telephone line.  We also tentatively conclude, for the reasons
articulated by MFS and to protect the privacy of consumers, that social security numbers should
not be used to track primary residential lines.  

     16.  Privacy Issues.  We encourage parties to comment on any potential issues related
to subscriber privacy that may be raised by the customer self-certification proposal discussed
above.  Specifically, we seek comment on whether requiring consumers to provide information to
their price cap ILECs regarding the identification of their households and primary residences
would be consistent with those consumers' reasonable expectations of privacy and whether the
Privacy Act would apply to the collection of self-certifications by ILECs.  We tentatively
conclude that we should require ILECs that collect this information to use this information only
for the purposes of determining the correct SLC and PICC for individual consumers' lines, and
not disclose it or permit access to it for any other purposes.  We request comment on whether
primary line information would constitute customer proprietary network information as defined in
section 222(f)(1) of the Act.  We seek comment on whether sections 222(c)(1), (d)(1), (d)(2),
other parts of section 222, or other sections of the Act present exceptions that would allow
carriers to disclose primary line information to the Commission, or another entity selected by the
Commission, without customer approval.  

C.   Verifying Primary Residential Line Information

     17.  We tentatively conclude the Commission should implement a method to verify the
number of primary lines served by a carrier, identified through customer self-certification.  We
note that, under our access charge rules, if a price cap ILEC chooses not to charge customers
with second residential lines the higher SLC allowed by our rules, we do not permit them to
recover these foregone revenues through the PICCs or CCLCs.  Verification might be warranted
if a PIC files a complaint with the Commission articulating its suspicion that a price cap ILEC is
over-reporting the number of primary lines in its service area.  For example, a price cap ILEC
might attempt to market secondary lines to end users as primary lines, on which the lower SLC
would be assessed, and make up the difference in other rates. This potential incentive may be
intensified because, as the new access charge rate structure is phased in, PICCs for primary lines
will be higher than PICCs for secondary residential lines and multi-line business lines.  In addition,
verification might be warranted if the Commission, during the course of analyzing statistical data,
identifies erratic numbers that would indicate that a price cap ILEC might have misreported the
number of primary lines it serves.  In light of the potential incentives for carriers to misreport the
number of lines to which the end users subscribe, we tentatively conclude that we should adopt a
method of verifying the number of primary lines served by price cap ILECs.  

     18.  Audits.  One method of verifying the number of primary-line SLCs and PICCs
assessed by price cap ILECs would be to audit the ILECs' records.  As discussed above, we
tentatively conclude that price cap ILECs should retain records of customer self-certification
sufficient to permit verification of the number of primary lines that they serve. Although the
Commission has broad authority to audit telecommunications carriers' records, we seek
comment on whether audits would be an effective way to examine discrepancies in the number of
primary lines a carrier serves and the number of primary-line SLCs and PICCs the carrier charges. 
Such audits would utilize appropriate auditing techniques and procedures to verify the number of
primary-line SLCs and PICCs assessed by price cap ILECs.  We tentatively conclude that audits
of the ILEC's records could be performed to determine whether the ILEC misreported primary
lines.  We seek comment on our tentative conclusion to use audits to verify primary lines and on
the type of audit that would be most effective and efficient.  We also seek comment on what
controls or procedures should be implemented that would protect against the possibility of a price
cap ILEC misreporting primary lines.

     19.  Models.  In the context of formulating a forward-looking economic cost
mechanism to estimate the cost of providing service in high cost areas, the proponents of the
Hatfield model have developed a method for estimating the number of primary lines in a census
block.  Starting from a 1995 estimate of households by the Census Bureau, Hatfield 3.1
estimates the residential line counts for each census block group (CBG).  It removes from the
total number of households those without telephones (according to 1990 Census information) and
adds second lines for some households using an estimated correlation between second lines and
CBG data about the income and age of consumers.  We seek comment on whether this method,
or another modeling approach, could assist the Commission in verifying the number of primary
lines served by price cap ILECs.  Specifically, we seek comment on whether the Commission
could use the estimates generated by the Hatfield model in conjunction with an audit.  For
example, the Commission could compare the estimates of primary lines in certain CBGs within a
price cap ILEC's service area and audit those CBGs in which the Hatfield estimates are not within
a certain range of the ILEC's reported number of primary lines.  We also seek comment on
whether the Hatfield approach would have to be modified to account for second homes.  In
addition, we note that the Commission recently collected data on, inter alia, the number of loops
served by carriers and the number of residential customers that subscribe to more than one line. 
We seek comment on whether these data would assist in verifying primary line counts.  

D.   Enforcement

     20.  We seek comment on available methods for the Commission to enforce its access
charge rules, which impose different maximum SLCs and PICCs depending on whether a line is a
primary or secondary line.  We seek comment on whether the Commission's authority under
sections 4(i), 206-209, 312, 403, and 503 of the Communications Act of 1934, and the
provisions of Title 18 of the United States Code is sufficient to deter fraud or misrepresentation
by carriers or consumers that may arise under the customer self-certification approach.  We
tentatively conclude that we should require carriers to notify their customers of the requirement to
identify a single primary local exchange carrier and a single primary residence.  We request
comment on this tentative conclusion.  We also seek comment on whether we should adopt
measures to deter consumers from identifying more than one primary line.

     21.  We also seek comment on what types of sanctions would be appropriate and
consistent with the Commission's statutory authority to punish violations of our rules regarding
the identification of primary lines and request comment on whether section 222(c)(1) or any other
portion of section 222 provides adequate authority to prevent misuse of the information that
carriers collect.  We tentatively conclude that, if the Commission, as a result of an audit or other
method of verifying primary line counts, discovered that a price cap ILEC had misreported the
number of primary lines it serves, the Commission could take the following actions:  (1) order the
price cap ILEC to correct its billing practices and assess SLCs and PICCs at the correct level; (2)
impose forfeitures pursuant to 47 U.S.C.  220(d) or 503(b) for violations of the Commission's
rules; and (3) require the price cap ILEC to have an independent auditor conduct audits of its
records at regular intervals determined by the Commission.  We seek comment on these tentative
conclusions.

E.   Consumer Disclosure

     22.  The new distinction between primary and secondary residential lines may cause
customer confusion.  We seek comment, therefore, on whether the Commission should require
carriers to provide consumers with a uniform disclosure statement describing this distinction.  We
tentatively conclude that such a disclosure requirement would be consistent with applicable First
Amendment standards and invite comment on that conclusion.  We seek comment on whether, for
example, all local exchange carriers that charge a SLC should be required to make the following
statement:  

     The subscriber line charge is a fee collected by your local telephone company to
     defray part of the costs of providing telephone service.  The subscriber line charge
     covers the costs that can be attributed to providing customers with the ability to
     place telephone calls across state lines.  In order to ensure that all customers have
     affordable access to local telephone service, the Federal Communications
     Commission allows your local telephone company to charge no more than $3.50
     for the subscriber line charge for each primary residential line.  For additional lines,
     the Federal Communications Commission allows local telephone companies to
     charge no more than $5.00 per line for the subscriber line charge in 1998.

We seek comment on whether this statement will be easily understood by all consumers.  We
invite alternate suggestions for a uniform consumer disclosure statement.  We seek comment on
whether this statement should be given orally at the time when a subscriber orders telephone
service.  We seek comment on whether this statement should be provided in writing to all
consumers when the change takes effect.  We seek comment on how, if we adopt a consumer
disclosure statement including a reference to the SLC cap on secondary lines, such disclosure
statement should indicate the annual increases in the SLC cap.  We seek comment on whether
such a statement would be compatible with marketing and consumer information campaigns that
carriers may have instituted or that they may be formulating in preparation for the Commission's
new access charge rules.

           IV.  PROCEDURAL MATTERS AND ORDERING CLAUSE
A.   Ex Parte Presentations

     23.  This is a permit-but-disclose notice-and-comment rulemaking proceeding.  Ex
parte presentations are permitted, except during the Sunshine Agenda period, provided that they
are disclosed as provided in the Commission's rules.

B.   Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis

     24.  Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Commission has prepared
this Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) of the expected significant economic impact of
these proposed policies and rules on small entities.  Written public comments are requested on the
IRFA.  These comments must be filed in accordance with the same filing deadlines as comments
on the rest of this NPRM, and should have a separate and distinct heading designating them as
responses to the IRFA.  The Commission will send a copy of this NPRM, including the IRFA, to
the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration (SBA) in accordance with
the RFA.

     25.  Need for and Objectives of the Proposed Rules.  Three principal goals of the
Telecommunications Act of 1996 are:  (1) opening local exchange and exchange access markets
to competition; (2) promoting increased competition in telecommunications markets that are
already open to competition, particularly long distance services markets; and (3) reforming our
system of universal service so that universal service is preserved and advanced as local exchange
and exchange access markets move from monopoly to competition.  The Commission's access
charge and universal service rules were adopted at a time when interstate access and local
exchange services were offered on a monopoly basis, and in many cases are inconsistent with the
competitive market envisioned by the 1996 Act.  This NPRM is necessary to implement the rules
the Commission adopted in its Universal Service Order and Access Charge Reform Orderbecause, without a definition and a means of identifying and verifying primary residential lines,
price cap ILECs will not be able to assess the appropriate charges for these lines.  With this
NPRM, we seek to identify primary residential lines in order to make the Commission's access
charge and universal service rules consistent with Sections 251 and 254 of the
Telecommunications Act of 1996.

     26.  Legal Basis.  The proposed action is supported by Sections 4(i), 4(j), 201-205,
251, 254, and 403 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C.  154(i), 154(j),
201-205, 251, 254, and 403.

     27.  Description and Estimate of the Number of Small Entities That May Be Affected
by this NPRM.  The RFA directs the Commission to provide a description of, and where feasible,
and estimate of the number of small entities that might be affected by proposed rules.  The RFA
defines the term "small entity" as having the same meaning as the term "small business," "small
organization," and "small business concern" under section 3 of the Small Business Act (SBA). 
To be a small business concern, an entity must:  (1) be independently owned and operated; (2) be
not dominant in its field of operation; and (3) meet any additional criteria established by the
SBA.

     28.  We believe that small ILECs are not small businesses for IRFA purposes because
each is either dominant in its field of operation or is not independently owned and operated.  We
have found ILECs to be "dominant in their field of operation" since the early 1980s, and we
consistently have certified under the Regulatory Flexibility Act that ILECs are not subject to
regulatory flexibility analysis requirements because they are not "small business concerns."  Out
of an abundance of caution, for regulatory flexibility analysis purposes we will consider small
ILECs within this present analysis and use the term "small ILECs" to refer to any incumbent LEC
that arguably might be defined by SBA as a small business concern.

     29.  The proposals under consideration in this NPRM, if adopted, would affect the
fourteen (14) ILECs subject to price cap regulation by the Commission.  Neither the Commission
nor the SBA has developed a definition of small providers of local exchange service.  The closest
applicable definition under SBA rules is for telephone telecommunications companies other than
radiotelephone (wireless) companies.  The SBA has defined a small business for Standard
Industrial Classification (SIC) category 4813 (Telephone Communications, Except
Radiotelephone) to be an entity with no more than 1,500 employees.  Of the fourteen ILECs
subject to price cap regulation, we estimate that, at a maximum, six (6) of them have no more
than 1,500 employees.  Of these six, we estimate that at least one is not independently owned and
operated.  We seek comment on these estimates.

     30.  In addition, the proposals in this NPRM may also affect providers of local
exchange service that purchase wholesale services from the 14 incumbent price cap LECs and
resell that service to customers.  Neither the Commission nor the SBA has developed a definition
of small entities specifically applicable to resellers.  The closest applicable  SBA definition for a
reseller is a telephone communications company except radiotelephone (wireless) companies. 
However, the most reliable source of information regarding the number of resellers nationwide is
the data that the Commission collects annually in connection with the TRS Worksheet.  According
to our most recent data, 260 companies reported that they were engaged in the resale of
telephone service.  We estimate that between 50 and 150 of these companies offer local exchange
service on a resale basis, but we do not have data regarding how many of these carriers purchase
service from price cap ILECs.  We also do not have information on the number of these carriers
that are not independently owned and operated or have more than 1,500 employees, and thus we
are unable at this time to estimate with greater precision the number of resellers that would qualify
as small entities or small incumbent LEC concerns under the SBA's definition.  Consequently, we
estimate that there are fewer than 150 small entity resellers.

     31.  Reporting, record keeping, and other compliance requirements.  The proposals to
establish a customer certification system amy require price cap ILECs to ask customers to identify
their primary lines, maintain records verifying a customer's primary line designation, submit
their records to Commission audits to verify accuracy of primary line counts, and publish a
consumer disclosure statement in their monthly bills. 

     32.  Steps Taken to Minimize Significant Economic Impact on Small Entities and
Alternatives Considered.  Throughout this NPRM, we seek comment on alternatives that will
reduce the impact on all entities affected by these proposals, including small ILECs.  We
tentatively adopt a definition of single-line business lines that, we believe, will result in a smaller
administrative burden for ILECs as they identify primary and secondary lines in order to charge
the correct SLC or PICC.  In addition, we ask commenters to identify the relative costs and
benefits, including administrative costs, of adopting a particular definition of primary residential
line.  We ask parties to identify a definition of primary residential line that will be easy for carriers
and customers to apply.  We tentatively adopt customer self-certification as a means to identify
primary lines because this method of identification is less administratively burdensome for ILECs
than a method that does not include customer input.  We seek comment on whether, and if so, the
amount of time, ILECs must keep records of customer self-certification.  We particularly
encourage parties to submit proposals that will reduce the administrative burden on carriers and
customers.  We seek comment on whether we should include a standardized customer disclosure
statement, and if so, whether that disclosure should be made in writing or may be made orally.

     33.  At this time, we tentatively conclude to eliminate several options because they
would be too administratively burdensome.  The proposals we tentatively reject include:  creating
and maintaining a national database of primary line designations; using local property records to
identify and track primary lines; and using social security numbers to track primary lines.

     34.  Federal rules which overlap, duplicate or conflict with this rule.  None.

C.   Initial Paperwork Reduction Act Analysis

     35.  This NPRM contains a proposed information collection.  As part of its continuing
effort to reduce paperwork burdens, we invite the general public and the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) to take this opportunity to comment on the information collections contained
in this NPRM, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, Pub. L. No. 104-13. 
Public and agency comments are due at the same time as other comments on this NPRM; OMB
comments are due 60 days from  date of publication of this NPRM in the Federal Register. 
Comments should address: (a) whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for the
proper performance of the functions of the Commission, including whether the information shall
have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the Commission's burden estimates; (c) ways to enhance
the quality, utility, and clarity of the information collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of
the collection of information on the respondents, including the use of automated collection
techniques or other form of information technology.
