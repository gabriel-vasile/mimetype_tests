    4, 64 Stat. 785).
      Section consolidates part of section 111 of title 13, U.S.C.,
    1952 ed., with section 113 of such title which also related to
    statistics with respect to crime and to the "defective, dependent,
    and delinquent classes".
      "Secretary", meaning the Secretary of Commerce, was substituted
    for "Director of the Census" to conform with Reorganization Plan
    No. 5, Secs. 1, 2, eff. May 24, 1950, 15 F.R. 3174, 64 Stat. 1263.
    See Revision Note to section 4 of this title.
      The provisions of section 111 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed.,
    authorizing statistics relating to transportation by water, and
    express business, to mines, mining, quarries, and minerals, to
    savings banks and other savings institutions, mortgage, loan, and
    investment companies, and similar institutions, and to street
    railways, electric light and power, telephone, and telegraph
    business, were omitted as superseded and covered by sections 121-
    123 of such title (enacted in 1948), which are set out elsewhere
    in this title. See Distribution Table.
      Section 111 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., also authorized the
    decennial collection of statistics relating to the fishing industry
    "in cooperation with the Fish and Wildlife Service". In the basic
    statutory provision (see amendment by act June 7, 1906, ch. 3048,
    34 Stat. 218, "Fish and Wildlife Service" read "Bureau of
    Fisheries" and it was changed, by the codifiers, in such section
    111 to the former designation because of 1940 Reorganization Plan
    No. III, Sec. 3, 5 F.R. 2107, 54 Stat. 1232, which consolidated the
    Bureau of Fisheries and the Bureau of Biological Survey into one
    agency to be known as the "Fish and Wildlife Service". However, at
    the time of the enactment of the 1906 act, referred to above, both
    the Bureau of the Fisheries, and the Census Bureau (then referred
    to as the "Census Office"), were in the Department of Commerce. The
    Bureau of Fisheries was transferred to the Department of the
    Interior by 1939 Reorganization Plan No. II, Sec. 4(e), 4 F.R.
    2731, 53 Stat. 1431, and it is within that department that the Fish
    and Wildlife Service now functions. Therefore, such provision in
    section 111 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., has been omitted from
    this revised title as obsolete. In any event section 121 of title
    13, U.S.C., 1952 ed. (subchapter I of chapter 5 of this revised
    title) is broad enough to authorize such collection.
      The provisions of section 111 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed.,
    which authorized statistics relating to religion, and the
    provisions thereof which related to the designation of reports, are
    set out as separate sections in this subchapter; and the provisions
    thereof which related to the preparation of schedules, and which
    authorized the appointment of special agents, are set out in
    chapter 1 of this title. See Distribution Table.
      The proviso in section 111 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., which
    prohibited the collection of statistics relating to religious or
    church membership when the disclosure of such information was
    prohibited by religious or church doctrine, teaching or discipline,
    has been incorporated in chapter 7 of this title. See Distribution
    Table.

                       HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES                   
      Based on title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., Sec. 111 (Mar. 6, 1902, ch.
    139, Sec. 7, 32 Stat. 52; June 7, 1906, ch. 3048, 34 Stat. 218;
    June 18, 1929, ch. 28, Sec. 3, 46 Stat. 21; 1939 Reorganization
    Plan No. II, Sec. 4(e), eff. July 1, 1939, 4 F.R. 2731, 53 Stat.
    1431; 1940 Reorganization Plan No. III, Sec. 3, eff. June 30, 1940,
    5 F.R. 2107, 54 Stat. 1232; June 25, 1947, ch. 124, 61 Stat. 163;
    Sept. 7, 1950, ch. 910, Sec. 4, 64 Stat. 785).
      Section was taken from that part of section 111 of title 13,
    U.S.C., 1952 ed., which related to designation of reports prepared
    under that section. For remainder of such section 111, see this
    subchapter, and Distribution Table.
      Section 111 of title 13, U.S.C. 1952 ed., provided that the
    reports prepared under the provisions of that section should be
    designated as "Special Reports of the Census Office". In this
    revised section it is provided that such reports shall be
    designated as " 'Special Reports' followed by the name of whatever
    bureau or agency of the Department of Commerce is designated by the
    Secretary to collect and compile such statistics". This change
    conforms with 1950 Reorganization Plan No. 5, Secs. 1, 2, eff. May
    24, 1950, 15 F.R. 3174, 64 Stat. 1263, which transferred the
    functions of all agencies, bureaus, officers, and employees of the
    Department of Commerce to the Secretary, and vested power in him to
    delegate any of such transferred functions, or any of his other
    functions, to any of such agencies, bureaus, officers, or
    employees. See section 4 of this title.
      Changes were made in phraseology.
      Section 7 of the act of Mar. 6, 1902, ch. 139, 32 Stat. 52, cited
    above, from which section 111 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., was
    derived, contained additional provisions (which were not classified
    to the United States Code) relating to the duty of the Director of
    the Census to publish the Official Register of the United States,
    and to the transmission to him of the data to be included therein.
    Such provisions have been omitted as they were superseded by act
    Mar. 3, 1925, ch. 421, Sec. 2(a)(b), 43 Stat. 1105, which was
    formerly classified to section 3 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., and
    which, in turn, was repealed by section 5 of act Aug. 28, 1935, ch.
    795, 49 Stat. 957, and superseded by sections 1 and 2 of that act.
    Such sections 1 and 2, as amended, are classified to section 654 of
    title 5, U.S.C., 1952 ed., Executive Departments and Government
    Officers and Employees. Under that section, the Official Register
    is published by the Civil Service Commission. Provisions relating
    to its distribution are contained in sections 139, 139a and 280a of
    title 44, U.S.C., 1952 ed., Public Printing and Documents.
