				<p>All letters in the Oblas collection were digitized; selected letters and postcards have been transcribed.</p>
			</samplingDecl>
			<editorialDecl>
				<p>Documents are transcribed with minimal changes to the original text in an effort to preserve original appearance, content, and idiosyncrasies of composition.  Period language and terminology are also retained.  Transcription is literal with regard to the writer's capitalization, punctuation, spelling, and visible corrections (i.e. crossed out words).   Spelling errors are indicated with [sic]; however, recurring errors in spelling or grammar within  a single document have been marked the first time and and not subsequently.  Crossed out words are presented {in braces}.  Any special emphasis (i.e. underlining) is presented *between asterisks*.  When the writer spells out the word "and" it appears spelled out; when a symbol is used for "and" the editor used the ampersand.</p>
				<p>Alterations to the original text are consistent throughout and all editorial comments appear in [square brackets]: a single space is placed between sentences, nontextual symbols (circled page numbers, scribbles, etc.) have been changed to plain typographical characters when possible or omitted with a note, obvious slips of the pen have been silently corrected, and malformed letters are presented as the intended letter, based on spelling and context.  All superscripts and underscored superscripts have been lowered to the regular line of text and are not underscored.  Single word interlineations are indicated with a single caret (^) before the word; multiple word interlineations are presented ^surrounded by carets^.</p>

		<p>1930 N.T.</p>
				<p>Dearest <rs type="person" key="LO" reg="Oblas, Lilyan">Lil</rs> --</p>
				<p>Life is assuredly full at Sampson--and often I forget to tell half of what goes on. Last night we returned from Geneva at 10:30 (2230). At 1:45 A.M. I was aroused by the dormitory guard. I slipped into my clothes, leggings, pea coat and all, and out into a moonlit night to take up my guard watch which covered an area between two barracks where the clothes lines are. there they are, clothing of all descriptions whipping before a strong wind and there was I, alone except for a brilliant moon, with nothing to do but walk up &amp; down &amp; all around--or even seat [sic] down (which is strictly forbidden since watches *must* be *stood*.) During those two hours I watched a solitary rat running to a garbage pail &amp; scurrying back to a spot underneath the barracks--and later two guards on fire patrol throwing rocks at a skunk--and chatted with a chap tending the boiler rooms.</p>
				<pb id="pm0040002" n="2"/>
				<p>(interrupted at this point &amp; enticed to the movies--very good spy-melodrama, "Above Suspicion,"--continued 0630 next morning.)</p>
				<p>After my vigil ended, I clambered back into bed and slept from 0415 to 0530--and up again. C'est la vie. Luckily my watch was only two hours.</p>
				<p>In the morning Lt. Hall told me to come with him--and for the first time I rode in the station wagon shuttle to the Main Administration Building. It was a sum^mary court-martial--and a chance for me to act as a reporter. Actually, the shorthand part was very brief, a matter of a few minutes. However, there I was in the Conference Room before a Commander and several Lieutenants--and I was duly sworn in. Later, Lt. Hall expressed himself as satisfied with the work I did--simple &amp; brief as it was--his constant complaint is that ^many of^ the yeoman [sic] around the Administration Bldg. can't do reporting. I typed the record and duly recorded myself as the reporter. It looks like a beginning--and I hope it turns out that way.</p>
				<pb id="pm0040003" n="3"/>
				<p>In the afternoon I had a bit of a coughing spell--have been coughing a good deal in the last few days and using up a lot of handkerchiefs--and rushed out to drink some water. When I returned, Hall ordered me to take the rest of the afternoon off and go to sick bay. Which gave me a chance to go to bed and sleep for an hour until someone came into the barracks and turned the radio on. At 1800 went to sick bay &amp; had my temperature taken--slight rise--99% [sic]--and I had to swallow two aspirin-like pills. Imagine me trying to swallow a pill! I managed to get them to dissolve in my mouth. Also, had a spray up my nostrils.</p>
				<p>Another highlight of the day: our last injection--this one for tetanus. The pharmacist's mate injected the needle twice, into my arm because he complained my skin was too tough! I'm sure he didn't know much</p>
				<pb id="pm0040004" n="4"/>
				<p>about it! And finally the dog tags--which everyone gets after all the injections are taken. That dog tag seems to symbolize home-going, liberty, and actual acceptance into the Navy. For days everyone talked about when he was going to get his dog tag. Now we have it. It feels strange to have something tied around one's neck. I'd rather have <rs type="person" key="LO" reg="Oblas, Lilyan">my wife</rs>!</p>
				<p>This is now our fifth week at Sampson--and only 18 days to go--and everyone is eagerly anticipating that date, Nov. 2nd. Incidentally, re: your meeting me at the station, I'm afraid that is out because no information, as I understand it, will be disclosed about our train; since it is considered a troops train, it won't be listed at the railroad. Then again it may be very late--who knows?--chances are that we'll get in between 4 &amp; 6 P.M. But I think it's better for you to stay home &amp; save yourself a good deal of trouble.</p>
				<p>Received your package--glad to get my bag--also the clips &amp; mints.</p>
				<p>Love</p>
				<p><name type="person" key="IO" reg="Oblas, Irving">Irv</name></p>
				<p>(From your description, I don't think the pictures are spoiled).</p>
				<p>P.S. 0745 (AM)--Am now waiting in the dispensary for a check-up--feel much better--I am put in charge of keeping the would-be patients in line until 0800.</p>
