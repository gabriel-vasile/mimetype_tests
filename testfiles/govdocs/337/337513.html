Current   Intelligence Bulletins (CIB's) are reports issued by the National

Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Centers for Disease

Control, Atlanta, Georgia, for the purpose of disseminating new scientific

information about occupational hazards.  A CIB may draw attention to a

hazard previously unrecognized or may report new data suggesting that a

known hazard is either more or less dangerous than was previously thought.<p>



CIB's are prepared by the staff of the Division of Standards Development and

Technology Transfer,      NIOSH   (Robert A. Taft Laboratories, 4676 Columbia

Parkway, Cincinnati, Ohio 45226) and are distributed to representatives of

academia,   industry, organized  labor,  public health agencies, and public

interest groups, as well as to those federal agencies, such as the

Department of Labor, which have responsibilities for protecting the health

of workers.    It is our intention that anyone with the need to know should

have ready access to the         information contained       in these documents; we

welcome suggestions concerning their content, style, and distribution.<p>



The purpose of this bulletin is to disseminate recent information on the

potential    carcinogenicity of  4,4'-methylenedianiline  (MDA) previously

identified by NIOSH in 1976 in CIB No. 8 as 4,4'-diaminodiphenylmethane

(DDM).   In the CIB, the occupational health community was informed of the

hepatotoxicity of DDM in animals and humans and of limited evidence

regarding the potential carcinogenicity of DDM in animals.   Since 1976,

animal studies have confirmed the carcinogenic potential of MDA.  In

accordance with the Cancer Policy of the Occupational Safety and Health

Administration (OSHA) (&quot;Identification, Classification, and Regulation of

Potential Occupational Carcinogens,&quot; 29 CFR 1990), on the basis of findings

of carcinogenic and tumorigenic responses in rats and mice, NIOSH recommends

that   MDA   be   regarded   as   a potential     occupational     carcinogen.      While

estimates of the excess risk of cancer in exposed workers have not been

determined,   it is logical to assume that reducing exposure to MDA in the

workplace would reduce the potential risk.<p>



It  is   recommended    that   producers and      users   of   MDA   disseminate     this

information   to   their workers and customers, that professional and trade

associations and unions inform their members of the potential hazards of

MDA, and that appropriate engineering controls and work practices be used to

minimize exposure of workers.  Readers seeking more detailed information on

the studies referenced in the Bulletin are urged to consul the original

publications.<p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>



Wistar    rats    receiving    a    single     injection    of      2,2'-dihydroxy-N-nitrosodipropylamine

(a tumor initiator) followed by 4,4'-methylenedianiline

(MDA) in the diet for 19 weeks, developed thyroid follicular cell carcinomas

and follicular cell and apillary adenomas.    Fischer 344/N rats and B6C3F<sub>l</sub>

mice receiving MDA as 4,4'-methylenedianiline dihydrochloride <i>ad libitum</i> in

drinking water for 2 years developed thyroid follicular cell crcinomas and

adenomas, C-cell adenomas of the thyroid, hepatocellular carcinomas and

adenomas, alveolar bronchiolar adenomas, malignant lymphomas, and benign

tumors of the adrenal gland.  Workers with airborne and dermal exposure to

powdered MDA have developed toxic hepatitis. In addition, increased

incidences of cancers of the bladder and large intestine and of

lymphosarcoma   and  reticulosarcoma    have   been   reported    in workers with

potential exposure to MDA.<p>



The observation of cancers and tumors in both rats and mice treated with MDA

meets the criteria established in the Cancer Policy of the Occupational

Safety and Health Administration for considering MDA a potential  human

carcinogen in the workplace.      Although there is limited evidence indicating

that MDA presents a carcinogenic risk to humans, the probability of

developing such effects would be decreased by reducing exposure to the

compound in the workplace.           Therefore,    the   National Institute for

Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recommends that occupational

exposures to MDA be controlled to the lowest feasible limit.



<a name="Background"></a><h2>Background</h2>



<h3>Physical and Chemical Properties</h3><p>



In pure form, 4,4'-methylenedianiline (MDA) is a light brown, crystalline

solid with a faint amine-like odor. MDA is slightly soluble in water and

readily soluble in alcohol, benzene, and ether.  It is structurally similar

to benzidine and 4,4'-methylenebis (2-chloroaniline) (MOCA or MBOCA).

Additional chemical and physical properties are listed in <a href="#table1">Table 1</a>.<p>

<h3>Production, Use, and Potential for Occupational Exposure</h3><p>



MDA is produced by the condensation of aniline with formaldehyde in the

presence of an acid catalyst [<a href="#NIOSH 1976">NIOSH 1976</a>, <a href="#NIOSH 1984b">1984b</a>]. 

In  1982,  annual production was 200-400 million pounds [<a href="#EPA 1983b">EPA 1983b</a>].

Approximately 99% of MDA

is used in the production of methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI ) or

polymeric MDI (PMDI), which are used to produce rigid or semirigid

polyurethanes.    The remaining 1% of MDA is purified and used to make

products such as protective coatings, a hardening agent for epoxy resins,

anti-corrosive materials, printed circuit parts, dyestuff

intermediates [<a href="#EPA 1983a">EPA 1983a</a>], 

filament wound

pipe [<a href="#NIOSH 1984a">NIOSH 1984a</a>], and wire

coatings [<a href="#EPA 1985">EPA 1985</a>].<p>



The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) estimates

that 9,000 U.S. workers may be exposed to MDA [<a href="#Sundin 1972-74">Sundin 1972-74</a>].<p>



<a name="Exposure Limits"></a><h2>Exposure Limits</h2>



The Occupational Safety Health Administration (OSHA) has not established

a permissible exposure  limit (PEL) for MDA.       The American Conference of

Governmental Industrial    Hygienists (ACGIH) Threshold Limit Value (TLV) for

MDA is 0.1 part of MDA per million parts of air (ppm) or 0.8 milligram of

MDA per cubic meter of     air (mg/m<sup>3</sup>) determined as an 8-hour, time-weighted

average (TWA) concentration. The ACGIH short-term exposure limit (STEL) for

MDA is 0.5 ppm (4 mg/m<sup>3</sup>). The ACGIH TLV and STEL values include a &quot;Skin&quot;

notation which refers to the potential contribution to the overall exposure

by the cutaneous route, including the mucous membranes and eyes, by either

airborne or direct contact with MDA [<a href="#ACGIH 1985">ACGIH 1985</a>]. The TLV is based on the

prevention of hepatitis in workers exposed to MDA [<a href="#ACGIH 1980">ACGIH 1980</a>].  In their

Notice of Intended Changes (for 1985-86), the ACGIH has proposed that the

STEL be deleted. Additionally, an &quot;A2&quot; designation has been proposed.  The

&quot;A2&quot; designation refers to a substance suspected of having carcinogenic

potential in man [<a href="#ACGIH 1985">ACGIH 1985</a>].  NIOSH has not established a recommended

exposure   limit  (REL) for MDA. In a recent risk assessment, the United

States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) classified MDA as a probable

human   carcinogen     [<a href="#Hirzy et al. 1985">Hirzy et al. 1985</a>] 

 and   has    referred     regulatory responsibiity for MDA to OSHA under 

Section 9(a) of the Toxic Substance Control Act [<a href="#EPA 1985">EPA 1985</a>].<p>



<a name="Toxicity"></a><h2>Toxicity</h2>



<h3>Results of Animal Studies</h3>



<b>Acute Toxicity</b><p>



The acute toxicity of MDA has been reported in several animal species by

various routes of administration.        The lethal dose of MDA for 50% of the

animals tested (LD<sub>50</sub>) was:       Oral administration to Wistar rats, 347 mg per

kilogram   of   body    weight    (mg/kg  bw)    [<a href="#Marhold    1972">Marhold    1972</a>]; 

subcutaneous

administration    to    Wistar     rats,  200 mg/kg bw     [<a href="#Steinhoff 1970">Steinhoff 1970</a>]; 

and intraperitoneal (IP) administration to BALB/cCR mice, 74 mg/kg 

bw [<a href="#Lopatka et al.  1976">Lopatka et al.  1976</a>].    The   lowest dose to 

have caused death (LDLo) by oral

administration to beagle dogs was 300 mg/kg bw

[<a href="#Deichmann et al. 1978">Deichmann et al. 1978</a>].<p>



<b>Mutagenic Effects</b>

<p>

MDA was found to be mutagenically active when   tested in Salmonella

typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100 following  metabolic activation 

[<a href="#Darby et al. 1978">Darby et al. 1978</a>; <a href="#Parodi et al. 1981">Parodi et al. 1981</a>; 

<a href="#Rao et al. 1982">Rao et al. 1982</a>], but was inactive in

strains TA1535 and TA1537, with or without metabolic activatio

 [<a href="#Darby et al. 1978">Darby et al. 1978</a>; <a href="#Rao et al. 1982">Rao et al. 1982</a>].  

 A significant increase in sister chromatid

exchanges (p<0.001) in femoral bone marrow have been reported in Swiss mice injected with MDA when compared to vehicle-treated controls [<a href="#Parodi et al. 1983">Parodi et al. 1983</a>].<p>



<b>Carcinogenic and Other Chronic Effects</b><p>



In a chronic study, capsules containing 70 mg of MDA were administered

orally   3 times   per   week   to   nine female beagle dogs over    periods of

approximately    4-7 years;    the   total  doses    of  MDA   ranged from   4.0 to

6.26 grams (g)/kg bw.     A variety of histopathologic changes were observed in

tissues from all of the dogs, particularly in the livers. However,   no

neoplastic lesions of the liver  or urinary bladder were observed.   No data

for untreated, control dogs were 

reported [<a href="#Deichmann et al. 1978">Deichmann et al. 1978</a>].<p>



Bile duct proliferation, oval cell infiltration, and fibrosis were observed

in the livers of 16 male Wistar rats fed a diet containing 1,000 ppm MDA for

32-40 weeks [<a href="#Fukushima et al. 1979">Fukushima et al. 1979</a>]. 

Bile duct proliferation and spongiosis

hepatitis were observed in the livers of 3 of 8 male Spraque-Dawley rats fed

<i>ad libitum</i> a diet containing 800 ppm MDA for 48 weeks

[<a href="#Ito et al. 1984">Ito et al. 1984</a>].  No

neoplastic lesions were observed in the MDA-treated rats in either study.

The actual dose of MDA received by the rats   in these studies was not

reported.<p>



In another study, 80-day-old male albino rats of unknown strain (120 per

group) were given 8 or 20 mg MDA/kg bw in peanut oil by gavage 5 days per

week for 16 weeks.   For control purposes, rats (120 per group) were given

peanut oil or were untreated.  Ten rats   from each group were killed and

examined at 10 days, 6 weeks, and 16 weeks for MDA-induced pathology. The

remaining rats were examined upon natural death.  The average lifespan of

all rats treated with MDA was 11.3 months, while that of the animals in   the

control groups was 12.5 months.   The average lifespan for all animals         was

short, due to pulmonary disorders and otogenic inflammation extending              into

the    meninges.     Hepatocellular      effects   including     reduced     glycogen

concentrations, and increased mitoses and numbers of multinucleated

hepatocytes were observed in rats treated with 8 mg MDA/kg bw.   In addition

to these effects, the livers of the rats treated with 20 mg MDA/kg bw had

hyperplastic nodules and &quot;adenoma-like&quot; bile duct proliferations. There was

also   evidence of  &quot;cirrhosis-like&quot;    regeneration    processes.      Statistical

analyses of these data were not reported [<a href="#Gohlke 1978">Gohlke 1978</a>].<p>



In Current Intelligence Bulletin (CIB) No. 8 published in 1976, NIOSH

summarized three studies of the carcinogenic effects of 

MDA in rats [<a href="#NIOSH 1976">NIOSH 1976</a>].   In one study MDA was administered subcutaneously to 50 Wistar rats

(25 of each sex).     A two-fold increase of malignant and benign tumors (types

unspecified) was observed in the MDA-treated rats when compared with

controls treated with saline.       Hepatomas have been observed in two studies

following MDA administration to rats by gavage:        Single occurrences of other

tumors, including an adenocarcinoma of the uterus, were also reported.               No

conclusions could be drawn from these studies regarding the carcinogenicity

of MDA due to their short duration, limited numbers of animals studied, and

lack of control animals or historical control data.<p>



In 1976, a 2-year study of the carcinogenic effects of chronic ingestion of

MDA in drinking water was performed for the National Toxicology Program

(NTP) [<a href="#Weisburger et al. 1981">Weisburger et al. 1981</a>; <a href="#NTP 1983">NTP 1983</a>].   

Drinking water containing either 150 or 300 ppm MDA (as the dihydrochloride salt, &gt;98% pure) 

was administered

ad libitum to groups of Fischer 344/N rats and B6C3Fl mice (50 of each

sex) for 103 weeks.   Control animals (50 rats and 50 mice of each sex)

received drinking water adjusted to the pH of the 300 ppm dose.   Based on

the water consumed by the animals, the average daily intake of MDA by the

animals expressed  in mg/kg bw (+ one standard deviation) is provided in

In 1984, the results were reported of a study designed to test the cancer

promotion potential of MDA following administration of 

2,2'-dihydroxy-N-nitrosodipropylamine (DHPN), the initiator, using male Wistar rats

[<a href="#Hiasa et al. 1984">Hiasa et al. 1984</a>].    

The rats were placed into four groups of 21 each. Group 1

received a single IP injection of 2.8 g dhpn/kg bw followed for 19 weeks

with 1,000 ppm MDA in the diet; Group 2 received 2.8 g DHPN/kg bw IP;

Group 3, 1,000 ppm MDA in the diet; and Group 4 (controls), 5 milli liters

(mL) of saline/kg bw IP.  All the rats were killed after 19 weeks.         Thyroid

follicular cell carcinomas developed in 9.5% of the DHPN and MDA-treated

rats (Group 1).    Thyroid follicular cell and papillary adenomas    adenomas developed in

90% of the DHPN and MDA-treated rats (Group 1) and in 28% of the DHPN-

treated  rats   (Group 2);    these    incidences    were    significantly      different

(p<0.05) between Groups 1 and 2. No tumors were reported in Groups 3 or 4. A carcinogenic response was not observed when the initiator or promoter were administered separately (Groups 2 and 3), but was observed when the initiator and promoter were administered sequentially (Group 1). Although the study was of short duration, the authors concluded that DHPN was the initiator and that MDA was the promoter [<a href="#Hiasa et al. 1984">Hiasa et al. 1984</a>], a postulate

substantiated by other studies involving the activity of DHPN as an

initiator [<a href="#Hiasa et al. 1982a">Hiasa et al. 1982a</a>; <a href="#Hiasa et al. 1982b">1982b</a>].<p>



<h3>Human Health Effects</h3>



In 1976, NIOSH reviewed several studies of the health effects of MDA in

workers which described the occurrence of jaundice, bile duct inflammation,

suppression of bile excretion, and clinical hepatitis [<a href="#NIOSH 1976">NIOSH 1976</a>].

In other case studies, it was reported that dermal exposure to MDA resulted in

allergic contact dermatitis [<a href="#Emmett 1976">Emmett 1976</a>],

acute myocardial damage [<a href="#Brooks et al. 1979">Brooks et al. 1979</a>],

jaundice [<a href="#Dunn and Guirguis 1979">Dunn and Guirguis 1979</a>], photosensitivity

[<a href="#LeVine 1983">LeVine 1983</a>], hepatitis [<a href="#Bastian 1984">Bastian 1984</a>],

and yellow staining of the skin [<a href="#Cohen 1985">Cohen 1985</a>].  

Hepatitis and impaired visual acuity have been observed following

ingestion of MDA [<a href="#Roy et al. 1985">Roy et al. 1985</a>].   

No information is available on the rate of absorption or metabolism of MDA in humans.<p>



In 1982, NIOSH published the results of a Health Hazard Evaluation (HHE)

[<a href="#NIOSH 1982">NIOSH 1982</a>] of workers in the blade and

pattern shops of a manufacturer of helicopters  and helicopter parts.       

The purpose of the evaluation was to

determine if workers in those shops       were at an increased risk of cancer of

the bladder and colon. A proportionate mortality ratio (PMR) study was

designed to  analyze the mortality  pattern observed in the deaths of 179

white male   workers.     These deaths were       identified from among &quot;exposed&quot;

workers who:   Had been employed by       the company 10 years or longer and had

been assigned at least one month in the area where there was potential

exposure to    epoxy     resins    and    curing    agents,     including    MDA.       The

concentrations of MDA in the air  for three personal samples were:           Below

10 micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m<sup>3</sup>) for a 20, liter (L) sample (the limit

of  detection),     0.23 mg/m<sup>3</sup>,     and    0.46 mg/m<sup>3</sup>. 

Causes     of   death      for &quot;exposed&quot; workers were examined and statistically significant excesses of

cancer of the bladder  (3 observed vs. 0.8 expected,  PMR 3.74, p<u>&lt;</u>0.05),

cancer of the    large    intestine (7 observed vs. 3.1 expected,     PMR 2.26,

p<u>&lt;</u>0.05), and lymphosarcoma/reticulosarcoma (3 observed vs. 0.87 expected,

PMR 3.45, p<u>&lt;</u>0.05) were detected.       In the proportional cancer mortality ratio

(PCMR) analysis, only cancer of the bladder remained statistically

significant (PCMR 3.41, p<u>&lt;</u>0.05).  In addition, two more cases of bladder

cancer were found in &quot;exposed&quot; living workers [<a href="#NIOSH 1982">NIOSH 1982</a>].<p>



In this study [<a href="#NIOSH 1982">NIOSH 1982</a>], there wore a number of limitations such as:

(1) The concentrations of MDA were determined by using a sampling method

which has been shown to be unreliable [<a href="#Boeniger 1985">Boeniger 1985</a>], and

may underestimate historical exposure; (2) the workers in the areas were also potentially

exposed to a       number of     other    chemicals    such   as    ethylenediamine,

cyclohexanone, methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK), toluene, and butyl glycidyl

ether (BGE); (3) the PMR study design is subject to potential biases because

it only includes workers with 10 years or more work experience and lacks

information on death cause categories; and (4) the duration of exposure and

latency   for  the  bladder  cancer   cases   are   shorter   than   that   usually

associated with    solid   tumors   resulting    from  occupational    or    chemical

exposures.   However, the study provides support for suspected increased risk

of cancer of the bladder and colon associated with exposure to MDA. The

study also suggests that an increased risk of lymphosarcoma/reticulosarcoma

may be associated with exposure to MDA.<p>



<a name="Conclusions"></a><h2>Conclusions</h2>



This bulletin has focused on studies regarding the carcinogenic potential of

MDA that have been reported since NIOSH CIB No. 8 was published in 1976.

That CIB warned of acute liver toxicity in animals and humans.<p>



More recent animal studies indicate a potential for carcinogenicity from

exposure to MDA.  The liver, thyroid, adrenal glands, and lymphatic system

are the primary sites identified with carcinogenic or tumorigenic responses

following oral or IP administration of MDA.   The occurrence of uncommon

tumors of the bile duct and urinary bladder may also be significant due to

their  low historical control incidences.    In rats, MDA also acted as a

promoter of tumor development.<p>



Epidemiologic evidence suggests an association between MDA and bladder

cancer, colon cancer,  lymphosarcoma, and reticulosarcoma in workers with

exposure to MDA and other chemical agents.  Although airborne exposures to

MDA may occur, dermal contact is considered the major route of occupational

exposure.<p>



NIOSH believes that the collective toxicologic data on carcinogenicity

provide sufficient evidence to warrant concern for occupational exposure to

MDA.  Although there is limited evidence indicating that MDA presents a

carcinogenic risk to exposed workers, the human data, in view of the

positive data in other mammalian species, suggest that such a potential may

exist.<p>



<a name="Recommendations"></a><h2>Recommendations</h2>



There are several classifications for identifying a substance as a

carcinogen.   Such classifications have been developed by NTP [<a href="#NTP 1984">NTP 1984</a>], the

International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) [<a href="#WHO 1979">WHO 1979</a>], and OSHA in

its   &quot;Identification,     Classification,    and   Regulation    of     Potential

Occupational Carcinogens&quot; 29 CFR 1990 [<a href="#OSHA 1984b">OSHA 1984b</a>], also known as &quot;The OSHA

Cancer  Policy.&quot;    NIOSH   considers    the  OSHA   classification   the    most

appropriate for use in identifying occupational carcinogens<a name="note1a"></a><sup><a href="#note1">*</a></sup> 

[<a href="#OSHA 1984b">OSHA 1984b</a>].

Since exposure to MDA has been shown to produce malignant tumors in rats and

mice, it meets the OSHA criteria.     Therefore, NIOSH recommends that MDA be

considered a potential human carcinogen in the workplace.<p>



The excess risk of cancer to workers exposed to MDA has not yet been

determined, but the probability of developing cancer would be decreased by

minimizing exposure.     As prudent public health policy, employers should

assess the conditions under which workers may be exposed to MDA and take

reasonable precautions to reduce exposures to the lowest feasible limit.<p>



The guidelines for minimizing worker exposure to MDA, presented in the

<a href="#Appendix">Appendix</a>, are general    in nature and should be adapted to specific work

situations as required.<p>

Guidelines for Minimizing Worker Exposure to 4,4'-Methylenedianiline (MDA)</h2></center>



It is recommended that MDA be regarded as a potential human carcinogen in

the workplace.   This recommendation is based on the ability of MDA to induce

cancer in experimental animals and on limited evidence of its carcinogenic

risk to humans.      Consequently, appropriate engineering and work practice

controls should be used to reduce worker exposure to the lowest feasible

limit.  The guidelines and recommendations that follow are general in nature

and should be adapted to specific situations as required.   These first three

primary    recommendations     (product     substitution,     closed    systems     and

ventilation, and worker isolation)   provide protection for the worker from

both dermal and inhalation exposure.<p>



<a name="Exposure Monitoring"></a><h2>Exposure Monitoring</h2>



NIOSH recommends that each employer who manufactures, transports, packages,

stores, or uses MDA in any capacity determine if a potential exists for any

worker to be exposed to the chemical.<p>



In work areas where exposures may occur, an initial survey should be done to

determine the extent of any worker's exposure.            In general, daily worker

time-weighted average       exposures    should   be    determined    by    collecting

full-shift samples.    When the potential for exposure is periodic, short-term

samples may be needed in place of or as part of full-shift sampling.

Personal sampling is preferred over area sampling.          If personal sampling is

not feasible, area sampling can be substituted only if the results can be

used to approximate the workers' exposure. Source and general area samples

may also be useful in identifying the source of emissions so that effective

engineering or work practice controls can be instituted. NIOSH is currently

developing a sampling method for MDA [<a href="#Geraci 1986">Geraci 1986</a>].   

 In the past, a number of different methods have been used

 [<a href="#NIOSH 1984a">NIOSH 1984a</a>, <a href="#NIOSH 1984d">1984d</a>].   

The sampling

procedure must include provisions for obtaining sufficient sample volumes to

ensure that the presence of small concentrations of MDA are not overlooked.<p>



If the initial survey indicates that no worker is exposed to MDA, no further

sampling is recommended unless changes in production, process, controls,

work practices, or weather conditions occur        that may result in a change in

exposure conditions.    When workers are found to be working in environments

containing measurable concentrations of MDA, periodic sampling at intervals

not greater than 6 months is recommended.      Periodic sampling should be

continued until    no measurable concentrations of MDA are noted               in two

consecutive surveys.     Periodic sampling should always be conducted in the

work area of workers who are wearing respirators for protection against MDA.<p>



The NIOSH <i>Occupational Exposure Sampling Strategy Manual</i> may be helpful in

developing efficient strategies to. monitor worker exposure to MDA.   The

manual contains information regarding determination of the need for exposure

monitoring, the number of samples to be collected, and the selection of

appropriate sampling times [<a href="#Leidel et al. 1977">Leidel et al. 1977</a>].<p>



In a facility  in France, workers were monitored   for MDA exposure by

measurement of MDA's metabolites  in their

urine [<a href="#Vaudine et al. 1982">Vaudine et al. 1982</a>].

NIOSH has developed a protocol for determining MDA  and MDA metabolites in

the urine of workers [<a href="#Boeniger 1984">Boeniger 1984</a>].<p>



<a name="Controlling Worker Exposure"></a><h2>Controlling Worker Exposure</h2>



Proper maintenance of equipment and worker education are vital aspects of a

good control program.     Workers should be informed of any materials that may

contain or be contaminated with MDA, the nature of the potential hazard, and

of methods for minimizing exposure.          Every attempt    should be made       to

minimize exposure to MDA by implementing the following practices and

controls:<p>



<h3>Product Substitution</h3>



When   feasible,   substitution of an alternative material          with a     lesser

potential   health   risk  is often   the best and most effective method for

reducing or eliminating exposure.      However, extreme care must be used when

selecting substitutes.      Possible  adverse health effects from exposure to

alternatives for MDA should be evaluated prior to selection.<p>



<h3>Closed Systems and Ventilation</h3>



Engineering controls should be the principal method for minimizing the

potential  for MDA exposure in the workplace.         Achieving and maintaining

reduced concentrations of airborne MDA in the workplace depend upon the

incorporation of adequate engineering control measures, such as properly

constructed and maintained closed-system operations and ventilation.<p>



Closed-system operations provide the most effective means for minimizing

worker exposures to MDA.        Closed systems should be used for producing,

storing, transferring, packaging, and processing MDA.        Where closed systems

cannot be employed or do not operate effectively, local exhaust ventilation

should be provided to direct particulate or vapors away from 

workers [<a href="#NIOSH 1984d">NIOSH 1984d</a>]. 

This contaminated exhaust air should not be 

recirculated [<a href="#NIOSH 1984c">NIOSH 1984c</a>].   Exhaust-ventilation

systems for quality control  laboratories or

laboratories where samples are prepared for analyses, should be designed to

adequately capture and contain MDA particulate or vapors.   Guidance for

designing local exhaust-ventilation systems can be found in <i>Recommended

Industrial Ventilation Guidelines</i> [<a href="#Hagopian and Bastress 1976">Hagopian and Bastress 1976</a>],   

<i>Industrial Ventilation--A Manual of Recommended

Practice</i> [<a href="#ACGIH 1984">ACGIH 1984</a>] and <i>Fundamentals

Governing the Design and Operation of Local Exhaust Systems</i>, ANSI Z9.2-1979

[<a href="#ANSI 1979">ANSI 1979</a>].<p>



Ventilation equipment should be checked at least every 3 months to ensure

adequate performance.  System effectiveness should also be checked when

there are any changes in production, process, or control that might result

in significant increases in airborne exposure to MDA.<p>



<h3>Worker Isolation</h3>



The areas in which MDA is produced or used should be restricted to only

those workers who are essential to the process or operation.   If feasible,

these    workers     should     be   isolated     from    direct   contact     with    the work

environment by the use of automated equipment operated from a closed   control

booth or room.       The control booth or room should be maintained at a greater

air pressure than that surrounding the process equipment so that air flows

out of, rather than into, the room.   This type of control will not  protect

workers who must enter the general work area to perform process    checks,

adjustments,      maintenance,      assembly-line       tasks,     and    related operations.

Therefore, special        precautions are often necessary               to prevent or         limit

worker exposure        in  these situations and frequently  involve    the use of

personal protective equipment.<p>



<h3>Personal Protective Clothing</h3>



All workers who may be exposed to MDA should be equipped with chemical

protective clothing to ensure their protection.  In the selection of

protective clothing, consideration should be given to the utilization of

disposable apparel because of the uncertainty of decontamination of reusable

clothing.<p>



Outer protective clothing  should consist of fully encapsulating protective

clothing.     Gloves should  be made of polyvinyl chloride or naturallatex

which have been shown to be resistant to permeation by MDA dissolved in

methanol [<a href="#Weeks and Dean 1977">Weeks and Dean 1977</a>].  

For personal comfort, workers may wear

inner garments consisting of cotton coveralls,  undershirts, undershorts,

gloves, and socks.  Special consideration should be given to disposal of

inner garments after use because small   amounts of contaminants may be

transferred to the inner garments when removing outer protective clothing

[<a href="#Schwope et al. 1985">Schwope et al. 1985</a>].  The effectiveness 

of the protective clothing should

be evaluated under simulated use conditions,  regardless of the type of

clothing used.      Workers should be informed of the potential for heat stress

that may occur when working in an encapsulated suit.  Areas of the body

which come in contact with MDA should be thoroughly washed with soap and

water immediately.        As a general hygienic measure, facilities (e.g., change

rooms, lockers, shower, etc.) for personal cleanliness should be provided.<p>



<h3>Respiratory Protection</h3>



The use of  respiratory protection   requires  that a respiratory protection

program    be    instituted     which,    at   a minimum,       meets    the   requirements of

29 CFR 1910.134 [<a href="#OSHA 1984a">OSHA 1984a</a>].   In addition to

selection of  respirators

approved by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) and NIOSH, a

complete    respiratory protection program should  include at  least  regular

training of personnel, fit testing, periodic environmental monitoring,

maintenance, inspection, and cleaning of equipment. The program should be

evaluated regularly.<p>



It must be stressed that the use of respiratory protection is the  least

preferred method of controlling worker exposures and should not be used as

the only means of        preventing     or  minimizing     exposure  during     routine

operations.    However, NIOSH recognizes that respirators may be required to

provide protection under certain situations   (such   as   implementation     of

engineering    controls,    certain short-duration maintenance procedures,    and

emergencies).     NIOSH maintains that only the most protective  respirators

should be used to protect workers from exposure to workplace carcinogens.

Such respirators include:

<p>

<ul><li>A self-contained breathing apparatus with a full facepiece operated in

pressure-demand or other positive-pressure mode<p>



     <li>A  supplied-air     respirator    with    a full facepiece operated in

pressure-demand or other positive-pressure mode, in combination with

an auxiliary self-contained breathing apparatus operated in 

pressure-demand or other positive-pressure mode

</li></ul><p>



<h3>Decontamination Procedures</h3>



Decontamination of MDA-contaminated work surfaces may be accomplished by

initial dry vacuuming of both horizontal and vertical surfaces with a vacuum

cleaning system equipped with a high-efficiency particulate (HEPA) filter.

Most of the remaining MDA should be transformed to a water-soluble salt by

applying a hydrochloric acid/methanol solution, and should be removed by

absorption with a sponge.        Any residual MDA should be transformed to its

corresponding &quot;Schiff&quot; base with p-dimethylaminobenzaldeyde and    removed

with a methanol-moistened sponge [<a href="#Weeks and Dean 1978">Weeks and Dean 1978</a>].  The surface should

be thoroughly cleaned with a detergent solution and rinsed with water.    All

contaminated protective clothing or equipment should be removed and

discarded, or if cleaned,  analyzed for residual contamination before reuse

or storage.     Contaminated waste should be collected and placed in sealed

containers for disposal in accordance with existing regulations of the U.S.

Environmental Protection   Agency, and the Department of Transportation.

State and local regulations may supersede federal regulations, if  they are

more restrictive.<p>



<a name="Medical Surveillance"></a><h2>Medical Surveillance</h2>



A medical    surveillance program should be established to prevent (or to

attempt to detect at an early stage) both the acute and chronic adverse

health effects in workers resulting from exposure to MDA. Medical and work

histories including previous exposure to MDA or other toxic agents should be

taken for each worker prior to job placement and updated periodically.  The

physician responsible should be provided with information concerning the

adverse health effects of MDA exposure and an estimate of the worker's

potential for exposure to MDA, including any available workplace sampling

results and a description of any protective devices or equipment the worker

may be required to use.       A smoking cessation program should be provided,

because cigarette smoking is a well-established risk factor for bladder

cancer [<a href="#Matanoski and Elliot 1981">Matanoski and Elliot 1981</a>].<p>



The examining physician should direct particular attention to the skin,

liver,  urinary,    respiratory,    and   gastrointestinal     tracts,    and   to    the

endocrine system, as these are most   likely to be affected by MDA.   A

baseline health status can       be established as a result of this, program.

Deviations from the baseline    health status should permit early detection of

adverse health effects and should prompt medical personnel to consider

additional   specific   tests   for   the  

individual    [<a href="#Dunn and Guirguis 1979">Dunn and Guirguis 1979</a>;

<a href="#Schulte et al. 1986">Schulte et al. 1986</a>]. 

Complete medical evaluations of each worker should

also be performed upon       job   transfer or termination. The occurrence of

disease or other work-related adverse health effects necessitates immediate

evaluation   of   primary   preventative     measures (e.g.,     industrial     hygiene

monitoring, engineering controls, and personal protective equipment).

Medical personnel should ensure that workers and employers be informed about

work-related hazards associated with exposure to MDA.<p>
