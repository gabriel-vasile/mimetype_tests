SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The FAA has completed and is making publicly 
available its Record of Decision for the proposed replacement airport 
at St. George, Utah. The FAA has published a Notice of Availability of 
the FEIS in the Federal Register on May 12, 2006. The FAA prepared the 
FEIS pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. The 
FEIS assesses the potential impact of the proposed replacement airport, 
as well as the ``No Action Alternative'' of not constructing a new 
airport. The FAA accepted comments on the FEIS and prepared responses 
to the comments, both of which are included in an appendix to the ROD.

alternative in meeting the purpose and need for improvements for St. 
George. The proposed replacement airport alternative includes the 
following federal actions: Construction and operation of a new 9,300-
foot runway (01/19), and all support facilities (i.e., taxiways and 
associated lighting; a passenger terminal, apron, and associated 
parking; an aircraft rescue and fire-fighting (ARFF) facility; 
facilities for a fixed-base operator, general and corporate aviation, 
and air cargo; fuel farm facilities; airport maintenance facilities; 
and airport access to the Southern Corridor Highway). Also included in
