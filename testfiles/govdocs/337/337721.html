<p><span class=Heading3>Issued by</span><br>
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)  (<a href="http://www.niaid.nih.gov/">http://www.niaid.nih.gov</a>)</p>
  

  
<p class="Heading3">Purpose</p>
<p>NIAID is  seeking input from the scientific community, health professionals, patient  advocates, and the general public about current and emerging priorities in  basic vaccine discovery research that could provide clues about how to make an  HIV vaccine that establishes and maintains a state of resistance to HIV  infection and/or disease.  Opinions from  junior investigators and new faculty are particularly encouraged.</p>
<p>Please be  advised that NIAID has published an RFI concurrent to this one for input on  novel approaches to interrupt HIV transmission.   [<a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-AI-08-049.html">NOT-AI-08-049</a>]  Interested individuals are invited to respond  to both RFIs. </p>
<p class="Heading3">Background </p>
<p>The  mission of the Division of AIDS (DAIDS) at NIAID is to pursue an end to the  HIV/AIDS epidemic by (1) increasing basic knowledge of the pathogenesis and  transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), (2) supporting the  development of therapies for HIV infection and its complications and  co-infections, and (3) facilitating the development of vaccines and safe,  effective prevention strategies.  DAIDS  accomplishes its mission through planning, implementing, managing, and  evaluating research programs and portfolios that address these goals. </p>
<p>In an  effort to stimulate scientific discussion and debate among HIV investigators  participating in each of these research areas, and focusing on prevention  efforts carried out through HIV vaccine trials, the National Institute of  Allergy and Infectious Diseases held a summit on March 25, 2008.  The summit consisted of three interactive  panel discussions focused on the following themes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The  optimal balance between vaccine discovery research and development studies  designed to advance promising vaccine candidates into clinical trials</li>
  <li>Optimization  and utilization of non-human primate models to support vaccine research</li>
  <li>Integration  of clinical research with vaccine discovery efforts</li>
</ul>
<p>The  webcast of the full summit is available at: <a href="http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/news/events/summitHIVVaccine.htm">http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/news/events/summitHIVVaccine.htm</a>.  </p>
<p><span class="Heading3">Information Requested</span> <br>
    <br>
Through this RFI, NIAID is following up on the vaccine summit by inviting the  scientific community, health professionals, patient advocates, and the general  public to respond to the following questions. The overall goal is to define  research that will address the major scientific obstacles to more complete  knowledge of HIV and contribute to the design of a safe and effective  preventive vaccine.</p>
<p>1. In  which areas of basic vaccine discovery research should resources and emphasis  be focused to solve the key scientific obstacles in HIV vaccine research?<br>
  2. Which  of these areas are best addressed through individual research projects and  which through multi-disciplinary research teams?<br>
  3. How can  multidisciplinary research best be fostered to enhance the chance of successful  outcomes? <br>
  4. How can  new investigators and new ideas from within and outside the HIV vaccine field  best be attracted into these areas of research?  </p>
<p class="Heading3">Responses </p>
<p>Responses  will be accepted through May 20, 2008 and may be sent to the following email  address: (<a href="mailto:BasicVaccDiscoveryRFI@niaid.nih.gov">BasicVaccDiscoveryRFI@niaid.nih.gov</a>) <br>
    <br>
    <strong>You are asked to limit your total  response to a maximum of 5 pages.</strong></p>
<p>The information obtained from responses to this RFI will aid DAIDS, NIAID, in developing one or more future Funding  Opportunity Announcements (FOA) for appropriate types of applications that  address research areas identified through this inquiry.</p>
<p>This RFI  shall not be construed as a solicitation for applications or as an obligation  on the part of the government.  The  government will not pay for the preparation of any information submitted.  Responders should be aware that the  information provided will be analyzed and may be used to develop future funding  opportunity announcements and/or appear in various reports.  The  government cannot guarantee the confidentiality of the information provided.</p>
