<p>This is a  time-sensitive Request for Information (RFI) soliciting input that will assist  a working group of the National Advisory General Medical Sciences Council as it  carries out an assessment of the NIGMS Protein Structure Initiative (PSI). <br>
  <br>
This RFI is for  planning purposes only and should not be construed as a solicitation for  applications or an obligation of the part of the government. The government  will not pay for the preparation of any information submitted or for the  government's use of that information. <br>
<br>
<strong>Background</strong>: The mission of the National Institute of  General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) includes the support of basic biomedical  research in fields such as cell biology, biophysics, genetics, developmental  biology, pharmacology, physiology, biochemistry, chemistry, bioinformatics,  computational biology, and certain clinical areas.&nbsp; In supporting basic research the NIGMS employs  various grant mechanisms that provide funding for both individual  investigator-oriented projects as well as larger collaborative projects  involving multiple investigators.&nbsp; More  information is available via the NIGMS homepage, noted above.<br>
<br>
The Protein  Structure Initiative (PSI) is a large collaborative research effort that the NIGMS has supported for  nearly seven years.&nbsp; The PSI, which is  implemented through an integrated group of research centers and smaller  projects, is experimentally determining the three- dimensional structure of  proteins in pursuit of its overall goal of making the three-dimensional atomic-level  structures of most proteins easily obtainable from knowledge of their  corresponding DNA sequences. &nbsp;The specific goals of PSI-1  (2000-2005) were: 1) to develop methodology and technology to increase success  rates and lower costs of structural determination; 2) to construct and automate  the protein production and structural determination pipeline; and 3) to  determine unique protein structures.&nbsp; The  specific goals of PSI-2 (2005-2010) are: 1) to increase the number of sequence  families with structural representatives, including families with high  biological impact; 2) to continue methodology and technology development,  especially for challenging classes of proteins such as membrane proteins; and  3) to facilitate the use of structures by the broad scientific community.&nbsp; More detailed information on the goals,  contributions and organization of this large project is available at <a href="http://www.nigms.nih.gov/News/Reports/psi2_update_052007.htm" title="http://www.nigms.nih.gov/News/Reports/psi2_update_052007.htm">http://www.nigms.nih.gov/News/Reports/psi2_update_052007.htm</a>. <br>
<br>
<strong>Responses Sought:</strong>&nbsp; The  NIGMS Advisory Council and Institute leadership have requested that an  assessment of the PSI be undertaken.&nbsp;  This assessment (<a href="http://www.nigms.nih.gov/About/Council/PSIAssessment/" title="http://www.nigms.nih.gov/About/Council/PSIAssessment/">http://www.nigms.nih.gov/About/Council/PSIAssessment/</a>) will be carried out by a panel of investigators  that will meet in the fall of 2007 to consider the status of the project and  its impact on the biomedical research enterprise.&nbsp; NIGMS is inviting scientists, scientific  organizations, and other interested parties to participate in this assessment  by responding to these questions.</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
 <li> How do structural biology in general and the  PSI in particular impact your research?&nbsp;<br> 
   <br>
  <li>How have PSI results       been useful to you or your colleagues?&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Do you believe there have been positive and/or negative consequences       of the PSI?&nbsp; If so, please describe       them.&nbsp; </li>
</ol>
<ol start="4" type="1">
  <li>What is your opinion of the overall goal for the PSI, i.e., making the       three-dimensional atomic-level structures of most proteins easily       obtainable from knowledge of their corresponding DNA sequences?&nbsp; Please provide your reasoning. </li>
</ol>
<ol start="5" type="1">
  <li>How likely do you       think it is that the PSI will meet its overall goal? &nbsp;Please provide your       reasoning.&nbsp; </li>
</ol>
<ol start="6" type="1">
  <li>What is your opinion of the merits, relative to one another, of the       specific goals of PSI-1, which were 1) to develop methodology and technology to       increase success rates and lower costs of structural determination, 2) to       construct and automate the protein production and structural determination       pipeline, and 3) to determine unique protein structures? </li>
</ol>
<ol start="7" type="1">
  <li>What is your opinion of the merits, relative to each other, of the specific       goals of PSI-2, which are 1) to increase the number of sequence families with structural       representatives, including families with high biological impact; 2) to       continue methodology and technology development, especially for       challenging classes of proteins such as membrane proteins; and 3) to       facilitate the use of structures by the broad scientific community? </li>
</ol>
<ol start="8" type="1">
  <li>In terms of impact, how do the contributions of PSI-1 and PSI-2       compare to those of structural biology pursued outside the PSI?</li>
</ol>
<ol start="9" type="1">
  <li>How are PSI results       being integrated into the research of the broader biomedical community? </li>
</ol>
<ol start="10" type="1">
  <li>Are there unmet needs that the PSI could address following its       current production phase?&nbsp; If so,       please describe them.&nbsp; </li>
</ol>
<ol start="11" type="1">
  <li>Do you have further comments about the PSI?</li>
</ol>
