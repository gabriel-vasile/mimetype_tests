                DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR
                DONATION ACTIVITY GUIDELINES
</pre>

<p>These guidelines address what is appropriate activity
regarding the solicitation and acceptance of donations by
employees of those agencies within the Department of the Interior
which have gift acceptance authority. It builds in part on the
legal advice contained in the Solicitor's memorandum dated July
19, 1995, on National Park Service fundraising.</p>

<p>Congress has authorized some of the Department's constituent
agencies - - such as the National Park Service (NPS), the Fish
and Wildlife Service (FWS), the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA)
and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) - - to accept donations,
either to further the mission of the agency generally or for more
limited purposes. Congress has not expressly provided these
agencies with the authority to solicit gifts. Absent such
additional authority, the agencies' role with respect to
donations is generally restricted to educating the public about
the existence of the gift acceptance authority and the specific
gift needs of the bureau</p>

<p>To assist the NPS and FWS in their missions, Congress has
chartered the National Park Foundation (NPF) and the National
Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF) and authorized these
Foundations not only to accept, but also to solicit, donations.</p>

<p>While Departmental agencies do not have separate authority to
solicit donations, they are authorized to help facilitate the
activities of the Foundations. For this reason, the Solicitor has
concluded that Departmental employees may, as part of their
official duties, facilitate in a limited way the solicitation of
donations to the Foundations.</p>

<p>The purpose of these guidelines is to describe what are
appropriate activities of Departmental agencies and employees:
(a) in support of the fundraising efforts for the benefit of the
NPF and NFWF (&quot;cooperative Foundation programs&quot;); and
(b) in connection with donations from non-federal sources
directly to Departmental agencies authorized to receive donations
(&quot;direct donations&quot;). These guidelines are framed
within applicable statutory, ethical and conduct limitations.</p>

<p>For purposes of these guidelines, &quot;solicit&quot; or
&quot;solicitation&quot; means any action that the party
approached may construe as a serious request for money or in-kind
services or goods.</p>

<p><u>A. General Guidelines Applicable To All Donation Activities</u></p>

<p>1. Neither Departmental agencies, nor employees on behalf of
their agencies, may accept donatons directly from prohibited
sources described in Part D below.</p>

<p>2. Neither Departmental agencies, nor employees on behalf of
their agencies, may solicit donations from any source, except as
part of an approved cooperative Foundation program and otherwise
consistent with these guidelines.</p>

<p>3. Donation activities of Departmental employees must</p>

<p>(a) be incidental to the carrying out of official duties;</p>

<p>(b) involve only a minimal expenditure of Departmental funds
(even funds donated to the Department); and</p>

<p>(c) Not involve travel away from the post solely for the
donation solicitation effort of the cooperative Foundation
program.</p>

<p><u>B. Cooperative Foundation Programs</u></p>

<p>1. Departmental agencies and employees may engage in donation
solicitation activities only as part of a cooperative Foundation
program. The Secretary, Chief of Staff, an Assistant Secretary or
the appropriate agency director may commit to a cooperative
Foundation program. In order to proceed with the program, the
Foundation and the Department must have a written agreement that
conforms to these Guidelines.</p>

<p>2. Departmental employees may not facilitate donations in the
name of a Foundation except in accordance with the terms of the
cooperative Foundation program.</p>

<p>3. Foundation solicitation activities that involve
Departmental employees must make clear to those solicited that
Departmental employees are assisting in the soliciting of money,
in-kind services or property in conjunction with an approved
program with the (named) Foundation.</p>

<p><u>C. Direct Donations</u></p>

<p>1. Apart from approved cooperative Foundation programs,
Departmental employees should not actively approach persons or
entities requesting donations. Employees of Departmental agencies
authorized to accept donations may inform the public that the
agency may accept donations for its programs. As part of this
informational activity, the agency may develop &quot;wish
lists&quot; of particular programs or activities that it could
undertake with donated funds, and an employee may mention such a
&quot;wish list&quot; in a speech or article and state that the
agency may accept donations for these purposes.</p>

<p>2. These guidelines are not intended to foreclose donation
agreements between the agencies and nonfederal entities
addressing the procedures by which donations will be accepted and
administered. For example, the NPS had an agreement with the
Coleman Co. pursuant to which , for a period of time, Coleman
donated money to the NPS each time a particular item was sold by
Coleman. Another NPS agreement with the National Education
Association set guidelines for the Association's fundraising
campaign to fund an exhibit within the Lincoln Memorial. These
arrangements continue to be proper under these guidelines.</p>

<p>3. These guidelines are not intended to preclude outreach and
partnership agreements between agencies and cooperating
associations or organizations that conduct programs on agency
property and further the programs and activities of the agency.
For example, NPS has several agreements with nonprofit
cooperating associations authorizing the associations to sell
books and other educational materials inside sales rooms assigned
to associations within park buildings. NPS may accept periodic
donations from the cooperating associations.</p>

<p>4. Nothing in these guidelines is intended to prohibit the
Department or its employees from applying for competitive grants,
except that no such grant application should be made to a
prohibitied source described below.</p>

<p><u>D. Prohibited Sources</u></p>

<p>1. Departmental agencies, or employees on behalf of their
agencies, should not accept (or solicit or accept under a
cooperative Foundation program) donations from persons and
entities who:</p>

<p>(a) Have litigation pending with, or have or are seeking to
obtain a contract, lease, grant or other business, benefit or
assistance from the agency that would receive the donation.</p>

<p>. (b) Conduct operations or activities that are regulated by
the agency that would receive the donation.</p>

<p>(c) Appear to be offering a gift with the expectation of
obtaining advantage or preference in dealing with the Department
or any of its agencies.</p>

<p>2. Other entities, such as the NPF or NFWF, may solicit and
accept donations from such prohibited sources, even if some or
all of the donation is eventually donated to the agency, so long
as no Departmental employee is involved in the solicitation or
acceptance of the donation to the other entity, and it does not
come directly to the agency.</p>

<p>3. Departmental agencies and employees should exercise caution
regarding the acceptance (or solicitation or acceptance under a
cooperative Foundation program) of donations from a person or
entity where the acceptance or solicitation could reflect
adversely on the Department or any of its agencies.</p>

<p>4. Examples:</p>

<p>(a) XYZ Company is a party in a lawsuit against NPS involving
National Park A. XYZ offers to contribute $2 million to a trail
restoration project being carried out by the NPS in National Park
B. The NPS may not accept the donation. XYZ may, however, make a
donation to the National Park Foundation which in turn may make
some or all of that donation available to the NPS, but no
Departmental employee may be involved in solicitation or
acceptance of the donation by the Foundation.</p>

<p>(b) MNO Company is a concessioner in a national park with the
right to serve food to park visitors. MNO Company volunteers on
infrequent occasions to provide refreshments at park-sponsored
events to support park activities. MNO's assistance should be
considered co-sponsorship rather than a donation to the National
Park Service.</p>

<p>(c) DEF Company, a concessioner in the National Park System,
offers to donate funds to a wildlife research project conducted
by the Fish &amp; Wildlife Service. The FWS may accept (and under
a cooperative Foundation program, may assist in the Foundation's
solicitation and acceptance of) donations from DEF for this
purpose.</p>

<p>(d) ABC Company holds mineral leases from the Department of
the Interior. Its operations are regulated and monitored by BLM.
None of ABC Company's operations involve NPS lands or programs.
The NPS may accept (and under a cooperative Foundation program,
may assist in the Foundation's solicitation and acceptance of)
donations for NPS programs and activities.</p>

<p>(e) JKL Construction has submitted a bid to the BIA to
construct a school on an Indian reservation. While this matter is
pending, BIA may not accept (or under a cooperative Foundation
program, assist in the Foundation's solicitation and acceptance
of) donations from JKL Construction.</p>

<p>(f) PQR Tobacco Company has offered to make a donation to FWS.
FWS may choose not to accept this donation because it may reflect
adversely on the Department.</p>

<p>(g) STU Company is in settlement discussions with the FWS over
litigation involving natural resources damages of tens of
millions of dollars arising out of an oil spill. STU Company
offers the National Park Service a large donation. NPS may choose
not to accept this donation because of the appearance that STU is
seeking an advantage or preference from the Department.</p>

<p>E. General</p>

<p>1. Departmental agencies may develop policies regarding
donation activities that are more but not less restrictive than
these guidelines.</p>

<p>2. Departmental agencies authorized to receive donations
should have in place the necessary procedures and systems to
ensure a complete and proper accounting for donated funds and
other in-kind gifts.</p>

<p>3. For further guidance regarding the application or
implementation of these guidelines, Departmental employees should
consult with the Solicitor's Office.(including Regional or Field
Offices) or the Department Ethics Office. Any written agreements
with non-Departmental entities relating to donation activities
should be approved by the Solicitor's Office and the Department
Ethics Office.</p>

<p>4. These guidelines do not alter or affect the application of
the standards of ethical conduct for employees of the executive
branch.</p>

<p>5. Any specific legislation that establishes guidance for the
activities addressed in these guidelines takes precedence over
these guidelines.</p>
