SUMMARY: The Assistant Secretary for Elementary and Secondary Education 
(Assistant Secretary) of the Department of Education (Department) will 
convene five regional meetings to solicit additional public comment on 
the Department's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) published 
elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register. The NPRM would 
implement recent changes made by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 
(NCLB Act) to the standards and assessment requirements under Title I 
of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended 
(ESEA). The proposed regulations were subjected to a negotiated 
rulemaking process, and we invited the public to submit comments on 
them. The Assistant Secretary is convening these regional meetings to 
provide the public additional opportunities to comment on the proposed 
regulations.

DATES: We will hold five regional meetings as listed in the Schedule of 
Regional Meetings under SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION.

Background

    On January 8, 2002, President George W. Bush signed the NCLB Act, 
amending the ESEA. The NCLB Act incorporated major education reforms 
proposed by the President in his No Child Left Behind initiative, 
particularly in the areas of assessment, accountability, and school 
improvement. Among other things, the NCLB Act reauthorizes--for a six-
year period--the programs under Title I of the ESEA (Title I programs), 
which are designed to help disadvantaged children reach high academic 
standards.
    Section 1901 of Title I of the ESEA contains procedures that the 
Department must follow in developing and issuing regulations to govern 
the Title I programs. Consistent with those requirements, the Secretary 
obtained the advice and recommendations of representatives of Federal, 
State, and local administrators; parents; teachers; paraprofessionals; 
members of local boards of education; and other organizations involved 
with the implementation and operation of the Title I programs. After 
obtaining this advice, the Secretary conducted a negotiated rulemaking 
process on issues relating to Title I standards and assessment 
requirements. The negotiated rulemaking process produced proposed 
regulations on these issues that the Secretary is publishing without 
change in the NPRM. The preamble to the NPRM describes in more thorough 
detail this regulatory process.

Regional Meetings

    In addition to the invitation to comment contained in the NPRM, the 
Assistant Secretary is offering an opportunity for the public to 
provide

[[Page 30462]]

input regarding the proposed regulations at the scheduled regional 
meetings.
    During the morning of each meeting, from 9 a.m. to 12 noon, 
representatives of the Department will provide background information 
on the statutory context for the NPRM, the negotiated rulemaking 
process, and the major issues that the proposed regulations are 
designed to address. Expert educators will also present their findings 
and experiences in the field of standards and assessments. During the 
afternoon of each meeting, from 1 p.m. to 5:15 p.m., the public will 
have the opportunity to offer oral or written comments, or both, on the 
NPRM.

Public Comments

    The Department will consider all comments obtained during these 
regional meetings, along with all other comments submitted to the 
Department in response to the NPRM. During and after the comment 
period, you may inspect all public comments about these proposed 
regulations in room 3W204, FB-6, 400 Maryland Avenue, SW., Washington, 
DC, between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 4 p.m., Eastern time, Monday 
through Friday of each week except Federal holidays.
