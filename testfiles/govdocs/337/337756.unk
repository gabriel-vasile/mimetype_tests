SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

17 CFR Parts 230 and 232

[Release No. 33-7188; File No. S7-18-95]

RIN 3235-AG52

Solicitations of Interest Prior to an Initial Public Offering.

AGENCY:   Securities and Exchange Commission.

ACTION:   Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.

SUMMARY:  The Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission")
is publishing for comment a proposed rule that would allow
issuers contemplating initial public offerings to solicit
indications of investor interest in their companies prior to the
filing of a registration statement under the Securities Act of
1933.  The proposed rule would allow an issuer to assess
potential investor interest in the company before incurring
possibly significant costs associated with the preparation of
offering disclosure documents.  The proposals are intended to
reduce the regulatory impediments and cost of accessing public
markets consistent with investor protection interests.

DATES:  Comments must be submitted on or before September 8,
1995.

ADDRESSES:  Comments should be submitted in triplicate to
Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission,
450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549.  Comment letters
should refer to File No. S7-18-95.  All comments received will be
available for public inspection and copying in the Commission's
public reference room, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C.,
20549.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:  Richard K. Wulff, Office of
Small Business Policy, Division of Corporation Finance, at (202)

of Corporation Finance, at (202) 942-2910.  

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  The Commission is publishing for
comment a rule -[1]- that would permit an issuer prior to its
initial public offering ("IPO") to solicit indications of
interest in the company's securities before filing a registration
statement under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities
Act"). -[2]-  The Commission also is proposing to amend the "test
the waters" provision -[3]- under Regulation A -[4]- to permit
issuers that "test the waters" under Regulation A and decide to
have a registered offering instead to do so without a 30 day
waiting period, as well as permitting issuers to use Regulation A
if, after "testing the waters" under the proposed new rule, they
determine to go forward with a  Regulation A offering instead of
a registered offering. -[5]-  In addition, Securities Act

Rule 100 -[6]- would be amended to add a definition of direct
participation investment program for purposes of the new rule,
and Regulation S-T -[7]- would be amended to provide that the
"test the waters" document for registered offerings may be
submitted to the Commission in electronic format via the EDGAR
system, at the option of the issuer.   

I.   BACKGROUND
     In 1992, as part of its Small Business Initiatives, the
Commission introduced new procedures into Regulation A that allow
issuers considering whether to undertake a public offering to
"test the waters" for potential investor interest before
undertaking a full-scale offering that requires the preparation,
Commission filing and delivery to investors of the mandated
offering documentation. -[8]-  The initiative was intended to
provide a cost-effective means for an issuer, with no established
market for its securities, to determine whether there is any
investor interest in its securities before undertaking an
offering and incurring the full costs of compliance with the
applicable disclosure requirements.  If, after the solicitation,
the issuer concludes there is insufficient or no investor
interest, it can avoid significant, unnecessary compliance costs.
If the issuer determines to proceed with the offering, it is
required to provide potential investors with the full mandated
disclosure documents.  Since adoption of the "test the waters"
procedures, 61 issuers have submitted solicitations to the
Commission, 26 of which have proceeded to file Regulation A or
registered offerings.  
     In 1993, the North American Securities Administrators
Association, Inc. ("NASAA") -[9]- undertook a two-year pilot
program to consider and evaluate a "test the waters" approach
under state securities laws. -[10]-  Nine states -[11]- have been
participating in the pilot.  The NASAA pilot procedures differ
from those adopted under Regulation A in several respects, the
most significant of which are: (a) a pre-use filing requirement;
(b) more mandated information in the solicitation document;
-[12]- (c) a requirement that the written solicitation document

          activities; (3) a general indication of the manner of
          using proposed proceeds from the offering; and (4) a
          complete listing of the issuer's officers and

be delivered to those directly contacted; and (d) delivery of the
prospectus at least seven days prior to sale.  Several classes of
issuers are disqualified from using the NASAA pilot "test the
waters" procedures. 
     Various commenters have suggested that the Commission
explore extending the benefits of the "test the waters" process
beyond Regulation A. -[13]-  Most recently, the Subcouncil on
Capital Allocation of the Competitiveness Policy Council -[14]-
recommended that in the interest of facilitating small business
capital raising, these issuers be permitted to "test the waters"
in advance of undertaking a registered IPO.
     Experience under Regulation A suggests that the "test the
waters" initiative provides issuers of small offerings a useful
and cost-effective means of assessing whether there is sufficient
potential interest in the company as an investment to proceed
with a Regulation A offering.  To date, these solicitations do
not appear to have raised significant investor protection
concerns.  Accordingly, the Commission today is soliciting
comment on the appropriateness of providing a similar "test the
waters" option for registered IPOs. -[15]-
     In considering whether to provide a "test the waters"
process for registered IPO's, the Commission is committed to
assuring that the interests of investors are not compromised.

          Committee of the Section of Business Law of the
          American Bar Association on the Small Business
          Initiatives suggested in 1992 that the Commission
          explore extending use of "test the waters" beyond the

          dated July 8, 1992 in response to request for comment

-[15]-    The Commission has established the Advisory Committee
          on the Capital Formation and Regulatory Processes (the
          "Advisory Committee"), chaired by Commissioner Steven
          M.H. Wallman.  The Advisory Committee is considering
          fundamental issues relating to the regulatory framework
          governing the capital formation process, including
          whether the current system of registering securities
          offerings should be replaced with a company
          registration system.  The recommendations of the
          Advisory Committee may result in rule proposals or
          legislative recommendations that, if implemented, may
          also address the matters discussed in this release. 
          While some of the company registration models under
          consideration generally would not change the
          requirements by which a company that was not filing
          reports with the SEC conducts an IPO, certain company
          registration models could facilitate solicitations of
          interest by registered companies with respect to repeat
          offerings, by eliminating the requirement for
          registering each public offering of securities.

conditions that go beyond those currently required in connection
with Regulation A offerings.  These comments are intended to
provide a basis for the Commission to assess the need for any or
all of these provisions to assure that investors have the full
opportunity to review and consider the information mandated by
the Securities Act in making their investment decision, and that
the solicitation of interest communications are not such as to
cause investors to overlook the mandated disclosures. -[16]-
     The IPO market is one of the great strengths of the U.S.
capital markets, and its breadth and depth is unique. -[17]-  In
the first five years of the 1990's, $114.8 billion have been
raised in the common equity IPO market. -[18]-  Continued
investor confidence is key to maintaining the strength and
vitality of this market, and any "test the waters" process
implemented by the Commission will have to be consistent with
maintaining this confidence.

II.  PROPOSALS
     A.   Description of proposed Rule 135d
     Under the proposal, an eligible issuer considering a
registered IPO would be permitted to solicit indications of
interest prior to filing a registration statement under the
Securities Act, subject to the conditions and limitations of
proposed new Rule 135d.  While assuring that investors receive
information mandated by the Securities Act before making an
investment, the proposed rule would allow companies to gauge
investor interest before incurring the significant expense
required in the preparation of IPO disclosure documents.  If
market interest is not reflected by the response to the
solicitation, companies may turn to other capital-raising plans.
-[19]-
 
     Under the current system, this would only be determined
after preparation of all required compliance materials, which may
involve significant expense.  The efficiency of the capital
markets, and the fiscal health of developing enterprises, is not
benefited by issuers' finding out later rather than sooner that
the public markets are not the most appropriate forums for their
capital raising.  On the contrary, the efficiency of the capital
raising process is enhanced when issuers that spend the large
sums required for an IPO have some indication as to how an
offering will be received.  The proposal would allow issuers to
structure their offerings with consideration for their particular
needs as well as the needs of investors, since issuers would be
                    
-------- FOOTNOTES --------

-[16]-    A discussion of the legal basis for the proposed rule
          is in Section C of the release; comment is specifically
          solicited on this issue.
-[17]-    See, e.g. Foreign Firms Flock to U.S. for IPOs, Wall
          Street Journal, June 23, 1995, at C1.
-[18]-    Securities Data Company.  This includes foreign
          companies' first common equity offerings in the U.S.;
          it does not include asset-backed securities.
-[19]-    Limitations on general solicitation under Regulation D
          [17 CFR 230.501-230.508] and case law under Section
          4(2) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C.77d(2)] may limit
          companies' flexibility in pursuing such alternatives. 
          Comment is requested in the discussion hereinafter as
          to what steps the Commission should take to address
          these issues.  In a companion release published today,
          the Commission is soliciting comment on various
          possible approaches to allowing general solicitations
          in some form in Regulation D offerings.  See Release
          No. 33-7185.

able to receive indications from potential investors concerning
what offering structure may be of interest, and could then use
that information in structuring their offerings. 
     Communications meeting the requirements of the proposed rule
would not be deemed to offer any security for sale -[20]- for
purposes of Section 5 of the Securities Act. -[21]-  As proposed,
those eligible to use the new rule would include any issuer not
reporting under Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), -[22]- but not: -[23]-

     (a)  issuers of asset-backed offerings; -[24]-
     (b)  partnerships, limited liability companies and other
          direct participation investment programs; -[25]-
     (c)  investment companies registered or required to be
          registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940;
          -[26]-  or
     (d)  blank check or penny stock issuers. -[27]-

The first three exclusions apply to those issuers that appear
unsuited to a "test the waters" concept, given the complex and
contractual nature of the issuer.  Blank check and penny stock
issuers are excluded because of the substantial abuses that have
arisen in such offerings.  Comment is requested as to the
appropriateness of the proposed exclusions.  Are there any
issuers proposed to be excluded that should be provided the
benefits of the "test the waters" process?  Are there additional
classes of issuers that should be excluded either because of the
nature of the investment vehicle or potential for abuse?  Should
any of the exclusions in the NASAA draft policy statement be
specifically incorporated into the proposal? -[28]-  Should the
rule be limited to small business issuers? -[29]-
     As in the case of Regulation A, the proposed IPO "test the
waters" solicitation may include both oral and written
solicitations, provided that a written solicitation document is
submitted to the Commission at or prior to the time the
solicitation is first made. -[30]-  Unlike Regulation A, however,
the submission of the "test the waters" written materials would
be a condition to reliance on the rule.  Comment is requested as
to whether the rule should require that the written "test the
waters" solicitation material be submitted and subject to

     Any written solicitation or broadcast would be required to
include the following:

          securities for sale, and that any public offering to be
          made will be made by means of a prospectus that may be
          obtained from the issuer and that will contain detailed
          information about the company and management, as well
          as financial statements;

     *    a statement that no money is being solicited, or will
          be accepted;

     *    a statement that no sales will be made or commitments
          to purchase securities will be accepted until a
          registration statement is filed with the Commission and
          becomes effective or an appropriate exemption from
          registration is available and utilized; 

     *    a statement that indications of interest involve no
          obligation or commitment of any kind; and

     *    an identification of the issuer's chief executive
          officer and a brief and general description of its
          business and products. -[31]-

Comment is solicited as to whether each of the specified
disclosure items is needed in the IPO context.  Should any
additional information be required under the proposed rule? 
Comment is requested as to whether additional information should
be required in the soliciting material, such as that required by
the NASAA draft policy. -[32]-  Should the rule limit the amount
of information includable about financing plans such as the type
and amounts of securities that might be offered for sale, as well
as possible underwriting arrangements?  Should the mandated
information be required in any oral solicitation?
     Subject to the prescribed disclosure, the proposed rule
would permit other information to be included.  This information
specifically could include the type, amount, and price of the
securities to be offered, financial information (including
unaudited financial statements, and projections or other forward-
looking statements).   All such information, of course, would be
subject to antifraud prohibitions.  Comment is requested as to
whether information with this level of specificity about the
possible offering should be permitted, or, instead, whether the
information should be more limited, such as to information about
the company generally and its intention to conduct an initial
public offering.  
     The issuer would be permitted to include a coupon that could
be returned to the company indicating interest and requesting a
prospectus in the event the company determines to undertake a
public offering. -[33]-  The coupon would be required to state
clearly and separately that the indication of interest is not
binding and that no money should be sent.  Under the proposed
rule, issuers would not be permitted to include questions in the

coupon soliciting information about the investors' financial
profile, such as income, assets and investment history.  Comment
is requested as to whether this limitation is appropriate. -[34]-
     Under the rule as proposed, there is no restriction on the
means of dissemination of the "test the waters" solicitation.
-[35]-  Thus, the issuer could send the solicitation material to
prospective investors, or publish it in a newspaper or other
print media.  Use of broadcast media, whether radio or
television, would be permitted, as would electronic dissemination
through such media as the Internet or other data networks.  To
come within the protection of the proposed safe harbor, the
mandated disclosure provisions would have to be met with respect
to each publication or transmission.  Comment is requested as to
whether there should be restrictions on this type of
solicitation.  While unsolicited telephoning of investors could
be conducted, should such telephoning be prohibited by the
issuer, by broker/dealers, and other non-issuer personnel
altogether?  Should the rule require that any person directly
contacted be given a copy of the written solicitation material
required to be submitted to the Commission?  Should the rule
contain additional limitations on the statements allowed?  Should
the rule prescribe what information is permitted to be included? 
Should oral solicitations be limited or precluded?  For example,
should oral solicitations be limited to certain statements, or
limited to the information set forth in the written solicitation
material?  Should oral solicitations be limited to accredited
investors -[36]- or qualified institutional buyers? -[37]-  
     The proposed rule also would require that the writing or
script be submitted to the Commission.  Unlike the current
Regulation A "test the waters" provision, however, the submission
would be made only at the Commission's Washington, D. C.
headquarters. -[38]-  Also, as noted above, unlike the current
Regulation A "test the waters" provision, this submission would
be a condition to reliance upon the rule. -[39]-  Following the
submission of the written document or script of the broadcast,
                    
-------- FOOTNOTES --------

-[34]-    Rule 254 of Regulation A does not prohibit requests for
          such information in the coupon.  
-[35]-    If an issuer wants to maintain full flexibility to
          proceed with an offering under Regulation D and Section
          4(2) of the Securities Act, the means of dissemination
          of the "test the waters" solicitation would have to be
          consistent with the limitations under the regulation
          and statute.  See the companion release issued today,
          soliciting comment on the use of general solicitation
          in Regulation D offerings.  Release No. 33-7185.
-[36]-    See Rule 501(d) of Regulation D [17 CFR 230.501(d)].
-[37]-    See Rule 144A(a)(1) [17 CFR 230.144A(a)(1)].
-[38]-    Proposed Rule 135d(a)(3).  Under the proposed rule, the
          document would be submitted to the Commission, but not
          officially filed, and, like Rule 254 material, would be
          available for public inspection.  The "test the waters"
          submission could be submitted either in paper or via
          the Commission's EDGAR system.  See proposed amendment
          to Rule 101(b) of Regulation S-T [17 CFR 232.101(b)].  

          The proposed rule would contain a note stating that
          only solicitation of interest material that contains
          substantive changes from or additions to previously
          submitted material need be submitted.

-[39]-    Rule 254 of Regulation A provides that submission of
          the materials to the Commission is not a condition to
          the exemption.
 
-------------------- BEGINNING OF PAGE #8 -------------------

oral communications with prospective investors and other
broadcasts would be permitted.  All communications would be
subject to the antifraud provisions of the federal securities
laws. -[40]-  As is the case with Regulation A, -[41]- the
proposed rule could not be relied upon after the filing of a
registration statement. -[42]-  Thus, under the proposal, all
"test the waters" solicitations, written or oral, must terminate
at the time a registration statement for the offering is filed. 
Also, the proposal would, like Regulation A, -[43]- require that
20 days elapse between the last publication or delivery of the
solicitation document or broadcast and any sales of securities.
-[44]-  Should this apply to oral "test the waters" solicitations
as well?  
     Finally, the proposed rule, like Regulation A, -[45]- would
deem "test the waters" material submitted to the Commission and
otherwise in compliance with the rule not to be a "prospectus" as
defined in Section 2(10) of the Securities Act, -[46]- and
therefore not subject to Section 12(2) of the Securities
Act. -[47]-  Comment is requested as to the appropriateness of
removing these materials from Section 12(2) liabilities.  Should
"test the waters" soliciting material be required to be filed as
part of the registration statement for the IPO and subjected to
Sections 11 -[48]- and 12(2) liabilities if the registered
offering is conducted within a specified time period of the
solicitation, e.g. 2, 6 or 12 months?
     In Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., Inc., -[49]- the Supreme Court
concluded that the written instruments there at issue did not
constitute a "prospectus" as that term is used in Section 12(2)
of the Securities Act, notwithstanding the broad coverage of the
statutory definition of the term "prospectus" in Section 2(10) of
the Securities Act.  The Commission believes that its
determination that written documents of the type referred to in
proposed Rule 135d should not be deemed a prospectus, or part of
a prospectus, is an appropriate use of its authority both under
Sections 2(10) and 19(a).  It also believes that its proposal to
limit the breadth of the term "prospectus" is not inconsistent
with the Supreme Court's decision in Gustafson.  
     As noted above, the proposed rule requires that no sales of
securities occur until at least 20 days after the last
publication or delivery of the solicitation document or

broadcast. -[50]-  Comment is requested as to whether or not pre-
confirmation prospectus delivery requirements -[51]- should be
revised to permit investors a longer period of time than they
have currently, e.g., seven days (instead of the current 48
hours) to consider prospectus information where the "test the
waters" process has been used.  Comment is requested as to the
need for additional procedures to assure investors a sufficient
opportunity following a "test the waters" solicitation to review
and assess the full information about the issuer, its management,
the securities and the offering provided by the registration
statement and prospectus.  Comment also is requested as to
whether or not there is a need to require that all "test the
waters" solicitations, written or oral, cease at some period of
time prior to the filing of a registration statement for an IPO. 
Given the purpose of the proposed rule, allowing issuers to
determine whether to undertake a registered IPO before incurring
the costs of complying with the disclosure and other related
requirements, would such a cooling-off period be consistent with
financing schedules?  Due diligence and preparation of documents
typically takes 60 to 90 days. -[52]-  Comment is requested as to
the need for a cooling-off period prior to the commencement of a
registered offering, and the period of time that would be
appropriate, e.g. 30 days or 60 days. 
     Under Regulation A, failure to comply with the terms and
conditions of the "test the waters" procedures can result in a
Commission order suspending a Regulation A exemption.  Under
proposed Rule 135d, just as with Rule 135, full compliance with
the terms and conditions of the rule is required to come within
the safe harbor provisions of the rule.  Comment is requested as
to whether there should be a provision addressing failures to
comply with the provisions that would provide adequate protection
to investors, preclude undue conditioning of the market, allow
timely oversight of the contents of the written solicitation
material, and avoid loss of the safe harbor for technical,
immaterial deviations from the specific requirements of the safe
harbor.
       With respect to investor protection, today's proposals
would not alter the type and amount of information available to
investors in connection with an IPO.  Issuers making use of the
proposed "test the waters" procedure would continue to be subject
to all the current IPO disclosure requirements, and IPO
registration statements would continue to be subject to
Commission staff review if the issuer determined to proceed with
a registered offering after soliciting investor interest.  
     Comment is requested generally on whether the proposed "test
the waters" rule is appropriate and in investors' interest in the
context of registered IPOs.  Will the proposed process
effectively accomplish the Commission's goal of allowing
businesses to assess the capital market's potential interest in

-[50]-    Of course, if the issuer were to comply with both
          proposed Rule 135d and Rule 505 (or 506) of Regulation
          D, [17 CFR 230.505 and 230.506, respectively] and it
          were decided not to proceed with an IPO, it could sell
          immediately under Rule 505 (506).  Similarly, if an
          issuer were to comply with both Rule 135d and Rule 504
          [17 CFR 230.504] (which does permit general
          solicitation), sales could proceed immediately without
          waiting 20 days in the event the issuer determines not
          to go the IPO route.

their businesses on a cost-effective basis, without causing
investors to overlook the full disclosures mandated by the
federal securities laws?  

     B.   Relationship of exempt offerings to "test the waters"
          activity

     After an issuer has engaged in a "test the waters" procedure
under the proposed rule, it might conclude that, rather than
having a registered offering, it would be desirable to raise
capital by means of a Regulation A, private -[53]- or
Regulation D offering.  In order to accommodate the issuer's
flexibility to use Regulation A, that Regulation's "test the
waters" rule would be amended to make it clear that "testing the
waters" under the proposed new rule could be followed by a
Regulation A offering, -[54]- just as an issuer that "tests the
waters" under Regulation A could ultimately determine to have a
registered offering instead. -[55]-  Comment is solicited on
whether proposed Rule 135d should be used for "testing the
waters" with a view to either a registered or a Regulation A
offering, thus replacing Rule 254.
     With respect to offerings relying on an exemption other than
Regulation A, it is noted that under Rule 502(c) of Regulation D,
-[56]-
any form of general solicitation or general advertising would
preclude availability of the exemptions provided by Rules 505 and
506. -[57]-  Thus, if the issuer's "test the waters" activity was
done in a way that involved general advertising or other
activities constituting general solicitation, -[58]- it could not
proceed directly to an offering relying on an exemption that
precluded general solicitation, even if the parties expected to
purchase in the exempt offering were accredited investors. -[59]-
Just as with any other party relying on such an exemption, the
issuer would have to ensure that the exempt offering would not be
integrated with the "test the waters" activity, -[60]- either by
relying on the safe harbor afforded for transactions occurring
more than six months before and after the Regulation D
transaction, -[61]- or by otherwise ensuring that the
transactions were distinct enough so that they would not be

-[54]-    Proposed Rule 254(b)(4).
-[55]-    See Rule 254(d).  This provision would be amended to
          eliminate the 30 day waiting period currently required
          before filing a registration statement.
-[56]-    17 CFR 230.502(c).
-[57]-    Because public offerings are permitted under Rule 504,
          the following discussion about "general solicitation"
          would not apply to transactions pursuant to that
          exemption.
-[58]-    This would depend upon the manner and scope of the
          dissemination of the "test the waters" communication. 
          The determination as to whether the activities
          constituted a general solicitation would hinge upon the
          particular facts and circumstances of individual
          situations.
-[59]-    17 CFR 230.501(a).
-[60]-    See Rule 502(a) of Regulation D [17 CFR 230.502(a)],
          which enumerates factors to be considered in
          determining whether offers and sales should be
          integrated for purposes of the exemptions under
          Regulation D.
-[61]-    Rule 502(a).
 
-------------------- BEGINNING OF PAGE #11 -------------------

integrated under the five-factors test. -[62]-  This is
comparable to the treatment of Regulation A "test the waters"
activity. -[63]-
     The Commission recognizes that the possibility of
integrating "test the waters" activity with private or Regulation
D offerings could impair the usefulness of proposed Rule 135d. 
In a companion release that proposes a new exemption from
registration for offerings made in compliance with a recently
enacted California exemption, -[64]- the Commission is soliciting
public comment on a variety of approaches to general
solicitation, including whether the prohibition against general
solicitation for Rule 505 and 506 offerings should be rescinded,
whether it would be feasible to reduce restrictions but limit the
information allowed to be disseminated or the manner of
dissemination, and other approaches.   Would another approach be
to provide a special integration safe harbor for private
placements following a Rule 135d "test the waters" solicitation? 
     For example, would the 20 day period proposed between the
last "test the waters" document or broadcast and any sale be an
appropriate safe harbor for non-integration of a sale to
accredited investors following a "test the waters" solicitation?

     C.   Communications that are not "offers"
     As noted, proposed Rule 135d would provide that any
communication meeting the conditions of the rule, as described
above, is not deemed to offer any securities for sale, for
purposes only of Section 5 of the Securities Act.  Thus, "test
the waters" activity could take place without the filing of a
Securities Act registration statement or an available exemption
from registration.
     The Commission is cognizant that rulemaking in this area is
circumscribed by the statute's prohibition of conduct
constituting an "offer" prior to the filing of a registration
statement. -[65]-   The application of this definition to
differing forms of pre-filing communications will, of course,
vary.  In proposing Rule 135d for comment, it is the Commission's
intention to examine further the elements of the types of pre-
filing activity that would be most constructive for IPOs and
investors, as well as the appropriate limitations or parameters
of such activity.  
     The Commission has previously had occasion to consider the
application of the statute to other types of public
communications made prior to the filing of a registration
statement, both in rules and in interpretive positions. -[66]- 
                    
-------- FOOTNOTES --------

-[62]-    The five-factors integration test is set forth in
          Securities Act Release No. 4552 (November 6, 1962)[27
          FR 11316].
-[63]-    See Release No. 33-6949, Part II.B.
-[64]-    Release No. 33-7185.       
-[65]-    Section 2(3) [15 U.S.C. 77b(3)] provides, in pertinent
          part:

          The term "offer to sell", "offer for sale",
          or "offer" shall include every attempt or
          offer to dispose of, or solicitation of an
          offer to buy, a security or interest in a
          security, for value.
 
-[66]-    The Commission has indicated that the Securities Act
          allows the following public communications, among
          others, prior to the filing of a registration
          statement:
                                                   (continued...)
 
-------------------- BEGINNING OF PAGE #12 -------------------

The Commission has also cautioned that certain publicity efforts
in advance of a proposed public offering, although not couched in
terms of an express offer, may raise questions under the statute
if they contribute to conditioning the public market or arousing
public interest in an issuer or its securities before a
registration statement is filed. -[67]-  In the context of exempt
public offerings for small businesses under Section 3(b) and
Regulation A, the Commission has indicated that "test the waters"
activities pursuant to Rule 254 are considered offers for
purposes of Section 2(3). -[68]-  The Commission intends to
examine these and other interpretations of the relevant statutory
provisions in considering the historical scope of permissible
"test the waters" activities and the appropriateness of the
provisions of proposed Rule 135d.  
     Recognizing these statutory limitations, the Commission
requests comment as to whether alternative means are available to
permit issuers to gather data efficiently to assist them in

assessing the likelihood that a contemplated offering will be
successful.  For example, could a simplified registration
procedure be adopted in which "test the waters" practices are
made pursuant to a filed, but extremely simplified, registration
statement, with normal, extensive information to be filed by
amendment if an offering proceeds?  Would this approach be
consistent with Sections 7 and 10 of the Securities Act, -[69]-
which allow the Commission to define the contents of a
registration statement and a prospectus, respectively?  Would the
modest additional burden of filing "test the waters" materials as
a technical registration statement render the procedure
substantially less useful for issuers?  Would issuers use a
process that requires the inclusion of the "test the waters"
materials in a registration statement subject to Section 11 or a
prospectus subject to Section 12(2) of the Securities Act?

III. REQUEST FOR COMMENT
     Any interested persons wishing to submit written comments on
the proposed expansion of the "test the waters" procedure to
IPOs, as well as on other matters that might have an impact on
the proposals contained herein, are requested to do so.  Comments
are requested on the impact of the proposals on issuers,
investors, and others.  The Commission also requests comment on
whether the proposed rules, if adopted, would have an adverse
impact on competition that is neither necessary nor appropriate
in furthering the purposes of the Securities Act.  Comments will
be considered by the Commission in complying with its
responsibilities under Section 23(a) of the Exchange Act. -[70]- 
Comment letters should refer to File No. S7-18-95.  All comments
received will be available for public inspection and copying in
the Commission's Public Reference Room, 450 Fifth Street, N.W.,
Washington, D.C. 20549.

IV.  COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS
     To assist the Commission in its evaluation of the costs and
benefits that may result from the proposals, commenters are
requested to provide views and data relating to any costs and
benefits associated with these proposals.  The proposals, which
are intended to reduce complexity and potentially significant
costs to an issuer in connection with the planning for an IPO,
while not sacrificing investor protection, are expected to reduce
the costs associated with IPOs.  The Commission is not proposing
to increase the burdens on any issuer that chooses to engage in
an IPO.  Use of the proposed "test the waters" procedure would be
optional.  Further, any cost associated with the preparation of
the proposed "test the waters" document would be offset by the
significant benefits that issuers would receive in the reduction
of costs.  Those benefits also include a higher degree of
assurance that a particular offering will find a receptive
market.

V.   SUMMARY OF THE INITIAL REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ANALYSIS
     An initial regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared
in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 603 concerning the proposed new rule
and amendments.  The analysis notes that the amendments are
intended to reduce costs associated with IPOs.
     As discussed more fully in the analysis, the proposals would
affect persons that are small entities, as defined by the
Commission's rules, but would affect small entities in the same
manner as other registrants.  The proposed rule and amendments,

        TITLE: RESOLUTION OF THE NORTH AMERICAN SECURITIES
     ADMINISTRATORS ASSOCIATION, INC., REGARDING THE TESTING-
                       THE-WATERS EXEMPTION

     WHEREAS, NASAA recognizes the policy objectives underlying
the testing-the-waters exemption drafted by its working group,
but has substantial concerns as to whether it can adequately
ensure that investors are protected,

     THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that NASAA will take no formal
action with regard to the proposal so that a two year pilot
program may be undertaken by those jurisdictions electing to do
so and the results of the program may be carefully considered.

  Adopted by the membership of the North American Securities
Administrators Association on April 25, 1993 at its Spring
Meeting in Washington, D.C.
                 
           PROPOSED STATEMENT OF POLICY ON SOLICITATION
                  OF INTEREST (TEST THE WATERS)

NOTE:  THIS PROPOSED RULE HAS NOT BEEN ADOPTED BY THE NASAA
MEMBERSHIP BY A RESOLUTION ADOPTED APRIL 25, 1993, THE
MEMBERSHIP
VOTED TO TAKE NO ACTION ON THE PROPOSAL PENDING A STUDY OF ITS
EFFECT IN THOSE JURISDICTIONS THAT CHOOSE TO ADOPT ITS USE ON AN
EXPERIMENTAL BASIS.  IT IS BEING PUBLISHED SOLELY TO PROVIDE A
UNIFORM BASIS FOR THIS PILOT PROJECT THAT WILL ATTEMPT TO
DETERMINE IF SUCH AN EXEMPTIVE RULE CAN BE IMPLEMENTED
WITHOUT
JEOPARDIZING INVESTOR PROTECTION.

Solicitations of Interest prior to the Filing of the Registration
Statement:

(1)  An offer, but not a sale, of a security made by or on behalf
     of an issuer for the sole purpose of soliciting an
     indication of interest in receiving a prospectus (or its
     equivalent) for such security is exempt from section [301]
     of the Act if all of the following conditions are satisfied:

     (a)  The issuer is or will be a business entity organized
          under the laws of one of the states or possessions of
          the United States or one of the provinces or
          territories of Canada, is engaged in or proposes to
          engage in a business other than petroleum exploration
          or production or mining or other extractive industries
          and is not a "blind pool" offering or other offering
          for which the specific business or properties cannot
          now be described.

     (b)  The offerer intends to register the security in this
          state and conduct its offering pursuant to either
          Regulation A or Rule 504 of Regulation D, as
          promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

     (c)  Ten (10) business days prior to the initial
          solicitation of interest under this rule, the offerer
          files with the [Administrator] a Solicitation of
          Interest Form along with any other materials to be used
          to conduct solicitations of interest, including, but
          not limited to, the script of any broadcast to be made
          and a copy of any notice to be published.
 
-------------------- BEGINNING OF PAGE #18 -------------------


     (d)  Five (5) business days prior to usage, the offerer
          files with the [Administrator] any amendments to the
          foregoing materials or additional materials to be used
          to conduct solicitations of interest, except for
          materials provided to a particular offeree pursuant to
          a request by that offeree.

     (e)  No Solicitation of Interest Form, script, advertisement
          or other material which the offerer has been notified
          by the [Administrator] not to distribute is used to
          solicit indications of interest.

     (f)  Except for scripted broadcasts and published notices, 
          the offerer does not communicate with any offeree about
          the contemplated offering unless the offeree is
          provided with the most current Solicitation of Interest
          Form at or before the time of the communication or
          within five (5) days from the communication.

     (g)  During the solicitation of interest period, the offerer
          does not solicit or accept money or a commitment to
          purchase securities.

     (h)  No sale is made until seven (7) days after delivery to
          the purchaser of a prospectus.  [Alternative: No sale
          is made until seven (7) days after delivery to the
          purchaser of a final prospectus, or in those instances
          in which delivery of a preliminary prospectus is
          allowed hereunder, a preliminary prospectus.]-[76]-

     (i)  The offerer does not know, and in the exercise of
          reasonable care, could not know that the issuer or any
          of the issuer's officers, directors, ten percent
          shareholders or promoters:

          1.   Has filed a registration statement which is the
               subject of a currently effective registration stop
               order entered pursuant to any federal or state
               securities law within five years prior to the
               filing of the Solicitation of Interest Form.

          2.   Has been convicted within five years prior to the
               filing of the Solicitation of Interest Form of any
               felony or misdemeanor in connection with the
               offer, purchase or sale of any security or any
               felony involving fraud or deceit, including, but
               not limited to forgery, embezzlement, obtaining
               money under false pretenses, larceny, or
               conspiracy to defraud.

          3.   Is currently subject to any federal or state
               administrative enforcement order or judgment
               entered by any state securities administrator or
               the Securities and Exchange Commission within five
               years prior to the filing of the Solicitation of
                    

-[76]-    The bracketed subsection should only be used in those
          jurisdictions that have or intend to adopt an
          applicable "red herring" exemption.  The "red herring"
          exemption should cross-reference this rule to avoid
          confusion.

               Interest Form or is subject to any federal or
               state administrative enforcement order or judgment
               entered within five years prior to the filing of
               the Solicitation of Interest Form in which fraud
               or deceit, including, but not limited to, making
               untrue statements of material facts and omitting
               to state material facts, was found.

          4.   Is subject to any federal or state administrative
               enforcement order or judgement which prohibits,
               denies, or revokes the use of any exemption from
               registration connection with the offer, purchase
               or sale of securities.

          5.   Is currently subject of any order, judgment, or
               decree of any court of competent jurisdiction
               temporarily or preliminarily restraining or
               enjoining, or is subject to any order, judgment or
               decree of any court of competent jurisdiction
               permanently restraining or enjoining, such party
               from engaging in or continuing any conduct or
               practice in connection with the purchase or sale
               of any security or involving the making of any
               false filing with the state entered within five
               years prior to the filing of the Solicitation of
               Interest Form.        

          The prohibitions listed above shall not apply if the
          person subject to the disqualification is duly licensed
          or registered to conduct securities related business in
          the state in which the administrative order or judgment
          was entered against such person or if the broker/dealer
          employing such party is licensed or registered in this
          state and the Form B-D filed with this state discloses
          the order, conviction, judgment or decree relating to
          such person.  No person disqualified under this
          subsection may act in a capacity other than that for
          which the person is licensed or registered.  Any
          disqualification caused by this section is
          automatically waived if the agency which created the
          basis for disqualification determines upon a showing of
          good cause that it is not necessary under the
          circumstances that the exemption be denied.

(2)  A failure to comply with any condition of section (1) of
     this rule will not result in the loss of the exemption from
     the requirements of section [301] of this Act for any offer
     to a particular individual or entity if the offerer shows:

          (a)  the failure to comply did not pertain to a
               condition directly intended to protect that
               particular individual or entity; and

          (b)  the failure to comply was insignificant with
               respect to the offering as a whole; and

          (c)  a good faith and reasonable attempt was made to
               comply with all applicable conditions of section
               (1).

          Where an exemption is established only through reliance
          upon this section (2), the failure to comply shall
          nonetheless be actionable as a violation of the Act by
          the [Administrator] under section [408] of the Act and
 
-------------------- BEGINNING OF PAGE #20 -------------------

          constitute grounds for denying or revoking the
          exemption as to a specific security or transaction.

(3)  The offerer shall comply with the requirements set forth
     below.  Failure to comply will not result in the loss of the
     exemption from the requirements of section [301] of this
     Act, but shall be a violation of the Act, be actionable by
     the [Administrator] under section [408] of the Act, and
     constitute grounds for denying or revoking the exemption as
     to a specific security or transaction.

          (a)  Any published notice or script for broadcast must
               contain at least the identity of the chief
               executive officer of the issuer, a brief and
               general description of its business and products
               and the following legends:

               1.   NO MONEY OR OTHER CONSIDERATION IS BEING
                    SOLICITED AND NONE WILL BE ACCEPTED;

               2.   NO SALES OF THE SECURITIES WILL BE MADE OR
                    COMMITMENT TO PURCHASE ACCEPTED UNTIL
                    DELIVERY OF AN OFFERING CIRCULAR THAT
                    INCLUDES COMPLETE INFORMATION ABOUT THE
                    ISSUER AND THE OFFERING;

               3.   AN INDICATION OF INTEREST MADE BY A
                    PROSPECTIVE INVESTOR INVOLVES NO OBLIGATION
                    OR COMMITMENT OF ANY KIND;
 
               and

               4.   THIS OFFER IS BEING MADE PURSUANT TO AN
                    EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE FEDERAL
                    AND STATE SECURITIES LAWS.  NO SALE MAY BE
                    MADE UNTIL THE OFFERING STATEMENT IS
                    QUALIFIED BY THE SEC AND IS REGISTERED IN
                    THIS STATE.

          (b)  All communications with prospective investors made
               in reliance on this rule must cease after a
               registration statement is filed in this state, and
               no sale may be made until at least twenty (20)
               calendar days after the last communication made in
               reliance on this rule.

          [(c) A preliminary  prospectus (or its equivalent) may
               only be used in connection with an offering for
               which indications of interest have been solicited
               under this rule if the offering is conducted by a
               registered broker-dealer.]-[77]-

(4)  The [Administrator] may waive any condition of this
     exemption in writing, upon application by the offerer and
     cause having been shown.  Neither compliance nor attempted
     compliance with this rule, nor the absence of any objection
     or order by the [Administrator] with respect to any offer of
     securities undertaken pursuant to this rule, shall be deemed
     to be a waiver of any condition of the rule or deemed to be

-------- FOOTNOTES --------                    

-[77]-    See footnote 1.
 
-------------------- BEGINNING OF PAGE #21 -------------------

     a confirmation by the [Administrator] of the availability of
     this rule.  

(5)  Offers made in reliance on this rule will not result in a
     violation of Section 301 of the Act by virtue of being
     integrated with subsequent offers or sales of securities
     unless such subsequent offers and sales would be integrated
     under federal securities laws.

(6)  Issuers on whose behalf indications of interest are
     solicited under this rule may not make offers or sales in
     reliance on section[s] [private placement exemption]-[78]-
     until [six (6)]-[79]- months after the last communication
     with a prospective investor made pursuant to this rule.


COMMENTS:  

1.   All communications made in reliance on this rule are subject
     to the anti-fraud provisions of this Act.

2.   The [Administrator] may or may not review the materials
     filed pursuant to this rule.  Materials filed, if reviewed,
     will be judged under anti-fraud principles.  Any discussion
     in the offering documents of the potential rewards of the
     investment must be balanced by a discussion of possible
     risks.

3.   Any offer effected in violation of this rule may constitute
     an unlawful offer of an unregistered security for which
     civil liability attaches under Section [410] of the Act.
     Likewise any misrepresentation or omission may give rise to
     civil liability.  Under the Uniform Securities Act a
     subsequent registration of the security for the sale of the
     security does not "cure" the previous unlawful offer. Only a
     rescission offer made in accordance with the provisions of
     the Act can accomplish such a "cure." See commentary under
     Section 410.

     NOTE TO USERS: The following form sets forth the minimum
informational requirement for soliciting indications of interest
under federal and state securities laws.  You may include
additional information if you think it necessary or desirable. 
Remember that any discussion in this document is subject to the
anti-fraud provisions of the federal and state securities laws
and must thereby be complete.  Also, any discussion of potential
rewards of the proposed investment must be balanced by a
discussion of possible risks.  You may alter the graphic
presentation of the form in any way as long as the minimum
information is clearly presented.


                  SOLICITATION OF INTEREST FORM

                    

-[78]-    Each jurisdiction should review its exemptions to
          determine which ones should be denied if contaminated 
          by public solicitation.

-[79]-    Some jurisdictions may choose a twelve month period
          because the private placement exemptions already in
          their statutes use this time frame.
