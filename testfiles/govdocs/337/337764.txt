Subject: EEGLE Award - please respond by Tuesday, July 18

The field portion of the EEGLE program is essentially over and we (Dave
Schwab and I) thought that it was timly to consider a team award for the
successful completion of this effort. The list below is my draft of
participants deserving of awards and a list of Candidates on which I would
like your
comments. Without comments, I plan to include the candidate list
among the awardees. I also solicit suggestions of awards for my Others
catagory - how can we include them - they are neither CILER nor GLERL, but
have made substantial contributions. Finally, I solicit any names of folks
that I have missed - I have not included summer students except Brandon
Giroux - this is his 3rd summer and he has worked some during the school
year.  If there are other students who have worked more than one summer,
please let me know.  We are planning to request jackets for everyone - OK ?
