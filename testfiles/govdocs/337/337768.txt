WHITE HOUSE DRUG POLICY DIRECTOR MCCAFFREY MEETS WITH
LEADERS OF ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY COUNCIL, ADDRESSES
TOWN HALL FORUM IN LOS ANGELES
************************************************************
     (Washington, D.C.) -- White House Drug Policy Director Barry R.
McCaffrey will meet in Los Angeles January 9-10 with leaders of the
Entertainment Industries Council, a coalition of producers, 
directors, actors and distributors involved in creating America's 
mass media culture, to discuss ways to present a realistic portrayal 
of the consequences of drug abuse in America.

     During the visit, Director McCaffrey will address leaders of the
entertainment industry about the rise in teen drug use and the goals 
of the National Drug Control Strategy, as well as solicit their 
opinions about how popular media can more accurately reflect the 
realities of drug abuse.

     On January 10, at 12 noon at the Omni Hotel and Centre in 
downtown Los Angeles, Director McCaffrey will address the Los Angeles 
Town Hall Forum, a meeting of corporate, professional and community 
leaders interested in local, national and international issues.  He 
will also have private meetings with leaders of individual industry 
groups to listen to their views and solicit their advice on how
to mobilize the creative talents of the entertainment industry.

     "Hollywood writers, producers and directors are also parents, 
community leaders and educators in the best sense of the word, just 
like the rest of us," Director McCaffrey said.  "The entertainment 
industry has often been targeted unfairly in negative assessments of 
our popular culture.  We think the entertainment industry can play a 
strong positive role, and we are interested in learning how we can 
cooperate in reducing the impact of drug abuse in America. We owe 
it to our children to work together against the scourge of 
illegal drugs."

     Following the Los Angeles Town Hall Forum, Director McCaffrey will
meet with approximately 15 youth from South Central Los Angeles, and 
will then hold a press conference where he will address questions about 
drug messages inthe media and the federal government reaction to 
the passage of California's Proposition 215.
