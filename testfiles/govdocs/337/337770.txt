SUMMARY: The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 requires 
that the Postal Service and Federal agencies set strategic goals, 
measure performance, and report on results. It requires development, no 
later than by the end of fiscal year 1997, of a five-year strategic 
plan, to include the organization's mission statement, identify its 
long-term strategic goals, and describe how it intends to achieve its 
goals. The Act also requires that in developing its Strategic Plan, the 
Postal Service shall solicit and consider the ideas of those 
potentially affected by or interested in the Strategic Plan. This 
notice therefore asks for public comment concerning development of the 
Postal Service's Strategic Plan for the years 1998-2002.

DATES: Comments must be received by June 1, 1997.

ADDRESSES: Written comments should be directed to Robert A.F. Reisner, 
Vice President, Strategic Planning, U.S. Postal Service, 475 L'Enfant

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Statutory Background

    The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993, Public Law 103-
62, (GPRA) was enacted to make Federal programs more effective and 
publicly accountable by targeting results, service quality, and 
customer satisfaction. Other statutory goals were to improve 
Congressional decisionmaking and to improve internal management of the 
Federal Government. Public Law 103-62, section 2(b), 107 Stat 285. 
Because of the Postal Service's role as an independent establishment of 
the Executive Branch of the Government of the United States, section 7 
of the law establishes separate provisions which apply to the Postal 
Service (sections 2801-2805 of title 39, United States Code).
    Section 2802 of title 39, United States Code, requires that the 
Postal Service submit to the President and the Congress a strategic 
plan for its program activities, no later than September 30, 1997. The 
plan is to contain:

    (1) a comprehensive mission statement covering the major 
functions and operations of the Postal Service;
    (2) general goals and objectives, including outcome-related 
goals and objectives, for the major functions and operations of the 
Postal Service;
    (3) a description of how the goals and objectives are to be 
achieved, including a description of the operational processes, 
skills and technology, and the human, capital, information, and 
other resources required to meet those goals and objectives;
    (4) a description of how the performance goals included in the 
plan required under section 2803 shall be related to the general 
goals and objectives in the strategic plan;
    (5) an identification of those key factors external to the 
Postal Service and beyond its control that could significantly 
affect the achievement of the general goals and objectives; and
    (6) a description of the program evaluations used in 
establishing or revising general goals and objectives, with a 
schedule for future program evaluations.

39 U.S.C. 2802(a).

    The GPRA also requires the preparation of annual performance plans 
covering each program activity set forth in the Postal Service budget. 
39 U.S.C. 2803. These plans are to link the strategic goals in the 
Strategic Plan with ongoing operations. In addition, the law requires 
preparation of program performance reports, to review and compare 
performance with performance goals in the annual performance plan. 39 
U.S.C. 2804.
    In order to involve the public in the process, GPRA requires that, 
as it develops its strategic plan, the Postal Service ``shall solicit 
and consider the views and suggestions of those entities potentially 
affected by or interested in such a plan, and shall advise the Congress 
of the contents of the plan.'' 39 U.S.C. 2802(d).

Discussion of the Postal Service Mission and its Strategic Planning 
Process

    In 1970, the Congress enacted the Postal Reorganization Act, 
recasting the former Post Office Department as the United States Postal 
Service. Its intent was that the former department evolve into a 
Federal entity that operates more

[[Page 15741]]

like a business. While fulfilling its basic mission of providing 
universal service at a uniform price, the Postal Service would focus 
more clearly on the needs of all of its customers.

    * * *The Postal Service shall have as its basic function the 
obligation to provide postal services to bind the Nation together 
through the personal, educational, literary and business 
correspondence of the people. It shall provide prompt, reliable, and 
efficient services to patrons in all areas and shall render postal 
services to all communities.

39 U.S.C. 101(a).

    To carry out this mission of the United States Postal Service as 
described in section 101 of title 39, United States Code, the organic 
statute, a statement of mission was adopted in recent years:

    To provide every household and business across the United States 
with the ability to communicate and conduct business with each other 
and the world through prompt, reliable, secure and economic services 
for the collection, transportation and delivery of messages and 
merchandise.

    A statement of vision was also developed at the same time and reads 
as follows:

    Our postal products will be recognized as the best value in 
America. We will evolve into a provider of 21st century postal 
communications. We will be the most effective and productive service 
in the Federal Government and markets that we serve.

    The Postal Service seeks comment on this interpretation of mission 
and vision. In addition, the Postal Service seeks comment on the 
management goals discussed below.
    With its mandate to operate in a business-like manner, the Postal 
Service developed a 5-year Strategic Planning Process in the 1980's. 
The Postal Service also has been systematically reviewing performance 
and reforming processes. Since 1994, when the Postal Service applied 
the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award criteria to create a 
management system that is called CustomerPerfect!, the Postal Service 
has invested in a systematic revision of its management system, that is 
currently using process management tools to reform processes throughout 
the Service.
    The CustomerPerfect! process is designed to provide structure and 
discipline to achieve better results for postal customers. The 
CustomerPerfect! management cycle has four distinct phases which can be 
described as: Establish, Deploy, Implement and Review. The 
``Establish'' phase involves setting organizational direction, 
determining long and near-term goals, and making decisions about how to 
measure progress. The output is a set of broad goals and subgoals for a 
five-year period, as well as a process prioritizing specific subgoals, 
targets, and indicators for the coming year.
    The ``Deploy'' phase involves communicating goals to the 
organization, to seek individual unit contributions to the achievement 
of targets. The ``Implementation'' phase requires specific, measurable 
targets for improvement. The ``Review'' phase involves a periodic check 
on the system and its performance, whose primary value is learning what 
will help improve future results.
    Therefore, to comply with the requirements of GPRA to solicit and 
consider the views and suggestions of those entities potentially 
affected by or interested in such a plan, and to benefit from such 
guidance in the preparation of its strategic direction, the Postal 
Service is hereby requesting public comment on development of its 
Strategic Plan for the years 1998-2002.
    Comments are requested in particular concerning the Postal 
Service's priorities in sustaining and enhancing a viable twenty-first 
century Postal Service, as reflected in the following goals developed 
as part of the CustomerPerfect! process:

    (1) Improve customer satisfaction by offering superior customer 
value in each market and customer segment;
    (2) Improve employee and organizational effectiveness by having 
the right people in the right place with the right tools at the 
right time to consistently provide superior customer value and 
ensure commercial viability in a dynamic environment;
    (3) Improve financial performance to assure our commercial 
viability as a service provider for the worldwide movement of 
messages, merchandise, and money.

    Any comments pertaining to how the Postal Service can best achieve 
these goals, or on other aspects of strategic planning, goals or 
performance measurement will be appreciated.
Stanley F. Mires,
Chief Counsel, Legislative.
