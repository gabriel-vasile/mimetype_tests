                             I.  INTRODUCTION

     1. In this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking we propose to modify our broadband personal
communications service (PCS) rules to expand our geographic partitioning provisions to include
all PCS licensees and to permit spectrum disaggregation in the near term. We also solicit
comment on certain issues relating to these rules.  Adoption of our proposals will implement the
Congressional mandate under Section 257 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended by
the Telecommunications Act of 1996 ("Communications Act"), to eliminate entry barriers into
the telecommunications market for small businesses.  These proposals also are consistent with
the directive of  Section 309(j) of the Communications Act to promote economic opportunity for
a wide variety of applicants including small businesses, rural telephone companies, and businesses
owned by members of minority groups and women.  We believe that the proposals made herein
will facilitate the efficient use of broadband PCS spectrum by providing licensees with additional
flexibility to tailor their business strategies, will increase competition by allowing market entry
by new players, and will expedite the provision of broadband PCS service to areas that may not
otherwise receive broadband PCS or other wireless services in the near term.
 
                          II.  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

     2.  As we regulate broadband PCS spectrum, we continually seek to improve the
efficiency of spectrum use, eliminate entry barriers, reduce unnecessary regulatory burdens on
spectrum users, encourage competition, and provide services to the largest feasible number of
users.  We believe the proposals we make below meet these goals.   

     3.  Accordingly, we propose to modify our broadband PCS rules as follows:

A.  Partitioning

    Allow broadband PCS licensees in the A, B, D, and E blocks to partition their license area
at any time to entities that meet minimum eligibility requirements.

    Allow entrepreneur block (C and F) broadband PCS licensees to partition their licensed
geographic area at any time to entities that qualify as entrepreneurs and meet minimum eligibility
requirements.  

    Apply our current five-year restriction against complete license transfers to partitioning
by entrepreneur block (C and F) broadband PCS licensees to a non-entrepreneur during the first
five years of the license period; after the five-year period apply unjust enrichment provisions on
a proportional basis.

    Establish license term provisions that permit partitioned license holders (partitionees) to
hold partitioned licenses for the remaining duration of the original licensee's (partitioner) ten-year
license term.

    Establish flexible construction and coverage requirements to ensure expedited access to
broadband PCS service in partitioned areas.

B.  Disaggregation

    Eliminate the January 1, 2000 benchmark and five-year build-out requirement for
disaggregation.

    Require that disaggregation be in blocks no smaller than a 1 MHz block of paired
frequencies to facilitate the administration of licensing.

    Allow broadband PCS licensees in the A, B, D, and E blocks to disaggregate to entities
that meet minimum eligibility requirements.

    Allow entrepreneur block (C and F) broadband PCS licensees to disaggregate to other
eligible entrepreneurs without restriction. 

    Apply our current five-year restriction against complete license transfers to disaggregation
by entrepreneur block (C and F) broadband PCS licensees to a non-entrepreneur during the first
five years of the license period; after the five-year period apply unjust enrichment provisions on
a proportional basis.

    Establish no new construction requirements for disaggregatees already licensed in
geographic markets and flexible construction requirements for disaggregatees that are market
entrants, in order to ensure coverage.  

    Establish license term provisions that permit licensees receiving disaggregated spectrum
to hold their licenses for the duration of the ten-year license term.

    Permit the combination of partitioning and disaggregation.

C.  Related Matters

    Establish an electronic database to make publicly available information about licensed
spectrum, and encourage the development of private clearinghouses and other market solutions
which would enable entities (particularly small businesses) to access information about
opportunities for partitioning and disaggregation of spectrum in particular geographic areas.

                             III.  BACKGROUND

A.  Partitioning

     4.  In the Broadband PCS Memorandum Opinion and Order, the Commission declined
to allow general geographic partitioning, noting that licensees might use partitioning as a means
of circumventing construction requirements.  The Commission observed, however, that a limited
partitioning scheme might facilitate participation by certain groups, including rural telephone
companies (rural telcos) and other designated entities, in the provision of broadband PCS.  The
Commission stated that it would consider the issue of geographic partitioning in a future
proceeding to establish competitive bidding rules for broadband PCS.

     5.  The Commission established geographic partitioning provisions for rural telcos in the
Competitive Bidding Fifth Report and Order.  In taking this action, we determined that
partitioning would satisfy Congress' mandate that the Commission provide an opportunity for
rural telcos to participate at auction and in the provision of broadband PCS.  We also observed
that rural telcos could take advantage of their existing infrastructure to provide broadband PCS
services, thereby speeding service to rural areas.  We therefore decided that rural telcos could
acquire a partitioned license (1) by forming an auction bidding consortium comprised entirely of
rural telcos, and partitioning the license(s) won among consortium members; or (2) through
private negotiation, either before or after an auction.  We required that partitioned areas conform
to established geopolitical boundaries (such as county lines) and that each area include all
portions of the rural telco's wireline service area that lie within the PCS service area.  In addition,
where a rural telco acquires a partitioned license post-auction, our rules require that the
partitioned area be reasonably related to the rural telco's wireline service area.  We further
required that every licensee in each partitioned area be responsible for meeting the build-out
requirements in its area.

     6.  In the Competitive Bidding Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the Commission
requested comment on whether to extend post-auction geographic partitioning of broadband PCS
licenses to women- and minority-owned businesses.  We observed that allowing these entities
to acquire partitioned licenses may facilitate their ability to participate in the provision of
broadband PCS.  Most of the commenters supported our proposal to extend partitioning
provisions to women- and minority-owned businesses.  NPPCA and SBA also encouraged the
Commission to allow small businesses to acquire a partitioned license.  We presently permit
geographic partitioning for MDS, General Wireless Communications Service and 800 MHz
SMR service.  Additionally, we are seeking comment on proposals for partitioning for paging
services, 220 MHz service, 900 MHz SMR service, 800 MHz SMR service, and 38 GHz
fixed point-to-point microwave service.

B.  Disaggregation
     
     7.  Under our current rules, broadband PCS licensees may disaggregate licensed
broadband PCS spectrum after January 1, 2000 if they have met the five-year construction
requirement.  In the Broadband PCS Memorandum Opinion and Order, the Commission
reasoned that this limit on spectrum disaggregation for broadband PCS would allow the PCS
market to take shape and prevent anti-competitive practices with regard to disaggregation.  We
indicated, however, that we would initiate a proceeding at a later date to specify rules for
allowing spectrum disaggregation.  

     8.  Since establishing our policy deferring disaggregation for broadband PCS until the year
2000, several developments have occurred which indicate that a further proceeding to modify the
spectrum disaggregation rules for this service is now warranted.  For instance, we recently
allowed spectrum disaggregation for the in the large low-earth orbiting satellite service.  For
that service,  licensees may resell 1.6 GHz band spectrum rights and 2.065 MHz segments, and
reassign any smaller portion of 1.6 GHz band spectrum.  Moreover, we note that the
Commission has proposed spectrum disaggregation for a variety of services, including commercial
220 MHz, LMDS, 38 GHz, 800 MHz SMR, and paging.  

C.  Limitations on Transfers by Entrepreneur Block Licensees

     9.  We designated frequency blocks C and F as entrepreneurs' blocks to promote 
economic opportunities for a wide variety of applicants including small businesses, rural telcos 
and businesses owned by members of minority groups and women as required by Section
309(j)(4)(C)(ii) of the Communications Act.  We recognized, however, that the congressionally
mandated objective to provide smaller entities an opportunity to obtain licenses will not be served
if winning bidders that benefit from bidding credits and installment payment plans immediately
assign or transfer control of the authorization to entities ineligible for these special provisions. 
Such a practice would unjustly enrich the auction winners and would undermine the congressional
goal of giving designated entities the opportunity to provide spectrum-based services. 
Therefore, we established rules limiting transfers of entrepreneurs' licenses to non-entrepreneurs.

     10.  Our present rules prohibit the assignment or transfer of control of a license for the
C and F blocks unless:  (1) the application for assignment or transfer of control is filed after five
years from the date of the initial license grant; or (2) the assignee or transferee meets the
eligibility criteria set forth in Section 24.709 of the Commission's rules at the time the application
for assignment or transfer of control is filed; or (3) the proposed assignee or transferee holds
other license(s) for frequency Blocks C and F and, at the time of receipt of such license(s), the
proposed assignee or transferee met the eligibility criteria set forth in Section 24.709.  

                              IV.  DISCUSSION

A.  Policy Goals
     
     11.  In this proceeding, we seek to enable a wide variety of broadband PCS applicants,
including small businesses, rural telcos, and businesses owned by members of minority groups
and women, to overcome entry barriers through the creation of smaller, less capital-intensive
licenses that are within the reach of smaller entities.  Moreover, we believe that our proposals,
if adopted, will provide a means for increased access to capital that can be used to construct and
maintain PCS systems.  Our proposals here are part of a multi-proceeding effort to implement
the Communication Act's mandate to identify and eliminate market entry barriers for
entrepreneurs and small businesses in the provision and ownership of telecommunications
services.  In this regard, the Commission also has recently issued a Notice of Inquiry seeking
evidence of current and past discrimination experienced by small businesses and businesses
owned by women and minorities or by individual women and minorities.  Changing our
partitioning and disaggregation rules will also help to ensure that broadband PCS licensees have
the flexibility they need to provide services most valuable to consumers in a competitive market
environment.

     12.  The changes we propose here are consistent with our mandate under Section 309(j)
of the Communications Act to utilize auctions to ensure competitive markets with little or no
opportunity to engage in anti-competitive spectrum warehousing or speculation.  In the words of
one recent commenter on our spectrum allocation policy:  ".  .  .  if an entity has paid fair value
for spectrum at auction there should be few if any restrictions on its ability to sell or lease all
or part of that spectrum."  Our proposals thus take into account our special provisions in our
competitive bidding procedures for entities identified in Section 309(j)(4) of the Communications
Act. 

     13.  Since we adopted our present policies permitting only limited partitioning and
disaggregation by broadband PCS licensees, we have completed auctions and granted licenses for
the A and B 30 MHz blocks.  The C block auction is recently completed and we anticipate
initiating auctions for the D, E, and F blocks in the near future.  The C and F blocks are
designated as entrepreneurs' blocks.  Many of the A and B block licensees have announced
aggressive schedules for system build-out and the initiation of service.  Potential concerns about
slow construction and speculation in licenses without system build-out, while not to be dismissed,
must be viewed in the context of a developing PCS marketplace and the business strategies of
these new licensees.  We believe that our proposals address these potential concerns both in
relation to construction requirements to prevent warehousing and with respect to our special
competitive bidding provisions for entrepreneurs and small businesses.

     14.  We expect that there may be significant benefits in broadening our partitioning
provisions to permit geographic partitioning by A, B, D, and E block licensees to any eligible
party.  Moreover, in light of the fact that many broadband PCS licensees may meet their five-year
construction obligations early, we believe that it may now be appropriate to revisit our ban on
disaggregation before January 1, 2000 as well as the five-year build-out pre-condition. 
Partitioning and disaggregation could allow broadband PCS licensees to tailor their business
strategies and allow them to use the spectrum more efficiently.  In addition, we expect that
partitioning and disaggregation could enable more entities to participate in the provision of
broadband PCS, including small businesses and businesses owned by minorities and women. 
These entities could speed service to unserved communities and bring competition to other areas. 
We also note that partitioning and disaggregation may facilitate the development of so-called
"niche" services which may reflect more efficient use of spectrum and allow market entry by
entities that only have the ability to provide service to a limited population.

     15.  We believe that our proposals will facilitate market entry by parties who may lack
the financial resources for participation in PCS auctions, including small businesses.  In this way,
our proposals are consistent with the mandate of Section 257 to lower entry barriers into the PCS
market for smaller businesses and the directive of Section 309(j) to promote participation in
spectrum-based services by a broad range of diverse entities.  In addition, we believe that the
proposals we make here address a concern we have expressed previously -- lack of access to
capital on the part of entities otherwise qualifying for entrepreneurs' block licenses.  We believe
that these proposals, if implemented, will promote technological advancement, and participation
by diverse entities, as well as facilitate the efficient use of broadband PCS spectrum, increase
competition, and expedite the provision of broadband PCS to areas that may not otherwise receive
broadband PCS or other wireless services in the near term.

B.  Partitioning

     1.  License Eligibility

     16.  For the A, B, D, and E blocks, we propose to relax our broadband PCS geographic
partitioning rules, as discussed below, to allow any party to acquire a license for a partitioned
geographic service area that meets the eligibility requirements to be a broadband PCS licensee. 
In proposing to expand our geographic partitioning provisions to such entities, we remind these
parties of the continuing applicability of our spectrum aggregation rules.  We tentatively
conclude that a more liberal partitioning policy would allow spectrum to be used more efficiently,
speed service to underserved areas, and increase competition.   Commenters are invited to discuss
the merits of our proposal.

     17.  Under our current rules, only rural telcos are eligible to receive a partitioned license. 
As discussed above, we previously determined that our geographic partitioning scheme provides
sufficient means to ensure participation by rural telcos in the provision of broadband PCS.  The
partitioning proposals we make here would apply to rural telcos as well as other parties seeking
partitioned licenses.  We therefore solicit comment on whether liberalizing the geographic
partitioning rules would lessen rural telcos' ability to participate in the provision of broadband
PCS.  We observe that rural telcos have an advantage in constructing a PCS system within their
service areas.  We note that rural telcos can build upon their existing infrastructure to rapidly
deploy PCS, and thus are more likely to be interested in providing PCS to rural areas.  To the
extent that other entities may also be interested in bringing service to underserved rural
communities, we tentatively conclude that our rules should facilitate competition in these areas. 
We solicit comment on these tentative conclusions. 

     2.  Available License Area, Timing, and Financial Obligations

     18.  We propose that any partitioning of broadband licenses be required to be along
county lines in the same manner that rural telcos must partition along county lines under our
current rules.  We tentatively conclude that requiring partitioning of licenses to be along county
lines would reduce the administrative burden on the Commission and minimize our interference
coordination concerns.  For example, the Commission has traditionally established market areas
(including MTAs and BTAs) along county lines and has developed its licensing database to
accommodate those kinds of market designations.  Commenters are invited to address the merits
of our proposal, and whether other geopolitical boundaries may be appropriate.  Where a service
area does not naturally fall along county lines, parties would be free to seek a waiver of our
proposed requirement.  We solicit comment on the appropriate criteria for such waivers.

     a.  Non-entrepreneur block licensees 

     19.  As discussed above, we believe that there may be significant advantages in
broadening our partitioning rules to permit A, B, D, and E block broadband PCS licensees to
partition a portion of their license area to any qualifying entity at any time after receiving a
license.  We therefore propose that all licensees in the A, B, D, and E blocks be permitted at any
time to partition their license area along county lines.  We tentatively conclude that our proposal
would advance the public interest by affording licensees greater flexibility.  Commenters are
invited to discuss whether the Commission should impose any limitations on the size of
geographic area that these non-entrepreneur block licensees would be allowed to partition.

     b.  Licensees with competitive bidding benefits

     20.  Small businesses face certain barriers to entry into the broadband PCS market that
changes in our partitioning rules may address.  Providing licensees with the flexibility to partition
their geographic service areas would create smaller areas that could be licensed to small
businesses, including those entities which may not have had the resources to participate
successfully in spectrum auctions.  We recognize as well that partitioning may provide a funding
source that would enable licensees to build-out their systems and provide the latest in
technological enhancements to the public.  The changes in the partitioning rules we propose here
thus implement in part the requirement of Section 257 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996,
in that we identify the financial factors discussed above as barriers to market entry and propose
to eliminate them through changes in our regulations governing partitioning.  We must remain
vigilant, however, against unjust enrichment as we provide opportunities to a wide array of
entities for the provision of PCS.  We believe that we must ensure that licensees that have
benefitted from special bidding provisions are not permitted to become unjustly enriched by
immediately partitioning a portion of their license area to parties that do not qualify for such
benefits.  

     21.  Frequency blocks C and F are designated as entrepreneurs' blocks to promote 
economic opportunities for a wide variety of applicants including small businesses, rural telcos,
and businesses owned by members of minority groups and women as required by Section
309(j)(4)(C)(ii) of the Communications Act.  We propose that an entrepreneur block licensee
be permitted to partition at any time to other parties that would be eligible for licenses in those
blocks, (i.e., to an entity that either holds other entrepreneur block licenses and thus at the time
of auction satisfied the entrepreneur block criteria, or that satisfies the criteria at the time of
partitioning.)  We believe that allowing entrepreneurs and small businesses to partition and/or
disaggregate their licenses to other qualified entrepreneurs and small businesses will help attain
the Congressional objective of ensuring that entrepreneurs and small businesses have an
opportunity to participate in PCS.

     22.  We seek comment on the treatment of installment plan payments for winning auction
bids owed by partitioning licensees.  For example, should an entrepreneur block licensee who
partitions to another entrepreneur be required to repay, on an accelerated basis, a portion of the
outstanding principal balance owed under an installment payment plan?  We seek comment on
how this should be calculated.  If we decide not to require payment of some amount of the
outstanding principal balance for an entrepreneur block license as a condition for approval of the
partitioning application, what other alternative conditions could we impose to ensure that the
partitioning licensee continues to meet its financial obligation to the United States government?
We seek comment on whether the partitionee should be required to guarantee payment of a
portion of the partitioner's obligation. 

     23.  We tentatively conclude that we should apply some form of unjust enrichment
requirements to a partitioning licensee that has received bidding credits or is paying its winning
auction bid through installment plan payments when the partitionee qualifies as an entrepreneur,
but would receive less favorable installment plan payments.  We seek comment on whether the
unjust enrichment requirements in this case should be on a proportional basis, and how such
payments should be calculated.

     24.  We further propose to apply our current five-year restriction against complete license
transfers to prohibit partitioning and/or disaggregation by an entrepreneur block licensee to a non-
entrepreneur during the first five years of the license period.  This holding requirement was
established to ensure that entrepreneurs did not take advantage of special entrepreneur block
provisions by immediately transferring control of licenses to non-entrepreneurs.  We believe that
applying this holding period to partitioning and disaggregation will ensure our objective that
entrepreneurs and small businesses continue to participate as PCS licensees for substantial periods
of time, and through that participation obtain experience and profits that will enable their long
term participation in communications industries.  

     25.  We tentatively conclude that after the five-year holding period  we should apply
unjust enrichment payments as a condition for approval of an application for a partitioning
transfer of an entrepreneur block license to a non-entrepreneur.  These unjust enrichment
provisions would include accelerated payment of bidding credits, unpaid principal, and accrued
unpaid interest, and would be applied on a proportional basis.  We seek comment on how such
unjust enrichment amounts should be calculated, especially in light of the difficulty of devising
a methodology or formula that will differentiate the relative market value of the opportunities to
provide service to various partitioned areas within a geographic or market area.  We seek
comment on whether we should consider the price paid by the partitionee in determining the
percentage of the outstanding principle balance to be repaid.  

     26.  We seek comment on what the respective obligations of the participants in a
partitioning transfer should be, and whether each party should be required to guarantee all or a
portion of the partitionee's original auctions-related obligation in the event of default or
bankruptcy by any of the parties to the partitioning transfer.  We seek comment on whether the
partitioner (the original licensee) should have a continuing obligation with respect to the entire
initial geographic area.  Alternatively, should the parties have available a choice of options,
ranging, for example, from an accelerated payment based on purchase price to a guarantee for
a larger payment by one party in the event another party defaults?  Parties are invited to comment
on whether the partitioning parties should be able to determine which party has a continuing
obligation with respect to the original licensed area.

     27.  We tentatively conclude that our proposals to permit partitioning in the manner
described above would allow broadband PCS spectrum to be used most efficiently, speed service
to unserved or underserved areas, and facilitate competition.  Our proposal to permit partitioning
by entrepreneur block licensees, including small businesses, to similarly qualified parties also
would ensure that these entities retain a significant presence in the market, consistent with our
objectives in establishing eligibility for these blocks.  Moreover, we tentatively conclude that
our proposal to relax the partitioning provisions may help small business licensees compete more
effectively in the areas they retain and assist in the elimination of entry barriers to the PCS
market.  We observe, for example, that these entities may apply any revenues gained from
partitioning towards the cost of constructing their systems and marketing their service.  We solicit
comment on this analysis of the intended effects of our proposals.

     3.  License Term

     28.  Under our rules, a broadband PCS licensee is authorized to provide service for ten
years from the date of initial license grant.  A licensee may submit an application to renew its
license for an additional license term, and is afforded a renewal expectancy if it can demonstrate
that it has provided "substantial" service during its past license term and has substantially
complied with applicable Commission rules, policies, and the Communications Act. 
"Substantial" service has been defined as service which is "sound, favorable, and substantially
above a level of mediocre service which might just minimally warrant renewal."

     29.  We propose that a partitionee be authorized to hold its license for the remainder of
the partitioner's original ten-year license term.  We tentatively conclude that this approach is
appropriate because a licensee, through partitioning, should not be able to confer greater rights
than it was awarded under the terms of its license grant.  Moreover, we tentatively conclude that
this approach would be the simplest to administer.  We also observe that this approach is similar
to the partitioning provisions we recently adopted for MDS as well as the existing broadband
PCS partitioning provisions for rural telcos.  In addition, this proposal  is consistent with other
licensing rules applicable to commercial mobile radio services (CMRS) for the license term of
a transferee or assignee of a license for a complete service area for paging, narrowband PCS, and
broadband PCS.  We solicit comment on this tentative conclusion. 

     30.  We also propose that a partitionee be afforded the same renewal expectancy as an
MTA or BTA licensee.  Specifically, a partitionee would be granted a preference at a
comparative renewal proceeding if it can demonstrate that it has provided "substantial" service
during its past license term and has substantially complied with applicable Commission rules,
policies and the Communications Act.  We observe that this approach is consistent with our
proposed construction requirements, discussed below.  We invite comment on this proposal.

     4.  Construction Requirements

     31.  In the Broadband PCS Memorandum Opinion and Order, we found that broadband
PCS would likely be a highly competitive service and that licensees would have incentives to
construct facilities to meet the service demands in their licensed areas.  Nevertheless, we
imposed minimum construction requirements to expedite service to the public and promote
efficient use of the spectrum.  Specifically, the Commission required 30 MHz broadband PCS
licensees to construct facilities that provide coverage to one-third of the population of their
service area within five years of the initial license grant and two-thirds of the population within
ten years.  Ten MHz licensees are required to provide coverage to one-fourth of the service
area's population within five years or, alternatively, they may submit a showing to the
Commission demonstrating that they are providing "substantial" service.  

     32.  As discussed above, when we originally declined to allow general partitioning by
broadband PCS licensees, we were concerned that licensees might use partitioning as a means
to circumvent our construction requirements.  We tentatively conclude that to avoid this result
both the partitioner and partitionee should be subject to coverage requirements that ensure that
both portions of a partitioned licensing area will receive service.  Our proposal would facilitate
partitioning by offering a choice between two different build-out options, which could be
negotiated between the partitioner and partitionee.  Applicants would then select in their
assignment and transfer applications the construction option they would be obligated to meet.
     
     33.  Under the first option, a partitionee would be obligated to satisfy the same
construction requirements as the original licensee within its partitioned area, regardless of when
it acquired the partitioned license.  A partitionee of a 30 MHz broadband PCS license, for
example, would be obligated to provide service to at least one-third of the population in its
partitioned license area within five years of the underlying license term and two-thirds of the
population in its partitioned license area by the end of the ten-year license term.  A partitionee
of a 10 MHz broadband PCS license would have to provide service to at least one-quarter of the
population in its partitioned licensed area or make a showing of substantial service at the five-
year benchmark.  We observe that this approach is consistent with our present construction
requirements for rural telcos.  Commenters are invited to discuss the merits of this option.  

     34.  As a second option, we propose more modest build-out requirements for a partitioned
area where the original licensee has met its five-year build-out requirements and certifies that it
will meet the ten-year coverage requirements for its entire license area.  Because the original
licensee maintains its original coverage commitment with respect to the entire licensing area
under this option, we believe the partitionee should be subject to a relaxed build-out requirement. 
Specifically, we propose that partitionees must only satisfy the substantial service requirement
for renewal expectancy for its partitioned area by the end of the original ten-year license term. 
For example: an A Block licensee who meets its five-year build-out requirements within three
years after receiving its license, may, in its partitioning application, certify that it will meet the
ten-year coverage requirement for its original license.  In this scenario, the partitionee would only
be required to meet the substantial service requirement for its partitioned area at the end of the
A Block licensee's original ten-year license term.

     35.  We tentatively conclude that establishing flexible build-out requirements would
encourage partitioning to entities that have a sincere interest in providing broadband PCS and
would thereby expedite the provision of service to areas that otherwise may not receive it as
quickly.  We also observe that this option may facilitate partitioning agreements, especially in
the latter portion of a license term, by acknowledging licensees' efforts to bring broadband PCS
service to their licensed areas.  We solicit comment on this build-out proposal.  Commenters are
also invited to address what build-out requirements should apply where a licensee partitions a
portion of its license area after the initial ten-year license term has expired.

B.  Disaggregation 

     1.  Timing of Disaggregation

     36.  Section 24.229(d) permits a broadband PCS licensee who has met the five-year
construction requirement to assign portions of its licensed PCS spectrum after January 1, 2000. 
In the Broadband PCS Memorandum Opinion and Order, we stated that allowing immediate
disaggregation of spectrum before that time may impede competition in the provision of
broadband PCS.  We also concluded that we should give the market an opportunity to develop
before permitting licensees to disaggregate a portion of their spectrum.

     37.  We now believe that these decisions may no longer be warranted.  To the extent that
disaggregation would enable other entities to provide broadband PCS service within geographic
market areas, we tentatively conclude that our rules should facilitate rather than impede entry by
new competitors.  In addition, we tentatively conclude that our current prohibitions on
disaggregation may constitute a barrier to market entry for small businesses which may lack the
resources to participate successfully in auctions for 30 MHz and 10 MHz broadband PCS
spectrum blocks.  In furtherance of the mandate prescribed by Section 257 of the
Telecommunications Act of 1996, we propose to eliminate such market entry barriers by making
changes in our disaggregation rules as discussed below.  We seek comment on these tentative
conclusions. 

     38.  We propose to allow spectrum disaggregation prior to January 1, 2000, and to
eliminate the condition that the licensee must satisfy our five-year build-out requirements before
disaggregating.  We invite comment on whether to retain our five-year build-out requirement
before allowing disaggregation.  Commenters should discuss whether our goals of elimination of
market entry barriers, efficient spectrum use, expedited access to broadband PCS service, and
competition would be better served by eliminating this restriction.  Specifically, we propose to
allow non-entrepreneurs to disaggregate to other qualified entities at any time, and to allow
entrepreneurs to disaggregate to other qualified entrepreneurs at any time, but entrepreneurs
would be restricted from  disaggregating spectrum to non-entrepreneurs until after the five-year
holding period.  Commenters should discuss whether any alternate restrictions on allowing
disaggregation may be appropriate. 

     2.  Amount of Spectrum to Disaggregate

     39.  In our Broadband PCS Memorandum Opinion and Order, we established six
frequency blocks of spectrum for licensed broadband PCS.  Three of the blocks (A, B, and C)
each have 30 MHz of spectrum, while the remaining blocks (D, E, and F) have 10 MHz of
spectrum each.  We determined that our broadband PCS spectrum allocation plan would
facilitate the rapid deployment of broadband PCS and enable broadband PCS licensees to
compete fully with other commercial mobile radio services.  We determined that 30 MHz blocks
of spectrum would facilitate competition and the rapid development and implementation of the
fullest range of PCS services and ensure that PCS is more fully competitive with other mobile
radio services.  In addition, we observed that 10 MHz licensees may be able to provide services
ranging from specialized, "niche" applications to services comparable to those now provided by
cellular systems, through the use of advanced digital techniques, such as Code Division Multiple
Access (CDMA) and Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), and micro-cellular technology. 
We also concluded that 10 MHz blocks, on their own and in combination with other 10 and 30
MHz blocks, may support a variety of PCS services and could allow cellular licensees, who have
limited eligibility for PCS participation within their cellular service areas, to obtain a PCS license
and have the ability to possibly augment their cellular service in this manner.

     40.  Personal communications requirements are changing rapidly as our society becomes
more mobile and the demand for near instantaneous communications and universal access
increases.  We believe that PCS will provide competition to existing mobile services, including
cellular, paging and SMR.  As originally envisioned, PCS services and devices would include
advanced forms of cellular telephone service, advanced digital cordless telephone service, portable
facsimile services, wireless PBX services, and wireless local area network (LAN) services, among
others.  

     41.  Because our current rules simply defer any disaggregation to the year 2000 at the
earliest, they do not address the issue of the amount of spectrum which a licensee may
disaggregate.  We seek comment on and proposals for the amount of spectrum that a licensee
should be required to retain if we allow disaggregation on a more expedited basis.  We seek
comment generally concerning whether some restriction or limit should be placed on the amount
of spectrum a licensee may disaggregate or the timing of such disaggregation.

     42.  We propose that licensees disaggregate frequencies in accordance with the pairings
specified in our rules.  We also tentatively conclude that some grouping of frequency pairs is
preferable for administrative purposes, otherwise the database necessary to track authorizations
could become too cumbersome and complex and processing could be delayed or prone to error. 
We tentatively conclude that for these purposes, we will not permit disaggregation for broadband
PCS in blocks smaller than a 1 MHz block of paired frequencies, thus requiring the
disaggregating licensee to retain a minimum of 1 MHz.  We seek comment on this tentative
conclusion.  We request that commenters suggesting alternative approaches provide technical
justifications and other relevant support in responding to this issue. 

     43.  We seek comment on whether we should require broadband PCS licensees to be
licensed for more than a minimum of 1 MHz to provide broadband PCS services as originally
envisioned in the Broadband PCS Second Report and Order.  We note that the description of
potential broadband PCS services differentiates broadband from narrowband services and served
in part as a justification for the spectrum size of the broadband PCS license blocks.  We seek
comment on whether and how we should clarify or modify our description of broadband PCS for
purposes of defining a minimum amount of spectrum to provide such services.  We also request
comment on what amount is the minimum amount of spectrum which a disaggregatee could
utilize for the provision of broadband type services.  We seek comment generally on the
relevance of the distinction between broadband and narrowband for purposes of our
disaggregation rules.  

     44.  We believe that our rules relating to spectrum caps may have some impact on our
decision making on disaggregation.  Our present spectrum cap rules limit PCS licensees to 45
MHz of aggregated spectrum in PCS, cellular, or SMR.  The 45 MHz cap was meant as a
minimally intrusive means of ensuring that the mobile communications marketplace remains
competitive and retains incentives for efficiency and innovation.

     45.  We tentatively conclude that elimination of our current prohibitions on broadband
PCS disaggregation would be consistent with our recent elimination of the cellular/PCS cross-
ownership rule and the 40 MHz PCS spectrum cap and retention of 45 MHz cap, because such
actions would facilitate market transfers of spectrum among cellular and PCS licensees while
maintaining a provision to ensure a diversity of service providers.  We request comment on this
tentative conclusion and generally on the impact of the present 45 MHz spectrum cap upon our
proposals.
     
     3.  Matters Relating to Entrepreneur Block Licensees
     
     46.  In light of our discussion above about the benefits that licensee flexibility to
disaggregate can provide, we now propose to allow all entrepreneur block licensees to
disaggregate to similarly qualifying parties at any time without restriction, and to parties not
eligible for entrepreneur block licenses after a five-year holding period.  We tentatively conclude
that if we permit an entrepreneur block licensee to disaggregate to a non-entrepreneur entity after
the five-year holding period, the disaggregating entrepreneur block licensee will be required to
repay the unjust enrichment provisions on a proportional basis.  These unjust enrichment
provisions would include accelerated payment of bidding credits, unpaid principal, and accrued
unpaid interest, and would be applied on a proportional basis.  We seek comment on how such
unjust enrichment amounts should be calculated.  We seek comment on whether we should
consider the price paid by the disaggregating party in determining the percentage of the
outstanding principle balance to be repaid.  

     47.  We seek comment on what the respective obligations of the participants in a
disaggregation transfer should be, and whether each party should be required to guarantee all or
a portion of the disaggregatee's original auctions-related obligation in the event of default or
bankruptcy by any of the parties to the disaggregation transfer.  We seek comment on whether
the disaggregator (the original licensee) should have a continuing obligation with respect to the
entire initial license.  Alternatively, should the parties have available a choice of options, ranging,
for example, from an accelerated payment based on purchase price to a guarantee for a larger
payment by one party in the event another party defaults?  Parties are invited to comment on
whether the disaggregating parties should be able to determine which party has a continuing
obligation with respect to the original licensed area.

     48.  We tentatively conclude that if we permit an entrepreneur block licensee to
disaggregate to an entrepreneur that would not qualify for the same level of benefits as the
disaggregating licensee, the disaggregating entrepreneur block licensee will be required to repay
a portion of the unjust enrichment provisions as they apply to a full assignment of a license.  We
seek comment on whether this should be a proportional amount of its bidding credits, unpaid
principal, and accrued unpaid interest to the U.S. Treasury, and how the amounts should be
calculated.  Finally, we seek comment on what provisions, if any, we should adopt to address the
situation of an entrepreneur block licensee's disaggregation followed by default in payment of a
winning bid at auction.

     49.  We seek comment on whether we should have different requirements for entrepreneur
block licensees and for non-entrepreneur block licensees regarding the amounts of spectrum
which a licensee must retain or may disaggregate, and on what those requirements should be.  

     4.  Construction Requirements
     
     50.  As discussed above, we require broadband PCS licensees to satisfy certain
construction requirements.  Specifically, our rules require 30 MHz broadband PCS licensees to
construct facilities that provide coverage to one-third of the population of their service area within
five years of the initial license grant and two-thirds of the population within ten years.  Ten
MHz licensees are required to construct facilities that provide coverage to one-fourth of the
service area's population within five years or, alternatively, they may submit a showing to the
Commission demonstrating that they are providing "substantial" service.
     
     51.  To address the concerns raised in the Broadband PCS Memorandum Opinion and
Order about anti-competitive incentives to disaggregate and engage in spectrum warehousing, we
propose two construction build-out options to apply to entities receiving disaggregated spectrum
that do not already possess a broadband PCS license in the same geographic service area.  Such
applicants seeking to receive disaggregated spectrum would select the construction option for
which they would be obligated to meet in their assignment and transfer applications.  As
discussed below, we tentatively conclude that our proposal would prevent licensees from
warehousing spectrum and would enable new entrants to provide service.   

     52.  Similar to our partitioning proposal, under the first option, a disaggregatee entering
the geographic market would be obligated to satisfy the same construction requirements as the
licensee, regardless of when it acquired the disaggregated spectrum.  For example, an entity that
acquires spectrum from a 30 MHz broadband PCS licensee (an A, B, or C block licensee) would
be obligated to provide service to at least one-third of the population in the MTA or BTA license
area within five years of the underlying license term and two-thirds of the population in the
license area by the end of the ten-year license term.  An entity that acquires spectrum from a 10
MHz broadband PCS licensee (a D, E, or F block licensee) would have to provide adequate
service to at least one-quarter of the population in the BTA license area or make a showing of
substantial service at the five-year benchmark.  We tentatively conclude that this approach would
prevent spectrum warehousing and ensure expedited access to broadband PCS services. 
Commenters are invited to discuss the merits of this option.  

     53.  As a second option, we propose a modified build-out requirement after the
disaggregating licensee has met its five-year build-out requirement and certifies that it will meet
the ten-year construction requirement by the end of its license term.  Specifically, we propose that
a disaggregatee must only satisfy our five-year build-out requirements for the license area by the
end of the original ten-year license term.  We tentatively conclude that this build-out option will
facilitate the rapid introduction of broadband PCS service and increase spectrum efficiency.  We
seek comment on this approach.  Commenters are also invited to address whether these build-out
requirements should apply where a licensee disaggregates a portion of its spectrum after the
initial ten-year license term has expired.

     54.  We propose to require, as a pre-condition for approving a proposed disaggregation,
certifications from both the disaggregator and the disaggregatee that the time remaining before
the ten-year construction benchmarks is sufficient for the disaggregator and disaggregatee to meet
the pertinent construction benchmark for their respective licenses.  This proposal would ensure
against delay in the build-out of PCS, and place all parties on notice that the construction
requirements must be considered during the negotiations.  In addition, disaggregatees must file
maps and other supporting documents showing compliance with the construction requirements
within the appropriate five-year and ten-year bench marks of the date of their initial licenses.
     
     55.  If a licensee fails to meet the construction requirements, we propose that the license
of the disaggregator or disaggregatee revert back to the Commission without further action by
the Commission.  This will ensure timely provision of service.  In light of the fact that the
disaggregator and disaggregatee are each licensees, their prospective construction requirements
are independent from each other and failure to satisfy one construction requirement will not affect
the renewal of the other.

     56.  For disaggregatees already possessing a broadband PCS license in a geographic
service area, we propose no new construction requirements, on the premise that these licensees
are already subject to coverage requirements under their existing licenses. We seek comment on
this proposal. We seek comment on the construction requirements, if any, that should apply to
other CMRS licensees receiving disaggregated broadband PCS spectrum, how we should
recognize the different licensing schemes and service areas in applying such requirements, and
whether some specified amount of disaggregated spectrum should serve as a threshold to trigger
coverage requirements.  

     5.  License Term

     57.  We propose a similar license term for disaggregation as we have for partitioning, i.e.,
that a disaggregatee would be authorized to hold its license for the disaggregated spectrum for
the remainder of the disaggregator's original ten-year license term.  As with partitioning, we
believe this approach is appropriate because a licensee, through disaggregation, should not be able
to bestow greater rights than it was awarded under the terms of its license grant.  We seek
comment, however, on whether administrative efficiency and convenience for licensees support
a limited exception to this general rule.  Specifically, we seek comment on whether a licensee
acquiring spectrum in the geographic area in which it is an existing broadband PCS licensee
should be allowed to apply its original license term to the newly-acquired spectrum.  For
example, should an F Block licensee obtaining spectrum from the A Block licensee in the same
market retain the F Block license term?  In addition, we propose that a disaggregatee be afforded
the same renewal rights as an MTA or BTA licensee.  A disaggregatee would be granted a
preference at a comparative renewal proceeding if it can demonstrate that it has provided
"substantial" service during its past license term and has substantially complied with applicable
Commission rules, policies, and the Communications Act.  We invite comment on this proposal,
and we solicit comment on how to apply this renewal standard in cases where a disaggregatee
has acquired the disaggregated license near the end of the original license term.

                            V.  RELATED MATTERS

A.  Combination of Partitioning and Disaggregation
     
     58.  Should we adopt the proposals set forth above for partitioning and disaggregation,
broadband PCS licensees and other qualifying entities may desire to use in combination our
partitioning and disaggregation rules to enter or increase their presence in a market or to expand
or enhance service options.  Our goal is to provide for a robust PCS service that is fully
competitive and spectrum efficient in order to ensure quality service to the public.  We believe
that the proposals for partitioning and disaggregation we make here are consistent with those
goals.

     59.  We thus tentatively conclude that we should permit combinations of partitioning and
disaggregation, subject to the rules we have proposed for each.  We seek comment on this
proposed approach.  Specifically, we invite comment on whether the benefits of allowing
licensees to combine disaggregation and partitioning as described above outweigh factors
supporting continuation of our current rules.  Finally, in those situations where the combination
of partitioning and disaggregation is allowed under our proposed rules, we propose to implement
the rules proposed for partitioning in the event there is a conflict in the application of our rules. 
We seek comment on where such conflicts might arise and generally on our overall approach to
the combination of partitioning and disaggregation addressed herein.

B.  Licensing

     60.  For ease of administration and to lessen the burden on applicants by adopting new
filing requirements, we propose to follow existing partial assignment procedures for broadband
PCS licenses in reviewing requests for geographic partitioning, disaggregation, or a combination
of both.  Thus, the licensee must file an FCC Form 490 that is signed by both the licensee and
qualifying entity.  The qualifying entity would also file an FCC Form 430 unless a current FCC
Form 430 is already on file with the Commission.  An FCC Form 600 would be filed by the
qualifying entity to receive authorization to operate in the market area which is being partitioned
or to modify an existing station of the qualifying entity to include the new/additional market area
being partitioned.  We seek comment on our proposed licensing rules.

     61.  Any requests for a partitioned license or disaggregated spectrum would contain the
FCC Forms 490, 430, and 600 and be filed as one package under cover of the FCC Form 490. 
Parties are invited to comment on whether any additional procedures should be required.  A
broadband PCS disaggregatee must file FCC Form 430 qualifying it as a common carrier unless
a current FCC Form 430 is already on file with the Commission.  An FCC Form 600 should be
filed by the disaggregatee to receive authorization to operate in the market area which is covered
by the disaggregated spectrum or to modify an existing station of the disaggregatee to include
the new/additional spectrum being disaggregated.  Any requests for a partitioned license or
disaggregated spectrum should contain the FCC Forms 490, 430, and 600 as stated and be filed
as one package under cover of the FCC Form 490.  Parties are invited to comment whether any
additional procedures should be required.

C.  Technical and Microwave Relocation Rules

     62.  In the Broadband PCS Second Report and Order, the Commission adopted minimal
technical standards to allow PCS to develop in the most rapid, economically feasible and diverse
manner.  Specific technical standards were prescribed to the extent necessary to avoid harmful
interference.  We also encouraged industry groups to consider ways of ensuring that PCS users,
service providers, and equipment manufacturers could incorporate roaming, interoperability and
other important features in the most efficient and least costly manner.

     63.  We tentatively conclude that our current technical rules with respect to service area
boundary limits and protections, which provide for coordination and negotiation among licensees,
should be maintained and applied to partitioned license areas, which, as discussed above, would
divide along geopolitical boundaries.  We seek comment on this tentative conclusion.  We seek
comment on whether any modifications to our technical rules are needed to accommodate our
partitioning and disaggregation proposals.  Specifically, we seek comment on what changes, if
any, are needed in our interference and other operational rules?  

     64.  We recently adopted a plan for the sharing of costs for relocating fixed microwave
facilities operating in the 2 GHz band allocated to broadband PCS.  Under this plan, later
entrant PCS licensees will be required to pay reimbursement obligations when they have
benefitted from the spectrum-clearing efforts of another party, according to a cost-sharing formula
that takes into account the amounts paid to relocate a particular microwave link and the number
of PCS licensees that would have interfered with the link.  We tentatively conclude that a new
entrant PCS licensee who gains its license through partitioning or disaggregation should be
treated as any other subsequent PCS licensee for purposes of the relocation cost-sharing plan,
including eligibility for installment plan payments if the transferee would be eligible for an
installment plan equivalent to that enjoyed by the transferring licensee, unless the reimbursement
obligations to which they would be subject have already been paid by the transferring licensee. 
We seek comment on this approach.

D.  Clearinghouse for Spectrum

     65.  From time to time, the Commission receives requests for limited or discrete amounts
of spectrum, sometimes for small geographic areas.  We seek comment on whether establishing
an electronic database to make more readily accessible the information in the Commission's
possession about licensed PCS spectrum would lower market entry barriers, consistent with the
mandate of Section 257 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, or otherwise be in the public
interest.  We request comment on how we can encourage the creation of private information
clearinghouses on available spectrum, and what procedures could be utilized to assist small
businesses in obtaining available licenses or spectrum from licensees to meet very limited or
defined telecommunications needs.  We also seek comment on how the Commission can promote
information clearinghouses or other market solutions so that the public can be informed about
spectrum availability in particular geographic areas or excess or available spectrum that could be
disaggregated in minimum amounts.

                              VI.  CONCLUSION

     66.  We believe that our partitioning and disaggregation proposals are consistent with a
pro-competitive deregulatory national policy framework and will promote the rapid creation of
a competitive market to deliver broadband PCS services to the largest number of consumers. 
These proposals are designed to meet the Congressional objectives of opening
telecommunications markets to competition, providing advanced technologies and services
efficiently and quickly, and identifying and eliminating market entry barriers for entrepreneurs
and other small businesses in the provision and ownership of telecommunications services.

                  INITIAL REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ANALYSIS
                        Regulatory Flexibility Act
     
     As required by Section 603 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Commission has
prepared an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) of the expected impact on small
entities of the policies and rules proposed in this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.  Written public
comments are requested on the IRFA.  Comments must be identified as responses to the IRFA
and must be filed by the deadlines for comments on the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking provided
above in section VII(C).

     Reason for Action:  This rulemaking proceeding was initiated to secure comment on
proposals to modify our broadband PCS rules to permit partitioning and disaggregation for all
Part 24 licensees.  The proposals advanced in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking are also
designed to implement Congress' goal of giving small businesses the opportunity to participate
in the provision of spectrum-based services in accordance with 47 U.S.C. 
 309(j)(4)(D).

     Objectives:  The Commission proposes changes to its rules for broadband PCS that are
intended to facilitate the efficient use of broadband PCS spectrum, increase competition, and
expedite the provision of broadband PCS service to areas that may not otherwise receive
broadband PCS or other wireless services in the near term.  These proposals seek to increase the
level of small business participation in the provision of broadband PCS.  The Commission
proposes to allow broadband PCS licensees in the non-entrepreneurs' blocks to partition any
portion of their geographic license area to entities that are eligible to be broadband PCS licensees. 
The Commission further proposes to allow entrepreneurs' block licensees to partition any portion
of their licensed geographic area to entities that qualify as entrepreneurs and are otherwise
eligible to be broadband PCS licensees.  Additionally, the Commission proposes to eliminate the
January 1, 2000 benchmark for disaggregation, and allow disaggregation any time after the
broadband PCS licensee meets the five-year build-out requirement.  Specifically, the Commission
proposes to allow broadband PCS licensees in the non-entrepreneurs' blocks to disaggregate
spectrum to entities that are eligible to be broadband PCS licensees.  The Commission proposes
to allow entrepreneurs' block licensees to disaggregate to another entrepreneur, otherwise
qualified to be a broadband PCS licensee. Additionally, the Commission proposes to establish
license terms that permit partitionees to hold partitioned licenses and disaggregatees to hold
disaggregated spectrum for the remaining duration of the original ten-year license term.  The
Commission also proposes to establish construction requirements to ensure expedient access to
broadband PCS service in partitioned areas to ensure coverage and increase spectrum efficiency. 
Finally, the Commission proposes to allow licensees to combine partitioning and disaggregation
under limited circumstances.

     Legal Basis:  The proposed action is authorized under Sections 4(i), 257, 303(r) and
309(j) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C.  154(i), 257, 303(r) and
309(j), as amended.

     Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other Compliance Requirements:  The proposals
under consideration in this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking include the possibility of imposing
reporting and recordkeeping requirements for small businesses seeking licenses through the
proposed partitioning and disaggregation rules.  The information requirements would be used to
determine if the licensee is a qualifying entity to obtain a partitioned license or disaggregated
spectrum.  This information will be a one-time filing by any applicant requesting such a license. 
The information will be submitted on the FCC Forms 490 (or 430 and/or 600 filed as one
package under cover of the Form 490) which are currently in use and have already received OMB
clearance.  We estimate that the average burden on the applicant is three hours for the
information necessary to complete these forms.  We estimate that 75 percent of the respondents
(which may include small businesses) will contract out the burden of responding.  We estimate
that it will take approximately 30 minutes to coordinate information with those contractors.  The
remaining 25 percent of respondents (which may include small businesses) are estimated to
employ in-house staff to provide the information.  Applicants (including small businesses) filing
the package under cover of FCC Form 490 electronically will incur a $2.30 per minute on-line
charge.  On-line time would amount to no more than 30 minutes.  We estimate that 75 percent
of the applicants may file electronically.  We estimate that applicants contracting out the
information would use an attorney or engineer (average of $200 per hour) to prepare the
information.

     Federal Rules Which Overlap, Duplicate or Conflict With These Rules:
None.

     Description, Potential Impact, and Number of Small Entities Involved:  The rule
changes proposed in this proceeding will affect all small businesses which avail themselves of
these rule changes, including small businesses currently holding broadband PCS licenses who
choose to partition and/or disaggregate, and small businesses who may acquire licenses through
partitioning and/or disaggregation.  The Commission is required to estimate in its Final
Regulatory Flexibility Analysis the number of small entities to which a rule will apply, provide
a description of such entities, and assess the impact of the rule on such entities.  To assist the
Commission in this analysis, commenters are requested to provide information regarding how
many total broadband PCS entities, existing and potential, would be affected by the proposed
rules in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.  In particular, we seek estimates of how many
broadband PCS entities, existing and potential, will be considered small businesses.  "Small
business" is defined as a firm that has revenues of less than $40 million in each of the last three
calendar years.  This definition was used in the PCS C-Block auction and approved by the Small
Business Administration.  We seek comment as to whether this definition is appropriate in this
context.  Additionally, we request each commenter to identify whether it is a small business
under this definition.  If the commenter is a subsidiary of another entity, this information should
be provided for both the subsidiary and the parent corporation or entity. 

     The broadband PCS spectrum is divided into six frequency blocks designated A through
F.  The Commission has auctioned broadband PCS licenses in blocks A, B, and C.  We do not
have sufficient information to determine whether any small businesses within the SBA-approved
definition bid successfully for licenses A or B block auctions.  There were 89 winning bidders
that qualified as small businesses in the C block PCS auctions.  Based on this information, we
conclude that the number of broadband PCS licensees affected by the rules proposed in this
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking includes the 89 winning bidders that qualified as small entities
in the block C broadband PCS auction.

     We estimate up to 10,370 PCS licensees or potential licensees could take the opportunity
to partition and/or disaggregate a license or obtain a license through partitioning and/or
disaggregation.  This estimate is based on the total number broadband PCS licenses auctioned
and subject to auction, 2,074, and our estimate that each license would probably not be
partitioned and/or disaggregated to more than five parties.  We note that the A and B blocks each
consist of 51 MTA licenses (a total of 102 licenses) and the C, D, E, and F blocks each consist
of 493 BTA licenses (a total of 1,972 licenses).  Currently the C and F block licensees and
potential licensees (holding a total of 986 licenses) must be small businesses or entrepreneurs
with average gross revenues over the past three years of less than $125 million.  Under the
proposed rules they will be permitted to partition and/or disaggregate to other qualified
entrepreneurs.  The A, B, D, and E block licensees and potential licensees (holding a total of
1,088 licenses) will also be permitted under the proposed rules to partition and/or disaggregate
to small businesses. 

     At present, there have been no auctions held for the D, E, and F blocks of broadband PCS
spectrum.  The Commission anticipates a total of 1,479 licenses will be awarded in the D, E, and
F block PCS auctions, which are scheduled to begin on August 26, 1996.  Eligibility for the F
block licenses is limited to entrepreneurs with average gross revenues of less than $125 million. 
However, there is no basis upon which to estimate the number of licenses that will be awarded
to small businesses, nor is there a basis for an estimate as to how many small businesses will win
D or E block licenses.  Given the fact that nearly all radiotelephone companies have fewer than
1,000 employees, and that no reliable estimate of the number of D, E, and F block licensees can
be made, we assume, for purposes of this IRFA that all of the licenses will be awarded to small
businesses.  We believe that it is possible that a significant number of the up to 10,370 PCS
licensees or potential licensees who could take the opportunity to partition and/or disaggregate
a license or who could obtain a license through partitioning and/or disaggregation will be small
businesses.

     Any Significant Alternatives Minimizing the Impact on Small Entities Consistent with
the Stated Objectives:  The proposals advanced in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking are
designed to implement Congress' goal of giving small businesses, as well as other entities, the
opportunity to participate in the provision of spectrum-based services.  The impact on small
entities in the proposals in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking is the opportunity to enter the
Broadband PCS market through the partitioning and disaggregation proposals herein.  

     The rule changes proposed in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking by the Commission are
consistent with the Communication Act's mandate to identify and eliminate market entry barriers
for entrepreneurs and small businesses in the provision and ownership of telecommunications
services, and the mandate under Section 309(j) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended,
to utilize auctions to ensure that small, minority and women-owned businesses and rural
telephone companies have an opportunity to participate in the provision of spectrum-based
services.  The Commission's proposals in this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, if implemented,
will facilitate market entry by parties who may lack the financial resources for participation in
PCS auctions, including small businesses.  These proposals, if implemented, will promote
technological advancement and participation by diverse entities, as well as facilitate the efficient
use of broadband PCS spectrum.  The alternative to the Commission's proposal to allow
geographic partitioning would be to maintain the status quo and only permit rural telephone
companies to utilize partitioning through forming an auction bidding consortium comprised
entirely of rural telephone companies or through private negotiation post-auction.  Limiting
geographic partitioning to rural telephone companies would not permit other small businesses to
obtain partitioned licenses or to partition to other parties, and thus would not promote the
participation of small businesses in the provision of PCS.  The Commission also noted that the
proposed partitioning policy would allow spectrum to be used more efficiently, speed service to
underserved areas, and increase competition.

     In this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the Commission observed that initially general
partitioning by broadband PCS licensees was not permitted because of the concern that licensees
might use partitioning as a means to circumvent construction requirements.  The Commission
tentatively concludes that both the partitioner and partitionee should be subject to coverage
requirements that ensure that both portions of a partitioned licensing area will receive service. 
The Commission proposes facilitating partitioning by offering a choice between two different
build-out options, which could be negotiated between the partitioner and partitionee.  The first
option proposed by the Commission would require a partitionee to satisfy the same construction
requirements as the original licensee within its partitioned area, regardless of when it acquired
the partitioned license.  This approach is consistent with the present construction requirements
for rural telephone companies.   The second option proposed by the Commission would apply
where the original licensee has met its five-year build-out requirements and certifies that it will
meet the ten-year coverage requirements for its entire license area.  Specifically, the Commission
proposes that partitionees must only satisfy the substantial service requirement for renewal
expectancy for its partitioned area by the end of the original ten-year license term.  The
Commission tentatively concludes that these proposed flexible build-out requirements, if adopted,
will encourage partitioning to entities that have a sincere interest in providing broadband PCS
and will thereby expedite the provision of service to areas that otherwise may not receive it as
quickly. 

     The Commission considered the fact that many broadband PCS licensees may meet their
five-year build-out construction obligation early, and therefore proposes revisiting the current
prohibition on disaggregation.  The Commission considered the alternative, requiring PCS
licensees to wait until January 1, 2000 before disaggregating, and noted that this would not
permit small businesses to disaggregate or obtain disaggregated spectrum and therefore, would
not promote an efficient use of spectrum. 

     The Commission is proposing to allow partitioning and/or disaggregation by entrepreneurs
only to other qualified entrepreneurs for five years, to ensure the objective that entrepreneurs and
small businesses continue to participate as PCS licensees for substantial periods of time, and
through that participation obtain experience and profits that will enable their long term
participation in communications industries.  The Commission is proposing to apply proportional
unjust enrichment provisions for partitioning and disaggregation by entrepreneurs to non-
entrepreneurs after the five-year period.  The alternative to this proposal,  would be to either
prohibit partitioning by entrepreneurs or to allow entrepreneurs who have benefitted from special
bidding provisions to become unjustly enriched by immediately partitioning a portion of their
license area to parties that do not qualify for such benefits.  The Commission also noted that
allowing partitioning and/or disaggregation by entrepreneurs only to other qualified entrepreneurs
for five years is consistent with the Commission's rule allowing license transfers by entrepreneurs
only to other entrepreneurs in the first five years of the license period.   

     The Commission believes that allowing entrepreneurs and small businesses to partition
and/or disaggregate their licenses to other qualified entrepreneurs and small businesses, and
allowing all non-entrepreneurs to partition and/or disaggregate to any qualified party (including
small businesses) will help attain the Congressional objective of ensuring that small businesses
have an opportunity to participate in the provision of broadband PCS.  These proposals will
enable a wide variety of applicants, including small businesses, to overcome entry barriers in the
provision and ownership of telecommunications services.  

     This Notice of Proposed Rulemaking solicits comment on a variety of alternatives
discussed herein.  Any significant alternatives presented in the comments will be considered. 

SEPARATE STATEMENT 
                                   OF
                         COMMISSIONER SUSAN NESS
                                    


Re:  Geographic Partitioning and Spectrum Disaggregation by
Commercial Mobile Radio             Service Licensees

I support the substance of this item but want to interject a
cautionary note.

Our proposal to permit disaggregation and partitioning of the
personal communications services band is sound.  Most importantly,
it would enable more small businesses to "get a piece of the
action" by operating within a limited geographic area or on a slice
of spectrum.  
Many smaller players often lack the resources to provide service to
areas as large as the Major Trading Areas and Basic Trading Areas
that were the geographic building blocks in our auctions.  Some of
those who successfully bid on MTA and BTA licenses may not need 100
percent of their licensed spectrum blocks to provide their intended
services.  The changes proposed in this Notice may permit these two
situations to be reconciled, thereby enabling more entrepreneurs to
participate in providing services and facilitating more and better
services to be delivered to rural and other less-populated
geographic areas.

I support these proposed changes to our rules.  Nevertheless, I want
to signal a note of caution about the frequency of rule changes.  

Earlier today we adopted changes to our rules that permit PCS and
other commercial mobile radio service providers to provide any and
all fixed services in addition to mobile services, consistent with
our technical regulations.  As with our disaggregation and
partitioning proposals, these are revisions which I support.  

But, taken together, the changes proposed herein, the PCS service
revisions adopted today, and the other service and auction rule
changes we have adopted over the past several months constitute a
substantial modification of our rules in mid-stream -- after some
but not all of the licenses have been auctioned, and before the
licensees have had a chance to implement the business plans
pursuant to which they bid for their licenses. 

Flexibility and new ideas are always welcome, but constancy is
also a virtue.  Regulatory uncertainty has the potential to
undermine our services and our auctions by generating confusion on
the part of service providers and the financial community.

We can always improve upon our rules.  But I hope that we do not get in
the habit of repeatedly rewriting the rules before the ink is dry and
they have had a chance to be applied in the marketplace.  In my view,
absent a compelling need, our rules should remain in place at least
through initial construction periods. 

We are approaching the point where marketplace behavior may begin
to reflect the assumptions that our rules will continue to evolve
every few months and that therefore there is no need to comply with
those that have already been promulgated.  That would be grossly
unfair to those who diligently follow the rules as written.  We are
already too close to that point now, and I trust that we will not go
beyond it.
