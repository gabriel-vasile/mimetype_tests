      In clause (1), the word "adopt" is substituted for "enact", the

      In clause (6), the words "make contracts" are substituted for
    "make and enter into contracts" for consistency in the revised

      Clause (7) is substituted for 36:1303(d) for consistency in the
    revised title.
      In clause (8), the words "for the purposes of the corporation"
    are omitted as unnecessary. The words "instruments of indebtedness,
    and secure its obligations by granting security interests in its
    property" are substituted for "bonds therefor, and secure the same
    by mortgage" for consistency in the revised title. The words
    "subject in every case to all applicable provisions of Federal and
    State law" are omitted as unnecessary.
      In clause (10), the words "State, regional, local, and overseas"
    are omitted as unnecessary. The words "as needed" are substituted
    for "in such manner and by such rules as it deems appropriate so as
    to enable it", and the words "to carry out the purposes stated in
    section 220102 of this title" are substituted for "to carry out its
    powers and accomplish the objects and purposes set forth in section
    1302 of this title", to eliminate unnecessary words.
      In clause (11), the word "raise" is omitted as included in
    "solicit". The words "for the accomplishment of its purposes" are
    omitted as unnecessary. The words "accept gifts, legacies, devises,
    and support in furtherance thereof" are omitted as unnecessary
    because the same power is granted by the words "solicit funds" (in
    this clause) and "acquire [and] own . . . property" (in clause
    (6)).
      In clause (12), the words "in any court" are omitted as
    unnecessary.
      In clause (13), the words "any other act" are substituted for
    "any and all acts and things" for consistency in the revised title
    and to eliminate unnecessary words. The words "the purposes stated
    in section 220102 of this title" are substituted for "the foregoing
    specifically enumerated purposes" for clarity and consistency in
