CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY COMMISSION

16 CFR Ch. II

Regulatory Flexibility Act; Semiannual Regulatory Flexibility and 
Unified Agendas

AGENCY: Consumer Product Safety Commission.

ACTION: Semiannual regulatory agenda.

_______________________________________________________________________

SUMMARY: In this document, the Commission publishes its semiannual 
regulatory flexibility agenda. In addition, this document includes an 
agenda of regulatory actions the Commission expects to be under 
development or review by the agency during the next year. This document 
meets the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act and Executive 
Order 12866.

DATES: The Commission welcomes comments on each subject area of the 
agenda, particularly from small entities. Written comments concerning 
the agenda should be received in the Office of the Secretary by January 
31, 2003.

ADDRESSES: Comments on the regulatory flexibility agenda should be 
mailed to the Office of the Secretary, Consumer Product Safety 
Commission, Washington, DC 20207-0001; Telephone (301) 504-0800, or 
delivered to the Office of the Secretary, Room 502, 4330 East-West 
Highway, Bethesda, Maryland 20814-4423. Comments should be captioned 
``Regulatory Flexibility Agenda.'' Comments may also be filed by 
telefacsimile to (301) 504-0127, or by e-mail to cpsc-os@cpsc.gov.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: For further information on the agenda 
in general, contact Jacqueline Elder, Office of Hazard Identification 
and Reduction, Consumer Product Safety Commission, Washington, DC 
20207-0001, telephone (301) 504-7645, e-mail jelder@cpsc.gov. For 
further information regarding a particular item on the agenda, consult 
the individual listed in the column headed ``Contact'' for that 
particular item.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 
U.S.C. 601-612) contains several provisions intended to reduce 
unnecessary and disproportionate regulatory requirements on small 
businesses, small governmental organizations, and other small entities. 
Section 602 of the RFA (5 U.S.C. 602) requires each agency to publish 
twice each year a regulatory flexibility agenda containing a brief 
description of the subject area of any rule expected to be proposed or 
promulgated that is likely to have a ``significant economic impact'' on 
a ``substantial number'' of small entities. The agency must also 
provide a summary of the nature of the rule, and a schedule for acting 
on each rule for which the agency has issued a notice of proposed 
rulemaking.

     The regulatory flexibility agenda is also required to contain 
the name and address of the agency official knowledgeable about the 
items listed. Further, agencies are required to provide notice of 
their agendas to small entities and to solicit their comments by 
direct notification, or by inclusion in publications likely to be 
obtained by such entities.

     Additionally, Executive Order 12866 requires each agency to 
publish twice each year a regulatory agenda of regulations under 
development or review during the next year, and states that such an 
agenda may be combined with the agenda published in accordance with 
the RFA. The regulatory flexibility agenda published below lists 
the regulatory activities expected to be under development or 
review during the next 12 months. This agenda also includes 
regulatory activities that have been completed by the Commission 
prior to publication. It includes all such activities, whether or 
not they may have a significant economic impact on a substantial 
number of small entities.

     The agenda contains a brief description and summary of each 
regulatory activity, including the objectives and legal basis for 
each; an approximate schedule of target dates, subject to revision, 
for the development or completion of each activity, and the name 
and telephone number of a knowledgeable agency official concerning 
particular items on the agenda. All agency contacts have the same 
address: Consumer Product Safety Commission, Washington, DC 20207-
0001.

Dated: September 11, 2003.

 Todd Stevenson,

Secretary, Consumer Product Safety Commission.

3989. FLAMMABILITY STANDARD FOR UPHOLSTERED FURNITURE

Priority: Economically Significant. Major under 5 USC 801.

Legal Authority: 15 USC 1191, Flammable Fabrics Act

CFR Citation: 16 CFR 1640

Legal Deadline: None

Abstract: On June 15, 1994, the Commission published an advance notice 
of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) to begin a proceeding for development of 
a flammability standard to address risks of death, injury, and property 
damage from fires associated with ignition of upholstered furniture by 
small open--flame sources such as matches, lighters, or candles. The 
CPSC staff conducted research and developed a draft flammability 
performance standard. The draft standard was first presented to 
stakeholders at a 1996 ASTM voluntary standards meeting. The staff also 
worked with industry and voluntary standards groups to develop possible 
alternatives to a federal rule. In 1997, the staff forwarded a briefing 
package containing the draft standard and supporting data to the 
Commission.
In 1998, the Commission held a public hearing to gather additional 
information beyond that available to the agency on the potential 
toxicity, health risks, and environmental effects associated with 
flame--retardant chemicals that might be used to meet a standard. In 
CPSC's 1999 appropriations legislation, Congress directed the 
Commission to contract with the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) for 
an independent study of potential health hazards associated with the 
use of flame retardant chemicals that might be used in upholstered 
furniture fabrics to meet

[[Page 73864]]

a CPSC standard. The final NAS report was published in July 2000. The 
report concluded that of 16 flame--retardant chemicals reviewed, 8 
could be used in upholstered furniture fabrics without presenting 
health hazards to consumers.
A CPSC staff risk assessment concluded that a number of flame--
retardant chemicals are available that would not present health risks 
to consumers, although additional data are needed for some other 
chemicals. The CPSC staff has also worked with the National Institute 
of Occupational Safety and Health and the Environmental Protection 
Agency to evaluate possible impacts of flame--retardant chemical use on 
worker safety and the environment.
In 2001, the CPSC staff forwarded a briefing package containing an 
updated draft standard and supporting data to the Commission. In 2002, 
the Commission staff held a public meeting to receive any new technical 
information and recommendations from interested parties on the 
upholstered furniture project. In 2003, the staff forwarded a package 
to the Commission analyzing the information received at the meeting, 
and a package recommending that the Commission expand its proceeding to 
cover both small open flame and cigarette ignition risks. On October 
17, 2003, the Commission voted to issue a new ANPRM to start a 
proceeding to cover both small open flame and cigarette ignition risks.

3990. PETITION HP 00--2 REQUESTING A RULE DECLARING NATURAL RUBBER LATEX 
A STRONG SENSITIZER

Priority: Substantive, Nonsignificant. Major status under 5 USC 801 is 
undetermined.

Legal Authority: 5 USC 553(e), Administrative Procedure Act; 15 USC 
1261, Federal Hazardous Substances Act

CFR Citation: Not Yet Determined

Legal Deadline: None

Abstract: A petition from Debi Adkins, Editor, Latex Allergy News, 
requests that the Commission issue a rule declaring that natural rubber 
latex (NRL) and products containing NRL are strong sensitizers under 
the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (FHSA) and require labeling. NRL 
is in such consumer products as gloves, adhesives, shoes, balloons, 
pacifiers, and carpet backing, as well as many medical products. The 
petitioner states that a portion of the population has developed an 
allergy to latex that can be debilitating, even causing death. On March 
21, 2000, the Commission published a notice in the Federal Register to 
solicit comments on the petition from all interested persons. On May 
24, 2000, at the request of several persons, the Commission published a 
notice extending the original due date for comments of May 22, 2000, 
for 30 days to June 21, 2000. Eighty--four comments were received. 
Before completing the briefing package, the staff asked Federal experts 
to review the staff's assessment of the health effects related to 
latex. The staff incorporated comments from this review and has 
completed a briefing package for consideration by the Commission.

3994. PROPOSED RULE ON BABY BATH SEATS

Priority: Substantive, Nonsignificant. Major status under 5 USC 801 is 
undetermined.

Unfunded Mandates: Undetermined

Legal Authority: 15 USC 1261, Federal Hazardous Substances Act

CFR Citation: Not Yet Determined

Legal Deadline: None

Abstract: An advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM), published 
in the Federal Register on August 1, 2001, requested comments on a 
rulemaking proceeding that could result in a mandatory rule addressing 
baby bath seats. These are consumer products used to hold an infant in 
a bathtub while the child is being bathed. The Commission voted to 
publish the ANPRM and proceed with rulemaking after considering the 
staff's analysis of available data and information provided by the 
petitioners, the Consumer Federation of America and other consumer 
groups who requested that the Commission ban baby bath seats and bath 
rings. The staff briefed the Commission on July 28, 2003, and the 
Commission received oral comments from the public on the same date. The 
staff evaluated the comments received at the hearing and sent a 
briefing package to the Commission. On October 16, 2003, the Commission 
decided to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking and directed the staff 
to prepare it for the Commission's consideration.

3995. AMENDMENT OF SAFETY REGULATIONS FOR CRIBS

Priority: Substantive, Nonsignificant. Major status under 5 USC 801 is 
undetermined.

Legal Authority: 5 USC 553, Administrative Procedure Act; 15 USC 1261, 
Federal Hazardous Substances Act

CFR Citation: 16 CFR 1508; 16 CFR 1509

Legal Deadline: None

Abstract: On December 16, 1996, the Commission published an advance 
notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) to begin a proceeding that could 
result in amendment of the safety regulations for full--size and non--
full--size cribs, 16 CFR parts 1508 and 1509. Among the regulatory 
alternatives under consideration is amendment of the regulations to add 
tests to assure that slats will not disengage from the side panels of 
cribs. The Commission began this proceeding after considering 
information about incidents in which crib slats disengaged from the 
side panels of cribs, creating a risk that children may become 
entrapped between the remaining slats or fall out of the crib. At the 
urging of CPSC staff, in April 1999, the voluntary standard for cribs 
designated, ``Specification for Full Size Baby Cribs (ASTM F1169--
99),'' and published by ASTM International was revised to include 
performance requirements for crib slats. The Commission will consider 
written comments received in response to the ANPRM, and assess the 
adequacy of and conformance with the voluntary standard before deciding 
whether to continue the proceeding by publication of a notice of 
proposed rulemaking, or terminate further proceedings.

3996. AMENDMENT OF THE STANDARD FOR THE FLAMMABILITY OF CLOTHING 
TEXTILES

Priority: Substantive, Nonsignificant. Major status under 5 USC 801 is 
undetermined.

Legal Authority: 15 USC 1191, Flammable Fabrics Act

[[Page 73867]]

CFR Citation: 16 CFR 1610

Legal Deadline: None

Abstract: The Standard for the Flammability of Clothing Textiles 
prohibits the manufacture, importation, or sale of clothing, and 
fabrics and related materials intended for use in clothing, which are 
dangerously flammable because of rapid and intense burning. The 
standard prescribes the apparatus, procedure, and criteria to be used 
for testing to determine compliance with that standard. The standard 
was made mandatory by the Flammable Fabrics Act of 1953 (Pub. L. 83--
88, 67 Stat. 111; June 30, 1953). Some of the equipment and procedures 
specified by the standard, particularly those for laundering and 
cleaning of test specimens, have become obsolete, unavailable, or 
unrepresentative of current practices. The staff prepared a briefing 
package describing modifications of the standard that may be needed to 
assure that the test in the standard is conducted with equipment and 
procedures representative of conditions to which garments currently are 
exposed. After consideration of the briefing package, the Commission 
decided to begin a proceeding for amendment of the standard. An advance 
notice of proposed rulemaking was published in the Federal Register on 
September 12, 2002. The staff is reviewing public comments and will 
develop proposed amendments for Commission consideration.

3997. PORTABLE BED RAILS

Priority: Substantive, Nonsignificant. Major status under 5 USC 801 is 
undetermined.

Legal Authority: 15 USC 1261, Federal Hazardous Substances Act

CFR Citation: Not Yet Determined

Legal Deadline: None

Abstract: The Commission is considering whether certain portable bed 
rails present an unreasonable risk of injury that should be regulated. 
A portable bed rail is a device intended to be installed on an adult 
bed to prevent a child from falling out of the bed. Such bed rails may 
be constructed in a manner that allows children to become entrapped 
between the portable bed rail and the bed. This entrapment can result 
in serious injury or death. The ASTM standard for bed rails has been 
revised and staff will evaluate the adequacy of, and conformance to, 
the revised standard. Following this evaluation, the Commission staff 
will prepare a briefing package for Commission consideration as to 
whether to continue the rulemaking.

3998. PROPOSED STANDARD TO ADDRESS OPEN--FLAME IGNITION OF MATTRESSES/
BEDDING

Priority: Substantive, Nonsignificant

Legal Authority: 15 USC 1193, Flammable Fabrics Act

CFR Citation: Not Yet Determined

Legal Deadline: None

Abstract: In 1995, the Commission staff began a project on mattress 
fires. Subsequent to that, the Commission docketed two petitions from 
the Children's Coalition for Fire--Safe Mattresses, FP 00--1 and FP 
00--2, requesting certain standards to address the open flame ignition 
hazard with mattresses/bedding. On October 2, 2001, the Commission 
voted to grant these two petitions and issue an ANPRM addressing this 
mattress flammability hazard. The Commission published an advance 
notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) in the Federal Register of 
October 11, 2001, that requested comments on a rulemaking proceeding 
that could result in a mandatory flammability standard addressing open 
flame ignition of mattresses/bedding. The staff will address public 
comments on the ANPRM and prepare a briefing package for Commission 
consideration with a draft proposed rule for mattresses. The staff is 
also preparing a briefing package for Commission consideration as to 
whether to issue an ANPRM to address the flammability of bedding.

3999. TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING APPLICABILITY OF CAUTIONARY LABELING 
AND CHILD--RESISTANT PACKAGING TO HYDROCARBON--CONTAINING PRODUCTS IN 
SPRAY PACKAGING

Priority: Substantive, Nonsignificant. Major status under 5 USC 801 is 
undetermined.

Legal Authority: 15 USC 1471, Poison Prevention Packaging Act; 15 USC 
1261(p), Federal Hazardous Substances Act

CFR Citation: Not Yet Determined

Legal Deadline: None

Abstract: On January 3, 2000, CPSC issued a notice of proposed 
rulemaking under the Poison Prevention Packaging Act (PPPA) to require 
child--resistant packaging of prepackaged products that contain liquid 
hydrocarbons of low viscosity, including aerosol/trigger/pump packaged 
products (spray products) that expel product in a stream. The final 
rule issued on October 25, 2001, covered liquid hydrocarbon--containing 
products other than these spray products.
Under current CPSC guidance, special cautionary labeling under the 
Federal Hazardous Substances Act (FHSA) would also be required for most 
hydrocarbon--containing spray products that expel product as a stream. 
The staff has now developed a quantitative test method to identify 
those hydrocarbon--containing spray products that pose an aspiration 
hazard. The staff is preparing a briefing package for the Commission's 
consideration that may recommend using this test method to determine 
applicability of the FHSA special cautionary labeling and PPPA child--
resistant packaging requirements to spray products that expel product 
in a stream.

4001. POSSIBLE SPECIAL PACKAGING STANDARD FOR HOUSEHOLD PRODUCTS 
CONTAINING HYDROXIDES

Priority: Substantive, Nonsignificant. Major status under 5 USC 801 is 
undetermined.

Unfunded Mandates: Undetermined

Legal Authority: 15 USC 1471, Poison Prevention Packaging Act; 15 USC 
1261(p), Federal Hazardous Substances Act

CFR Citation: Not Yet Determined

Legal Deadline: None

Abstract: Sodium and potassium hydroxide are caustic substances found 
in many household products. In addition to sodium and potassium 
hydroxide, other hydroxides, such as calcium, lithium, and ammonium 
hydroxide are also found in consumer products. There are numerous 
reports of injuries, ranging from minor irritation to second degree 
burns of the oral cavity, esophagus, eyes, and skin resulting from 
exposure to these products. Because of the potential for injury to 
children, household substances in dry forms containing 10 percent or 
more by weight of free or chemically unneutralized sodium and/or 
potassium hydroxide, and all other household substances containing 2 
percent or more by weight of free or chemically unneutralized sodium 
and/or potassium hydroxide currently require child resistant packaging 
under the Poison Prevention Packaging Act.
Based upon new injury and toxicity information, the staff is 
considering whether to recommend: (1) requiring

[[Page 73869]]

special packaging for all hydroxides, and (2) decreasing the percentage 
of sodium and potassium hydroxide for special packaging to be required. 
The staff is preparing a briefing package for Commission consideration.

4006. PETITION HP 01--03 REQUESTING A BAN ON USE OF CHROMATED--COPPER--
ARSENATE (CCA) TREATED WOOD IN PLAYGROUND EQUIPMENT

Priority: Substantive, Nonsignificant. Major status under 5 USC 801 is 
undetermined.

Unfunded Mandates: Undetermined

Legal Authority: 15 USC 1262, Federal Hazardous Substance Act

CFR Citation: Not Yet Determined

Legal Deadline: None

Abstract: A petition from the Environmental Working Group and Healthy 
Building Network, docketed June 20, 2001, requests that the Commission 
enact an immediate ban on the use of chromated copper arsenate (CCA) 
treated wood in playground equipment. This treatment is used as a 
pesticide in the wood. The petitioners assert that a ban is necessary 
because recent research has shown that arsenic is more carcinogenic 
than was previously recognized, and is present at significant 
concentrations on CCA treated wood and in underlying soil. They further 
assert that the health risks posed by this wood are greater than was 
previously recognized, and that past risk assessments were incomplete. 
The petitioners also requested that the Commission review the safety of 
CCA treated wood for general use. Such a review would not require 
rulemaking to implement. Therefore, this request was not docketed. On 
July 13, 2001, the Commission published a notice in the Federal 
Register to solicit comments on the petition. The 60--day comment 
period ended on September 11, 2001. Commission staff reviewed comments 
received on the petition and conducted studies to obtain exposure data 
to assess possible health risks to children from the use of CCA--
treated wood in playground equipment. The Conference report 
accompanying the Commission's FY 2002 appropriation directed the CPSC 
to submit a report to Congress on its work on CCA treated wood and 
steps taken to inform State and local governments of that work. The 
report was submitted to the appropriations committees of both houses of 
Congress on February 15, 2002. Also, in February 2002, the USEPA 
announced that the manufacturers of CCA had requested that 
registrations of CCA be cancelled, effective December 31, 2003. The 
staff's exposure and risk assessment was reviewed by outside experts. 
Commission staff prepared an options briefing package, including its 
risk assessment, that was sent to the Commission on February 7, 2003, 
for its consideration. The Commission held a public meeting on March 
17--18, 2003, that included a briefing by CPSC staff members on their 
studies and evaluations, as well as testimony from interested public 
parties. The Commission's staff analyzed comments received at the 
hearing and after the hearing and prepared another package for the 
Commission that responds to these comments. On November 4, 2003, the 
Commission voted to deny the petition.
