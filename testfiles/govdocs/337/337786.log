So there was a source which stuck in the plug. We took a special run to see if this will cause any hot towers during normal data taking. The "SUM_ET_SPIKE_STUDY" trigger was used for this run with SUM_ET_1 trigger. As it was seen from the event display, there were no any hot towers.

And the trigger rate was reasonable too!

<pre>PLUG DETECTOR SOURCING 
 
STARTED AT 6:30 a.m. 
Continued sourcing the preshower tubes. Taken runs with numbers 113536 and 113537 for  tubes 19 and 32.  
 
AT 6:41 ENCOUNTERED A PROBLEM!! 
The source sent by the driver 1 East got stucked inside the tube 32, which corresponds to NORTH WEST LOWER quadrant of the detector. It is at aprrox. 57,000 counts which is somewhere close to the edge of the detector. 
THE SOURCE IS STILL OUT OF THE GARAGE WERE NOT ABLE TO RETRACT IT REMOTELY. </pre>

<p>I've now changed the ATM switching fabric connected to the converter nodes to the spare fabric. The fabric connected to the SCPUs is the one we were using all along up until last Friday night. Let's see how this behaves. A test run with 14 subfarms seemed to be OK, no reformatter errors or slow running.

<pre>We got HV trip in CPR. Paging experts... no response... 
HV is reset from the IFIX page.

<pre>Jean and me have disabled slots  
8,10,12,19 in fib_02 
10,13,15,17,18,19 in fib_06 
in HWDB, (even though unnecessary hdi's are disabled there) 
 
slots 16/fib_01 and 16/fib_05 are enabled, so we can just 
include fibs 1 and 5 into RC when the beam is stable. 
Fib02, Fib06 are included in the RC now.

<big><i> 
New trigger table 36x36_1_Coupled v 3 was successfully created. It has level3 triggers that are fed by level 1 triggers. The table was creted based on 36_36_1 v 14 trigger table.  
<br> 
Farrukh, successfully built tcl file for it.  
<br>  
We were able to download it in the test run. We are running without any problems for a long time.

REMINDER: to select this trigger, ACES should use "Trigger Type" button on run editor panel. Do not go to "Tools" submenu, because you will not find it there.

MCR called- power supply trouble in a transfer line, but should be a quick fix.  Shot might be in at 3:30.

<pre> We are stopping this run which collected (only) 17K events, 
and start running Silicon in calibCont mode.</pre>

MCR called (~20 minutes ago) to say it now looks like there will be no beam in the Tevatron for two hours.  Called Jean Slaughter so she could do her run that requires no beam.

MCR called to say we could get Tevatron beam soon, so we are turning off silicon voltages.
