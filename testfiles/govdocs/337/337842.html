Contents
 
               Subpart Q_Concrete and Masonry Construction
 
Sec.  1926.706  Requirements for masonry construction.

    (a) A limited access zone shall be established whenever a masonry 
wall is being constructed. The limited access zone shall conform to the 
following.
    (1) The limited access zone shall be established prior to the start 
of construction of the wall.
    (2) The limited access zone shall be equal to the height of the wall 
to be constructed plus four feet, and shall run the entire length of the 
wall.
    (3) The limited access zone shall be established on the side of the 
wall which will be unscaffolded.
    (4) The limited access zone shall be restricted to entry by 
employees actively engaged in constructing the wall. No other employees 
shall be permitted to enter the zone.

[[Page 410]]

    (5) The limited access zone shall remain in place until the wall is 
adequately supported to prevent overturning and to prevent collapse 
unless the height of wall is over eight feet, in which case, the limited 
access zone shall remain in place until the requirements of paragraph 
(b) of this section have been met.
    (b) All masonry walls over eight feet in height shall be adequately 
braced to prevent overturning and to prevent collapse unless the wall is 
adequately supported so that it will not overturn or collapse. The 
bracing shall remain in place until permanent supporting elements of the 
structure are in place.
