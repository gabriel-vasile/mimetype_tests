How to Take Your Medicine:  Beta Blocker Drugs 

How you take a drug can be very important to both its effectiveness and 
safety. Sometimes it can be almost as important as what you take. Timing, 
what you eat and when you eat, proper dose, and many other factors can mean 
the difference between feeling better, staying the same, or even feeling
worse. This drug information page is intended to help you make your 
treatment work as effectively as possible. It is important to note, however,
that this is only a guideline. You should talk to your doctor about how and 
when to take any prescribed drugs.

The sixth installment of this series features a group of drugs called beta
blockers. 

Conditions These Drugs Treat

All beta blockers are used to treat high blood pressure. Many are also used 
to prevent the heart-related chest pain or pressure associated with angina
pectoris (a condition often occurring during exertion where too little blood
reaches the heart). Atenolol, metoprolol, timolol, and propranolol are used 
to improve survival after a heart attack. Propranolol is used to treat heart
rhythm problems, other specific heart conditions, migraine headaches, and 
tremors. Beta blockers can be used for other conditions as determined by
your doctor.

Beta blockers cannot cure these conditions. However, by blocking certain
receptors in the body, beta blockers lower and regulate the heartbeat and 
lessen the heart's workload.

While taking beta blockers, it is important that you continue any diet and
exercise program prescribed by your doctor, as these are often important
parts of the therapy for the conditions being treated.

How to Take 

Beta blockers can be taken either with food or on an empty stomach. 

If you are taking an extended-release product such as Inderal LAR 
(propranolol), swallow it whole. Don't chew it or crush it in any way.

If you are taking the concentrated solution of propranolol, always use the
dropper provided. You can mix the solution with water or any other beverage 
(or, if you prefer, pudding or applesauce). After taking a dose, rinse the
glass with some liquid and drink that liquid as well to be sure that the
entire dose is taken. 

Be sure to take the right number of tablets or capsules for each dose.
Taking your medicine at the same time each day will help you remember to
take it regularly.

Missed Doses

Do not suddenly stop taking a beta blocker without first talking to your
doctor. Your condition could worsen if you stop taking this medicine or miss
many doses. 

If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember. If you take the beta 
blocker once a day, you can take it up to eight hours before the next 
scheduled dose. If you take the medication more often than once a day, you
can take it up to four hours before the next scheduled dose. Ask your doctor
or pharmacist if you have questions.

Never take two doses at the same time.

Always have enough of your beta blocker medicine to last over weekends, 
holiday periods, and when you travel. 

Relief of Symptoms

For conditions such as high blood pressure, angina, heart rhythm
disturbances, or tremors, some effects can be seen immediately and usually
peak within a week. If treating migraine headaches, it may take up to six 
weeks before the full effects occur. For any of these conditions, the dosage
of the beta blocker may need to be adjusted by your doctor when you first 
begin taking it. Also, the appropriate dosage can vary greatly among people,
depending on individual response. 

Since many of the conditions that beta blockers treat are chronic, you may
have to take this medicine for the rest of your life. 

Side Effects and Risks

Common side effects include slowed heartbeat, tiredness, nausea, diarrhea,
constipation, and decreased sexual ability. Other mild side effects can 
include difficulty sleeping or nightmares, headache, drowsiness, and
numbness or tingling of the fingers, toes or scalp. Also, if you have 
diabetes, beta blockers can obscure some of the signs of low blood sugar, 
such as tremors or rapid heartbeat. Check with your doctor if any of these
side effects seems troublesome or if you have any questions.

More serious reactions can sometimes occur with beta blockers. These include
the following:

* the beginning or worsening of heart failure. Symptoms of this include 
shortness of breath (especially on exertion), coughing, weakness, weight
gain, and swelling of feet, ankles, or lower legs.
* severe wheezing or difficulty breathing, especially in people who have or 
have had asthma, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, or other breathing
conditions. Because beta blockers can trigger or worsen these conditions, 
make sure your doctor knows about them. 
* an extremely slow heartbeat (less than 50 beats per minute) 
* cold hands and feet or blue fingernails, which could mean reduced 
circulation to these areas
* confusion, hallucinations or depression.
If any of these or other serious reactions occur, call your doctor
immediately.

Precautions and Warnings

If you suddenly stop taking a beta blocker, you could worsen your condition 
and experience potentially dangerous side effects, such as chest pain, fast 
or irregular heartbeat, high blood pressure, and headaches. Always check
with your doctor before discontinuing a beta blocker. 

Consult with your doctor if you think you could become pregnant or plan to
breast-feed while on a beta blocker.

Learn how the medicine affects you. Don't drive or operate machines if this 
medicine makes you drowsy, dizzy or lightheaded. If you are taking
labetalol, dizziness or lightheadedness can occur when getting up from
sitting or lying down. If this happens, sit up slowly, placing your legs
over the side of the bed or couch, and stay there for a few minutes before
trying to stand.

Before any surgery or dental work, tell the physician or dentist that you 
are taking beta blockers. Tell your physician if you are taking or
considering taking any other prescription or nonprescription medication.

Drinking alcohol while on beta blockers can sometimes increase the chance of
side effects such as dizziness or tiredness.

Drug Tips 

Don't store drugs in the bathroom medicine cabinet. Heat and humidity may 
cause the medicine to lose its effectiveness. Keep all medicines, even those
with child-resistant caps, out of the reach of children. Remember, the caps 
are child-resistant, not child-proof. Discard medicines that have reached 
the expiration date.
