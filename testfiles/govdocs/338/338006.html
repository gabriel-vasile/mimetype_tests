</p>

  <p>The climatology is available in NetCDF, Matlab and
ASCII formats. <a href="mailto:Rick.Lumpkin@noaa.gov">E-mail me</a>
if you would like to get this data in a different
format. </p>
  <p>Two versions of the climatology are available.
The first version (
  <a href="http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/phod/dac/Drifter_Annual_Climatology.nc">
	NetCDF</a>/
  <a href="http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/phod/dac/drifter_annualmeans.mat">
	Matlab binary format</a>/
  <a href="http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/phod/dac/drifter_annualmeans_ascii.dat">
	ASCII</a>)
contains annual mean values of the near-surface
currents and subskin sea surface temperature.
The Matlab file contains the following variables:
 </p>
</dd>
<dd><b><b>Lon (1x361): longitude (degrees), negative=West.
  </b></b></dd>
<dd><b><b>Lat (1x141): latitude (degrees), 70S to 70N.
  </b></b></dd>
<dd><b><b>V (141x361): northward speed (m/s) vs. Lat/Lon.
  </b></b></dd>
<dd><b><b>U (141x361): eastward speed (m/s).
  </b></b></dd>
<dd><b><b>SST (141x361): sea surface temperature (degrees C).
  </b></b></dd>
<dd><b><b>V_g (141x361): Ekman-removed (see below) northward speed.
  </b></b></dd>
<dd><b><b>U_g (141x361): Ekman-removed eastward speed.
  </b></b></dd>
<dd><b><b>eV, eU, etc: standard error bars for V, U, etc.
  </b></b></dd>
<dd><b><b>N (141x361): Number of drifter-days per square degree.
  </b></b>
<p>The ASCII version contains a subset of these data.  The colums of
the ASCII dataset are: Lat, Lon, SST, U, V, eU, eV, eSST.
  <p>The second version (
  <a href="http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/phod/dac/Drifter_Monthly_Climatology.nc">
	NetCDF</a>/
  <a href="http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/phod/dac/drifter_monthlymeans.mat">
	Matlab binary format</a>
  <a href="http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/phod/dac/drifter_monthlymeans_ascii.dat">
	ASCII</a>)
contains monthly mean values of these fields. 
The variable names of the Matlab file are the same as above.
The third index of matrix U, V, etc. corresponds to the month:
1=January, 2=February, etc.  In the ASCII dataset, the first column 
is the month; the rest of the columns are the same as in the annual
climatology file described above.

  <p><b><b>Description</b></b>: satellite-tracked SVP drifting buoys
(Sybrandy and Niiler, 1991; Niiler, 2001)
provide observations of near-surface circulation at unprecedented
resolution. In September 2005, the Global Drifter Array became the
first fully realized component of the Global Ocean Observing System
when it reached an array size of 1250 drifters.
A drifter is composed of a surface float which
includes a transmittor to relay data,
a thermometer which reads temperature a few
centimeters below the air/sea interface,
and a submergence sensor used to detect when/if
the drogue is lost. The surface float is
tethered to a subsurface float which minimizes
rectification of surface wave motion
(Niiler <i>et al.</i>, 1987; Niiler <i>et al.</i>, 1995).
This in turn is tethered to a holey sock drogue,
centered at 15 m depth. The drifter follows
the flow integrated over the drogue depth,
although some slip with respect to this motion
is associated with direct wind forcing
(Niiler and Paduan, 1995). This slip is greatly
enhanced in drifters which have lost their
drogues (Pazan and Niiler, 2000).
Drifter velocities are derived from finite
differencing their raw position fixes.
These velocities, and the concurrent SST
measurements, are archived at AOML's
  <a href="http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/phod/dac/dacdata.html">Drifting Buoy
Data Assembly Center</a>
where the data are quality controlled and
interpolated to 1/4-day intervals
(Hansen and Herman, 1989; Hansen and Poulain, 1996).
 </p>

 <p>In this study, daily winds from the <a href="http://www.cdc.noaa.gov/cdc/reanalysis/reanalysis.shtml">
NCEP/NCAR reanalysis</a>
were interpolated onto the drifter
positions and used to estimate and remove the
slip (Niiler and Paduan, 1995; Pazan and Niiler, 2000).
Wind stress and the local Coriolis
parameter were used to estimate the Ekman
component (Ralph and Niiler, 1999), which was
subtracted to generate a separate set of
Ekman-removed velocities. All velocities and
SSTs were lowpassed at five days to remove
high frequency variability (diurnal, tidal, inertial).
</p>

<p>Drifters sample regions of the ocean inhomogeneously,
which can cause aliased time-mean values if the
presence of strong seasonal variations are neglected.
To address this, Lumpkin (2003) developed a methodology
to simultaneously decompose the drifter observations
into time-mean, seasonal and eddy components.
Lumpkin showed that this methodology produces significantly
different results than standard bin averaging. </p>

  <p>This methodology was further developed and
evaluated using SST observations and products,
and simulated drifters in the MICOM model
(Lumpkin and Garraffo, 2005). The method
produces significantly improved estimates of
the mean currents and SST, and simultaneously
provides the annual and semiannual amplitudes and
phases at a nominal resolution of one degree squared.
</p>

  <p>When this methodology is applied to the modern data set of
tropical Atlantic drifter observations, many features of the
near-surface circulation become apparent which
were not resolved by older ship-drift-based
climatologies or by SEQUAL/FOCAL drifter
trajectories (Lumpkin and Garzoli, 2005).
 </p>

  <p>To derive the fields contained in the
climatology provided here, the time-mean,
annual and semiannual components of total
velocity and of SST were combined and integrated
to yield monthly averages. Results were smoothed
via Optimum Interpolation (c.f., Cuny <i>et al.</i>, 2002), assuming a
Gaussian autocorrelation function with an isotropic e-folding scale of
150 km. Some regions do not contain
values (placeholder "NaN"). With
future deployments focusing upon these regions,
and the ever-growing array soon able to achieve comparable resolution
of interannual variations,
future analyses efforts promise exciting new
results in this region.

  <p><i>Credits:</i> This climatology was developed
by Rick Lumpkin (NOAA/AOML) in collaboration
with Silvia Garzoli and Mayra Pazos (NOAA/AOML),
Jessica Redman (CIMAS), and Zulema Garraffo
(RSMAS, Univ. Miami). Code to convert Matlab
files into NetCDF format was provided by Derrick Snowden
(NOAA/AOML).
