<div>
<h3>National Denominator</h3>
<p>Adults age 18 and over who reported in the survey year that they currently smoke, had a routine checkup in the past 12 months, and answered the question: "In the past 12 months did a doctor advise you to stop smoking?" Nonresponses and "Don't know" responses were excluded.</p>

<div>
<h3>Comments</h3>
<p>The allowable responses to the MEPS survey question about smoking changed in 2003. Therefore, reported national rates may not be comparable with earlier years.</p>
<p>The national table reports data from the MEPS Self-Administered Questionnaire (SAQ). Go to the MEPS entry in the Data Sources Appendix for more information on the SAQ. Percents in the State table are age adjusted to the 2000 standard population.</p>
<p>This measure is referred to as measure 1-3c in Healthy People 2010 documentation.</p>
