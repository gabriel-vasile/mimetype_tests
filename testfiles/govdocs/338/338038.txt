SOLAR STATUS
------------
CME on Friday evening. LASCO saw their 31st comet (a sun-grazer) on
Friday. NW limb had an ejection on Sunday.
AR in the South had a half halo event on Sunday at about 16:00 UT.
This morning LASCO saw an eruption in the SW.


INSTRUMENT STATUS
-----------------
CDS:	Nominal. Saturday: JOP 12/17, coronal hole campaign, observations of
	coronal hole just above the N limb.
	Sunday: JOP 12/17, coronal hole campaign, observations of coronal
	hole just above the S limb. Today: coronal hole campaign.

SUMER:	Nominal. Weekend: JOP 12/17. Today: coronal hole campaign.

UVCS:	Nominal. Weekend and today: electron temp study on W streamer at 3 Rs
	looking at Ly-a resonantly scattered component images on the Ly-a
	channel blocker. The electron Ly-a component can be measured
        because it is imaged on both sides of the blocker. Tuesday: intercal01.

LASCO:	Nominal. Synoptic program, microjet campaign.  They detected some
        "debris" in one of their images at 9:45 UT today.  Only seen in
        one image.  (No one doing anything anomalous at the time -- no
        doors being open/closed..)

EIT: 	Nominal. Weekend: JOP 12/17, campaign 2030. Today: campaign 2030, 
	microjet campaign.  Will participate in Intercal tomorrow.

MDI:	Nominal. Weekend: full disk mags. Today: full disk mags during
	short contact and switching to high res and full disk mags (mag movies)
	campaign today and for the continuous contact.  MDI saw a pointing
	plateau that was very stable and was 2 arcseconds above normal pointing
	from 16:00 UT yesterday - 04:00 UT today - cause unknown.
