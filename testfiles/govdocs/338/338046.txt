	SOHO Daily Status Meeting: 15th April 1996

The meeting was chaired by Laura Allen.

FOT:	Spacecraft is nominal.  Adjustment of the duty cycle for SVM
	heaters was carried out.  A time tag load for Virgo was missed;
	this came in on Saturday for execution on Sunday.  
	Investigation as to the cause is underway.  The DSN situation 
	is nominal; however, scheduling of NRT in recent days has 
	been inconvenient, requiring early morning and late evening
	experient supports.

EXPTS:	MDI: 	is nominal.
	Sumer:	Nominal; preparation for coordinated Bright Point 
		observation program.
	CDS:	Nominal; preparing for BP observations.
	EIT:	Nominal; observed a shrinking of the disk coronal
		hole over the weekend.  EIT can report that the sun-
		center location calculations showed no change after
		adjustment of the SVM duty cycle.
	UVCS:	A measurement of electron temperature was attempted,
		as planned. by putting Ly-alpha on the blocker and
		observing the wings.
	Lasco:	Nominal.

Spacecraft RE-POINTING MANEUVER is planned for tomorrow.  OCD covering
this is due today at 12:00 hrs.  The plan agreed on is to move the
spacecraft pointing 3.3 arc minutes North, and 0.0 arc minutes
East-West.  Contact begins at 2100 UT; an hour of NRT is available for
UVCS observations of the north pole, and for Lasco door-closings, from
about 2200 to 2300.  Maneuver should start about 2300.  The re-point
will be done in a number of steps; detailed plan will be
presented at the Status Meeting tomorrow morning.
