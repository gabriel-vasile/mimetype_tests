<P>I.     <U>Statement of the Case</U></P>

<P>  This matter is before the Authority on the Respondent's
motion for reconsideration of our decision in 44 FLRA 1306 (1992). 
Neither the General Counsel nor the Charging Party filed a
response to the motion.</P>

<P>  For the following reasons, we conclude that the Respondent
has failed to establish that extraordinary circumstances exist
warranting reconsideration of our decision.  Accordingly, we will
deny the Respondent's motion for reconsideration.</P>

<P>II.    <U>The Decision in 44 FLRA 1306</U></P>

<P>  In 44 FLRA 1306, we adopted the Judge's conclusions that the
Respondent violated section 7116(a)(1), (5), and (8) of the
Statute by failing to comply timely with an arbitration award when
it unreasonably delayed offering to reinstate an employee and
unreasonably delayed delivering the employee's backpay check, and section 7116(a)(1) and (8) of
the Statute by denying the employee backpay for a specific 2-week
period. </P>

<P>  We also concluded, contrary to the Judge, that the Respondent
violated section 7116(a)(1), (5), and (8) of the Statute by
failing to comply timely with the arbitration award when it
unreasonably delayed processing the employee's backpay claim.  The
Respondent argued that it was unable to begin processing the
employee's backpay claim until the employee had been
reinstated--October 8, 1989.  We rejected that argument and found
that nothing in the record indicated that the Respondent was
unable to begin gathering information on the employee's interim
employment as of July 31, 1989--the date the award became final. 
Further, in view of the Judge's conclusion that the Respondent
unreasonably and intentionally delayed offering to reinstate the
employee, we stated that we would "not permit the Respondent to
benefit from that delay or use that delay as a basis for failing
to begin processing the employee's backpay claim until after the
date of reinstatement."  44 FLRA at 1314.  Rather, we concluded
that because of the Respondent's unlawful refusal to reinstate the
employee and its unexplained failure to gather information on the
employee's interim employment in a timely manner, the Respondent's
intentional failure to begin processing the backpay claim until
after the date of reinstatement was unreasonable and violated
section 7116(a)(1), (5), and (8) of the Statute.  </P>

<P>  Further, we concluded, contrary to the Judge, that the
Respondent violated section 7116(a)(1) and (8) of the Statute by
failing and refusing to comply with the backpay portion of the
arbitration award when it improperly deducted from the backpay
award the employee's overtime earnings from his interim job at the
Circle-K Corporation and the employee's earnings from his
"moonlighting" job at a Wal-Mart store.  In reaching this
conclusion, we found that the arbitration award at issue
unambiguously required the Respondent to give the employee the
full amount of backpay that he was entitled to receive under the
Back Pay Act and its implementing regulations.  <U>See</U> <U>id.</U> at 1316. 
Upon examining the Respondent's method of calculating backpay, we
determined that the Respondent had not calculated the employee's
backpay entitlement consistent with the Back Pay Act and its
implementing regulations because the Respondent should not have
made the deductions noted above. </P>

<P>  Specifically, we found that with respect to the employee's
interim overtime earnings, the Respondent could deduct from an
award of backpay "the amount of overtime  earned [in interim
employment] to the extent that the employee would have worked that
amount of overtime in the [A]gency job."  44 FLRA at 1318.  We
found that "[i]f the employee would not have worked overtime in
the [A]gency job or would have worked less overtime in the
[A]gency job, the [Respondent could] not deduct from the
employee's backpay award the excess amount of interim overtime
wages that the employee earned."  <U>Id.</U>  We based these findings on
the wording of the Back Pay Act and its implementing regulations
and on the interpretation of those provisions by the Merit Systems
Protection Board (MSPB) since its decision in <U>Phelps v. Department
of Labor</U>, 35 M.S.P.R. 273 (1987) (<U>Phelps</U>).  We stated that this
position was consistent with decisions by courts and the National
Labor Relations Board (NLRB) in the private sector.  Further, we
noted that, by its terms, the Federal Personnel Manual did not
apply to interim overtime earnings.  As there was no indication
that the employee here would have worked overtime for the
Respondent, we concluded that the Respondent improperly deducted
the employee's interim overtime earnings from his backpay
entitlement.</P>

<P>  With respect to the employee's "moonlighting" earnings from
his job at Wal-Mart, we found that, based on the wording of the
backpay regulations and on decisions by a Federal district court
and the MSPB, the Respondent could not deduct "moonlighting"
earnings from the employee's backpay entitlement if the employee
could have held the "moonlighting" job while working for the
agency.  <U>See</U> 44 FLRA at 1321-22 (citing <U>Payne v. Panama Canal Co.</U>,
428 F. Supp. 997, 1001 (D.C. Canal Zone 1977) (<U>Payne</U>), <U>rev'd on
other grounds</U>, 607 F.2d 155 (5th Cir. 1979) and <U>Broadnax v. United
States Postal Service</U>, 35 M.S.P.R. 219, 228 (1987) (<U>Broadnax</U>)). 
We stated that this position was consistent with decisions by
courts and the NLRB in the private sector.  Further, we found
that, by its terms, the FPM did not require the Respondent to
deduct the employee's "moonlighting" earnings because those
earnings did not act "as a substitute for" the Agency job.  <U>Id.</U> at
1323 (quoting FPM Supp. 990-2, Book 550, Subchapter S8-7c(1)
(paragraph 2)).  We adopted the Judge's finding, which was not
excepted to by the parties, that the employee's "second, or
'moonlighting,' job" at Wal-Mart could have been "held
simultaneously with his government job."  <U>Id.</U> at 1321 (citing
Judge's Decision at 11).  Therefore, as the employee in this case
worked in a "moonlighting" job for Wal-Mart which he could have
held while working for the Respondent, we concluded that, under
the Back Pay Act and its implementing regulations, the Respondent
improperly deducted the employee's "moonlighting" earnings from
the employee's backpay entitlement.</P>

<P>  Having found that the Respondent's actions were inconsistent
with the Back Pay Act and its implementing regulations, we found
that the Respondent disregarded the backpay portion of the
arbitration award and thereby failed to comply with the award in
violation of section 7116(a)(1) and (8) of the Statute.  To remedy
the Respondent's unfair labor practices, we modified the Judge's
recommended Order and Notice to reflect that the Respondent failed
to comply timely with the arbitration award by unreasonably
delaying the processing of the employee's backpay claim.  Further,
we required the Respondent to reimburse the employee, with
interest to the date of payment, for any overtime and
"moonlighting" earnings that were improperly deducted from the
backpay award.  </P>

<P>III.   <U>The Respondent's Motion for Reconsideration</U></P>

<P>  The Respondent requests that we reconsider our finding that
the Respondent "committed an unfair labor practice by failing to
timely process the employee's backpay check."  Motion for
Reconsideration at 3.  The Respondent argues that it was
"impossible" to process the employee's backpay claim until the
employee had been restored to duty because "[o]nly after
reinstatement can an agency determine how much total backpay is
owed to the employee and begin the process of offsetting outside
earnings."  <U>Id.</U> at 3, 4.  According to the Respondent, it could
not have gathered information on the employee's outside employment
prior to reinstatement because "the employee was not yet back on
the rolls at that time and the Respondent Agency was not in
contact with the employee."  <U>Id.</U> at 4.  The Respondent further
argues that "there is a reasonable explanation" for why it took
the Respondent from July 31 to November 11 to forward the relevant
papers for the employee's backpay calculation.  <U>Id.</U>  In this
regard, the Respondent notes that "the employee was not contacted
regarding reinstatement until September 21, 1989, and did not
physically return to work until October 8, 1989."  <U>Id.</U>  The
Respondent claims that the "minor delay after that time" may be
explained by the "work involved in preparing the backpay package"
and should not be considered an unfair labor practice in light of
<U>Department of Health and Human Services and Social Security
Administration</U>, 22 FLRA 270 (1986) (<U>SSA</U>), "where a one year delay
in processing a backpay award was found reasonable."  <U>Id.</U> at 4, 5.</P>

<P>  The Respondent also requests that we reconsider our finding
that the Respondent failed to comply with the Back Pay Act and its
implementing regulations.  As a preliminary matter, the Respondent
objects to what it deems the  Authority's inappropriate
interpretation of an arbitration award which, under section
7121(f) of the Statute, is "not appealable on the merits . . . ." 
<U>Id.</U> at 6.  On the merits, the Respondent argues that the
Authority's decision in 44 FLRA 1306 "create[s] new rules for
compliance with arbitration awards ordering the payment of
backpay" and that the Respondent did not have the benefit of this
decision when calculating backpay in early 1990."  <U>Id.</U> at 7.  The
Respondent maintains that it "merely had the Backpay [sic] Act,
the implementing regulations and the Federal Personnel Manual" and
objects to the Authority's reliance on "previously unstated rules
on backpay computations[,]" including a case "on backpay [that]
had not even been decided before [the] Respondent made the backpay
calculations."  <U>Id.</U> at 7, 8 (citing <U>Blackmer v. Department of the
Navy</U>, 47 M.S.P.R. 624 (1991) (<U>Blackmer</U>)).</P>

<P>  The Respondent also requests that we reconsider our findings
on "moonlighting" earnings because "the issue was not properly
presented to the Administrative Law Judge."  <U>Id.</U> at 9 (citing 5
C.F.R. º 2429.5).  Moreover, the Respondent objects to the
Authority's finding that the employee's "job at Wal-Mart was a
'moonlighting' job which [the employee] <U>could have held</U> while he
worked for the [Respondent]."  <U>Id.</U> at 11 (emphasis in original). 
The Respondent acknowledges that "[t]he support for this holding
is a finding by [the Judge]" that was not excepted to by the
parties.  <U>Id.</U>  However, the Respondent maintains that "there was
no reason for the Respondent to file exceptions to this finding .
. . ."  <U>Id.</U>  The Respondent argues that, contrary to the Judge's
finding, "the evidence shows that [the employee] would have not
been able to work at Wal-Mart at the same time he was employed by
the [Respondent]."  <U>Id.</U>  </P>

<P>IV.    <U>Analysis and Conclusions</U></P>

<P>  Section 2429.17 of the Authority's Rules and Regulations
permits a party that can establish the existence of "extraordinary
circumstances" to request reconsideration of a decision of the
Authority.  For the following reasons, we conclude that the
Respondent has not established extraordinary circumstances within
the meaning of section 2429.17 to warrant reconsideration of our
decision in 44 FLRA 1306.</P>

<P>  We reject the Respondent's argument that it did not commit an
unfair labor practice by failing to timely process the employee's
backpay claim.  The Respondent's argument that it could not have
gathered information on the employee's outside employment prior to
reinstatement because "the employee was not yet back on the rolls
at that time"  constitutes nothing more than disagreement with our
decision and an attempt to relitigate the merits of the case. 
Motion for Reconsideration at 4.  This argument was addressed and
rejected in 44 FLRA 1306.  <U>See</U> 44 FLRA at 1315.  Moreover, the
Respondent's statement that it "was not in contact with the
employee" does not explain why it failed to contact the employee
or the Union when the award became final and why it failed to
begin gathering information on the employee's interim employment
at that time.  <U>Id.</U>  We note the Respondent's claim that it "was
seeking to have the award appealed to the courts."  <U>Id.</U>  However,
no such appeal was ever filed.  Finally, the delay in the instant
case is distinguishable from the delay in <U>SSA</U>.  Unlike the
Respondent in this case, the agency in <U>SSA</U> "did take some steps to
expedite" effectuating the award and "did act promptly enough in
starting up the process" of complying with the award.  <U>SSA</U>, 22
FLRA at 283, 284.  Accordingly, these arguments fail to
demonstrate extraordinary circumstances within the meaning of
section 2429.17 of our Rules and Regulations.  <U>See</U>, <U>for example</U>,
<U>U.S. Department of the Navy, Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth,
Virginia and National Association of Government Employees, Local
R4-19</U>, 39 FLRA 1238 (1991).</P>

<P>  We also reject the Respondent's arguments concerning its
compliance with the Back Pay Act and the implementing regulations. 
The Respondent claims that the Authority may not interpret or
order compliance with an arbitration award involving a matter
referred to in section 7121(f) of the Statute because such an
award is "not appealable on the merits . . . ."  Motion for
Reconsideration at 6.  The Authority rejected such a contention in
<U>SSA</U> and we reject it here.  <U>See</U> <U>SSA</U>, 22 FLRA at 271 n.*.  The
Respondent also claims that the Authority should not have relied
on "previously unstated rules on backpay computations[,]"
including a case "on backpay [that] had not even been decided
before [the] Respondent made the backpay calculations."  <U>Id.</U> at 7,
8 (citing <U>Blackmer</U>).  In 44 FLRA 1306, the Authority reached its
conclusion, in part, by analyzing the wording of the Back Pay Act
and its implementing regulations--legal provisions that the
Respondent acknowledges were binding at the time it calculated
backpay in this case.  The Authority also relied on
interpretations of those provisions by the MSPB (in <U>Phelps</U> and
<U>Broadnax</U>) and a Federal district court (in <U>Payne</U>) that were made
well before the Respondent calculated backpay here.  The MSPB's
decision in <U>Blackmer</U> merely restates the rules articulated in
<U>Phelps</U> and other earlier MSPB decisions, and our citation to
<U>Blackmer</U>, or to any later cases that merely restate rules
articulated in earlier  decisions, does not constitute
extraordinary circumstances warranting reconsideration of 44 FLRA
1306.</P>

<P>  Finally, we reject the Respondent's arguments with respect to
"moonlighting" earnings.  Contrary to the Respondent's argument,
we find that the issue of "moonlighting" earnings was presented in
the proceedings before the Judge within the meaning of 5 C.F.R. º
2429.5.  The Union argued in its post-hearing brief that the
Respondent improperly offset overtime wages and "wages the
employee could have earned concurrent with the desired position." 
Union's Post-Hearing Brief at 22.  To support its argument, the
Union cited various court and NLRB decisions dealing with overtime
and "moonlighting" earnings.  <U>See</U> <U>id.</U> at 18-20.  With respect to
the latter, the Union referred to the "Moonlighting Rule."  <U>Id.</U> at
18.  Moreover, the Judge was aware of this issue and rendered
findings specifically on it.  <U>See</U> 44 FLRA at 1349, 1351 (where the
Judge found that the employee's Wal-Mart job was a "moonlighting"
job, but concluded that the "Moonlighting Rule" did not apply in
this case).  In these circumstances, we find that the issue of
"moonlighting" earnings was clearly presented to the Judge.  <U>See</U>
<U>Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Administration Medical
Center, Veterans Canteen Service, Lexington, Kentucky</U>, 44 FLRA
179, 186 (1992), <U>petition for review filed as to other matters</U>,
No. 92-1185 (D.C. Cir. Apr. 24, 1992).</P>

<P>  Further, we reject the Respondent's untimely exception to the
Judge's factual finding that the employee's second, or
"moonlighting," job "'could have [been] held simultaneously with
his government job.'"  44 FLRA at 1321 (quoting Judge's Decision
at 11).  The Respondent acknowledges that it did not file an
exception to this finding in the initial proceedings before the
Authority.  Section 2423.27(b) of the Authority's Rules and
Regulations provides in part that any exception to a ruling,
finding, or conclusion of the Administrative Law Judge "which is
not specifically urged shall be deemed to have been waived."  The
Respondent does not contend that it was unable to except to the
Judge's factual finding or that it now relies on evidence which
was unavailable at the time of the initial proceedings.  The
Respondent argues only that "there was no reason for the
Respondent to file exceptions to this finding . . . ."  Motion for
Reconsideration at 11.  In these circumstances, we find that the
Respondent's untimely exception to the Judge's factual finding
does not constitute extraordinary circumstances warranting
reconsideration of our decision.</P>

<P>  In summary, the Respondent has not established extraordinary
circumstances warranting reconsideration of our decision in 44
FLRA 1306.  Accordingly, we will deny the Respondent's motion for
reconsideration.</P>

<P>V.     <U>Order</U></P>

<P>  The Respondent's motion for reconsideration of the
Authority's Decision and Order in 44 FLRA 1306 is denied.</P>
