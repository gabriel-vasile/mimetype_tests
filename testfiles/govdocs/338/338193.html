	 <P>I. <U>Statement of the Case</U></P> 
	 <P> This unfair labor practice case is before the Authority on exceptions
		to the attached decision of the Administrative Law Judge filed by the General
		Counsel and the Union. The Respondent filed an opposition to the
		exceptions.<FONT COLOR="#3333FF"><B><A HREF="#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A></B><A
		HREF="#N_1_"></A></FONT></P> 
	 <P> The complaint alleges that the Respondent violated section 7116(a)(1),
		(5), and (8) of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (the
		Statute) by failing and refusing to implement the terms of an arbitrator's
		award and engaging in unreasonable delay in implementing and complying with the
		award. The complaint also alleges that the Respondent violated section
		7116(a)(1) and (8) of the Statute by failing and refusing to implement fully
		the arbitrator's award when the Respondent failed and refused to pay backpay
		and other benefits due the grievant as required by the award. </P> 
	 <P> The Judge found that the Respondent violated section 7116(a)(1), (5),
		and (8) of the Statute by failing to comply timely with the arbitration award
		when it unreasonably delayed offering reinstatement to the employee and
		delivering the backpay check to the employee. In this regard, the Judge noted
		that "compliance with the award required contact and dialogue and [the]
		Respondent's failure and refusal to consult or negotiate in good faith with
		[the Union] also violated § [71]16(a)(5)." Judge's Decision at 15. The
		Judge further found that the Respondent violated section 7116(a)(1) and (8) of
		the Statute by failing and refusing to fully comply with the award of backpay
		when it denied the employee backpay for the 2-week period from September 24,
		1989, to October 8, 1989. However, the Judge found that the Respondent did not
		violate section 7116(a)(1), (5), and (8) of the Statute by delaying the
		processing of the employee's backpay claim; and section 7116(a)(1) and (8) of
		the Statute by deducting all of the employee's interim earnings from the
		backpay award.</P> 
	 <P> To remedy the unfair labor practices, the Judge recommended that the
		Authority issue a cease and desist Order and a Notice requiring the Respondent
		to pay the employee backpay for the 2-week period at issue together with
		interest to the date of payment. The Judge further found that damages for
		allegedly adverse tax consequences suffered by the employee were not
		warranted.</P> 
	 <P> Pursuant to section 2423.29 of the Authority's Rules and Regulations
		and section 7118 of the Statute, we have reviewed the rulings of the Judge made
		at the hearing and find that no prejudicial error was committed. We affirm the
		rulings.<FONT COLOR="#3333FF"><B><A HREF="#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A></B><A
		HREF="#N_2_"></A></FONT> Upon consideration of the Judge's decision, the
		exceptions, the opposition, and the entire record, we adopt the Judge's
		findings, conclusions, and recommended Order to the extent that they are
		consistent with this decision. No exceptions were filed to the Judge's
		conclusions that the Respondent violated section 7116(a)(1), (5), and (8) of
		the Statute. Accordingly, we adopt the Judge's conclusions and recommended
		remedy as to those matters.<FONT COLOR="#3333FF"><B><A
		HREF="#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A></B><A HREF="#N_3_"></A></FONT> </P> 
	 <P> However, contrary to the Judge, we find that the Respondent violated
		section 7116(a)(1), (5), and (8) of the Statute by failing to comply timely
		with the arbitration award when it unreasonably delayed processing the
		employee's backpay claim. Moreover, we find that the Respondent violated
		section 7116(a)(1) and (8) of the Statute by failing and refusing to comply
		fully with the arbitration award when it improperly deducted the employee's
		outside overtime and "moonlighting" earnings from the award of backpay. We will
		modify the Judge's recommended Order and Notice accordingly.</P> 
	 <P>II. <U>Background</U></P> 
	 <P> The facts of this case are not in dispute and are set out fully in the
		Judge's decision. The facts will be referenced only as needed to resolve the
		issues raised by the parties' exceptions and opposition.</P> 
	 <P>III. <U>Positions of the Parties</U></P> 
	 <P> A. <U>General Counsel's Exceptions</U></P> 
	 <P> The General Counsel excepts to the Judge's failure to conclude that the
		Respondent violated section 7116(a)(1), (5), and (8) of the Statute by
		unreasonably delaying processing the employee's backpay claim. The General
		Counsel argues that the Judge used the "wrong period of time" in concluding
		that the Respondent had not unreasonably delayed. General Counsel's Brief in
		Support of Exceptions at 2. According to the General Counsel, the Judge should
		have measured the timeliness of the Respondent's compliance with the backpay
		portion of the award from the date that the award became final, late July of
		1989, rather than from the date on which the employee was reinstated, October
		8, 1989, because the "Respondent's obligation to comply with all aspects of the
		award became effective" at the end of July of 1989. <U>Id.</U></P> 
	 <P> The General Counsel argues that the Respondent's "attitude toward this
		arbitration has been [one] of delay and avoidance" and that the "Respondent's
		motivation in the handling of the entire matter of compliance was suspect or in
		its best light not motivated by the best of intentions." <U>Id.</U> at 4, 5.
		The General Counsel contends that "the totality of [the] Respondent's actions
		show[s] unreasonable delay . . . ." <U>Id.</U> at 6. In these circumstances,
		the General Counsel maintains that the Judge should have found that the
		Respondent violated the Statute by unreasonably delaying processing the
		employee's backpay claim.</P> 
	 <P> The General Counsel also excepts to the Judge's failure to conclude
		that the Respondent violated section 7116(a)(1) and (8) of the Statute by
		failing and refusing to comply fully with the arbitration award when it offset
		the employee's interim overtime earnings against the award of backpay. The
		General Counsel asserts that it is "clear that under Comptroller General, Merit
		Systems Protection Board [MSPB], National Labor Relations Board [NLRB] and
		Federal District and Circuit Court precedent that [the employee's] outside
		overtime earnings should not have been deducted from his backpay award."
		<U>Id.</U> The General Counsel argues that the Judge erred when he "ignored the
		great weight of Federal Court and Federal administrative law precedents" which
		hold that "overtime earned during the backpay period in excess of that which
		would have been earned in the desired job should not be offset." <U>Id.</U> at
		6, 7. </P> 
	 <P> The General Counsel also argues that the Judge "misconstrued the
		Federal Personnel Manual [FPM]." <U>Id.</U> at 6. The General Counsel contends
		that the portion of the FPM relied on by the Judge "pertains only to the
		situations where an employee already had a part time job prior to their [sic]
		removal from government service" and "has no applicability here." <U>Id.</U> at
		9 (citing FPM Supp. 990-2, Book 550, Subchapter S8-7c). </P> 
	 <P> The General Counsel further argues that the Judge "misconstrued the
		applicable regulations." <U>Id.</U> Specifically, the General Counsel argues
		that the applicable regulations, 5 C.F.R. § 550.805, "do not seek to
		punish an employee by depriving that employee of overtime pay that the employee
		worked in an outside job but would not have received if the employee had been
		working for the agency." <U>Id.</U> at 10. The General Counsel argues that the
		backpay period covers the amount of time that an employee would have worked for
		the agency "and not . . . all of the time in the day." <U>Id.</U> According to
		the General Counsel, the effect of the Judge's decision is "to punish
		[employees] for their initiative and to benefit the agency for work the
		employee[s] engaged in, outside of the time they would have worked for the
		agency." <U>Id.</U> at 11. </P> 
	 <P> The General Counsel asserts that the Judge's decision creates a
		"strange disparity in Federal sector employment law." <U>Id.</U> at 12. In this
		regard, the General Counsel argues that, based on the Judge's decision, if an
		employee is reinstated by the MSPB, that employee's interim overtime earnings
		will not be deducted from the backpay award. However, the General Counsel
		maintains, "if the same employee went to an arbitrator[,] the Agency (under the
		decision of the Administrative Law Judge) could acceptably and legally deduct
		those overtime monies earned in outside employment." <U>Id.</U></P> 
	 <P> B. <U>Union's Exceptions</U></P> 
	 <P> The Union excepts to the Judge's failure to find that the Respondent's
		obligation to reinstate the employee arose on April 14, 1989, rather than in
		late July of 1989. Therefore, the Union contends that the Judge should have
		found that "since on or about April 14, 1989, [the] Respondent has violated
		section[] 7116(a)(1), (5) and (8) of the Statute by unreasonably refusing to
		immediately comply with the arbitrator's reinstatement order . . . ." Union's
		Brief in Support of Exceptions at 16.</P> 
	 <P> The Union adopts by reference the General Counsel's exception
		concerning the Judge's failure to find that the Respondent violated the Statute
		by engaging in unreasonable delay in processing the employee's backpay claim.
		However, with respect to this exception, the Union argues that the Judge should
		have found that the Respondent violated the Statute beginning on or about April
		14, 1989, rather than late July 1989.</P> 
	 <P> The Union argues that the Judge also should have found that the
		Respondent violated section 7116(a)(1) and (8) of the Statute by deducting from
		the employee's gross backpay the amount that the employee earned on interim
		overtime and the amount that he earned on his interim jobs "that he could have
		earned concurrent with working his [Agency] job." <U>Id.</U> at 31. The Union
		disputes the Judge's finding that "'the nature of [the Judge's] review renders
		immaterial decisions of the Courts and/or the [NLRB] with respect to the
		private sector, or the decisions of the [MSPB], or of Courts under the Back Pay
		Act . . . .'" <U>Id.</U> at 17-18 (quoting Judge's Decision at 24-25). </P> 
	 <P> The Union argues that in determining whether the Respondent acted
		reasonably, the Judge should have examined whether the Respondent implemented
		the arbitration award consistent with decisions of the Federal courts, the
		MSPB, the NLRB, and the Office of the General Counsel of the Comptroller
		General. According to the Union, those decisions "clearly hold that . . .
		'other employment' [as defined in 5 C.F.R. § 550.805(e)(1)] excludes
		overtime work performed for an outside employer and excludes other outside
		employment that [the employee] <U>could</U> have performed concurrent with his
		[Agency] job." <U>Id.</U> at 20 (emphasis in original). The Union notes that
		the employee in this case would not have worked overtime for the Respondent and
		that the hours that the employee worked at his two jobs during the backpay
		period "rarely overlapped with his assigned tour of duty at the [Agency]."
		<U>Id.</U> at 30. The Union maintains that, based on judicial and
		administrative precedent, the Respondent improperly deducted from the
		employee's backpay entitlement "outside overtime wages" and amounts that the
		employee "could have earned concurrent with working his [Agency] job."
		<U>Id.</U> at 27, 31. </P> 
	 <P> The Union argues that "public policy considerations demand" that the
		Authority reverse the Judge and apply the analytical framework used by the
		courts and other authorities. <U>Id.</U> at 27. Otherwise, the Union contends
		that "[i]nformed employees who understand that a back pay award from the [MSPB]
		can be worth substantially more than the same award from an arbitrator, can be
		expected to select the forum where their award is worth more." <U>Id.</U> at
		27-28. </P> 
	 <P> C. <U>Respondent's Opposition</U></P> 
	 <P> The Respondent argues that the Judge properly found that the Respondent
		did not unreasonably delay processing the employee's backpay claim. The
		Respondent contends that the arbitration award was "difficult to implement" and
		that the Respondent "attempted to prepare [the employee's] back pay check in a
		reasonable amount of time." Respondent's Opposition at 18. The Respondent
		further contends that the Judge correctly measured the Respondent's compliance
		with the backpay portion of the award from the time of the employee's
		reinstatement, October 8, 1989. According to the Respondent, the argument of
		the Union and the General Counsel that the Respondent "should have begun the
		preparation of the back pay check prior to [the employee's] reinstatement" is
		"illogical because the [Respondent] must have the employee reinstated to the
		rolls before back pay calculations can be made." <U>Id.</U> at 18-19. </P> 
	 <P> The Respondent also argues that it did not act unreasonably or in a
		manner inconsistent with applicable rules and regulations when it deducted all
		of the employee's outside income from his backpay entitlement. The Respondent
		asserts that, pursuant to the FPM, only outside income held by an employee
		"prior to separation from [F]ederal employment" is not deducted from an
		employee's backpay entitlement. <U>Id.</U> at 10 (citing FPM Supp. 990-2, Book
		550, Subchapter S8-7a and c). The Respondent maintains that the Judge correctly
		determined that the General Accounting Office (GAO) legal opinion relied on by
		the Union and the General Counsel "is not a decision of the Comptroller General
		and has been miscited by the MSPB . . . ." <U>Id.</U> at 12. According to the
		Respondent, the "Comptroller General has consistently required the offset of
		all interim earnings even when this would result in the employee being in debt
		to the government." <U>Id.</U> at 11 (citing <U>Matter of Kido</U>, 70 Comp.
		Gen. 124 (1990)). Further, the Respondent argues that the court cases relied on
		by the Union and the General Counsel have either not been adopted by the
		Comptroller General or "do not discuss payments by the [F]ederal [G]overnment
		under the Back [P]ay Act." <U>Id.</U> at 14.</P> 
	 <P> The Respondent also argues that the Union and the General Counsel have
		not met their burden of proof as they have not shown "with any specificity the
		additional amounts [of backpay] owed" to the employee. <U>Id.</U> at 9 (citing
		5 C.F.R. § 2423.18).</P> 
	 <P> IV. <U>Analysis and Conclusions</U></P> 
	 <P> A. <U>Preliminary Matter</U></P> 
	 <P> The Union excepts to the Judge's failure to find that, since on or
		about April 14, 1989, the Respondent has violated section 7116(a)(1), (5), and
		(8) of the Statute by failing and refusing to comply with the arbitration
		award. The Authority will not review allegations that are not encompassed by
		the complaint. <U>See</U> <U>U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. Immigration and
		Naturalization Service, U.S. Border Patrol, Washington, D.C.</U>, 41 FLRA 154,
		173-74 (1991); <U>U.S. Government Printing Office</U>, 23 FLRA 35, 38 (1986).
		The complaint in this case alleges that the Respondent has violated the Statute
		"[s]ince on or about July 31, 1989 . . . ." General Counsel's Exceptions,
		Exhibit 1(h) at 2, 3. We found above that the Judge acted within his discretion
		when he denied the Union's request to amend the complaint to allege that the
		Respondent violated the Statute beginning on or about April 14, 1989.
		Accordingly, as the complaint does not encompass the Union's allegation, we
		deny the Union's exception in this regard.</P> 
	 <P> B. <U>The Respondent Violated Section 7116(a)(1), (5), </U><U>and (8)
		of the Statute By Unreasonably Delaying </U><U>the Processing of the Employee's
		Backpay Claim</U></P> 
	 <P> An agency that fails to comply with an arbitration award in a timely
		manner violates section 7116(a)(1) and (8) of the Statute. <U>See</U> <U>U.S.
		Department of Treasury, Customs Service, Washington, D.C. and Customs Service,
		Region IV, Miami, Florida</U>, 37 FLRA 603 (1990) (<U>Customs Service</U>).</P>
	 
	 <P> As found by the Judge, the arbitration award ordering the employee's
		reinstatement and backpay became final in late July of 1989. Therefore, the
		Respondent was obligated to comply with the award at that time. <U>See</U>
		<U>id.</U> However, the Respondent did not reinstate the employee until October
		8, 1989. Further, the Respondent did not begin processing the employee's
		backpay claim until approximately October 18, 1989, and did not send the
		relevant papers to the Southwest Regional Office for review until approximately
		November 11, 1989. The Southwest Regional Office sent the papers to the Detroit
		Computing Center to calculate the amount of backpay and interest owed to the
		employee. The Respondent received the employee's backpay check from the Detroit
		Computing Center on February 13, 1990. </P> 
	 <P> The Judge found that the Respondent "intentionally delayed
		implementation of the award" and "had no reason whatever for its failure and
		refusal to comply promptly with the arbitration award to reinstate" the
		employee. Judge's Decision at 16. The Judge concluded that the Respondent
		violated section 7116(a)(1), (5), and (8) of the Statute by "its unreasonable
		delay in offering reinstatement as directed by the arbitrator's final award . .
		. ." <U>Id.</U> at 17. However, the Judge also concluded that the Respondent
		did not unreasonably delay preparing the employee's backpay check but "acted
		with reasonable dispatch." <U>Id.</U> at 18.<FONT COLOR="#3333FF"><B><A
		HREF="#N_4_"><SUP>(4)</SUP></A></B><A HREF="#N_4_"></A></FONT> Contrary to the
		Judge, we find that the Respondent violated section 7116(a)(1), (5), and (8) of
		the Statute by failing to comply timely with the arbitration award when it
		unreasonably delayed processing the employee's backpay claim.</P> 
	 <P> The Judge measured the Respondent's compliance with the backpay portion
		of the award from the time of the employee's reinstatement, October 8, 1989.
		The Respondent argues that the Judge correctly used October 8, 1989, as the
		date from which to measure the Respondent's compliance with the backpay portion
		of the award. We disagree. As we noted previously, the Respondent was obligated
		to comply with the arbitration award from the date that the award became
		final--on or about July 31, 1989. Having found that the Respondent unreasonably
		and intentionally delayed offering to reinstate the employee, we will not
		permit the Respondent to benefit from that delay or use that delay as a basis
		for failing to begin processing the employee's backpay claim until after the
		date of his reinstatement.</P> 
	 <P> The Respondent was obligated to implement the arbitration award by
		reinstating the employee and processing his backpay claim in a timely fashion.
		These obligations were coextensive. Just as the Respondent was obligated, as of
		July 31, to reinstate the employee as soon as possible, it was similarly
		obligated to begin processing the employee's backpay claim as soon as possible
		after July 31. The Respondent has failed to explain why it took from July 31 to
		November 11 to forward to the Southwest Regional Office the relevant papers for
		the employee's backpay calculation. In the circumstances of this case,
		particularly the Respondent's unlawful failure to reinstate the employee in a
		timely manner, the Respondent's intentional failure to begin processing the
		backpay claim until after the date of reinstatement was unreasonable and
		violated the Statute.</P> 
	 <P> We note the Respondent's argument that it "must have the employee
		reinstated to the rolls before back pay calculations can be made." Respondent's
		Opposition at 18-19. We find that the Respondent's argument does not excuse its
		failure to begin processing the employee's backpay claim in a timely fashion.
		The record indicates that on July 21, 1989, the employee completed working at
		one of the jobs held during the backpay period. The Respondent has not shown
		that it was in any way precluded from gathering information concerning that job
		once the award became final. Further, nothing in the record indicates that the
		Respondent was precluded until October 8 from gathering any information
		concerning the employee's primary job held during the backpay period. Rather,
		as found by the Judge, the Respondent chose to delay reinstating the employee.
		Had the Respondent chosen to begin gathering the relevant papers from the
		employee, or through the Union, when the award became final, it could have
		completed its processing of the backpay claim in a timely fashion. </P> 
	 <P> As the Respondent unreasonably delayed implementing the arbitration
		award and processing the backpay claim, we find that the Respondent also failed
		to comply timely with the backpay portion of the arbitration award.
		Accordingly, we conclude that the Respondent violated section 7116(a)(1) and
		(8) of the Statute. <U>See</U> <U>Customs Service</U>. Further, we conclude
		that in the circumstances of this case the Respondent failed to negotiate in
		good faith and, thus, violated section 7116(a)(5) of the Statute.</P> 
	 <P> C. <U>The Respondent Violated Section 7116(a)(1) and (8) </U><U>of the
		Statute by Improperly Deducting Certain </U><U>Earnings from the Backpay
		Award</U></P> 
	 <P> An agency that fails to comply with an arbitration award under section
		7122(b) of the Statute violates section 7116(a)(1) and (8) of the Statute.
		<U>U.S. Department of the Air Force, Carswell Air Force Base, Texas</U>, 38
		FLRA 99, 105 (1990) (<U>Carswell Air Force Base</U>). </P> 
	 <P> Whether an agency has adequately complied with an arbitration award
		depends, in part, on the clarity of the award. Where an agency disregards
		portions of an unambiguous arbitration award, the agency fails to comply with
		the award within the meaning of section 7122(b), and thereby violates section
		7116(a)(1) and (8) of the Statute. <U>See</U>, <U>for example</U>, <U>Carswell
		Air Force Base</U> (the agency failed to comply with the arbitrator's award in
		violation of section 7116(a)(1) and (8) when it failed to convert certain
		intermittent employees to regular part-time status as required by the award);
		<U>U.S. Department of Justice and Department of Justice Bureau of Prisons
		(Washington, D.C.) and Federal Correctional Institution (Danbury,
		Connecticut)</U>, 20 FLRA 39, 43 (1985) (<U>Bureau of Prisons</U>), <U>enforced
		sub nom.</U> <U>U.S. Department of Justice and Department of Justice, Bureau of
		Prisons v. FLRA</U>, 792 F.2d 25 (2d Cir. 1986) (the agency failed to comply
		with the arbitrator's award when it imposed a precondition for compliance that
		the award did not require); and <U>Department of Justice, U.S. Immigration and
		Naturalization Service, Washington, D.C.</U>, 16 FLRA 840, 842 (1984)
		(<U>INS</U>) (the agency failed to comply with the arbitrator's award by giving
		the employee 2 days' backpay when the award required the agency to provide the
		employee with 4 days' backpay). Where an arbitration award is ambiguous, the
		Authority examines whether the agency's construction of the award is reasonable
		in determining whether the agency adequately complied with the award.

		United States Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service, Austin
		Service Center, Austin, Texas</U>, 25 FLRA 71, 72 (1987). </P> 
	 <P> The arbitration award in this case provided in part that the employee
		"is to be reinstated to the position of tax examiner with backpay and
		accumulated benefits and seniority, less backpay, benefits and seniority for a
		six[-]month period commencing on the date of his discharge." Judge's Decision
		at 13. The arbitrator limited the amount of backpay only as to the date from
		which backpay was to be measured. We find that the backpay portion of the award
		is unambiguous. We note that the parties do not dispute that the amount of
		backpay provided for in the award was the full amount of backpay that the
		employee was entitled to receive for the stated time period under applicable
		laws, rules, and regulations governing backpay in the Federal sector. In these
		circumstances, the award clearly granted the employee backpay that he was
		entitled to receive under the Back Pay Act and its implementing regulations.
		Accordingly, to determine whether the Respondent disregarded the backpay
		portion of the arbitration award and thereby failed to comply with the award,
		we will examine whether, as required by the award, the Respondent calculated
		the employee's backpay entitlement consistent with the Back Pay Act and its
		implementing regulations. <U>See</U> <U>Carswell Air Force Base</U>; <U>Bureau
		of Prisons</U>; and <U>INS</U>.</P> 
	 <P> For the following reasons, we conclude that the Respondent violated
		section 7116(a)(1) and (8) of the Statute by failing and refusing to comply
		with the backpay portion of the arbitration award when it improperly deducted
		from the backpay award the employee's overtime earnings from his interim job at
		the Circle-K Corporation (Circle-K) and the employee's earnings from his
		"moonlighting" job at a Wal-Mart store.</P> 
	 <P> 1. <U>Overtime Earnings</U></P> 
	 <P> The Back Pay Act, 5 U.S.C. § 5596, provides in part that an
		employee who is entitled to backpay shall receive:</P> 
	 <BLOCKQUOTE>
		<P>an amount equal to all or any part of the pay, allowances, or
		  differentials, as applicable which the employee normally would have earned or
		  received during the period if the personnel action had not occurred, less any
		  amounts earned by the employee through other employment during that
		  period[.]</P></BLOCKQUOTE> 
	 <P>5 U.S.C. § 5596(b)(1)(A)(i). The regulations implementing the Back
		Pay Act provide in part that in computing the amount of backpay under the Back
		Pay Act and the regulations, an agency shall deduct "[a]ny amounts earned by an
		employee from other employment during the period covered by the corrective
		action . . . ." 5 C.F.R. § 550.805(e)(1). The regulations also provide
		that "[t]he agency shall include as other employment only employment engaged in
		by the employee to take the place of employment from which the employee has
		been separated by the unjustified or unwarranted personnel action." 5
     C.F.R. § 550.805(e)(2).</P> 
	 <P> The record shows that the employee was scheduled to work 40 hours a
		week at his interim job at Circle-K and that he worked overtime there as well.
		The record also shows that the employee had worked 40 hours a week for the
		Respondent and would not have worked overtime for the Respondent. <U>See</U>
		Judge's Decision at 11, 12. In determining the amount of backpay owed to the
		employee, the Respondent deducted all of the employee's Circle-K earnings,
		including overtime earnings, from the employee's gross backpay.</P> 
	 <P> Neither the Back Pay Act nor its implementing regulations specifically
		address whether or to what extent overtime earnings from interim employment may
		be deducted from an employee's backpay award. However, as noted by the Judge,
		it is "arguable" that "overtime earned in 'other employment,' where no overtime
		had been worked by [the employee] in his government employment, should not be
		deducted . . . ." <U>Id.</U> at 21. Although the Authority has not addressed
		this issue, the issue has been addressed by the MSPB. </P> 
	 <P> The MSPB has held that, under the Back Pay Act, "overtime earned during
		a period of wrongful removal <U>in</U> <U>excess</U> of that which would have
		been earned in the desired job should not be offset" against the backpay award.
		<U>Blackmer v. Department of the Navy</U>, 47 M.S.P.R. 624, 630 (1991)
		(emphasis in original) (<U>Blackmer</U>). Where overtime is not part of an
		employee's agency job, the MSPB has stated that the agency may "deduct[] from
		back pay as a result of earnings from other employment . . . only such sums as
		[the employee] may have earned during a regular forty-hour week" and not
		additional money earned as overtime. <U>Phelps v. Department of Labor</U>, 35
		M.S.P.R. 273, 277 (1987) (<U>Phelps</U>) (citing <U>Payne v. Panama Canal
		Co.</U>, 428 F. Supp. 997, 1001 (D.C. Canal Zone 1977), <U>rev'd on other
		grounds</U>, 607 F.2d 155 (5th Cir. 1979) (<U>Payne</U>)). In reaching this
		conclusion, the MSPB noted that, consistent with the reasoning of the NLRB in
		private sector cases, to allow an employer to offset excess overtime earnings
		"would create the anomaly whereby an assiduous and diligent backpay claimant
		would be penalized for toiling a long day while the shirker would be rewarded."
		<U>Phelps</U>, 35 M.S.P.R. at 276 (citing <U>United Aircraft Corp.</U>, 204
		N.L.R.B. 1068, 1073 (1973)). The MSPB reasoned that allowing an employee to
		retain "earnings from excess overtime does not make [an employee] more than
		'whole;' rather, the additional income is the result of the [employee's] extra
		effort. <U>Id.</U> (citing <U>Master Transmission Rebuilders, Inc.</U>, 269
		N.L.R.B. 93, 94 (1984) and <U>Southeastern Envelope Co.</U>, 246 N.L.R.B. 423,
		424 n.10 (1979)).</P> 
	 <P> Consistent with the above-noted reasoning, we find that under the Back
		Pay Act and its implementing regulations, an agency may deduct from an award of
		backpay the amount that the employee earned in interim employment during a
		regular workweek and the amount of overtime earned to the extent that the
		employee would have worked that amount of overtime in the agency job. If the
		employee would not have worked overtime in the agency job or would have worked
		less overtime in the agency job, the agency may not deduct from the employee's
		backpay award the excess amount of interim overtime wages that the employee
		earned. <U>See</U> <U>Blackmer</U> and <U>Phelps</U>. This reasoning is further
		supported by 5 C.F.R. § 550.805(e)(2), which provides that an agency may
		deduct from gross backpay "only [earnings from] employment engaged in by the
		employee to take the place of employment from which the employee has been
		separated by the unjustified or unwarranted personnel action[.]" Overtime hours
		in excess of what an employee would have worked for the agency do not "take the
		place of" the desired agency job. 5 C.F.R. § 550.805(e)(2). </P> 
	 <P> The Judge found that FPM Supp. 990-2, Book 550, Subchapter S8-7c
		requires the Respondent to deduct all interim earnings from the backpay award
		unless those earnings were from outside employment which the employee had
		engaged in before the unjustified absence occurred. In view of this finding and
		of early Comptroller General decisions consistent with this finding, the Judge
		concluded that decisions of the courts and the NLRB with respect to the private
		sector, as well as decisions of the MSPB and the courts under the Back Pay Act,
		were "immaterial[.]" Judge's Decision at 24. The Judge further found that the
		Union and the General Counsel improperly relied on an advisory opinion of the
		General Counsel of the GAO's Comptroller General and that the "MSPB [in
		<U>Phelps</U>] has miscited the advisory opinion [B-224073, Mar. 17, 1987]."
		<U>Id.</U> at 25 n.18. The Judge concluded that the Respondent had acted "fully
		in accord with" the Back Pay Act, the implementing regulations, the FPM, and
		the Comptroller General. <U>Id.</U> at 20.</P> 
	 <P> We noted above that we would apply the same reasoning used by the MSPB
		to determine whether an agency may deduct overtime earnings from interim
		employment from an employee's backpay award. To the extent that the Judge found
		that the MSPB improperly relied on an advisory opinion from the GAO's Office of
		the General Counsel, we disagree. The GAO General Counsel issued that opinion,
		B-224073 (Mar. 17, 1987), in response to a request from the MSPB to reexamine
		Comptroller General precedent on deducting outside overtime from backpay
		awards. The opinion from the GAO's Office of the General Counsel analyzes the
		recent public and private sector precedent on the issue and states with
		approval the underlying policy behind that precedent. The opinion notes the
		conflicting Comptroller General precedent but states that "it is not clear if
		the same result would be reached today, particularly in light of contrary
		precedent in other forums." B-224073 at 10.</P> 
	 <P> The MSPB had requested the opinion from the GAO's Office of the General
		Counsel in relation to the MSPB's decision in <U>Phelps</U>. In <U>Phelps</U>,
		the MSPB adopted the reasoning of the opinion of the GAO General Counsel,
		including the reasoning of private sector precedent discussed in that opinion.
		In these circumstances, we reject the Judge's finding that the MSPB improperly
		relied on the opinion. Moreover, the Office of the General Counsel of the GAO
		continues to follow the reasoning of the opinion. In B-233954 (Jan. 24, 1989),
		the Office of the General Counsel of the GAO states in an opinion to the U.S.
		Department of Justice that the courts, the NLRB, and the MSPB have adopted a
		"more liberal approach" than older Comptroller General cases and "have limited
		deductions from backpay to only such salary as the [employee] may have earned
		during a 40-hour week." B-233954 at 1. Further, we note that while the Judge
		and the Respondent rely on the Comptroller General's decision in <U>Matter of
		Kido</U> to support their positions, their reliance is misplaced as there was
		no allegation in that case that the employee had worked overtime in her interim
		employment. Nothing in the 1987 or 1989 opinions from the Office of the General
		Counsel of the GAO indicates that the GAO, if presented with a case involving a
		similar situation, would not apply the reasoning of those opinions. </P> 
	 <P> We also note that the Judge found that FPM Supp. 990-2, Book 550,
		Subchapter S8-7c requires the Respondent to deduct all of the employee's
		interim overtime earnings. However, the portion of FPM Supp. 990-2, Book 550,
		Subchapter S8-7c relied on by the Judge addresses the extent to which an agency
		may set off wages from gross backpay when those wages were earned in a
		part-time job that the employee held prior to the unjustified or unwarranted
		personnel action or when those wages were earned in a second part-time job
		taken as a substitute for Government employment. This subchapter of the FPM
		makes no mention of interim overtime wages. Accordingly, we find that the
		portion of FPM Supp. 990-2, Book 550, Subchapter S8-7c relied on by the Judge
		does not apply to interim overtime wages. </P> 
	 <P> We find that, consistent with the Back Pay Act and its implementing
		regulations, an agency may not deduct from gross backpay the excess amount of
		interim overtime wages that the employee earned. This position is consistent
		with the policy of private sector case law that an employer should deduct wages
		earned only from employment engaged in to take the place of the desired job and
		not wages earned as a result of an employee's extra effort. <U>See</U> <U>EDP
		Medical Computer Systems, Inc.</U>, 293 N.L.R.B. 857, 858 (1989) (the
		employee's backpay award was offset by only the first 32 hours of her weekly
		interim earnings because the employee "only worked a 32-hour week at the
		[r]espondent").</P> 
	 <P> As we noted previously, the arbitration award granted the employee
		backpay that he was entitled to receive under the Back Pay Act and its
		implementing regulations. As the employee in this case worked overtime for
		Circle-K and would not have worked overtime for the Respondent, we conclude
		that, under the Back Pay Act and its implementing regulations, the Respondent
		should not have deducted any overtime earnings--in this case, interim earnings
		over 40 hours a week--from the employee's backpay award. Having found that the
		Respondent's actions were inconsistent with the Back Pay Act and its
		implementing regulations, we find that the Respondent disregarded the backpay
		portion of the arbitration award and thereby failed to comply with the award in
		violation of section 7116(a)(1) and (8) of the Statute. <U>See</U> <U>Carswell
		Air Force Base</U>; <U>Bureau of Prisons</U>; and <U>INS</U>.</P> 
	 <P> 2. <U>"Moonlighting" Earnings</U></P> 
	 <P> The record indicates that in addition to working full-time for
		Circle-K, the employee also worked in a "moonlighting" position at a Wal-Mart
		store. The employee testified at the hearing that he did not take his position
		at Wal-Mart to replace his Agency job. <U>See</U> Transcript at 174. As found
		by the Judge, the Respondent deducted the employee's earnings from the
		employee's "work outside the hours of his government duty hours, <U>i.e.</U>, a
		second, or 'moonlighting,' job which he could have held simultaneously with his
		government job." Judge's Decision at 11. As no exceptions were filed to the
		Judge's finding, we adopt the Judge's finding that the employee could have held
		the Wal-Mart job simultaneously with his Agency job. </P> 
	 <P> As we noted previously, under 5 C.F.R. § 550.805(e)(2), an agency
		may deduct from gross backpay "only [earnings from] employment engaged in by
		the employee to take the place of employment from which the employee has been
		separated by the unjustified or unwarranted personnel action[.]" Similar to the
		rule with respect to interim overtime earnings, we find that where an employee
		works an additional ("moonlighting") job during the backpay period, earnings
		from the "moonlighting" job do not "take the place of" agency earnings within
		the meaning of 5 C.F.R. § 550.805(e)(2) to the extent that the employee
		could have held the "moonlighting" job while working for the agency. Therefore,
		like excess overtime, those earnings from a "moonlighting" job may not be
		deducted from the backpay award. <U>See</U> <U>Payne</U>, 428 F. Supp. at 1001
		(under the Back Pay Act, "[e]xtra employment that [the employee] may have
		obtained 'moonlighting' at nights or on weekends in order to survive should not
		be deductible" from the backpay award). However, "moonlighting" wages which
		could not have been earned simultaneously with the agency job are properly
		considered earnings from employment designed to "take the place of" the agency
		job. <U>See</U> <U>Broadnax v. United States Postal Service</U>, 35 MSPR 219,
		228 (1987) ("where the 'moonlighting' job could not have been held if the
		employee had obtained or remained in the position at issue, such earnings
		constitute interim earnings and must be deducted from the award"). </P> 
	 <P> Applying these principles to this case, we find that the employee's
		Wal-Mart wages should not have been deducted from gross backpay because those
		wages were "moonlighting" wages which the employee could have earned
		simultaneously with his Agency job. </P> 
	 <P> The Judge relied on the FPM and decisions of the Comptroller General in
		concluding that the Respondent properly deducted all of the employee's earnings
		from his "moonlighting" job at Wal-Mart. With respect to the FPM, the Judge
		noted that "in clear and unambiguous language[,]" FPM Supp. 990-2, Book 550,
		Subchapter S8-7c(1), provides that "<U>all earnings from outside employment be
		deducted except earnings the employee already had prior to the separation</U>."
		Judge's Decision at 23 (emphasis in Judge's Decision). As the employee had no
		outside employment prior to his separation, the Judge concluded that "<U>the
		FPM required that [the] Respondent deduct all of his outside earnings</U>,"
		including his "moonlighting" earnings. <U>Id.</U> (emphasis in original).</P> 
	 <P> We reject the Judge's interpretation of the FPM. The cited portion of
		the FPM addresses the circumstances under which an employee's outside part-time
		employment may be deducted from gross backpay. The FPM provides that a
		part-time job held prior to the unjustified or unwarranted personnel action
		does not "take the place of the Government employment." FPM Supp. 990-2, Book
		550, Subchapter S8-7c(1) (paragraph 2). The FPM further provides:</P> 
	 <BLOCKQUOTE>
		<P>If the employee was able to expand the part-time job to a full-time
		  job, or took a second part-time job, as a substitute for Government employment,
		  only those hours worked on the full-time job in excess of the aggregate of the
		  part-time job, or only the hours worked on the second job . . . are considered
		  as other employment in place of Government employment.</P></BLOCKQUOTE> 
	 <P><U>Id.</U> Following this explanation, the FPM states: "In other words,
		the only earnings from other employment that may <U>not</U> be deducted from
		backpay are earnings from outside employment the employee already had before
		the unjustified suspension or separation." FPM Supp. 990-2, Book 550,
		Subchapter S8-7c(1) (paragraph 3) (emphasis in original). This statement must
		be read in context with the remainder of that section of the FPM as well as
		with 5 C.F.R. § 550.805(e). When read in context, it is evident that the
		section of the FPM concerning set-offs for second part-time jobs applies only
		to a job that was designed to "take the place of" or that was "a substitute for
		Government employment." 5 C.F.R. § 550.805(e)(2); FPM Supp. 990-2, Book
		550, Subchapter S8-7c(1) (paragraph 2). Wages from a "moonlighting" job do not
		"take the place of" or act "as a substitute for" the agency job to the extent
		that the employee could have earned such wages simultaneously with the agency
		job. <U>Id.</U> Therefore, the cited section of the FPM does not apply to this
		case. </P> 
	 <P> With respect to the Comptroller General, the Judge and the Respondent
		cite <U>Matter of Kido</U> as support for their positions. However, there was
		no allegation in that Comptroller General decision that the employee had worked
		in a "moonlighting" job or that the agency had improperly deducted any
		"moonlighting" earnings from the backpay award. Accordingly, that decision does
		not apply to this case. </P> 
	 <P> Rather, as we noted previously, we find that an agency may not deduct
		"moonlighting" earnings from gross backpay to the extent that the employee
		could have held the "moonlighting"
		job while working for the agency.<FONT COLOR="#3333FF"><B><A
		HREF="#N_5_"><SUP>(5)</SUP></A></B><A HREF="#N_5_"></A></FONT> This rule is
		consistent with the rule applied by courts and the NLRB in the private sector.
		<U>See</U> <U>United States v. State of New Jersey</U>, 530 F. Supp. 328, 336
		(D. N.J. 1981) ("'Moonlighting' earnings of the [employee] may be used to
		offset back pay only to the extent that the employer can show that the
		[employee] would not have been able to work the second job, if he had in fact
		been hired by the employer."); <U>Teamsters Local 559</U>, 257 N.L.R.B. 24, 25
		(1981) (earnings from a "moonlighting" job held during hours that an employee
		would not have worked for the employer are not deducted from backpay).
		<U>See</U> <U>also</U> <U>Chesser v. State of Illinois</U>, 895 F.2d 330, 338
		(7th Cir. 1990) ("[w]here an employee accepts a job that he could not have
		taken if he remained in his old employment, the earnings from that job are
		interim earnings" which are deducted from the backpay award); <U>Superior
		Export Packing Co, Inc.</U>, 299 N.L.R.B. No. 9, slip op. at 10 (1990) (where
		an employee "had no supplementary job prior to the discrimination, any earnings
		from a second 'moonlighting' job during the back pay period [are] not included
		in interim earnings" and, thus, are not deducted from backpay). </P> 
	 <P> Accordingly, as the employee in this case worked in a "moonlighting"
		job for Wal-Mart which he could have held while working for the Respondent, we
		conclude that, under the Back Pay Act and its implementing regulations, the
		Respondent should not have deducted the employee's earnings from his Wal-Mart
		job. Having found that the Respondent's actions were inconsistent with the Back
		Pay Act and its implementing regulations, we find that the Respondent
		disregarded the backpay portion of the arbitration award and thereby failed to
		comply with the award in violation of section 7116(a)(1) and (8) of the
		Statute. <U>See</U> <U>Carswell Air Force Base</U>; <U>Bureau of Prisons</U>;
		and <U>INS</U>.</P> 
	 <P> 3. <U>Remedy</U></P> 
	 <P> To remedy the Respondent's unfair labor practices, we will modify the
		Judge's recommended Order and Notice to reflect that the Respondent failed to
		comply timely with the arbitration award by unreasonably delaying the
		processing of the employee's backpay claim. We will further modify the Judge's
		recommended Order and Notice to require the Respondent to reimburse the
		employee, with interest to the date of payment, for any overtime and
		"moonlighting" earnings that were improperly deducted from the backpay award.
		</P> 
	 <P> We note the Respondent's argument that the Union and the General
		Counsel have not met their burden of proof as to the specific amount of
		additional backpay owed to the employee. The Authority has consistently held,
		however, that the precise amount of backpay is determined in the compliance
		stage of the proceedings. <U>See</U>, <U>for example</U>, <U>Department of the
		Air Force, Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada</U>, 41 FLRA 1011, 1018 (1991).
		Accordingly, we reject the Respondent's argument.</P>

		Exceptions. The record is sufficient for the Authority to resolve the issues in

		Brief in Support of Exceptions at 4. Under the Authority's Rules and

		Union's request and stated "[w]e do not see any need to amend the complaint."
		Transcript at 39. We find that it was within the Judge's discretion to deny the
