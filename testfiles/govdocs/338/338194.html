           COURT HAS HELD UNDER THE HESS MECHANICAL IN THE FOURTH CIRCUIT
           1997 THAT THEY CAN FIRE THE WORKERS WHO NEGLECT THEIR JOB
           DUTIES. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO DO THE WORK FOR WHICH THEY ARE

           BE PLACED IN THEIR PERSONNEL FILES. EMPLOYERS CAN USE ALL OF

           MR. HUTCHINSON: AFTER LISTENING TO SENATOR KENNEDY, I FEEL I
           SHOULD START BY CHECKING TO SEE IF I HAVE HORNS OR THEY OUGHT
           TO BE REMOVED. I WASN'T SURE WHETHER WE WERE DEBATING MINIMUM
           WAGE, COMPTIME, DAVIS-BACON OR SUMMER JOBS PROGRAM. I KNOW THAT
           WHILE THERE'S CONCERN ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF TIME WE'RE SPENDING
           ON WHAT SENATOR KENNEDY FEELS IS AN INAPPROPRIATE BILL, THE
           TOTAL AMOUNT OF TIME DESIGNATED AND AGREED UPON IS TWO AND A
           HALF HOURS EQUALLY DIVIDED ON THIS CLOTURE MOTION. I THINK THAT

           OWNERS AND THEIR FAMILIES, THIS IS CERTAINLY WORTH TWO AND A
           HALF HOURS ON THE FLOOR OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE. AND I KNOW
           TO MANY BUSINESSES IN THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS, IT'S
           CERTAINLY WORTH THE TIME THAT WE'RE DEVOTING TO THIS SUBJECT
           TODAY. WHILE SENATOR KENNEDY MAY BE CONCERNED THAT PEOPLE HAVE
           NOT READ THE BILL, IT'S THREE AND A HALF PAGES LONG, AND I
           SUSPECT THAT ANY SENATOR BETWEEN NOW AND THIS EVENING WILL HAVE
           TIME NOT ONLY TO STUDY IT AND TO -- AND TO STUDY ITS IMPACT BUT
           ALSO PERHAPS TO READ SOME OF THE HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF

           QUOTED, A BIG PART OF THE BILL WAS NOT CITED.

           FAMILIES THAT WE REALIZE THAT SMALL BUSINESSMEN AND WOMEN IN
           THIS COUNTRY HAVE FAMILIES TOO, THAT THEY ARE WORKERS TOO. AND
           TO INVEST A LIFETIME BUILDING A SMALL BUSINESS, BUILDING JOBS
           AND ECONOMIC FUTURE FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES, TO HAVE THAT DESTROYED
           BY THIS INSIDIOUS PRACTICE IS INDEFENSIBLE. AND I'M AMAZED THAT
