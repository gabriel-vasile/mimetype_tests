April 6, 1997
My shift ended early Sunday morning, but on the other shift Greg
Linteris was going to be doing a Combustion Module experiment
on Laminar Soot Processes (the other study using the Combustion
Module) about 5:00 am. So I slept in my car for a while and came
in to watch the burn. It was spectacularly successful, and the
Principal Investigator, Prof. Jerry Faeth, was very excited. Greg
got another great burn after I went back to my hotel to sleep.

By this time, the shortened mission was official, so the
Combustion Module team worked frantically to figure out how to
get Prof. Faeth's experiment out and my experiment, Structure Of
Flame Balls At Low Lewis-number (SOFBALL), in and running in
the short time remaining.

I came in for my shift around noon, and Janice was working on the
Droplet Combustion Experiment (DCE). She had a couple of test
failures at first, then one great burn after another.

Later in the day, Roger started working to get my experiment
running, while Janice continued with DCE. Roger had not been
scheduled to do many of the combustion experiments, but with the
changes in the timeline due to the shortened mission, that's how it
worked out. Fortunately all of the Payload Specialists had been
trained to do all of the experiments, for contingencies such as this
one. Both Janice and Roger were working feverishly, foregoing
many of their scheduled break periods to get the science done.
Also, they were working in near darkness, having shut off 11 of
the 12 lights in Spacelab to save power because of the failing fuel
cell. At one point Roger said, "I really don't feel up to exercising
today, is there something I can do in the lab?" (He had a scheduled
exercise period coming up.) We suspected he was feeling fine, but
he was willing to forego even looking out the window, knowing
that his trip to space would end soon and he might never have a
chance to fly again. When we thanked him for his efforts, he
merely said "it is my privilege to be here."

Late that evening, I knew Roger would be starting the first
SOFBALL test. Needless to say, it was an anxious moment for me
knowing that the experiment I had been working toward for 13
years was about to begin. But I was busy talking to Janice and the
ground controllers for the Droplet Combustion Experiment, and
Roger didn't make a dramatic call at the start of the SOFBALL test,
so I missed the beginning. I just happened to glance over at a
monitor, and was amazed to find a downlinked video image of
three tiny flame balls perfectly motionless in the combustion
chamber. I was stunned. The burn lasted all the way until the
computer automatically shut it down 500 seconds later. I had
picked 500 seconds for the test durations because I didn't think the
burns could possibly last longer than that. I was wrong. During
that 500 second period, Janice needed to call down some DCE test
parameters, (she offered to wait until the SOFBALL burn was
done, but I felt I had to give my time to my primary job) so I
copied everything down as best as I could, still weak with
excitement.

Later Roger did another dazzling SOFBALL burn lasting about 5
minutes. I hadn't expected that mixture to burn more than 1 or 2
minutes. At the end of the shift, Roger was still volunteering to go
on, but we felt the chances of getting another good test in soon was
rather small, so we finally told him to turn the experiment off and
go to sleep.

We were planning on getting one last SOFBALL test the next
morning when Greg Linteris was on duty, but by this time the bad
fuel cell had been turned off and there was not enough electrical
power to keep the SOFBALL experiment running along with others.
I wasn't really disappointed considering the great successes
of the night before.

I came in around 11:00 am to do an interview with some folks
from the Discovery channel who were doing a special on space
flight. By the time I came in for my shift on console, most of the
crew activities involved deactivating experiments. Rumors started
floating around the POCC about a possible reflight. I didn't think
about it much, figuring that even if a reflight were to occur, it
would take a while for a decision to be made. Still, most of the
experiments on the flight worked extremely well before they had to
be shut down, so there was a strong case to be made for the
reflight.

The mission manager called another emergency meeting. A reflight
had been scheduled for July 1 of THIS YEAR. To fly in THREE
MONTHS?!?!?! No one was expecting anything like that. But you
have to give a ton of credit to the Space Shuttle program managers.
They took their responsibility to deliver a product (a 16-day
mission) to the customer (the Microgravity Science Laboratory)
very seriously, and when they didn't deliver, they accepted
responsibility seriously and offered what amounts to a heroic effort
to right the situation.

May 16, l997
Monday - Began working on making realistic lighting pictures for
flight 4a. These realistic pictures will have sunshine, Earthshine,
and have both coming from the right locations. So far all I can do
is the morning and noon Earth angles. For this flight the
International Space Station has an XPOP orbit. What is an XPOP
orbit, you say? Glad you asked. An XPOP orbit is where one side
of the Space Station always faces the Sun as it orbits around the
Earth.

From the viewpoint of the station, the Sun stays in the same spot in
the sky while the Earth goes around the Station, occasionally
blocking the Sun's view (night). This may seem complicated, but
you know of one good example. The Moon-- it always has the
same side facing the Earth. So it could be said that the Moon has an
XPOP orbit in respect to the Earth.

Tuesday - Created a semi-deployed model of the International
Space Station's Radiator. The radiator on the Station performs the
same function as the radiator of a car. Its radiator just happens to
work in space. The radiator helps cool the Station down. Since
there are huge temperature extremes (super hot +300 degrees) on
the sunlit sides compared to the (-200 degrees) side not facing the
Sun, the vital instruments need lots of insulation so the inside stays
at a nice comfortable temperature. All the insulation means that the
equipment does not heat up much in the Sun and does not cool
down when in the dark. It's a temperature shield. However, using
the equipment heats up the equipment and the astronauts. The heat
cannot get out of the insulation and the external heat or cold can not
get in. That is why the radiator becomes very important to cool the
equipment and keep the Station from boiling over.

Wednesday - Completed the pictures using the partially deployed
radiator. I also got the Sun and Earth angles for the afternoon part
of the orbit. All the people in the lab went to the Co-op
presentations of what they were doing for the semester. It was all
interesting and we got snacks at the end of the presentation.

Thursday - Began running the afternoon pictures of the installation
of the truss on F4A. I also put a musical soundtrack to the VCR
tape of my bosses' version of the animation.

Friday - Began adding text and brief descriptions on the time of
day and which camera they are using to the pictures I made. These
pictures will help the mission planners know what is to be
expected, because nobody wants to be faced with a surprise that far
from home.

      <P><B>STATUS OF STS-94 PROCESSING</B><BR>
      <P> 
      <PRE>
Below and in the future, we'll provide some details about the
post flight work being done after STS-83 and the subsequent
processing of Columbia as it gets ready to fly again as STS-94.
These reports will contain jargon and unfamiliar terms; our intent
is not to confuse you, but to provide a glimpse at all the steps
involved. Detailed daily reports about Columbia's processing can
be found at the NASA Shuttle Status web site at
<A HREF="http://www-pao.ksc.nasa.gov/kscpao/status/status.htm">http://www-pao.ksc.nasa.gov/kscpao/status/status.htm</A>

Since the last updates-sto message, Columbia's midbody umbilical
unit used to load cryogenic reactants aboard the orbiter was
connected. The helium signature leak test was completed and
loading of storable hypergolic propellants aboard Columbia was
begun.

Tile installation work on the forward reaction control system is
complete, with all 36 tiles bonded to the vehicle. Bond verification
checks will begin after the loading of hypergolic propellants is
complete.

The STS-94 Flight Readiness Review was held. Afterwards, NASA
managers announced July 1 as the official launch date for Columbia's
reflight of the Microgravity Science Laboratory-1 mission.

In Columbia's aft compartment, work to install the fabricated "pyro
can" assemblies at the orbiter's external tank attach points was
scheduled to conclude on June 21.

STS-94 SCHEDULED OPERATIONAL MILESTONES (dates are target only):
- Ordnance installation (June 24)
- Orbiter aft engine compartment close-outs (June 23)
- Launch countdown begins (June 28)
