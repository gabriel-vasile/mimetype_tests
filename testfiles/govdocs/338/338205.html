      <p>NCI cancer researcher Dr. Luigi De Luca gets a ton of unreported
        income from an approved outside activity, and finds it so
        rewarding that he shows up at his moonlighting job 8 times
        a week &#8212; every weekday morning, Monday and Wednesday
        afternoons and Sunday mornings. </p>
      <p><i>Continued...</i></p>
      <p>The income isn't money, though. It's the satisfaction of
        introducing parochial school kids to the joys of Latin. </p>
      Sure, De Luca gets paid a modest salary by Our Lady of Lourdes
      Catholic Church in downtown Bethesda, and his work there, he
      chuckles, is officially copacetic. But pay is not what prompts
      him to report there so often, sometimes twice a day. He goes
      because the classics &#8212; Latin and Greek &#8212; were the
      love of his early education in Maglie, Italy. He very nearly
      chose languages over biochemistry when, at age 18, as an applicant
      to the University of Pavia, he had to declare his major.</p>

Some 40 years later, he has returned to graduate school,
        earned a master's degree in the classics and is now a much-loved instructor to several dozen
      Lourdes sixth, seventh and eighth graders enrolled in Latin
      I, Latin II and the school's Latin Club. His "outside income" these
      days is largely inner, or psychic.
            <p></p>They get it," he enthuses, "although sometimes it's hard.
        What excites them most is an appreciation that many words
        in English are derived from Latin roots. That word 'appreciation,'
        for example &#8212; it comes from 'pretium,' meaning 'price
        or value.'" </td>

      <p>De Luca had a scarce knowledge of English when, in 1965,
        he came from Italy &#8212; where he had earned a doctorate
        in biological chemistry from the University of Pavia &#8212; to
        accept a research and teaching post at MIT. "My language background
        was French, Italian, Latin and Greek," he recalls. "My English
        when I came here was not very good."</p>
      <p>While De Luca and his wife, whom he had met at Pavia, did
        not plan on remaining in the United States, he nonetheless
        applied himself assiduously to the study of English. "To me,
        languages are very, very important," he declares. "I started
        to learn English at the University of Pavia, from an exchange
        student from the University of Oregon at Eugene. It was my
        first exposure to a non-Romance language." Fortunately for
        him, "about 60 percent of English words derive from Latin
        or Greek." He would tape posters of English words and phrases
        to the walls of his Cambridge, Mass., apartment. "It took
        me a relatively short time &#8212; I made it a priority, and
        Latin helped." </p>
      <p>Within 6 months of his arrival in the U.S., De Luca had his
        first dream in English. "This is very significant," he asserts. "Either
        it's a nightmare, or you really have absorbed it," he says
        with a laugh. </p>
      <p>The De Lucas grew fond of the international atmosphere at
        MIT &#8212; his peers were from Egypt, Israel, Lebanon, Austria,
        Korea and Italy &#8212; and decided to remain in the U.S.
        when Luigi was offered a job at the National Cancer Institute.
        In 1971, he came to Bldg. 37, rising to the level of chief
        of the differentiation control section in the Laboratory of
        Cellular Carcinogenesis and Tumor Promotion. "I've always
        been at NCI, and always in Bldg. 37. I'm an affectionate,
        addicted inhabitant," he says. A nutritional biochemist, he
        studies vitamin A and retinoids, and the role that essential
        nutrients play in the inhibition of cancer development. </p>
      <p>While he is only too anxious to describe the role of the
        RXR-alpha receptor in breast cancer biology, or a new retinoid-metabolizing
        enzyme of the cytochrome P-450 type, the arc of De Luca's
        long scientific career is turning inexorably to his roots
        in Maglie (pronounced MALL-ya), a town at the tip of the "heel" of
        Italy where the regional dialect &#8212; itself an echo of
        the Latin of antiquity &#8212; is dying away within his generation. "I'm
        very attached to my home town," he admits; his parents, now
        in their nineties, only recently left Maglie for Pavia, to
        be cared for by his siblings.</p>
      <p>De Luca had already taken 8 years of Latin and 5 years of
        Greek by the time he completed his "Liceo," or lyceum years
        at the Liceo Capece of Maglie. At 18, he had a career choice:
        languages or science.</p>

      <p>"In the old Italian system, one could start school at age
        5 and by 18 you had done so much memorizing and had fought
        your way through the logic of classical languages, philosophy
        as well as literature, history, art, math and sciences," he
        recalls. "It was a no-nonsense approach that allowed one to
        reach a maturity much beyond one's age, with a final national
        exam the likes of which I have never encountered anywhere.
        In fact, the degree you earn out of the Liceo is called a
        'maturity' degree. This training permitted one to enter any
        field of university specialization." </p>
      <p>The eldest of four, all of whom have chosen careers in the
        sciences, De Luca picked the chemistry-biochemistry curriculum,
        in which he also had a strong interest "in part because my
        father had the concept that you could make a better living
        [in science]." </p>
      <p>Skip ahead several decades to 1999. "After 40 years of biomedical
        science, I decided I really wanted to go back to my classics,
        to kind of crown a dream." Convinced that he needed a formal
        education in Latin, he enrolled at the University of Maryland's
        evening college, in the department of classics. "Something
        told me that I had to go back and finish," he says. </p>
      <p>Due to his earlier studies in Italy, De Luca was accepted
        at the master's level, taking courses one night a week from
        5 to 8. "It took me 3 years and 3 months, studying always
        at night, to earn my master's," which he obtained in 2002. </p>
      <p>"Latin never leaves you," he observes. "It's like biking
        or swimming &#8212; you never stop knowing. If a language
        hits you at a young enough age, it's imprinted. You dust it
        off, and it comes back as shiny as it was."</p>

      <p>For De Luca, the classics slake an intellectual thirst that
        lies outside of science, but shares with it the need for a
        logical approach. "It's a process of continuous discovery &#8212; it's
        very exciting for me to go back and reconnect with the ancients."</p>
      <p>When Our Lady of Lourdes approached the classics department
        at Maryland in search of a Latin teacher, De Luca got the
        recommendation. He began in September 2003, teaching 25 kids
        who meet from 7:30 to 8 a.m. every weekday, then two afternoons
        from 3:15 to 4:15. As if that weren't enough, he also teaches
        300-level Latin to graduate students at the University of
        Maryland one night a week. "My life is pretty much in Latin
        right now," he chuckles. </p>
      <p>His Lourdes students are excited to know that as simple a
        word as "exit," is "lifted right out of Latin," says De Luca. "They
        say, 'My God, this is real!' They love the application to
        modern language." </p>
      <p>De Luca also runs an hour-long Latin Club on Sunday mornings,
        right after the 10:30 Mass. "They don't bring textbooks &#8212; we
        analyze words, English ones with Latin roots."</p>
      <p>De Luca is also proud of his role as president of the Italian
        Cultural Society of Washington, D.C., which runs an Italian
        language program. For this and for his involvement in building
        up a scholarship program to help young students in the Washington
        metropolitan area, he was knighted by the Italian government
        in 2002. His wife is a professor of Italian at the Foreign
        Service Institute, and also teaches Italian on weekends at
        Casa Italiana in the District.</p>
      <p>The weekends afford him time for his few non-scholarly pursuits &#8212; cycling
        (he is a long-time daily bike commuter to NIH), especially
        along the Capital Crescent Trail and in Rock Creek Park, and
        babysitting granddaughters Annabel and Olive. For vacations,
        he often returns to Italy to visit his parents and siblings.</p>
      <p>It is on these returns to Pavia that he realizes how sweet
        life was when &#8212; as a student at the University of Pavia
        and a resident at the Collegio Cairoli (an "honors" scholar
        residence for Italy's brightest students) &#8212; he lived
        in his own room within an ancient building, and enjoyed daily
        maid and meal service. "I didn't appreciate it fully until
        I left," he muses. </p>
      Considering his current workload, he decides, "Maybe I will
        retire." But if and when retirement comes, it won't be idle. "I
        plan to teach Latin. And I may earn another degree in the
        classics."
