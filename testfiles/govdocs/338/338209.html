			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">By&nbsp; Sen. Patrick 
			Leahy and Sen. Robert Menendez <br>
			<br>
			The need for international cooperation to crack down on drug cartels 
			is beyond question. Just a few weeks ago, gunmen killed Mexico Chief 
			of Police Edgar Eusebio Millán Gómez in his home. In a single week, 
			more than 100 people, including about 20 police officers, were 
			killed in drug-related violence. Some of those suspected of having a 
			hand in these crimes are police officers themselves, moonlighting 
			for the cartels. <br>
			<br>
			On May 22, the U.S. Senate approved $450 million for the first 
			tranche of a $1.4 billion, three-year program the administration has 
			called the Merida Initiative, a public security partnership between 
			the United States and Mexico and the Central American countries to 
			combat drug trafficking and related violence and organized crime. In 
			the coming days, Congress will finalize the package as part of the 
			2008 supplemental appropriations bill. The program includes 
			intelligence sharing, dramatically higher funding for law 
			enforcement and some support for judicial institutions and civil 
			society. <br>
			<br>
			Critics have chosen to interpret Congress's actions as ''sending the 
			wrong signal'' to our neighbors. In Mexico, some have even suggested 
			that any strings on U.S. taxpayer aid would be an unacceptable 
			''infringement of sovereignty.'' Mexican President Felipe Calderón 
			has made a welcome gesture in reaching out to the United States for 
			our help, but we reject the false choice of either ''abandoning 
			Mexico'' or funding the administration's plan with a blank check.
			<br>
			<br>
			Getting the Merida Initiative right starts with recognizing where it 
			falls short. <br>
			<br>
			&#8226; First, while President Bush would provide more than 90 percent of 
			the funds to Mexico -- a ten-fold increase over the current level -- 
			the problems of transnational drug trafficking and organized crime 
			are regional. We have already seen the so-called ''balloon effect'' 
			as cartels in Mexico have moved south to Guatemala. <br>
			<br>
			&#8226; Second, law enforcement training and hardware, which would receive 
			the overwhelming bulk of U.S. funds, are incapable by themselves of 
			solving these problems in the long term. Any effective strategy must 
			also address the structural and societal causes that have allowed 
			drug trafficking, violent crime and corruption to flourish in Mexico 
			and Central America. We recognize that the region needs properly 
			trained and equipped police forces. But civilian justice authorities 
			and public institutions are the primary instruments to solve these 
			problems over time. For far too long, members of the security forces 
			of these countries have violated human rights with impunity, further 
			fueling a breakdown in law and order. <br>
			<br>
			&#8226; Third, drug trafficking is an issue of supply and demand. We all 
			know that the United States is a principle market for illegal drugs 
			and that weapons from the United States end up in the hands of the 
			cartels in the region. Therefore, to make Merida work, we need to 
			reduce the violence and the trafficking, but we need to also focus 
			on our side of the border as well. <br>
			<br>
			While the Senate strives to address other competing needs such as 
			humanitarian aid for the people of Burma, Iraq and Africa, we will 
			provide hundreds of millions of U.S. taxpayer dollars for the Merida 
			Initiative. Not only is this the majority of what the president 
			requested, but we will also expand the initiative to include Haiti 
			and the Dominican Republic as well as investments for economic and 
			social development in Central America. [The House passed its version 
			of the Merida Initiative on Tuesday by a vote of 311 to 106.] <br>
			<br>
			Congress is not going to ''abandon'' Mexico. Instead, we want to 
			help shape the Merida package to put the rule of law, human rights 
			and accountability at the forefront. We also need criteria for 
			measuring progress. As we have learned from previous failed 
			strategies to combat drugs, unless we address the widespread poverty 
			that engulfs these countries, this effort will fail. <br>
			<br>
			No one supports the goals of the Merida Initiative more than we do. 
			Cracking down on drug trafficking and violence -- and building 
			closer relations with Mexico and Central America in the process -- 
			are as important to Americans as they are to our southern neighbors. 
			But to succeed, we must work together to craft short- and long-term 
			solutions that meet our mutual security needs while building the 
			institutions of justice that are so crucial for long-term success.
