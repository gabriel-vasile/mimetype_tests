     Solely for the purposes of this proceeding and any other
proceedings brought by or on behalf of the Commission or to which
the Commission is a party, prior to a hearing pursuant to the
Commission's Rules of Practice, and without admitting or denying
the facts, findings, or conclusions herein, Greifeld consents to
entry of the findings, and the imposition of the sanctions set
forth below.


                          III.  FINDINGS

     The Commission makes the following findings:-[2]-

A.   The Respondent

     Greifeld, age 35, was licensed to practice public accounting
by the State of New York in 1988.  His registration lapsed in
1990, and was reinstated in 1996 retroactive to 1990.  He is
currently employed as the Vice President of Finance at a non-
public company.

B.   Background

     Greifeld served as the independent accountant for A.S.
Goldmen & Co., Inc. ("Goldmen") for the audit years ending
December 31, 1989-1991 and for Middlegate Securities, Ltd.
("Middlegate") for the audit years ending December 31, 1989-92. 
Both Goldmen and Middlegate are broker-dealers registered with
the Commission and file annual reports on Form X-17A-5.  

     The Commission requires that annual reports on Form X-17A-5
include financial statements audited by an independent public
accountant and an audit report issued by the accountant stating
his opinion as to whether the audit was made in accordance with
generally accepted auditing standards ("GAAS").  17 C.F.R.
240.17a-5(d) and (i).  The Commission further requires that the
accountant conducting the audit "shall in fact be independent,"
17 C.F.R. 240.17a-5(e)(1)(i), and that the audit "include all
procedures necessary under the circumstances to enable the
independent public accountant to express" his opinion.  17 C.F.R.
240.17a-5(g)(1).  Compliance with the requirements of Rule 17a-5
"is a keystone of the surveillance of registered broker-dealers
with which [the Commission is] charged in the interest of
affording protection to investors . . ."  In re W.E. Leonard &
Co., Inc., 39 S.E.C. 726, 727 (1960).  

     Greifeld became the independent accountant for the two

Settlement submitted by Greifeld and are not binding on any other
person or entity.
==========================================START OF PAGE 3======

broker-dealers as a result of a request by Monte S. Colbert, an
accountant and former co-worker.-[3]-  In 1989, Colbert
asked Greifeld to be identified as the independent public
accountant for Goldmen and Middlegate.  Colbert told Greifeld
that he wanted Greifeld to be the accountant designated on the
audit reports because Colbert was not yet certified and because
his employer discouraged moonlighting.  

     Greifeld and Colbert entered into an arrangement whereby
Colbert conducted the field work for the audits of the broker-
dealer firms and prepared workpapers.  Once a year, Colbert
brought his workpapers to Greifeld's home, where Greifeld spent
several hours reviewing the workpapers.  Greifeld thereafter
signed the audit reports, stating his opinion that the financial
statements presented fairly the financial condition of the
broker-dealers, and representing that the audits were conducted
in accordance with GAAS. 
 
     Greifeld never met with any of the principals of Goldmen or
Middlegate in connection with becoming their independent
accountant.  Nor did he meet with any of the principals in
connection with his audit work.  Greifeld did not receive any
compensation from either Goldmen or Middlegate.  Goldmen and
Middlegate each paid Colbert several thousand dollars each year
and Colbert, in turn, paid Greifeld the nominal sum of $150 per
audit for his services.  

     On September 1, 1990, Greifeld's registration to practice
accounting lapsed.  At the time that Greifeld signed the 1991 and
1992 Middlegate audit reports and the 1991 Goldmen audit report,
he had not taken action to ensure that his registration was
current for the years in question.

     Near the end of 1991, Colbert approached Goldmen about
becoming a broker at the firm.  Goldmen agreed to sponsor Colbert
for the licensing examination given by the National Association
of Securities Dealers, Inc. ("NASD").  Colbert was hired by
Goldmen to become a salesperson on January 13, 1992, and he
passed the NASD's Series 7 examination on February 5, 1992.  At
the time of these events, Colbert was engaged on Goldmen's 1991
audit.

     Greifeld never inquired whether Colbert knew of any facts
and circumstances that might have impaired Colbert's independence

---------FOOTNOTES----------
     -[3]-      Colbert   consented  to  issuance  of   an  order
permanently denying him the  privilege of appearing or practicing
before the  Commission pursuant to Rule  102(e)(1)(ii), 17 C.F.R.
201.102(e)(1)(ii).   In  the Matter  of Monte  S.  Colbert, CPA,

as an auditor.  Nor did Greifeld inquire whether Colbert had any
relationship with Goldmen apart from his work on the audits.  As
a result, he failed to discover Colbert's employment by Goldmen.

C.   Greifeld Engaged in Improper Professional Conduct

     Greifeld "engaged in unethical or improper professional
conduct," within the meaning of Rule 102(e)(ii) of the
Commission's Rules of Practice, in connection with the 1991 audit
of Goldmen and the 1991 and 1992 audits of Middlegate.  First,
his participation in the audits of both clients was not
sufficient for him to assure that proper audit procedures
required by GAAS were employed.  Specifically, Greifeld failed to
comply with several of the tenets of GAAS, including all of the
standards of field work and the requirement that he exercise due
care in the performance of the audit.  Second, he failed to
comply with Rule 17a-5 and GAAS when he did not perform
reasonable procedures to ensure that Colbert was independent
during the 1991 audit of Goldmen.  Third, he was not at the time
he signed the audit reports registered as an accountant as
required by Rule 17a-5(f).-[4]-

     1.   Greifeld Failed to Participate Meaningfully in the 
          Audits and to Assure that Proper Audit Procedures Were
          Employed                                              

     As the designated independent accountant for Goldmen and
Middlegate, Greifeld had the ultimate responsibility for assuring
that their audits were conducted in accordance with GAAS.  This
includes the responsibility for planning, supervising, and
reviewing the audit work, and for ensuring that appropriate
auditing standards were applied.  Greifeld's role in the audits,
under his arrangement with Colbert, was not sufficient to fulfill
these obligations.  

     GAAS requires that certain standards of field work be
maintained.  The three basic standards are:  1) the audit work is
to be adequately planned and assistants, if any, are to be
properly supervised; 2) a sufficient understanding of the
internal control structure is to be obtained to plan the audit

---------FOOTNOTES----------
     -[4]-     The Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Rule
102(e)  of the Commission's Rules of Practice did not allege that
the Goldmen and Middlegate financial statements on which Greifeld
stated  an opinion were materially  misstated.  The  absence of a
material   misstatement,  however,  does  not  excuse  Greifeld's
failure  to  conduct the  audits in  accordance  with GAAS.   The
purpose  of the audit is to provide reasonable assurance that the
financial  statements  are  free of  material  misstatement,  and
unless  the  audit  is  conducted  in  accordance  with  GAAS  as
represented, the utility of the auditor's opinion is compromised.
==========================================START OF PAGE 5======

and to determine the nature, timing, and extent of tests to be
performed; and 3) sufficient competent evidential matter is to be
obtained through inspection, observation, inquiries, and
confirmations to afford a reasonable basis for an opinion
regarding the financial statements under audit.  Codification of
Statement on Auditing Standards, ("AU") Section 150.  In
addition, GAAS requires that an auditor exercise due professional
care in the performance of an audit.  AU  150, 230.  The
standard of due case imposes "a responsibility . . . to observe
the standards of field work and reporting."  AU  230.02.

     a.   General Deficiencies

     The field work performed on the audits, as documented in the
workpapers prepared by Colbert and reviewed by Greifeld, was not
sufficient to support Greifeld's expression of an opinion on the
financial statements of Goldmen and Middlegate.  The workpapers
contain no documentation of Greifeld's planning, supervision and
review of the audits.  See AU  150, 311, 319.  The workpapers
in addition contain virtually no evidence of the application of
auditing procedures as required by GAAS.  The workpapers do not
contain documentation that sufficient competent evidential matter
was obtained concerning: 1) the completeness of the balances for
liabilities; 2) the completeness and proper presentation of
revenues; 3) the completeness and proper presentation of material
expenses, including payroll, commissions, and occupancy costs; 4)
the existence, or financial statements effects of, significant
agreements or contracts; and 5) the existence, or financial
statements effects of, contingencies.

     In addition to these general deficiencies, Greifeld's
conduct resulted in the following two specific failures in the
audits:

     b.   Failure to Evaluate Internal Controls

     Commission Rule 17a-5(g) specifically requires that the
audit of a broker-dealer include an evaluation of the firm's
internal accounting control.  The understanding of the internal
control structure must be sufficient to provide reasonable
assurance that any material inadequacies existing at the date of
the examination are disclosed.  As noted above, GAAS also
requires that an auditor obtain a sufficient understanding of the
internal control structure, and that the auditor document his
understanding.  AU 150, 319.  

     The workpapers prepared by Colbert and reviewed by Greifeld
do not reflect the auditors' understanding or evaluation of the
systems of internal controls of Goldmen or Middlegate.  Without
such documentation, Greifeld could not assess the risk that the
firms' internal control structures were sufficient to prevent or
detect misstatements in the recording of transactions or to
==========================================START OF PAGE 6======

permit identification of material misstatements in the financial
statements. 

     c.   Failure to Audit the Value of Marketable Securities

     Greifeld failed to require that Colbert obtain sufficient
competent evidence concerning the value and presentation of
marketable securities on Goldmen's 1991 financial statements. 
First, as evidence of the value of Goldmen's marketable
securities, Colbert obtained only a statement from the firm's
clearing broker, and did not attempt to obtain assurance that the
clearing broker's statement was supported by either independent
market price reports or by a report from the clearing broker's
auditor.  Greifeld should have recognized that the evidence
obtained by Colbert was inadequate and required Colbert to obtain
additional evidence.

     Second, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP")
normally require the recording of securities transactions and
balances as of the trade date, not the settlement date, unless
the difference is not material.  See AICPA Audit and Accounting
Guide - Audits of Brokers and Dealers in Securities.  The
evidence that Colbert obtained and Greifeld reviewed regarding
the transactions and balances consisted of the statement of the
clearing broker, which listed these items on a settlement date
basis.  The workpapers contain no evidence that Greifeld
considered the possible effect on the financial statements of
adjusting the balances and transactions to a trade date basis.

     Third, on Goldmen's 1991 financial statements, certain short
securities positions are netted against the value of long
securities positions.  The presentation is not in accordance with
GAAP.  GAAP requires that the value of securities sold but not
yet purchased, unless hedged, be shown as a liability, and not
netted against the value of long securities positions.  Id. 
Greifeld should have required that Goldmen's marketable
securities be presented in accordance with GAAP on its 1991
financial statements.

     2.   Greifeld Failed to Perform Reasonable Procedures to
          Ensure that All Personnel Working on the Audit were
          Independent

     Rule 17a-5(e)(1)(i) requires that the independent accountant
conducting the audit of a broker-dealer "shall in fact be 
==========================================START OF PAGE 7======

independent."-[5]-  GAAS also requires that an auditor, and
persons working on the audit, be independent.  See AU 150.02. 
The Commission has made clear that this requirement "is critical
to the Commission's reporting process and to the securities
markets which the Commission regulates."  In re Iommazzo,
Exchange Act Release No. 31726, AAER No. 437, 53 SEC 870, 875,
Admin. Proc. File No. 3-7740 (Jan. 12, 1993).

     An auditor must establish quality control procedures
designed to provide reasonable assurance that all persons working
on the audit maintain the required independence.  See AU 161.03;
QC 10.07.a.  These procedures must be designed to identify the
facts and circumstances relating to any independence issues so
that the conclusions reached by assistants relating to such
issues can be reviewed.

     Colbert lacked independence once he became an employee of
Goldmen during the 1991 audit.  Regulation S-X, 2-01(b), 17
C.F.R. 210.2-01(b).  In addition, Colbert's concurrent
engagement as the auditor and a broker was incompatible with the
practice of public accounting.  Codification of Financial
Reporting Releases 602.02.e.iii.  Colbert's independence was
impaired from the time he first considered, but did not reject,
employment by Goldmen.  See AICPA Ethics Ruling 77.  

     Greifeld did not learn of Colbert's lack of independence
because he failed to make any inquiry, much less establish
procedures to ensure that Colbert maintained independence. 
Greifeld should have asked Colbert, and documented, whether
Colbert had any relationship with Goldmen, other than as auditor.

It was not sufficient for Greifeld simply to assume that Colbert
was independent, or to assume that Colbert would reach
appropriate conclusions concerning independence issues, because
these are not procedures that provide the reasonable assurance
required by GAAS.  If Greifeld had fulfilled his responsibility
to establish appropriate procedures, he would have discovered
Colbert's independence problem.  He then should have removed
Colbert from the 1991 audit of Goldmen.  Having failed to do so,
he was precluded from expressing an opinion on the broker-
dealer's 1991 financial statements, because "any procedures he
might perform would not be in accordance with" GAAS as a result
of the impairment of Colbert's independence.  AU  504.09.  

---------FOOTNOTES----------
     -[5]-   The rule adopts  the standards for  independence set
forth  in Sections 2-01(b) and  (c) of Regulation  S-X, 17 C.F.R.
210.2-01(b)  and  (c), which  governs the  form and  contents of
financial  statements  filed  with  the Commission.    17  C.F.R.
240.17a-5(f)(3).  Regulation S-X, 2-01(b) specifically provides
that  the  Commission  will   not  consider  a  certified  public
accountant independent if  during the period of  engagement he is
an employee of the audit client.
==========================================START OF PAGE 8======

     3.   Greifeld Was Not at the Time He Signed the Audit 
          Reports Registered as an Accountant             

     Rule 17a-5(f), 17 C.F.R. 240.17a-5(f), states that in
connection with reports filed by a broker-dealer, the Commission
will not recognize as a certified public accountant any person
who is not registered in good standing to practice accounting. 
Greifeld's registration to practice accounting in the state of
New York lapsed in 1990.  Greifeld took no action to renew his
registration until 1996, when he renewed his registration
retroactive to 1990.  Thus, he was not registered in good
standing to practice accounting at the time he signed the 1991
and 1992 audit reports at issue.  


                  IV.  ORDER IMPOSING SANCTIONS

     Based on the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate
and in the public interest to accept the Offer of Settlement
submitted by the Respondent and accordingly,
     
        IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, effective immediately, that:
     
        1.  Greifeld is denied the privilege of appearing or
practicing before the Commission as an accountant.
     
        2.  After two years from the date of this order, Greifeld
may apply to the Commission by submitting an application to the
Office of the Chief Accountant which requests that he be
permitted to resume appearing or practicing before the Commission
as a preparer or reviewer, or a person responsible for the
preparation or review, of financial statements of a public
company to be filed with the Commission upon submission of an
application satisfactory to the Commission in which Greifeld
undertakes that, in his practice before the Commission, his work
will be reviewed by the independent audit committee of the
company for which he works or in some other manner acceptable to
the Commission.
     
        3.  After five years from the date of this Order,
Greifeld may apply to the Commission by submitting an application
to the Office of the Chief Accountant which requests that he be
permitted to resume appearing or practicing before the Commission
as an independent accountant upon submission of an application
containing a showing satisfactory to the Commission that:
     
        (a).   Greifeld, or any firm with which he is or becomes
associated in any capacity, is and will remain a member of the
SEC Practice Section of the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants Division for CPA Firms ("SEC Practice
Section") as long as he appears or practices before the
Commission as an independent accountant; 
==========================================START OF PAGE 9======

     
        (b).   Greifeld or the firm has received an unqualified
report relating to his or the firm's most recent peer review
conducted in accordance with the guidelines adopted by the SEC
Practice Section; and 
     
        (c).   Greifeld will comply with all applicable SEC
Practice Section requirements, including all requirements for
periodic peer reviews, concurring partner reviews, and continuing
professional education, as long as he appears or practices before
the Commission as an independent accountant.
     








        4.  The Commission's review of any request or application
by Greifeld to resume appearing or practicing before the
Commission may include consideration of, in addition to the
matters referenced above, any other matters relating to
Greifeld's character, integrity, professional conduct, or
qualifications to appear or practice before the Commission.
