In Brief
January-February 2007 Issue
Braille Book Review and Talking Book Topics

The following information is reprinted from an issue of NLS Flash, a 
newsletter created to bring current information on NLS progress in 
digital technology to patrons, library staff, and other interested 
individuals.

Flash, October 2006, volume 2, issue 11						

Functional prototype usability tests successful 
The National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped 
(NLS), Library of Congress, has completed initial usability testing on 
functional prototypes for the digital talking-book player and flash 
memory cartridge. In September, twenty-six patrons from the Library for 
the Blind and Physically Handicapped in Rocky Hill, Connecticut, 
conducted hands-on examinations of the functional prototypes. The tests 
were designed to evaluate how well the machine meets patron 
requirements. All participants were pleased with machine performance, 
providing NLS clearance to advance to the next stage of development.
	"Our patrons' positive evaluation is an encouraging validation of 
the design at this stage. The feedback received from these tests will 
keep development of the digital player moving in the right direction," 
says Frank Kurt Cylke, NLS director.  
	Both blind and physically impaired patrons of various ages and 
abilities participated in the usability tests. To collect useful and 
accurate data about machine performance, the testing took place in 
real-life settings where reading would typically occur. Users evaluated 
the machine in diverse environments, including their homes, retirement 
centers, and at the library.  Patrons with physical challenges 
evaluated the machines at the Trace Research and Development Center in 
Madison, Wisconsin, where they subjected players to tests similar to 
those conducted by blind users.
	"Children, teens, adults, and seniors with both advanced and 
basic skills were all accounted for during testing. Some patrons 
evaluated functional prototypes for basic players, while others 
examined the more intricate features of the advanced machine," notes 
Connecticut regional librarian Carol Taylor, who recruited participants 
for the usability tests. 

Functional design
A product's functionality and its ease-of-use are often affected by its 
design. To assess how functional the prototype's design was, 
participants evaluated a range of player features. The player's obvious 
navigation features-for example, the longer you hold the fast-forward 
button the further you move ahead in the book-added to ease-of-use, as 
did the tactile buttons and color-coding design features. 
	As patrons usually read on their own, NLS was interested in how 
easy the players were to operate without outside assistance. For that 
reason, participants received only braille and large-print instruction 
cards. If they encountered challenges, users could access audible help 
through the player's key identifier function, which narrates the 
actions of each button as it is pressed. Overall patrons encountered no 
major problems operating the machine on their own. 
	According to Jeff Witt, the National Federation of the Blind's 
program manager for accessibility issues, who directed this round of 
tests, patrons were ultimately pleased with the functional prototype's 
performance and were confident that the machine met their needs.

Moving ahead
Armed with important patron feedback, NLS will make any necessary 
refinements to the functional prototype before conducting a second 
round of usability tests in February 2007. Once NLS is satisfied with 
the prototype, it will develop a preproduction prototype that will 
resemble the final digital talking-book machine. Following further 
tests and refinement to the preproduction prototype, the digital 
talking-book player and cartridge will head to the final stage of the 
process-production.  

Praise profile 
NLS continues to receive positive, unsolicited feedback on the digital 
talking-book player and cartridge from both patrons and regional 
libraries. Here is the latest noteworthy comment NLS would like to 
share: "The high contrast of the machine and the cartridge and the 
bright colors of the buttons will be an instant hit with our seniors. 
We finally have a design that appears to be simple, practical, and easy 
to use, with all the necessary options but without the confusing 
complexity created by the options and layout of the C-1." John D. Hall, 
Director, Arkansas Regional Library for the Blind.
