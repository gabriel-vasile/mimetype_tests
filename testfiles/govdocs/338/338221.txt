Securities Trades By Company Pei sonnel

No director, officer. or employee of Enron Corp. or its subsidiaries or its
affiliated companies (collectively referred to herein as "Company") shall,
directly or indirectly, trade in the securities or Enron Corp., Enron Oil &
Gas Company, Northern Border Partners, LE, EOTT Ener;y Partners,
L.P., or any ether Enron Corp. .,ubsidiary or affiliated company with pub-
lidy-traded securities, of any other publicly-held company -while in the
possession of material non-public information relating to or affecting any
such companies, disclose such information to others who may trade, or
recommend the purchase or sale of securities of a company to which such
information relates. Advice should be sought in respect of equivalent
requirements under other applicable jurisdictions.

The Need For A Policy Statement

I9

The Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and the Justice
Department actively pursue violations of insider trading laws.
Historically; their efforts were concentrated on individuals directly
involved in trading abuses. In 1988, to further deter insider trading
violations, Congress several years ago expanded the authority of the SEC
and the Justice Department, adopting the Insider Trading and Securities
Fraud Enforcement Act (the "Act"). In addition to increasing the penalties
for insider trading, the Act puts the onus on companies and possibly
other "controlling persons" for violations by company personnel.

Although the Act is aimed primarily at the securities industry, application
of the laws may be made to companies in other industries. Many experts
have concluded that if companies like Enron Corp. do not take active
steps to adopt preventive policies and procedures covering securities
trades by company personnel, the consequences could be severe.

In addition to responding to the Act, we are adopting this Policy
Statement to avoid even the appearance of improper conduct on the
part of anyone employed by or associated with the Company (not just
so-called insiders). We have all worked hard over the years to establish
our reputation for integrity and ethical conduct We cannot afford to have
it damaged.

I The Consequences

This policy applies to all employees of the Company. It is intended to
provide guidance to employees with respect to existing legal restrictions.
It is not intended to result in the imposition of liability on employees that
would not exist in the absence of such policy. Any breach of this policy,
however, may subject employees to criminal pcmalties.

The consequences of insider trading violations can be staggering:
For individuals who trade on inside information (or tip information to
others):

  A civil penalty of up to three times the profit gained or loss
avoided;

• A criminal fine (no matter how small the profit) of up to $1 mil

  lion; and
1
  • A jail term of up to ten years.

For a company (as well as possibly any supervisot.y person) that tails to
take appropriate steps to prevent illegal trading:
  • A civil penalty of the greater of $1 million or three times the prof-
it gained or loss avoided as a result of the employee's violation;
and

• A criminal penalty of up to $2.5 million.

Moreover, if an employee violates the Company insider trading policy,
the Company unposed sanctions, including dismissal for cause, could
result.

Our Policy

If a director, officer, or any employee of the Company (as defined herein)
has material non-public information relating to Enron Corp., Enron Oil &
Gas Company, Northern Border Partners, L.P., EOTT Energy Partners,
L.P., or any other Enron Corp. subsidiary or affiliated company with
publicly-traded securities, it is the Company's policy that neither that
person nor any related Ferson may buy or sell securities of Enron Corp.,
Enron Oil & Gas Company, Northern Border Partners, L.P., EOTT Energy
Partners, L.P., or other Enron Corp. subsidiary or affiliated company with
publicly traded securities, or engage in any other action to take advantage
of, or pass on to others, that information. This policy also applies to
material non-public information relating to any other company, including
our customers or suppliers, obtained in the course of employment.
Transactions that may be necessary or justifiable for independent reasons
(such as the need to raise money for an emergency expenditure) are no
exception. Even the appearance of an improper transaction must be
avoided to preserve the Company's reputation for adhering to the high-
est standards of conduct
Material Information. Material information is any information that a rea-
sonable investor would consider important in a decision to buy, hold, or
sell stock: in short, arty information which could reasonably beer
to affect the price of the stock. If you are considering buying or selling a
security because of information you possess, you should assume such
information is material.
Examples.. Common examples of information that will frequently be
regarded as material are: projections of future earnings or losses; news of
a pending or proposed merger, acquisition, or tender offer; news of a signif-
icant sale of assets or the disposition of a subsidiary; changes in dividend
policies or the declaration of a stock split or the offering of additional
securities; changes in management, significant new products or discoveries;
impending bankruptcy or financial liquidity problems; and the gain or loss
of a substantial customer or supplier. Either positive or negative informa-
tion may be material. The foregoing list is by no means exclusive.

Twenty-Twenty Hindsight If your securities transactions becor.in the
subject of scrutiny, they will be viewed after-the-fact with the benefit of
hindsight. As a result, before engaging in any transaction you should
carefully consider how regulators and others might view your transaction
in hindsight.
  Transactions By family Members. The very same restrictions apply to
your family members and others living in your household. Employees
are expected to be responsible for the compliance of their rranediate
family and personal household.
  M Wing formation To Others. Whether the information is proprietary
information about the Company or information that could have an
impact on our stock prices, employees must not pass material non-public
information on to others; this is called tipping. The above penalties may
apply, whether or not you derive any direct benefit from anther's
actions.

When Information Is Public. Information is "non-public" until it has
been disseminated in a manner making it available to investors generally.
This is typically satisfied by distribution cf such information b-. mre'ne
of a press release. However, even after such information is released to
the press, you should wait a period of time (at least one business day
and often two or three business days) before trading or disclosing such
information to others. Again, it is a good idea to exercise caution and
wait a longer period of time following the release of material information
than you might first consider warranted.

additioial guidance from wine Overturf, Deputy Corporate Secretary
and Director of Stockr older Relations, at (713) 853-6062. who will consult

responsib iity for adhering to the Polity Statement and avoiding improper
transactions rests with you. In this regard. it is imperative that you act in
good faith and use your best judgment.

Information Security Policy

Trade Secrets and Confidential Information

You may have access to or become aware of confidential and/or propri-
etary Information of the Company - that is, information relating to the
Company's business which is not generally pr publicly known. This
information includes but is not limited to:

  Internal telephone lists and directories; bid, trading, and financial
data; planned new projects and ventures; advertising and marketing
programs; lists of potential or actual customers and suppliers; wage
and salary or other personnel data; capital investment plans; changes
in management or policies of the company; suppliers' prices; and
other trade secrets.
The term "trade secret" means any type of information that has indepen-
dent economic value because it is not generally known or publicly ascer-
tainable by proper means and the owner has taken reasonable measures
to keep it confidentiaL

The Company's confidential or proprietary information could be very
helpful to suppliers and the Company's competitors, to the detriment'
of the Company. To help protect the Company's interests, business units
have established and implemented computer and electronic security
measures to ensure that employees have the means to communicate
domestically and internationally in a secure fashion. Employees should
follow these guidelines:

No employee may use, either for his/her own personal benefit or
for the benefit of others, Company information that is not publicly
known;

EXH012-03050


  • No employee should disclose trade secrets or proprietary or confiden-
tial information to other employees or outsiders, except as required
in the rnndlurt of tha Cmmnanv'c hncinncw


=============
Page 12 of 58
=============

• Dispose of documents containing the Company's confidential
or proprietary information with care so as to avoid inadvertent
disclosure; and

• Guard against inadvertently disclosing such information in public
discussions where you may be overheard and in discussions with
family members o; friends.

Information about Others

Our employees have a duty and legal obligation to respect the
confidentiality rights of others. In the normal course of doing business,
it is common to acquire information about other companies and current
or potential customers, suppliers, or competitors. You should respect
the proprietary nature of this information and not use it or reveal
it to others.

e

In 1996, the U.S. Congress passed the Economic Espionage Act which
provides significant criminal penalties for persons who engage in the
theft of trade secrets.

In addition, the Economic Espionage Act prohibits you from acquiring
confidential or proprietary information (including technology) about
other companies through improper means, such as deceit, misrepresenta-
tion, or receipt of information illegally acquired by a third party, or from
present or former employees who are not authorized to disclose it.

Employees of the Company have a responsibility to comply with all
applicable laws and regulations regarding the safe design, construction, 1
maintenance, and operation of Company facilities. It is the responsibility
of every employee to perform his or her work and conduct the
Company's operations in a safe manner. Employees should be awarc
that health and safety laws may provide for significant civil and criminal
penalties against individuals and/or the Company for failure to comply
with applicable requirements. Accordingly, each employee must comply

by an employee which violates the federal Economic Espionage Act, the
federal Copyright Act, the federal Trademark Counterfeiting Act, or any
other applicable domestic or foreign laws.

More specifically, all employees must recognize that the term "trade
secret" means any type of information that has independent economic
value because it is not generally known or publicly ascertainable by
proper means and which the third party owns and has takerr reasonable
measures to keep confidential.

An employee will not knowingly:
(1) take, carry away, or obtain a third party secret without authoriza-
tion or obtain a third party trade secret by fraud or deception;
  (2) copy, download, mail, deliver, send, transmit, or communicate
a third party trade secret without authorization; or
  (3) receive, buy, or possess a third party trade secret knowing it has
been stolen or obtained without authorization.

Further, if an employee uses trade secrets of a :comer emp:oyer without
the former employer's permission, this conduct violates the federal
Economic Espionage Act. An employee will not willfully infringe for
purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain a third
party's copyright in a work by copying the work, distributing copies
of the work, using the work to prepare derivative works, or in the case
of some works, to publicly display or perform the work.

An employee will not intentionally traffic in goods or services using
a counterfeit or spurious trademark. All employees should be aware
that a violation of applicable domestic or foreign laws, particularly the
federal Economic Espionage Act, the federal Copyright Act, or the federal
Trademark Counterfeiting Act, may result in the imposition of significant
civil and criminal penalties for the Company as well as for the individual
employees.

benefits any foreign government, foreign instrumentality, or foreign

governments, may monitor contemporaneous communications
of all types (including communication by telephone, facsimile
machine, computer modems, special long-distance services, cellular
phones, voice mail, pagers, electronic mail, mail, and other
delivery services) or access stored communications, data, or
information of all types, subject to the protections of the Fourth
Amendment of the United States Constitution, which generally

governments, may monitor contemporaneous oral, wire, or
electronic communications of all types subject to federal statutes
such as First Amendment Privacy Protection Act and the
Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act as amended
by the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986.

2. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the rules of civil procedure
for almost all States permit requests for production of documents
that are likely to lead to the discovery of relevant evidence. Both
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Texas Rules of Civil
Procedure specifically allow the discovery of electronically main-
tained data. For example, Rule 34 of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure and Rule 166b(2)(b) of the Texas Rules of Civil

nerships, joint ventures and associations, or an individual, such
as an official, employee, contractor, client, agent, etc, by name or
title at the address of the organization, shall be delivered to the
organization. This is also true with respect to mail addressed in
this manner to former officials, employees, contractors, agents,
clients, etc. Moreover, mail addressed in this manner but bearing
the term "personal" is no different from :)the-- mail and shat' be
delivered by the United States Postal 3 mice to the Company. For
example, the United States Postal Service will deliver each of the
following to the offices of the Company:

does not pertain to the business of the Company. The Company
shall have the right to open the mail if there is some question
as to its deliverability and/or forward the mail to a superior
or Company designated recipient if the person to whom the

INTERNET SECURITY POLICY: SCOPE OF
USE OF ELECTRONIC MEDIA AND SERVICES

Introduction - General Application of This Policy

This Internet Security Policy d afines roles, responsibilities, and policies for
tha Compan 's employees, agents, and contractors using the Company's
communications facilities to access third party electronic media and ser-
vices such as the Internet.
As an advanced technology company, we increasingly use and exploit
electronic forms of communication and information exchange. Company
employees, agents, and contractors may have access to one or more
forms of electronic media and services, computers, a-mail, telephones,
voicemail, fax machines, external electronic bulletin boards, wire services,
on-line services, and the Internet.
The Company encourages the use of these media and associated services
because information technology is part of our business, because they
make communication more efficient and effective, and because they are
valuable sources of information about vendors, customers, new products,
and services. However, Company-provided access to electronic media
and services (e. g. an Internet account) are the Company's property, and
their purpose is to facilitate Company business.
With the rapidly changing nature of electronic media, and the
"netiquette" which is developing among users of external on-line
services and the Internet, this Internet Policy cannot lay down rules
to cover every possible situation. Instead, this Internet Policy expresses
the Company's philosophy and sets forth general principles to be applied
to use of electronic media and services. This Internet Policy applies to all
Company employees, agents, and contractors using electronic media
and services which are: accessed on or from Company premises; accessed
using Company computer equipment, or via Company-paid access
methods,, and/or used in a manner which identifies the individual with
the Company collectively, and individually, such individuals will be
referred to as "Internet Users".

EC 38015907 29

=XH012-03069

Use of Company-provided access to the Internet is intended to be primar-
ily for the Company's business-related purposes. Internet access is moni-
tored, and actual web-site connections are recorded. Excessive use of
Company-provided access to the Internet for non-business-related pur-
poses will result in loss of access privileges.
  Procedures. Guidelines, And Restrictions

Accounts and Account Passwords

  (a) You are responsible for the security of your account password(s)
and will be held responsible for all use or misuse of your account.
You must maintain secure passwords to your account. Internet
Users accessing the Internet over a Company network may be
required to use an ID and password at the firewall (in addition to
their usual LAN sign on). Passwords are machine generated and
will be changed every thirty days. You must follow all directions
of the Company's system administrators with respect to security of
passwords and take reasonable precautions against unauthorized
access.

  (b) Remote login to the Company network is prohibited unless permis-
sion to do so is granted. Do not remotely log into (or otherwise
use) any workstation or computer not designated explicitly for
public logins over the Company network- even if the configura-
tion of the computer permits remote access - unless you have
explicit permission from the owner and the current user of that
computer to log into that machine.

  (c) Access to selected Internet hosts or networks which the Company
designates as inappropriate may be denied. You may not use any
account set up for another user and you may not attempt to find out
the password of a service for which you have not been authorized,
including accounts set up for other users.

  (i) File Transfer Protocol "FM" may be used to initiate
transfer of data from/to specified Company hosts and
from/to selected Internet hosts. Initiation of F P sessions
to Company hosts from the Internet is prohibited.

EXH012-03070


=============
Page 32 of 58
=============

(ii) Access to `network news" is allowed with restrictions.
The Company will apply filters as appropriate to block
certain news groups.

(iii) Access to the "World Wide Web" is permitted.
Inappropriate sites may be blocked from the Company
network.

(iv) All services not explicitly allowed are prohibited. Use of
games or other non-work related objects over the
Internet is prohibited.

(d) Network services and World Wide Web sites can and do monitor
access and usage and can identify at least which company - and
often which specific individual - is accessing their services. Thus,
accessing a particular bulletin board or Website leaves Company-
identifiable electronic "tracks" even if the Internet User merely
reviews or downloads the material and does not post any message.
As a general rule, all Internet use should be conducted with this in
mind so as to always portray the Company as a reputable compa-
ny and to maintain its reputation and goodwill.

Intended Uses

Electronic media and services are primarily for Company business use.
All Company systems and related equipment are intended for the commu-
nication, transmission, processing, and storage of Company-authorized
information. Limited, occasional, or incidental use of electronic media
(sending or receiving) for personal, non-business purposes is under-
standable and acceptable -- as is the case with personal phone calls.
However, Internet Users need to demonstrate a sense of responsibility
and may not abuse the privilege.

ed in each e-mail message. Internet Users are solely responsible
for all electronic mail originating from their user id. When using

employee upon signing the Certificate of Compliance consents
to such action from the Company to review and disclose any
electronic files and messages (including e-mail) and usage to

Assuring Proper Use of The Company's System Resources

Electronic media and services should be used in an efficient and economical
manner and not in a way that is likely to cause network congestion or
significantly hamper the ability of other people to access and use the
Company's computer systems. Any software that is designed to destroy
data, provide unauthorized access to the Company's computer systems, or
disrupt computing processes is prohibited.

Confidentiality and Encryption

In accordance with the Policy on Use of Communication Services and
Equipment, Internet Users will maintain the confidentiality of the
Company's confidential and/or proprietary information and will not use
such information for their personal benefit. Any messages or information
sent by an Internet User to one or more individuals via an electronic
network (e.g., bulletin board, on-line service, or Internet) are statements

Compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act

The United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the "Act") applies
to the Company in its worldwide operations as well as individually to
all Company employees who are United States citizens, nationals, or
residents with respect to their worldwide activities. The Act prohibits
the corrupt offer, payment or gift of money or anything of value to a
foreign governmental official or employee or to any foreign political
candidate or party for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of
a governmental body in order to obtain or retain business or to direct
business to any person. The Act also prohibits the offer, payment or gift
of money or anything of value to any third party with knowledge that
all or a portion of such money or thing of value will be transferred to a
governmental official or employee or political candidate for the prohibited
purposes. The Act contains certain narrow affirmative defenses to its
prohibitions.
The Act provides for criminal and civil penalties. Criminal sanctions of
up to $2,000,000 per offense can be imposed on the Company and fines
of up to $100,000 per offense and imprisonment for up to 5 years can be
imposed on individuals convicted of violating the Act. Company policy
requires strict compliance with the Act.
Due to the broad nature of the Act's prohibitions, it may be implicated by
a wide range of activities in addition to direct bribery of a foreign official.
For instance, arrangements with foreign joint venture partners, foreign
agency or sponsorship arrangements, and any direct dealings with,
including lavish entertainment of, foreign governmental officials or
employees may raise issues under the Act.
Any questions with respect to the application of the Act to any proposed
activity by the Company should be referred immediately to Company
legal counsel.

Compliance with Antitrust Laws

All employees of the Company are expected to comply fully with all
applicable federal, state, and foreign antitrust laws. Whenever any doubt
exists as to the legality of any action or arrangement, such transa thon
must be submitted to Company legal counsel for prior approval and
continuing review. Both the spirit and the letter of antitrust laws are to be
followed, so as to avoid creating any unlawful restraints on competition
or the appearance of any unlawful restraints.

In the United States, certain types of agreements with third party
persons, including competitors, suppliers, or customers, are unlawful
per se under federal antitrust law. That is to say, such agreements are
automatically in violation of such laws, regardless of the agreement's
commercial reasonableness, its purpose, or actual effect on competition.
Other agreements with competitors or customers, although not unlawful
per se, may be unlawful under the antitrust "rule of reason."

Formal or informal arrangements with actual or potential competitcrs
(a broadly defined group) which limit or restrict cnmpetiticr may
constitute per se violations. Such unlawful agreements include those
which: fix, stabilize, or control prices (also a broadly defined term which
includes not only price but any element of price such as credit terms,
discounts, freight rates etc.) or terms or conditions of sale; allocate
products, markets, customers, or territories; boycott customers or
suppliers; or limit or prohibit a party form carrying on a particular
commercial enterprise. To assure compliance with antitrust laws,
Company employees are not to enter into any discussion or arrangement
with an actual or potential competitor which could result in any such
per se violation. Further, since the existence of an unlawful agreement
may be inferred from the mere exchange of competitively sensitive
information between competitors, absent prior review and approvalby
Company counsel that such actions are lawful no employee shall give to
or accept from a competitor any information concerning prices, terms,
and conditions of sale, or any other competitive information.

EXH012-03082

Page 44 of 58

Certain types of restrictive understandirge between a customer and sup-
plier are also deemed to be anticompetitive and may be per se antitrust
+ violations. Some such agreements are dearly per se illegal, such as an
agreement between a supplier and a distributor setting the distributor's
minimum resale prices. Others may be per se illegal if the party imposing
the agreement has market power, such as an agreement imposing a
requirement of reciprocal dealing, (for example, an agreement that one
party bLys goods trori another only u- tie understanding that the second
party will buy goods from the first), or tying a customer's right to buy
one product or service to the obligation to buy another. These possible per
se illegal arrangements muse not be agreed to or discussed with a cus-
tomer, absent prior review and approval by Company counsel that the
arrangement is lawful.
  Agreements that do not unambiguously injure competition (i.e., that are
not per se illegal) are analyzed under the antitrust rule of reason. Under
the antitrust "rule of reason" test, a court determines whether a particular
agreement acts as an "unreasonable" restraint on trade and thus is anti-
competihve and unlawful. Such a determination is bared on a particular
set of facts and circumstances, including the terms of die agreement, the
purposes, the relationship of the parties, and the probable effects on com-
petition. Since the circumstances surrounding any arrangement change
from time to time, it is essential that agreements which could potentially
cause an unreasonable restraint on trade be subject to continuing review by
Company legal counsel.

Unilateral action by the Company (in other words, conduct not involving
an agreement) may also violate the antitrust laws. Any transaction or
practice that would appear to result in the Company gaining a monopoly
in a particular line of business in a particular market or geographic area,
or which indicates an intent to drive a competitor out of business or to
prevent a competitor from entering a market, should therefore be avoided
and discussed with Company legal counsel.

Also, discriminating pricing can violate a complicated antitrust statute
known as the Robinson-Patman Act.

The sznctions resulting from violations of the antitrust laws can be
severe, both as to corporations and as to individuals; they include both
criminal penalties and civil treble damages. Whenever arty question
arises as to the significance or application of antitrust laws, Company
legal cowt•el moist be consulted, and any agreements with possible
antitrust implications shall be made only with prior approval of
Company legal counsel.

International operations may be subject to antitrust laws of either the
United States or foreign countries, so employees should be aware of
the implication of any such laws to Company transactions.

Advice should be sought in respect of equivalent requirements under
other applicable jurisdictions, including the European Commission.

Compliance with Environmental Laws

Employees of Enron Corp., its subsidiaries, and its affiliated companies
(collectively the "Company") must conduct Company operations in
compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulaticas
including those of other countries which have jurisdiction over Company
activities. These laws are designed to protect the environment in which
we live and work, human health, wildlife, and natural resources.
Environmental laws either prohibit or severely restrict the release of
pollutants to the air, land, surface water, and groundwater. They contain
numerous waste management requirements. They impose on owners
and operators of most types of facilities the duty to protect the envf:on-
ment by requiring them to obtain permits for certain emissions, to repcr'
releases and spills of materials which may cause pollution, and to create
and maintain certain records. The Company is committed to environmental
protection, and it expects employees to abide by the letter and the spirit
of these laws. Employees who do not follow environmental rules and
regulations shall oe subject to appropriate disciplinary action.

Those 'e p,es.ble for the conctructici and the operation of Company
facilities must ensure that the Company has the necessary environmental
permits i nd clearances for these activities and that the Company complies
with the terms and conditions of its permits. These individuals are charged
with the responsibility of ensuring that the Company makes all required
environmental reports and maintains, at the appropriate location, all
required environmental records. Employees must consider the environmental
consequences of all aspects of Company operations and proposed
changes .o our operations.

  One of the major environmental laws of the United States may have
significant legal and economic consequences for companies which fail
to consider the environmental aspects of proposed transactions. The
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability
Act (CERCLA, commonly known as "Superfund") was passed to
provide a means for cleaning up abandoned waste disposal sites and for

  EC 38015915 -
45

EXH012-03085


=============
Page 47 of 58
=============

responding to environmental emergencies. CERCLAimposes sweeping
liability (i) on those who sent hazardous substances to sites that may be
cleaned up under CERCLA, (ii) on those who owned or operated these
sites when hazardous substances were sent there, (iii) on those who
transported hazardous substances to these sites, and (iv) on those who
now own or operate these sites. These four classes of persons are potentially
responsible for the entire cost of cleaning up the site. Employees must
attempt to avoid actions which would increase the Company's Superfund
liability Those who are responsible for disposing waste offsite should
ensure that the disposal facility is well managed by a reputable firm.
Those who engage in real estate transactions of any nature, particularly
acquiring property rights, should make all appropriate inquiry about
environmental conditions at the property before completing the real
estate transaction.
Environmental regulations change constantly both in the United States
and abroad. Those who are responsible for environmental compliance
should make every effort to stay abreast of changes to regulations which
affect the Company and to plan accordingly for the implementation of
regulations which have been proposed.
Environmental audits may be used to verify compliance with environmental
regulations. The US. Environmental Protection Agency and the Department
of Justice encourage the performance of periodic, internal environmental
audits to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. The Company
likewise encourages those in charge of operations to conduct periodic
environmental audits of Company facilities.
The Company encourages the efforts of employees to minimize the
quantity of waste generated by Company operations and to recycle
waste which is produced. Innovative waste minimization not only
protects the environment by reducing the volume of waste generated,
it may also result in reduced operating costs for the Company.
All employees should be aware that the violation of environmental laws
may result in the imposition of significant civil and criminal penalties for
the Company as well as for individual employees. Many of the laws that
apply to the Company's operations in the US. provide for civil penalties

' in the amount of $25,000 per violation, and they make each day of violation
a separate offense. Criminal penalties for environmental violations may
be as much as fifteen (15) years imprisonment per violation. Severe criminal
and civil penalties for environmental violations may also be imposed in
other countries in which the Company conducts its business.

Advice should be sought with respect to requirements and powers of
enforcement agencies in jurisdictions outside of the United State;.

Investments and Outside Businoss Interests
of Officers and Employees



Employees of the Company have injuired from time to time as to the
propriety of their association with, or the investment of their personal
funds in, business enteaprses similar in character to certain activities of
the Company. In response, the Company has established certain princi-
ples for the guidance of officers and emp~oyees with respect to personal
business and investment interests.

The primary consideration of the employment of every full-time (regular
as well as temporary) officer and employee should be the fact that the
employer is entitled to expect of every such person complete loyalty to
the best interests of the Company and the maximum application of skill,
talent, education, etc., to the discharge of job responsibilities, without any
reservations whatever. Therefore, it follows that no full-time officer or
employee should:

(a) Engage in any outside activity or enterprise which could interfere
in -n-, ;,-»y with rvb psrformance,
(b) Make investments or perform services for his or her own or
related interest in any enterprise under any circumstances where,
by reason of the nature of the business conducted by such
enterprise, there is, or could be, a disparity or conflict of interest
between the officer or emplo; ee and the Company; or
(c) Own an interest in or participate, directly or indirectly, in the
profits of any other entity which does business with or is a
competitor of the Company, unless such ownership or participation
has been previously disclosed in writing to the Chairman of the
Board and Chief Executive Officer of Enron Corp. and such officer
has determined that such interest or participation does not
adversely affect the best interests of the Company.

  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Policy on
Investments, securities of publicly owned corporations which are
regularly traded on the open market may be owned without disclosure
  if they are not purchased as a result of confidential knowledge about

the Company's operations, relations, business, or negotiations with such
corporations.
if an im'estment of personal funds by an officer or employee in a venture
cr enterprise will riot entail personal services or managerizz1 attention,
and if there appear' to be no conflict or disparity of interest involved,
the following procedure nevertheless shall be follower if all or any part
of the busin'ss of me venture or enterprise is identical with, or similar
or directly related to, that conducted by the Company, or if such business
consists of the furnishing of goods or services of a type utilized to a
material ertent by the Company:
  (a) The officer or employee desiring to make such investment st.al.'
submit in writing to the Chairman of the Board and Chief
Executive Officer of Enron Corp. a brief sumwaryy of relevant
facts; and
(b) The Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Enron
Coi p. shall consider carefully the summary of relevant facts,
  and if he concludes that there appears to he no probability of
.imp conflict of inter,st aris:no out of the proposed investment, .
the officer or employee shall be so notified and may then make
the proposed investment in full reliance upon the findings of
the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of
  Etiron Corp.
In the event the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
of Enron Corp. should desire to make such an investment, he may
do so only upon approval of the majority of a quorum of the Executive
Committee of the Board of Directors of Enron Corp., other than himself,
at any regular or special meeting of such Committee.
Every officer and employee shall be under a continuing duty to report,
in the manner set forth above, any situation where by reason of economic
or other interest in an enterprise there is then present the possibility of a
conflict or disparity of interest between the officer or employee and the
Company. This obligation includes but is not limited to (1) any existing

personal investment at the date of promulgation of this policy, (2) any
existing personal investment at the time of employment of any officer
or employee by the Company, and (3) any existing personal investment,
whether or not previously approved, which may become in conflict with
the provisions of this policy because of changes in the business of the
Company or changes in the business of the outside enterprise in which
investment has been made.

In the event of a finding by the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive
Officer of Enron Corp. (or by the Executive Committee of the Board of
Directors of Enron Corp., if applicable) that a material conflict or disparity
of interest does exist with respect to any existing personal investment of
an officer or employee, then, upon being so notified, the officer or
employee involved shall immediately divest himself or herself of such
interest and shall notify the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of
Enron Corp. (or the Executive Committee, if applicable) in writing that
he or she has done so.

Responsibility for Reporting

The Company has established a reporting system that allows officers,
employees, and other agents of the Company to report violations of any
of the Policies set forth in this booklet, or other Company policies, as well
as any suspected criminal conduct by any officer, employee, or agent of
the Company relating to the performance of his or her duties.
Upon observing or learning of any such violation or criminal conduct,
employees should report the same by writing a letter describing the
suspected violation or criminal conduct with as much detail as possible
and sending the letter to:
  Enron Compliance Officer

Employees may also report the same by telephoning the Office of the
Chairman of the Company at (713) 853-7294 or sending ccmail addressed
to the Office of the Chairman. If an employee places the call from his or
her extension, or an outside line, the message will be completely anony-
mous. Similarly, ccMail addressed to the Office of the Chairman will
also be completely anonymous.
The employee may (but is not required to) sign the letter or ccMail.
Anonymous letters and anonymous ccMail will be investigated and
acted upon in the same manner as letters and ccMail which contain a
signature. All letters and ccMail should contain as much specific detail
as possible to allow the Company to conduct an investigation of the
reported matter.
All letters, ccMail, and telephone calls submitted shall be kept in
confidence and acted upon only by designated objective Company
personnel unless disclosure is required or deemed advisable in
connection with any governmental investigation or report, in the
interest of the Company, or in the Company's legal handling of the
matter. The Company will not condone any form of retribution upon
