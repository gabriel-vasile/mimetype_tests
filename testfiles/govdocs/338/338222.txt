 I.  INTRODUCTION 
 1.  In  recent  years  there  has  been  an  explosion  in  competition  and  innovation  in  the  telecommunications  industry.  Long-  distance  customers  have  reaped  substantial  benefits  in  the  form 
 of  greater  choice  in  deciding  which  carrier  to  use  and  a  greater  diversity  in  the  prices  charged  for  those  calls.  For  example,  dial-  around  (or  “10-  10”)  numbers  allow  consumers  to  bypass  or  “dial-around” 
 their  chosen  long-  distance  carrier  to  get  a  better  rate  in  certain  circumstances.  Consumers  also  can  opt  for  calling  plans  that  offer  a  fixed  per-  minute  rate  during  certain  hours  or  on  particular 
 days. 
 2.  Numerous  carriers,  both  large  and  small,  promote  their  services  through  national  television,  print,  and  direct  mail  advertising  campaigns.  Because  no  one  plan  is  right  for  everyone, 
 advertising  plays  a  critical  role  in  informing  consumers  about  the  myriad  choices  in  long-  distance  calling  and,  in  the  case  of  dial-  around  services,  advertising  is  generally  the  only  source  of 
 information  consumers  typically  have  before  incurring  charges.  With  accurate  information,  consumers  benefit  from  being  able  to  choose  the  particular  carrier  that  meets  their  long-  distance 
 calling  needs  at  the  most  economical  price.  However,  if  consumers  are  deceived  by  the  advertising  claims,  they  cannot  make  informed  purchasing  decisions  and  ultimately  the  growth  of  competition 
 in  the  long-  distance  market  will  be  stifled.

 3.  The  proliferation  of  advertisements  for  dial-  around  numbers,  long-  distance  calling  plans,  and  other  new  telecommunications  services,  as  well  as  an  increase  in  the  number  of 
 complaints  regarding  how  these  services  are  promoted,  have  raised  questions  about  how  the  principles  of  truthful  advertising  apply  in  this  dynamic  marketplace.  To  address  these  questions  the 
 Federal  Trade  Commission  and  the  Federal  Communications  Commission  issue  this  Joint  Policy  Statement. 


 4.  Section  201(  b)  of  the  Communications  Act  of  1934,  as  amended,  requires  that  common  carriers’  “practices  .  .  .  for  and  in  connection  with  .  .  .  communications  service,  shall  be 
 just  and  reasonable,  and  any  such  .  .  .  practice  .  .  .  that  is  unjust  or  unreasonable  is  hereby  declared  to  be  unlawful  .  .  .”.  1  The  FCC  has  found  that  unfair  and  deceptive  marketing  practices  by  common 
 carriers  constitute  unjust  and  unreasonable  practices  under  section  201(  b).  2  Principles  of  truth-  in-advertising  law  developed  by  the  FTC  under  Section  5  of  the  FTC  Act  3  provide  helpful  guidance  to 
 carriers  regarding  how  to  comply  with  section  201(  b)  of  the  Communications  Act  in  this  context. 
 5.  The  FTC’s  truth-  in-  advertising  law  can  be  boiled  down  to  two  common-  sense  propositions:  1)  advertising  must  be  truthful  and  not  misleading;  and  2)  before  disseminating  an  ad, 
 advertisers  must  have  adequate  substantiation  for  all  objective  product  claims.  4  A  deceptive  ad  is  one  that  contains  a  misrepresentation  or  omission  that  is  likely  to  mislead  consumers  acting 
 reasonably  under  the  circumstances  about  a  material  fact.  5  Material  facts  are  those  that  are  important  to  a  consumer’s  decision  to  buy  or  use  a  product.  Information  pertaining  to  the  central 
 characteristics  of  the  product  or  service  is  presumed  material.  The  cost  of  a  product  or  service  is  an  example  of  an  attribute  presumed  material.  6 


 6.  Advertisers  are  responsible  for  substantiating  all  objective  express  and  implied  claims  that  an  ad  conveys  to  reasonable  consumers,  regardless  of  whether  the  advertiser  intended  to

 3  15  U.  S.  C.  §  45.  Section  5  declares  unlawful  “unfair  or  deceptive  acts  or  practices  in  or  affecting  commerce.” 
 4  These  principles  are  articulated  in  the  FTC’s  Deception  Policy  Statement  and  Advertising  Substantiation  Policy 


 Statement.  See  generally  Federal  Trade  Commission  Policy  Statement  on  Deception,  appended  to  Cliffdale  Associates,  Inc.,  103  F.  T.  C.  110,  174  et  seq.  (1984)  (“  Deception  Statement”);  Advertising  Substantiation  Policy  Statement, 


 appended  to  Thompson  Medical  Co.,  104  F.  T.  C.  648,  839  (1984),  aff'd,  791  F.  2d  189  (D.  C.  Cir.  1986),  cert.  denied,  479  U.  S.  1086  (1987).  The  FTC  also  has  authority  to  challenge  unfair  trade  practices.  An  unfair  practice  is  one  that  causes 
 or  is  likely  to  cause  substantial  injury  to  consumers  which  is  not  reasonably  avoidable  by  consumers  themselves  and  not  outweighed  by  countervailing  benefits  to  consumers  or  competition.  15  U.  S.  C.  §  45(  n).  The  majority  of  FTC 
 advertising  cases  are  brought  pursuant  to  the  FTC’s  deception  authority. 
 5  The  FCC  has  taken  a  similar  approach  under  section  201(  b)  of  the  Communications  Act:  “BDP  knew,  or  should  have 


 known,  that  customers  acting  reasonably  under  the  circumstances  would  be  misled  and  confused  by  misrepresentations  regarding  the  material  issue  of  BDP’s  identity,  and  that  customers  would  rely  on  such  misrepresentations  to  their 


 detriment.”  Business  Discount  Plan,  14  FCC  Rcd  at  356.

 convey  those  claims.  In  determining  the  claims  that  an  ad  conveys,  the  FTC  looks  to  the  “net  impression”  conveyed  to  consumers—  often  described  as  “the  entire  mosaic,  rather  than  each  tile 
 separately.”  7  Even  if  the  wording  of  an  ad  may  be  literally  truthful,  the  net  impression  conveyed  to  consumers  may  still  be  misleading.  The  entire  advertisement,  transaction  or  course  of  dealing  will 
 be  considered.  The  issue  is  whether  the  act  or  practice  is  likely  to  mislead,  rather  than  whether  it  causes  actual  deception. 


 7.  An  ad  may  be  deceptive  by  omission.  For  example,  an  ad  may  be  deceptive  if  it  fails  to  disclose  qualifying  information  that,  in  light  of  the  representations  made,  would  be  necessary  to 
 prevent  consumers  from  being  misled.  The  failure  to  disclose  is  examined  in  light  of  expectations  and  understandings  of  the  typical  buyer  regarding  the  claims  made.  8 


 8.  In  many  circumstances,  reasonable  consumers  do  not  read  the  entirety  of  an  ad  or  are  directed  away  from  the  importance  of  the  qualifying  phrase  by  the  acts  or  statements  of  the  seller. 
 Depending  on  the  circumstances,  accurate  information  in  the  text  may  not  remedy  a  misleading  impression  created  by  a  headline  because  reasonable  consumers  may  glance  only  at  the  headline. 
 Written  disclosures  in  fine  print  may  be  insufficient  to  correct  a  misleading  impression.  Legalistic  disclaimers  too  complex  for  consumers  to  understand  may  not  cure  otherwise  deceptive  messages 
 or  practices.  Qualifying  disclosures  must  be  legible  and  understandable.  The  totality  of  the  ad  or  the  practice  must  be  evaluated  with  questions  such  as:  How  clear  is  the  representation?  How 
 conspicuous  is  any  qualifying  information?  How  important  is  the  omitted  information?  Do  other  sources  for  the  omitted  information  exist?  How  familiar  is  the  public  with  the  product  or  service? 


 9.  At  the  outset,  it  is  important  to  note  that  these  fundamental  principles  apply  across  the  board.  For  example,  a  misrepresentation  or  omission  of  material  information  in  an 
 advertisement  for  a  dial-  around  service  would  likely  be  deceptive  if  the  same  misrepresentation  or  omission  occurred  in  an  ad  for  a  long-  distance  calling  plan.  Furthermore,  the  same  standards  of 
 truthfulness  apply  regardless  of  the  medium  advertisers  choose  to  communicate  their  message  to  consumers.  Although  the  most  effective  method  for  disclosing  information  to  consumers  may  vary 
 depending  on  the  medium,  the  principles  of  truth  and  accuracy  apply  to  advertisements  conveyed  via  television,  radio,  magazines,  newspapers,  direct  mail,  telemarketing,  the  Internet,  or  oral 
 representations  made  by  customer  service  operators.  9 
 7  Id.  at  179,  quoting  FTC  v.  Sterling  Drug,  Inc.,  317  F.  2d  669,674  (2d  Cir.  1963). 
 8  The  law  does  not  require  that  every  item  of  information  that  might  be  useful  or  interesting  to  consumers  be  disclosed 


 in  advertising.  Only  information  necessary  to  prevent  consumer  deception  on  a  matter  of  importance  to  them  must  be  disclosed.  See  International  Harvester  Co.,  104  F.  T.  C.  949,  1059-  60  (1984). 


 9  The  FTC’s  Telemarketing  Sales  Rule,  (“  TSR”),  16  C.  F.  R.  Part  310,  provides  specific  provisions  on  what  constitute 
 material  misrepresentations  in  the  context  of  telemarketing,  and  what  material  information  must  be  disclosed  in  order  to  avoid  deceiving  consumers  through  telemarketing.  The  TSR  covers  all  “telemarketing”  --  defined  as  any  plan,  program, 


 or  campaign  to  sell  goods  or  services  through  interstate  telephone  calls.  It  applies  to  all  telemarketers,  regardless  of  on  whose  behalf  they  are  calling  or  what  product  or  service  they  are  selling,  even  telemarketing  companies  that  call  on 
 behalf  of  organizations  whose  activities  are  exempt  from  FTC  jurisdiction.  Coverage  of  the  Rule  extends  both  to  calls  placed  to  and  received  from  consumers,  so  long  as  the  calls  are  part  of  a  plan,  program,  or  campaign  to  sell  goods  or 
 services  through  interstate  telephone  calls.

 10.  In  issuing  this  Policy  Statement,  the  FCC  and  the  FTC  hope  to  provide  guidance  for  carriers  who  market  long-  distance  service.  As  a  matter  of  clarification,  we  note  that  this  Policy 
 Statement  does  not  preempt  existing  state  law. 


 II.  DISCUSSION 


 A.  MISREPRESENTATIONS  IN  ADVERTISEMENTS  FOR  LONG-  DISTANCE  CALLING  SERVICES 


 11.  As  a  general  matter,  advertisers  are  free  to  highlight  whatever  attribute  of  their  products  or  services  they  choose—  quality,  convenience,  customer  service,  availability,  price,  or 
 other  benefit.  However,  once  an  advertisement  makes  an  implied  or  express  objective  claim  that  conveys  a  material  representation  to  reasonable  consumers,  the  advertiser  is  responsible  for  the 
 truthfulness  of  the  representation  and  for  substantiating  the  representation,  regardless  of  whether  the  advertiser  intended  to  convey  those  messages  to  consumers.  If  a  claim  is  false,  a  disclosure 
 that  provides  contradictory  information  is  unlikely  to  cure  the  deception. 
 Example  #  1:  The  headline  of  a  direct  mail  ad  for  a  dial-  around  service  reads,  “All  day.  All  night.  All  calls.  10¢  a  minute.”  In  fact,  the  rate  is 
 applicable  only  for  state-  to-  state  calls  after  7:  00  p.  m.  and  on  weekends.  Even  an  otherwise  prominent  disclosure  to  that  effect  will  likely  not  be 
 sufficient  considering  that  the  disclosure  directly  contradicts  the  express,  and  false,  representations  in  the  headline. 


 B.  MATERIAL  INFORMATION  THAT  SHOULD  BE  DISCLOSED  IN  ADVERTISEMENTS  FOR  LONG-  DISTANCE  CALLING  SERVICES 


 12.  In  situations  where  an  advertisement  makes  claims  that  are  not  directly  false  but  might  be  misleading  in  the  absence  of  qualifying  or  limiting  information,  advertisers  are  responsible 
 both  for  making  any  necessary  disclosures  and  for  ensuring  that  they  are  clear  and  conspicuous.  The  following  are  some  of  the  types  of  disclosures  that  may  be  necessary  to  prevent  price  claims  in 
 long-  distance  telephone  advertising  from  deceiving  customers. 
 1.  Minimum  Per-  Call  Charges,  Monthly  Fees,  And  Other  Cost-  Related  Information 


 13.  The  central  characteristic  touted  in  most  long-  distance  advertising  is  price.  As  noted  above,  price  representations  are  presumptively  material  to  consumers.  What  matters  to  consumers 
 is  not  just  the  per-  minute  rate,  but  rather  how  that  rate,  along  with  all  additional  fees  and  charges, 
4
 Federal  Communications  Commission  FCC  00-  72  ________________________________________________________________________________ 
 5 
 will  ultimately  be  reflected  in  the  charges  they  see  on  their  monthly  phone  bills.  10  Therefore,  advertisers  should  exercise  the  greatest  care  in  ensuring  the  accuracy  of  their  claims  related  to  price, 
 including  the  clear  and  conspicuous  disclosure  11  of  information  such  as  minimum  per-  call  charges,  monthly  fees,  fees  for  additional  minutes  beyond  the  initial  calling  period,  and  other  information 
 that  significantly  affects  the  total  charge  of  a  particular  call  or  calling  plan  or  service. 
 Example  #2  --  Minimum  Charges:  An  advertisement  conveys  the  message  that  long-  distance  calls  cost  10¢  a  minute.  In  fact,  all  calls  are 
 subject  to  a  50¢  minimum  charge.  Given  that  reasonable  consumers  would  likely  conclude  from  the  “10¢  a  minute”  representation  that  a 
 one-  minute  call  would  cost  10¢,  and  would  not  expect  there  to  be  a  substantial  additional  charge,  the  advertiser’s  failure  to  clearly  and 
 conspicuously  disclose  the  minimum  fee  in  the  ad  would  likely  be  deceptive. 


 Example  #3  --  Monthly  Fees:  An  advertisement  says  that  long-  distance  calls  cost  10¢  a  minute.  In  fact,  that  rate  is  only  available  if  customers  pay 
 a  $5.95  monthly  fee.  Because  the  imposition  of  the  monthly  fee  would  significantly  increase  the  consumer’s  per-  minute  charge,  the  advertiser’s 
 failure  to  clearly  and  conspicuously  disclose  the  monthly  fee  in  the  ad  would  likely  be  deceptive. 


 Example  #4  --  Cost  After  Initial  Promoted  Calling  Period:  A  company  advertises  “all  calls  up  to  20  minutes  for  only  $1.00,”  but  charges  10¢  for 
 each  additional  minute.  Consumers  are  likely  to  be  misled  by  the  affirmative  claim  in  the  absence  of  a  disclosure  about  the  significantly 
 higher  rate  after  20  minutes.  Because  many  consumers  will  make  calls  that  last  longer  than  20  minutes,  the  cost  of  each  minute  beyond  the  first 
 20  minutes’  duration  of  a  call  is  information  that  likely  would  be  material  to  consumers  considering  whether  to  use  the  service.  Thus,  the 
 advertiser’s  failure  to  clearly  and  conspicuously  disclose  in  the  ad  the  per-minute  rate  for  calls  longer  than  the  initial  calling  period  would  likely  be 
 deceptive. 


 2.  Time  Restrictions  or  Limitations  on  the  Availability  of  the  Advertised  Rate 


 10  For  example,  if  a  consumer  paying  10¢  a  minute  and  a  $5.95  monthly  fee  places  100  minutes  of  calls  per  month,  his 
 or  her  total  would  be  $15.95  a  month  or  almost  16¢  per  minute.  This  figure  would  contrast  sharply  with  the  “10¢  a  minute”  rates  prominently  touted  in  typical  ads  for  long-  distance  calling  plans. 


 11  See  Section  III  for  a  discussion  of  the  factors  to  consider  in  assessing  whether  a  disclosure  is  “clear  and 
 conspicuous.” 
5

 6 
 14.  Given  the  importance  of  price  information,  any  significant  conditions  or  limitations  on  the  availability  of  the  advertised  rates  should  also  be  clearly  and  conspicuously  disclosed. 
 Examples  of  such  restrictions  would  include  limitations  on  the  time  of  day  or  day  of  the  week  that  the  rate  applies  or  the  fact  that  the  rate  is  good  only  during  a  limited  promotional  or  sale  period. 


 Example  #5  --  Time  Restrictions:  A  company’s  advertisements  prominently  feature  the  phrase  “10¢  a  minute.”  In  fact,  the  10¢  a  minute 
 rate  is  good  only  between  7:  00  p.  m.  and  7:  00  a.  m.  Consumers  are  likely  to  view  this  time  limitation  as  a  significant  restriction  on  the  availability  of 
 the  advertised  10¢  a  minute  rate.  The  advertiser’s  failure  to  clearly  and  conspicuously  disclose  the  limited  hours  in  the  ad  would  likely  be 
 deceptive. 
 Example  #6  --  Promotional  Rates:  A  company’s  advertisements  prominently  feature  the  phrase  “5¢  a  minute.”  Peel-  off  stickers,  intended 


 to  be  placed  on  the  phone,  featuring  the  “5¢  a  minute”  offer  accompany  the  advertisement.  In  fact,  the  5¢  a  minute  rate  is  a  special  promotional 
 offer  good  only  for  60  days.  Consumers  are  likely  to  view  the  limited  duration  of  the  5¢  a  minute  rate  as  a  significant  qualification.  The 
 advertiser’s  failure  to  clearly  and  conspicuously  disclose  this  limitation  in  the  ad  would  likely  be  deceptive.  Furthermore,  in  this  instance,  the  use  of 
 peel-  off  stickers  advertising  the  5¢  a  minute  rate  without  adequate  disclosure  of  the  limited  duration  of  the  offer  would  likely  be  deceptive 
 because  the  stickers  would  remain  on  consumers’  telephones  long  after  the  promotional  rate  had  expired. 


 3.  Geographic  Restrictions 
 15.  Another  important  qualification  that  would  likely  be  material  to  consumers  and  necessary  to  disclose  to  avoid  deception  is  a  significant  geographic  restriction  on  the  applicability 
 of  an  advertised  rate.  For  example,  many  long-  distance  services  and  plans  are  limited  to  state-  to-state  calls.  The  disclosure  of  this  information  is  particularly  important  because  in-  state  long-distance 
 rates  are  often  substantially  more  expensive  than  state-  to-  state  rates,  a  fact  that  may  be  surprising  and  significant  to  reasonable  consumers.  Where  reasonable  consumers  may  be  deceived 
 about  such  significant  differences  in  price  between  in-  state  and  state-  to-  state  calls,  the  advertiser  should  clearly  and  conspicuously  disclose  whether  the  advertised  service  includes  in-  state  calls,  and 
 the  fact  that  such  calls  are  charged  at  a  higher  rate,  if  such  is  the  case. 
 Example  #7  --  Geographic  Restrictions:  A  company  advertises  a  “10¢  a  minute”  rate.  In  fact,  that  rate  is  good  only  for  state-  to-  state  calls,  and  in-state 
 calls  may  be  charged  at  a  significantly  higher  rate.  The  failure  to  clearly  and  conspicuously  disclose  in  the  ad,  for  example,  that  “in  state 
6
 Federal  Communications  Commission  FCC  00-  72  ________________________________________________________________________________ 
 7 
 rates  may  be  higher,”  would  likely  be  deceptive. 
 4.  The  Use  of  the  Phrase  “Basic  Rates” 
 16.  Advertisers  should  also  exercise  care  to  adequately  explain  phrases  such  as  “basic  rates”  in  their  ads.  The  meaning  of  an  ad  is  evaluated  from  the  point  of  view  of  the  “reasonable 
 consumer”—  the  typical  person  looking  at  the  ad.  A  telecommunications  professional  may  understand  the  term  “basic  rate”  to  refer  to  a  specific  class  of  tariffed  service,  which  may  be  billed 
 at  the  most  expensive  rates.  However,  the  typical  consumer  would  likely  interpret  the  phrase  differently,  concluding  that  it  refers  to  the  discounted  rates  he  or  she  is  normally  charged  by  his  or 
 her  selected  carrier.  Therefore,  when  making  claims  using  such  terms  as  “basic  rates”  or  “regular  rates,”  advertisers  should  be  mindful  that  those  terms  will  be  evaluated  from  the  point  of  view  of  the 
 reasonable  consumer,  and  may  be  deceptive. 
 Example  #8  --  “Basic  Rates”:  A  company  offers  consumers  a  directory  assistance  service  for  99¢.  According  to  the  television  ad,  callers  who  use 
 this  service  can  be  connected  to  the  requested  number  at  no  additional  charge.  In  fact,  consumers  who  opt  to  be  connected  to  the  requested 
 number  are  connected  via  the  advertiser’s  network  and  are  billed  at  the  advertiser’s  expensive  per-  minute  rates.  This  information  is  disclosed 
 only  by  a  superscript  reading  “basic  rates  apply.”  Reasonable  consumers  would  expect  to  pay  the  promoted  99¢  charge,  but  would  not  likely  expect 
 to  pay  a  charge  greater  than  the  amount  their  selected  long-  distance  carrier  would  charge  for  a  call  to  the  requested  number.  Because  the  consumer 
 will  be  charged  a  rate  higher  than  the  consumer’s  presubscribed  rate,  use  of  the  term  “basic  rates  apply,”  even  if  clearly  and  conspicuously 
 disclosed,  would  not  likely  be  sufficient  to  avoid  deception.  The  advertiser’s  failure  to  disclose  that  the  consumer  will  be  charged  a  rate 
 higher  than  the  consumer’s  presubscribed  rate  would  likely  be  deceptive. 


 5.  Comparative  Price  Claims 
 17.  A  technique  commonly  employed  in  long-  distance  advertising  is  the  comparison  of  an  advertiser’s  price  to  the  prices  of  its  competitors.  By  representing  a  competitor’s  rates,  an 
 advertiser  is  making  an  implied  claim  that  these  rates  are  reasonably  current.  As  in  the  case  of  any  other  objective  claim,  the  advertiser  must  have  a  reasonable  basis  for  this  representation.  The  time 
 elapsing  between  the  creation  of  an  ad  and  the  distribution  of  the  ad  to  the  public  may  vary,  depending  upon  the  medium  in  which  the  ad  appears.  This  is  a  consideration  in  determining 
 whether  an  advertiser  possesses  a  reasonable  basis  for  a  claim  that  compared  rates  are  reasonably  current. 
7
 Federal  Communications  Commission  FCC  00-  72  ________________________________________________________________________________ 
 8 
 Example  #9  --  Comparative  Price  Claims:  In  an  advertisement  in  a  daily  newspaper,  an  advertiser  conveys  the  message  that  its  rates  are  the 
 lowest,  using  a  chart  that  compares  its  per-  minute  rate  to  the  rates  offered  by  two  competitors.  The  stated  rates  of  one  of  the  competitors  are  three 
 months  old,  and  the  stated  rate  of  the  other  is  eight  months  old.  By  representing  the  competitors’  rates,  the  advertiser  is  implying  that  those 
 rates  are  reasonably  current.  If  the  information  upon  which  the  ad  is  based  is  outdated  and  the  rates  have  changed  materially,  the  ad  would  likely  be 
 deceptive. 


 Example  #10  --  Comparative  Price  Claims:  An  advertisement  in  a  monthly  magazine  states  that  the  advertiser’s  rates  are  better  than  those  of 
 another  competitor.  In  January  the  advertiser  verified  that  the  competitor  was  offering  the  rate  as  stated  in  the  ad.  When  the  ad  is  published  in 
 February,  it  clearly  and  conspicuously  discloses  that  the  competitor’s  rate  is  as  of  January  of  this  year.  This  disclosure  is  likely  to  be  sufficient  to 
 avoid  deception. 


 6.  The  Effect  of  the  Use  of  Toll-  Free  Numbers  and  Other  Alternate  Sources  of  Information 


 18.  The  fact  that  information  about  significant  limitations  or  restrictions  on  advertised  prices  may  be  available  by  calling  a  toll-  free  number  or  a  clicking  on  a  Web  site  is  generally 
 insufficient  to  cure  an  otherwise  deceptive  price  claim  in  advertising.  Advertisers  are  encouraged  to  use  customer  service  numbers  and  Internet  sites  to  offer  consumers  more  information,  but  these 
 sources  cannot  cure  misleading  information  in  the  ad  itself.  12 
 19.  Dial-  around  services  are  unique  in  that  consumers  typically  incur  charges  for  using  them  before  receiving  any  information  other  than  what  is  conveyed  in  the  dial-  around  service’s 
 advertising.  This  underscores  the  importance  that  significant  restrictions  and  limitations  on  price  claims  be  disclosed  in  the  ad  itself;  users  of  those  services  must  rely  on  the  information  contained  in 
 the  ad  as  the  basis  for  determining  whether  to  choose  a  particular  service.  However,  even  if  the  use  of  an  advertised  service  requires  a  consumer  to  interact  further  with  the  advertiser—  for  example,  if 
 a  consumer  must  call  a  toll-  free  customer  service  number  to  switch  to  a  different  calling  plan—  it  would  still  be  deceptive  if  the  advertisement  failed  to  disclose  significant  restrictions  necessary  to

 qualify  representations  made  in  the  ad. 
 Example  #11  --  Use  of  Toll-  Free  Numbers:  A  television  advertisement  for  a  long-  distance  calling  plan  prominently  features  the  phrase  “10¢  a 
 minute”  as  a  graphic  and  in  the  narration  read  by  the  spokesperson.  The  ad  gives  a  toll-  free  number  and  tells  consumers  “call  now  to  switch.”  In 
 fact,  the  10¢  a  minute  rate  is  good  only  between  7:  00  p.  m.  and  7:  00  a.  m.  The  inclusion  of  a  superscript  that  reads  “call  for  restrictions”  would  not 
 likely  be  effective  to  qualify  the  claim. 


 C.  PRINCIPLES  RELATED  TO  THE  CLEAR  AND  CONSPICUOUS  DISCLOSURE  OF  MATERIAL  INFORMATION  IN  ADVERTISEMENTS  FOR  LONG-  DISTANCE 
 CALLING  SERVICES 


 20.  When  the  disclosure  of  qualifying  information  is  necessary  to  prevent  an  ad  from  being  deceptive,  that  information  should  be  presented  clearly  and  prominently  so  that  it  is  actually 
 noticed  and  understood  by  consumers.  Disclosures  should  be  effectively  communicated  to  consumers.  A  fine-  print  disclosure  at  the  bottom  of  a  print  ad,  a  disclaimer  buried  in  a  body  of  text 
 unrelated  to  the  claim  being  qualified,  a  brief  video  superscript  in  a  television  ad,  or  a  disclaimer  that  is  easily  missed  on  an  Internet  Web  site  is  not  likely  to  be  effective.  To  ensure  that  disclosures 
 are  effective,  advertisers  should  use  clear  and  unambiguous  language,  avoid  small  type,  place  any  qualifying  information  close  to  the  claim  being  qualified,  and  avoid  making  inconsistent  statements 
 or  using  distracting  elements  that  could  undercut  or  contradict  the  disclosure. 
 21.  In  some  cases,  the  FTC  has  specified  the  precise  fashion  in  which  qualifying  disclosures  must  be  conveyed.  13  However,  more  frequently,  the  FTC  has  used  the  term  “clear  and 
 conspicuous”  to  describe  a  general  performance  standard  flexible  enough  to  take  into  account  both  the  consumer’s  right  to  accurate  information  necessary  to  make  an  informed  purchase  decision  and 
 the  many  ways  that  creative  advertisers  can  effectively  convey  that  information.  14  Because  the  FTC  considers  the  disclosure  in  the  context  of  all  of  the  elements  of  the  ad,  the  focus  is  not  on  the 
 wording  of  the  specific  disclosure  in  isolation,  but  rather  on  the  overall  or  “net”  impression  that  the  entire  advertisement—  including  the  disclosure—  conveys  to  reasonable  consumers.  15 


 22.  Ordinarily,  a  disclosure  is  “clear  and  conspicuous,”  and  therefore  is  effectively  communicated,  when  it  is  displayed  in  a  manner  that  is  readily  noticeable,  readable  and/  or  audible, 
 13  See,  e.  g.,  Regulations  Under  the  Comprehensive  Smokeless  Tobacco  Health  Education  Act  of  1986,  16  C.  F.  R.  §  307. 
 14  The  FTC  has  also  used  phrases  such  as  “clear  and  prominent”  and  “of  sufficient  clarity  and  conspicuousness”  to 
 articulate  the  same  concept.  63  Fed.  Reg.  25002,  FTC’s  Notice  Seeking  Comment  on  the  Interpretation  of  FTC  Rules  and  Guides  for  Electronic  Media  (May  6,  1998).

 10 
 and  understandable  to  the  audience  to  whom  it  is  disseminated.  Factors  that  the  FTC  considers  in  evaluating  the  effectiveness  of  disclosures  include: 
 €  the  prominence  of  the  qualifying  information,  especially  in  comparison  to  the  advertising  representation  itself; 
 €  the  proximity  and  placement  of  the  qualifying  information  vis-  a-  vis  the  representation  that  it  modifies; 
 €  the  absence  of  distracting  elements,  such  as  text,  graphics,  or  sound  that  may  distract  a  consumer’s  attention  away  from  the  disclosure;  and 
 €  the  clarity  and  understandability  of  the  text  of  the  disclosure.  16 
 23.  Reference  to  an  existing  regulatory  scheme  provides  considerable  guidance.  In  1992  Congress  passed  the  Telephone  Disclosure  and  Dispute  Resolution  Act  (“  TDDRA”),  directing  the 
 FCC  and  the  FTC  to  issue  regulations  governing,  among  other  things,  the  advertising  and  marketing  of  pay-  per-  call  services.  TDDRA  was  enacted  in  response  to  a  history  of  fraudulent  or  abusive 
 practices.  In  adopting  its  Pay-  Per-  Call  Rule  (previously  called  the  900-  Number  Rule),  17  the  FTC  provided  very  specific  provisions  on  how  to  make  effective  disclosures  of  material  cost  information 
 in  the  context  of  advertising  telephone-  based  entertainment  or  information  programs  that  are  billed  to  consumers’  telephone  bills.  The  basic  principles  embodied  in  the  advertising  provisions  of  the 
 Rule  show  how  the  FTC  determines  whether  a  particular  disclosure  of  cost  information  is  clear  and  conspicuous  in  the  context  of  advertising  for  pay-  per-  call  services.  According  to  the  Rule’s 
 provisions  governing  the  advertising  of  those  services,  the  provider  must  “clearly  and  conspicuously”  disclose  in  the  advertisement  the  total  cost  of  the  call.  If  there  is  a  flat  fee  for  the 
 call,  the  ad  must  state  the  total  cost.  If  the  call  is  billed  on  a  time-  sensitive  basis,  the  ad  must  state  “the  cost  per  minute  and  any  minimum  charges.”  If  the  call  is  billed  on  a  variable  rate  basis,  the  ad 
 must  state  the  cost  of  the  initial  portion  of  the  call,  any  minimum  charges,  and  the  range  of  rates  that  may  be  charged  for  the  service  including  any  other  fees  that  will  be  charged  for  the  service. 
 Regardless  of  how  the  service  is  billed,  the  Rule  requires  that  “the  advertisement  shall  disclose  any  other  fees  that  will  be  charged  for  the  service.”

 24.  To  ensure  that  consumers  understand  the  central  factor  in  the  transaction—  the  cost  of  the  call—  the  Rule  specifies  that  all  necessary  disclosures  must  be  made  clearly  and 
 conspicuously.  Initially,  the  Rule  specifies  that  these  disclosures  must  be  made  in  the  same  language  as  the  advertisement;  for  print  disclosures,  “in  a  color  or  shade  that  readily  contrasts  with 
 the  background  of  the  ad”;  and  for  oral  disclosures,  “in  a  slow  and  deliberate  manner  and  in  a  reasonably  understandable  volume.”  However,  the  Rule  outlines  with  more  specificity  the  required 
 type  size  of  these  disclosures,  their  proximity  to  the  triggering  information,  and  the  necessity  of  both  oral  and  visual  disclosures  for  television  ads. 


 25.  In  print  advertisements,  the  FTC  Rule  requires: 
 1)  that  the  cost  of  the  call  shall  be  placed  adjacent  to  each  presentation  of  the  pay-  per-  call  number;  and 


 2)  that  each  letter  or  numeral  of  any  necessary  price  disclosures  shall  be,  “at  a  minimum,  one-  half  the  size  of  each  letter  or  numeral  of  the  pay-  per-  call 
 number  to  which  the  disclosure  is  adjacent.” 
 26.  For  television  advertisements,  the  FTC  Rule  requires: 
 1)  that  a  visual  disclosure  shall  appear  adjacent  to  each  visual  presentation  of  the  pay-  per-  call  number; 


 2)  that  each  letter  or  numeral  of  any  necessary  price  disclosures  shall  be,  “at  a  minimum,  one-  half  the  size  of  each  letter  or  numeral  of  the  pay-  per-  call 
 number  to  which  the  disclosure  is  adjacent;” 
 3)  that  a  visual  disclosure  shall  appear  on  the  screen  for  the  duration  of  the  presentation  of  the  pay-  per-  call  number;  and 


 4)  that  an  oral  disclosure  shall  be  made  at  least  once,  simultaneously  with  a  visual  presentation  of  the  disclosure. 
 27.  The  measures  that  the  FTC  thought  were  necessary  to  ensure  that  cost  disclosures  were  clear  and  conspicuous  in  the  context  of  pay-  per-  call  services—  the  prominent  disclosure  of 
 important  cost  information  adjacent  to  the  central  feature  of  the  ad—  are  certainly  relevant  to  price  advertising  by  dial-  around  services  and  long-  distance  calling  plans.  While  not  every  single  aspect 
 of  the  Rule  may  be  appropriate  or  required  to  ensure  truthful,  nondeceptive  advertising  by  the  long-distance  telephone  industry,  the  Rule  nonetheless  offers  guidance  and  a  set  of  “best  practices”  to 
 advertisers  of  dial-  around  and  other  long-  distance  telephone  services. 
 1.  Prominence 
11

 12 
 28.  Disclosures  that  are  large  in  size,  are  emphasized  through  a  sharply  contrasting  color,  and,  in  the  case  of  television  advertisements,  remain  visible  and/  or  audible  for  a  sufficiently 
 long  duration  are  likely  to  be  more  effective  than  those  lacking  such  prominence.  The  FTC’s  experience  consistently  demonstrates  that  fine-  print  footnotes  and  brief  video  superscripts  are  often 
 overlooked.  For  example,  in  concluding  that  a  television  superscript  was  insufficiently  clear  and  conspicuous  to  qualify  a  nutritional  claim  in  a  food  ad,  the  FTC  stated,  “[  g]  enerally  recognized 
 marketing  principles  suggest  that,  given  the  distracting  visual  and  audio  elements  and  the  brief  appearance  of  the  complex  superscript  in  the  middle  of  the  commercial,  it  is  unlikely  that  the  visual 
 disclosure  is  effective  as  a  corrective  measure.”  18 
 29.  The  FTC’s  analysis  focuses  not  just  on  whether  the  type  size  of  the  disclosure  is  large  enough  to  be  readable  when  read  in  isolation,  but  rather  whether  the  disclosure  itself  is 
 prominent  enough  so  that  typical  consumers  will  actually  read  and  understand  it  in  the  context  of  an  actual  ad.  Although  the  FTC  has  not,  as  a  general  rule,  required  disclosures  to  be  identical  in 
 size  and  repeated  the  same  number  of  times  as  the  triggering  representation,  substantial  disparities  between  the  two  reduce  the  likelihood  that  a  disclosure  will  be  clear  and  conspicuous. 


 Example  #  12:  In  a  full-  page  newspaper  ad  for  a  long-  distance  calling  plan,  the  phrase  “10¢  a  minute”  appears  in  70-  point  type  at  the  top  of  the 
 page.  In  fact,  the  advertised  10¢  a  minute  rate  applies  only  with  a  $3.95  monthly  fee.  The  fee  is  disclosed  in  the  body  of  the  ad  in  12-  point  type. 
 Given  the  disparity  in  type  size  between  the  “10¢  a  minute”  claim  and  the  $3.95  monthly  fee,  it  is  unlikely  that  the 
 disclosure  of  the  monthly  fee  is  sufficiently  clear  and  conspicuous  to  avoid  deception. 


 Example  #  13:  In  a  30-  second  television  ad  for  a  dial-  around  service,  the  phrase  “10¢  a  minute”  is  used  four  times  by  the  narrator  and  appears  as  a 
 graphic  twice.  A  superscript  appearing  on  the  bottom  of  the  screen  for  three  seconds  reads  “Rate  available  from  7:  00  p.  m.  until  7:  00  a.  m., 
 Monday  through  Friday  and  all  day  weekends.”  In  fact,  calls  before  7:  00  p.  m.  cost  25¢  per  minute.  Given  the  prominence  of  the  “10¢  a  minute” 
 claim  and  the  complexity  and  small  print  of  the  superscript,  it  is  unlikely  that  the  disclosure  of  the  time  restrictions  is  sufficiently  clear  and 
 conspicuous  to  avoid  deception. 
 Example  #  14:  In  a  full-  page  newspaper  ad  for  a  long-  distance  calling  plan,  the  phrase  “10¢  a  minute”  appears  in  70-  point  type  at  the  top  of  the

 page.  Immediately  under  it,  the  phrase  “plus  $3.95  monthly  fee”  appears  in  35-  point  type.  Given  the  proportional  similarity  in  type  size  between 
 the  “10¢  a  minute”  claim  and  the  $3.95  monthly  fee  and  their  proximity,  the  disclosure  of  the  monthly  fee  is  likely  to  be  sufficient  to  avoid 
 deception. 
 2.  Proximity  and  Placement 
 30.  In  addition  to  their  size  and  duration,  the  proximity  and  placement  of  disclosures  are  important  factors  in  determining  whether  they  are  clear  and  conspicuous.  The  effectiveness  of 
 disclosures  is  ordinarily  enhanced  by  their  proximity  to  the  representation  they  qualify,  because  reasonable  consumers  do  not  necessarily  read  an  ad  in  its  entirety.  19  The  placement  of  qualifying 
 information  away  from  the  triggering  representation—  for  example,  in  footnotes,  in  margins,  or  on  a  separate  page  of  a  multi-  page  promotion—  reduces  the  effectiveness  of  the  disclosure.  20 
 Furthermore,  when  significant  qualifying  information  about  the  cost  of  a  long-  distance  plan  or  service  is  necessary  to  prevent  the  ad  from  misleading  consumers,  the  use  of  an  asterisk  will 
 generally  be  considered  insufficient  to  draw  a  consumer’s  attention  to  a  disclosure  placed  elsewhere  in  an  ad.  21 


 Example  #15:  A  full-  page  newspaper  advertisement  for  a  company’s  long-  distance  calling  plan  features  in  70-  point  type  the  statement,  “7¢  a 
 minute  all  the  time”  followed  by  an  asterisk.  A  12-  point  disclosure  at  the  bottom  of  the  page  states,  “*$  5.95  monthly  fee  applies.”  Given  the 
 disparity  in  prominence  and  location  between  the  two  lines  of  text,  it  is  unlikely  that  the  disclosure  of  the  monthly  fee  is  sufficiently  clear  and 
 conspicuous. 
 Example  #  16:  A  dial-  around  company  promotes  its  services  via  a  three-page  direct  mail  letter  sent  to  consumers.  The  envelope  includes  a

 depiction  of  a  nickel  surrounded  by  the  phrase  “long-  distance  calls  for  just  5¢  a  minute,”  a  depiction  repeated  on  the  first  page  of  the  letter.  In  fact, 
 the  5¢  a  minute  rate  is  good  only  for  state-  to-  state  calls  20  minutes  or  longer.  That  information  is  prominently  disclosed  only  on  the  last  page  of 
 the  letter.  The  disclosure  of  these  material  conditions  on  the  third  page  of  the  letter  would  likely  be  ineffective. 


 Example  #  17:  In  a  60-  second  television  ad,  a  company  wants  to  promote  both  its  domestic  and  international  dial-  around  service.  In  the  first  50 
 seconds  of  the  ad,  the  spokesperson  refers  to  the  company’s  rate  as  “7¢  a  minute”  three  times  with  an  accompanying  graphic.  In  the  last  10  seconds 
 of  the  ad,  the  spokesperson  says,  “And  call  878-  555-  0000  to  find  out  about  our  low  international  rates.”  During  the  10-  second  segment  in 
 which  the  spokesperson  discusses  the  company’s  international  rates,  the  superscript  appears  “7¢  a  minute  rate  applies  after  7:  00  p.  m.  Monday-Friday 
 and  all  day  weekends.”  Given  the  lack  of  proximity  between  the  “7¢  a  minute”  claim  and  the  disclosure  of  the  material  time  restriction,  the 
 superscript  would  likely  not  be  considered  clear  and  conspicuous. 
 Example  #  18:  A  company  wants  to  promote  its  international  long-  distance  service  by  reducing  its  regular  prices  during  a  special 
 promotional  period.  The  print  ad  features  the  prominent  headline,  “Big  holiday  sale!  Call  between  November  1,  2000,  and  December  31,  2000, 
 and  save  on  all  international  calls.”  The  ad  also  features  a  box  listing  ten  foreign  cities.  The  list,  prominently  headed  “sale  prices  good  through 
 December  31,  2000”  gives  the  cost  per  minute  to  each  of  the  advertised  cities.  Considering  the  close  proximity  between  the  promotional  per-minute 
 rates  and  the  prominently  displayed  information  that  the  advertised  rates  are  good  only  until  December  31,  2000,  the  disclosure  would  likely 
 be  effective. 
 3.  Absence  of  Distracting  Elements 
 31.  Even  if  a  disclosure  is  large  in  size  and  long  in  duration,  other  elements  of  an  advertisement  may  distract  consumers  so  that  they  may  fail  to  notice  the  disclosure.  As  the  FTC 
 has  held,  consumers  may  be  “directed  away  from  the  importance  of  the  qualifying  phrase  by  the  acts  or  statements  of  the  seller.”  22  Advertisers  should  take  care  not  to  undercut  the  effectiveness  of 
 disclosures  by  placing  them  in  competition  with  other  arresting  elements  of  the  ad.

 Example  #19:  A  30-  second  television  advertisement  for  a  dial-  around  service  features  a  famous  movie  star  as  a  spokesperson.  On  three 
 occasions,  the  celebrity  states  that  calls  completed  through  this  service  cost  10¢  a  minute.  The  ad  closes  with  a  quick-  cut  montage  of  the 
 celebrity  talking  on  the  telephone  in  front  of  the  Grand  Canyon,  Niagara  Falls,  Golden  Gate  Bridge,  and  other  visually  arresting  national 
 landmarks.  In  fact,  calls  are  subject  to  a  50¢  minimum.  This  information  is  disclosed  only  through  a  visual  superscript  appearing  at  the  bottom  of 
 the  screen  during  the  montage.  Given  the  likelihood  that  consumers  will  focus  on  the  quick-  cut  montage  rather  than  on  the  superscript,  it  is 
 unlikely  that  the  disclosure  would  be  considered  clear  and  conspicuous. 


 4.  Factors  Relating  Specifically  to  Television  Ads 
 32.  In  television  ads,  the  same  factors  of  prominence,  proximity,  and  absence  of  distractions  determine  whether  material  information  is  disclosed  in  a  manner  that  consumers  notice 
 and  understand.  Other  considerations  specific  to  television  ads  include  volume,  cadence,  and  placement  of  any  audio  disclosures.  23  Disclosures  generally  are  more  effective  when  they  are  made 
 in  the  same  mode  (visual  or  oral)  in  which  the  claim  necessitating  the  disclosure  is  presented.  Furthermore,  research  suggests  that  disclosures  that  are  made  simultaneously  in  both  visual  and 
 audio  modes  generally  are  more  effectively  communicated  than  disclosures  made  in  either  mode  alone.  24  For  example,  the  FTC’s  Pay-  Per-  Call  Rule  requires  that  the  price  of  a  call  to  a  900-  number 
 service  be  disclosed  in  both  the  video  and  audio  in  a  television  ad.  Thus,  for  television  ads  for  long-distance  services,  a  disclosure  that  includes  both  a  sufficiently  large  superscript  and  a  voice-  over 
 statement  is  likely  to  be  more  effective  than  a  superscript  alone. 
 Example  #20:  A  30-  second  television  advertisement  for  a  long-  distance  calling  plan  features  a  spokesperson  who  on  three  occasions  states  that

 calls  on  the  plan  are  “10¢  a  minute  anytime.”  In  addition,  a  graphic  reading  “10¢  a  minute  anytime”  is  depicted  twice  during  the  ad.  In  fact, 
 the  10¢  a  minute  rate  requires  the  payment  of  a  $5.95  monthly  fee.  The  only  disclosure  of  the  monthly  fee  is  through  a  visual  superscript  at  the 
 end  of  the  ad.  Especially  because  the  triggering  representation—  that  calls  on  the  plan  are  “10¢  a  minute  anytime”—  was  made  both  orally  and 
 visually,  the  visual  superscript  would  likely  be  less  effective  in  disclosing  the  monthly  fee  than  had  the  same  information  been  conveyed  both  orally 
 and  visually.

 DISSENTING  STATEMENT  OF  COMMISSIONER  HAROLD  FURCHTGOTT-  ROTH 
 Re:  Joint  FCC/  FTC  Policy  Statement  for  the  Advertising  of  Dial-  Around  and  Other  Long  Distance  Services  to  Consumers  File  No.  (Rel.  March  1,  2000). 


 Today’s  action  marks  another  unfortunate  stop  in  the  majority’s  self-  defined  jurisdictional  mission  to  “do  good.”  Regardless  of  how  tenuous  our  statutory  authority  may  be,  or  the  potential 
 adverse  collateral  consequences,  the  majority  boldly  goes  where  no  Commission  has  gone  before  in  an  effort  to  “do  good.”  Such  an  agile  jurisdictional  approach  makes  it  politically  difficult  to 
 dissent.  Needless  to  say,  I  am  not  against  doing  “good.”  More  specifically,  I  am  not  against  efforts  to  eliminate  fraudulent  or  misleading  advertising.  Yet  our  inquiry  simply  cannot  stop  with  whether 
 we  are  doing  “good”--  to  do  so  would  be  to  abdicate  our  responsibility  to  the  American  people.  We  were  hired  to  do  a  pretty  daunting  job:  administer  and  enforce  the  Communications  Act.  When  we 
 act  outside  our  job  description,  our  “moonlighting”  is  not  only  questionable  as  a  matter  of  law,  it  shortchanges  the  American  people  on  the  job  they  hired  us  to  do. 


 An  Effort  to  Do  Good 
 Certain  carriers’  marketing  may  be  confusing,  misleading,  or  even  fraudulent.  I  share  the  desire  to  see  this  advertising  curtailed.  I  also  understand  that  the  Federal  Trade  Commission  lacks  authority 
 over  advertising  practices  by  certain  industries,  including  common  carriers,  under  15  U.  S.  C.  §§  45,  46.  1  In  light  of  the  perceived  problem  and  the  lack  of  FTC  authority,  the  majority  is  responding  to 
 a  perceived  “gap”  in  federal  regulatory  authority  over  common  carrier  advertising.  However,  it  is  not  obvious  that  this  “gap”  is  filled  by  the  plain  language  of  the  Communications  Act.  It  is 
 possible  that  there  are  many  instances  when  pressing  issues  are  not  addressed  by  current  federal  law.  But  it  is  the  exclusive  responsibility  of  Congress,  not  the  FCC,  to  assess  these  issues  and  to  fill 
 in  any  “gaps”  by  changing  the  law. 
 The  FCC’s  Tenuous  Jurisdiction  Over  Advertising 
 The  Statement  asserts  FCC  authority  over  advertising  based  on  47  U.  S.  C.  §  201(  b).  That  Section  “requires  that  common  carriers’  practices  .  .  .  for  and  in  connection  with  .  .  .  communication 
 service,  shall  be  just  and  reasonable  .  .  .  .”  The  Statement  then  contends  that  advertising  qualifies  as  a  “practice”  under  the  statute.  As  an  initial  matter,  the  plain  meaning  of  the  term  “practices”  taken 


 1  15  U.  S.  C.  §§  45(  a)(  2),  46(  a),  46  (b).  This  enabling  statute  otherwise  empowering  the  FTC  clearly  has  exceptions 
 regarding  regulation  of  common  carriers.  The  case  of  FTC  v.  Miller,  549  F.  2d  452  (7  th  Cir.  1977),  squarely  applied  this  exception  to  misleading  advertising  by  common  carriers. 
18

 19 
 in  the  context  of  Section  201  does  not  clearly  reach  advertising.  This  is  particularly  true  in  light  of  Congress’  ability  and  practice  of  crafting  explicit  “advertising”  jurisdiction  over  common  carrier 
 services  when  its  desires  such  jurisdiction.  For  example,  Congress  has  specifically  granted  the  FTC  jurisdiction  over  “advertisement[  s]  for  pay-  per-  call  services.”  2  In  the  end,  if  the  majority 
 reads  “practices”  to  include  advertising,  it  is  difficult  to  discern  what  the  term  does  not  include.  For  example,  are  telephone  company  labor  and  employment  policies  “practices”  under  the  Act?  What 
 about  the  use  of  energy  efficient  equipment,  is  that  a  “practice”? 
 The  questionable  nature  of  our  authority  in  this  area  is  best  illustrated  by  our  own  experiences.  Despite  the  statute’s  sixty-  five  years  on  the  books,  the  Statement  cites  only  two  cases  in  which  the 
 Commission  has  equated  “practices”  with  advertising.  3  This  lack  of  precedent  alone  demonstrates  what  a  significant  step  these  guidelines  represent  in  expanding  the  reach  of  the  Commission’s 
 authority.  4  It  is  one  thing  to  nibble  on  the  edges  of  advertising  regulation  (as  these  cases  arguably  did);  it  is  quite  another  to  enter  into  that  arena  full  stride  after  sixty-  five  years  of  dormancy.  5 


 Courts  Have  Been  Reluctant  to  View  Section  201’s  “Practices”  Language  to  Include  Advertising 
 Courts  have  also  called  into  doubt  the  majority’s  interpretation  of  Section  201.  Although  the  jurisdictional  issue  has  never  been  squarely  presented,  courts  have  examined  the  scope  of  the  FCC’s 
 advertising  authority  in  the  context  of  various  state  preemption  cases.  While  the  legal  analyses  in  these  cases  are  distinguishable,  the  decisions  illustrate  the  facial  weaknesses  in  our  jurisdictional 
 assertions.  For  example,  a  federal  district  court  in  New  Jersey  concluded  that  “Sections  201,  202,  and  203  of  the  Communications  Act  impose  no  duty  on  common  carriers  to  make  accurate  and 


 2  See  15  U.  S.  C.  §  5711. 
 3  Both  cases  were  within  the  last  ten  years,  and  neither  was  appealed  on  this  issue.  As  shown  below,  both  cases 
 may  be  best  described  in  terms  other  than  as  advertising  complaints. 


 4  The  first  case  cited  by  the  item  is  the  Business  Discount  Plan  decision  from  last  year.  14  FCC  Rcd  340  (1998). 
 That  decision  represents  the  only  clear  assertion  of  Commission  authority  over  advertising  under  Section  201.  However,  even  in  that  case,  the  advertising  claim  arose  out  of  telemarketing  based  slamming  complaints  –  an  area  in 


 which  we  have  clear  jurisdiction  under  47  U.  S.  C.  §  258.  I  believe  Business  Discount  Plans  can  best  be  interpreted  as  an  indication  that  deceptive  advertising  that  results  in  illegal  activity  may  aggravate  such  conduct.  However,  it  is  a 
 different  exercise  to  suggest  that  we  will  now  monitor  all  advertising  –  an  area  in  which  we  have  little,  if  any  expertise  --  and  punish  any  misleading  conduct  as  conduct  alone.  The  second  case  cited  in  the  Statement,  AT&  T  71  RR2d  775 
 (1992)  is  even  weaker.  AT&  T  did  not  find  any  violation  of  Section  201(  b)  and  the  “letter  of  admonishment”  was  issued  under  Section  4(  i). 


 5  I  also  continue  to  object  to  the  agency’s  persistent  use  of  “Policy  Statements”  rather  than  rules  to  implement 
 new  regulatory  policies.  By  removing  these  issues  from  the  rigors  of  the  Administrative  Procedure  Act,  we  eliminate  the  opportunity  for  interested  parties  to  participate  in  the  policy  development  process  and  shield  these  decisions  from 


 judicial  review.

 authentic  representations  in  their  promotional  practices.  .  .  ”  6  In  holding  that  state  law  advertising  claims  could  go  forward  against  a  carrier,  the  Second  Circuit  similarly  held  that  “while  the 
 [Communications  Act]  does  provide  some  causes  of  action  for  customers,  it  provides  none  for  deceptive  advertisement  and  billing.”  7  That  court  concluded  that  the  Act  “does  not  indicate  a 
 uniquely  federal  interest  .  .  .  in  preventing  a  carrier  from  misrepresenting  the  nature  of  its  rates  to  its  customers.”  8  The  Seventh  Circuit’s  message  to  the  FTC  in  Miller  is  equally  applicable  to  the  FCC 
 here:  “The  regulatory  approach  articulated  by  the  Commission,  while  it  may  be  a  desirable  one,  is  not  the  one  Congress  appears  to  have  adopted.”  9 


 Although  I  am  heartened  by  the  Statement’s  assertion  that  it  “does  not  preempt  existing  state  law,”  I  am  also  concerned  that  today’s  decision  may  cast  doubt  on  state  authority  in  this  area.  As  one 
 district  court  held,  “[  t]  he  savings  clause  of  the  Communications  Act  must  be  read  to  preserve  only  state  claims  that  address  obligations  different  from  those  created  by  the  Communications  Act.”  10 
 Our  action  today  suggests  that  the  Communications  Act  creates  an  obligation  regarding  truthful  advertising  –  potentially  creating  uncertainty  regarding  state  law  claims  in  this  area. 


 I  also  want  to  point  out  that  it  appears  that  the  states  have  done  an  adequate  job  in  this  area.  Thus,  it  is  not  clear  from  a  policy  or  consumer  perspective  that  our  intervention  is  necessary. 


 The  Pay-  Per-  Call  Experience 
 Recent  Congressional  action  further  illustrates  the  misguided  nature  of  today’s  action.  In  1992,  Congress  passed  the  “Telephone  Disclosure  and  Dispute  Resolution  Act"  to 
 address  the  problems  created  by  900  pay-  per-  call  services.  Those  issues  were  not  unlike  the 


 6  Weinberg  v.  Sprint  Corp,  165  F.  R.  D.  431  (D.  N.  J.  1996),  appeal  dismissed,  Civ.  No.  96-  354  (AMW)(  May  23, 
 1996).  Similarly,  other  courts  have  held  that  the  Communications  Act  does  not  provide  a  remedy  for  failure  of  advertising  to  fully  disclose  certain  components  of  services,  or  even  fraudulent  advertising.  See  DeCastro  v.  AWACS, 


 935  F.  Supp.  541  (D.  N.  J.  1996);  In  re  Long  Distance  Telecommunications  Litig.,  831  F.  2d  627  (6  th  Cir.  1987). 
 7  Marcus  v.  AT&  T,  138  F.  3d  46,  54  (2d  Cir.  1998).

 9  FTC  v.  Miller,  549  F.  2d  452  (7  th  Cir.  1977)  (holding  the  FTC  had  no  authority  to  regulate  common  carriers 
 who  were  then  regulated  by  the  Interstate  Commerce  Act.)  So,  under  Miller  the  FTC  has  no  authority  in  the  area  of  common  carriers  and  under  the  Communications  Act  the  FCC  does  not  have  clear  authority  either.  Joint  statements 


 from  the  impotent  agencies  cannot  resolve  this  conundrum. 
 10  See  Marcus  v.  AT&  T  Corp.,  938  F.  Supp.  1158,  1168  (S.  D.  N.  Y.  1996),  aff’d,  138  F.  3d  46  (2d  Cir.  1998);  see 
 also  Comtronics  Inc.  v.  Puerto  Rico  Telephone  Company,  553  F.  2d  701,  707  n.  6  (1  st  Cir.  1977).  The  Commission  has  recently  affirmed  the  availability  of  state  claims  in  this  area.  See  Southwestern  Bell  Mobile  Systems,  FCC  99-  356  (Nov.

 customer  concerns  that  today’s  Statement  is  designed  to  address.  Yet  when  Congress  sought  to  solve  problems  created  by  900  service  advertising,  it  specifically  assigned  that  duty  to  the 
 FTC,  while  assigning  carrier  regulation  to  the  FCC.  11  Why?  Because  Congress  understood  that  the  FTC  may  lack  authority  over  900  services’  advertising  under  the 
 “common  carrier”  exemption  yet  the  FTC  had  the  requisite  expertise  to  address  advertising  abuses.  In  doing  so,  Congress  gave  the  FCC  distinct  regulatory  responsibilities  over  pay-per- 
 call  services,  but  not  for  these  services’  advertising.  If  the  FCC  had  authority  over  “advertising,”  it  does  not  appear  as  if  Congress  knew  about  it.  In  my  view,  similar  explicit 
 Congressional  action  would  be  required  before  we  should  enter  the  advertising  regulation  arena. 


 A  Zero  Sum  Game 
 The  drafting  of  this  Statement  has  already  consumed  substantial  resources.  Interpreting  and  implementing  it  and  its  potential  progeny  will  demand  significant  additional  energy. 
 Moreover,  the  agency’s  lack  of  expertise  and  the  wide  array  of  entities  who  advertise  or  market  these  services  further  exacerbate  these  resource  demands. 


 Inherent  in  the  resources  this  initiative  may  consume  is  the  majority’s  implicit  decision  to  move  resources  away  from  other  activities  in  order  to  regulate  advertising.  Our  budget  is  a 
 zero  sum  game.  Resources  for  advertising  regulation  are  resources  taken  away  from  other  Commission  activities.  In  a  period  of  hiring  freezes  and  travel  moratoria,  I  cannot  support 
 the  diversion  of  resources  to  advertising  supervision.  We  have  explicit,  and  in  many  cases  exclusive,  authority  over  a  number  of  consumer  protection  initiatives,  including  interstate 
 obscene  and  harassing  phone  calls  (§  223),  unsolicited  interstate  fax  advertisements  (§  227),  slamming  (§  258)  and  radio  interference  (§  302).  Unlike  the  advertising  issues  addressed  in 
 the  Statement,  states  are  generally  not  in  a  position  to  address  these  consumer  concerns.  In  my  view,  and  apart  from  my  legal  concerns,  our  resources  would  be  better  deployed  in  areas 
 where  the  FCC  has  clear  (and  often  sole)  jurisdiction  to  protect  consumers.  Too  often  we  do  not  have  the  resources  to  promptly  and  comprehensively  address  consumer  concerns  in  these 
 core  jurisdictional  areas.  I  believe  our  job  is  to  fully  and  completely  do  the  “good”  Congress  charged  us  with  under  the  statute  long  before  we  turn  our  attention  to  issues 
 outside  of  our  clear  authority. 


 Regardless  of  the  precision  or  persuasiveness  of  my  legal  and  policy  views,  there  will  be  those  who  ask:  “How  could  you  be  against  the  FCC’s  protection  of  consumers  from 
 fraudulent  advertising?”  My  answer  is  also  a  question:  “How  could  you  be  against  the  FCC  fully  staffing  and  funding  our  primary  and  explicit  statutory  responsibilities?” 


 11  See  15  U.  S.  C.  §  5711-  5724.  Congress  also  passed  Section  228  of  the  Communications  Act  to  give  the  FCC 
 additional  tools  to  combat  900  services’  abuses.
