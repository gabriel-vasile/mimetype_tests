        <p><strong>SUBJECT: </strong>Agreement with <u>United States Pharmacopeial Convention,  Inc.</u> Regarding Review of  Revisions to Compendial Requirements for Drugs (FDA-225-83-3000)</p>
        <p>I. PURPOSE</p>
        <p>This agreement defines the working arrangements  between the United States Pharmacopeial Convention, Inc. (USPC), and the Food  and Drug Administration (FDA) in regard to the review of revisions to  compendial requirements for drugs.</p>
        <p>II. BACKGROUND</p>
        <p>USPC is the publisher of the <u>United States  Pharmacopeia</u> and the <u>National Formulary.</u>  These texts and their supplements are  designated by 21 U.S.C. 321 as official compendia.  Official compendial requirements are  recognized in various adulteration and misbranding provisions of the Federal  Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, such as 21 U.S.C. 351(b).  FDA proposed a regulation (21 CFR 314.70) in  the FEDERAL REGISTER of October 19, 1982 (45 FR 46622) that would  allow applicants of approved drug applications to submit changes in the  conditions of their annual report to FDA if such changes were implemented to  comply with an official compendial requirement.</p>
        <p>It is a goal of both parties to ensure the  availability on the market of uniform and high quality drugs and drug products.</p>
        <p>III. SUBSTANCE OF AGREEMENT</p>
        <p class="indent1">A. An FDA-USPC Technical  Committee on Human Drug Quality (the Committee) will be formed. The Committee will be composed of four  members of the staff of USPC and four members of the staff of FDA as designated  by each party to this agreement.</p>
        <p class="indent1">B. The Committee will be  concerned with the review of standards, specifications, and methods of analysis  for human drugs. Articles classified as biologicals, medical devices, or  antibiotics are not ordinarily within the purview of the Committee.</p>
        <p class="indent1">C. The Committee may review and  discuss matters or topics of general or specific interest related to human drug  quality. By majority of the members  voting, the Committee may make recommendations concerning technical matters to USPC. These recommendations may be either general  or specific in nature. Members of the committee  act as individual scientists and do not have authority to act on behalf of FDA  or USPC.</p>
        <p class="indent1">D. Committee members may  recommend that the Committee review any revision proposals that have been  published in the <u>Pharmacopeial Forum,</u> that are consistent with Section  III (B) of this agreement.</p>
        <p class="indent1">E. If information of a trade  secret or of a confidential nature is provided to FDA members of the Committee  by USPC Members, FDA will treat the information in accordance with its freedom  of information procedures. FDA members  of the Committee may divulge to USPC members only information which is  otherwise available to the public under the Freedom of Information Act and FDA  regulations.</p>
        <p class="indent1">F. After discussion and review  of the data (i.e., data provided by USPC and material made available from FDA)  involving a matter before the Committee under paragraph D, the following  procedures shall be followed.</p>
        <p class="indent2">1. Should the revision proposal  be deemed adequate, no further action will be indicated.</p>
        <p class="indent2">2. Should the revision proposal  be deemed inadequate by the Committee, it may recommend that USPC request its  Revision Committee to obtain additional information to support the proposal  prior to its adoption. Such request  shall specify, insofar as practical, the type and nature of the data to be  obtained.</p>
        <p class="indent1">G. Minutes of meetings held by  the Committee will be maintained with copies being provided to liaison officers  in FDA and USPC. Copies of these minutes  will be publicly available.</p>
        <p class="indent1">H. If policy issues develop in  the course of the business of the Committee that are beyond the scope of this  Working Agreement, the Committee will promptly refer these issues to the  appropriate officials in FDA or USPC of resolution.</p>
