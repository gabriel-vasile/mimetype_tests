<h2 class="aligncenter debug">General Comment</h2>
<p class="alignleft debug">Dear Sir/Madam: <br>
<br>The United States Pharmacopeial Convention (USP) thanks the US Food and <br>Drug Administration (FDA) for the opportunity to comment on the FDA’s draft <br>Guidance for Industry: Voluntary Third-Party Certification Programs for Foods and <br>Feeds [Note 1].<br>
<br>We are supportive of this effort, and pleased that the draft guidance implicitly <br>recognizes the role and importance of standards and other safeguards in helping <br>to ensure safe imports.  We believe that third-party certification programs, along <br>with Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) and other measures, could play an <br>important role in promoting food security and safety.  <br>
<br>We note that the draft guidance mirrors in some key respects the verification <br>programs developed and launched by USP for dietary supplements, dietary <br>supplement ingredients, drug substances, and excipients [Note 2].  Many <br>elements of USP’s current verification programs -- GMP audit, document review, <br>testing for conformity assessments, certification, surveillance testing, and <br>decertification --- are attributes of third party certification programs sought by the <br>FDA in the draft guidance.  Thus, USP’s programs may serve as helpful examples <br>to the FDA in its efforts to encourage certification efforts in the area of foods and <br>feeds.  <br> <br>In USP’s programs, GMP audits play an important role, since quality cannot be <br>assured solely by testing. For example, in USP’s programs, inspection reports <br>identify major and minor deficiencies noted in the manufacturing process and until <br>corrective actions for major deficiencies are implemented, certification letters are <br>withheld.   One of the important requirements of these programs relates to change <br>control, and mandates that USP be notified of all major and moderate changes (as <br>defined in USP manuals), prior to implementation. This helps ensure consistency <br>in the quality and safety of the products/ingredients certified.  <br>
<br>We also strongly believe in the role and importance of public standards in <br>advancing verification programs and other food protection efforts.  Measures of <br>quality, purity, and identity for preservatives, antioxidants, colors, and other <br>substances used as components of food can provide an established standard to <br>which to verify and test food and food ingredients, making available to all- industry, <br>consumers, and government – an accepted measure, thereby creating public <br>confidence in products and their ingredients, and promoting the movement of such <br>goods in international commerce.  <br>
<br>Public standards are established to protect the public health, thwarting intentional <br>adulteration and counterfeiting, by allowing rapid updating of monographs to <br>address new threats.  This was recently demonstrated with the recent USP-FDA <br>cooperation on heparin and glycerin monographs, and is potentially equally as <br>valuable in the area of foods and feeds.  We would therefore be appreciative of an <br>opportunity to work with FDA to augment standards-setting efforts in the foods <br>area.<br>
<br>While USP is best known for setting quality standards for drugs, drug products, <br>dietary supplements, excipients and biologicals in the USP-NF, it also now sets <br>standards for food ingredients, using the same open and participatory science-<br>based processes used to establish its drug standards. The food ingredient <br>standards are published in the Food Chemicals Codex (FCC), which USP recently <br>acquired from the Institute of Medicine (IOM) and has since updated and <br>republished in its 6th edition.   <br>
<br>At present, a limited number of FCC standards are incorporated into specific FDA <br>regulations approving particular food additives, but unlike the drug standards in the <br>USP-NF, FCC food ingredient standards do not have broad legal recognition in the <br>United States.  Although the Secretary has the current authority under the Food, <br>Drug, and Cosmetic Act to set food ingredient standards, and does so as <br>evidenced in 21 CFR Parts 172-189, many of the established food ingredient <br>criteria are now outdated or lacking in the necessary detail to provide adequate <br>guidance to the food industry or confidence in the consumer.  We would therefore <br>request that FDA work to find ways to update and enhance recognition of <br>standards in this area, and as noted, we think that would also benefit certification <br>programs.<br>
<br>We thank FDA again for the opportunity to comment.  We would be very pleased <br>to share with you our experiences and expertise in developing and conducting <br>verification programs during the past seven years, our more recent experience with <br>FCC, and our related expertise and partnership with FDA in advancing public <br>standards over the last century, and to discuss how this knowledge might be <br>helpful in developing verification programs for foods and feeds.<br>
<br>Sincerely,<br>
<br>The United States Pharmacopeial Convention <br>

<br>Notes:<br>
<br>[1] http://www.fda.gov/oc/guidance/thirdpartycert.html.<br>[2] See http://www.usp.org/USPVerified/.  USP verification programs relating to <br>drug substances, excipients, and dietary ingredients are global in nature, and <br>manufacturers from China, India, Canada, Argentina, Peru, and other countries are <br>taking part in these programs.   FDA’s draft guidance notes that "recommendation <br>2 of the [President's] Action Plan is to 'verify compliance of foreign producers with <br>U.S. safety and security standards through certification,'" and that the Food <br>Protection Plan "emphasizes certification as a way to help verify the safety of <br>[food] products." (See, page 4). Additionally the draft guidance provides <br>that "inspectors should determine if an establishment has an effective, <br>documented program to verify product safety using scientifically sound methods." <br>(See, page 12).  <br>
