International Conference on Harmonisation; Guidance on Q4B

ACTION: Notice.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing the 
availability of a guidance entitled ``Q4B Evaluation and Recommendation 
of Pharmacopoeial Texts for Use in the ICH Regions.'' The guidance was 
prepared under the auspices of the International Conference on 
Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of 
Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH). The guidance describes a process 
for the evaluation and recommendation by the ICH Q4B Expert Working 
Group (EWG) of selected pharmacopeial texts to facilitate their 
recognition by regulatory authorities for use as interchangeable in the 
ICH regions. Following favorable evaluations, ICH will issue topic-
specific annexes with information about these texts and their 
implementation (the Q4B Outcomes). Implementation of the Q4B annexes is 
intended to avoid redundant testing by industry in favor of a common 
testing strategy in each ICH regulatory region.

DATES: Submit written or electronic comments on agency guidances at any 
time.

ADDRESSES: Submit written requests for single copies of this guidance 
to the Division of Drug Information (HFD-240), Center for Drug 
Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers 
Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, or the Office of Communication, Training and 
Manufacturers Assistance (HFM-40), Center for Biologics Evaluation and 
Research (CBER), Food and Drug Administration, 1401 Rockville Pike, 
Rockville, MD 20852-1448. The guidance may also be obtained by mail by 
calling CBER at 1-800-835-4709 or 301-827-1800. Send two self-addressed 
adhesive labels to assist the office in processing your requests. 
Submit written comments on the guidance to the Division of Dockets 
Management (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, 5630 Fishers Lane, 
rm. 1061, Rockville, MD 20852. Submit electronic comments to <A HREF="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&log=linklog&to=http://www.regulations.gov">http://www.regulations.gov</A>.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background

    FDA is announcing the availability of a guidance entitled ``Q4B 
Evaluation and Recommendation of Pharmacopoeial Texts for Use in the 
ICH Regions.'' In recent years, many important initiatives have been 
undertaken by regulatory authorities and industry associations to 
promote international harmonization of regulatory requirements. FDA has 
participated in many meetings designed to enhance harmonization and is 
committed to seeking scientifically based harmonized technical 
procedures for pharmaceutical development. One of the goals of 
harmonization is to identify and then reduce differences in technical 
requirements for drug development among regulatory agencies.
    ICH was organized to provide an opportunity for tripartite 
harmonization initiatives to be developed with input from both 
regulatory and industry representatives. FDA also seeks input from 
consumer representatives and others. ICH is concerned with 
harmonization of technical requirements for the registration of 
pharmaceutical products among three regions: The European Union, Japan,

[[Page 9576]]

and the United States. The six ICH sponsors are the European 
Commission, the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries 
Associations, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare, the 
Japanese Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, the Centers for Drug 
Evaluation and Research and Biologics Evaluation and Research, FDA, and 
the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America. The ICH 
Secretariat, which coordinates the preparation of documentation, is 
provided by the International Federation of Pharmaceutical 
Manufacturers Associations (IFPMA).
    The ICH Steering Committee includes representatives from each of 
the ICH sponsors and the IFPMA, as well as observers from the World 
Health Organization, Health Canada, and the European Free Trade Area.
    In the Federal Register of August 8, 2006 (71 FR 45059), FDA 
published a notice announcing the availability of a draft guidance 
entitled ``Q4B Regulatory Acceptance of Analytical Procedures and/or 
Acceptance Criteria.'' The notice gave interested persons an 
opportunity to submit comments by October 10, 2006.
    After consideration of the comments received and revisions to the 
guidance, a final draft guidance entitled ``Q4B Evaluation and 
Recommendation of Pharmacopoeial Texts for Use in the ICH Regions'' was 
submitted to the ICH Steering Committee and endorsed by the three 
participating regulatory agencies in November 2007.
    The guidance provides information on a Q4B process for evaluating 
harmonization proposals for specific pharmacopeial topics originating 
from the three-party Pharmacopoeial Discussion Group (PDG) or from 
individual PDG pharmacopeias. The PDG consists of representatives from 
the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines in the Council of 
Europe; the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, and the 
United States Pharmacopeial Convention, Inc. The results of the 
individual Q4B evaluations will move forward as topic-specific annexes 
to the core Q4B guidance. Each annex will be issued separately 
following the ICH step process, providing guidance to assist industry 
and regulators in the implementation of the specific topic evaluated by 
the ICH Q4B process. Following the receipt of comments on the draft 
guidance, the Q4B EWG made no substantive changes to the Q4B process or 
the use of annexes to convey the results of Q4B evaluations. The title 
of the guidance, as well as some of the text, was revised to more 
closely reflect the actual workings and process of the Q4B EWG.
    This guidance is being issued consistent with FDA's good guidance 
practices regulation (21 CFR 10.115). The guidance represents the 
agency's current thinking on Q4B evaluation and recommendation of 
pharmacopoeial texts for use in the ICH regions. It does not create or 
confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA 
or the public. An alternative approach may be used if such approach 
satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations.
