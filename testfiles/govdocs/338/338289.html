<p>Recently, a member of the governing board of the American
Public Health Association (APHA) spoke to a graduate seminar in
pharmacy administration about the activities of the APHA. &quot;How
many pharmacists are members?&quot; queried one of the students.
About 120 (0.4 percent) of a total membership of 30,000 was the
response. Following the seminar, the questioner wondered aloud
why so few pharmacists belonged. &quot;Well,&quot; said another
student, &quot;There aren&#146;t any public health pharmacists
are there?&quot;</p>

<p>Of course the student was right; there is no group of persons
known as public health pharmacists as there are public health
physicians and public health nurses, who with PhDs form the bulk
of membership in the APHA. Nevertheless, there may be pharmacists
engaged in public health activities who, for one reason or
another, have not joined the APHA, or who perhaps do not
recognize they are doing public health. Moreover, it may be
reasonable to shrug one&#146;s shoulders and say. &quot;So what?
Who needs public health pharmacists anyway?&quot; </p>

<p>It will be argued here that some, but not nearly enough,
pharmacists are now engaged in public health activities.
Furthermore, both the public and the profession of pharmacy
benefit from public health pharmacists, but pharmacy education
has failed to recognize the potential for pharmacists in public
health as well as to acquaint pharmacy students and practitioners
with role models in public health.</p>

<p>As defined in 1976 by a Milbank Memorial Fund Commission on
Higher Education for Public Health, &quot;Public Health is the
effort organized by society to protect, promote, and restore the
people&#146;s health. The programs, services, and institutions
involved emphasize the prevention of disease and the health needs
of the population as a whole.&quot;(l) </p>

<p>Thus, the scope of public health is wide. Those who provide a
preventive health service on the basis of a demonstrated need in
a population group are &quot;doing&quot; public health, as are
individuals involved in health-care planning and policy, and
those who evaluate programs. However, the common threads are
organized and collective. Public health problems are not health
problems considered as they occur in a series of individuals
presenting themselves to a health-care provider, but are
considered in the context of a community as a whole. Public
health professionals answer questions like: &quot;How frequently
does this illness occur, and to whom? How important is it
relative to other health problems? What can the community do to
prevent it?&quot; </p>

<p>One way to look at public health functions is by
stratification. At the micro level, the service is relatively
direct as compared to the macro or planning level. For example,
the director of a venereal disease clinic is functioning at the
micro level, whereas the individual who perceived the need in the
population compared to other needs, determined that there should
be such a clinic, and allocated resources for it, is functioning
at the macro level. Viewed in terms of these levels, the public
health role for particular categories of health professionals can
be seen from two perspectives: (i) at the micro level. From the
perspective of a health professional whose primary role is not in
public health, but who is performing some public health function,
And (ii) at the macro level, from the perspective of a health
professional whose primary role is in public health.</p>

<p>Traditionally, medical education has been disease-oriented,
turning only in recent years to patient-orientation. The parallel
situation in pharmacy has been an historic drug orientation with
recent emphasis on patient and interprofessional relationships.
Usually, health professionals study basic sciences and then learn
by &quot;practicing&quot; those skills believed necessary to
perform their future roles under the guidance of role models. For
pharmacy students, this traditionally has meant learning about
the drug, its source, formulation, and activity, as well as how
to translate a doctor&#146;s order into a therapeutic product.
When pharmacy students &quot;practiced,&quot; there was not
necessarily any interaction between the pharmacy student and
patients or customers, or between the pharmacy student and other
health professionals. Role models were often restricted to
nonpracticing faculty members until the student&#146;s
apprenticeship. As pharmacy education became more patient-oriented,
students began to &quot;practice&quot; in clinical settings, and
while they were still under the wing of a school of pharmacy,
their role models began to include community and hospital
pharmacists. In this respect, pharmaceutical education began to
resemble that of medicine, nursing, and dentistry, i.e. health
professional students interacting with patients under the
guidance of practitioners. However, medicine and nursing
educators long ago recognized that the health education model,
whether disease- or patient-oriented, failed in terms of teaching
public health, because of its inherent inability to take a
population perspective. Their solution, of course, resulted in
the special schools and departments which now teach public health
and train public health professionals. </p>

<p>The establishment of the first school of public health at The
John Hopkins University over 60 years ago was a turning point in
public health education. The school introduced specialization and
emphasized research and training in the science of hygiene and
public health as well as its application( 1). </p>

<p>Today, there are 20 schools of public health, and almost every
medical school has a department of community medicine that
incorporates the teaching of public health concepts. These
schools and departments neither produce nor employ one
predominant type of health professional, as contrasted with
schools of medicine, law, dentistry, nursing, and pharmacy.
Instead, professional functions are performed by persons from a
variety of backgrounds who adapt their knowledge and skills to
the field, and those such as biostatisticians, epidemiologists,
environmental specialists, nutritionists and health educators,
whose primary training is focused on public health problems.
Moreover, education must address not only the professional but
the executive functions that comprise public health. Executive
functions (meaning managing, policy making, and planning) are
performed by those with broad education and experience in public
health, who have acquired expertise in developing policy, setting
priorities, allocating resources, and organizing administrative
structure. </p>

<p>In addition, providing role models outside of the schools of
public health and departments of community medicine has always
been problematic. Solutions vary from simple role description to
externships. For example, at the Georgetown University School of
Medicine, the Department of Community and Family Medicine provide
summer externships in the Indian Health Service, rotations
through community-based clinics (mental health, venereal disease,
alcohol and drug abuse, and family planning), an elective in the
Montgomery County Maryland Public Health Department, and
biostatistics and epidemiology research experience in federal
agencies, in addition to lectures from professionals working in
the public health field. These persons, more than others, are
involved in the formulation of health- care policy, health-care
planning, and program implementation, direction, and evaluation,
especially at the national level. These persons then, more than
others, affect the practice arrangements of other health
professionals, as well as the equity, quality of, and access to
health services by the population. They work at the macro level.</p>

<p>To date, it is primarily the macro level sort of public health
professional that has been ignored by pharmacy education in its
half-hearted attempt to expose students to public health.
Moreover, the practicing pharmacist who is involved in public
health activities is so rare that (despite lip service given in
classes and professional journals about the pharmacist&#146;s
involvement in counseling, family planning, drug abuse, venereal
disease, etc.) relatively few pharmacists are available as role
models. </p>

<p>It must be remembered that role models have a strong influence
on the style and choice of professional practice. To social
analysts like Parsons and Merton, a role is a set of expectations
held toward the occupant of a particular position in a social
system(2,3). For purposes here, the concept of the role-set,
which recognizes that individuals may occupy a number of roles,
is the most pertinent, especially since roles may be ordered with
some more dominant than others (4). For example, instead of
considering public health activities as part of a community
pharmacist&#146;s role (i.e., as fulfilling his or her and other&#146;s
expectations regarding pharmacist&#146;s activities), public
health activities may be considered as a role among a community
pharmacist&#146;s set of roles. And this contributes in part to
the problem that an individual might fail to perform any public
health functions, and still be recognized as a pharmacist. It is
easy to justify one&#146;s existence with the inclusion of that
one role in a set of roles. This situation could not exist for
those whose occupation is public health, but who also happen to
be pharmacists.</p>

<p>PHARMACY PUBLIC HEALTH EDUCATION</p>

<p>As reviewed by Gibson (5), following its mention in the fourth
edition of <i>The Pharmaceutical Syllabus</i> in 1932, public
health received &quot;rather scant attention by pharmaceutical
education, if we are to assess the attention of the articles
appearing in the <i>American Journal of Pharmaceutical Education.</i>&quot;
A seminar was held in 1965 to discuss the public health curricula
in colleges of pharmacy (6), following the APhA&#146;s
publication of a study of the feasibility of using pharmacies as
distributors of health literature(7). Until 1972, no study had
assessed whether pharmaceutical education prepared pharmacists to
do what so many said they should do. In that year, Gibson
undertook a survey of public health instruction in colleges of
pharmacy and tested graduating seniors in 67 participating
colleges (5). The implications derived from that survey were that
pharmacy education suffered from: (i) the lack of a definition of
public health in pharmacy (or pharmacy in public health), (ii)
the lack of perceived relevance to pharmacy students, (iii) the
lack of a textbook focusing on the role of pharmacy in public
health, (iv) the lack of pharmacy faculty educated in and with
appropriate experience to teach public health, and (v) the lack
of sites where students could become involved with public health
projects, and work, with public health personnel. </p>

<p>There is little reason to believe that Gibson&#146;s articles
revolutionized public health education in pharmacy. There are few
courses devoted solely to public health pharmacy despite the fact
that the American Council on Pharmaceutical Education
accreditation guidelines provide a fertile base on which to build
courses in pharmacy public health. ACPE&#146;s accreditation
standards include: </p>

<p>&quot;Professional Studies and Training. Include a variety of
professional courses and experiences which may be represented in
the following manner: </p>

<dir>
    <li><dir>
            <li>(1) Pharmaceutical Sciences, e.g., pharmacognosy,
                pharmacology, medicinal/pharmaceutical,
                chemistry, pharmaceutics, and pharmacy
                administration.<p>(2) <i>Biomedical Sciences</i>,
                e.g., <i>pathology, pathophysiology, physical
                diagnosis, parasitology, epidemiology,
                biostatistics, and clinical pharmacology</i>.</p>
                <p>(3) <i>Social and Behavioral Sciences</i>, e.g.,
                medical sociology and health-care economics.</p>
                <p>(4) <i>Clinical Sciences and Practice (Clinical
                Component)</i></p>
                <p>(a) Clinically applied courses in pharmacy
                practice based on the pharmaceutical and
                biomedical sciences.</p>
                <p>(b) Clinical Clerkship and Externship, e.g.,
                supervised training in appropriate inpatient and
                outpatient environments, which provides for
                interdisciplinary experiences with other health
                professionals and includes distributive aspects
                of pharmacy practice in institutional and
                community pharmacy settings.</p>
                <p>(5) <i>Management of Pharmaceutical Services
                such as pharmacy practice, health-care delivery
                systems, and drug-utilization review and control.
                &quot;(8) Emphasis added.</i></p>
            </li>
        </dir>
    </li>
</dir>

<p>Although &quot;bits and pieces&quot; of the elements required
for training in pharmacy public health are present in most
curricula, they are not recognized or presented as such. Just as
the role of public health pharmacy gets lost in a set of roles,
training in public health pharmacy gets lost in the traditional
elements of the pharmacy curriculum. </p>

<p>There still is no textbook emphasizing the role of pharmacy in
public health, and nonpharmacy public health instructors are not
familiar enough with pharmacy to provide relevant courses or
Practiced experiences. Unfortunately the 1978 Report of the <i>Committee
for Establishing Standards for Undergraduate Education in
Pharmacy Administration</i> of the American Association of
Colleges of Pharmacy did not include a subcommittee report on
public health, although, &quot;bits and pieces&quot; are present
throughout the Subcommitee Report on the Social and Behavioral
Sciences(9). </p>

<p>PHARMACISTS DOING PUBLIC HEALTH</p>

<p>As previously outlined, there are two levels of public health
activities and, although pharmacists are involved at both levels,
little or no attention has been devoted to preparing pharmacists
to work at the macro level. </p>

<p>There is no doubt that pharmacists can and should perform
micro public health activities, despite the lack of direct
financial incentives. In most instances these activities are on
an individual pharmacist-to- patient basis. At this level,
pharmacists hand out literature and counsel patients about such
public health matters as smoking, alcohol and drug abuse,
poisoning, venereal disease, hypertension, cancer danger signals,
nutrition, and mental health. Some pharmacists are involved in
organized community public health programs which include
educating the public about and screening for hypertension,
diabetes, and cancer (l0). Others speak to school children about
drug abuse (11). Although many have written about new roles for
pharmacists such as monitoring drug compliance, drug
surveillance, drug utilization review, advising the consumer
about OTC agents, triage, and serving as physician surrogates and
members of health teams (l2-15), these also tend to be roles
performed at the micro level, and in some instances an activities
which one might have supposed were not new roles, but activities
the public had a right to expect of its pharmacists. More
recently, Kilwein has written about &quot;The Pharmacist and
Public Health,&quot; commenting that more pharmacy graduates
should pursue further education in schools of public health, and
that pharmacists are important community resource parsons on drug-related
matters (16). Burton and Smith have noted that pharmacists can
provide a community service by explaining the benefits their
customers are entitled to under federal, state, and local
legislation (17). Not only can pharmacists explain the benefits,
but they could tell people where they can apply for benefits and
social services. Thus, pharmacists are not lacking for public
health activities to perform, or people to tell them what they
should be doing. </p>

<p>Despite the lack of role models or a pharmacy education
specifically preparing them to do so, a number of pharmacists
hold positions at the macro level of public health. Some, but not
all, have obtained further degrees in public health, most
especially the MPH. The individuals are found at such federal
agencies as the Food and Drug Administration, the National Center
for Health Services Research, the Health Care Financing
Administration, Social Security Administration, Veterans
Administration, US Public Health Service, Office of Technology
Assessment, Bureau of Health Manpower, and the Federal Trade
Commission. Other pharmacists are employed at the state level,
most especially in Medicaid programs. Still others, have
positions in the private sector, some doing research and
evaluation, and others working as administrators, particularly in
third-party payment programs. What these persons have in common
is that their perspective is that of the population as a whole
group (or collection of groups) rather than that of the
individual patient. As pharmacists working at the macro level ;
they perform the following: (i) identify health-related community
problems; (ii) set health priorities; (iii) formulate policy and
make decisions; (iv) perform management and administrative
functions; (v) educate the community to recognize, and cooperate
in serving, its health needs; (vi) advise, consult, and support
community service programs, and (vii) perform research and/or
evaluate activities in public health. </p>

<p>NEED FOR PUBLIC HEALTH PHARMACISTS</p>

<p>The lack of attention to the need for pharmacists at the macro
level of the health-care system has affected the micro level as
well. It is the macro level public health pharmacist who can
address the problem of incentives for pharmacists to perform
micro level public health activities. Macro level public health
pharmacists who are knowledge-able about the training and
abilities of pharmacists (and who under-stand the health-care
system, interprofessional relationships and health economics) can
suggest system level changes that can provide direct and indirect
incentives (money and its substitutes) to pharmacists to perform
public health activities. </p>

<p>Before such incentives are developed it is necessary to
demonstrate that there is a need for pharmacists to perform these
activities. Public health pharmacists are also likely to be the
best persons to carry out such demonstrations and their
evaluations. Therefore, in addition to the public health
activities that are performed by any specialist at the macro
level, there is a special need for the public health pharmacist
to: (i) justify the need for pharmacists to have a public health
role; (ii) define the public health role for pharmacists; (iii)
teach and serve as role models in public health, (iv) evaluate
the performance of the pharmacist&#146;s public health role; (v)
design and help implement system level changes that provide
public health role incentives to pharmacists, and (vi)
disseminate information about new functions, program evaluations,
and the results of health services research, </p>

<p>What can pharmacy educators do to remedy the situation? First,
they should recognize that there are two levels where pharmacists
need to participate in public health, and that having,
pharmacists at the macro level may be critical to having them
perform public health activities at the micro level. Second,
develop competency-based curricula in public health. Third,
support publication of a text that addresses the pharmacist&#146;s
role in public health and the organization of health care.
Fourth, modernize public health courses, e.g., students need to
learn about Medicaid, HMOs formulas, etc., far more than they
need to learn about yellow fever epidemics and arthropod-borne
diseases. Fifth, provide exposure of students to adequate role
models, i.e., real-world pharmacists working at both levels in,
public health. Sixth, explore innovative programs to obtain these
goals, and share experiences; e.g., the Philadelphia College of
Pharmacy and Science has offered a course in which &quot;role
models&quot; are brought to the campus to discuss the
opportunities in their fields, and recently the Virginia
Commonwealth University School of Pharmacy has arranged an
externship for a student at a PSRO. Seventh, strongly encourage
an increase in the number of pharmacists who obtain the Masters
Degree in Public Health so they can: (i) act as role models at
the macro level and (ii) develop logical roles for public health
pharmacists at both the micro and macro levels.</p>

<p>Today, more than ever, there is a recognition that health
resources are scarce, that planning is essential, and that
traditional &quot;sickness&quot; services are limited in what
they can do. A health-care system must be a partnership between
the public and the health professional to increase the likelihood
that people will stay well and that, when ill, they will take
appropriate action in an appropriate system. The community
pharmacist, if only because of his or her location, has a public
health role in such a system. However, pharmacy will lose out if
it continues to take a parochial view. Pharmacy needs persons who
can take a population focus and maximize the chance that both the
people and pharmacy will benefit. We look to education to provide
the leadership for the future. </p>
