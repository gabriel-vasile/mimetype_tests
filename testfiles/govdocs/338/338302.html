<p></p>
<span class=heading3>Issued by</span><br>
<span class="regulartext">National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), (<a href="http://nccam.nih.gov/">http://nccam.nih.gov/</a>)
</span>
<p class="Heading3">I. Introduction </p>
<p class="regulartext">The purpose of this guidance is to provide direction to applicants on the implementation of the NCCAM Interim Policy - <a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-AT-05-003.html">NOT-AT-05-003</a>: Biologically Active Agents Used in Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) and Placebo Materials. This guidance is applicable to all Research Grants (R01, R15, R21), Fellowships (Fs), Career Awards (Ks), and Institutional Training Grants (T32, T35). It specifically addresses the product quality policies: </p>
<p class="regulartext">A. Investigators must provide evidence to convince NCCAM that the biologically active test agents and their placebos proposed for investigation are of sufficient quality. </p>
<p class="regulartext">B. Investigators must reserve test agent and placebo samples from each batch for verification at later dates of product quality, stability over time, and comparability from batch to batch. Before grant award, NCCAM will request that the applicant submit a plan for a sampling scheme, storing and analyzing samples, determining tolerable variances, and making the results of the analyses available to NCCAM. NCCAM may request access to the resulting records of these analyses and even aliquots of study materials for independent analyses. Special terms of award will be added to the Notice of Grant Award pursuant to 42 CFR 52.9 and 45 CFR 74.53. These terms require that the grantee be responsible for implementing the proposed and NCCAM-evaluated plan and submitting the requested information to NCCAM. Lack of compliance with the terms may be grounds for termination of the award. </p>
<p class="regulartext">For additional policies on scope of research and IND application, see NCCAM Policy - <a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-AT-05-003.html">NOT-AT-05-003</a>: Biologically Active Agents Used in Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) and Placebo Materials. </p>
<p class="Heading3">II. Contacting NCCAM </p>
<p class="regulartext">Investigators are strongly encouraged to contact a Program Officer who can answer questions about the policy or applicant guidance. Contact the appropriate Program Officer for your scientific area of research. The list of Program Officers can be found at <a href="http://nccam.nih.gov/research/contact/index.htm">http://nccam.nih.gov/research/contact/index.htm</a>.</p>
<p class="Heading3">III. Guidance to Applicants </p>
<p class="regulartext"><b>A. Information in Applications </b></p>
<p class="regulartext">Applicants should consider the cost of implementing NCCAM policy (including preparation of an IND application, if required by FDA) in the original application budget. </p>
<p class="regulartext">Although just-in-time information will be more comprehensive, sufficient product quality information must be included in the application to allow the reviewers to evaluate the significance, feasibility and scientific strength of the project. </p>
<p class="regulartext">The following information should be included in the Research Plan: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Name of the product (species, strain, as applicable); </li>
  <li> Parts to be used (e.g., root, stem, leaf) as applicable; </li>
  <li> Description of placebo or vehicle control group; </li>
  <li> Doses or concentrations to be used. </li>
</ul>
<p class="regulartext">In the Background and Significance section, provide the following: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Justification/rationale for studying the chosen product; </li>
  <li> Justification for the chosen form of the product (extract, powder, etc.); </li>
  <li> Justification for the proposed doses/concentrations; </li>
  <li> Description of the pharmacokinetics of the product (if known); </li>
  <li> Source of the product (and if not using a commercial source, an explanation of why a product generally available to the public is not being used). </li>
</ul>
<p class="regulartext"><b>B. Just-in-Time Information </b></p>
<p class="regulartext">After peer review, applicants with a better likelihood of being supported will be notified by NCCAM to submit product quality information. The information will be evaluated by a working group of the National Advisory Council for Complementary and Alternative Medicine. The working group will be convened by NCCAM after review but before a funding decision is made. Using the applicant guidance as evaluation criteria, the working group will determine if the information is satisfactory or unsatisfactory. Applicants submitting unsatisfactory information will not be funded. However, the applicant will have opportunities to submit additional information in response to a written request. (Applications are “alive” for 3 council cycles.) Applicants will be informed after the working group meeting about the evaluation outcome, funding decision, and opportunity to submit additional information, if necessary. </p>
<p class="Heading3">IV. Guidance on Just-in-Time Information </p>
<p class="regulartext">The following just-in-time information should be provided by the applicant upon NCCAM request. Guidance on five categories of products is provided: Botanicals (IV.
