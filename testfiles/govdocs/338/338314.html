<hr noshade color="#09589F">








    <p>The following discussion highlights objectives that met or  exceeded their 2010 targets; moved toward the targets, demonstrated no  change, or moved away from the targets; and those that lacked data to  assess progress.  Progress is illustrated in the Progress Quotient  bar chart (see Figure 17-1), which displays the percent of targeted change  achieved for objectives and subobjectives with sufficient data to assess  progress.</p>
      <p>Progress was made in the Medical Product Safety focus  area.  Two subobjectives met or exceeded  their targets (17-2a and c).  Two  subobjectives made progress toward their targets (17-1a and 17-2b).  One objective and one subobjective  showed no movement toward or away from their targets (17-6 and 17-5a), and  one subobjective moved away from its target (17-5b).  Trends could not be assessed for one objective and one  subobjective at the time of the midcourse review (17-4 and 17-2d).</p>
      <p><span class="textheader">Objectives  that met or exceeded their targets.</span>  Two subobjectives met  their 2010 targets.  The proportion  of providers in health care organizations using electronic medical records (17-2a)  increased from 12 percent in 2000 to 19 percent in 2004, surpassing its  target.  The proportion of general and  children's hospitals using computerized prescriber order entry (17-2c) increased  from 4 percent in 2001 to 6 percent in 2003, achieving the target.</p>
      <p>Achieving and moving beyond these targets involves the  entire health care system.  Practices  such as using electronic medical records and computerized prescriber order  entry, if adopted, can enhance the quality of care by reducing potential  errors.<sup><a href="FA17References.htm#1">1</a>, <a href="FA17References.htm#2">2</a></sup>    Information technology use in health care organizations is linked to  financial resources.  Accordingly,  influencing organizations to allocate resources to implement information  technology is a challenge.  Large  organizations, however, are beginning to implement electronic medical records  and computerized prescriber order entry systems.  For example, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs intends  to have all of its acute care facilities equipped with bar-coding  technology.  However, financial and other  incentives are probably needed to address smaller organizations, ambulatory  settings, and physician offices.</p>
      <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is encouraging  health care providers to adopt information technologies and is working with the  National Library of Medicine to establish a publicly accessible electronic  repository of current prescription drug labeling.  This repository can be used by decision support systems  throughout the health care community to inform prescribing decisions.  </p>
      <p>Other activities encompass collaboration among  organizations to establish standards for electronic recording, submission, and  dissemination of approved product labeling to improve use by providers and  patients.<sup><a href="FA17References.htm#1">1</a></sup>  In addition, standard vocabularies and  taxonomies to facilitate the seamless exchange of electronic data submissions between  different operating systems are being developed by FDA, the National Cancer  Institute, the U.S. Pharmacopeial Convention, and others.  These collaborations offer opportunities for  outside groups to contribute to developing the information technology standards  necessary for more universal data exchange.</p>
      <p><span class="textheader">Objectives  that moved toward their targets. </span>One objective and one subobjective moved toward their targets.  Pharmacists using electronic medical records  (17-2b) achieved 13 percent of the targeted change between 1999 and 2001 (see  earlier discussion).  The proportion of  health care organizations monitoring and analyzing adverse events associated with  their medical therapies (17-1a) increased between 1998 and 2003, achieving 25  percent of the targeted change. </p>
      <p>FDA's approval process includes a rigorous review of  science-based clinical trials to identify clinically important safety issues in  the population studied.  However, the  more rarely occurring safety issues may only become evident with wider  use.  To identify early signals of  patient harm, FDA relies on required reporting by product manufacturers and on  health care providers' voluntarily reporting suspected serious adverse  events.  To move the subobjective for monitoring and  analyzing adverse events (17-1a) toward its target, FDA, the Centers for  Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,  and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality are collaborating to broaden  the ability to capture adverse event and medication information.  Collaborations such as Connecting for Health<sup><a href="FA17References.htm#3">3</a></sup> have been founded to facilitate automated data collection by devising tools for  health information networks and by partnering to support development of health  information exchange between different localities.</p>
      <p>FDA also has programs to improve the safe use of regulated  products by facilitating reporting of serious adverse events related to the use  of these products to FDA.  MedWatch,<sup><a href="FA17References.htm#4">4</a></sup> FDA's Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting Program, is one such  program.  MedWatch also disseminates  updated drug safety information to inform providers of the most recent safety  information.  Furthermore, FDA's Medical  Device Safety Network (MedSun) program is intended to improve the safe use of  medical devices by the following actions:
      <ul>
      <li>Reducing barriers to reporting medical device-related  adverse events by device-user facilities (such as hospitals and outpatient clinics).
      <li>Training device-user facilities to recognize and report  adverse events.
      <li>Sharing information between device-user facilities  about the identification, understanding, and resolution of device problems.
      
</ul>
<p>Other opportunities for meeting the target include taking  advantage of adverse event recording and reporting systems that are linked  between organizations, including FDA.</p>
      <p>Preventing adverse events before they occur is the ideal  solution.  Accordingly, FDA is working  on several projects to help identify the potential for an adverse event before  it happens to a patient.  For example,  FDA continues to implement postmarketing risk management programs with active  surveillance and is furthering its efforts to reduce medication errors by  implementing a universal bar-coding system for prescription medicines and blood  products.</p>
      <p><span class="textheader">Objectives that demonstrated no  change.</span> One  objective and one subobjective remained static.  No change was noted for the receipt of oral counseling about medications from prescribers (17-5a).  Between 1998 and 2000, 24 percent of  patients received counseling about their new prescription medicines.</p>
      <p>National organizations are encouraging prescriber  counseling with consumer-focused campaigns.   Examples are the Partnership for Clear Health Communication's "Ask Me 3"<sup><a href="FA17References.htm#5">5</a></sup> and the National Council on Patient Information and Education's "Talk About  Prescriptions."<sup><a href="FA17References.htm#6">6</a></sup>  FDA participates in forums designed to  influence health care professionals' behavior and emphasize the importance of  counseling.  FDA has finalized changes  to prescription drug labeling for health care professionals.  These revisions are expected to facilitate  oral counseling by making clearer what information FDA and product  manufacturers believe patients should be told.  </p>
      <p>Blood donations (17-6) also showed no change relative to  the target.  Between 1998 and 2003, the  overall proportion of people in the United States who donated blood each year  remained static at 6 percent. </p>
      <p>Donor recruitment and retention are two major challenges  in meeting the target.  In the past,  recruitment has not fulfilled demands.   Blood and blood components have a limited shelf life and must be  continually replenished.  Further  transfusion-transmitted diseases and various exclusionary behaviors have  decreased the pool of eligible donors.
      <p>Through FDA, HHS is working to support industry efforts to  recruit and retain new blood donors.   The HHS Advisory Committee on Blood Safety and Availability works to  ensure an adequate blood supply.  FDA provides  guidance on donor incentives and participates in workshops<sup><a href="FA17References.htm#7">7</a>, <a href="FA17References.htm#8">8</a>, <a href="FA17References.htm#9">9</a></sup> on donor incentives, donor suitability, and best practices in donor  recruitment.  In addition, FDA has  actively worked with the blood community to improve the donation process by  developing improved, tested donor-screening materials and computer-assisted  donor interviews.</p>
      <p><span class="textheader">Objectives  that moved away from their targets.</span> One subobjective<em>, </em>receipt  of oral counseling about medications by pharmacists (17-5b), moved away from  its target.  In 2000, 12 percent of  patients received oral counseling about their prescription medicines from their  pharmacists, compared with 14 percent who received such counseling during  the baseline year of 1998.  </p>
      <p>Remaining challenges include the limited time and  incentives for pharmacists to counsel patients.  FDA has identified several opportunities for advancing this  subobjective.  These include  collaborating with CMS in its oversight role for the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation  Act of 1990 (OBRA 90), as well as working with State pharmacy boards to  encourage oral counseling.</p>
      <p><span class="textheader">Objectives  that could not be assessed.</span> As discussed previously, provider  review of medications taken by patients (17-3) was deleted due to lack of an  identifiable data source.  Receipt of  useful information about prescriptions (17-4) remained developmental.  Although FDA sponsored the collection of  national data in 2001 to measure the usefulness of written information about  prescription drugs, a single valid baseline measure could not be  established.  Furthermore, overall usefulness  varied depending on what medication information was being assessed.</p>
      <p>According to Public Law 104-180, FDA will not require the  distribution of written medication information uniform in content and format as  long as, by 2006, 95 percent of patients getting new prescriptions also get  useful written information about the dispensed medicine.  The specific requirements defining useful  written information are detailed in a long-range action plan agreed on by a consortium  of stakeholders and accepted by the Secretary of HHS.<sup><a href="FA17References.htm#10">10</a></sup>  FDA is working with various private-sector  stakeholders to meet this target, including recent guidance to the publishers  of medication information.<sup><a href="FA17References.htm#11">11</a></sup></p>
      <p>The use of computerized prescriber order entry by urban  acute care facilities (17-2d) became measurable on the basis of data  acquired from the Leapfrog Group.  The  baseline data from 2003 showed that 5 percent of urban acute care  facilities used computerized prescriber order entry.  The  second evaluation occurred in 2005, and data analysis is under way.</p>
