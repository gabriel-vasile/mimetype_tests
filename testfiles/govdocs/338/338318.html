<H1><I>Pseudomonas</I> Bloodstream Infections Associated with a 
Heparin/Saline Flush --- Missouri, New York, Texas, and Michigan, 2004--2005</FONT></H1>
</P><P>On January 26, 2005, CDC was notified of four cases of 

<I>Pseudomonas fluorescens</I> bloodstream infection among patients 
at an oncology clinic in Missouri. All patients had received a heparin/saline flush to prevent clotting of indwelling, central venous catheters. The flushes were preloaded in syringes by IV Flush and distributed by Pinnacle Medical Supply 
(Rowlett, Texas). On January 31, a nationwide alert against use of all heparin or saline flushes preloaded in syringes by IV Flush was issued by the Food and Drug Administration; the company recalled these products. As of February 15, state and local 
health departments and CDC had identified a total of 36 

<I>Psuedomonas</I> species infections in patients in four states who 
were administered the heparin/saline flushes from multiple lots. This report describes the ongoing investigation and provides recommendations for investigation and management of potential cases.
<H4>
<B>Missouri</B>
</H4>
</P><P>During December 29, 2004--February 1, 2005, a hospital physician diagnosed nine cases of 

<I>P. fluorescens </I>infection; eight were in patients at an oncology clinic, and one was in a 
patient hospitalized with sickle cell disease. Median age of the 
nine patients was 57 years (range: 32--72 years). Of the eight patients with cancer, three (38%) had received stem-cell transplants within 6 months of infection. All nine patients had long-term, indwelling, central venous catheters and had 
received heparin/saline flush prepared by IV Flush, usually in 10 mL syringes. Patients had either fever or fever and chills within 2--26 days after their catheters were flushed. Blood cultures drawn through the catheters grew 
<I>P. fluorescens</I>; simultaneous, peripheral blood cultures did not grow the 
organism. In one patient, a tissue sample from the area surrounding the catheter grew 
<I>P. fluorescens</I>. In addition, cultures of unopened heparin/saline syringes from IV Flush grew 
<I>P. fluorescens</I> in the laboratory of the hospital. Catheters were removed, and the patients were treated with intravenous 
and/or oral antibiotics; all patients recovered from their infections.
<H4>
<B>New York</B>
</H4>
</P><P>On February 4, 2005, a hospital notified the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene 
(NYCDOHMH) and the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) of six cases of 
<I>P. fluorescens</I> infections in children with 
central venous catheters. All six patients had received heparin/saline flush, preloaded in syringes by IV Flush. NYSDOH 
and NYCDOHMH immediately alerted providers and laboratories and asked them to perform surveillance for cases of 
bacteremia or sepsis with <I>P. fluorescens</I> and to submit isolates to their public health laboratories for confirmation and molecular typing. Surveillance of cases during December 13, 2004--February 8, 2005, resulted in identification of 12 cases 
of <I>P. fluorescens<B> </B></I>infections. All 12 patients were children; median age was 9 years (range: 8 months--18 years). All 12 had long-term, indwelling, central venous catheters and had been 

administered heparin/saline flush, preloaded in syringes by IV Flush. Blood cultures were obtained through the catheters in 10 patients (83%) and from peripheral sites in three patients (25%). 
Of the 12 patients, 10 (83%) had cancer, one had cystic fibrosis, and one had an X-linked immunodysregulatory disease. All the 

patients had fever, and three (25%) had 
hypotension. Nine (75%) were admitted to the hospital for treatment 

with intravenous antibiotics, and one required admission 
to the intensive care unit for management of 
hypotension; seven (58%) had recurring febrile episodes. All 12 patients were treated with antibiotics; six (50%) patients also required catheter 

removal. All 12 patients recovered. Cultures of unopened heparin/saline syringes from IV Flush grew <I>P. fluorescens</I> in the New York State Public Health Laboratory.
<H4>
<B>Texas</B>
</H4>
</P><P>During December 12, 2004--February 5, 2005, physicians diagnosed 14 
<I>Pseudomonas</I> species bloodstream infections (11 

<I>P. fluorescens</I> and three unknown 
<I>Pseudomonas</I> species) among patients in one hospital. The 14 patients had been 
admitted for various conditions, including seizure, colon cancer, pneumonia, urinary-tract infection, and sepsis. Median age of the patients was 50 years (range: 16 days--86 years). All patients had either short- or long-term, indwelling, central 
venous catheters and had received heparin/saline flush prepared by IV Flush. In all cases, the 

<I>Pseudomonas</I> species were recovered from peripheral blood cultures. All patients had fever during their hospital stays; all were treated with intravenous antibiotics, 
and peripherally inserted central catheters and central venous lines were removed. Thirteen (93%) of the patients recovered; one infant remained hospitalized as of March 22, but the continued hospitalization was not related to the infection. Cultures of unopened heparin/saline syringes from IV Flush grew 
<I>P. fluorescens</I> in the hospital laboratory. Pulsed-field gel 
electrophoresis (PFGE) testing at the Texas State Public Health Laboratory revealed that isolates from eight patients and an unopened heparin/saline syringe from IV Flush were indistinguishable by one enzyme.
<H4>
<B>Michigan</B>
</H4>
</P><P>In January 2005, a patient with a chronic, indwelling, central venous catheter had onset of chills and fever several 

hours after the catheter had been used during a surgical procedure. The patient had received a heparin/saline flush, prepared by IV Flush, at a local clinic during the preceding week. Blood cultures were obtained through the catheter and grew 
<I>P. fluorescens</I>. The patient was treated with antibiotics and 
recovered.
<H4>
<B>Investigation of IV Flush</B>
</H4>
</P><P>A trace-back investigation by state and local health departments and CDC determined that IV Flush was the source of 
the heparin/saline flush administered in preloaded syringes to all patients with 
<I>P. fluorescens </I>infections. To produce its 
heparin/saline flush, IV Flush ordered heparin powder and sent it to a compounding pharmacy, where a concentrated heparin solution was made. This concentrated solution was then 
returned to IV Flush, where it was added to bags of saline solution, 
from which the syringes were filled. Sterility testing of the concentrated heparin solution by IV Flush was reportedly not performed. After discovering that the heparin/saline flush was contaminated, the physician in Missouri informed IV Flush and 

the Missouri State Department of Health and Senior Services. The state health department notified CDC, which 
notified FDA, and IV Flush subsequently initiated a nationwide recall. On January 31, 2005, FDA issued an alert against use of the flush and subsequently issued an updated alert on February 4 
(<I>1</I>).
</P><P>Samples of unopened heparin/saline flush syringes were sent to CDC, where bacterial cultures of seven of nine lots 
grew <I>P. fluorescens.</I> CDC also plans to conduct PFGE tests on isolates from all four states; as of March 22, the only molecular typing results were from the Texas State Public Health Laboratory. Information obtained by FDA indicated that the 
heparin/saline flush might have been distributed to locations in as many as 17 states during the preceding year. CDC continues to work with state and local health departments and FDA to ensure that heparin/saline syringes from IV Flush are no longer in use in 

these locations and to search for additional cases.

<H3>Editorial Note:</H3>
</P><P> The findings from this ongoing investigation indicate that heparin/saline flush, preloaded in syringes by 
IV Flush, was contaminated with <I>P. 
fluorescens</I> during commercial preparation and administered to multiple patients in at 
least four states. Exposure to the contaminated flush has been associated with infections in 36 patients; additional potential cases are under investigation. Most of the patients had serious underlying medical conditions and subsequently had 
bloodstream infections; many required hospitalization and surgical removal of long-term, indwelling, catheters. CDC, FDA, and state and local health departments continue their efforts to ensure that the recalled syringes are no longer being used.

</P><P><I>P. fluorescens</I> is a member of the fluorescent pseudomonad bacteria group and is an infrequent cause of blood stream infections. Optimal temperature range for growing the 
organism is 

77<SUP>&#186;</SUP>F--86<SUP>&#186;</SUP>F 
(25<SUP>&#186;</SUP>C--30<SUP>&#186;</SUP>C); <I>P. 
fluorescens</I> can be difficult to grow when samples are incubated at 
98.6<SUP>&#186;</SUP>F (37<SUP>&#186;</SUP>C), the temperature at which most bacterial cultures are incubated in hospital microbiology laboratories (<I>2</I>). Depending on laboratory capabilities, identification of 

<I>P. fluorescens</I> can be difficult; therefore, patients who received the heparin/saline flush and were infected with unidentified <I>Pseudomonas</I> species were included in the case count in this report.
</P><P>FDA is investigating the source of contamination in this outbreak, which might have occurred either at IV Flush or at 

the compounding pharmacy that prepared the heparin solution. Preparation of drug products to fill prescriptions for specifically designated patients is considered pharmaceutical compounding, not manufacturing. However, companies that prepare products not requested by a prescription are considered manufacturers and should follow requirements set forth by FDA regulations on good manufacturing practices 
(<I>3</I>). These regulations help ensure the sterility of products intended for 

injection and include requirements for measures such as validation of sterilization techniques and sterility testing of finished products. In this case, sterility testing of the finished product was reportedly not performed. Had it been done, the contamination that led to this outbreak might have been detected 
before the product was distributed.
</P><P>Contaminated products prepared in compounding pharmacies have also been implicated in previous clusters of 
infections, including <I>Exophiala 
dermatiditis</I> joint infections caused by injectable steroids 
(<I><a href=mm5149a1.htm>4</a></I>); <I>Chryseomonas</I> and 

<I>Serratia</I> species infections, resulting in meningitis from epidural injections (CDC, unpublished data, 2002; Contra Costa Health Services, unpublished data, 2002); and <I>Burkholderia 
cepacia</I> blood stream infections from intravenous flush (CDC, unpublished data, 
2004). Regulatory oversight of compounding pharmacies varies among states. However, compounding pharmacies are subject 
to inspection by pharmacy boards, FDA, and accreditation 
organizations. The American Society of Health-System 
Pharmacists and the U.S. Pharmacopeia have developed guidance and standards that address quality assurance and sterile preparation 
of compounded products (<I>5,6</I>). In addition, in May 2004, the Pharmacy Compounding Accreditation Board (PCAB) 
established a task force to set standards for a voluntary accreditation board for compounding pharmacies 
(<I>7</I>).
</P><P>Companies that manufacture products intended for injection should follow FDA regulations for ensuring the sterility 
of these products (<I>3</I>). Health-care providers who detect cases of 
<I>Pseudomonas</I> species infection in patients with central 

venous catheters are urged to determine whether their patients received the heparin/saline flush recalled by IV Flush. Although the product has been recalled, cases have occurred up to 
1 month after receipt of the product. Indwelling, intravenous 
catheters that are used infrequently can become colonized with organisms in a biofilm, and symptoms might not develop until the catheter is used. Susceptibility patterns of organisms isolated from the 36 identified patients have varied, with multiple isolates resistant to third-generation cephalosporins and carbapenem antibiotics. Treatment for potential patients should include targeted antimicrobial therapy and consideration of removing their catheters 
(<I>8</I>). In addition, cases that might be related to 
use of this product should be reported to state and local health departments, CDC, and the FDA MedWatch program (<a href="http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/report.htm">http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/report.htm</a> or 1-800-FDA-1088, press 0).
