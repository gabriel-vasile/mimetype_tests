               updates are identified with an asterisk (*).*

TYPE OF ALERT: Intensified Coverage

               *(Note: This import alert contains guidance to FDA field
               personnel only.  It does not establish any requirements, or
               create any rights or obligations on FDA or on regulated

               claims, such as weight reduction, are made.

PAC:           82007

COUNTRY:       All

MANUFACTURER/
SHIPPER:       Various (see attachment)

CHARGE:        If appropriate, charge:

               Devices lacking prescription legend or otherwise not in
               compliance with 21 CFR 801.109:

               "The article is subject to refusal of admission pursuant to
               Section 801(a)(3) in that it appears to be a prescription
               device labeled for lay use, and thus lacks adequate
               directions for its use [Misbranded, 502(f)(1)]."

               Devices with inappropriate claims:

               "The article is subject to refusal of admission pursuant to
               section 801(a)(3) in that it appears to lack adequate
               directions for its intended use [Misbranded, 502(f)(1)]."

               Devices with labeling claims that are false and misleading:

               "The article is subject to refusal of admission pursuant to
               section 801(a)(3) in that its labeling appears to be false
               or misleading [Misbranded, 502(a)]."

               Devices marketed without premarket notification:

               "The article is subject to refusal of admission pursuant to
               Section 801(a)(3) in that it appears that a premarket
               notification was not submitted pursuant to section 510(k)
               [Misbranded, 502(o)]."

               Charges may be combined as appropriate.

               Note:  Depending on the actual electromechanical
               configuration of the device it may also be misbranded within
               the meaning of Section 502(f)(2).

RECOMMENDING
OFFICE:        CDRH and SAN-DO

REASON FOR
ALERT:         The use of these electrical devices in health clubs, beauty
               salons and figure salons has been increasing for several
               years.  While there are legitimate uses for both muscle
               stimulators and iontophoresis devices, they are prescription
               devices and are misbranded when labeled for lay use.  In
               addition, muscle stimulators are misbranded when any of the
               following claims are made:  girth reduction, loss of inches,
               weight reduction, cellulite removal, bust development, body
               shaping and contouring, and spot reducing.

               A large number of these products are imported with the list
               increasing (see attachments I and II).  The following
               information is provided to aid the districts in identifying
               and detaining misbranded muscle stimulators and
               iontophoresis devices.

               Muscle Stimulators:

               Electrical muscle stimulators are prescription devices used
               to repeatedly contract muscles by passing electrical
               currents through electrodes in contact with the body.  One
               or more pairs of electrodes, along with creams or gels, may
               accompany the device, which may be powered by battery or
               line voltage.  There are currently no acceptable uses for
               these devices when labeled for over-the-counter use.  When
               labeled for Rx use by a licensed practitioner, the following
               uses are generally recognized as acceptable:

               1.   Relaxation of muscle spasm.

               2.   Prevention or retardation of disuse atrophy.

               3.   Muscle reeducation.

               4.   Increasing local blood circulation.

               5.   Immediate postsurgical stimulation of calf muscles to
                    prevent venous thrombosis.

               6.   Maintaining or increasing range of motion.  The
                    labeling must contain the prescription legend and
                    comply with all the conditions of 21 CFR 801.109.

               Muscle stimulators are misbranded when any of the following
               claims are made:  girth reduction, loss of inches, weight
               reduction, cellulite removal, bust development, body shaping
               and contouring, and spot reducing.

               Iontophoresis Devices

               An iontophoresis device is a prescription device used to
               introduce ions of soluble salts (i.e., medications) by use
               of direct current into the tissues of the body for
               therapeutic or diagnostic purposes.

               There are currently no acceptable uses for iontophoresis
               devices when they are labeled for over-the-counter use.
               When labeled for Rx use by a licensed practitioner, the only
               approved use is the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis explained
               in the final classification 21 CFR Part 890.5525, * or for
               use with a drug, if labeling includes adequate directions
               for use of the device with that drug.*

               All other uses would result in the device being considered
               Class III, requiring premarket approval.

               The labeling for this device must contain the prescription
               legend and comply with all the required information of 21
               CFR 801.109.

               The names of these devices, the names of the companies and
               the labeling claims may change in the future.  Some devices
               are being promoted for both muscle stimulation and
               iontophoresis. There is no objection to combined labeling or
               use as long as the labeling requirements for both uses are
               met and FDA has determined it to be substantially equivalent
               to preamendment electrical muscle stimulators and
               iontophoresis devices.

GUIDANCE:      *Consult the Center for Devices and Radiological Health
               (HFZ-343), Edgardo Santiago at (301) 594-4659* about
               appropriate charges, adequate warnings, and whether
               detention is warranted.

               *For questions or issues concerning science, science policy,
               sample collection, analysis, preparation, or analytical
               methodology, contact the Division of Field Science at (301)
               443-3320 or 3007.*
