INTRODUCTION

     The Library of Congress collections include a very large and
growing number of books in microform. This guide is intended to
call your attention to a considerable research resource--in this
case, books in microform--and give you some suggestions and other
information to help you use it (See also Research Guide #16,
"Using Research Materials in Microform").

     Books in microform are added to the collections through
purchase, copyright, exchange, gift, and the Library's vast
preservation microfilming project. Many are single titles
microfilmed individually. The majority are titles that have been
microfilmed as items in discrete collections of varying sizes.
These books range widely in date and place of publication,
language, and subject matter. While a number of these books
duplicate titles in the Library's paper collection, many others
are available only in microform. This means that whether you are
looking for a book that LC owns, but which is not on the shelf,
or a book not owned by LC, it is a good idea to check and see if
LC owns a microfilmed copy of it.

     This guide primarily lists materials in the Microform
Reading Room (MicRR),which has custody of and services the
majority of books in microform, whether as single titles or as
items within a collection. Keep in mind, however, that research
materials in microform --including books in microform--are found
in several locations throughout the Library. The general rule is
that a microfilmed book is in the custody of and serviced by the
same section or reading room that would have custody and service
of the book if it were on paper. For example, a law book would go
to the Law Library regardless of the format; a book in Japanese
would go to the Asian Division regardless of the format, and so
forth. A few representative titles available at some of these
other locations have been listed. Although the finding tools and
research techniques are generally the same for finding books in
microform in these other locations, you should also consult the
reference librarians and special finding aids available there.




FINDING SINGLE TITLES: Practically all single titles in microform
can be found by doing standard searches in the Library's catalogs
(card, printed book, computer). You may have to search more than
one catalog. Since not all titles in microform receive full
cataloging, subject searches will miss some titles. Keyword
searches can be a good substitute. Some single titles filmed
before 1982 are listed only in the Microform Reading Room's card
catalog or only in the Main Card Catalog (this will be so for
some time to come).

FINDING TITLES IN COLLECTIONS: Using the same tools and
techniques suggested above for finding single titles will also
yield many titles that are part of collections. However, since
all microform collections have not yet been fully analyzed, many
other books in these collections are not listed in the Library's
catalogs. To find these books you first have to search for one or
more relevant microform collections that include books and then
use the guide to the collection's contents to see if your title
is listed. (In rare instances a collection does not have a guide
and it is necessary to browse the collection itself.)

FINDING RELEVANT COLLECTIONS: To identify one or more microform
collections that are likely to include the book(s) you need, you
may start by reviewing the collections listed in this guide. You
may then want to consult Microform Collections and Selected
Titles in the Microform Reading Room (3rd ed., "K-3"; and its
supplement, "K-4"; future editions);  look in the index under
"Books," appropriate subject headings, and/or browse the list of
titles. Copies are available on reference in the various reading

rooms. Since the previous two sources are not all inclusive, you
may also need to search the Library's computerized catalog.
Practically all microform collections are now listed there. If
you do not know the name of a relevant collection, doing title
keyword searches is a good strategy since collection titles tend
to be descriptive; adding "and t microform" to your search
statement will limit your search results to mostly microforms. It
is also useful to browse through the printed set of numbered or
cataloged guides to the collections in the Microform Reading
Room.  

LIST OF MICROFORM COLLECTIONS THAT CONTAIN BOOKS  

     This list is representative rather than exhaustive.  It
includes many of the largest and/or more frequently consulted
microform collections of this kind, as well as numerous other
collections whose size, subject, provenance, language, etc.,
illustrate the breadth and variety of these materials. Some of
the collections consist of books only, while others include a
variety of materials.

OF RELATED INTEREST:  

     The Microform Reading Room also includes in its collection a
number of microfilmed catalogs of other libraries, archives, and
universities. Practically all of these have been cataloged and
can be found through regular computer searches, e.g., by
searching under the name of the institution.  Be aware, however,
that some of these catalogs have been cataloged as monographs and
some as serials so you may need to check both of these computer
files.
