<H1><CENTER>DEVICE CENTER'S FY 98 PERFORMANCE</CENTER></h1><BR>

  
         <P>FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH)
premarket review program met all of its goals for fiscal year
1998 (FY 98), which covers the period of October 1, 1997 to
September 30, 1998. The Center, which does not receive any user
fees, continued to make improvements over previous years' review
of medical devices.</P>
         <P>During FY 98, CDRH maintained for the second year in a row a
"zero" backlog of premarket approval applications (PMAs) for
novel devices, PMA supplements, and 510(k)s, submissions for
products similar to others already marketed.</P>
         <P>CDRH approved 46 PMAs in FY 98, 11 of which represented
important diagnostic or therapeutic advances, and four were
Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) PMAs for so-called "orphan"
devices manufactured for the benefit of fewer than 4,000
patients.</P>
         <P>Management initiatives that had been tested in pilots were
implemented throughout the Center's premarket review program.
Communication with industry continued to improve, with more
companies taking advantage of the opportunities to consult with
FDA while planning clinical studies.</P>
         <P>These factors contributed to further reductions in the
Center's review times. The average time from submission to
approval for PMAs in FY 98 was 12.4 months, 25% less than the
average review time of 16.6 months in FY 97 and 50% less than the
average of 25.9 months in FY 96. The median total time to
approval in 1998 was just 8.7 months.</P>
        <P>This year CDRH had the shortest review time for any
substantial number of PMAs in a decade. Of the PMAs approved in
the past fiscal year, 33% (15 of 46) were approved in less than
180 days, and 63% (29 of 46) were approved in less than 1 year.
Furthermore, 28 of the 46 PMAs were never overdue in any review
cycle.</P>  
         <P>For 510(k) applications, the average total review time was
114 days, an improvement over the average 130 days in FY 97 and
145 days in FY 96. This translates to 59% of 510(k) reviews
completed within 90 days, compared to 58% in FY 97 and 50% in FY
96.</P> 
        <P> The median review time for 510(k)s cleared in FY 98 was 83
days. About 98 percent of medical devices marketed in the United
States are 510(k) products, which are similar to already existing
devices.</P>
         <P>In addition to the new devices cited in the FDA's Report on
New Health Care Products in 1998, CDRH approved in FY 98 the
following significant PMA products: </P>
         <P>Two devices to evaluate an antigen produced by some breast
cancer cells. The results of the test are used to determine
cancer prognosis of the patient and take appropriate preventive
measures.</P>
<UL>
<LI>       A thermal balloon system for treating women with uterine
bleeding disorders.
<LI>        A device to treat chronic, full-thickness skin ulcers that
have not responded to conventional therapy.
         The following devices were approved under HDE PMAs:
<LI>        A finger joint replacement for people who have had implant
failures or for whom available alternatives would be
unsatisfactory because they work with their hands.
<LI>        A bladder stimulation device for children with neurogenic
bladder disorders as a result of spina bifida.
<LI>        A coronary bypass graft for people who don't have enough
vessels suitable for grafting.  
<LI>        A device for hemophiliacs which lowers the levels of
inhibitors of factor XIII or IX, so that patients can resume
receiving routine clotting factor replacement.</UL>
