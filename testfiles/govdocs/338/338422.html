<p>The final rule establishing LCDs was published November 11, 2003. Effective December 7, 2003, CMS's contractors will begin issuing LCDs instead of LMRPs. Over the next 2 years (until December 31, 2005) contractors will convert all existing LMRPs into LCDs and articles. Until the conversion is complete, for purposes of a 522 challenge, the term LCD will refer to both 1.) Reasonable and necessary provisions of an LMRP and, 2.) an LCD that contains only reasonable and necessary language. Any non-reasonable and necessary language a contractor wishes to communicate to providers must be done through an article.</p>

The summarized cost rate includes the cost of reaching and maintaining a "target" trust fund level, known as a contingency fund ratio. Because a trust fund level of about 1 year's expenditures is considered to be an adequate reserve for unforeseen contingencies, the targeted contingency fund ratio used in determining summarized cost rates is 100 percent of annual expenditures. Accordingly, the summarized cost rate is equal to the ratio of (1) the sum of the present value of the outgo during the period, plus the present value of the targeted ending trust fund level, plus the beginning trust fund level, to (2) the present value of the taxable payroll during the period.</p>

<p>Summarized income rates and cost rates are calculated for each of 66 valuation periods within the full 75-year long-range projection period under the intermediate assumptions.

The long-range test is met if, for each of the 66 time periods, the actuarial balance is not less than zero or is negative by, at most, a specified percentage of the summarized cost rate for the same time period. The percentage allowed for a negative actuarial balance is 5 percent for the full 75-year period and is reduced uniformly for shorter periods, approaching zero as the duration of the time periods approaches the first 10 years. The criterion for meeting the test is less stringent for the longer periods in recognition of the greater uncertainty associated with estimates for more distant years.
