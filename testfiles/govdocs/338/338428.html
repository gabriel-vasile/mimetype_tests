<b>QUESTIONS THAT WON'T BE ASKED ABOUT IRAQ</b></p>

<p>Soon we hope to have hearings on the pending war with Iraq. I am concerned
there are some questions that won’t be asked- and maybe will not even be
allowed to be asked.&nbsp; Here are some questions I would like answered by
those who are urging us to start this war.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left">1. Is it not true that the reason we did not bomb the Soviet
  Union at the height of the Cold War was because we knew they <u>could</u>
  retaliate?</p>
  <p align="left">2. Is it not also true that we are willing to bomb Iraq now
  because we know it <u>cannot </u>retaliate- which just confirms that there is <i>no
  real threat</i>?</p>
  <p align="left">3. Is it not true that those who argue that even <u>with</u>
  inspections we cannot be sure that Hussein might be hiding weapons, at the
  same time imply that we can be more sure that weapons exist <u>in the absence
  of</u> inspections?</p>
  <p align="left">4. Is it not true that the UN’s International Atomic Energy
  Agency was able to complete its yearly verification mission to Iraq just this
  year with Iraqi cooperation?</p>
  <p align="left">5. Is it not true that the intelligence community has been
  unable to develop a case tying Iraq to global terrorism at all, much less the
  attacks on the United States last year? Does anyone remember that 15 of the 19
  hijackers came from Saudi Arabia and that none came from Iraq?</p>
  <p align="left">6. Was former CIA counter-terrorism chief Vincent Cannistraro
  wrong when he recently said there is no confirmed evidence of Iraq’s links
  to terrorism?</p>
  <p align="left">7. Is it not true that the CIA has concluded there is no
  evidence that a Prague meeting between 9/11 hijacker Atta and Iraqi
  intelligence took place?</p>
  <p align="left">8. Is it not true that northern Iraq, where the administration
  claimed al-Qaeda were hiding out, is in the control of our &quot;allies,&quot;
  the Kurds?</p>
  <p align="left">9. Is it not true that the vast majority of al-Qaeda leaders
  who escaped appear to have safely made their way to Pakistan, another of our
  so-called allies?</p>
  <p align="left">10. Has anyone noticed that Afghanistan is rapidly sinking
  into total chaos, with bombings and assassinations becoming daily
  occurrences; and that according to a recent UN report the al-Qaeda &quot;is,
  by all accounts, alive and well and poised to strike again, how, when, and
  where it chooses&quot;?</p>

<p align="left">11. Why are we taking precious military and intelligence resources away from tracking
down those who did attack the United States- and who may again attack the United States- and using them to
invade countries that have not attacked the United States? </p>

 <p align="left">12. Would an attack on Iraq not just confirm the Arab world's worst suspicions about the US, and isn't this what
bin Laden wanted?</p>

<p align="left">13. How can Hussein be
compared to Hitler when he has no navy or air force, and now has an army 1/5 the size of twelve years ago, which even then proved totally inept at defending the
country? </p>

  <p align="left">14. Is it not true that the constitutional power to declare
  war is exclusively that of the Congress? Should presidents, contrary to the
  Constitution, allow Congress to concur only when pressured by public opinion?
  Are presidents permitted to rely on the UN for permission to go to war?</p>
  <p align="left">15. Are you aware of a Pentagon report studying charges that
  thousands of Kurds in one village were gassed by the Iraqis, which found no
  conclusive evidence that Iraq was responsible, that Iran occupied the very
  city involved, and that evidence indicated the type of gas used was more
  likely controlled by Iran not Iraq?</p>
  <p align="left">16. Is it not true that anywhere between 100,000 and 300,000
  US soldiers have suffered from Persian Gulf War syndrome from the first Gulf
  War, and that thousands may have died?</p>
  <p align="left">17. Are we prepared for possibly thousands of American
  casualties in a war against a country that does not have the capacity to
  attack the United States?</p>
  <p align="left">18. Are we willing to bear the economic burden of a 100
  billion dollar war against Iraq, with oil prices expected to skyrocket and
  further rattle an already shaky American economy? How about an estimated 30
  years occupation of Iraq that some have deemed necessary to &quot;build
  democracy&quot; there?</p>
  <p align="left">19. Iraq’s alleged violations of UN resolutions are given as
  reason to initiate an attack, yet is it not true that hundreds of UN
  Resolutions have been ignored by various countries without penalty?</p>
  <p align="left">20. Did former President Bush not cite the UN Resolution of
  1990 as the reason he could <i>not</i> march into Baghdad, while supporters of
  a new attack assert that it is the very reason we <i>can</i> march into
  Baghdad?</p>
  <p align="left">21. Is it not true that, contrary to current claims, the
  no-fly zones were set up by Britain and the United States without specific
  approval from the United Nations?</p>
  <p align="left">22. If we claim membership in the international community and
  conform to its rules only when it pleases us, does this not serve to undermine
  our position, directing animosity toward us by both friend and foe?</p>

<p align="left">23. How can our declared goal of bringing democracy to Iraq be believable when we prop
up dictators throughout the Middle East and support military tyrants like Musharaf in Pakistan, who
overthrew a democratically-elected president? </p>

  <p align="left">24. Are you familiar with the 1994 Senate Hearings that
  revealed the U.S. knowingly supplied chemical and biological materials to Iraq
  during the Iran-Iraq war and as late as 1992- including <i>after</i> the
  alleged Iraqi gas attack on a Kurdish village?</p>
  <p align="left">25. Did we not assist Saddam Hussein’s rise to power by
  supporting and encouraging his invasion of Iran? Is it honest to criticize
  Saddam now for his invasion of Iran, which at the time we actively supported?</p>
  <p align="left">26. Is it not true that preventive war is synonymous with an
  act of aggression, and has never been considered a moral or legitimate US
  policy?</p>
  <p align="left">27. Why do the oil company executives strongly support this
  war if oil is not the real reason we plan to take over Iraq?</p>
  <p align="left">28. Why is it that those who never wore a uniform and are
  confident that they won’t have to personally fight this war are more anxious
  for this war than our generals?</p>
  <p align="left">29. What is the moral argument for attacking a nation that has
  not initiated aggression against us, and could not if it wanted?</p>
  <p align="left">30. Where does the Constitution grant us permission to wage
  war for any reason other than self-defense?</p>
  <p align="left">31. Is it not true that a war against Iraq rejects the
  sentiments of the time-honored Treaty of Westphalia, nearly 400 years ago,
  that countries should never go into another for the purpose of regime change?</p>
  <p align="left">32. Is it not true that the more civilized a society is, the
  less likely disagreements will be settled by war?</p>
  <p align="left">33. Is it not true that since World War II Congress has not
  declared war and- not coincidentally- we have not since then had a clear-cut
  victory?</p>
  <p align="left">34. Is it not true that Pakistan, especially through its
  intelligence services, was an active supporter and key organizer of the
  Taliban?</p>
<p align="left">35. Why don't those who want war bring a formal declaration of war resolution to the
floor of Congress? </p>
