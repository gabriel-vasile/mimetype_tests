    <P>Every planet in the solar system has seasons. Most have four
    like the Earth -- called Winter, Spring, Summer and Fall -- but
    that's where the similarities end. Extraterrestrial seasons are
    hardly noticeable on some planets (Venus), mindbogglingly extreme
    on others (Uranus) and in some cases simply impossible to define
    (Mercury). <BR>
<BR>
    The table below gives the dates of the seasons for 8 of the 9
    planets in the solar system. Only Pluto is missing. It's so far
    away that we don't know much about seasons on that distant world.
<BR>
<BR>
    In the table the equinoxes and solstices are named after the
    corresponding season in the northern hemisphere. This is the
    convention that astronomers often use to discuss planetary seasons.
    When the north pole of a planet is tilted toward the sun, astronomers
    call it the Summer Solstice; when the south pole is tilted toward
    the sun it is called the Winter Solstice. Nevertheless, the seasons
    are always opposite in the two hemispheres. On Earth, for example,
    when it is summer in New York, it is winter in Sydney. On a spring
    day in Paris, autumn leaves are falling in Argentina, and so
    on... <BR>
<BR>
    When the Vernal Equinox takes place on March 20, Earth will join
    Venus and Jupiter as the only planets in the solar system where
    it is now northern Spring.</P>

    <P><BR>
    Planetary seasons are caused by <U>two factors</U>: axial tilt
    and variable distance from the sun (orbital eccentricity). Earth's
    orbit is nearly circular and so has little effect on climate.
    It's our planet's axial tilt that causes almost all seasonal
    changes. When the north pole is tilted toward the Sun, it's northern
    summer. Six months later the north pole tilts away from the Sun
    and we experience northern winter. <BR>
<BR>
    The other two planets where it is northern spring, Jupiter and
    Venus, have very small axial tilts -- just 3 degrees compared
    to Earth's 23.5 degree tilt. Seasonal changes on those planets
    are correspondingly small. Spring on Venus isn't much different
    from autumn. The planet's dense, acidic atmosphere produces a
    runaway greenhouse effect that keeps the surface at 750 K year-round
    -- that's hot enough to melt lead. Spring fever on Venus is really
    hot! <BR>

    NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="274"></A>Our second-nearest
    planetary neighbor Mars has the highest orbital eccentricity
    of any world except Pluto. Its distance from the Sun varies between
    1.64 and 1.36 AU over the Martian year. This large variation,
    combined with an axial tilt greater than Earth's gives rise to
    seasonal changes far greater than we experience even in Antarctica.

     SIZE="-1" FACE="arial,helvetica">: Over the past six months,
    the southern hemisphere of Mars has passed through spring and
    into summer. Spring started in early August 1999 and summer arrived
    toward the end of December 1999. Mars Global Surveyor is in a
    polar orbit, thus the spacecraft's camera has had an excellent
    view of seasonal changes. Shown here are three views of the same
    portion the layered terrain near the Martian south pole. They
    show how the landscape thaws and defrosts as summer approaches.

<BR>
    From the point of view of an Earth-dweller, one of the strangest
    effects of seasons on Mars is the change in atmospheric pressure.
    During winter the global atmospheric pressure on Mars is 25%
    lower than during summer. This happens because of the eccentricity
    of Mars's orbit and a complex exchange of carbon dioxide between
    Mars's dry-ice polar caps and its CO2 atmosphere. Around the
    summer solstice when the Martian north pole is tilted away from
    the sun, the northern polar cap expands as carbon dioxide in
    the polar atmosphere freezes. At the other end of the planet
    the southern polar cap melts, giving CO<sub>2</sub> back to the
    atmosphere. This process reverses half a year later at the winter
    solstice. <BR>
<BR>
    At first it might seem that these events occurring at opposite
    ends of Mars would simply balance out over the course of the
    Martian year, having no net effect on climate. But they don't.
    That's because Mars is 10% closer to the Sun in winter than it
    is in summer. At the time of the winter solstice the northern
    polar cap absorbs more CO<sub>2</sub> than the southern polar
    cap absorbs half a year later. The difference is so great that
    Mars's atmosphere is noticeably thinner during winter.</P>

    Martian seasons are peculiar by Earth standards, but they probably
    pale in comparison to seasons on Uranus. Like Earth, the orbit
    of Uranus is nearly circular so it keeps the same distance from
    the Sun throughout its long year. But, Uranus's spin axis is
    tilted by a whopping 82 degrees! This gives rise to extreme 20-year-long
    seasons and unusual weather. For nearly a quarter of the Uranian
    year (equal to 84 Earth years), the sun shines directly over
    each pole, leaving the other half of the planet plunged into
    a long, dark, frigid winter. <BR>

<BR>
    The Northern Hemisphere of Uranus is just now coming out of the
    grip of its decades-long winter. As the sunlight reaches some
    latitudes for the first time in years, it warms the atmosphere
    and triggers gigantic springtime storms comparable in size to
    North America with temperatures of 300 degrees below zero. In
    the animation pictured left the bright clouds are probably made
    of crystals of methane, which condense as warm bubbles of gas
    well up from deep in the atmosphere of Uranus. <BR>
<BR>
    Uranus does not have a solid surface, but is instead a ball of
    mostly hydrogen and helium. Absorption of red light by methane
    in the atmosphere gives the planet its cyan color. Uranus was
    discovered March 13, 1781, by William Herschel. Early visual
    observers reported Jupiter-like cloud belts on the planet, but
    when NASA's Voyager 2 flew by in 1986, Uranus appeared as featureless
    as a cue ball. In the past 13 years, the planet has moved far
    enough along its orbit for the sun to shine at mid-latitudes
    in the Northern Hemisphere. By the year 2007, the sun will be
    shining directly over Uranus' equator.</P>

    Mercury's seasons -- if they can be called that -- are also remarkable.
    Until the 1960's it was thought that Mercury's &quot;day&quot;
    was the same length as its &quot;year&quot; keeping the same
    face to the Sun much as the Moon does to the Earth. This was
    shown to be incorrect by Doppler radar observations. We now known
    that Mercury rotates three times during two of its years. Mercury
    is the only body in the solar system tidally locked into an orbital-to-rotational
    resonance with a ratio other than 1:1. <BR>
<BR>
    This fact and the high eccentricity of Mercury's orbit would
    produce very strange effects for an observer on Mercury's surface.
    [<A HREF="http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/mercury.html">ref</A>]
    At some longitudes the observer would see the Sun rise and then
    gradually increase in apparent size as it slowly moved toward
    the zenith. At that point the Sun would stop, briefly reverse
    course, and stop again before resuming its path toward the horizon
    and decreasing in apparent size. All the while the stars would
    be moving three times faster across the sky. Observers at other
    points on Mercury's surface would see different but equally bizarre
    motions. <BR>

    Temperature variations on Mercury are the most extreme in the
    solar system ranging from 90 K at night to 700 K during the day.
