<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tim Weiner’s <em>Legacy of Ashes</em> is not the definitive history
of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) that it purports to be. Nor is it the
well researched work that many reviewers say it is. It is odd, in fact, that
much of the hype surrounding the book concerns its alleged mastery of available
sources. Weiner and his favorable reviewers—most, like Weiner, journalists—have
cited the plethora of his sources as if the fact of their variety and number by
themselves make the narrative impervious to criticism.</p>
<p>But the thing about scholarship is that one must use sources
honestly, and one doesn’t get a pass on this even if he is a Pulitzer
Prize-winning journalist for the <em>New York Times</em>. Starting with a title that is
based on a gross distortion of events, the book is a 600-page op-ed piece
masquerading as serious history; it is the advocacy of a particularly dark
point of view under the guise of scholarship. Weiner has allowed his agenda to
drive his research and writing, which is, of course, exactly backwards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>History, fairly done, is all about context, motivations, and
realistic expectations in addition to the accurate portrayal of events. Weiner
is not honest about context, he is dismissive of motivations, his expectations
for intelligence are almost cartoonish, and his book too often is factually
unreliable. What could have been a serious historical critique illuminating the
lessons of the past is undermined by dubious assertions, sweeping judgments
based on too few examples, selective or outright misuse of citations, a
drama-driven narrative, and a tendentious and nearly exclusive focus on failure
that overlooks, downplays, or explains away significant successes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The irony is that a new history of CIA is needed to fill the
gap left by the now dated works of John Ranelagh (<em>The Agency</em>, 1986) and
Christopher Andrew (<em>For the President’s Eyes Only</em>, 1995). Having read the book,
I have to conclude that this is not it; anyone who wants a balanced perspective
of CIA and its history should steer well clear of <em>Legacy of Ashes</em>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><em>The Deceit in the Title</em></h3>
<p>The phrase “legacy of ashes” comes from a critical remark
President Dwight D. Eisenhower uttered near the end of his administration when,
Weiner tells us, Ike finally blew up at Director of Central Intelligence (DCI)
Allen Dulles and the failings of CIA generally, and more particularly at
Dulles’s resistance to recommendations for intelligence reform from the
president’s board of consultants. Here’s how Weiner treats the episode, under
the subhead “An Eight-Year Defeat” (page 166).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;<em>“A great deal has been
accomplished,” Dulles insisted to the president at the final gatherings of
Eisenhower’s National Security Council. Everything is well in hand, he said. I
have fixed the clandestine service. American intelligence has never been more
agile and adept. Coordination and cooperation are better than they have ever
been. The proposals of the president’s intelligence board were preposterous, he
said, they were madness, they were illegal. I am responsible under the law for
intelligence coordination, he reminded the president. I cannot delegate that
responsibility. Without my leadership, he said, American intelligence would be
a “body floating in thin air.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;<em>At the last, Dwight
Eisenhower exploded in anger and frustration. “The structure of our
intelligence organization is faulty,” he told Dulles. It makes no sense, it has
to be reorganized, and we should have done it long ago. Nothing had changed
since Pearl Harbor. “I have suffered an
eight-year defeat on this,” said the president of the United States.
He said he would “leave a legacy of ashes” to his successor.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="pullquote">
<p><em>The central episode in Weiner’s book is an invented dialogue, a created
exchange that never happened.</em></p>
</blockquote>
This
     incident serves as an iconic moment in the book, the cornerstone of the
     entire edifice, a sort of literary fractal that encapsulates in microcosm
     all that Weiner thinks is wrong with CIA: its unrelenting record of
     failures, its non-responsiveness—and even duplicity—to presidents, its
     cowboy-ish autonomy and resistance to accountability and oversight. <em>But
     this central episode in Weiner’s book is an invented dialog, a created
     exchange that never happened.</em> An examination of the source documents shows
     that:
<ul><li>Dulles
     made his remarks (“body floating in thin air”) at a meeting of the
     National Security Council (NSC) on 12 January 1961, and he was speaking
     against a Defense Department proposal to separate the position of DCI from
     the management of CIA.

</li><li>Eisenhower’s
     supposed retort (“eight-year defeat…legacy of ashes”) occurred a week
     earlier, at the 5 January NSC meeting, and had nothing to do with CIA.
     Eisenhower was expressing frustration at what he considered his major
     failing regarding intelligence—his inability to reform and streamline
     <em>military</em> intelligence.

</li><li>Far
     from criticizing Dulles and CIA, Eisenhower at both meetings affirmed the
     Agency’s central role in the collection and correlation of strategic
     intelligence while criticizing the redundancy and expense of having four
     separate military intelligence agencies.</li><li>The
     words “preposterous” and “madness” are nowhere to be found in the record
     of Dulles’s remarks on proposals to reform intelligence. <a title="[1] Memoranda
of Discussions at the 473rd Meeting (5 January 1961) and the 474th Meeting (12
January 1961) of the National Security Council;..." href="/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol51no3/legacy-of-ashes-the-history-of-cia.html#-1-memoranda-of">1</a></li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;<br />Here is the critical paragraph from the minutes of the 5
January meeting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The President then
remarked that soon after Pearl Harbor, he was
engaged in an operation which required him to have certain information which he
was unable to obtain from the Navy, i.e., the strength the Navy had left in the
Pacific. The President also noted that the U.S.
fought the first year of the war in Europe
entirely on the basis of British intelligence. Subsequently, each Military
Service developed its own intelligence organization. He thought the situation
made little sense in managerial terms. He had suffered an eight-year defeat on
this question but would leave a legacy of ashes for his successor.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;A Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist has distorted what was
said, why it was said, when it was said, and the circumstances under which it
was said—all to support his thesis that CIA has been a continuous failure from
1947 up to the present. Weiner’s use of the plural “final gatherings” in the
excerpt from his account suggests he knows what he is doing.</p>
<p><a href="/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol51no3/legacy-of-ashes-the-history-of-cia.html#elegy-of-slashes">[Top of page]</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><em>The Preface as Fractal</em></h3>
<p>The book’s preface, an “Author’s Note,” is another literary
fractal that in four-and-a-half pages reveals all the problems of
interpretation, evidence, and scholarship that follow throughout the entire
book. <a title="[2] Weiner,
xiv–xvii." href="/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol51no3/legacy-of-ashes-the-history-of-cia.html#-2-weiner-xiv">2 </a>Weiner is on thin ice from the opening lines: “the most powerful
country in the history of Western civilization has failed to create a
first-rate spy service.” Yet at no point in the 671 pages of narrative and
notes does Weiner offer a basis for his standards—other than suggesting that
mistakes just shouldn’t be made—or explain what his “first rate” intelligence
service might look like.</p>
<p>The intelligence services that are often judged to be
superior to CIA—the Israeli Mossad, the Cuban DGI, the East German Stasi, and
even the British SIS—are far more limited in focus and scope. CIA from the
beginning was charged with worldwide coverage in all intelligence areas,
something no other service, except perhaps the Soviet KGB, was required to do.
If making no mistakes is Weiner’s only standard, he has adopted an unrealistic
one—a Platonic ideal for intelligence—that CIA, dealing with the world as it
is, could only have failed to meet.</p>
<blockquote class="pullquote">
<p class="TwoColumnPullQuote"><em>There is a difference between warning of the day and time of the next
attack and providing analysis that helps presidents and other policymakers
understand circumstances and act to affect outcomes.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>CIA’s central “crime,” as Weiner puts it in the opening
pages, is its consistent failure to inform presidents, which he equates with
predicting the future. This is a rather sophomoric view of what intelligence
can reasonably be expected to do. Throughout the book Weiner repeats the mantra
that the Agency was created “to prevent another Pearl
 Harbor.” True enough, but if CIA had existed in the fall of 1941,
it would have been telling policymakers of Japanese capabilities, analyzing
Tokyo’s intentions, drawing attention to the vulnerabilities of our Pacific
bases, including Pearl Harbor, and by November estimating that war was
imminent—not going for a prediction that at 0755 on 7 December, the Japanese
would strike (though, of course, credible intelligence of that sort would have
been welcome).</p>
<p>There is a difference between warning of the day and time of
the next attack and providing analysis that helps presidents and other
policymakers understand circumstances and act to affect outcomes, an aspect of
the process Weiner—who has written about US intelligence activities and
organizations for some time—somehow seems not to have learned.</p>
<p>There are other lapses. Weiner’s opening note asserts that,
in CIA’s history, US presidents ordered the Agency to undertake covert action
when CIA could not provide knowledge of adversaries; that CIA lied to
presidents to conceal its failures and preserve its standing in Washington;
that CIA analysts “learned to march in lockstep” to conform to what the
president wanted to hear; that all of the Agency’s Soviet assets were executed;
and that the “Islamic warriors” CIA supported in Afghanistan later turned on
the United States. Overall, in his view, the few successes have been
“fleeting,” while the many failures are “long-lasting.” Heady stuff, these
assertions—but every one of them is wrong (some are not even consistent with
each other), and this is just the tip of the iceberg.</p>

<h3><br /><em>Failures R Us</em></h3>
<p>Moving into the book itself, the reader finds a ceaseless
drumbeat of failure. The main theme of <em>Legacy of Ashes</em> is that the CIA has been
a consistent and essentially inexcusable failure since the beginning, over the
decades, and up to the present moment.</p>
<p>No objective observer of Agency history can fail to note
that CIA in its history has failed—sometimes miserably—in what it set out to do
or was ordered to do. As a CIA historian, I’ve been accused of dwelling too
much, in fact, on the failures, a few of which are real doozies. Most of us in
the profession take these cases very much to heart, endeavoring to learn as
much from them as we can so we can do better.</p>
<p>It is a task that requires constant attention. Among
difficult human endeavors the profession of intelligence is an activity that
seems by its very nature to have a higher probability of failure. Everything
intelligence is called upon to do is inherently, inescapably difficult: to
reveal what is hidden, most often deliberately by people who mean us harm; to
ascertain trends and look into the future; to push the bounds of science and
technology to collect what otherwise would be uncollectible and therefore
unknowable; to test the limits of human ingenuity and courage in old-fashioned
spying and counterespionage; and to estimate what it all means. These are not
trifling challenges.</p>
<p>Consider further that these difficult tasks are being
attempted by mortal men and women, all of whom by virtue of the human condition
are fallible and imperfect: not a superhero among them, outside of the
imaginations of novelists and screenwriters. The logic is inexorable: if the
tasks are very hard, and the human raw material is flawed, inevitably there
will be failure.</p>
<p>This suggests that a fair treatment of intelligence and a
realistic assessment of its history, if not tending toward a sense of
forgiveness, would at least attempt to understand the very human context of
what must be a record that will include failures. This context is especially
necessary in appraising the early years of CIA, when enormous challenges were
faced by a new generation for whom intelligence was something learned through often-bitter
experience.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;<em><br />Success versus Failure?
Success IS Failure</em></h3>
<p><a title="Elegy of Slashes" href="/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol51no3/legacy-of-ashes-the-history-of-cia.html#elegy-of-slashes"></a>Weiner’s central theme of unremitting failure does an
injustice to the truth, not least because the existence of real Agency
achievements cannot be denied. Moreover, Weiner’s secondary theme, that Agency
leaders learned to lie to portray CIA’s failures as successes, is inaccurate
and requires one to believe US
presidents are dolts.</p>
<p>Allen Dulles freely admitted to President Eisenhower that
CIA had no sources in the Kremlin, that its Soviet estimates relied more on
speculation and “the logic of the situation” than on hard evidence, and that
the Agency could not reliably warn of a sudden Soviet attack (pages 73–75).
This was not a unique occasion of truthfulness, and it does not sound like an
Agency trying to hide its shortcomings.</p>
<p>Weiner even manages to portray genuine CIA successes as
failures. For example, in 1948 CIA accurately assessed the chance for war with
the Soviets as nil; according to Weiner, that was a failure because “no one
listened”—likewise with accurate Agency predictions of genocide in Rwanda
in 1994.</p>
<p>He portrays the development of the U-2 spyplane—a stunning
technological achievement—as a failure because, he says, CIA should have had
better human sources inside the USSR.
If we had only developed “a bigger picture of life inside the Soviet Union”
that revealed the Russians “were unable to produce the necessities of life”
(page 114), we would not have had to create the unprecedented capability to
take pictures of Soviet military power from 70,000 feet. Never mind that the
Soviets had built and would continue to build a formidable and genuinely
threatening military machine for decades to come.</p>
<p>Oddly, in the video trailer for the book on his publisher’s
Web site, Weiner contradicts himself about the utility of the reconnaissance
efforts. He describes as a success the development of spy satellites, and the
analysis from satellite imagery, that, in his words, “helped keep the Cold War
cold.” This is significant. If CIA had had no other success in its history, the
Agency deserves more credit than Weiner allows for keeping the Cold War from
becoming a hot war, presumably a nuclear war. In the book, Weiner gives the
Agency no credit on this point.</p>
<p>Other successes Weiner obscures or otherwise marginalizes.
For example, discussing the successful covert support of democracy in Italy in 1948,
Weiner belittles the prospects of a communist takeover and then implies that
CIA’s achievement had little real effect other than to encourage more such
operations. The Berlin Tunnel operation gets short shrift, and the story of
CIA’s first major Soviet spy, Pyotr Popov, is buried in a footnote. Weiner
ascribes the Agency’s spot-on call regarding the 1967 Mideast
war wholly to liaison service information rather than to the rigorous analytic
work that was behind the judgment. <a title="[3] See David Robarge, “Getting
it Right: CIA Analysis of the 1967 Arab-Israeli War,” Studies in Intelligence
49, No. 1 (2005)." href="/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol51no3/legacy-of-ashes-the-history-of-cia.html#-3-see-david">3</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><em>Dramatic Assertions, Cheap
Shots</em></h3>
<p>Throughout his book, Weiner has a distressing tendency to
make compelling, usually damning statements about CIA—its leaders, operations,
and programs—and about US
presidents that are untrue. Many of these assertions he even undermines in his
subsequent narrative.</p>
<p>A prominent early example, in which Weiner sets the stage
for his view that CIA overstepped its boundaries from the beginning, is the
first sentence of chapter 1: “All Harry Truman wanted was a newspaper.” Weiner
then repeats the myth, long discounted, that President Truman wanted his
intelligence service just to produce a daily report. A few pages later,
however, Weiner tells how Truman gave the first director of central
intelligence a black hat, a cloak, and a wooden dagger—which make for a
pointless joke if all Truman wanted was a classified version of the <em>New York Times</em>.</p>
<p>In fact, Truman signed NSC directives assigning the
responsibility for covert action to CIA, a duty CIA officials had misgivings
about at the time. Weiner goes on to mention that, by the way, there were 81
covert actions approved by the NSC and carried out by CIA during Truman’s term,
including significant paramilitary operations in the Korean War.</p>
<p>Weiner is forced by his own premise to then assert the
incredible: that Harry Truman didn’t know what was going on in his own
administration regarding Cold War covert activities. To accept that, you need
an imagination like Oliver Stone’s to believe that Truman’s secretaries of
state and defense, his military commanders, his advisers Clark Clifford and
former DCI Sidney Souers, his own secretary, plus George Kennan at the State
Department, as well as Directors Vandenberg, Hillenkoetter and Smith—all
conspired to keep this form of warfare a secret from the president.</p>
<p>Yet publicly available documents, which Weiner seems to be unaware
of or ignores, make an overwhelming case that President Truman was informed
frequently of NSC and other policy discussions on covert operations and CIA’s
role in them. In Michael Warner, ed., <em>CIA Cold War Records: The CIA Under Harry
Truman </em>(CIA History Staff, 1994) is a memo from the DCI dated 23 April 1952 to
the NSC about CIA activities. It includes (pages 459–60) a discussion of “cold
war covert activities, including guerrilla warfare.” The document is marked
“Included in the President’s Book.”</p>
<p>Weiner might also have read Hayden Peake, “Harry S. Truman
on CIA Covert Activities,” in <em>Studies in Intelligence</em> 25, No. 1 (1981). Peake
demonstrates that, Truman’s stated opposition to Eisenhower- and Kennedy-era
covert operations notwithstanding, CIA officials of the late 1940s and early
1950s considered Truman to have been intimately involved in the development of
CIA’s covert mission.</p>
<p>Weiner might also have examined more closely the holdings of
the Truman Library, where he would have been able to see a progress report sent
by DCI Souers to the president in June 1946 on “planning for psychological
warfare” on the part of the Central Intelligence Group; <a title="[4] “Progress
Report” memo of 7 June 1948, Harry S. Truman Library, Papers of Clark Clifford,
available through the Declassified Documents..." href="/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol51no3/legacy-of-ashes-the-history-of-cia.html#-4-progress-report">4</a> he might also have
taken note of the NSC memorandums for the president summarizing NSC discussions
of 20 May and 3 June 1948 concerning psychological and political warfare, also
in the Truman Library, President’s Secretary’s files. <a title="[5] These
are reprinted as documents 277 and 283 in Foreign Relations of the United
States, 1945–1950: Emergence of the Intelligence..." href="/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol51no3/legacy-of-ashes-the-history-of-cia.html#-5-these-are">5</a></p>
<p>He misses other important evidence of Truman’s knowledge of
such activity, such as the Acting DCI’s 16 January 1951 report to the NSC on
“Responsibilities of CIA (OPC) with Respect to Guerrilla Warfare.” <a title="[6] Truman
Library, President’s Secretary’s files and available through DDRS." href="/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol51no3/legacy-of-ashes-the-history-of-cia.html#-6-truman-library">6</a> Weiner
does cite the 23 October 1951 NSC report on “Scope and Pace of Covert
Operations,” but he misses the significance of this document’s presence in the
files of Truman’s secretary—unless Weiner is implying that she was in on the
aforementioned conspiracy to keep him in the dark.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><em>A Circle of Incompetents?</em></h3>
<p>Weiner’s portrayal of CIA leaders, especially in the
Agency’s first decades, drips with hostility—something that even favorable
reviewers have criticized. <a title="[7] See,
for example, David Wise’s review in the Washington Post, 22 July 2007." href="/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol51no3/legacy-of-ashes-the-history-of-cia.html#-7-see-for">7</a>&nbsp; His prose
forces one to conclude that the Agency was led by incompetent louts ignorant of
the world and duplicitous with higher authority.</p>
<p>Frank Wisner, a passionate and driven man who led covert
operations for many years, comes in for especially rough treatment. Weiner
portrays him as absolutely autonomous, out of control, accountable to no one:
“He alone would decide whether his secret missions conformed to American
foreign policy” (page&nbsp;32). But even Weiner’s animosity can’t get in the
way of unavoidable facts—<em>on the very next page, </em>one reads that Wisner created
stay-behind agent networks in Europe on the
orders of Secretary of Defense Forrestal. Reading on, one finds that both State
and Defense were pressing Wisner to expand covert action programs in 1951, that
the Joint Chiefs of Staff ordered him to undertake covert operations against
the USSR,
and that all such operations were authorized by George Kennan at State.</p>
<p>Weiner says Wisner successfully resisted orders from DCI
Smith to shut down any covert program, no matter how ineffectual, yet in
reality Wisner complied with orders to end the heavily invested “Third Force”
program in 1953. Wisner is lambasted for doing too much—except during the 1953
East German riots, when Weiner chastizes him for doing nothing.</p>
<p>Weiner asserts that Agency officers consistently
misunderstood the world and communicated that misunderstanding to US
presidents, who then reacted by ordering the CIA to conduct covert actions in
order to change the world to their liking. This thesis is unsupportable from
the historical record. Other commentators (Walter Laqueur, Angelo Codevilla,
e.g.) have noted that one problem with covert action in the Agency’s history is
that it was not sufficiently informed by the Agency’s analysis. For example,
the analysts were completely cut out of deliberations before the Bay of Pigs, and they could have told the operators that
there was no potential for an anti-Castro uprising that the operation was
intended to foment.</p>
<p>One of Weiner’s most unfair assertions is that CIA analysts
“learned to march in lockstep” to conform to how the president saw the world
(page xv). That judgment would come as a surprise to several generations of
analysts in the Directorate of Intelligence, especially those who delivered
unexpected or unwelcome assessments to various administrations on China, Soviet strategic intentions and

<h3><em>ISO Context</em></h3>
<p>Weiner’s predilection for the knockout punch or the cheap
shot might make for successful tabloid journalism, but it is unsatisfactory as
history because it neglects essential context that would provide real
understanding of complex situations. For example, he dismisses the first DCI to
lead CIA, Roscoe Hillenkoetter. Labelling him as an ineffectual leader, Weiner
gives him no credit for trying, as a lowly rear admiral in Washington, to lead this new venture called
Central Intelligence. In an apparent rush to condemn Agency covert action,
Weiner curiously fails to give Hillenkoetter credit for trying to keep the
Agency out of it.</p>
<p>Similarly, Weiner focuses solely on CIA’s problems with the
Gehlen group, the former military officers of Nazi Germany who served as the
basis for West German intelligence, and he omits mention of its valuable
intelligence on the USSR, which “outweighed these problems during the hottest
years of the Cold War,” in the words of a declassified CIA historical
assessment. <a title="[8]
Kevin Ruffner, ed., Forging an Intelligence Partnership: CIA and the Origins of
the BND, 1945-49 (CIA History Staff, 1999; redacted and..." href="/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol51no3/legacy-of-ashes-the-history-of-cia.html#-8-kevin-ruffner">8</a></p>
<p>Weiner also repeats the canard that CIA missed the decline
of the USSR,
something that was obvious to everyone in the world but the Agency. He ignores
several important sources that have refuted this claim: the work of Bruce
Berkowitz, Douglas MacEachin, Robert Gates, and the Case Program of Harvard’s
Kennedy School of Government. CIA analysts warned of the USSR’s
socio-economic troubles from the late 1970s on.</p>
<p>A particularly telling cheap shot is Weiner’s dismissal of
Ronald Reagan as someone who came to the presidency knowing “little more about
the CIA than what he had learned at the movies” (page 375). This is a
wrong-headed view of a president who in 1975 had served on the Rockefeller
Commission investigating intelligence activities and who had drafted for his
own delivery, from 1975 to 1978, radio addresses on national security matters
that included cogent discussions about CIA and intelligence issues. In
addition, a large number of Reagan’s letters and essays has emerged that dispel
Weiner’s notion. <a title="[9] On
Reagan’s views of CIA and intelligence, see Kiron Skinner et al., eds., Reagan,

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><em>Sourcing Sins of Omission and
Commission</em></h3>
<p>Just as he fails to provide context or alternative plausible
explanations, Weiner, like a prosecutor in a trial, pulls from his source
material only that which supports his perspective. Concerning CIA analysis of
the Soviet Union, he quotes the former
director of national estimates at CIA, Abbot Smith, on page 154:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>We had constructed for
ourselves a picture of the USSR,
and whatever happened had to be made to fit into that picture. Intelligence
estimators can hardly commit a more abominable sin.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clearly Smith’s idea of an “abominable sin” doesn’t apply to
this journalist-turned-historian, who doesn’t mention that in the very next
paragraph of the document from which he drew the above quote is the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Abbott balanced his
critique by noting that many of the main points of political analysis of the
USSR had turned out to be valid: emphasis on the continuing strength of party
rule, the importance of heavy industry and the military, and the emergence of
problems with Communist China. <a title="[10] Gerald
K. Haines and Robert E. Leggett, eds., Watching the Bear: Essays on CIA’s
Analysis of the Soviet Union, 70." href="/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol51no3/legacy-of-ashes-the-history-of-cia.html#-10-gerald-k">10</a></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That last point is especially important, for CIA analysis on
the Sino-Soviet relationship was far ahead of the rest of Washington’s and must be counted a success.</p>
<p>Another example: Weiner’s treatment of CIA during the Korean
War (chapter 6) is entirely one-sided, again supported by selective quotation
of sources. His account of error and botched CIA operations relies on the work
of Michael Haas, a former Air Force contract historian who had access to CIA
internal histories on the Korean War. <a title="[11] Michael
E. Haas, In the Devil’s Shadow: UN Special Operations During the Korean War (Annapolis, MD:
Naval Institute Press, 2000),..." href="/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol51no3/legacy-of-ashes-the-history-of-cia.html#-11-michael-e">11</a>&nbsp;
To be sure, those internal histories speak of many failed operations,
especially after 1952, but Weiner fails to report that Haas also wrote of
“noteworthy” HUMINT successes early in the war—one of which contributed to the
successful Inchon landing—as well as collection operations that yielded
intelligence on the enemy’s order of battle and critical targeting information
that resulted in the destruction of a North Korean Communist Party facility.</p>
<p>The one Korean War internal history that has been released
(and available to Weiner) speaks of many successful missions into North Korean
territory, mostly to gather intelligence but also to destroy infrastructure and
to kill enemy combatants. <a title="[12] CIA
in Korea,
1946-1965; released portions concern only the Korean War period." href="/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol51no3/legacy-of-ashes-the-history-of-cia.html#-12-cia-in">12</a> All this is absent from Weiner’s retelling.</p>
<p>Oddly, Weiner goes on at some length concerning what CIA’s
internal histories say about the Korean War, and throughout the book he
frequently cites declassified Agency histories. So it is amusing to read that
“CIA’s covert operators never wrote ‘lessons-learned’ studies.” What does he
think those internal histories were for? While it is debatable whether needed
lessons were really learned, these things were written by the Directorate of
Operations for the Directorate of Operations and invariably included
conclusions intended to improve operations in the future—sometimes explicitly
called “lessons.”</p>
<blockquote class="pullquote">
<p class="TwoColumnPullQuote"><em>There is sloppy scholarship in the recounting of the 1956 Hungarian
Revolution, which in Weiner’s hands becomes a tragicomedy.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>With respect to analysis during the Korean War, Weiner is not
completely up front either. He meticulously documents CIA’s inaccurate
assessments of China’s intent to enter the war in force—based on the Agency’s
flawed premise that Moscow was really behind events on the peninsula—but he
ignores the same sources regarding the Agency’s frequent and consistent
warnings that Chinese deployments gave Beijing the capability of entering the
war. <a title="[13] At
the Truman Library, and available through DDRS, are CIA reports “Situation
Summary 1 Sep 50,” “Interim Situation Summary 30..." href="/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol51no3/legacy-of-ashes-the-history-of-cia.html#-13-at-the">13</a>&nbsp; CIA warned President Truman on 1
September 1950—six weeks before Chinese troops crossed the Yalu into North
Korea—that</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Chinese Communist
propaganda has portrayed the US
as an aggressor…. Thus, the stage has been set for some form of Chinese
Communist intervention or participation in the Korean War…. In any case, some
form of armed assistance to the North Koreans appears imminent.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On 30 September, CIA told Truman that most information
pointed against a Chinese decision “to intervene openly in Korea,” although the
Agency also presented contrary reports—including intelligence from Indian
diplomats in Beijing that the Chinese leadership had swung toward intervention.
As Weiner notes, CIA in mid-October told Truman there were “no convincing
indications” of a Chinese intention “to resort to full-scale intervention.”</p>
<p>What Weiner omits is that this report, “Threat of Full
Chinese Communist Intervention in Korea,” begins with the Agency’s assessment
that Chinese ground forces “are capable of intervening effectively” in the
conflict; that the report discusses the factors arguing for a Chinese
intervention, as well as the factors militating against it, concluding that
continued covert aid was most likely; and that the last paragraph of the report
repeats that “full-scale Chinese Communist intervention in Korea must be
regarded as a continuing possibility” though it was assessed as “not probable
in 1950.”</p>
<p>There is sloppy scholarship at the very least in the
recounting of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, which in Weiner’s hands becomes a
tragicomedy, with Frank Wisner ordering Radio Free Europe (RFE) to incite
violence against the communist regime and against invading Soviet troops—only
to see the uprising crushed. One of Weiner’s major sources for his assertion of
CIA’s culpability is an RFE New York memo, allegedly the result of Wisner’s
“exhortations” to violence, telling the radio’s Hungarian staff in Munich that “All
restraints have gone off. No holds barred.” It’s a significant problem for
Weiner’s thesis that Wisner in 1956 actually had no direct involvement in RFE
and that the memo was produced after the uprising was effectively over and
dealt with rhetoric, not violence.</p>
<p>Weiner also points to an RFE broadcast that predicted the
United States would come to the aid of Hungarian freedom fighters, without
acknowledging that the broadcaster was doing a press review <em>after</em> the Soviet
invasion and was quoting—by name—a London <em>Observer</em> editorial, and that even so
this was a violation of RFE policy, or that this was the sole example of an
implicit hint of assistance in two weeks of continuous broadcasting to Hungary.
The idea that RFE was fomenting violence at the behest of Frank Wisner is not
supported either by Weiner’s sources or by other sources he failed to cite. <a title="[14] Weiner
cites, for example, Arch Puddington’s definitive Broadcasting Freedom
(University Press of Kentucky, 2000) but unaccountably..." href="/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol51no3/legacy-of-ashes-the-history-of-cia.html#-14-weiner-cites">14</a></p>
<p>On CIA’s analysis of Soviet missile development, Weiner
writes, “In 1960, the agency projected [that] the Soviets would have five
hundred ICBMS ready to strike by 1961” (page 158), but Moscow in 1961 only had four. This item is
often mentioned in reviews of <em>Legacy of Ashes</em> as an example of the Agency’s
total incompetence. How could we get it so wrong, especially after years of U-2
coverage?</p>
<blockquote class="pullquote">
<p class="TwoColumnPullQuote">The errors of fact in <em>Legacy of Ashes</em> are numerous and of the kind that a half-way diligent graduate student
would spot.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem is that Weiner got the year wrong: it was in
<em>1957</em>, three years earlier—not long after the shock of the first Soviet ICBM
test and then Sputnik, when Soviet leaders had boasted of turning out rockets
“like sausages,” and while the U-2 program was in its early stages—that CIA and
the Intelligence Community (not just CIA) projected 500 Soviet ICBMs in 1961, <em>four years into the future.</em></p>
<p>Weiner failed both to correctly read his secondary source
and to check primary sources. <a title="[15] Weiner
relied on Raymond Garthoff, “Estimating Soviet Military Intentions and
Capabilities,” in Watching the Bear, 135–86. The actual..." href="/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol51no3/legacy-of-ashes-the-history-of-cia.html#-15-weiner-relied">15</a>&nbsp; If he
had been more careful, he would have found that a National Intelligence
Estimate in 1960 told the president that the Soviets at that time probably had
10 operational ICBMs and would have 50, at most 200, the following year. In
other words, the US Intelligence Community, still animated by worst case
analysis as the prudent course, nevertheless used information from CIA’s U-2
program to scale back significantly its earlier estimate, and CIA’s CORONA
satellite program and its intelligence from Oleg Penkovskiy would soon improve
that score. This should be considered a success, but Weiner uses it as an
occasion to ridicule the Agency.</p>
<p>Enumerating cases of Weiner’s selectivity would take another
600 pages, but I will close with the especially egregious incomplete
explanation of events surrounding the famous “sixteen words” President Bush
used in the 2003 State of the Union address about Saddam Hussein’s alleged
efforts to purchase uranium in Africa. Weiner,
claiming that Bush was making “CIA’s case,” omits mention of the attribution of
the information to British intelligence. Moreover, George Tenet’s recent memoir
makes it clear that the Agency had removed the assertion from previous speeches
and simply had failed to do so for the State of the Union.
CIA, in fact, did not support that statement.<br /><a title="Elegy of Slashes" href="/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol51no3/legacy-of-ashes-the-history-of-cia.html#elegy-of-slashes">[Top of page]</a></p>

<h3><br /><em>Getting Simple Facts Wrong</em></h3>
<p>The errors of fact in <em>Legacy of Ashes</em> are numerous and of
the kind that a half-way diligent graduate student would spot. Following is a
short list:</p>
<ul type="disc"><li>OSS was not “barred from seeing the most important
     intercepted communications” during World War II (page 5); few in any
     organization could view ULTRA intercepts, but within OSS the X-2 counterintelligence branch
     had access.</li><li>The
     distinction between the espionage and covert action missions did not
     emerge in the postwar period (page 11) but years earlier was already part
     of the organizing principle of OSS;
     the Secret Intelligence branch handled what would later be called HUMINT,
     and various other branches were responsible for paramilitary and other
     covert activity.</li><li>The
     1949 CIA Act did not provide the Agency with the legal authority to
     conduct covert action (page 40)—that legislation concerned DCI authorities
     regarding personnel, secrecy, and unvouchered funds (which certainly
     helped operations remain covert); the Agency construed its covert action authority
     from admittedly vague language in the 1947 National Security Act and from
     Executive Orders.</li><li>Weiner
     obviously read (and quotes from) my <em>Studies in Intelligence</em> article on the
     ill-fated flight of Jack Downey and Dick Fecteau in 1952, yet he misrepresented
     a flight to pick up documents as a mission to “rescue” agents who had
     radioed for help (page 60).</li><li>The
     reference to a “CIA colonel” (page 88) is odd; the KGB had colonels, but
     CIA never had military ranks—though it has employed military officers.</li><li>Weiner
     also errs when he says that the current director, Michael Hayden (page
     510), is the first active-duty military officer to lead the Agency since
     the early 1950s—that was Admiral Stansfield Turner (1977).</li><li>Weiner
     says that the 1950s-era program to encourage Soviet walk-ins outside the USSR,
     REDCAP, was not effective and had no significant successes by 1956 (page
     124). He forgets the two Peters, Pyotr Deriabin and Pyotr Popov, both of
     whom were immensely important assets.</li><li>The
     idea that the “Islamic warriors” CIA supported in Afghanistan would later
     turn on the United States (page xv) fails to make the basic distinction
     between the Afghan mujahedin, whom the Agency supported, and Arabs who
     went to Afghanistan in the 1980s—whom CIA did not support.</li><li>John
     McCone was never a deputy secretary of defense (page 180) and did not, as
     DCI, begin mass firings (page 188).</li></ul>

<h3><em><br />So What’s Right About</em> Legacy
of Ashes?<br /><a title="Elegy of Slashes" href="/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol51no3/legacy-of-ashes-the-history-of-cia.html#elegy-of-slashes"></a></h3>
<p>
For all of its profound flaws bits of <em>Legacy of Ashes</em> are
not bad (though Weiner has not earned the trust of the careful scholar
regarding his sources, so best to check).</p>
<p><br />Weiner accurately chronicles much of the chaos of the early
days of CIA espionage and covert action, particularly when the Office of
Strategic Operations and Office of Policy Coordination were separate entities
with separate stations in the field and competing programs (page&nbsp;33).</p>
<p>I actually agree with Weiner that at some point, though I am
not certain where that point is, the dispatch of ethnic agent teams into denied
areas was unconscionable, based on the fact—observable to CIA at the time—that
so few (about 25 percent) were ever heard from again. At the same time, no one
put a gun to the heads of these ethnic agents; they were nationalists, willing
to risk their lives (many fought, unheralded, for years as guerillas against
the Soviets in their homeland without US help), and we were willing to take the
chance that sending them might yield good intelligence or otherwise harm our
adversaries. In the high pressure of the early Cold War—when everyone was
concerned about communist expansion and no one knew how the struggle would come
out—these operations, ill-advised though they may have been, were far more
understandable, if not forgivable, than Weiner allows.</p>
<p>Weiner gets better during the period when he started
covering intelligence as a reporter (Part Six). His recounting of events in the
1990s—the change in CIA’s relationship with the military as a result of the
Gulf War, the effect of the “peace dividend” on Agency resources, and the
debacle of the Clinton administration’s attitudes toward intelligence—seem
accurate and useful summaries.</p>
<blockquote class="pullquote">
<p class="TwoColumnPullQuote"><em>My hunch is that Weiner’s work will soon be replaced by that of a
historian who has seriously attempted to get at more of the “whole truth” of
intelligence, rather than some carefully selected bits intended to highlight an
interpretation.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But these few plusses do not overcome the essential fact
that Legacy of Ashes is a narrowly-focused and biased account. In his preface,
Weiner claims to believe that the intelligence profession is critical to
national security, but he is likely to have done considerable damage, as the
people who take up the profession will, I fear, have to deal with his
inaccuracies and skewed perspectives for years to come.</p>
<p>As to the gap that we in CIA’s History Staff hoped to see
filled, my hunch, and hope, is that Weiner’s work will soon be replaced by that
of a historian who has seriously attempted to get at more of the “whole truth”
of intelligence, rather than carefully selected bits intended to highlight an
interpretation. Then we will have a history that we can learn from to improve
and advance the important work of our nation’s security. <a href="/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol51no3/legacy-of-ashes-the-history-of-cia.html#nicholas-dujmovic">16<br />[Top of page]</a></p>
