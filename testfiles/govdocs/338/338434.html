<td><h3>Purpose 
<tr valign=top><td colspan=2>

<dd>The purpose of this policy statement is to establish specific guidelines 
consistent with the provisions of 28 CFR 50.2 governing the release of 
information relating to criminal and civil cases and matters by all 
components (FBI, DEA, INS, BOP, USMS, USAO, and DOJ divisions) and personnel 
of the Department of Justice. These guidelines are: 1) fully consistent with 
the underlying standards set forth in this statement and with 28 CFR 50.2; 
2) in addition to any other general requirements relating to this issue; 3) 
intended for internal guidance only; and 4) do not create any rights 
enforceable in law or otherwise in any party.<p>

<a name="1-7.110"></a> 
<tr valign=top><td nowrap><h3>1-7.110 
<td><h3>Interests Must Be Balanced
<tr valign=top><td colspan=2>

<dd>These guidelines recognize three principal interests that must be 
balanced: the right of the public to know; an individual's right to a fair 
trial; and, the government's ability to effectively enforce the 
administration of justice.<p>

<a name="1-7.111"></a> 
<tr valign=top><td nowrap><h3>1-7.111
<td><h3>Need for Confidentiality 
<tr valign=top><td colspan=2>

<dd>Careful weight must be given in each case to protecting the rights of 
victims and litigants as well as the protection of the life and safety of 
other parties and witnesses. To this end, the Courts and Congress have 
recognized the need for limited confidentiality in:<p>

<li>On-going operations and investigations; <li>Grand jury and tax matters; 
<li>Certain investigative techniques; and, <li>Other matters protected by 
the law.<p>

<a name="1-7.112"></a>
<tr valign=top><td nowrap><h3>1-7.112
<td><h3>Need for Free Press and Public Trial 
<tr valign=top><td colspan=2>

<dd>Likewise, careful weight must be given in each case to the 
constitutional requirements of a free press and public trials as well as the 
right of the people in a constitutional democracy to have access to 
information about the conduct of law enforcement officers, prosecutors and 
courts, consistent with the individual rights of the accused. Further, 
recognition should be given to the needs of public safety, the apprehension 
of fugitives, and the rights of the public to be informed on matters that 
can affect enactment or enforcement of public laws or the development or 
change of public policy.<p>

<dd>These principles must be evaluated in each case and must involve a fair 
degree of discretion and the exercise of sound judgment, as every 
possibility cannot be predicted and covered by written policy statement.<p>

<tr valign=top><td nowrap><h3>1-7.210
<td><h3>General Responsibility 
<tr valign=top><td colspan=2>

<dd>Final responsibility for all matters involving the news media and the 
Department of Justice is vested in the Director of the Office of Public 
Affairs (OPA). The Attorney General is to be kept fully informed of 
appropriate matters at all times.<p>

<dd>Responsibility for all matters involving the local media is vested in 
the United States Attorney.<p>

<tr valign=top><td colspan=2>

<dd>Each United States Attorney's Office and each field office of the 
various components of the Department shall designate one or more persons to 
act as a point of contact on matters pertaining to the media.<p>

<dd>In United States Attorneys' offices or field offices where available 
personnel resources do not permit the assignment of a full time point of 
contact for the media, these responsibilities should be assigned to a 
clearly identified individual. (This, of course, could be the United States 
Attorney or field office head.)<p>

Bureau of Investigation, Drug Enforcement Administration, Immigration and 
Naturalization Service, Bureau of Prisons, United States Marshals Service, 
Office of Justice Programs, and Community Relations Service are responsible 
for coordinating their news media effort with the Director of OPA.<p>

United States Attorneys are responsible for coordinating their news media 
efforts with the Director of OPA in cases that transcend their immediate 
district or are of national importance.<p>

<tr valign=top><td colspan=2>

<dd>In order to promote coordination with the OPA, all components of the 
Department shall take all reasonable steps to insure compliance with the 
following:<p><ol type=A>

<b><li>International/National/Major Regional News.</b> As far in advance as 
possible, OPA should be informed about any issue that might attract 
international, national, or major regional media interest. However, the OPA 
should be alerted not to comment or disseminate any information to the media 
concerning such issues without first consulting with the United States 
Attorney.<p>

<b><li>News Conferences.</b> Prior coordination with OPA is required of news 
conferences of national significance.<p>

<b><li>Requests from National Media Representatives (TV, Radio, Wire 
Service, Magazines, Newspapers).</b> OPA should be informed immediately of 
all requests from national media organizations, including the television and 
radio programs (such as the nightly news, Good Morning America, Meet the 
Press and Sixty Minutes), national wire services, national news magazines 
and papers (such as the New York Times, U.S.A. Today, and the Wall Street 
Journal) regarding in-depth stories and matters affecting the Department of 
Justice, or matters of national significance.<p>

<b><li>Media Coverage Affecting DOJ.</b> When available, press clippings and 
radio/television tapes involving matters of significance should be forwarded 
to OPA.<p>

<b><li>Comments on Specific Issues (i.e., New Policies, Legislative 
Proposals, Budget).</b> OPC should be consulted for guidance prior to 
commenting on new policies and initiatives, legislative proposals or 
budgetary issues of the Department. This should not be interpreted to 
preclude recitation of existing well-established Departmental policies or 
approved budgets.</ol><p>

<dd><b>By OPA or Headquarters.</b> In instances where OPA or the 
headquarters of any division, component or agency of the Department issues a 
news release or conducts a news conference which may affect an office or the 
United States Attorney, such division, component, or agency will coordinate 
that effort with the appropriate United States Attorney.<p> <p>

<dd><b>Issuance of Press Release by Field Officers of Any Division.</b> In 
instances where local field officers of any division or component plans to 
issue a news release, schedule a news conference or make contact with a 
member of the media relating to any case or matter which may be prosecuted 
by the United States Attorney's office, such release, scheduling of a news 
conference or other media contact shall be approved by the United States 
Attorney. See the <a href="doj00028.htm#28">DOJ Organizations and 
Functions Manual at 28</a> for a discussion of press releases in cases 
involving the Internal Revenue Service.<p>

<tr valign=top><td nowrap><h3>1-7.401 
<td><h3>Guidance for Press Conferences and Other Media Contacts
<tr valign=top><td colspan=2>

<dd>The following guidance should be followed when Department of Justice 
components or investigative agencies consider conducting a press conference 
or other media contact:<ol type=A>
 
<li>The use of a press release which conforms to the approval requirements 
of <a href="#1-7.400">USAM&nbsp;1-7.400</a> is the usual method to release 
public information to the media by Department of Justice components and 
investigative agencies. Press conferences should be held only for the most 
significant and newsworthy actions, or if a particularly important deterrent 
or law enforcement purpose would be served. Prudence and caution should be 
exercised in the conduct of any press conference or other media contact.<p>

<li>Press conferences about pending cases or investigations that may result 
in an indictment by all Department of Justice components and investigative 
agencies must be approved by the appropriate Assistant Attorney General or 
by the United States Attorney responsible for the case. In joint or 
multi-district cases the approving official should consult with other 
districts or divisions affected. If it is a national case, press conferences 
must be approved by the Director, Office of Public Affairs. <i>See</i> <a
href="#1-7.320">USAM&nbsp;1-7.320&nbsp;to&nbsp;1-7.330</a>.<p>

 
<li>There are exceptional circumstances when it may be appropriate to have 
press conferences or other media outreach about ongoing matters before 
indictment or other formal charge. These include cases where: 1) the heinous 
or extraordinary nature of the crime requires public reassurance that the 
matter is being promptly and properly handled by the appropriate authority; 
2) the community needs to be told of an imminent threat to public safety; or 
3) a request for public assistance or information is vital. <i>See</i> <a
href="#1-7.530">USAM&nbsp;1-7.530&nbsp;to&nbsp;1-7.550</a> and 28 C.F.R. 
50.2.<p>

 
<li>There are also circumstances involving substantial public interest when 
it may be appropriate to have media contact about matters after indictment 
or other formal charge but before conviction. In such cases, any 
communications with press or media representatives should be limited to the 
information contained in an indictment or other charging instrument, other 
public pleadings or proceedings, and any other related non-criminal 
information, within the limits of <a href="#1-7.520">USAM&nbsp;1-7.520</a>, 
<a href="#1-7.540">540</a>, <a href="#1-7.550">550</a>, <a
href="#1-7.500">500</a> and 28 C.F.R. 50.2.<p>

 
<li>Any public communication by any Department component or investigative 
agency or their employees about pending matters or investigations that may 
result in a case, or about pending cases or final dispositions, must be 
approved by the appropriate Assistant Attorney General, the United States 
Attorney, or other designate responsible for the case. In joint or 
multi-district cases, the approving official should consult with other 
districts or divisions affected. If it is a national case, press conferences 
must be approved by the Director, Office of Public Affairs.<p>

 
<li>The use of displays or handouts in either press conferences or other 
media outreach when it involves a pending case or an investigation that may 
lead to an indictment requires separate and specific approval by the 
officials authorizing approval as set forth in section B.<p>

 
<li>All Department personnel must avoid any public oral or written 
statements or presentations that may violate any Department guideline or 
regulation, or any legal requirement or prohibitions, including case law and 
local court rules.<p>

 
<li>Particular care must be taken to avoid any statement or presentation 
that would prejudice the fairness of any subsequent legal proceeding. See 
also 28 C.F.R. 16.26(b). In cases where information is based directly or 
indirectly on tax records, care should be taken to comply with any 
applicable disclosure provisions in the Tax Reform Act, section 6103 of the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The fact of conviction, sentences and guilty 
pleas may be reported in a press release based on information uttered in 
court as opposed to waiting for the publicly filed documents relating to the 
fact of conviction, plea or sentence. If you have any questions please 
contact the Tax Division. Special rules apply and should be closely followed 
to ensure that the identity of minors directly or indirectly is not revealed 
in juvenile proceedings.<p>

 
<li>For press releases or other public comment concerning the filing of a 
request for commutation of a federal death sentence or whether such a 
sentence should be commuted, special rules apply. In clemency matters, the 
Department acts both as prosecutor and as advisor to the President on the 
issue of clemency. In order to ensure clarity about the role in which the 
Department is making a public comment and to ensure that there is no 
potential for infringement upon the President's prerogative in exercising 
his clemency powers or conflict in the Department's role in such matters, 
press releases or other comment to the press concerning the issue of 
clemency should be transmitted through the Office of Public Affairs to the 
Deputy Attorney General for final approval.<p>

 
<li>Prior to conducting a press conference or making comments on a pending 
investigation regarding another DOJ component, the U.S. Attorney shall 
coordinate any comments, including any written statements, with the affected 
component.<p>

 
<li>The Office of Inspector General is exempt from any approval requirement 
for media contacts. However, the Office of Inspector General should inform 
the Office of Public Affairs on public or other media issues.<p></ol><p>

which the community needs to be reassured that the appropriate law 
enforcement agency is investigating the incident, or where release of 
information is necessary to protect the public interest, safety, or welfare, 
comments about or confirmation of an ongoing investigation may need to be

<td><h3>Comments on Requests for Investigations 
<tr valign=top><td colspan=2>

<dd>Individuals, groups, or organizations often send letters to the 
Department of Justice or a Department component requesting that a person or 
entity be investigated for violations of law. Sometimes, the requestor then 
conducts a press conference or releases a statement leaving an implication 
that an investigation will result. This can cause media inquiries.<p>

 
<dd>Receipt of a request to open an investigation may be publicly 
acknowledged. Care should be taken to avoid any implication that the 
referral will necessarily lead to an investigation. It should be pointed out 
that there is a distinction between "reviewing a request for an 
investigation" and "opening an investigation."<p>

 
<dd>Any acknowledgment should state that such requests are referred to the 
proper investigative agency for review but that no decision has been made 
whether to proceed on the specific request received. Finally, it should be 
noted that all substantiated allegations are reviewed in light of The 
Principles of Federal Prosecution (see <a
href="../title9/27mcrm.htm">USAM&nbsp;9-27.000</a>), and the Department does 
not ordinarily confirm or deny the existence or status of an 
investigation.<p>

 
<dd>The same considerations apply if there is an investigation already 
underway when such a request is received. If the existence of an 
investigation is not public the same procedure should be followed as 
outlined above.<p>

either during an investigation or at a trial. However, in certain 
extraordinary situations such as fugitives or in extradition cases, 
departmental personnel may confirm the identity of defendants or subject and 
the offense or offenses. Where a prior conviction is an element of the 
current charge, such as in the case of a felon in possession of a firearm, 
departmental personnel may confirm the identity of the defendant and the 
general nature of the prior charge where such information is part of the 
public record in the case at issue.<p>

defendant, or the refusal or failure of the accused to make a statement;<p>

examinations, ballistic tests, or forensic services, including DNA testing, 
or to the refusal by the defendant to submit to such tests or 
examinations;<p>

<li>Statements concerning the identity, testimony, or credibility of 
prospective witnesses;<p>

<li>Statements concerning evidence or argument in the case, whether or not 
it is anticipated that such evidence or argument will be used at trial;<p>

prevent the lawful efforts of the news media to photograph, tape, record or 
televise a sealed crime scene from outside the sealed perimeter.<p>

<a name="1-7.600B"></a>
<li>In order to promote the aims of law enforcement, including the 
deterrence of criminal conduct and the enhancement of public confidence, 
Department personnel with the prior approval of the appropriate United 
States Attorney may assist the news media in photographing, taping, 
recording or televising a law enforcement activity. The United States 
Attorney shall consider whether such assistance would:<p><ol> 

<li>Unreasonably endanger any individual;<p>

<li>Prejudice the rights of any party or other person; and<p> 

<li>Is not otherwise proscribed by law.<p></ol>

<li>A news release should contain a statement explaining that the charge is 
merely an accusation and that the defendant is presumed innocent until and 
unless proven guilty.<p> 

<li>In cases in which a search warrant or arrest warrant is to be executed, 
no advance information will be provided to the news media about actions to 
be taken by law enforcement personnel, nor shall media representatives be 
solicited or invited to be present. This prohibition will also apply to 
operations in preparation for the execution of warrants, and to any 
multi-agency action in which Department personnel participate.<p> 

<a name="1-7.600E"></a>
<li>Justice Department employees who obtain what may be evidence 
in any criminal or civil case or who make or obtain any photographic, sound 
or similar image thereof, in connection with a search or arrest warrant, may 
not disclose such material to the news media without the prior specific 
approval of the United States Attorney or Assistant Attorney General, who 
shall consider applicable regulations and policy, or upon a court order 
directing such production.<p></ol>

<dd>If news media representatives are present, Justice Department personnel 
may request them to withdraw voluntarily if their presence puts the 
operation or the safety of individuals in jeopardy. If the news media 
declines to withdraw, Department personnel should consider cancelling the 
action if that is a practical alternative.<p>

circumstances by the Office of Public Affairs.<p>
