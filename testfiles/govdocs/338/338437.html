            <p class="text">An important component of this National Council on
              Disability (NCD) project was the discussion of key project issues
              with federal policymakers, national researchers, and practitioners
              from across the United States. Information garnered from this process
              provided critical perspective about these issues related to the
              No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) and the Individuals with Disabilities
              Education Act (IDEA), students with disabilities, and the use of
              evidence-based research. NCD wishes to thank the following agencies

            <p class="centertext"><strong><font size="2"><a name="execsummary"></a>Executive
              Summary</font></strong></p>
            <p class="text">The educational landscape for students with disabilities
              is undergoing vast changes. Thanks to the Individuals with Disabilities
              Education Act (IDEA) and its push for increased access to education
              for students with disabilities, and the No Child Left Behind Act
              (NCLB), with its push for improved student outcomes, educators across
              the U.S. are reexamining their practices to find ways to close the
              achievement gaps between groups of students. Students with disabilities
              are a focus of this attention, as schools and states labor to improve
              their academic outcomes. Policymakers are studying both the reauthorization
              of IDEA and the ongoing implementation of NCLB to determine the
              most effective means for serving students with disabilities.</p>
            <p class="text">The National Council on Disability (NCD) commissioned
              this paper to assist policy leaders and stakeholders in identifying,
              disseminating, and aligning evidence-based outcome producing practices
              with the Federal Government's commitment to leaving no child behind
              in the attainment of a free appropriate public education. This paper
              is a precursor to a more detailed analysis that NCD will be conducting
              in coming months to provide additional input and recommendations
              to Congress and the Administration. NCD is an independent federal
              agency making recommendations to the President and Congress on issues
              affecting Americans with disabilities. NCD's overall purpose is
              to promote policies, programs, practices, and procedures that guarantee
              equal opportunity for all individuals with disabilities, regardless
              of the nature or severity of the disability; and to empower individuals
              with disabilities to achieve economic self-sufficiency, independent
              living, and inclusion and integration into all aspects of society.</p>
            <p class="text">NCD is particularly interested in how IDEA and NCLB
              are improving outcomes for students with disabilities and to what
              extent evidence-based practices are being used to make policy decisions
              affecting students with disabilities. The outcomes for students
              with disabilities in which NCD is most interested include:</p>
			  <blockquote>
            <p class="text">1) reducing the number/percentage of students with
              disabilities nation wide (currently at about thirty percent) who
              drop out of high school;<br>
              2) increasing the number/percentage of students with disabilities
              nation wide (currently at about 56 percent) who graduate high school
              with a diploma as opposed to a certificate of attendance; and<br>
              3) increasing the availability and usage of effective strategies
              to help students transition to and remain connected with postsecondary
              education.</p>
			  </blockquote>
            <p class="text">Data for this paper were gathered by conducting a
              literature review and a series of interviews with a panel of policymakers,
              researchers, and practitioners from across the country. The literature
              review included major databases, but unfortunately resulted in few
              evidence-based research studies for students with disabilities.
              The questions for the panel (See Appendix A) focused on the impact
              of NCLB on students with disabilities, alignment of NCLB and IDEA,
              and the use of evidence-based research in decision-making processes
              at the school and district levels.</p>
            <p class="text"> <span class="boldtext">Major Findings with Regard
              to NCLB and IDEA</span></p>
            <p class="text">This paper explores how attitudes and expectations
              for students with disabilities are changing as a result of NCLB
              and the impact of IDEA. Overall, there is strong support for increasing
              expectations for students with disabilities and helping them to
              improve their academic outcomes. At the same time, there is concern
              about how states and schools will manage this process, largely as
              a function of lack of knowledge of effective interventions and strategies.
              At times there appears to be some lack of will to undertake the
              difficult change, and fall back on excuses, but findings reveal
              a hope that these laws and policies will result in more equitable
              outcomes for students with disabilities.</p>
            <p class="text">Many respondents in our interviews indicated that
              the focus on closing the achievement gap for certain student groups,
              such as students with disabilities, was a very laudable and necessary
              goal. One of the main messages is to change the low expectations
              people have for students with disabilities.</p>
            <p class="text">Findings also show that there is a great deal of concern
              about how educators will respond to the possible poor performance
              by students with disabilities on standardized assessments and high
              stakes tests. The pressure to meet adequate yearly performance (AYP)
              and the use of high stakes tests to measure it is leaving states
              and districts with little time to think constructively how best
              to do that. Fears exist that high stakes tests may have a disproportionate
              impact on students with disabilities. &#8220;We're very concerned
              about the unintended consequences of holding schools accountable
              for [the disability] population. We're sensitive to the potential
              for pushing students out, for scapegoating students, for identifying
              these students as the reason that a school or a district isn't measuring
              up.&#8221; (Mitchell D. Chester, assistant superintendent for policy
              development in the Ohio education department, cited in Education
              Week, 2004b, p. 16). Unfortunately, at this time, there is no data
              to indicate whether high stakes tests will increase the rate of
              dropout by students with disabilities, but it certainly needs more
              study.</p>
            <p class="text">There are also concerns about how states and schools
              will handle measuring adequate yearly performance (AYP) for subgroups
              of students with disabilities and whether they can &#8220;game&#8221;
              the system by setting unrealistically high subgroup levels that
              most schools will not meet, and therefore won't have to report performance
              numbers. Others felt that a particular school could be punished
              for low scores in a subgroup, and administrators fear including
              students with disabilities.</p>
            <p class="text">One other concern expressed by several respondents
              is the limited focus on measuring academic skills because of the
              assessments required by NCLB. Particularly for students with disabilities,
              it is important to find ways to allow them to express their abilities
              in various ways, and they also benefit greatly from developing workplace
              competencies. </p>
            <p class="text">The role of school leadership and teacher qualifications
              was also explored. Not surprisingly, respondents noted that when
              school leaders had the vision and commitment to increase expectations
              for students with disabilities, the teachers and staff held similar
              views and were supported in their efforts to change teaching to
              help individualized needs students achieve. </p>
            <p class="text">A number of issues were raised regarding teachers.
              It was mentioned by several respondents that the push for highly
              qualified teachers is needed and that improved outcomes for students
              with disabilities should result from a better teaching force. But
              the logistical issues of finding and training those teachers is
              a difficult reality faced by schools. </p>
            <p class="text">The types of assessments and accommodations used for
              students with disabilities are also under review by school leaders.
              They are working to align assessment accommodations and instructional
              accommodations and align all of that with the standards &#8211;
              very time consuming and difficult work. Others saw value in more
              frequent assessments of students, saying &#8220;[A]ssessments are
              fundamental to education reform in this country, whether a regular
              assessment or high-stakes test. NCLB does not necessarily require
              a high-stakes test, it is an accountability test&#8212;not necessarily
              the same thing. It is forcing the question of how to test and assess.&#8221;
              But a final concern was expressed about the misuse of assessments,
              &#8220;If students with disabilities aren't accommodated or there
              aren't alternative assessments, school scores will be affected.
              If so, the school will figure out a creative way of counting these
              kids out or the kids will choose to leave.&#8221;</p>
            <span class="boldtext">Evidence-Based Research and Practice</span></p>
            <p class="text">This paper also provides a summary of relevant scientifically-based
              research, as well as a discussion of how such research is used by
              education practitioners and policymakers. Unfortunately, the amount
              of rigorous, evidence-based research on programs that promote positive
              outcomes for students with disabilities is severely limited. First,
              most research is aimed at young students and strategies to help
              them learn to read. Second, the few evaluations that are available
              usually involve a very limited number of students, sometimes fewer
              than a dozen, which makes drawing conclusions about a broader group
              very difficult. Third, most of the evaluations only focus on one
              type of disability (e.g. severe cognitive disability or learning
              disability), again making general applicability of findings difficult.
              And last, while a few scientifically rigorous studies of programs
              were identified, there were almost none in the area of dropout prevention,
              and only a few on the transition from secondary to postsecondary
              education. </p>
            <p class="text">According to the research that does exist, strategies
              that seem to be most effective in helping students with disabilities
              persist in high school typically include counseling services, reading
              remediation, tutoring, attendance monitoring, or after-school clubs
              (Lehr, Hansen, Sinclair, &amp; Christenson, 2003). Other services
              could include sustained and supportive monitoring interventions
              focused on school completion (Scanlon &amp; Mellard, 2002). An early
              1990s study of three dropout prevention programs for students with
              disabilities sponsored by the U.S. Department of Education found
              that five components were common to all programs: persistence, continuity
              and consistency; monitoring; relationships; affiliation; and problem-solving
              skills.</p>
            <p class="text">To help students with disabilities transition from
              secondary to postsecondary education, strategies that appear to
              be most successful include:</p>

            </ul>
            <p class="text">Even when there are evidence-based practices, practitioners,
              for various reasons, don't always end up using them. Two major barriers
              to the implementation of evidence-based practices are the lack of
              time and inadequate support from administrators. Other barriers
              include &#8220;pressures associated with high-stakes testing, insufficient
              materials, a mismatch between teacher style and the practice, a
              lack of fit between the practice and other methods mandated by the
              school district, and teachers' lack of in-depth understanding of
              the practice or forgetting&#8221; (p. 413). Practitioners need incentives
              and technical assistance in using evidence-based practices, yet
              little is done to help them learn to apply research to practice.</p>
            <p class="text">Comments were also made on the need to value the input
              by parents:</p>
            <blockquote class="text"> Which is more valid, the work of an evidence-based
              research center or the experiences of families of children with
              disabilities? What is the basis for the criteria? Someone's [research]
              numbers or someone's real life experience? For example, a school
              district got an evidence-based strategy from a university, but a
              parent suggested something else that they knew would work with their
              child. The strategies were polar opposites&#8230;There are parent
              groups organizing around what really works for their child. (Researcher)</blockquote>
            <p class="text">Not only is a stronger research base sorely needed,
              but researchers must work more closely with practitioners and parents
              to help them understand how to use research findings and to incorporate
              and value practical and parental knowledge. </p>
            <span class="boldtext">Conclusions and Recommendations</span></p>
            <p class="text">NCD recognizes that the bulk of change occurring in
              schools today is a result of NCLB's focus on accountability and
              outcomes. The change being brought about is very fundamental and
              deep, but also difficult, in that it involves changing attitudes,
              beliefs, and values about all young people being able to achieve
              to high standards. Another barrier to change has been the lack of
              evidence about what works, as well as the lack of disaggregated
              data. Fortunately, there are signs of positive change and evidence
              that holding students, including students with disabilities, to
              higher expectations results in improved outcomes, which leads to
              the first recommendation, which is &#8220;stay the course.&#8221;</p>
            <p class="text"><span class="red">Stay the Course.</span><span class="text">
              While some naysayers believe that NCLB sets too high a bar for students
              and schools, the vast majority of people believe that we must maintain
              high expectations for all students, particularly students with disabilities.
              </span> </p>
            <p class="text"><span class="red">Capacity Building.</span> In order
              to help school leaders and education practitioners provide the support
              to help every child succeed to higher expectations, they need assistance
              in learning strategies that are effective. Public investments should
              be carefully directed to professional and leadership development
              efforts that are tightly linked to the specific needs of each school
              or district and that address capacity issues related to teaching
              and learning and helping all students, particularly students with
              disabilities, reach high standards.</p>
            <p class="text"><span class="red">Highly Qualified Teachers.</span>
              Standards for highly qualified teachers should not be relaxed, although
              limited flexibility in reaching those standards, especially for
              rural schools, is appropriate. The U.S. Department of Education
              should conduct research and analysis on effective methods of teacher
              preparation, including alternative routes to certification, with
              a particular focus on special education. The higher education system
              also needs to find ways to prepare highly qualified teachers in
              routes unlike those we know of today.</p>
            <p class="text"><span class="red">Better Assessment Tools.</span>
              A host of needs calls for a new generation of assessments that are
              designed to serve a broader range of students with diverse needs,
              are useful to inform instruction, and that measure a broader range
              of skills. The U.S. Department of Education can play an important
              role in supporting research and development efforts to create a
              new generation of assessments that are appropriate for a large number
              of diverse students; measure more than academic skills; can be used
              as instructional management tools; and result in an increased number
              of students taking alternative assessments.</p>
            <p class="text"><span class="red">Support and Disseminate Evidence-Based
              Research and Practice.</span> It is clear that we need more rigorous
              research on effective strategies for older students with disabilities.
              Both IDEA and NCLB should support an enhanced research agenda and
              the U.S. Department of Education should bridge research efforts
              by the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services and
              the Institute of Education Sciences. Research is particularly needed
              to understand how to teach more academic rigor to students with
              disabilities and to understand optimal assessment tools.</p>
            <p class="text"><span class="red">Support for Students.</span> While
              research for students with disabilities is limited, a range of other
              research on high school reform points to strategies that are successful
              in improving student outcomes. The U.S. Department of Education
              should provide technical assistance on strategies to help students
              increase engagement in high school, reduce dropout rates, and increase
              preparation for postsecondary education and careers by: setting
              higher expectations, greater instructional personalization, self-advocacy,
              ongoing counseling and mentoring, parental involvement, and connections
              to the community and postsecondary learning options.</p>
            <p class="boldtext">Final Thoughts</p>
            <p class="text">The shift towards accountability, outcomes, and higher
              expectations in our schools is leading us in the right direction,
              although we recognize that schools face legitimate difficulties
              during this change process. But the response to these challenges
              should not be to back down on expectations for students with disabilities
              and those who have been perceived as unable to meet the standards.
              Policymakers and practitioners must remain committed to the goal
              of closing the achievement gap for all students. To lessen this
              commitment would be to return to the days and the mindset that only
              some students could reach, and deserved to be taught to, high standards.
              We now know that by setting high expectations, and helping students,
              teachers, administrators, and family members reach those high standards,
              we can close the achievement gap for all students.</p>
            <p class="centertext"><strong><font size="2"><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</font></strong></p>
            <p class="text">America is focused on educational reform like never
              before. The No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) has raised awareness
              of the poor performance of many of our schools and students, particularly
              those in disadvantaged and lower-income neighborhoods. Because the
              federal law now requires states, communities, and schools to collect
              data on student performance, broken out by categories of students
              based on their race and other factors, such as native language and
              disability, the public is finally beginning to understand the true
              magnitude of the problem. But a recent study indicates that despite
              our growing awareness and concern, we may have seriously underestimated
              the number of students who drop out of high school, revealing that
              the problem is greater than imagined (Swanson, 2004). </p>
            <p class="text">For many families with children in low-performing
              schools, or those who have children with individualized needs, the
              failure of our public schools to graduate every young person and
              prepare them for a career and livelihood comes as no surprise. Students
              with disabilities bear a particularly hard burden, as their rates
              of high school graduation, graduation with a diploma as opposed
              to a certificate of attendance, entry to postsecondary education,
              and success in the labor market are dramatically lower than rates
              for students without disabilities. More than 40 percent of secondary-aged
              students with disabilities do not attain a high school diploma at
              the end of high school, and dropout rates for youth with disabilities
              are three to four times higher than dropout rates for youth without
              disabilities. </p>
            <p class="text">The focus on school reform, particularly high school
              reform, is timely and much needed. NCLB is helping to shed light
              on which states and schools are doing the best job preparing their
              young people, including students with disabilities, for the challenges
              of further learning and economic self-sufficiency. While the public
              is more engaged in these discussions every day, there remains a
              lack of awareness of what works to help young people with educational
              challenges succeed. Old attitudes persist as well, and the reform
              process must change minds, values, and cultures so that we believe
              all students can achieve to the highest standards and that we adults
              are committed to helping them meet those standards in every way
              we know how. </p>
            <p class="text">The purpose of this research is to assist policy
            leaders and stakeholders in identifying, disseminating, and aligning
            evidence-based outcome producing practices with the Federal Government's
            commitment to leave no child behind in the attainment of a free appropriate
            public education. NCD expects that policy leaders and stakeholders
            will be able to use this research for a variety of purposes including
            to: identify existing federal resources being used (e.g., via NCLB
            and IDEA); identify new federal resources to develop, enhance, and
            sustain programs; determine whether existing resources are used effectively;
            improve alignment of resources, policies, and educational reform efforts;
            develop or modify policies and legislation to ensure the optimal use
            of resources; develop knowledge-utilization partnerships; analyze
            the impact of legislative changes on current resources; evaluate program
            effectiveness; and, accelerate changes in the nation's focus on leaving
            no child behind and improving educational results for all children.</p>
            <p class="text">The American Youth Policy Forum and the Educational
              Policy Institute were commissioned by the National Council on Disability
              (NCD) to review certain federal and state-level programs, strategies,
              and policies that enhance educational practices and improve valued
              outcomes for youth with disabilities. In particular, NCD sought
              better understanding of the early impact of the No Child Left Behind
              Act on students with disabilities, and its interaction with the
              Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). In addition,
              NCD was interested in learning to what extent evidence-based research
              is used by policymakers and practitioners to make policy, programmatic,
              and instructional decisions for youth with disabilities. </p>

            <p class="text">There were two components to this paper's research:
              a review of the literature and a series of interviews with policymakers,
              researchers, and practitioners from across the country.</p>
            <p class="red">Literature Reviews</p>
            <p class="text">Two literature reviews were conducted. The first was
              conducted as an environmental scan of issues related to high school
              graduation and transition for students with disabilities. The second
              focused on evidence-based practices related to students with disabilities.</p>
            <p class="text">Our review utilized a variety of search engines,
              including ERIC, HighBeam, and the NICI Virtual Library. We also
              reviewed dozens of websites related to students with disabilities,
              including the major sites of the U.S. Departments of Education and
              Labor. In the end, we reviewed 150 carefully selected research studies
              and articles, approximately 100 of which were used in this paper.
              With regard to evidence-based practices, our search focused on articles
              that (a) were published in a professional journal or by a professional
              organization; (b) contained information on a program or programs
              that curbed high school dropout, supported assessment and accommodations,
              and promoted transition; (c) contained outcome data related to the
              intervention; and (d) used some modicum of empirical rigor in evaluating
              the intervention (i.e., experimental and quasi-experimental designs;
              random controlled trials).</p>

            <p class="text">Most of the research evaluations we reviewed focused
              on one type of disability (e.g. severe cognitive disability or learning
              disability), making general applicability of the findings difficult.
              In addition, the majority of the research was conducted at the elementary
              school level, rather than at the secondary level. Although we reviewed
              many published studies in an effort to identify evidence-based practices,
              we were consistently disappointed in the lack of empirical studies
              available on these issues, particularly with regard to dropout prevention.
              Many articles reported research results, but the methodology was
              often extraordinarily limited. Examples include self-reported interviews
              as the primary indicator of program success. The incorporation of
              control groups into research design was almost negligible. It is
              likely that more studies exist that have a higher level of empirical
              soundness to them, but they are not easily searchable, identifiable,
              collectable, or applicable. As we discuss later, there are two major
              challenges associated with research on evidence-based practices
              in special education: the paucity of research with an acceptable
              level of empiricism; and the relatively poor dissemination of such
              research to those who can benefit from this information.</p>
            <p class="red">Interviews</p>
            <p class="text">For the interviews, a panel of 16 federal, state,
              and local policymakers, researchers, and practitioners from across
              the U.S. were invited to participate in this project. Participants
              were selected based on input from a variety of individuals and organizations.
              As a first round, we developed a list of 55 individuals from the
              literature and from our perception of who were leaders in the field.
              During the interviews, we asked panel respondents to suggest individuals
              who would be valuable to our review. In most cases, panel respondents
              supplied us with names that were already on our list. </p>
            <p class="text"> Panel respondents were guided through a series
            of questions developed for this project (see Appendix A: Interview
            Protocol on page 77). The questions were focused on the impact of
            NCLB on students with disabilities, the alignment of NCLB and IDEA,
            and the use of evidence-based research in decision-making processes
            at the school and district levels. All but one of the interviews were
            conducted by telephone. In several cases, participants were emailed
            follow-up questions to clarify their responses. Upon completion of
            the panel interviews, responses were collated and analyzed. </p>
            <p class="text">This paper is divided into three sections. Part I
              provides a discussion of numerous provisions of NCLB and IDEA that
              affect student outcomes, as well as comments and insights from the
              panel on implementation and alignment. Part II focuses on evidence-based
              research and practices issues (and the lack thereof) related to
              NCLB and IDEA requirements. Part III provides conclusions and recommendations
              for research and practice.</p>
            <p class="text">Appendices include the protocol used in interviewing
              the panel and a short synopsis of effective evidence-based programs
              and strategies. </p>

            <p class="text"><a name="educationact"></a><span class="boldtext">The
              Individuals with Disabilities Education Act</span></p>

            <p class="text">The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)
              is one component of a three-tiered federal approach to supporting
              individuals with disabilities. The other two federal Acts are the
              Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the Rehabilitation Act
              of 1973. Passed in 1975 as Public Law 94-142 and later given its
              current title, IDEA provides the foundation upon which students
              with disabilities are protected from discrimination and guaranteed
              to receive services designed to meet their special education and
              related services needs (American Youth Policy Forum &amp; Center
              on Education Policy, 2002). Prior to that, an estimated 6 million
              children and youth with disabilities were left on their own to garner
              educational services. IDEA requires states, districts, and schools
              to ensure that:</p>
            <ul>
              <li class="text">All children with disabilities ages 3 through 21
                receive a free, appropriate public education that meets their
                unique needs, regardless of the type or severity of their disability.</li>
              <li class="text">Children with disabilities be educated in the least
                restrictive environment possible, meaning that most students are
                to be taught in a general education&#8212;or regular&#8212;classroom.
                Districts and schools are responsible for providing whatever supplemental
                services or accommodations are necessary to fulfill this requirement.</li>
              <li class="text">Each student with a disability is to have an Individualized
                Education Program (IEP) that describes the education and related
                services to be provided to that student. The IEP is developed
                by a small committee consisting of parents, special education
                personnel, teachers, and school administrators. The 1997 reauthorization
                of IDEA required students aged 14 and older to sit on their own
                IEP committee.</li>
              <li class="text">Parents of students with disabilities have the
                right to notification, informed consent, due process, and involvement
                in key decisions about their child's eligibility, placement, IEPs,
                and other areas.</li>
              <li class="text">Federal grants are authorized to help pay state
                and local costs associated with implementing IDEA mandates and
                serving students with disabilities. (American Youth Policy Forum
                &amp; Center on Education Policy, 2002, p. 13)</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text">The 1997 reauthorization of IDEA provided the most
              significant amendments since the initial law was passed almost a
              quarter century earlier. Included in these amendments was an increased
              emphasis on student outcomes data, reduction of paperwork and procedural
              complexity, and a reduction or consolidation of separately-funded
              research, training, and support programs. (American Youth Policy
              Forum &amp; Center on Education Policy, 2002) The law also included
              a stronger focus on strategies to help students transition from
              high school to postsecondary education or a career, and the development
              of a transition plan as part of their IEP.</p>
            <p class="text">IDEA has been characterized as having fulfilled its
              primary goal of providing access for students with disabilities
              in public schools across America. In 1977, about eight percent of
              students were identified as having a disability and were receiving
              appropriate services. In 1999, 11 percent of all students were identified
              and served through IDEA (American Youth Policy Forum &amp; Center
              on Education Policy, 2002). In 1977, 80 percent of students with
              disabilities were placed in institutions or separate facilities
              where many received little schooling. By 1997-98, 96 percent of
              students with disabilities were served in regular public schools
              (U.S. Department of Education, 2003, p. ix). Even in the short time
              since the 1997 reauthorization of IDEA, the number of students served
              through IDEA has increased from 3.7 million to over 6.5 million.
              Additionally, students with disabilities are also spending more
              time in inclusive classrooms. In 1997-98, 46 percent of students
              with disabilities spent at least 80 percent of their academic day
              in a regular classroom, compared to 31 percent a decade earlier
              (American Youth Policy Forum &amp; Center on Education Policy, 2002,
              p. 20).</p>
              <p><a name="leftbehind"></a><span class="boldtext">The No Child Left
              Behind Act (NCLB)</span></p>

            <p class="text">On January 8, 2002, President Bush signed into law
              the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. The U.S. Department of Education
              touted the legislation as the &#8220;most sweeping reform of the
              Elementary and Secondary Education Act since its enactment in 1965&#8221;
              that &#8220;refines the federal role in K-12 education&#8221; (Pasternack,
              2003). In addition to those claims, NCLB champions accountability
              for &#8220;all students, including student groups based on poverty,
              race and ethnicity, disability and limited English proficiency.&#8221;
            </p>

            <p class="text">This legislative act contains four basic education
              reform principles:</p>
            <ul>
              <li class="text">stronger accountability for results;</li>
              <li class="text">increased flexibility and local control;</li>
              <li class="text">expanded options for parents; and</li>
              <li class="text">emphasis on teaching methods that have been proven
                to work. (National Center on Educational Outcomes, 2003).</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text">Through NCLB, states must implement statewide accountability
              systems covering all public schools and students based on:</p>
            <ul>
              <li class="text">Challenging state standards in reading and math
                (and science in 2005-2006);</li>
              <li class="text">Annual testing for all students in grades 3-8 and
                at least once in grades 10-12; and</li>
              <li class="text">Annual statewide progress objectives ensuring that
                all groups of students reach proficiency within 12 years (Pasternack,
                2003).</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text">According to the National Center on Educational Outcomes,
              the main difference between IDEA and NCLB is that the former specifically
              governs services that are provided to students with disabilities
              and provides individual accountability through IEPs developed on
              the basis of each child's unique needs. The National Center believes
              that NCLB complements the IDEA provisions by providing public accountability
              at the school, district, and state levels for all students with
              disabilities. Secondly, NCLB builds on IDEA law by requiring the
              participation of students with disabilities in state and district-wide
              assessments (National Center on Educational Outcomes, 2003).</p>
            <p class="text">In its analysis of NCLB, the National Center on Educational
              Outcomes cited three critical areas of focus for those who serve
              students with disabilities: (a) academic content standards, which
              tell us what students should learn; (b) academic achievement standards,
              which tell us how well they should learn; and (c) assessments, which
              tell us how well students achieved those standards (National Center
              on Educational Outcomes, 2003).</p>
            <p class="red">Adequate Yearly Progress</p>
            <p class="text">A key requirement of NCLB that has been praised by
              some but is the brunt of criticism from others is the calculation
              of &#8220;Adequate Yearly Progress&#8221; (AYP). According to the
              legislation, states must bring all students up to the &#8220;proficient&#8221;
              level on state tests by 2013-14, and individual schools must meet
              a measure of adequate yearly progress targets in mathematics and
              reading or language arts with all student groups from one year to
              the next (Education Week, 2004a). There are a number of disincentives
              for schools and states to meet these targets, but at issue with
              AYP is that all subgroups&#8212;including students with disabilities&#8212;must
              show progress. Of greatest importance is that a school will not
              meet AYP if any one of its subgroups fails to meet AYP. Schools
              and districts that fail to do so over time will be subject to &#8220;improvement,
              corrective action, and restructuring measures&#8221; (Pasternack,
              2003). A school can still make AYP if a subgroup does not make AYP,
              but only on the condition that the subgroup in question decreased
              in size by ten percent from the previous year's percentage AND manages
              to make progress on graduation rates or one other indicator designated
              by the state. Additionally, ninety-five percent of all students
              within a subgroup are required to take the assessment. Consequences
              for failing to meet AYP are as follows:</p>
            <blockquote class="text">If a school fails to meet its adequate yearly
              progress target for two consecutive years, then it is designated
              as a school in need of improvement. Parents of students in a school
              so designated will be given the option of sending their children
              to another school. Continued failure of a school to attain AYP targets
              beyond two years can result in more severe consequences, to include
              restructuring or changes in governance. There are many more details
              to the accountability requirements pertaining to such things as
              inclusion rules and various situations, such as schools meeting
              their targets but with not all subgroups meeting them. (Kahl, 2003)</blockquote>
            <p class="text">Concern exists among state and local officials about
              how students with disabilities&#8212;especially those with significant
              or multiple disabilities&#8212;are included in the overall school
              count. The issue raised by some is that it is unfair to include
              students with significant cognitive disabilities in the calculation
              of AYP. Given that approximately one percent of all students (or
              15 percent of students with disabilities) is considered severely
              disabled, the U.S. Department of Education offered an amendment
              to its guidelines in December 2003, now known as the &#8220;one
              percent rule.&#8221; This rule allows school districts to use alternative
              assessments (based on alternative standards) for up to one percent
              of all students to report either &#8220;proficient&#8221; or &#8220;advanced&#8221;
              in order to meet AYP (Goldstein, 2004). States are free to define
              which student groups or subgroups make up this one percent, but
              the policy is aimed at students with the most significant cognitive
              disabilities.</p>
            <p class="red"> Strong Public Support</p>
            <p class="text">Despite challenges, NCLB has generally commanded wide
              support from policymakers, educators, and parents. According to
              a recent Phi Delta Kappa/Gallup Poll, there appears to be strong
              public and private support for the principles behind NCLB (Gehring,
              2003). However, the survey also found that the public does not necessarily
              believe that a &#8220;test&#8221; is the best means to meet the
              goals of NCLB. Also, a recent survey by the Center on Education
              Policy (2004) found that an &#8220;overwhelming majority&#8221;
              (p. vi) of states agree with the basic premises of NCLB. Forty-two
              of the states surveyed agree that an accountability system based
              on content and performance standards would have a positive impact
              on student achievement, and seventy percent of states (33 of the
              47 responding) believe that NCLB accountability requirements will
              help to raise student achievement a great deal. However, district-based
              respondents were not as optimistic as their state counterparts&#8221;
              (Center on Education Policy, 2004, p. vi).</p>
            <p class="text">Of course, not all news is good news. A number of
              individuals and groups have very specific concerns. On January 8,
              2004, a group of Democratic Senators sent a letter to U.S. Secretary
              of Education Rod Paige criticizing the Administration for underfunding
              NCLB by &#8220;$7.5 billion.&#8221; Although the senators consider
              NCLB to be a landmark Act that &#8220;made a clear federal commitment
              to improve the education of millions of students across the country,&#8221;
              they suggest that the U.S. Department of Education has been remiss
              on providing appropriate and timely technical assistance and guidance
              to states, districts, and schools, and also criticize NCLB language
              that focuses on AYP but can allow at-risk students&#8212;including
              students with disabilities&#8212;to experience higher dropout rates
              (Kennedy et al., 2004).</p>
            <p class="text">The concern goes well beyond the halls of Congress.
              In state houses across the country, Democrat and Republican legislators
              are complaining about the burdens of NCLB's program. Utah and Virginia
              are examples of Republican-controlled states that are considering
              action against NCLB. Virginia's Republican-led House of Delegates
              overwhelming approved a resolution in January calling the No Child
              Left Behind Act &#8220;the most sweeping federal intrusion into
              state and local control of education in the history of the United
              States&#8221; (Hoff, 2004a).</p>
            <p class="text">However, one study released in January 2004 announced
              that states should already have adequate funding to meet the requirements
              of NCLB (Education Leaders Council, 2004), although not all state
              legislators concur with the findings of that report (Hoff, 2004b).
              Still, others indicate that it is a matter of using the money differently
              to achieve different outcomes. During our interviews in support
              of this project, a district-level administrator discussed the financial
              burden associated with keeping up with NCLB requirements. &#8220;Certainly
              NCLB has added cost to us&#8212;testing time, testing organization,
              communications with testing populations. These things cost real
              money.&#8221; However, others questioned whether NCLB is accurately
              depicted as an unfunded mandate.</p>
            <p class="text">The Center on Education Policy suggests that the Bush 
              Administration and Members of Congress have made &#8220;lofty promises&#8221; 
              for the success of NCLB and have underestimated the &#8220;magnitude 
              of change that must occur in American public education to bring 
              about those promises&#8221; (Center on Education Policy, 2003, p.

            <p class="text"><a name="alignment"></a><span class="boldtext">IDEA 
              Reauthorization and Alignment with NCLB</span></p>
            <p class="text">IDEA is currently in the process of reauthorization 
              by Congress. While no large, sweeping changes are expected, a consideration 
              during this round of amendments is how best to bring IDEA and NCLB 
              into greater alignment. We asked our panel whether they believed 
              that IDEA supports the goals of NCLB. As expected, the responses 
              were diverse. Some felt that the two were diametric opposites and 
              undermined each other, while a majority of our panel saw the two 
              pieces of legislation working together. &#8220;In NCLB, [student] 
              success is typically measured by a singular test score, where IDEA 
              is a bunch of different measures, whatever is determined through 
              the IEP and other policies.&#8221; Others disagreed: &#8220;I think 
              IDEA and NCLB are mutually exclusive. One is focused on the individual 
              and the other is focused on accountability&#8221; (District Administrator). 
              But even the &#8220;individual&#8221; nature of IDEA has some critics: 
              &#8220;The big unanticipated outcome of IDEA was that individual 
              accountability will bring [students with disabilities] up, but it 
              has hurt them by watering down the curriculum.&#8221; </p>
            <p class="text">In <em>Education Week's</em> recent <em>Quality Counts</em> 
              report on special education, a lawyer was quoted as saying that 
              the &#8220;individualized nature of IDEA is totally inconsistent 
              with the group nature of NCLB, even though they talk about classes 
              of kids who are disabled. To me, that's a collision course, to hold 
              a school responsible for Billy not reading at grade level, when 
              Billy has a disability whose need is individually met at a prekindergarten 
              level&#8221; (Lawyer Miriam K. Freedman, as cited in <em>Education 
              Week</em>, 2004b, p. 13). Conversely, a district-level administrator 
              saw IDEA and NCLB working in tandem:</p>
			  <blockquote>
            <p class="text">NCLB creates a system of accountability to support 
              IDEA. But IDEA is built on individualization where NCLB is a broad 
              requirement for groups. Schools and districts are having a difficult 
              time trying to bring these issues together&#8212;making the right 
              decision for each child but also making sure you meet the NCLB accountability 
              requirements.</p>
            <p class="text">Both pieces of legislation support the education of 
              students; the disconnect is the relative importance of how you go 
              about determining whether students are making progress. IDEA would 
              suggest that you do an assessment that is appropriate for the child 
              as determined by a committee. NCLB says you can do that as long 
              as you meet AYP. (District Administrator)</p></blockquote>
            <p class="text">One of our panel respondents suggested that the problem 
              isn't the legislative language, but the enforcement of the legislation. 
              &#8220;I think IDEA has been consistent with NCLB. The problem isn't 
              what's in IDEA, but rather, what has been enforced.&#8221; An example 
              was provided of the challenge of implementing the transition planning 
              that was part of IDEA &#8216;97. &#8220;In a lot of places, those 
              plans aren't there or are group manufactured. Thus, the problem 
              isn't IDEA&#8212;it's the implementation or enforcement of IDEA&#8221; 
              (Federal Policymaker).</p>
            <p class="text">A main element of the current reauthorization of IDEA 
              is to align the two bills. &#8220;They are trying to integrate them,&#8221; 
              said a researcher. &#8220;I think you will see pieces in the Senate 
              bill that try to reaffirm NCLB. A bigger question is how do you 
              do this? Everyone has gotten the new message that there is an attempted 
              alignment at the federal level. Aligned in two areas: programs for 
              students with disabilities will be aligned more closely with general 
              curriculum and content structures; and teacher development for special 
              education teachers will be more similar to that of regular teachers. 
              Practically, very few states can meet the teacher standards now, 
              let alone the changes that are expected. Most peoples' perception 
              of the requirement will jack up the percentage of teachers who are 
              unqualified.&#8221;</p>
            <p class="text">A federal administrator involved in the reauthorization 
              process thinks the two laws are being aligned in the current reauthorization. 
              &#8220;In the House and Senate bills there have been important changes 
              to align the two laws. The fight of 27 years ago&#8212;to get the 
              kids in the classroom&#8212;is largely over. It isn't a fight that 
              will ever be finished, but access is a given. Now, IDEA needs to 
              reflect more on what gets done for these kids. The debate has changed 
              to &#8216;What do you do with the child once he is there, not should 
              he be there.'&#8221;</p>
            <p class="text">Stated a representative of the National Institute 
              on Disability and Rehabilitation Research (NIDRR): &#8220;I've reviewed 
              it [IDEA] for the umpteenth time. With regard to inclusion, prevention, 
              etc., that's all the flavor of the mission of NCLB. I think the 
              hardest part the Administration is facing is how to interpret the 
              similarities to the public.&#8221; A special education researcher 
              noted: &#8220;The verbiage would say yes, that IDEA supports NCLB, 
              but to me it's backwards. NCLB should really support IDEA. The testing 
              seems to counterbalance the individualization of IDEA. Philosophically, 
              it sounds like the same, but when you get into it, it truly does 
              not support IDEA. Hopefully reauthorization will bring them together.&#8221; 
              A representative from a national organization commented: &#8220;Obviously, 
              the extent that the two can be mutually reinforcing, the better. 
              There will be some tweaks in IDEA to make that happen. I don't think 
              there are fundamental conflicts.&#8221;</p>
            <p class="text"><a name="perceivedimpact"></a><span class="boldtext">Perceived 
              Impact of NCLB on Students with Disabilities</span></p>
            <p class="text">Overall, there is a general sense that NCLB can have 
              and is already having a positive impact on most students with disabilities. 
              However, the true impact of NCLB will depend on a number of factors, 
              including the type of disability in question, how large the unintended 
              consequences are from implementation of the law, how much states, 
              districts and schools &#8220;game&#8221; the system, and how well 
              these same entities provide support for special education teachers 
              and paraprofessionals to meet the rigor required for adequate yearly 
              progress (AYP). </p>
            <p class="text">The Center on Education Policy (2004) found that most 
              states and districts were taking No Child Left Behind very seriously 
              and were working hard to meet the new federal requirements of AYP. 
              &#8220;NCLB is doing what federal laws tend to do best &#8212;focusing 
              the attention of a large, decentralized education system on the 
              same set of goals&#8221; (p. v). But the Center also found that 
              many school districts were having various difficulties enforcing 
              the law because of stringent or unworkable requirements.</p>
            <p class="red">Accountability</p>
            <p class="text">Although most of our respondents agreed that it is 
              too early to tell what impact NCLB will have when fully implemented, 
              most agreed that it has had an early impact on how people think 
              of issues related to accountability and students with disabilities. 
              By including all students in the calculation of AYP, educators must 
              concern themselves with the treatment and education of students 
              with disabilities. IDEA has been the main legislative instrument 
              to support the teaching and learning of students with disabilities, 
              but NCLB provides the accountability mechanism to supplement the 
              programs and regulations of IDEA. As one federal government director 
              suggested, &#8220;NCLB emphasizes the greater responsibility of 
              looking at what works in preventive interventions for students with 
              individualized needs. Because it is accountability based, it will 
              improve internal system changes.&#8221; A special education director 
              at the school district level remarked, &#8220;all students count 
              and all teachers count. Standards are raised and focus turns to 
              good instruction.&#8221; Another respondent added: &#8220;By forcing 
              states&#8212;for the first time&#8212;to include students with disabilities 
              in their assessment and accountability systems, we know that these 
              kids are going to count and progress is going to be measured.&#8221;</p>
            <p class="text">The perception among most individuals is that if expectations 
              and accountability rise, &#8220;phenomenal changes will occur.&#8221; 
              However, how people truly perceive the barriers to inclusion and 
              the education of students with disabilities could be the greatest 
              barrier of NCLB. </p>
			  <blockquote>
            <p class="text">&#8220;My philosophy is that the attitudinal barriers 
              are sometimes a bigger disability than the disability itself. This 
              is very much how I see NCLB. The major thing is to change the low 
              expectations people have toward students with disabilities. We've 
              already seen some of the impact. It's been pretty clear that there 
              has been a focus on students with disabilities that we have never 
              seen before. And in many cases, this is very good; in some not so 
              good. I've seen two kinds of reactions: oh my goodness, we see poor 
              performance, so what are we going to do to address this poor performance. 
              Other states have made very positive, pro-active responses to the 
              data they see. (Researcher)</p></blockquote>
            <p class="text">IDEA has largely been successful in getting students 
              with disabilities served. One respondent from a national organization 
              hopes that NCLB will enhance this achievement: &#8220;I hope that 
              the net effect will be that people will focus much less on making 
              sure students are served and much more on getting students with 
              disabilities to reach state standards. There will be a shift from 
              inputs and services to outcomes. I am cautiously optimistic.&#8221;</p>
            <p class="text">The term &#8220;cautiously optimistic&#8221; probably 
              best articulates the sentiments of most of the individuals interviewed 
              for this review. A major consideration is how states and districts 
              deal with this new layer of accountability. &#8220;We need to think 
              about these kids achieving at a high level. IDEA stopped short of 
              accountability. NCLB puts the accountability piece in. However, 
              how well the accountability piece is thought out is another issue.&#8221; 
              The AYP calculations have been a lightning rod of commentary in 
              newspapers around the country, putting schools, districts, and states 
              on the defensive. Because there is federal funding and control on 
              the line, the stakes are high if compliance is not met within the 
              federal guidelines. </p>
			  <blockquote>
            <p class="text">The stakes are so high, and subgroups are now so important 
              in calculation of AYP, there is little time for the states to think 
              constructively about how to go about that. States are trying to 
              look at a broad range of issues that impact students with disabilities 
              in AYP calculations, but localities are desperately trying to deal 
              with it now to meet the legislative requirements. States are trying 
              to provide guidance, but in terms of locals, the stakes are so high&#8212;you 
              are asking them to think broadly, but they are working with immediate 
              impact&#8212;immediate consequences. (Organizational Representative)</p></blockquote>
            <p class="text">Specifically, panel respondents pointed to a number 
              of issues where there has been a more immediate impact on students 
              with disabilities. Some of these areas include:</p>
            <p class="text"><span class="red">Academics.</span> Although there 
              is no data to account for the brief time since January 2002 and 
              this paper, there is belief that NCLB is partly responsible for 
              the academic progress of students with disabilities. A leading national 
              researcher on disabilities suggests that NCLB has improved reading, 
              math, and science learning and teaching. It has brought up the academic 
              progress of both good and bad schools. &#8220;It has not been universal, 
              but it has&#8212;on average&#8212;benefited schools.&#8221; </p>
            <p class="text"><span class="red">Data.</span> While the availability 
              of student-level data from schools, districts, and states has been 
              problematic in the general education field, it has been more problematic 
              for special education. Education Week found that only 13 of 37 states 
              providing data to its national survey &#8220;tested 95 percent or 
              more of their special education students in reading and mathematics 
              in grades, 4, 8, and 10, in the 2002-03 school year, or the most 
              recent year for which data were available&#8221; (Education Week, 
              2004b, p. 7). Additionally, nine states and the District of Columbia 
              could not provide any data (p. 13).</p>
            <p class="text">But this is better than it has been, and many believe 
              that NCLB is pushing districts and states to collect data for federal 
              reporting purposes. &#8220;One of the reasons we [national center] 
              got started is that there was no data on students with disabilities. 
              People were asking how they were doing on large-scale assessments, 
              and students with disabilities were not included. Now they are because 
              of NCLB. So now we have some data. We may not like it, but at least 
              have it.&#8221;</p>
            <p class="text">A representative of a national organization added: 
              &#8220;It's not what the law does, but what people do to implement 
              the law. I think NCLB will allow for collection of accurate data. 
              Never before have I seen accurate data; NCLB may make that happen. 
              Getting the data on the table will allow for a good discussion based 
              on data.&#8221; Stated a district-level representative: &#8220;Data 
              is horrific on the transition outcomes for students with disabilities, 
              so this is a great opportunity to get it done.&#8221;</p>
            <p class="text"><span class="red">Increased Dialogue/Knowledge of 
              Standards.</span> Whether one agrees or disagrees with NCLB, there 
              has been an undeniable increase in dialogue among educators, policymakers, 
              and researchers. Our panel respondents noted a renewed cooperation 
              between general education and special education teachers and more 
              joint programming and professional development. &#8220;I hear chief 
              state school officers talking about it now,&#8221; noted one researcher. 
              &#8220;It is a very different discussion these days.&#8221; Again, 
              much of this has happened because of AYP and the inclusion of students 
              with disabilities into the performance reporting for schools. </p>
            <p class="text">NCLB has come at a time when the awareness, use, and 
              support of academic standards are at their highest. Ninety percent 
              or more of states reported having the same mathematics and reading 
              content standards for students with and without disabilities (U.S. 
              Department of Education, 2003). &#8220;If I had asked teachers 10 
              years ago about standards, the comments would be much different; 
              today, people are certainly aware of what all kids are supposed 
              to learn,&#8221; stated a researcher. Studies in the mid-1990s substantiated 
              the belief that students with disabilities were being left out of 
              the standards process. Specifically, students with disabilities 
              were being excluded from participation in standards-based curricula 
              and assessments (Furney, Hasazi, Clark-Keefe, &amp; Hartnett, Fall, 
              2003). It appears that this is indeed changing because of NCLB, 
              but it is difficult to ascertain to what degree states and districts 
              are following the standards movement.</p>
            <p class="text">One panel respondent agreed that there has been a 
              general shifting of special education services to be more in line 
              with state standards due to NCLB, but warned that shifting and implementing 
              do not equal achievement:</p>
			  <blockquote>
            <p class="text">What supports do students need to achieve these standards 
              is an open question of what will happen. Most people are projecting 
              in 3-4 years that there is a good possibility that dropouts will 
              increase for special education students because there aren't supports. 
              There needs to be a reform of high school for students with disabilities. 
              A lot of places are facing a big gap in what will occur. High schools 
              have the kids in place who are a product of an older system; they 
              have come up through segregated programs not addressing state standards; 
              high school teachers are trying to address these standards, but 
              the discrepancies are so large, that the kids are falling out. They 
              are being babysat or not being supported to achieve standards at 
              all. This is the frustration that we are hearing all over the country. 
              (Researcher)</p></blockquote>
            <p class="text">Of course, the success of NCLB for students with disabilities 
              depends to some extent on which disabilities are included. It is 
              known that &#8220;disability&#8221; is a broad catchphrase that 
              captures mild learning difficulties, behavior difficulties, mental 
              retardation, and multiple disabilities. One researcher noted that 
              there is cross-disability diversity, as well as within-disability 
              diversity. &#8220;Within most disability categories, there are a 
              good number of kids with sufficient supports&#8212;they will do 
              all right. Many students are very close to being proficient in NCLB 
              terms, but others&#8212;those with multiple disabilities, autism, 
              mental retardation&#8212;have a long way to go. The story is much 
              different for these different groups.&#8221;</p>
            <p class="text">The impact, due in part to NCLB, also has a differential 
              effect depending on the performance of a given state or district 
              before the legislation was authorized. &#8220;We've seen large gains 
              in performance in those states that are proactive [with regard to 
              disability]. We've seen that kids are making improvements in performance.&#8221; 
              Not all respondents share this enthusiasm for what is transpiring. 
              &#8220;I think that the standards movement, as well as many policies

            <p class="red">Unintended Effects of NCLB</p>
            <p class="text">As with all laws, there are always unintended consequences. 
              &#8220;We're very concerned about the unintended consequences of 
              holding schools accountable for [the disability] population. We're 
              sensitive to the potential for pushing students out, for scapegoating 
              students, for identifying these students as the reason that a school 
              or a district isn't measuring up.&#8221; (Mitchell D. Chester, assistant 
              superintendent for policy development in the Ohio education department, 
              cited in Education Week, 2004b, p. 16). This perception was widely 
              held by our panel respondents. Several were worried about states 
              &#8220;gaming&#8221; the system:</p>
			  <blockquote>
            <p class="text">I have some real concerns about how the school districts 
              will translate the NCLB [provisions] about dealing with and reporting 
              the progress of students with disabilities. The anecdotal evidence 
              from earlier attempts to provide accountability (state mandated 
              proficiency testing) show significant abuses in many states&#8212;none 
              to the advantage of students with disabilities. If the future funding 
              of school districts is contingent on the right level of progress, 
              their response will be to not deal with the disability. (Practitioner)</blockquote>
            <p class="text">During our interviews, panel respondents discussed 
              unanticipated outcomes and malicious compliance. &#8220;Some students 
              with disabilities will do well on assessments and tests. But if 
              you take students with disabilities as a large group we start talking 
              about the potential of devastating effects. A particular school 
              will be punished for low scores in a sub-group, and administrators 
              fear including them.&#8221; Under NCLB, states must determine the 
              size of the subgroup populations that will be included in the measure 
              of average yearly progress (AYP), and it appears that some states 
              and districts are using the size determination to avoid measuring 
              certain categories of students. For example, respondents noted that 
              several states and districts seem to be artificially raising their 
              subgroup size to a level where there is little possibility that 
              the &#8220;subgroup&#8221; will ever be reached. An example was 
              given of a proactive district providing a reasonable level of 15 
              students per subgroup in a school. In this case, if a school has 
              only 10 students in a subgroup, their performance would not be included 
              in AYP calculations. However, if the school had 15 students or more 
              in that subgroup, their performance would be counted. We heard that 
              there are states that have artificially raised subgroup size to 
              100 or more, meaning there must be at least 100 students within 
              a subgroup to be considered in AYP, which, in the case of students 
              with disabilities and non-English language learners, might be unlikely. 
            </p>
			<blockquote>
            <p class="text">The worry is that, the way NCLB is structured with 
              subgroups, schools will work to keep the subgroup small enough as 
              not to be considered; they could start moving students around to 
              other buildings to keep under the limits. Let's say you have 60 
              students with disabilities in a typically-sized elementary school 
              (600 kids). In Minnesota, that school has to be accountable as a 
              subgroup, because they set a 15 person subgroup level per school. 
              In Texas, virtually no school will be included. (Researcher)</p>
			  </blockquote>
            <p class="text">According to respondents, states that are proactive 
              in dealing with disabilities are setting reasonable levels; those 
              that have not been proactive are setting very high subgroup levels. 
              There is a sentiment that AYP has created an unfair playing field 
              for states that have historically provided proactive legislation 
              and programs for students with disabilities and other subgroups.</p>
            <blockquote>
			<p class="text">Implementation of the law, in terms of the very high 
              stakes and consequences as disincentives to local administrators 
              and practitioners, will vary by locality. Many people are focused 
              on the consequences&#8212;to the extent that those who can manipulate 
              legislation will. It becomes an issue of &#8220;the letter versus 
              the intent of the law.&#8221; If we believe that other things have 
              to be put in place for those subgroups to truly achieve the dream, 
              then that will take a while. Otherwise, it will just be a legislative 
              issue and local implementers will do what they need to do but no 
              more. Those who have a deep conceptual belief will go further, but 
              those who do not will only meet the letter of the law. (Organization 
              Representative)</p>
			  </blockquote>
            <p class="text">There appear to be other ways for schools and states 
              to flaunt the intent of AYP. Regardless of the numerical count of 
              subgroup populations, school administrators may be under pressure 
              to remove students with disabilities, as they will be for other 
              subgroups, from their rosters. &#8220;Districts will find ways of 
              making students with disabilities ineligible for the pool; maybe 
              they'll say only students going for a [high school] diploma will 
              be considered, and move students to certificates. If this is left 
              as a loophole, this would be an area where schools will try and 
              play around.&#8221; A nationally-recognized researcher stated that 
              she saw districts that were worried about performance reports and 
              asked how they could get these kids out of their assessment system. 
              Additionally, a school administrator remarked that another unintended 
              consequence of NCLB is that as you improve the test scores of some 
              higher performing students with disabilities your overall score 
              may decrease because your best students do well enough that they 
              no longer are considered special education, leaving your remaining 
              pool with a lower standard.</p>
            <p class="text">AYP also has the unintended consequence of switching 
              the focus of assessments from work-based and alternative assessments 
              to more traditional forms of evaluation and testing. Research shows 
              that work-based learning opportunities provide a sound learning 
              platform for students with disabilities (Cobb, Lehmann, Tochterman, 
              &amp; Bomotti, 2000; Johnson, Stodden, Emanuel, &amp; Mack, 2002; 
              Stodden, 1998), but panel respondents see that these opportunities 
              may be lost through the focus on accountability and test outcome 
              measures: </p>
            <blockquote>
			<p class="text">Where I think NCLB is hurting is not as a piece of 
              legislation itself, but as a continuation of the standards and accountability 
              movement. I believe standards and accountability have done wonderful 
              things around the country, and I have talked to legislators and 
              practitioners who believe the same thing. However, what I think 
              has been, frankly, a disaster are two things: (1) the exclusion 
              of work-based programs from the original standards movement; and 
              (2) the almost myopic focus by researchers and policymakers and 
              bureaucrats at The U.S. Department of Education in using the results 
              of state-level high stakes tests as the only acceptable outcome 
              variable to measure the quality of educational interventions. We 
              do not need to sacrifice work-based learning if we want to increase 
              math literacy. I think that is a tragedy. (Researcher)</p>
			  </blockquote>
            <p class="text">Another panel member pointed similar criticism at 
              the law:</p>
			  <blockquote>
            <p class="text">Work-based experience is amongst the most important 
              aspects of keeping youth in school and to help them in future employment. 
              Research has shown that this is one of the most important predictors 
              of success of special education. Within NCLB, work-based learning 
              opportunities are becoming more difficult for schools to coordinate 
              for students due to the emphasis on standardized testing. This could 
              be a method of instruction that has gone to the past. Students with 
              disabilities could be dealt a major blow if this happens, unless 
              alternative assessments are encouraged and developed. And this is 
              true for every category of student. Whether in a resource room or 
              self-contained classroom, whether their label is mental retardation 
              or physical disability&#8212;research shows that all of these youth

              and administrators to want to keep students with disabilities in

            <p class="text">A representative of an educational non-profit suggested 
              that students with disabilities, like any other students, drop out 
              not because school is too hard, but rather, because it is too easy. 
              &#8220;Getting students to master skills needed in work and school 
              will help them and encourage them to stay in school&#8230;.I think 
              the bar has been raised for students with disabilities, and I think 
              they will meet it,&#8221; suggested a federal Rehabilitation Services 
              Administration (RSA) official. &#8220;However, if they don't get 
              the remedial help now, they will never get it.&#8221; Another federal 
              official thought that dropout rates could rise while states and

              tremendous benefit and reduce dropout rates.&#8221; </p>
            <p class="text">Although most of our respondents felt that some students

              disabilities and emotional disturbances who are not going to see 
              their way through the tests and they will get discouraged. These 
              kids may not get the type of services they actually need. If the 
              focus of the school becomes the test, then where is the focus? If

            <p class="text">Expulsion rates for students with disabilities is 
              another issue linked to the dropout problem. The 2003 Annual Report 
              to Congress on the Implementation of the Individuals with Disabilities 
              Education Act stated what is largely known in the research and policy 
              world: that the size of a district and the percentage of students 
              receiving free and reduced lunch were directly related to whether 
              schools used expulsion strategies for students with and without 
              disabilities. As the size of the school increased or as the percentage 
              of students on free and reduced lunch increased, so did the school's 
              use of expulsion for disciplining students with and without disabilities 
              (U.S. Department of Education, 2003, p. xvii). Some experts find 
              that a good number of expulsions occur not because of the behavioral 
              difficulties that students display, but rather, because of an effort 
              by schools and districts to rid themselves of problem students. 
              Stodden, Galloway, and Stodden (2003) posited that a real effect 
              of standards-based reform could be an increased dropout rate for 
              students with disabilities and a reduced rate of graduation. Such 
              an effect could manifest itself in a number of ways.</p>

            <p class="text">This is where we don't have any research, so it remains 
              to be seen. Intuitively, if there is no way of connecting students 
              to what they are learning, students are prone to drop out. If students 
              leave, schools don't have to deal with them. It saves the school 
              from the effort of accountability. So it isn't necessarily a bad 
              thing to force students out in some fashion. Either marginal performers 
              or labeled students will be forced out, or one better: the student

            <p class="text">While most teachers agree in principle that students 
              with disabilities should be taught to higher standards, a recent 
              survey by Education Week found that more than four in five teachers 
              reject the notion that students who receive special education services 
              should be held to the same standards and testing requirements as 
              other students their age. Nearly as many say that students who receive 
              special education services should be given alternative assessments 
              rather than be required to take the same tests as general education 
              students (Education Week, 2004b, p. 7). The survey also found that 
              while teachers are positive about how much their students who receive 
              special education services achieve each year, they also express 
              reservations about whether all students with disabilities can actually 
              meet state standards (Education Week, 2004b, p. 13).</p>
            <p class="text">These findings are particularly interesting in light 
              of the responses from our panel. As per other dialogues, our panel 
              vacillated on much of the discussion of expectations of students 
              with disabilities. One chord of agreement, however, was about expectations 
              for various types of disabilities. &#8220;I think that attitudes 
              about the potential of people with certain impairments, like sight, 
              for example, have changed over time and will continue to change 
              under NCLB. But students with cognitive disabilities and mental 
              illness&#8212;there hasn't been much change over the years with

            <p class="text">I think expectations for students with disabilities

            <p class="text">A researcher agreed: &#8220;Expectations are higher 
              than they used to be for students with disabilities, but I'm not 
              sure if that is because of NCLB or IDEA.&#8221;</p>
            <p class="text">Panel respondents seemed to agree that students with 
              learning disabilities have different abilities than those with significant 
              cognitive disabilities or than students whose disability impacts 
              their attitude. Whether students should be considered, depending 
              on their disability, at the same grade-level as other students is 
              open to discussion:</p>
			  <blockquote>
            <p class="text">If nothing else, NCLB has drawn a line in the sand; 
              you must bring kids up to snuff; a kid may know content, because 
              they have the auditory capacity, but reading is behind, thus they 
              do not test well. We must continue to accommodate that student until 
              we are testing what they actually know. Unfortunately, NCLB hasn't 
              been around long enough to demonstrate content knowledge as suggested, 
              and it isn't necessarily part of IDEA to test kids. (Federal Administrator)</p>
            <p class="text">I can't imagine that any logical person would think 
              you could bring everyone to the same performance level given they 
              come from different backgrounds and supports from home. However, 
              I do think that we should set standards for gains and moving kids 
              forward and moving them as far as we reasonably think they can go. 
              Value added. (Researcher)</p>
            <p class="text">I think there is no question that most school and 
              district educators expect considerably less from students with disabilities, 
              even when it goes beyond cognitive capacity. Expectations for students 
              with disabilities are the lowest&#8212;period. When I work with 
              these people, you get the &#8220;oh, OK, we might be able to do 
              this for poor and minority kids, but students with disabilities? 
              No way.&#8221; (Organization Representative)</p>
			  </blockquote>
            <p class="text">One researcher said that there is a belief among many 
              that students who are enrolled and not functioning well at one grade 
              level should be tested at a lower grade level. She suggested that 
              this reflected a lower-expectation for students, with the result 
              they fall further behind. But another panelist countered: &#8220;There 
              are some students with disabilities who will never be at grade level. 
              But through NCLB and IDEA, we are trying to show that students with 
              disabilities have their own strengths and weaknesses and we try 
              and work on those issues and meet whatever goals they set for themselves.&#8221; 
              It was noted that this differential expectation contains a Catch-22 
              of sorts: </p>
			  <blockquote>
            <p class="text">At some point, to say that they don't have to meet 
              the same standards suggests that there is some level of sorting 
              out. It is that sorting out function that has been the problem with 
              special education. If you are suggesting that there are alternate 
              standards, it really opens up a set of problems. We need to balance 
              it with individual needs. At what point do we keep the individual 
              nature of IDEA over the more &#8220;here is the standard&#8221; 
              of NCLB. Somewhere between the two is the answer. I don't think 
              the answer is suggesting that students with disabilities don't need 
              to meet the standard. There must be individual adaptation for students 
              with severe disabilities or behavioral modification that must be 
              addressed before you can meet standards. (Organization Representative)</p>
			  </blockquote>
            <p class="text">Making this acceptance of standards happen and turning 
              that into practice is difficult work. &#8220;Things need to change 
              early on&#8212;putting kids in general curriculum and making sure 
              supports are in place. The expectation has to be the same but the 
              approach must be different. You can make the same comment about 
              English as a Second Language or high-risk students. You have to 
              change the approach. If, at the local level, teachers can understand 
              that not every student will get there the same way, then they can 
              go about it. However, if educators can't conceptualize that, or 
              can't be adaptable, then they cannot begin to conceive how to teach 
              differently.&#8221;</p>
            <p class="text">Some panel respondents found that expectations varied 
              greatly for a number of other reasons. It was suggested that the 
              building principal has much to do with the attitude that teachers, 
              students, and parents have about students with disabilities. &#8220;Where 
              there is collaboration between teachers, this seems to happen [expectations 
              are higher]. Conversely, schools with principals overly concerned 
              with accountability tend to have special education teachers who 
              are less inclined and less confident working with general education 
              teachers. When these things are seen as punitive, there is a negative 
              view of students with disabilities because they are bringing down 
              the group.&#8221;</p>
            <p class="text">The truth is, these expectations vary from state-to-state, 
              district-to-district, and school-to-school. &#8220;We've heard from 
              people who say that students with disabilities can't learn, shouldn't 
              be expected to learn. But we've heard the opposite; my students 
              with disabilities are smarter than anyone else, it's just giving 
              them the tools to let them demonstrate it,&#8221; reported a federal 
              administrator. &#8220;In general, teachers should have the same 
              expectations of all their students. But specifically, it depends 
              on the specific students.&#8221;</p>
            <p class="text"><a name="development"></a><span class="boldtext"><font size="2"><strong>Professional 
              Development and Highly Qualified Teachers</strong></font></span></p>
            <p class="text">In addition to calling for high academic standards 
              (NCLB Section 1111), NCLB also calls for states to ensure a high-quality 
              teaching force in schools, high-quality professional development 
              activities, and high-quality curricula (NCLB Sections 1114 and 1115). 
              This is a challenge for public secondary and postsecondary education, 
              which is currently struggling through teacher shortages and quality 
              issues, to identify, attract, hire, develop and retain highly-qualified 
              teachers. The success of NCLB on students with disabilities is, 
              of course, dependent on teaching and learning in the classroom. 
              The level of professional development, teacher preparation, and 
              teacher induction will have an enormous effect on how well schools 
              and districts meet AYP for at-risk children.</p>
            <p class="text">At present, there are an estimated 39,000 special 
              education teachers responsible for the education of over 600,000 
              students with disabilities (Smith, McLeskey, Tyler, &amp; Saunders, 
              2002). According to Smith et al. (2002), many of these special education 
              professionals lack &#8220;the most basic preparation to do their 
              jobs&#8221; (p. 1). In terms of certification, it should be noted 
              that just 14 states and the District of Columbia require general 
              education teachers to complete one or more courses related to special 
              education to earn their licenses. This situation is of interest 
              because 76 percent of public school teachers teach students who 
              receive special education services (Education Week, 2004b, p. 7). 
              Still, national data illustrate that special education professionals 
              are, as a group, more highly experienced than general education 
              teachers. The average special education professional has taught 
              for 14.3 years, 12.3 years of which were spent teaching special 
              education. Over 90 percent of special education teachers were fully 
              certified for their main teaching assignment, a rate almost ten 
              percent higher than the national average for all educators. Fifty-nine 
              percent of special education teachers had a Master's degree, compared 
              to forty-nine percent of regular education teachers (U.S. Department 
              of Education, 2002b).</p>
            <p class="text">This is important, because, as a representative from 
              a national organization noted, &#8220;people are starting to understand, 
              in a concrete way, that a good teacher impacts schools' ability 
              to help students with disabilities. Special education teachers are 
              going to have more education and support. Under NCLB, only teachers 
              who are highly qualified in academic content areas will be allowed 
              to teach by 2005-06, although on March 15, 2004, the U.S. Department 
              of Education issued a ruling providing additional flexibility for 
              teachers in rural schools. NCLB has earmarked funds specifically 
              to address the critical and growing need for teacher training and 
              professional development. &#8220;Yet, supporting teachers in this 
              way must be done systematically if it is to succeed&#8221; (Stodden 
              et al., 2003, p. 14). But one researcher asked a more pointed question 
              that has been largely unanswered: &#8220;Do the special education 
              teachers know the standards related to NCLB?&#8221;</p>
            <p class="text">Several respondents noted the importance of attracting 
              highly qualified staff and ensuring that existing staff can meet 
              the certification and subject-area levels of expertise required 
              to meet state and federal requirements and ensure that all students 
              meet AYP. &#8220;I'm concerned with what NCLB will do with instruction 
              for students with disabilities. On one hand, I'm encouraged that 
              the focus will result in better teaching and learning. However, 
              I worry that we will not have sufficient numbers of qualified teachers 
              to meet that need.&#8221; Says a special education director,</p>
			  <blockquote>
            <p class="text">In a good way, you are going to have better prepared 
              and qualified teachers to meet the challenge. So, students with 
              disabilities will be instructed by more highly-qualified folks. 
              Of course, hiring and retaining these teachers is a challenge that 
              school districts will have to deal with, and incentives and other 
              programs will be important. This ultimately involves institutions 
              of higher education since they need to train these teachers. Can 
              they deliver? I don't know. (District Administrator)</p>
			  </blockquote>
            <p class="text">Trying to find qualified staff was an inherent problem 
              suggested by our panel. One district-based panel member noted that 
              the issue of certification and credentialing will have to change. 
              &#8220;In California, we have gone through a ton of credential changes 
              over the past five years, making it very difficult for teachers 
              to get certified in special education. It must be streamlined and 
              efficient, and it's not.&#8221;</p>
            <p class="text"><a name="standards"></a><span class="boldtext"><font size="2"><strong>Achievement 
              Standards</strong></font></span></p>
            <p class="text">Tightly linked to quality teaching and professional 
              development are the standards by which students with disabilities 
              are to be measured. Education Week reports that special education 
              teachers express &#8220;reservations about whether all children 
              with disabilities can actually meet state standards&#8221; (Education 
              Week, 2004b, p. 13). </p>
            <p class="text">Under NCLB, there are three guiding principles inherent 
              in federal law: (a) there will be challenging standards; (b) all 
              students, including students with disabilities, should have the 
              opportunity to achieve these standards; and (c) policymakers and 
              educators should be held publicly accountable for every student's 
              performance (Stodden et al., 2003). But standards are troublesome 
              by some accounts. The National Center on Secondary Education and 
              Transition's Capacity Building Institute (2001) found that there 
              are both positive and negative consequences to standards-based reforms 
              for students with disabilities. Positive consequences included:</p>
			  <ul>
              <li class="text">higher levels of learning and achievement toward 
                common standards; </li>
              <li class="text">increased access to general education curriculum; 
              </li>
              <li class="text">increased opportunities to learn grade-level material; 
                and </li>
              <li class="text">more meaningful diplomas because the students and 
                system are held accountable. </li>
			  </ul>
            <p class="text">Negative consequences included:</p>
			<ul>
              <li class="text">misinterpretation of achievement results and inappropriate 
                use of scores; </li>
              <li class="text">higher rates of failure and dropouts due to challenging 
                standards and inappropriate use of assessment data; </li>
              <li class="text">staff burnout and students cheating on tests; and 
              </li>
              <li><span class="text">schools becoming less inclusive of students 
                with disabilities because of test pressures and the probability 
                that too many students with disabilities would lower the accountability 
                index rating for the site (Quenemoen, Lehr, Thurlow, &amp; Massanari, 
                2001). </span> </li>
			  </ul>
            <p class="text">This stated, the U.S. Department of Education found 
              that ninety percent or more of the states reported having the same 
              math and reading content standards for students with and without 
              disabilities in 1999-2000, and ninety percent of students with disabilities 
              participated in statewide or districtwide assessments (U.S. Department 
              of Education, 2003, p. xvii). Still, Cobb, Lehmann, Tochterman, 
              and Bomotti (2000) suggest that the potential effects of current 
              standards-based reforms are &#8220;extremely worrisome, since&#8230;intentions 
              appear to be heavily weighted on the side of improvements for higher 
              ability students&#8221; (p. 16).</p>
            <p class="text">Several studies suggest that there is a lack of connection 
              among special and general education reform efforts (McDonnell, McLaughlin, 
              &amp; Morison, 1997) (McGrew, Thurlow, &amp; Spiegel, 1993) (McLaughlin, 
              Nolet, Rhim, &amp; Henderson, 1999). The studies illustrated that 
              many students with disabilities were being excluded from participation 
              in standards-based curricula and assessments and thus received minimal 
              or no benefit from reform efforts occurring in general education.

			<blockquote>
              <p class="text">Federal policy initiatives designed to address this 
                situation included the 1997 amendments to IDEA, which required 
                students with disabilities to have access to the general education 
                curriculum and state-mandated assessments; Goals 2000, which spoke 
                to the need to ensure high performance for all students; and the 
                No Child Left Behind Act, which emphasized the use of standards-based 
                measures to assess and improve student performance and provided 
                incentives and disincentives for schools failing to demonstrate 
                adequate progress with respect to the standards. (Furney, Hasazi,

			  </blockquote>
            <p class="text">Additional concerns about whether students with disabilities 
              can meet the standards include research that shows that students 
              with disabilities are negatively affected by traditional instructional 
              practices at the high school level (Gersten, 1998) (in Stodden et 
              al., 2003). Recent research efforts support the use of various instructional 
              supports for &#8220;promoting both the participation of students 
              with disabilities in the general education classrooms and their 
              attaining individualized learning objectives&#8221; (Stodden et 
              al., 2003, p. 13). Examples provided by Stodden et al. include revising 
              the curriculum, redirecting content-area planning, enhancing and 
              adapting content-area instruction and textbooks, engaging students 
              in peer tutoring, teaching students how to learn, curriculum modification 
              strategies, meta-cognitive approaches, learning strategies, and 
              the use of a graphic organizer.</p>
            <p class="text">And finally, Browder and Cooper-Duffy (2003) suggest 
              that, in spite of NCLB's focus on evidence-based practices, the 
              inclusion of &#8220;students with significant cognitive disabilities 
              in expectations for progress on states' academic content standards 
              appears to be a values-based, rather than an evidence-based, policy.&#8221;

            <p class="text"><a name="assessment"></a><span class="boldtext"><font size="2"><strong>Assessments 
              and Accommodations</strong></font></span></p>
            <p class="text">The 1997 reauthorization of IDEA and the more recent 
              NCLB require states to ensure that all students take part in large-scale 
              achievement testing, with or without the use of accommodations (U.S. 
              Congress, 1997, 2002). In its Interim Report on State and Local 
              Implementation of IDEA, the U.S. Department of Education found that 
              states and districts have met this challenge with respect to statewide 
              and districtwide assessments (U.S. Department of Education, 2003). 
              The report states that ninety-six percent of schools reported administering 
              a statewide assessment, of which ninety percent of students with 
              disabilities participated. Of that group, two thirds used an accommodation. 
              An additional three percent took an alternate test, and seven percent 
              of all students who received special education services did not 
              participate in any assessment. Two thirds (sixty-two percent) of 
              schools reported administering a districtwide assessment, with similar 
              participation rates as on statewide assessments (U.S. Department 
              of Education, 2003, p. ix).</p>
            <p class="text">With regard to the use of accommodations, the U.S. 
              Department of Education reported that states and districts allowed 
              widespread use of accommodations by students with disabilities to 
              participate in statewide assessments (U.S. Department of Education, 
              2003). Almost all states and districts (approximately ninety-four 
              percent or higher) allowed the use of presentation, setting, and 
              timing accommodations for students with disabilities. According 
              to Education Week's Quality Counts, &#8220;Every state&#8230;provides 
              at least one alternate assessment for students who received special 
              education services if they cannot take part in regular state tests 
              even with accommodations, or permits districts to do so&#8221; (Education 
              Week, 2004b, p. 7).</p>
            <p class="text">The most prevalent type of presentation accommodation 
              in use was reading test directions aloud (eighty-eight percent of 
              schools), and the use of accommodations did not appear to vary significantly 
              by type of disability, with the exception of students with sensory 
              impairments who had a greater reliance on Braille or large-print 
              editions of tests, magnifying or amplification equipment and tape-recorded 
              answers (U.S. Department of Education, 2003, p. xi).</p>
            <p class="text">Not only are the numbers of students with disabilities 
              taking large-scale tests increasing, but also their performance. 
              According to the National Center on Educational Outcomes, the performance 
              of students with disabilities on state assessments has increased 
              in over half of the states and remained stable in one-third of the 
              states (American Youth Policy Forum &amp; Center on Education Policy, 
              2002, p. 28).</p>
            <p class="text">Our panel of respondents had a number of comments 
              about accommodations and assessments. One researcher noted that 
              IDEA &#8216;97 required states to take assessments seriously, but 
              not until NCLB did they &#8220;really take it seriously.&#8221; 
              She added, &#8220;NCLB has pushed things forward, and everyone is 
              paying attention to it. Before, things were happening in only the 
              leading states. Now they're happening everywhere.&#8221;</p>
            <p class="text">The emphasis of IDEA and NCLB on achievement outcomes 
              has resulted in schools and districts increasing their efforts to 
              connect curriculum and assessments more intentionally with improved 
              outcomes. Thurlow (2002) reports that &#8220;most assessment guidelines 
              speak to the need for an alignment between assessment accommodations 
              and instructional accommodations&#8221; (p. 4). But as one of our 
              panel respondents said, not many are very far down this line. &#8220;There 
              are people who saw this issue as soon as NCLB came out, but getting 
              a critical mass of people to see this takes a while. They are starting 
              to recognize issues and working with states to deal with issues. 
              But again, it takes time, and people do not necessarily feel they 
              have the time&#8221; (Organization Representative).</p>
            <p class="text">Others cautioned that people shouldn't make the assumption 
              that accountability through NCLB automatically results in only high-stakes 
              tests. &#8220;Assessments are fundamental to education reform in 
              this country, whether a regular assessment or high-stakes test. 
              NCLB does not necessarily require a high-stakes test, it is an accountability 
              test&#8212;not necessarily the same thing. It is forcing the question 
              of how to test and assess&#8221; (Federal Administrator). &#8220;There 
              are no requirements for high-stakes tests,&#8221; said a representative 
              of a national organization:</p>
			  <blockquote>
            <p class="text">How will the required assessments affect students 
              with disabilities? By and large, we will be assessing students with 
              regular assessments, perhaps modified; secondly, because you need 
              to assess, you will be assessing students who weren't assessed before. 
              That should change because of NCLB. I am seeing the early stages 
              of people thinking of this issue differently at the district level. 
              I can't necessarily say that actions are any different, but the 
              thinking is progressing, which is a start. (Organization Representative)</p>

            <p class="text">A high-ranking federal official from the Social Security 
              Administration (SSA) said that &#8220;high-stakes tests&#8221; should 
              be used as a diagnostic instrument, and that it isn't fair to use 
              them as the end piece when students don't really know how best to 
              prepare for them. The problem of using these assessments for purposes 
              other than student development is a broad concern:</p>
			  <blockquote>
            <p class="text">This is a complicated issue. I think if you have a 
              test that measures absolute skills, you're trying to figure out 
              whether someone can read or add, I don't have a problem applying 
              it to everyone. On the other hand, if you are beginning to use results 
              to let people in and out of programs, then it becomes complicated. 
              If the tests are used for gathering information to rank schools 
              or exclude or include, then I have a problem. This is often missing 
              from the discussions. (Federal Administrator)</p>
			  </blockquote>
            <p class="text">Panel respondents continued to worry about malicious 
              intent issues with the law, especially with regard to accommodations 
              and accountability. &#8220;If students with disabilities aren't 
              accommodated or there aren't alternative assessments, school scores 
              will be affected. If so, the school will figure out a creative way 
              of counting these kids out or the kids will choose to leave&#8221; 
              (Researcher). He was skeptical of the true intent of some of America's 
              schools:</p>
			  <blockquote>
            <p class="text">Many schools are trying to hold special education 
              programs at arms length. One example from Delaware. One school, 
              when 8th grade students matriculate to the 9th grade. Instead of 
              putting them in high school (9th grade), they put them in a special 
              &#8220;9th grade academy&#8221; so their scores don't count. There 
              are several results. First, it segregates them from other students, 
              so there is no inclusion. Second, the students are forced to take 
              the 9th grade in high school over, thus they are now a grade behind. 
              For students, this then becomes a watershed&#8212;do I repeat the 
              grade because they made me, or do I drop out?</p>
			  </blockquote>
            <p class="text">Panel respondents also pointed out the non-malicious 
              types of outcomes. &#8220;I have a significant concern with grey-area 
              students&#8212;those who are not taking alternative assessments 
              but are not in the general curriculum/education. The students will 
              be taking the tests but not really in a plan of accommodation. Those 
              are the students who will potentially fall through the cracks&#8221; 
              (Organization Representative). That panel member also pointed out 
              her concern for the implications of spending time on testing. &#8220;Time 
              spent on test preparation will take away from traditional time spent 
              on transitioning issues. Some places are thinking about how to do 
              this, but there are a number of places that are simply not doing 
              it.&#8221;</p>
            <p class="text">Another panelist reiterated what we know from the 
              research literature. &#8220;We are all over the place in terms of 
              how to accommodate students with disabilities, even within districts. 
              What guidelines are schools and districts using to make these decisions? 
              Guidelines need to deal with how students are accommodated and how 
              much time students get for testing&#8221; (Federal Administrator). 
            </p>
            <p class="text">And one researcher voiced a concern common in the 
              area of psychometrics: </p>
			  <blockquote>
            <p class="text">My general sense is that we should see a blip in scores 
              (we've already seen a blip in participation in state tests, just 
              by requiring it) because previously students weren't focusing on 
              academic content; now they are, so the scores should elevate. But 
              once beyond the blip, how do you maintain? How do you get the level 
              of supports necessary? Can schools maintain that support? (Researcher)</p>
			  </blockquote>
            <p class="text">The most recent issue with regard to assessments and 
              accommodations in NCLB revolves around the &#8220;one percent&#8221; 
              issue. In December 2003, the U.S. Department of Education outlined 
              its final rule regarding the calculation of Average Yearly Progress 
              (AYP) for students with disabilities. The rule allows states to 
              &#8220;develop and use alternate achievement standards for students 
              with the most significant cognitive disabilities for the purpose 
              of determining the AYP of states, local education agencies, and 
              schools&#8221; (U.S. Department of Education, December 9, 2003). 
              An alternate achievement standard is an expectation of performance 
              that differs in complexity from a grade-level achievement standard. 
              An alternative assessment is an assessment designed for the small 
              number of students with disabilities who are unable to participate 
              in the regular state assessment, even with appropriate accommodations. 
              Examples of alternative assessment may include teacher observation, 
              samples of students' work, and standardized performance tasks. In 
              brief, the rule provides flexibility to states, districts, and schools 
              to use, in the calculation of AYP, alternative assessments that 
              score at the &#8220;proficient&#8221; and &#8220;advanced&#8221; 
              level for students with disabilities, with a cap of one percent 
              of all students. The Secretary of Education reserved the right to 
              approve an exception for a specified period of time for a state, 
              and the one percent cap does not pertain to individual schools to 
              allow for flexibility, but only to districts and states. This rule 
              took effect January 9, 2004 and will guide schools and districts 
              and states for the current (2003-04) academic year.</p>
            <p class="centertext"><strong><font size="2">Part II - Evidence-Based 
              Research and Practice</font></strong></p>
            <p class="text">An important component of No Child Left Behind is 
              the focus on evidence-based practices. The U.S. Department of Education 
              has moved toward a research-driven mandate supported by practices 
              that rely extensively on random controlled trials (RCTs) and other 
              high-end research methodology to inform policy and practice. The 
              importance of this movement was illustrated by the retooling of 
              the former Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI) 
              into the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) in late 2002. </p>
            <p class="text">The impetus for the move toward evidence-based research 
              and practices emanates from the Department of Educations's belief 
              that educational research is often poorly constructed:</p>
			  <blockquote>
            <p class="text">The field of K-12 education contains a vast array 
              of educational interventions &#8211; such as reading and math curricula, 
              schoolwide reform programs, after-school programs, and new educational 
              technologies &#8211; that claim to be able to improve educational 
              outcomes and, in many cases, to be supported by evidence. This evidence 
              often consists of poorly-designed and/or advocacy-driven studies. 
              (Institute of Education Sciences, 2003, p. iii)</p>
			  </blockquote>
            <p class="text">According to Davies (1999), evidence-based policy 
              &#8220;helps people make well-informed decisions about policies, 
              programs and projects by putting the best available evidence from 
              research at the heart of policy development and implementation.&#8221; 
              IES uses the criteria set by the Campbell Collaboration, an international 
              effort to promote and make available systematic reviews of research 
              studies. </p>
            <p class="text">Simply put, evidence-based research should be &#8220;systematically 
              searched, critically appraised, and rigorously analyzed according 
              to explicit and transparent criteria&#8221; (Davies, 2004, p. 7). 
              The purpose is to produce information that will have enough rigor 
              to appropriately inform the development of public policy and high 
              quality programs.</p>
            <p class="text">As stated, NCLB requires evidence-based research and 
              practices to be used in the field. In fact, NCLB includes more than 
              100 references to &#8220;scientifically-based research&#8221; (Browder 
              &amp; Cooper-Duffy, 2003). States receiving NCLB funding and providing 
              subgrants to local educational agencies (schools or districts) must 
              use the funding:</p>

            <p class="text">The use of evidence-based practices in special education 
              is a new initiative, largely due to language authorized during the 
              1997 reauthorization of IDEA. Practitioners often have difficulty 
              finding practices that are based on rigorous evaluation methods, 
              either through the use of random controlled trials or other experimental 
              methods. In an analysis of research-based instructional practices 
              for students with disabilities, Gersten, Chard, and Baker (2000) 
              were able to locate only one empirical study, which happened to 
              be a Klingner, Vaughn, Hughes, and Arguelles (1999) study of reading 
              approaches in the classroom. According to Gersten et al. (2000), 
              research on special education has largely been &#8220;in the form 
              of self-reflective essays&#8221; (p. 445).</p>
            <p class="text">Lehr et al. (2003) reported on an integrative review 
              of published reports of dropout intervention outcomes. Out of more 
              than 300 studies, 45 intervention studies were coded, and effect 
              sizes were calculated for 17 studies. Not one study incorporated 
              a random selection process; 24 percent (only 11 students) used non-random 
              procedures for selection but random assignment of participants to 
              control and experimental groups; and 38 percent (17 students) assigned 
              participants to control groups without random assignment. Only four 
              studies (10 percent) utilized pre- and post-test controls. Another 
              limitation of the research, according to the analysis by Lehr et 
              al., is that only 9 of the 45 coded studies had some form of randomized 
              design, of which 6 were focused on the high school population. Only 
              two of those studies were conducted after 1994. The authors concluded 
              that the greatest limitation of this review was that the status 
              of the research base did not lend itself to conducting a meta-analysis, 
              resulting in a &#8220;significant need for more rigorous research

              ten percent of these articles focused on cognitive/academic skills,

            <p class="text">Dropout rates among students with disabilities have 
              always been a serious challenge for educators, parents, and policymakers. 
              Even though there have been positive decreases in the percentage 
              of students dropping out of high school, one third of all students 
              with disabilities drop out (American Youth Policy Forum &amp; Center

              than half of students with disabilities graduate from high school 
              (see Figure 1). An additional eleven percent of students graduate 
              with a certificate (U.S. Department of Education, 2002a).</p>

            <p class="text">A problem with the dropout rate is the lack of up-to-date 
              and accurate data on educational progress with respect to students 
              with disabilities. The U.S. Department of Education (2003) reported 
              to Congress that fewer states and schools reported on the dropout 
              rates of students with disabilities than on the dropout rates of 
              general education students, and only eighteen percent of states 
              reported rates separately for students with disabilities and general 
              education students (p. xii).</p>
            <p class="text">Students with disabilities, like other students, drop 
              out for a wide variety of reasons. According to Jordan, Lara, and 
              McPartland (1996), these reasons can be categorized as those that 
              push or pull students out of school. Push factors are usually considered 
              the primary reasons for dropping out, and include repeating grades, 
              low academic achievement, and insufficient evidence that school 
              personnel care (Scanlon &amp; Mellard, 2002). Factors that pull 
              students out of school may include employment and pregnancy. </p>
            <p class="text">Dropout prevention strategies for students with disabilities 
              typically include counseling services, reading remediation, tutoring, 
              attendance monitoring, or after-school clubs (Lehr et al., 2003). 
              Other services could include sustained and supportive monitoring 
              interventions focused on school completion (Scanlon &amp; Mellard, 
              2002). An early 1990's study of three dropout prevention programs 
              for students with disabilities sponsored by the Office of Special 
              Education Programs found that five components were common to all 
              programs: persistence, continuity and consistency; monitoring; relationships; 
              affiliation; and problem-solving skills (Lehr et al., 2003).</p>
            <p class="text">Other researchers support these component areas, but 
              warn about the efficacy of recent research. &#8220;The extent to 
              which these interventions are systematically targeted for disengaged 
              learners is unclear and closer examination suggests many of these 
              practices are not evidence-based and have not been subjected to 
              rigorous evaluation&#8221; (Lehr et al., 2003).</p>
            <p class="red">Evidence-based dropout strategies</p>
            <p class="text">The research literature on effective dropout strategies 
              is extraordinarily limited. While there appears to be an abundance 
              of anecdotal evidence of success of programs and strategies, only 
              a marginal number have an empirical basis for that success. As presented 
              previously, Lehr et al. (2003) recently conducted a meta-analysis 
              of dropout research, only to find that of the 300 studies they reviewed, 
              only forty-five studies could be coded, and only nine had some form 
              of randomized design. In the end, only two conducted since 1994 
              were focused on high school students and had a randomized-control 
              element in the evaluation. </p>
            <p class="text">However, we were able to identify information on a 
              few dropout programs for students with disabilities. Sinclair, Christenson, 
              Evelo, and Hurley (1998) conducted an evaluation of &#8220;Check 
              and Connect,&#8221; a dropout prevention and intervention procedure 
              developed to encourage middle school youth at high risk for dropping 
              out to remain engaged in school and on track to graduate (See Appendix 
              B: Evidence-Based Practices). Central to Check and Connect is a 
              system &#8220;monitor&#8221; to keep students, parents, and teachers 
              focused on the educational goals. Interventions included the sharing 
              of information with students about the monitoring system, providing 
              feedback to students about their progress, regularly discussing 
              the importance of staying in school, and conducting risk-factor 
              problem-solving sessions.</p>
            <p class="text">Ninety-four students were randomly assigned to a treatment 
              or control group (n=47 each). Analysis found that students who received 
              the Check and Connect intervention were more likely to still be 
              enrolled after one year in the program (ninety-one percent vs. seventy 
              percent) and more likely to graduate from high school within four 
              years (forty-six percent vs. twenty percent). </p>
            <p class="text">The PASSAGEWAY (Program to Assist Secondary Students 
              in Achieving Gainful Employment for West Alabama Youth) Program 
              was designed to help at-risk special education students who either 
              were potential dropouts or already had dropped out get back on track 
              (Madison, Marson, &amp; Reese, 1999). The program worked with students 
              in six Alabama counties, providing literacy and employment training, 
              employment opportunities, flexible scheduling, and family counseling. 
              Services were provided by trained professionals, graduate students, 
              and industry partners. Students were divided into two strands: strand 
              one was defined for incoming ninth, tenth, and eleventh grade students 
              identified as at-risk of dropping out; strand two was defined for 
              students with disabilities who had dropped out four years prior 
              to entry into PASSAGEWAY. Although the research article suggests 
              that there were no strand one dropouts in three years of operation, 
              and that half of the strand two (disability dropouts) had gained 
              employment, there is no empirical evidence of success. </p>
            <p class="text">We reviewed several other programs that similarly 
              were limited in their outcome data and analysis. For instance, the 
              Transition Services Program of the Onondaga-Cortland-Madison Board 
              of Cooperative Educational Services (New York), which serves students 
              aged 13-21, most with mental retardation, serious emotional disturbance, 
              specific learning disabilities, and multiple disabilities, claims 
              to be &#8220;instrumental in reducing the dropout rate of at-risk 
              students by increasing their awareness of opportunities available 
              to them with training and a diploma.&#8221; Unfortunately, no evidenced-based 
              data were available to support that statement.</p>
            <p class="text"><a name="transition"></a><span class="boldtext">Evidence-Based 
              Practices in Transition</span></p>
            <p class="text">Transition from high school to postsecondary education 
              and the workforce is a critical issue for students with disabilities, 
              such that specific language was added to IDEA in 1997 to ensure 
              that all students, by age 14 or earlier, would have a statement 
              of transition services itemized in their IEP. In addition, IDEA 
              also requires school districts to include students as participants 
              in their transition planning meetings (Field &amp; Hoffman, 2002). 
              Regardless of the legislative language, research shows that the 
              implementation of this policy has been slow and inconsistent across 
              states (Hasazi, Furney, &amp; DeStefano, 1999; Johnson, Sharpe, 
              &amp; Stodden, 2000; Johnson et al., 2002; National Council on Disability, 
              2000). </p>
            <p class="text">Fifty-seven percent of youth served under IDEA received 
              a standard diploma and an additional eleven percent received an 
              alternative credential when they left high school in 2000-2001 (U.S. 
              General Accounting Office, 2003). In total, over 300,000 IDEA youth 
              exited high school that year. Approximately thirty-seven percent 
              of students with disabilities entered some type of postsecondary 
              education (compared to seventy-eight percent for all high school 
              graduates) (Blackorby &amp; Wagner, 1996). Overall, an estimated 
              428,280 students with disabilities were enrolled in colleges in 
              the United States in 1997-1998, almost half of whom were diagnosed 
              as learning disabled (Skinner &amp; Lindstrom, 2003).</p>
            <p class="text">At the postsecondary level, the number of students 
              reporting a disability has increased dramatically, climbing from 
              less than three percent in 1978 to nearly nineteen percent in 1996 
              (Blackorby &amp; Wagner, 1996). To meet the needs of the students, 
              there has been a ninety percent increase in the number of postsecondary 
              programs offering opportunities for adults with disabilities to 
              continue their education (Pierangelo &amp; Crane, 1997). Nonetheless, 
              the enrollment rate of people with disabilities in postsecondary 
              institutions is still fifty percent lower than that of the general 
              population, which has significant effects on the long-term employment 
              prospects for people with disabilities (Stodden &amp; Dowrick, 2000). 
              It is hoped that an outcome of NCLB will be an increase in the number 
              of students with disabilities who are prepared to pursue postsecondary 
              education.</p>
            <p class="text">Education and training after high school is becoming 
              more important for all students, especially for students with disabilities. 
              Recent changes in the labor market have increased the importance 
              of postsecondary education as a factor in the job market, and postsecondary 
              education provides the opportunity for students to maximize their 
              preparedness for future job market trends (Stodden &amp; Dowrick, 
              2000). But according to Stodden and Dowrick, adults with disabilities 
              are negatively and disproportionately affected by changes in general 
              employment trends. They, unfortunately, face labor market liabilities 
              which place them in the position of being the &#8220;last-hired 
              and the first-fired&#8221; (Stodden &amp; Dowrick, 2000).</p>

            <p class="text">In 1996, U.S. Census Bureau statistics indicated labor

              currently participate in today's labor force. However, this participation 
              doubles to 30 percent for those who have completed high school, 
              triples to 45 percent for those with some postsecondary education 
              and climbs to 50 percent for adults with disabilities and at least 
              four years of college (Stodden &amp; Dowrick, 2000).</p>

            <p class="text">Still, significant numbers of students with disabilities 
              remain in special education programs beyond their eighteenth birthday 
              while their non-disabled peers go on to postsecondary education 
              or the workforce. According to Hart, Zaft, and Zimbrich (2001), 
              reasons for this discrepancy include:</p>
			  <ul>
            <li class="text">federal entitlements to public educational 
              services that continue to age 21 (with most recent legislation through 
              the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act Amendment, 1997);</li>
            <li class="text">low expectations that students with significant 
              disabilities such as mental retardation will go on to college; and 
            </li>
            <li class="text">adult service agencies with limited resources 
              and long waiting lists. </li>
			  </ul>
            <p class="text">The U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO)(2003) recently 
              reported that students with disabilities have a &#8220;fear&#8221; 
              of losing public assistance, per the first bullet above. An unintended 
              consequence of Social Security Administration (SSA) programs and 
              regulations is the potential discontinuation of benefits once a 
              student leaves high school and enters postsecondary education. In 
              fact, the SSA &#8220;Ticket to Work&#8221; program, which serves 
              individuals with disabilities (Title II of the Social Security Act) 
              between the ages of 18 and 64, has reported serving less than one 
              percent of eligible youth. GAO visited three states and was told 
              by SSA officials, school administrators, teachers, advocacy groups, 
              and others that fear of losing federal and state benefits is a significant 
              barrier to participation in federal work incentive programs such 
              as the Ticket to Work program. SSA has recently partnered with the 
              U.S. Department of Education to reverse those policies and allow 
              students in postsecondary education to continue to receive benefits.</p>
            <p class="text">A senior administrator with SSA on our panel described 
              it this way:</p>
			  <blockquote>
            <p class="text">Under the 1997 amendments to SSA, we are required 
              to reevaluate the one million individuals under the age of 18 who 
              receive Supplemental Security Income (SSI) services upon their 18th 
              birthday, and apply adult eligibility. The result is that 30 percent 
              of these kids are not eligible for Ticket to Work and other SSI 
              services. What's been happening is that students have apparently 
              been dropping out in order to keep their SSI and Medicaid services. 
              Together with the Department of Education, we are about to issue 
              a rule this spring which reverses incentives: if you are on SSI, 
              and enrolled in school, and have an IEP, then we will delay the 
              eligibility ruling. If you want to be certain that your child continues 
              to receive benefits, then we have now made it that keeping them 
              in school is the best thing, not the other way around. The prior 
              rule evidently was a disincentive to stay in school. (Federal Administrator)</p>

            <p class="text">Financial aid is another barrier to postsecondary 
              studies for students with disabilities. The Youth Advisory Committee 
              of the National Council on Disability concluded that disabilities 
              may prevent students from accessing financial aid for college and 
              graduate school, because of &#8220;reduced course loads, extended 
              number of semesters before the completion of a degree, difficulty 
              with test taking and scholarship essay writing, an inability to 
              participate in college work-study programs due to the nature of 
              a disability, and discrimination against graduate school assistants 
              with disabilities&#8221; (Youth Advisory Committee of the National 
              Council on Disability, 2003).</p>
            <p class="text">In its study, the GAO <strong>(2003) identified the 
              problems reported by various stakeholders in the transition process</strong> 
              (see Table 2 below). As is evident in the table, each constituency 
              had a different viewpoint. Students noted a lack of self-advocacy 
              training, which helps empower them to develop the necessary skills 
              to succeed in a postsecondary environment. Parents found that lack 
              of information and support made it difficult to navigate the transitional 
              period. Teachers and other educators talked about the problems in 
              linking students with postsecondary and workforce opportunities 
              and services. Researchers focused on the lack of work-based experiences 
              for students, a notion we found mirrored by the researchers on our 
              panel. And finally, government officials focused on the more tangible 
              issue of transportation for students with disabilities. All are 
              legitimate barriers to the successful transition of students, and 
              all have their own set of difficulties in moving toward acceptable 
              and appropriate remedies. </p>

            <p class="text">In a synthesis of special education literature, Skinner 
              and Lindstrom (2003) identified six critical areas where students 
              with disabilities are at a disadvantage compared to non-disabled 
              students with regard to postsecondary education attainment:</p>
			  <ul>
            <li class="text">deficits in study skills such as test preparation, 
              note-taking, and listening comprehension;</li>
            <li class="text">problems with organizational skills;</li>
            <li class="text">difficulties with social interaction;</li>
            <li class="text">deficits in specific academic areas, with 
              reading and written composition being the most frequent;</li>
            <li class="text">low self-esteem; and </li>
            <li class="text"> higher school dropout rates.</li>
			</ul>
            <p class="text">If these are the main challenges to transitioning 
              to postsecondary life for students with disabilities, what policies 
              and programs can remedy or ameliorate these challenges? To inform 
              our discussion, we identified a taxonomy, developed jointly by Western 
              Michigan University and the Transition Research Institute at the 
              University of Illinois, of transition practices for students with 
              disabilities (ERIC Clearinghouse on Disabilities and Gifted Education, 
              2000). Based on an exhaustive review of the literature and reviews 
              of model projects and exemplary programs, the findings were organized 
              into the following five categories:</p>
			  <ul>
            <li class="text">Student-focused planning;</li>
            <li class="text">Student development;</li>
            <li class="text">Interagency and interdisciplinary collaboration;</li>
            <li class="text">Family involvement; and </li>
            <li class="text">Program structure and attributes.</li>
			</ul>
            <p class="text">The director of the study said they found that effective 
              transition relied on &#8220;more than a special education teacher 
              or a transition specialist to implement these practices&#8212;it 
              takes the entire school community&#8221; (ERIC Clearinghouse on 
              Disabilities and Gifted Education, 2000).</p>
            <p class="text">Skinner and Lindstrom (2003) identified the following 
              factors that have shown empirical evidence in influencing success. 
              These include: (a) the extent of student knowledge of the nature 
              of their disability and compensatory strategies; (b) how able a 
              student is to manage a disability in a proactive manner (e.g., self-advocacy, 
              goal setting, knowledge of disability law, selection of an appropriate 
              college, self-identification, organizing for living and learning, 
              etc.); (c) the availability of emotional and academic support; (d) 
              the severity of the disability (e.g., a diagnosis of Attention Deficit 
              Disorder compared to learning disabilities); (e) strength of the 
              student's motivation; and (f) how willing he or she is to persevere 
              under adverse conditions.</p>
            <p class="red">Evidence-Based Transition Strategies</p>
            <p class="text">What practices work in transition? Unfortunately, 
              the evidence-based research in this area is limited. In addition, 
              the difficulty in targeting interventions during the complex period 
              of adolescence has steered researchers away from high school and 
              transition issues. It is difficult to determine which specific intervention 
              at the secondary education level is responsible for an outcome, 
              given the many inputs (adolescent development, curriculum, impact 
              of peers, high school structure, teacher quality, etc.) Because 
              of many of these complexities, research will likely continue to 
              focus in the short term on early education and reading, leaving 
              a void in research for secondary school students with disabilities, 
              and transition.</p>
            <p class="text">A secondary limitation to the research literature 
              is the small size of studies. To provide an example within the transition 
              arena, Serebreni, Rumrill, Mullins, and Gordon (1993) looked at 
              the implementation and effectiveness of Project Excel, a six-week 
              summer transition program designed to (a) facilitate the transition 
              to college for incoming students with disabilities, and (b) promote 
              academic excellence for high-achieving students with disabilities 
              at the University of Arkansas. Program activities were clustered 
              into three categories: psychosocial adjustment, academic development, 
              and university and community orientation.</p>
            <p class="text">According to Serebreni et al. (1993), students who 
              participated in Project Excel received academic advising and personal 
              counseling, and six hours of college credit, and participated in 
              a wide range of social and recreational activities. On a post-program 
              Likert scale evaluation questionnaire, students rated Project Excel 
              as a good-to-excellent college preparatory experience. The study's 
              authors concluded that Project Excel enabled students to &#8220;develop 
              friendships, successfully complete two college courses, and acquaint 
              themselves with the university and surrounding community&#8221; 
              (Serebreni et al., 1993). We use this example to show that, while 
              Project Excel and other programs like it may be good models, it 
              is difficult to make that assumption from this study due to obvious 
              limitations, most specifically empirical rigor. The number of students 
              included in the study was only 12. There are other examples of similarly-challenged 
              studies where the sample size is&#8212;at best&#8212;limited. </p>
            <p class="text">This stated, there are still &#8220;pockets&#8221; 
              of information, some evidence-based, that are worthy of discussion. 
              For instance, Benz, Lindstrom, and Yovanoff (2000) reviewed the 
              research on transition factors associated with secondary and postsecondary 
              outcomes for students with disabilities. Their search yielded six 
              programmatic factors that resulted in better opportunities for students 
              with disabilities:</p>
			  <ul>
            <li class="text">Participation in paid work experience in 
              the community during the last two years of high school;</li>

            <li class="text">functional academic skills (e.g., reading, math, 
              writing, and problem-solving); </li>
            <li class="text">community living skills (e.g., money management, 
              community access); </li>
            <li class="text">personal-social skills (e.g., getting along with 
              others); </li>
            <li class="text">vocational skills (e.g., career awareness, job search); 
              and </li>
            <li class="text">self-determination skills (e.g., self-advocacy, 
              goal setting);</li>
			  </ul>
            <li class="text">Participation in transition planning;</li>
            <li class="text">Participation in vocational education classes 
              during the last two years of high school, especially classes that 
              offer occupationally-specific instruction;</li>

            <li class="text">Absence of continuing instructional needs 
              in functional academic, vocational, and personal-social areas after 
              leaving school. (Benz et al., 2000)</li>
			  </ul>
            <p class="text">Hart, Zafft, and Zimbrich (2001) implemented and evaluated 
              a model approach for creating access to college for all students, 
              including students with disabilities who have a significant physical 
              or mental impairment. The model, supported through an Office of 
              Special Education Programs grant, was built around a student's strengths 
              and preferences, involved family members, and used a collaborative 
              interagency team (Student Support Team) to create innovative strategies 
              that support student access to inclusive college settings. A consortium 
              of five urban high schools and their local college was created with 
              the primary purpose of improving adult outcomes for students with 
              significant disabilities. The project used a student-centered framework 
              and modeled many of the &#8220;best practices&#8221; outlined by 
              the National Transition Alliance. </p>
            <p class="text">The development of a Student Support Team (SST) at 
              each high school was at the core of the model. The SST included 
              college faculty, parents, students, and disability professionals, 
              and its role was to develop individual services and supports for 
              students who expressed an interest in pursuing postsecondary education. 
              The SST met monthly to identify individual services and supports 
              for participants, aged 17 - 22, with significant disabilities. Each 
              SST developed a sample menu of individualized services and supports, 
              some of which included academic coaching, transportation training, 
              career connections to employment, mentoring, technology, and social 
              networks (Hart et al., 2001).</p>
            <p class="text">Hart et al. (2001) found that several (no numbers 
              provided) of the 25 high school students with significant disabilities 
              who were served through the project completed high school and continued 
              to take courses at their local college. Others worked part-time 
              and took a course, while still others worked in areas related to 
              their preferences and college experiences. Students expanded their 
              social networks to include peers without disabilities, and reported 
              a greater sense of pride in themselves. As part of the project, 
              a check-list was created to identify the essential skills or activities 
              that each student needed to accomplish (see list below). </p>

            <p class="text">In 1989, the Marriott Foundation, with assistance 
              from TransCen, Inc., initiated a program to enhance employment opportunity 
              for youth with disabilities called &#8220;Bridges . . . From School 
              to Work&#8221; (Marriott Foundation, 2004). The program was developed 
              to address the traditionally high unemployment rate of youth with 
              disabilities as they exit high school by providing them with critical 
              job experience, and to help employers meet their human resources 
              needs. The unique aspect of &#8220;Bridges&#8221; was paid internships 
              for youth with disabilities during their last year of high school. 
              Students are placed in internships in local companies where the 
              employer pays the intern directly. </p>
            <p class="text">In addition to the more than 6,000 youth who have 
              benefited from this program to date, eighty-four percent of youth 
              placed in employment successfully completed the program and eighty-nine 
              percent of them received offers of ongoing employment. A follow-up 
              study completed 24 months after program completion found that, on 
              average, fifty-seven percent of the students remained employed with 
              an eleven percent increase in wages and a twenty-four percent increase 
              in hours worked per week. Nineteen percent of the students were 
              unemployed but pursuing further education (Marriott Foundation, 
              2004). </p>
            <p class="text">The success of the Bridges program underscores the 
              importance of paid work experience as an adjunct to high school 
              curricula for youth, regardless of disability category or severity 
              of disability. The Bridges program is particularly interesting because 
              one of our panel respondents was involved in the evaluation of the 
              program. This respondent reiterated the success of the program, 
              but also worried that this type of program&#8212;an evidence-based 
              practice that illustrated real results in workplace preparation&#8212;would 
              be lost in an NCLB world of academic accountability measures.</p>
            <p class="text">Other challenges found by the National Center on Secondary 
              Education and Transition (NCSET) is that school administrators, 
              teachers, staff, students, and community members do not necessarily 
              believe that all students can achieve to high standards, that supports 
              in high school do not adequately take into account the complexity 
              of the transition process, and that students aren't actively involved 
              in their transition planning. To help demonstrate to teachers and 
              staff what types of quality interventions are most successful, NCSET 
              developed the following chart that compares standard and quality

            <p class="boldtext">Evidence-Based Research on Assessments and Accommodations 
            </p>
            <p class="text">The lack of empirical evidence on accommodations and 
              assessments for students with disabilities is discouraging. &#8220;Regrettably, 
              there is virtually no current research regarding the differential 
              effects that various accommodation services, supports and programs 
              have in relation to postsecondary education access, participation 
              and long-term outcomes such as student retention, graduation rates 
              and high quality employment opportunities&#8221; (Stodden &amp; 
              Dowrick, 2000; Tindel, Heath, Hollenbeck, Almond, &amp; Harniss, 
              1998). Thurlow, Ysseldyke, and Silverstein (1995) suggest that part 
              of the reason for this dearth of evidence was the limitation in 
              making testing accommodations available prior to the reauthorization 
              of IDEA.</p>
            <p class="text">Schulte, Elliott, and Kratochwill (2001) noted that, 
              when selected and implemented appropriately, testing accommodations 
              are believed to lead to technically sound test results. &#8220;Yet, 
              to date there is limited experimental evidence to support this assertion&#8221; 
              (Schulte et al., 2001). In their study of the effects of testing 
              accommodations on the mathematics test scores of a sample of 86 
              fourth-grade students, including 43 students with disabilities, 
              Schulte et al. found that not all students benefited from testing 
              accommodations. &#8220;In fact, approximately one third of students 
              with and without disabilities in this study actually had lower scores 
              in the accommodated condition than the non-accommodated condition&#8221; 
              (Schulte et al., 2001). Furthermore, a report of results from a 
              similar research project indicated that fourteen percent of students 
              with disabilities and eight percent of students without disabilities 
              experienced a negative effect of testing accommodations (Elliott, 
              Kratochwill, &amp; McKevitt, 2001). The researchers did not have 
              any special explanation for why students had negative results, but 
              called for more research.</p>
            <p class="text">Helwig and Tindal (2003) conducted a randomly assigned 
              study of the efficacy of teachers assigning accommodations to students 
              for a mathematics achievement test with 973 general education and 
              245 students who received special education services at the elementary 
              and middle school levels. The accommodation in question was reading 
              aloud instructions and questions to students during the assessment. 
              Summary findings indicated that teachers were unsuccessful at predicting 
              which students would benefit from the accommodation, thus casting 
              serious doubt on the assignment process. The authors found that 
              prior studies resulted in similar outcomes (Fuchs, Fuchs, Eaton, 
              Hamlett, &amp; Karns, 2000; Weston, 1999), with the exception of 
              Fuchs et al., who found that the efficacy of assignment could be 
              increased if teachers had prior accommodation and testing information. 
            </p>
            <p class="text">Helwig and Tindal (2003) concluded that their study 
              confirmed prior research that found that teachers are not accurate 
              in their assignment of accommodations. However, they cautioned:</p>
			  <blockquote>
            <p class="text">The importance of accommodation decisions for students 
              in special education remains, considering the need for validity 
              in testing and federal mandates to include all students in large-scale 
              testing programs. Because teachers are the individuals working closest 
              with students, and possessing the greatest knowledge of each student's 
              capabilities, it is the job of researchers to develop methods to 
              increase teacher efficiency rather than to bypass them in the decision-making 
              chain. ( p. 223)</p>
			  </blockquote>
            <p class="text">The authors also caution that their findings should 
              not discourage teachers from assigning a reading accommodation. 
              Teachers and IEP team members should &#8220;rely on their knowledge 
              of students' reading and mathematics achievement, learning styles, 
              classroom experiences, and testing behaviors.&#8221; (Helwig &amp; 
              Tindal, 2003, p. 224)</p>
            <p class="text">While research on testing and accommodations for students 
              with disabilities is very limited, emerging practices may help shed 
              some light on how schools and school districts can improve outcomes 
              for students. The Charlotte-Mecklenburg, NC school district asked 
              all special education teachers to review the placement of students 
              with disabilities in alternative assessments to determine if they 
              could take standard assessments. Following a complete review, the 
              school district discovered that 27 percent of the students who had 
              been directed to take alternative assessments were successful in 
              taking the regular assessment (some with accommodations). The district 
              assistant superintendent indicated that they were able to make these 
              determinations because teachers use student assessment data on a 
              regular basis (in some cases, every six to seven days) to manage 
              their instruction and learning (Testimony of Jane Ryne, Assistant 
              Superintendent Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools, Charlotte, NC before 
              the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Education and the 
              Workforce, Washington, DC, March 3, 2004). </p>
            <p class="red">Turning research into practice for students with disabilities</p>
            <p class="text">According to Klingner, Ahwee, Pilonieta, and Menendez 
              (2003), two barriers to the implementation of evidence-based practices 
              are (a) a lack of time and (b) inadequate support from administrators. 
              Other barriers include &#8220;pressures associated with high-stakes 
              testing, insufficient materials, a mismatch between teacher style 
              and the practice, a lack of fit between the practice and other methods 
              mandated by the school district, and teachers' lack of in-depth 
              understanding of the practice or forgetting&#8221; (p. 413).</p>
            <p class="text">From a teaching and learning perspective, there are 
              many factors that impact the use of evidence-based research in the 
              planning and implementation of proven practices in the classroom. 
              Sparks (1988) found that teacher beliefs, self-efficacy, attitudes, 
              and perceptions all had an impact on whether and to what degree 
              a teacher tried new strategies. Additionally, teachers who face 
              challenges during the implementation of evidence-based practices 
              will often revert to their traditional, comfortable practices (Lieberman, 
              2000). As Gersten, Chard, and Baker (2000) note, &#8220;Even when 
              there is an awareness of the existing knowledge base, sustaining 
              implementation in classrooms is infinitely more complicated than 
              telling teachers and others that there is a knowledge base on effective 
              practices and they should be using it.&#8221; Davies (2004) reports 
              that moving research into practice &#8220;repeatedly shows that 
              practitioners need incentives to use evidence and to do things that 
              have been shown to be effective&#8221; (p. 20).</p>
            <p class="text">Through their review of the extant literature, Klingner 
              et al. (2003) identified the following ways that researchers overcome 
              the burdens of implementation:</p>
			  <ul>
            <li class="text">actively recruiting teachers and schools;</li>
            <li class="text">demonstrating both the general value of the 
              practice and its potential for improving student performance on 
              high-stakes tests;</li>
            <li class="text">assuring the feasibility and fit of the practice 
              in the classroom;</li>
            <li class="text">developing an ongoing reciprocal partnership 
              with school personnel;</li>
            <li class="text">providing teachers with sufficient mentoring 
              and feedback;</li>
            <li class="text">maintaining open lines of communication; 
              and </li>
            <li class="text">providing materials and other resources. 
              (Klingner et al., 2003, p. 413)</li>
			  </ul>
            <p class="text">A federal administrator on our 
              panel suggested that researchers don't know how to push their research. 
              &#8220;If you want to change behavior, you have to reach them where 
              they are&#8212;parents at the grocery stores, teachers through the 
              National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers. 
              We must get smarter about getting messages on research.&#8221; </p>
            <p class="text">Turkstra (2003), using a medical model, fires off 
              a warning about being too tied down by evidence-based practices 
              (EBP):</p>
			  <blockquote>
			  <p class="text">The potential danger of focusing on EBP is that it 
              leads to a disproportionate emphasis on the tools of the experimental 
              design rather than the specific questions that need to be answered. 
              Evaluations and recommendations for clinical practice should not 
              be based only on the amount of random controlled trials or other 
              evidence but also on reasoned assessments of the problems inherent 
              in attributing treatment cause to experimental effect; the degree 
              of generalizability; and the scientific, social, and ethical implications 
              of a decision in favor of or against assessing a cause to an effect. 
              Also, such evaluations and recommendations should not discount the 
              role of reasoned judgments made by experienced clinicians. </p>
			  </blockquote>
            <p class="text">Turkstra (2003) adds that &#8220;statistically significant&#8221; 
              is not synonymous with &#8220;clinically meaningful,&#8221; that 
              judgment is always required in individual cases, and random controlled 
              trials may be impractical or inappropriate for answering many research 
              questions. One of our panel respondents reiterated this issue: </p>
			  <blockquote>
            <p class="text">I believe that the Institute of Education Sciences 
              and the U.S. Department of Education, in the promotion of evidence-based 
              research, could be straightforward to the field in its knowledge 
              that quasi-experimental designs only answer some types of research 
              questions and other types of designs are essential to answering 
              other types of questions. (Researcher)</span></p>
            <p class="text">I think districts think they are using evidence-based 
              research to inform practice, and the best districts are, but I do 
              think it is hit or miss. They actually do it serendipitously, through 
              colleagues, hearing someone speak, by following people. And it is 
              also by how easily information can be accessed, not necessarily 
              the quality. The marketing of it is often more important. We don't 
              necessarily find that the best quality evidence has the best quality 
              distribution and marketing. So, the big need in our field falls 
              on the backs of the regional technical assistance centers in special 
              education. They need to filter the well-done studies from less well-done 
              studies and promote the use of evidence-based practices as they 
              go out and work with districts. (Researcher)</p>

              with disabilities. &#8220;The research-based list from the federal 
              level is based on ideology, not necessarily the quality of research. 
              You have researchers arguing about whether it is a functional methodology 
              or not or whether it is a good research methodology. The difference 
              now is that the federal government has taken sides. This is a difficulty 
              for us.&#8221; He adds, &#8220;I don't think there are any barriers 
              other than absence of knowledge and absence of research. Having 
              it accessible; being able to understand it. I think we've been moving 
              in that direction.&#8221;</p>
            <p class="text">One researcher suggested that there is a potential 
              collision ahead with regard to evidence-based practices and local 
              decision making:</p>
			  <blockquote>
            <p class="text">Which is more valid, the work of an evidence-based 
              research center or the experiences of families of children with 
              disabilities? This has arisen several times. What is the basis for 
              the criteria? Someone's [research] numbers or someone's real life 
              experience? For example, a school district got an evidence-based 
              strategy from a university, but a parent suggested something else 
              that they knew would work with their child. The strategies were 
              polar opposites. No one wants to touch this, especially those who 
              defend NCLB. There are parent groups organizing around what really 
              works for their child. Someone is going to have to address this. 
              (Researcher)</p>
			  </blockquote>
            <p class="text">Practitioners and researchers on our panel were asked 
              how they made district-level decisions on classroom strategies for 
              students with disabilities. The strategies varied considerably. 
              One school district was very constructive in its approach to research 
              and program adoption. &#8220;When we adopted Open Court , we researched, 
              read, talked to teachers, and visited school districts. Same with 
              Language! [another literacy program]. We had people basically convince 
              us that it was the way to go. We did due diligence.&#8221; Once 
              through adoption, they didn't stop there. &#8220;We actually used 
              control groups to see how the program worked. Open Court was full 
              hog&#8212;everyone did it&#8212;but we conducted correlation studies 
              to prove its worth. We did test-matrix methodologies to see what 
              areas in state assessments students weren't performing, and then 
              mapped the curriculum backward to Open Court to place a focus on 
              those issues.&#8221;</p>
            <p class="text">Another school district relied on its disability committee. 
              &#8220;We have been looking at research-based programs. We look 
              at the validity of these programs, their norms, so we are adopting 
              something that isn't just packaged and is aligned with standards. 
              This isn't new. We've always done this. Last summer we had a pilot 
              program using a new reading program to see how well it worked.&#8221;</p>
            <p class="text">Researchers weren't entirely convinced that practice 
              was sufficiently informed by evidence-based research. &#8220;They 
              are definitely not using evidence-based research,&#8221; said one 
              researcher. &#8220;It has more to do with accountability than what 
              works, and most of the teaching is teaching to the test.&#8221;</p>
            <p class="red">Removing barriers to adoption of evidence-based practices</p>
            <p class="text">Because NCLB relies so heavily on evidence-based practices, 
              the removal of barriers to the adoption of these practices is critical 
              to the success of schools and districts in meeting AYP and also 
              in meeting the individual goals of students with disabilities. Our 
              panel listed a number of barriers to adoption in this early stage 
              of NCLB.</p>
			  <blockquote>
            <p class="text">There needs to be some endorsement of research and 
              practice to have it taken seriously. The Network for the Dissemination 
              of Curriculum Infusion is an example, where there are standards 
              for program excellence. That's what we need&#8212;some endorsement 
              by a recognized organization or process. (Federal Administrator)</p>
            <p class="text">Researchers don't know how to get good research adopted. 
              There must be a lot more marketing&#8212;best example was when [former 
              U.S. Secretary of Education] Bill Bennett gave $1 million to package 
              information on ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder) (through the Office 
              of Special Education Programs). They packaged everything for teachers, 
              students, parents, policymakers. They put ADD on the map. (Federal 
              Administrator)</p>
            <p class="text">Boards of education need to start looking at the data. 
              Funding isn't a good reason for not doing better. I think leaders 
              of organizations aren't looking at the right stuff. It doesn't have 
              to be driven by test scores. If we are looking at achievement and 
              students aren't improving, then something's wrong. People who supervise 
              principals and those who supervise the supervisors must start thinking 
              this way. (District Administrator)</p>
            <p class="text">As long as we consider just telling someone about 
              evidence-based practice as translating research to practice, we 
              will be in the same trouble. We need a fundamental switch to getting 
              individuals involved, getting personal meaning, and engaging people 
              to understand why &#8220;this&#8221; is a better way of doing things. 
              Getting groups of teachers to adapt practice, help each other, creating 
              knowledge. If simply telling people worked, it would have worked 
              25 years ago. Practitioners and administrators need to reflect.

            <p class="text">There was a concern among some panel respondents that 
              curriculum marketers pushed school districts into believing that 
              their products are evidence-based. &#8220;The biggest barrier is 
              that they [educators] are convinced by sales people. How do they 
              get beyond that? It's pretty glitzy. The sales people can say what 
              they want. It's going to take the feds to come out with glitzy evidence-based 
              stuff. It has to be easy to look at, simple to understand, so that 
              they look and read it.&#8221; (Researcher)</p>
            <p class="text">&#8220;There are a lot of curriculum marketers who 
              distribute, but they don't necessarily have the first part: the 
              evidence-based piece,&#8221; said another researcher. &#8220;We 
              need to follow the pharmaceutical practice of holding clinical trials.&#8221;</p>
			  <blockquote>
            <p class="text">Local folks are trying harder to get evidence of impact. 
              But in most parts of the country, they are terribly dependent on 
              publishers to provide that evidence. We need third-party, unbiased 
              organizations and individuals to provide evidence-based information 
              for use by practitioners, and it just doesn't exist. (Organization 
              Representative)</p>
			  </blockquote>
            <p class="text">A national organization representative said that the 
              success in implementing evidence-based practices and improving the 
              education of students with disabilities comes from a two-pronged 
              approach:</p>
			  <blockquote>
            <p class="text">The evidence has raised our thinking to a new awareness. 
              Everyone is now asking for the data. As a matter of influencing 
              policy and practice, that becomes the evidence. That is clearly 
              on a new level nationally, state, and locally. In terms of influencing 
              policy, stories still show people what it means in practice. Aggregated 
              data shows broad strategies, but people need to see what it means 
              in practice. We need a balanced combination of database decision-making 
              and the story of the scenario of what it looks like in practice. 
              (Organization Representative)</p>
			  </blockquote>
            <p class="text">Researchers clearly understood their own limitations 
              in pushing research to practice. &#8220;Many of us who do research 
              consider the end work a journal article, and that in no way moves 
              that work into usable information. There is a huge gap between what 
              we determine is the end point and what educators require. We've 
              always relied on ED [U.S. Department of Education] to do this.&#8221; 
            </p>
            <p class="text">Another strategy to help translate research is to 
              assemble a cross-section of stakeholders to look at evidence-based 
              practices. &#8220;We have to find simple, meaningful ways to look 
              at these complex issues, and learn to learn with each other. Then 
              that will become the means to a self perpetuating end.&#8221; One 
              researcher remarked: &#8220;How do you get people to do something 
              differently? How do you make change? Incentives? Motivators? What 
              I see happening is the data that has to be generated by a school 
              to stay above the level of being a non-performing school is driving 
              all of this right now. If I can get scores up for schools, who cares 
              what the method is.&#8221;</p>
            <p class="text">Other strategies focused on faculty development and 
              graduate training, the requirement of strong leadership with a clear 
              vision for faculty development. &#8220;I think one barrier is that 
              there is a tendency to see the kind of support that students need 
              is contingent on well-trained teachers and staff. One-shot in-service 
              is really insufficient. Pre-service and in-service training programs 
              need to utilize evidence-based practice in how they prepare personnel.&#8221;</p>
            <p class="centertext"><font size="2"><strong>Part III - Conclusions 
              and Recommendations</strong></font></p>          
            <p class="text">The release of this paper comes at an opportune time 
              in many respects. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act 
              is currently in the process of being reauthorized, the reauthorization 
              of the Higher Education Act is also underway, and the rules, regulations, 
              guidance, and practice of how best to manage the implementation 
              of NCLB are being refined, with states and communities learning 
              from each other as they go. We believe this paper can help inform 
              all of these efforts.</p>
            <p class="text">Affecting change in any large organization is difficult, 
              but making change in an enterprise as complex as the U.S. public 
              educational system can seem overwhelming. Yet, as we have seen from 
              the research and the comments contained in this paper, American 
              schools are on the threshold of a fundamental, systemic, and structural 
              redefinition of schooling. Just as American business and industry 
              went through significant restructuring as a result of the quality 
              improvement movement with its laser-like focus on outcomes, public 
              education is moving down a similar path as it becomes oriented to 
              outcomes and accountability, not inputs and process.</p>
            <p class="text">The impetus for the recent wide-scale change in education 
              can be traced to the No Child Left Behind Act. States and schools 
              are scrambling to ensure that all their students are performing 
              at proficient levels. The requirement of NCLB to provide outcome 
              data on groups of students may be the most powerful motivator of 
              this change. For the first time, communities are learning that their 
              schools are not as good as they thought. Often, the low performance 
              of at least two categories of students &#8211; students with disabilities 
              and non-English language learners &#8211; has gone undetected. Low 
              expectations for these and other groups of students (primarily low-income 
              students and students from diverse cultures) have frequently resulted 
              in dismal outcomes that are only now being widely reported in the 
              press. Particularly for students with disabilities, we have labored 
              under the false impression that disability means inability and let 
              too many of our young people go through high school taking low-level, 
              non-rigorous classes.</p>
            <p class="text">Of course, change is never easy, and it certainly 
              hasn't been easy as the standards-based reform movement has taken 
              hold and grown over the past decade. Almost daily reports in the 
              media reflect dissatisfaction and anger over standardized testing 
              programs, rigid and limited curriculum, and the threat of being 
              named a low-performing school. The challenge is for the education 
              enterprise to recognize that this is part of the evolutionary process 
              of moving from an input-based system to an outcomes-driven system. 
              There is no easy way to make the dramatic and far-reaching types 
              of changes that need to be made in teaching, instruction, school 
              design, professional preparation and development, assessment, and 
              community input to reach our desired outcome: that every child is 
              prepared for postsecondary education and training, a career, and 
              participation in society.</p>
            <p class="text">Signs of change are becoming evident across the country. 
              In some cases, change is slower than in others, and in some communities, 
              it is more difficult and more complex. The amount of social capital 
              and the capacity of school leaders and teachers directly influence 
              how quickly attitudes and values change and how rapidly schools 
              can be restructured to increase student achievement. </p>
            <p class="text">One obstacle that has slowed progress is the almost-nonexistent 
              body of scientifically- and evidence-based research to help guide 
              policymakers and practitioners in what works. In a similar vein, 
              policymakers often have not collected the information they need 
              (such as disaggregated data) to make informed decisions. At other 
              times, data has been collected, but has not been used to inform 
              policymaking in a meaningful way.</p>
            <p class="text">Before NCLB focused on closing the achievement gap 
              for all students, many educators paid little attention to the performance 
              of certain groups of students, such as those with disabilities. 
              While IDEA has been absolutely critical in increasing the number 
              of students with disabilities who have access to inclusive classes, 
              it has also, in some respects, resulted in a parallel education 
              system. For many years, students with disabilities have been separated 
              from their peers, not just physically, but through differential 
              instruction, assessment, teacher corps, and accountability systems. 
              At the local level, this has meant that students with disabilities 
              were often left out of accountability systems, and many general 
              educators did not feel responsible for the outcomes of students 
              with disabilities. At the U.S. Department of Education, this parallel 
              system has resulted in a similar approach of students with disabilities 
              being &#8220;taken care of&#8221; by the Office of Special Education 
              and Rehabilitative Services. Other offices generally did not concern 
              themselves with the outcomes of the students (just as non-English 
              language learners were &#8220;taken care of&#8221; by the Office 
              of English Language Acquisition). However, NCLB has changed that 
              equation. Now, every office at the U.S. Department of Education 
              must contribute to the performance of all students, including students 
              with disabilities and non-English language learners. Every office 
              must signal through its policy guidance, technical assistance, and 
              programs that they are all working toward improved outcomes for 
              all groups of students. From a leadership perspective, the Department 
              of Education needs to ensure that every office is responsible for 
              fully implementing NCLB. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="text">There are already many positive lessons to be learned 
              in the implementation of NCLB from the field, and our respondents 
              gave us many insights into what states and communities are doing 
              to ensure that every student succeeds. The respondents also provided 
              insights into the challenges faced by states and schools as they 
              seek to fulfill the vision of NCLB. The following are our recommendations 
              for policymakers, practitioners, and researchers as they work to 
              improve the outcomes for students with disabilities, based on the 
              findings of this paper.</p>
            <p class="text"><span class="red">Stay the Course.</span> While there 
              are naysayers who believe that NCLB sets too high a bar for schools 
              to meet, the vast majority of the public, researchers, and those 
              interviewed for this project believe that we must maintain high 
              expectations for all students, particularly students with disabilities. 
              Providing exemptions for students with disabilities will only reinforce 
              the belief that they cannot meet rigorous standards. Congress should 
              not back down on its commitment to helping students with disabilities 
              achieve the same high standards as other students. Already, we have 
              seen that students with disabilities have been able to master rigorous 
              curriculum and assessments, and given the necessary supports, these 
              numbers should increase. We must, however, recognize the individualized 
              needs of students with serious cognitive disabilities. The recent 
              &#8220;one percent rule&#8221; and added flexibility for states 
              to negotiate with the Department of Education in the consideration 
              of Adequate Yearly Progress for students with severe cognitive disabilities 
              is reasonable. To further maintain its commitment, Congress and 
              the Department of Education will need to ensure consistent monitoring, 
              compliance and enforcement of IDEA and NCLB. </p>
            <p class="text"><span class="red">Capacity Building.</span> Both the 
              research literature and responses from our panel point to the importance 
              of strong leadership at the school and district levels to encourage 
              and support large-scale change. Strong leadership is critical in 
              the development of teachers and classroom practices that can improve 
              student learning. In order for teachers and school leaders to help 
              students with disabilities learn to higher standards, they often 
              need to learn new instructional skills, as well as to change their 
              beliefs and values. Not only do special education teachers need 
              to learn new skills, but the general education teachers who are 
              increasingly called upon to teach students with disabilities need 
              more tools in their teaching arsenal. General and special education 
              teachers need to learn to team teach, to understand multiple and 
              diverse learning styles and methods for teaching heterogeneous groupings 
              of students, using data and assessments as instructional management 
              tools, and learn ways to change the culture of the school to one 
              of success for each student. Strong leadership is needed at both 
              the district and school levels to set high expectations, change 
              the culture, and manage the capacity-building process. Learning 
              about each of these activities involves a great deal of ongoing 
              professional development for teachers and school leaders, team meetings, 
              review of student and teacher work, and a supportive environment. 
              Public funding should be carefully directed to professional and 
              leadership development efforts that are tightly linked to the specific 
              needs of each school or district and efforts that address capacity 
              issues related to teaching and learning and helping all students, 
              particularly students with disabilities, to reach high standards. 
              The Department of Education must ensure that the billions of dollars 
              available for professional development and instructional improvement 
              through NCLB are used to support meaningful activities linked to 
              each school's capacity-building needs.</p>
            <p class="text"><span class="red">Highly Qualified Teachers.</span> 
              Currently, many schools lack highly qualified special education 
              teachers and teachers in certain disciplines. Rural and small schools 
              face even greater challenges. The education system, including higher 
              education, must find ways to prepare highly qualified teachers in 
              routes unlike those we know of today. Additionally, schools and 
              school districts need to encourage team teaching as well as the 
              use of community resources to put a qualified individual in each 
              classroom. The Department of Education should conduct research and 
              analysis on effective methods of teacher preparation, including 
              alternative routes to certification, with a particular focus on 
              special education. Standards should not be relaxed, but limited 
              flexibility such as that recently announced by the Department of 
              Education to allow more time for teachers to demonstrate their qualifications 
              in multiple disciplines and to give states flexibility in how they 
              determine qualifications is a step in the right direction. </p>
            <p class="text"><span class="red">Better Assessment Tools.</span> 
              While schools and school leaders are becoming more sophisticated 
              in assigning students with disabilities appropriate accommodations 
              when they are assessed, or in using alternative assessments, improvements 
              to the regular or underlying large-scale assessments may have a 
              greater impact on students with disabilities and many ultimately 
              benefit all children. First, assessments can be universally designed 
              so as to be used by the maximum number of children with diverse 
              learning needs, not only students with disabilities, but also non-English 
              language learners. This includes, of course, consideration of universal 
              design of test preparation materials &#8211; which would obviously 
              also be made available in alternative formats. Also, most statewide 
              assessments currently in use measure only academic skills (as required 
              by NCLB), but it is clear that the public, especially parents, would 
              like assessments that measure more than just academic skills. For 
              students with disabilities who might also be able to express themselves 
              in ways other than academic knowledge, this could be very helpful. 
              The Department of Education should conduct research and help develop 
              assessments that measure a broader range of skills (such as workplace 
              knowledge) that will help all students be more successful in careers 
              and engaged as civic members of our society. Lastly, assessments 
              need to be used by teachers and school staff on a more regular basis 
              to provide feedback on instruction. Teaching and professional development 
              programs should help teachers learn how to do this. The Department 
              of Education has an appropriate role to support research and development 
              efforts to create a new generation of assessments that:</p>
			  <blockquote>
            <p class="text">1) are appropriate for the largest number of diverse 
              students; </p>
            <p class="text">2) measure more than academic skills; </p>
            <p class="text">3) can be used more effectivetly as an instructional 
              management tool; and </p>
            <p class="text">4) result in a reduction in the number of students 
              who take alternative assessments. </p>
			  </blockquote>
            <p class="text">Congress should also support these activities in the 
              IDEA reauthorization.</p>
            <p class="text"><span class="red">Support and Disseminate Evidence-Based 
              Research and Practices.</span> NCLB's focus on data and evidence-based 
              research has led to a growing awareness of the importance of rigorous 
              research and evaluations in making policy and programmatic decisions. 
              Yet, we are hampered by the lack of quality studies, especially 
              on students with disabilities, and especially in certain areas, 
              such as dropout prevention. We clearly need a continued strong investment 
              in high quality research, and both NCLB and IDEA should support 
              the means to that end. The Department of Education should bridge 
              research efforts conducted by the Office of Special Education and 
              Rehabilitative Services and the Institute of Education Sciences, 
              and it should support research to understand how to teach more academic 
              rigor to students with disabilities and develop optimal assessment 
              tools. We look to Congress to support such activities in the reauthorization 
              of IDEA.</p>
            <p class="text">Even when research is available, it doesn't automatically 
              translate into practice in the classroom. The Department of Education 
              should provide support and leadership in translating research into 
              capacity-building tools and technical assistance for practitioners 
              and teachers. It is our hope that the Institute of Education Sciences' 
              What Works Clearinghouse and other federal efforts will play a significant 
              role in disseminating research in a way that is usable and meaningful 
              to teachers in their daily work. </p>
            <p class="text">At the same time, Congress and the Department of Education 
              will need to obtain and use the research and evaluation data generated 
              as a result of NCLB to inform and refine their decisions in terms 
              of the: (a) guidance provided to states and locales that are implementing 
              NCLB (and IDEA), and (b) overall direction the Federal Government 
              provides in its implementation of NCLB (and IDEA).</p>
            <p class="text">Lastly, because we are faced with a scarcity of quality 
              research affecting students with disabilities, practitioners and 
              policymakers must recognize that a great deal of practical knowledge 
              does exist, and until more rigorous research becomes available, 
              the Institute of Education Sciences should determine when this &#8220;craft 
              and clinical knowledge&#8221; is legitimate. </p>
            <p class="text"><span class="red">Supports for Students.</span> While 
              there is not a great deal of scientifically-based research on programs 
              to help students with disabilities improve their educational outcomes, 
              there are several studies and meta-analyses of effective practices 
              that support a strong theoretical base for much of this work. There 
              is also an emerging consensus on the principles of effective high 
              schools and the conditions needed to increase student achievement 
              for secondary school students. This body of knowledge needs to be 
              integrated into the body of knowledge regarding students with disabilities. 
              Given that we don't have the luxury to wait for the returns of recent 
              research-based studies, we should use the evidence we have regarding 
              successful supports and interventions for students. Strategies for 
              students to increase engagement in high school, reduce dropout rates, 
              and increase preparation for postsecondary education and careers 
              include higher expectations and goal setting, greater instructional 
              personalization, self-advocacy, ongoing counseling and mentoring, 
              parental involvement, and connections to the community and postsecondary 
              learning options. The Department of Education should ensure that 
              its technical assistance draws upon the knowledge base and practices 
              from all offices in its efforts to improve outcomes for students 
              with disabilities. </p>
            <p class="text"><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>
            <p class="text">The shift towards accountability, outcomes, and higher 
              expectations in our schools is leading us in the right direction, 
              although we recognize that schools face legitimate difficulties 
              during this change process. But the response to these challenges 
              should not be to back down on expectations for students with disabilities 
              and those who have been perceived as unable to meet the standards. 
              Policymakers and practitioners must remain committed to the goal 
              of closing the achievement gap for all students. To lessen this 
              commitment would be to return to the days and the mindset that only 
              some students could be and deserved to be taught to high standards. 
              We now know that by setting high expectations, and helping students, 
              teachers, administrators, and family members reach those high standards, 
              we can close the achievement gap for all students.</p>

            <p class="text">This review, sponsored by the National Council on 
              Disability, was designed to gain insight into policies and practices 
              that have shown particular success in helping students with disabilities 
              progress through the public school system. Because the No Child 
              Left Behind Act (NCLB) requires school districts to factor in outcomes 
              of students with disabilities into Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) 
              calculations, how districts serve the students under the law is 
              of critical importance. </p>
            <p class="text">Specifically, we were interested in identifying practices 
              that effectively:</p>

              with postsecondary education.</li>
			  </ul>
            <p class="text">Given the focus of our review, we raised a number 
              of issues with respondents, focused around the following questions:</p>

              the number of students with disabilities who drop out of high school 
              or increase the numbers, as some have suggested? How will the required 
              assessments or high stakes tests affect students with disabilities?

            <li class="text"> What about the Higher Education Act? Are

            <p class="text"></p>
            <p class="text">Appendix B provides a sample of evidence-based research 
              on four interventions aimed at students with disabilities. This 
              list is not meant to be exhaustive of the research, but rather, 
              an illustration of the type of research that is currently available. 
              This said, we will note that finding evidence-based research on 
              educational interventions and strategies for students with disabilities 
              is a mind-numbing practice. Quite simply, there is little research 
              in available distribution streams that fits the rigor suggested 
              by either the Institute of Educational Sciences (which has funded 
              most of the research in this area) or by the Campbell Collaboration, 
              which provides the standards for empirical investigation of education 
              and social science. We eagerly await the outcomes of a current Office 
              of Special Education Programs (OSEP)-funded study by the Colorado 
              State University on evidence-based practices for students with disabilities, 
              expected to conclude in 2005. That study, which will review more 
              than 3,000 reports, studies, and articles, should shed considerably 
              more light on evidence-based practices for students with disabilities. 
            </p>
            <p class="text">In our review, a large majority of studies relied 
              on simple descriptive outcome data (e.g., percentage of students 
              that completed the program; grade point averages of students, etc.). 
              Very few utilized a control group, and even fewer used random assignment 
              procedures to create treatment and control groups. Second, we feel 
              that it is possible that some researchers have not bothered to publish 
              their findings, or that publication bias has possibly eliminated 
              their studies from publication. The reality is that, if unpublished 
              in some form that prohibits dissemination, the studies literally 
              might as well not exist. We believe that this has happened to many 
              OSEP-funded projects. </p>
            <p class="text">If anything is learned from our experience, the following 
              summaries should serve to bring attention to the problem associated 
              with finding evidence-based practices for professionals who serve 
              students with disabilities. If they can't find them, they can't 
              implement them.</p>
            <p class="text">Please note that we use some verbatim language in 
              the following research summaries to provide more accurate depictions 
              of the programs, rather than a presentation of our insightful and 
              creative ability to transform the words of others into something 
              coherent. We just want to be accurate. We have provided references

              Exceptional Children, 65(1).</p>
            <p class="text"><span class="red">OVERVIEW:</span> Check and Connect 
              is a dropout prevention and intervention procedure developed to 
              encourage middle school youth at high risk of dropping out to remain 
              engaged in school and on track to graduate. The procedure was shaped 
              by the collaborative efforts of individuals who interacted directly 
              with the target students, including teachers, family members, and 
              community outreach workers, as well as by the input of a district 
              special education coordinator, researchers from the University, 
              and the students themselves. A core component of the model is a 
              &#8220;monitor&#8221; whose primary goal was to keep students, families, 
              and teachers focused on the education process and reduce and prevent 
              the occurrence of absenteeism, suspensions, failing grades, and 
              other warning signs of school withdrawal. The monitor regularly 
              checked students' engagement with school and promptly facilitated 
              efforts to build and maintain connections that would help students 
              stay in school. A monitor working 20 hours per week carried an average 
              caseload of 25 students, and often worked with the same students 
              over several years.</p>
            <p class="text">Risk factors were logged each day by the monitor and 
              tabulated each month (the &#8220;Check&#8221;). The &#8220;Connect&#8221; 
              consisted of two interventions: basic interventions provided to 
              all students at least once a month; and intensive interventions 
              that were provided to students who showed &#8220;high risk&#8221; 
              on the daily monitor logs. </p>
            <p class="text">Basic interventions consisted of four strategies: 
              (a) sharing general information with the student about the monitoring 
              system, (b) providing regular feedback to the student about his 
              or her educational progress, (c) regularly discussing the importance 
              of staying in school, and (d) problem-solving with the student regarding 
              risk factors. Intensive interventions drew upon three broad areas 
              of support: (a) problem-solving, (b) academic support, and (c) recreational 
              and community service exploration.</p>
            <p class="text"><span class="red">METHODOLOGY:</span> An experimental 
              design was used to evaluate this program. One treatment group (47 
              students) and one control group (47 students) were selected from 
              a universe of students with emotional/behavioral disabilities enrolled 
              in a northern Midwest urban school district. All 94 students received 
              dropout prevention interventions in Grades 7 and 8. At the end of 
              eighth grade, the students were randomly assigned to either the 
              treatment or control group using a stratified selection procedure 
              (ethnicity, sex, socioeconomic status, disability, age, as well 
              as a variable referred to as the &#8220;profile rating&#8221;). 
              Half of the students continued to receive intervention through ninth 
              grade. </p>
            <p class="text">The effectiveness of the Check and Connect intervention 
              was assessed by conducting post-test comparisons between the treatment 
              and control groups in the ninth grade (pretest comparisons found 
              no differences). The appropriate test statistic was used (e.g., 
              t-test, chi-square test of independence), depending on the type 
              of data.</p>
            <p class="text"><span class="red">EVIDENCE OF SUCCESS:</span> Students 
              who received intervention through ninth grade were significantly 
              more engaged in school than control group students. The treatment 
              students were more likely to be enrolled in school at the end of 
              the year (91%) than were students in the control group (70%), X

              during the first year of high school than control group students, 
              t(90) = 4.01, p &lt; 0.05.</p>
            <p class="text">Treatment students were also more likely to be on

              Hoffman, A. (2002). Lessons learned from implementing the steps 
              to self-determination curriculum. Remedial &amp; Special Education, 
              23(2).</p>
            <p class="text"><span class="red">OVERVIEW:</span> The Steps to Self-Determination 
              curriculum was published in 1996 in response to the emerging emphasis 
              on self-determination in special education. This emphasis on self-determination 
              came about as persons with disabilities and their friends and families 
              began to advocate for roles and expectations for individuals with 
              disabilities that were more consistent with adult expectations, 
              and as educators, advocates, and policymakers searched for strategies 
              to improve post-school outcomes for students with disabilities.</p>
            <p class="text">The purpose of Steps to Self-Determination curriculum 
              is to help students develop the knowledge, beliefs, and skills that 
              they need to become more self-determined. Steps to Self-Determination 
              (Steps) is an 18-session curriculum based on a self-determination 
              model that includes five major components: Know Yourself, Value 
              Yourself, Plan, Act, and Experience Outcomes and Learn. The first 
              two components, Know Yourself and Value Yourself, describe the internal 
              processes that provide the foundation for self-determination, and 
              the latter three components describe specific skills that evolve 
              from that foundation and comprise the action stage of the model. 
              The action stage includes the achievement of skills associated with 
              self-determination and the evaluation and celebration processes 
              that enhance and crystallize a sense of self-determination. </p>
            <p class="text">Steps is an experientially-based curriculum. Students 
              establish and work toward goals as they learn self-determination 
              knowledge and skills. The curriculum was designed to be used in 
              integrated (i.e., including students with and without disabilities) 
              or separate (e.g., resource room, self-contained class) environments 
              and in a variety of scheduling arrangements. It can be included 
              in existing courses or taught as a separate class or extracurricular 
              activity. Teachers participate in the curriculum as co-learners 
              with the students, to provide role models and to create a collaborative 
              classroom climate. Parents or other significant persons in the students' 
              lives are also involved, to support the students' efforts.</p>
            <p class="text">As a result of the increased emphasis on self-determination, 
              the Steps curriculum has been used for 5 years in both high school 
              and middle school settings and in general and special education 
              settings. Through federally-funded outreach projects, specialized 
              support has been provided to assist teams in implementing the curriculum 
              in the states of Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, Utah, and Washington. 
              Support for implementation of the curriculum has also been provided 
              in other states, through state and local initiatives.</p>
            <p class="text"><span class="red">METHODOLOGY/EVIDENCE OF SUCCESS:</span> 
              The curriculum was initially field tested in diverse socioeconomic 
              and ethnic high school settings in the U.S. Midwest, and consisted 
              of a treatment group that used the Steps curriculum and a control 
              group that did not use the curriculum. A t test between the treatment 
              and the control group indicated a significant increase (p = .002) 
              in the correct responses on the Self-Determination Knowledge Scale, 
              with an effect size of 1.02. This effect size is considered to be 
              a very large treatment effect. To put this in perspective, if a 
              group's knowledge of self-determination skills was at the 50th percentile, 
              the curriculum would be expected to improve that level to the 85th 
              percentile. Second, the effect of a pre-test/post-test treatment 
              vs. control group of the effectiveness of the curriculum, as measured 
              by the Self-Determination Observational Checklist scores showed 
              a significant increase (p = .000) in student behaviors that are 
              considered to be correlates of self-determination. A subsequent 
              study of the Steps curriculum with students with behavioral and 
              learning disabilities found a significant pre-post increase in internal 
              locus of control after participation in the Steps curriculum, while 
              yet another did not find any significant post-test outcome. </p>
            <p class="text"><span class="red">CONCLUSIONS:</span> Additional research 
              has found that use of the Steps curriculum resulted in an increase 
              in knowledge and behaviors associated with self-determination, an 
              increase in locus of control, and a decrease in features associated 
              with depression. Self-determined, innovative teachers have embraced 
              the process of change and implemented a self-determination focus 
              in ways that meet specific needs of students in their classrooms 
              through implementation of the Steps curriculum. This points to the 
              need to develop and implement additional resources to support the 
              self-determination of teachers.</p>

            <p class="text"><span class="red">OVERVIEW:</span> This case study 
              discusses school-to-work transition for students with disabilities 
              through the Youth Transition Program (YTP), a statewide collaborative 
              effort including 26 communities throughout the state of Oregon. 
              YTP began in 1990 as a cooperative effort between the Oregon Department 
              of Education (ODE), the Oregon Vocational Rehabilitation Division 
              (OVRD), the University of Oregon (UO), and the local public school 
              systems.</p>
            <p class="text">The YTP was developed with the basic goal of placement 
              in meaningful competitive employment or career-related postsecondary 
              training for youth with disabilities. The YTP serves disabled youth 
              beginning in their completion year of high school and continues 
              for two years of follow-up services, depending upon the student's 
              needs. YTP's services are provided jointly by school and vocational 
              rehabilitation staff and include: paid job training with on-site 
              monitoring and support; job-related instruction in academic, vocational, 
              independent living, and personal/social content areas; individualized 
              transition planning; placement in a job upon leaving school; and 
              follow-up support.</p>
            <p class="text">The YTP serves disabled youth who are eligible for 
              vocational rehabilitation services and who are able to become competitively 
              employed without long-term support. This includes students who: 
              (1) are on track to complete school, but need YTP services to achieve 
              post-school vocational goals; (2) are still in school, but at great 
              risk of dropping out; and (3) have already dropped out of school, 
              and are unemployed or underemployed. YTP started as a pilot project 
              that included 7 sites. By 1993 13 local communities were serving 
              as YTP sites. When this study was conducted in 1995, a total of 
              26 communities representing 24 of 26 vocational rehabilitation field 
              offices and half of all high school districts in the state were 
              participating in YTP. Since 1990, through a combination of state 
              and federal funding, approximately 8.5 million dollars has been 
              allocated to support YTP activities through 1995. Statewide, over 
              1,500 students with disabilities will receive YTP services between 
              1990 and 1995.</p>
            <p class="text"><span class="red">METHODOLOGY:</span> Unlike most 
              school systems and programs, YTP has carried out a comprehensive 
              evaluation effort to document the impact of the program on specific 
              student outcomes and systems change. Data were collected from each 
              site on a variety of demographic and programmatic factors (e.g., 
              student demographic data, job placements, training efforts, community 
              outreach activities, improvements in coordination, etc.), and data 
              were collected during a two-year follow-up period. YTP outcome data 
              were analyzed relative to the outcomes of comparison groups, including 
              a statewide sample of students with disabilities who exit school, 
              a sample of non-YTP/VR clients in the state, and a nationwide sample 
              from the National Longitudinal Transition Study (NLTS) (Wagner and 
              Shaver, 1992). Second, YTP examined student outcomes separately 
              for two groups of program participants in order to determine of 
              the program's impact: (1) rural versus non-rural YTP participants; 
              and (2) YTP students identified as &#8220;at-risk&#8221; compared 
              to those not considered &#8220;at-risk.&#8221;</p>
            <p class="text"><span class="red">EVIDENCE OF SUCCESS:</span> When 
              YTP compared employment outcomes for students' highest paying jobs 
              within two years of leaving school, YTP students:</p>
			  <ul>
            <li class="text"> earned higher hourly wages than the students 
              in the Oregon disability sample ($5.69/hour vs. $5.31/hour).</li>
            <li class="text"> earned higher weekly wages ($181/week vs. 
              $157/week).</li>
            <li class="text"> were more likely to still be on the job (70% 
              vs. 56%).</li>
            <li class="text"> were less likely to have lost a job for negative 
              reasons (27% vs. 40%).</li>
			  </ul>
            <p class="text">When YTP/VR clients were compared to VR clients of 
              similar ages, types, and disabilities, YTP clients were more likely 
              to:</p>
			  <ul>
            <li class="text"> be determined eligible for VR services (76% 
              vs. 52%).</li>
            <li class="text"> remain in the rehabilitation process (57% 
              vs. 27%).</li>
            <li class="text"> earn higher weekly wages at closure ($177/week 
              vs. $143/week).</li>
			  </ul>
            <p class="text">YTP examined student outcomes compared to a national 
              sample drawn from the NLTS in the areas of employment and productive 
              engagement. NLTS defines productive engagement as students either 
              working or participating in postsecondary activities. When the YTP 
              students were compared to the national NLTS sample for the first 
              two years out of school, YTP students were:</p>
			  <ul>
            <li class="text"> more likely to be competitively employed 
              (67% vs. 46%).</li>
            <li class="text"> more likely to be employed full-time (39% 
              vs. 25%).</li>
            <li class="text"> less likely to be unemployed (32% vs. 46%).</li>
            <li class="text"> more likely to be productively engaged (95% 
              vs. 64%).</li>
			  </ul>
            <p class="text">Another demonstration of YTP's success is the fact 
              that it appears to equally benefit students who are living in rural 
              areas and non-rural areas, as well as at-risk students. </p>
            <p class="text"><span class="red">CONCLUSIONS:</span> In summary, 
              the Youth Transition Program had an impact on outcomes for students 
              who demonstrate moderate to severe disabilities and face significant 
              barriers to employment. The YTP shows that positive outcomes occur 
              when systems intervene early in the transition years and provide 
              for people-centered planning and placement activities. The program 
              also demonstrates encouraging effects on students' social development 
              when programs provide for students' independent living and social 
              support needs. YTP's success is also linked to the implementation 
              of a program designed from a research-base. The local success of 
              individual YTPs attest to the utility of incorporating universal 
              design concepts across sites, while maintaining program flexibility. 
              Finally, YTP can be credited with creating local systems change 
              through state-level support.</p>

              a randomized field-test of TAKE CHARGE for the Future, a multi-component 
              model to promote student involvement in transition planning. TAKE 
              CHARGE for the Future has as its centerpiece student-directed participation 
              in personally-relevant transition planning and preparation activities 
              in school, community, and home settings. Students learn that they 
              are responsible for promoting their own transition success: they 
              are exposed to specific strategies to identify, communicate and 
              achieve their transition goals, and they are provided with the information 
              and support necessary to ensure their success. Students complete 
              a self-help focused curriculum, and they receive coaching and support 
              to identify their transition goals, participate in their transition 
              planning meetings, formulate systematic plans for goal attainment, 
              and perform activities to achieve their goals. Information and support 
              are concurrently provided to school staff and families to expand 
              their capacities to assist youth. Peer support and mentorship opportunities 
              are organized to bolster youth transition knowledge, confidence 
              and support networks.</p>
            <p class="text"><span class="red">METHODOLOGY:</span> Forty-three 
              youth (14 to 17 year olds) from 4 high schools in small, medium 
              and large communities in New Hampshire, North Carolina, Oregon and 
              Wisconsin participated in the study. The youth experienced learning, 
              emotional, orthopedic or other health disabilities. A two-independent 
              group, repeated measures design was utilized to evaluate the impact 
              of the intervention. Following consent, participants were randomized 
              to the treatment or wait list group. Subjects in the treatment group 
              participated in TAKE CHARGE for 4 months. The intervention included 
              5 elements: (a) individual, 50 minute bi-weekly coaching sessions 
              for youth, (b) monthly community-based workshops for youth, their 
              parents and successful adult mentors, (c) community activities performed 
              by mentors and students, (d) telephone and home visit support for 
              parents, and (e) inservice education for transition staff. Various 
              instruments were used to measure youth participation in transition 
              planning, student and parent transition awareness, youth empowerment,

              in transition planning activities, transition awareness, empowerment, 
              and engagement in transition planning meetings than those in the 
              control group. Additionally, students in the treatment group were 
              more directive and engaged while other participants were less dominant 
              and more responsive to student engagement. Findings confirm that, 
              without systematic intervention to promote their involvement, many 
              students sit passively in their transition planning meetings while 
              others control the discourse.</p>
            <p class="text"><span class="red">CONCLUSIONS:</span> On the whole, 
              the findings suggest that interventions such as TAKE CHARGE hold 
              promise for enhancing the transition planning of youth with disabilities. 
              Other approaches that emphasize skill development, mentorship, or 
              family support lend credibility to our findings, which highlight 
              the importance of these intervention components.</p>
            <p class="text">The most important contribution of this study is likely 
              its validation of the impact of a semester-long intervention on 
              the transition planning competence and behavior of youth, as judged 
              by youth, parents, educators, and outside observers. It is clear 
              that many of the competencies required for successful transition 
              planning &#8211; identifying and working toward future goals, building 
              partnerships with others, and managing barriers that arise &#8211; 
              are critical for success throughout life. If educators, parents 
              and community members can work together to assist young people to 
              cultivate these capacities during adolescence, it can lead to an 
              important investment in the future.</p>
            <p class="text">The authors note that the results of this study should 
              be interpreted cautiously because of the &#8220;relatively small 
              sample size&#8221; which impacts the generalizability of the findings.</p>
