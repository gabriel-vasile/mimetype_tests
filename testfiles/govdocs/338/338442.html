<h4 class="orange">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h4>

<strong>BACKGROUND</strong>

<p>
In the United States, political leaders, planning professionals, and private citizens are increasingly aware of the connections between land use policies and transportation planning. Transportation infrastructure and land use guidelines create the framework within which communities grow, influencing urban and rural development, economic prosperity, environmental quality, and social equity. In many states, however, transportation and land use policies are often considered separately, a disassociation that can lead to inefficient resource-use and excessive environmental impact. 
</p>
<p>
Designing transportation systems that enhance mobility, economic opportunity, and community livability is a major challenge for many communities across the country. To more closely examine local efforts to integrate transportation and land use policies, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) sponsored a domestic scan tour from September 30 to October 4, 2002. The scan team 
visited Denver, Colorado, Salt Lake City, Utah, and Teton County, Wyoming. Each of these communities is experiencing growth challenges and is exploring strategies for better integrating transportation and land use. 
</p>
<p>
The tour was modeled upon the tradition of the international scan tour, a long-standing effort at FHWA to share information between the United States and other countries on issues relating to transportation planning, design, construction, maintenance, and technology. The work of the scan tour was also based in part on the principles articulated by the FHWA Transportation and Community and System Preservation Pilot (TCSP) Program: to improve the efficiency of the transportation system; to reduce the environmental impacts of transportation; to reduce the need for costly future public infrastructure investments; to ensure efficient access to jobs, services, and centers of trade; and to examine development patterns and identify strategies to encourage compatible private-sector activity.
</p>

<h4 class="orange">PROJECTS VISITED</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Denver Union Station (Denver, Colorado) - The rehabilitation of the historic train station in downtown Denver to accommodate new modes of public transit, as well as pedestrians and bicycle users, in order to increase transportation options and create an urban transportation hub.</li>
	<li>Stapleton (Denver, Colorado) - The redevelopment of the site of the former Stapleton Airport, using innovative planning and construction techniques to design a new neighborhood that will offer environmentally sustainable residential and commercial space within walking distance of public transit.</li>
	<li>Envision Utah (Salt Lake City, Utah) - A community-based visioning and planning process, designed to develop and implement the Quality Growth Strategy, a program to preserve open space, promote water conservation and clean air, improve regional transportation systems, and provide housing options for all residents. The process includes extensive public outreach efforts and offers tools for local communities to use in implementing policies and practices of sustainability.</li>
	<li>Mapping for a Millennium (Teton County, Wyoming) - A three-part process of public design charrettes established to develop new ideas for the reconstruction of crucial transportation corridors in Teton County, a rural resort community and the gateway to both Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks. The charrettes also facilitate the development of community preservation strategies and mixed-use, transit-oriented neighborhoods.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="orange">OBSERVATIONS</h4>

Whether through partnerships, public participation, or new planning tools, each of the projects visited has established innovative planning mechanisms for the coordination of transportation and land use policies. This shared experience, and the individual efforts of the four projects to develop new approaches to planning, framed much of what the scan team heard during its visits. The following lessons can be drawn from the projects visited about the challenges and opportunities associated with transportation and land use integration.
<ul>
	<li>Planning solutions should be developed and supported locally. Although the projects visited by the scan team share certain regional similarities, the individual methods developed for the coordination of transportation planning and land use policies differ by community. Lessons and best practices can be shared, but ultimately, successful solutions should be the result of local needs and local processes and should respect local values.</li>
	<li>Planning efforts that fail to include sufficient public outreach and participation are unlikely to succeed. A 1997 ballot initiative to expand public transit in Denver was rejected by voters, forcing a comprehensive rethinking of the future of transportation in the Denver area and the specific uses of Denver Union Station. Planning efforts, particularly innovative efforts, that move ahead without sufficient attention to public involvement and concurrence can generate discord and delay implementation.</li>
	<li>Physical design matters as much as good planning. The scan team encountered multiple examples of the importance of high-quality, well-considered physical design in the development of new modes of land use planning. Planning alone is not sufficient to create a successful development, one which integrates transportation and land use in a way that will attract new users and residents. The aesthetic appearance, the ease of use, and the connectivity of design are all important factors.</li>
	<li>Available funding sources should be calculated and used in innovative ways in order to most effectively leverage all available resources. The financial needs of a project and the levels of available funding should be tentatively calculated, and then revisited, throughout the planning process. Many multimodal transportation and infrastructure projects are completed in stages, with each component planned and financed independently. Such incremental projects lend themselves to the use of multiple sources of funding, each source dedicated to a different aspect of the project. When used in concert, a variety of funding sources can allow for a project to include innovative elements and to be completed more efficiently than if it depended upon a single source of funding. In order for projects to become a reality, financial plans should be updated as design plans are gradually finalized.</li>
	<li>The local development climate will strongly influence efforts to coordinate transportation and land use planning. To be effective, planning should take into account the realities of the private development environment, including issues of financing, demand, and timing. In Denver, an active market for private development in the downtown area, coupled with municipal design guidelines, has created an atmosphere in which the rehabilitation of Denver Union Station is viable. In Teton County, a recent boom in the construction of vacation homes has put pressure on local transportation infrastructure and the local housing market, stretching the resources of the county and generating interest in long-term regional planning. In these ways, public projects are linked to patterns of private development.</li>
	<li>Ideas should be presented in ways that make sense for a particular community. Creative planning efforts should find ways to present ideas, particularly contentious ideas, in locally acceptable language and context. The political and cultural environment varies by community, and planning projects should use a vocabulary that resonates in the community in which it will be used.</li>
	<li>Innovative planning ideas can move beyond established processes and regulations, requiring old policies to be revised and updated. New methods of planning and visioning, particularly those that are grounded in community participation, can present a challenge to established planning regulations. Innovative proposals may be stymied in their efforts to move ahead because of existing zoning and transportation policies, which are often geared toward large-lot, low-density, automobile-oriented development. The scan team observed this dynamic in the Utah community of Murray, in which a new plan for a transit-oriented neighborhood has been hampered by a traditional zoning code that discourages creative planning solutions. With time, new and innovative planning processes must be integrated into the existing systems of planning in order to maintain the strength of the established planning processes while allowing for new methods to be explored.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="orange">INTRODUCTION</h4>
<a name="back"></a>
<h4 class="orange">BACKGROUND</h4>

<p>The issue of growth is increasingly important in many American communities, as civic leaders and citizens alike work to find ways to ensure viable, long-term economic prosperity while preserving historic community character. The concept of livability - the notion that growth and development should occur in ways that enhance the human and natural environments in the present and also protect them over the long term - has taken root across the United States, introducing a new framework for local and regional planning. Communities are beginning to consider innovative ideas for meeting the needs of their residents, whether for transportation, housing, shopping, or recreation.</p>

<p>Better coordination between transportation and land use allows communities to plan more comprehensively for housing, for commercial and retail uses, and for the provision of education and other public services, all in the context of accessible transportation. This can mean the installation of a new public transit line, the construction of bicycle or pedestrian paths, or the redesign of a much-used roadway, depending on the needs of the individual community. With its focus on providing options that meet local needs while protecting local assets, sustainable planning offers flexibility and choice.</p>

<p>The development of a multimodal approach to transportation planning strengthens the transportation system by providing redundancy and reducing demand on any single mode. Increased use of alternative transportation can also improve the environmental quality of an area by reducing air pollution and conserving open space. Further, the presence of multiple transportation modes in a community can offer much-needed alternatives for some populations, including children, the elderly, the disabled, and low-income residents.</p>

<p>To more closely examine local efforts to integrate transportation and land use policies, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) sponsored a domestic scan tour to Denver, Colorado, Salt Lake City, Utah, and Teton County, Wyoming from September 30 to October 4, 2002. The scan team included representatives from FHWA, state and local transportation planning agencies, and the Volpe National Transportation Systems Center. The tour was modeled upon the tradition of the international scan tour, a long-standing effort at FHWA to share information between the United States and other countries on issues relating to transportation planning, design, construction, maintenance, and technology.</p>

<p>The scan tour focused on innovative planning processes and methodologies that were consistent with the goals of the FHWA Transportation and Community and System Preservation Pilot (TCSP) Program, which was established by the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century. The TCSP Program provides funding for planning and implementation projects and for technical assistance to investigate the relationship among transportation, community preservation, and 
private-sector development initiatives. Since fiscal year 1999, the TCSP Program has awarded approximately $367 million in local grants to assist communities across the country.</p>

<a name="cont"></a>
<h4 class="orange">CONTEXT</h4>

Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming were identified as states for which the management of rapid growth and the long-term safeguarding of valuable environmental resources are significant issues. To study the experiences of communities within these three states and to consider their applicability elsewhere, the scan team met with individuals and organizations in each state engaged in visioning or other planning and development processes that consider the connections among transportation planning, land use decision-making, and quality of life issues. Among others, the scan team met with individuals working on behalf of city, county, and state government; local political officials; real estate developers; and representatives of non-profit organizations. In each community, the scan team members also were able to visit projects, use transportation systems - aviation, highway, and public transit - study development patterns, and observe the planning and development context of the area.
<a name="obj"></a>
<h4 class="orange">OBJECTIVES</h4>
The purpose of the domestic scan tour was to obtain, highlight, and share best practices and lessons learned in the coordination of transportation and land use planning, particularly coordination among local and state departments of transportation (DOTs), metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs), FHWA division offices, and transportation consultants and contractors. Additionally, of particular interest to the scan team were methods, especially innovative methods, used to involve the general public in major decisions about the development of policies on transportation and land use.

<h4 class="orange">PROJECTS VISITED</h4>

<h4 class="green">Denver Union Station - Denver, Colorado</h4>
In Denver, the scan team met with representatives of the Denver Community Planning and Development Agency (CPDA), the municipal office responsible for all planning, design, and development within the City of Denver. In 2000, CPDA received $175,000 from the TCSP Program to plan for the development of alternative transportation infrastructure at Denver Union Station. First constructed in 1881, Denver Union Station was spared demolition during the period of urban renewal and today offers the potential for a multimodal transportation hub near the commercial heart of Denver. The TCSP-supported effort included studies on the installation of full-service bicycle facilities and an electric vehicle hub at the station, as well as an extension of the existing Historic Platte Valley Trolley to the station. Technical and feasibility studies have been undertaken for all three components of the project, which together complement a large-scale master planning process on the long-term future of the station. The master plan is currently underway and is expected to be completed in 2004. The bicycle facilities - which include storage units, changing areas, and on-site repair services - will be installed shortly, and the electric vehicle facilities are expected to be operational in 2003. The extension of the historic trolley service, which is anticipated to cost approximately $20 million, has no established completion date at the moment. Each of these new transportation facilities will bolster the use of the regional light-rail service that has recently been expanded to serve the station. 

<p>Denver Union Station has been the subject of extensive planning efforts over the past decade, all aimed at restoring it to its earlier use as an urban transportation hub, connecting Denver with its outlying suburbs and beyond. Many organizations and individuals have been involved with planning for the future of the station, including CPDA, the local MPO, the regional transit authority, the Colorado DOT, local landowners, and a quasi-public corporation established to oversee initial planning for the reuse of the station. A redeveloped station is expected to play a major role in the future growth of downtown Denver, linking present and prospective rail networks with major highways, existing public transit systems, and other planned transportation infrastructure.
</p>
<h4 class="green">Stapleton Redevelopment - Denver, Colorado</h4>
In Denver, the scan team also toured the Stapleton redevelopment site, a project to transform the site of the former Stapleton Airport (closed in 1995) into a mixed-use neighborhood to include residential, commercial, and retail uses. The redevelopment of Stapleton is based on a multi-decade development plan, the first portions of which have only recently been completed. The Stapleton project encompasses 4,700 acres, of which more than 1,100 have been set aside for use as open space and parkland. The Cleveland-based private real estate company chosen by the City of Denver to lead Stapleton's redevelopment works closely with the municipal government to address issues such as zoning, location of utilities, transportation infrastructure, open space, and environmental remediation.

<p>The Stapleton Development Plan, adopted by the Denver City Council in 1995, espouses the values of sustainable development, promoting pedestrian- and transit-oriented development, the use of environmentally sensitive building materials, the installation of environmentally appropriate landscaping, and the inclusion of advanced technologies. Environmental responsibility, economic opportunity, social equity, and quality design are at the core of the vision for Stapleton, a vision of an economically diverse community in which transportation by foot, bicycle, and public transit is supported through design decisions and policy choices. To provide residential options for a diversity of income levels, Stapleton will offer a range of housing choices, from multi-family units to large single-family homes. Furthermore, the major residential, civic, and commercial components of the community will be linked by a system of greenways, for use by cyclists and pedestrians. The retail and commercial construction will also be accessible by pedestrians and cyclists. Stapleton is designed to be a community in which automobile ownership is an option and walking and cycling are viable alternatives for transportation.

<h4 class="green">Envision Utah - Salt Lake City, Utah</h4>
In Salt Lake City, the scan team met with representatives of Envision Utah, a 
public/private partnership founded in 1997 to research growth scenarios for the Greater Wasatch Area1 and to provide guidance, based on public input, on future development in the region. Envision Utah focuses on transportation, housing, employment, economic development, and resource conservation. Envision Utah received TCSP funding grants in 1999 and 2000 totaling $630,000 to develop methods for predicting growth patterns and to support a public outreach campaign on development issues. Envision Utah worked with Utah state government on the development of the growth scenarios, and has continued to partner with state and local governments in the implementation of policies of sustainability.


<p align="center"><img src="images/fig4.jpg" width="325" height="244" alt="" border="0"></p>
<p align="center">Pedestrian-oriented signage in Salt Lake City</p>

<p>
The work of Envision Utah is based on the Quality Growth Strategy, a planning vision developed through an extensive public outreach process. Compared to a baseline scenario with typical development patterns and infrastructure, the Quality Growth scenario includes an expanded transit system, a higher proportion of multi-family housing and small-lot homes, and greater clustering of new housing in villages and towns along major roads and rail lines. Based on the Strategy, Envision Utah has supported efforts in the Greater Wasatch Area to enhance mobility, provide a diverse supply of housing and employment options, improve air quality, maintain water reserves, and protect open spaces. Envision Utah works with private developers, state and local leaders, and private citizens to encourage the prioritization of alternatives that promote livability and community preservation. An example of Envision Utah's work includes its partnership with the community of Murray City, a partnership to assist local leaders in planning for transit-oriented residential and commercial development near a new light-rail station in the city. In addition, Envision Utah works with and encourages developers to build mixed-use, walkable projects, such as the Gateway Retail Center in Salt Lake City, to help revitalize urban centers.

<h4 class="green">Mapping for a Millennium - Teton County, Wyoming</h4>
In Teton County, the scan team met with representatives of the Teton County Planning and Development Department and the Wyoming Department of Transportation (WYDOT). Because of its proximity to ski resorts and its location within easy driving distance of Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks, Teton County is a popular vacation destination. As a resort region, Teton County is experiencing rapid population growth and high levels of annual visitation, placing an intense demand on its traditional transportation infrastructure. The effort to balance the needs and priorities of multiple constituencies - the year-round residents, the part-time residents, and the tourist population - requires the thoughtful creation of local and regional partnerships and the development of a planning process that is sensitive to the wishes and expectations of all of the affected stakeholders. In 2000, the Teton County Planning and Development Department received $342,805 from the TCSP Program to support a series of public charrettes on the redesign of several important transportation corridors in the county. The goal of this effort is to develop strategies and recommendations for corridor improvements that meet the mobility needs of a growing population while simultaneously reflecting the values of the surrounding community and its adjacent neighborhoods.

<p>
Although still in the early planning stages, the work of the public charrettes has established an innovative framework for comprehensively addressing the relationship among transportation, land use, and growth in Teton County. In preparation for the community-based design charrettes, the Teton County Planning and Development Department met with and interviewed residents, property owners, and other individuals interested in the relevant highway corridors. Some of the meetings were formal and others informal, and all focused on issues of congestion, safety, parking, community character, and quality of life in the county. This process of stakeholder interviews enriched the charrette process by providing a diversity of opinions and viewpoints. The charrette results and recommendations are being used to inform the development of alternatives for highway corridor improvements in Teton County.

<p align="center">Highway to Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming</p>


<h4 class="orange">SUMMARY</h4>

Each of the four projects visited has its own focus, reflecting the needs of its surrounding community. Envision Utah played a lead role in the development of the Quality Growth Strategy, which is a tool for local communities to better plan for the integration of transportation and land use. The Stapleton project, the result of a long-term process of inclusive public-private planning, will provide Denver residents with a large new community, which includes multiple transportation, commercial, and housing options to meet the diverse needs of its residents. Both the Denver Union Station and the Teton County projects are still in the planning stages, working with the public and with planning professionals to develop transportation alternatives.


<h4 class="orange">OBSERVATIONS</h4>

The efforts to develop new planning methods and mechanisms observed in the four projects 
visited can be grouped into three categories: partnerships, leveraging resources, and 
demonstrating results. Each of these three themes is highlighted below, with specific supporting examples from the projects visited.

<a name="part"></a>
<h4 class="orange">PARTNERSHIPS</h4>

Partnerships have taken a number of forms for the projects visited, from informal relationships among influential individuals and organizations to formal agreements between public agencies. In Denver, Salt Lake City, and Teton County, the formation of partnerships has helped to build consensus by bringing together groups with different viewpoints to discuss common issues and to find solutions together. Partnerships observed by the scan team include relationships across geographic boundaries, relationships with organizations outside the realm of transportation, and relationships with key members of the private sector, including developers, financial institutions, and real estate professionals. For the projects visited, partnerships have helped to integrate the needs of industry with community concerns, facilitating the movement of goods, access to jobs, and economic development.

<p>
The following are examples of successful partnering efforts from the four projects visited:
</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/fig7.jpg" width="233" height="350" alt="Denver Union Station" border="0"></p>
<p align="center">Denver Union Station</p>

<p>
Public sector collaboration to plan the future of urban transportation. In 1996, 
following a preliminary feasibility study, the Union Station Transport Development Company (USTDC) was founded to oversee the planning, both short- and long-term, for the 
redevelopment of Denver Union Station. The USTDC was funded by contributions from the City and County of Denver, the Colorado DOT, the Regional Transit District, private property owners, and grants, and helped create the initial institutional relationships that have made collaborative planning possible for the station and have brought the public into the planning process, particularly around issues of pedestrian and bicycle access. The process of developing a master plan is now underway for the station, under the leadership of the Union Station Alliance, a public-private partnership dedicated to the master planning effort. The master planning process involves significant public outreach and involvement, including large public meetings held at the Colorado Convention Center and a mechanism for public input through the Denver Union Station website. The level of collaboration represented by the partners involved with the overall planning process for the station, coupled with ongoing public participation, gives credibility to the process and allows institutional obstacles to be overcome.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Path-breaking methods of public participation to produce unique planning outcomes. Envision Utah's work is guided by the Quality Growth Strategy, a program of six goals for ensuring sustainability and livability in the Salt Lake City region. The Quality Growth Strategy was developed following an extensive public participation campaign, which included the public distribution of in-depth surveys on issues of regional growth, mobility, conservation, transportation, and economic development. Of the 570,000 surveys distributed through daily newspapers and weekly advertising supplements in January 1999, 17,000 were completed and returned to Envision Utah, complementing 50 town meetings held throughout the region. Public outreach on issues of growth, development, and environmental preservation was also conducted through individual interviews, mailed flyers, newspaper inserts, and television and radio advertisements featuring local leaders and celebrities. Envision Utah now promotes the values of the Quality Growth Strategy in its work with Utah communities, as in its work with the Davis County Shore Lands Vision, in which Envision Utah is working with the communities of Davis County to plan for the sustainable development and preservation of open space on the shores of the Great Salt Lake.</li>
	<li>Public-private partnering to create a new neighborhood. The redevelopment of the Stapleton Airport site is a project of unprecedented scale and scope, in which 4,700 acres of land are gradually being transformed into housing, open space, and commercial properties. In 2000, following an extensive public planning process, a private developer was chosen by the City of Denver to purchase the bulk of the Stapleton site, over time, and to manage the development of the infrastructure, buildings, and parkland that will make up the new community. The developer works collaboratively with the Denver municipal government on all aspects of the Stapleton redevelopment. The City of Denver will ultimately own and maintain the infrastructure, utilities, and most of the parkland at Stapleton as part of the City systems. In the meantime, the developer has assumed the risk and responsibility inherent in the initial development of Stapleton, making it possible for the new neighborhood to be developed with limited up-front cost to the city.</li>
</ul>

<p align="center">Open space and residential construction at Stapleton</p>

<p>
Relationships with influential leaders in the political, private, and non-profit sectors to provide credibility and clout. Envision Utah, although non-political and non-partisan, has been strategic in establishing relationships with important political and social leaders in the greater Salt Lake City area. Governor Michael Leavitt is an honorary co-chairman of Envision Utah and a chief proponent for the values of the organization. After initially encountering some resistance to its ideas, Envision Utah has worked to build ties with members of the private sector, including prominent real estate developers, and with local non-profit and religious organizations. By convincing important members of the development community that it had popular support, Envision Utah has been able to build a diverse coalition. Envision Utah has also developed partnerships with local officials, in order to support local efforts to adopt and implement the principles articulated by the Quality Growth Strategy.
</p>
<p>
New mechanisms to encourage public participation within a community. The Teton County design charrettes - unprecedented in the community - were established to consider the future of several highways in the county, including State Road WY-390. The charrettes solicit feedback on ways to expand transportation access while reflecting the values of the Teton County community and its neighborhoods, many of which are small and sparsely populated. Teton County sought assistance from outside consultants to stage charrettes that would attract maximum participation and encourage public involvement in planning decisions.
</p>
<p>
Relationships with the media to generate discussion around issues of transportation and land use. In Salt Lake City, Envision Utah strategically involved local media outlets in its efforts to promote the integration of transportation and land use planning. By keeping the media informed of the issues with which it is concerned and by meeting with important members of the local press to argue that issues of growth and sustainability deserve coverage, Envision Utah has been successful in making livability a part of the political and popular discourse in the Greater Wasatch Area.
</p>
<p>
The use of professional partners to help articulate local vision. Teton County has sought professional assistance from planning consultants, including the Urban Land Institute, to assist the county in developing its community-based design charrettes. The use of professionals has helped the county to create planning tools and articulate a long-range vision for the future of transportation and land use in the region. 
</p>
<a name="lev"></a>
<h4 class="orange">LEVERAGING RESOURCES</h4>

At each of the projects visited, the scan team observed the practice of combining funding from a number of sources. The opportunity to mix funds allows the projects to cover issue areas beyond transportation, including housing, economic development, and the environment. In addition to the TCSP Program, sources of funding used in Denver, Salt Lake City, and Teton County include other programs within the U.S. DOT; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; local, county, and state governments; metropolitan and regional planning agencies; and private and public foundations and non-profit organizations. The resources used to support a particular project need not be solely financial; the experience of the projects visited indicates that other factors besides funding - including the local development climate and proximity to other projects - can be leveraged to realize the innovative coordination of transportation planning and land use policy. 

<p>
The following are examples of successful efforts to leverage resources in the four projects visited:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Booming local development to support far-reaching transportation projects. Until the recent economic slow-down, the development environment in downtown Denver was one of fast-paced growth and construction, with many new residential developments opening during the past decade. Downtown Denver, particularly the area known as the LoDo District, has also seen the significant addition of new entertainment uses, including shops, hotels, restaurants, bars, and nightclubs. Since 1995, the Denver Rockies baseball team has played in Coors Field, located in the LoDo District, bringing tens of thousands of people to downtown Denver on game days. This rapid growth has been coupled with strong design and development guidelines established by the municipal government to encourage architectural decisions that promote open space, pedestrian access, and the use of public transit. The significant increase in activity in downtown Denver, combined with local policies to support the use of public transit, have created an auspicious environment for the redevelopment of Denver Union Station as a central transportation facility.</li>
	<li>TCSP funding to contribute to larger projects. The redevelopment of Denver Union Station is a large and expensive project that will be realized over many years. The funding granted to the project by the TCSP Program and other sources provided the resources necessary to begin some preliminary work at the station, giving a much-needed sense of momentum while providing for the construction of innovative elements that can improve mobility in the area and that might otherwise not have been supported. In Teton County, TCSP funding has been used to implement certain components of a long-term transportation plan. The TCSP Program offers support for creative elements of much larger projects, be they planning and design processes or the physical construction of infrastructure.</li>
	<li>Opportunities provided by tourism to generate long-term interest in a program of balanced transportation. The 2002 Olympic Games, held in Salt Lake City and its surrounding region, generated funding for and interest in development projects throughout the Greater Wasatch Area. In particular, the Olympic Games spurred the construction of TRAX - a light-rail system linking the center of Salt Lake City with some of its adjoining communities - in order to transport Olympic spectators easily and without reliance on private automobiles. In the year since the Olympic Games ended, TRAX has been successful in gaining ridership, generating interest in the construction of expanded light-rail infrastructure throughout the Greater Wasatch Area. The Utah Transit Authority has recently expanded TRAX to the Salt Lake City campus of the University of Utah and ultimately hopes to expand the system throughout the region, including to the Salt Lake City airport. Similarly, Teton County is considering an expansion of its own bus system to provide transit service for tourists visiting the ski slopes and national parks. In these ways, the needs of the tourism industry can complement local and regional planning for public transit.</li>
	<li>Larger planning processes to offer possibilities for the coordination of transportation and land use. The efforts of Teton County to develop a process of public design charrettes were generated in part by a countywide comprehensive planning process. These planning efforts also coincided with WYDOT's efforts to implement planned improvements to the state's transportation system. Large- scale public planning efforts, particularly those in conjunction with the development of a comprehensive plan, can lead to interest and enthusiasm in alternative policies for transportation and land use development.</li>
	<li>Private development to complement public projects. Although still in the planning stages, private development will likely play an important role in the future of Denver Union Station. The proposals currently under consideration as part of the master planning process include significant private development components, including retail, office, and hotel uses, in order both to generate funding for the new transportation infrastructure proposed for the station and to support the revitalization of the surrounding neighborhood.</li>
	<li>Market-rate development to support affordable housing. Affordable housing in urban areas is a key component of livability, allowing diverse income groups to reside within reasonable distance of their places of employment, reducing commuting times and increasing the viability of public transit and local retail. In Denver, the residential portion of the Stapleton redevelopment effort includes a Workforce Housing Program in which a minimum of 1,000 units will be reserved for families meeting the local affordability requirements. In Salt Lake City, the downtown residential/retail Gateway development also includes a significant affordability element, with particular apartments being reserved for eligible individuals and families. In both developments, the considerable proportion of affordable units is made possible in part by the presence of market-rate housing, which is used to help offset the costs of the affordable housing. In Teton County, the county government has mandated that all residential developers must offer some affordable housing and that the owners of the three local ski resorts must provide housing for their employees, thereby lessening the demand on the local housing market and helping to maintain residential affordability in the community. Teton County is currently in the process of reviewing its affordable housing policies, in order to determine how best to ensure housing for a diversity of income levels within the county. </li>

<ul>
	<li>Open planning efforts to provide communities with a sense of empowerment. In Teton County, the development of community-based design charrettes has allowed the county to articulate its vision for the future of transportation in the region. TCSP funding allowed the county to hire professionals who reflected the values of the county and could help local leaders and residents to articulate their hopes for roadway design in their community. Each charrette ends with a "pin-up session," in which the design alternatives developed during the charrette can be displayed for public comment and response. These sessions serve not only as a chance to display the results of the charrette, but also as a way to engage the public in issues of design and development and to provide an opportunity for input from residents, business owners, and elected officials. This planning effort has facilitated a sense of empowerment for local residents.</li>

<ul>
	<li>Historic transportation infrastructure to assist with future transportation needs. The community of Stapleton includes an historic freight line, still in use today. The City of Denver and the developers of Stapleton eventually hope to construct an additional rail line, one for passenger use, in the same right-of-way as that used by the existing freight line. This expansion would bring new public transit options into the community and provide additional linkages between Stapleton and downtown Denver.</li>
	<li>Persistence in pursuing funds to finance innovative projects. In addition to the funds provided by the TCSP Program, the projects visited have been the recipients of other grants and funds. Envision Utah has received funding from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Challenge Grant program, as well as from private foundations and religious organizations, while the Denver Union Station program has been successful in obtaining financial support from the regional MPO and from the State of Colorado. The design charrettes in Teton County were supported in part by county funds. Success in receiving and using funding can make it easier to obtain future funding, and the projects visited have found that diligence in pursuing funding for transportation and land use projects can be rewarded.</li>
</ul>
<a name="dem"></a>
<h4 class="orange">DEMONSTRATING RESULTS</h4>

<p>The four projects visited already are demonstrating the results of their efforts in a variety of ways: through new methods of doing business, new partnerships formed, greater community understanding of the relationship between transportation and community preservation, recommendations for changes to policies and practices, and plans for specific implementation projects. In particular, each of the four projects has developed a range of new tools for thinking about and working with the coordination of transportation and land use policies. Stapleton and Envision Utah have also been recognized for the innovativeness of their work, garnering significant national and international commendations.
</p>
<p>The following are examples of successful efforts at demonstrating results from the four projects visited:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Innovative plans to guide community growth. The redevelopment of the Stapleton site is directed by the principles of the Stapleton Development Plan, known as "The Green Book." Developed by a group of civic and community leaders, the Green Book addresses the physical design and development of the area, issues of economic opportunity, environmental responsibility, social equity, and cultural diversity, all within the context of sustainability. Likewise, Teton County hopes to use the outcome of its ongoing community-based charrette process to develop new context-sensitive land use proposals for the county. These proposals could ultimately become countywide regulations.</li>
	<li>Evaluations to gauge the success of planning processes. Following each of the community-based design charrettes, staff members from Teton County provide surveys to the charrette participants - professionals and citizens - to evaluate perceptions of the process. The evaluations are then used to modify future charrettes. Likewise, both Envision Utah and the Denver Union Station project include feedback mechanisms on their websites that allow the public to comment on any aspect of the work of the organizations. </li>
	<li>Technology to keep the public informed of planning developments. The master planning process for Denver Union Station is described in careful detail on a website designed to keep the public abreast of the work underway for the Station. The website includes not only a description of the planning process and a listing of the individuals and organizations involved, but also information on upcoming public meetings, on past meetings, a place for public comments, and a collection of photographs of redeveloped urban train stations in Europe, Asia, and America. In the community of Stapleton, an Intranet will be installed in the neighborhood homes, allowing residents to communicate with each other, to be notified of activities and events within the neighborhood, and to be apprised of the gradual build-out of the area. Envision Utah also uses the Internet to communicate with the public, hosting a website of information about growth and development in the Greater Wasatch Area, about the principles promoted by Envision Utah, and about the members of the organization. Lastly, the official website of Teton County offers information about the community-based design charrettes, including documents produced in past charrettes.</li>
	<li>Sophisticated materials to educate the public about the values of sustainability. The new community of Stapleton will take several decades to reach completion, but the developers of Stapleton are committed to increasing public knowledge about the principles upon which the neighborhood is being constructed. The developer maintains a website about the history and future of Stapleton, and also provides multiple printed documents for interested visitors and researchers. A quarterly newsletter, The Stapleton Front Porch, describes the most recent events in the neighborhood, while other publications cover specific aspects of the redevelopment process. Envision Utah also makes available to the public significant printed and 
web-based materials, including the Envision Utah Implementation Toolbox, a collection of resources on issues such as water conservation, walkable communities, housing needs, and open space. The Toolbox is also used in specialized planning workshops offered by Envision Utah to assist communities with the planning process.</li>
	<li>The use of multiple mechanisms for public participation to increase involvement. The Teton County charrette process, in which citizens and professionals gather together to produce new designs for particular areas of the county, is entirely open to the public. Residents can attend the sessions from beginning to end, or can select individual sessions at which to be present. In addition, the county provides alternative means for area residents to participate in the planning process, including sending comments and concerns directly to the Planning and Development Department by mail and following the progress of the charrettes on the county website.</li>
	<li>Positive public events to promote the results of sustainability. Since 2001, Envision Utah has given annual Quality Growth Awards to members of the community whose work promotes long-term livability in Utah. These awards are presented by Governor Michael Leavitt and honor those communities that are actively engaged in the issues of sustainability. Nineteen projects have been recognized in the past two years.</li>
	<li>Sustainability projects recognized. The Stapleton redevelopment project was honored in 2002 with the international Stockholm Partnerships for Sustainable Cities Award, presented by King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden. That same year, Envision Utah received the Daniel Burnham Award from the American Planning Association in recognition of its efforts to enhance the role of 
planning in the lives of communities.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="orange">CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS</h4>

Through site visits, meetings with local representatives, and research into local activities, the scan team has developed the following conclusions and recommendations based on its visits to Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming. Overall, these conclusions are drawn from observations of methods used by the projects visited in their efforts to reduce the need for future infrastructure investment; to increase mobility, particularly for access to employment; to protect and enhance the human and natural environment; to engage the public in planning decisions; and to improve the efficiency of the local transportation systems. 
<p>
The conclusions and recommendations presented here are divided into two categories: Lessons Learned, which documents the challenges and opportunities encountered by the projects visited, 
and Strategies and Recommendations, which offers ideas and suggestions, to be used at all levels of government, for communities across the United States investigating the interrelationships between transportation planning and land use policies.
</p>
<a name="less"></a>
<h4 class="orange">LESSONS LEARNED</h4>

The four projects visited by the scan team are each experimenting with new methods of planning for transportation infrastructure and for land use regulation. In all, they offer valuable lessons and ideas for other communities facing similar issues.

<ul>
	<li>Planning solutions should be developed and supported locally. Although the projects visited by the scan team share certain regional similarities, the individual methods developed for the coordination of transportation planning and land use policies differ by community. Lessons and best practices can be shared, but ultimately, successful solutions should be the result of local needs and local processes and should respect local values.</li>
	<li>Planning efforts that fail to include sufficient public outreach and participation are unlikely to succeed. A 1997 ballot initiative to expand public transit in Denver was rejected by voters, forcing a comprehensive rethinking of the future of transportation in the Denver area and 
the specific uses of Denver Union Station. Any planning efforts, particularly innovative efforts, that move ahead without sufficient attention to public involvement and concurrence can generate discord and delay implementation. </li>
	<li>Physical design matters as much as good planning. The scan team encountered multiple examples of the importance of high-quality, well-considered physical design in the development of new modes of land use planning. Planning alone is not sufficient to create a successful development, one which integrates transportation and land use in a way that will attract new users and residents. The aesthetic appearance, the ease of use, 
and the connectivity of design are all important factors.</li>
	<li>Available funding sources should be calculated and used in innovative ways in order to most effectively leverage all available resources. The financial needs of a project and the levels of available funding should be tentatively calculated, and then revisited, throughout the planning process. Many multimodal transportation and infrastructure projects are completed in stages, with each component planned and financed independently. Such incremental projects lend themselves to the use of multiple sources of funding, each source dedicated to a different aspect of the project. When used in concert, a variety of funding sources can allow for a project to include innovative elements and to be completed more efficiently than if it depended upon a single source of funding. In order for projects to become a reality, financial plans should be updated as design plans are gradually finalized. </li>
	<li>The local development climate will strongly influence efforts to coordinate transportation and land use planning. To be effective, planning should take into account the realities of the private development environment, including issues of financing, demand, and timing. In Denver, an active market for private development in the downtown area, coupled with municipal design guidelines, has created an atmosphere in which the rehabilitation of Denver Union Station is viable. In Teton County, a recent boom in the construction of vacation homes has put pressure on local transportation infrastructure and the local housing market, stretching the resources of the county and generating interest in long-term regional planning. In these ways, public projects are linked to patterns of private development.</li>
	<li>Ideas should be presented in ways that make sense for a particular community. Creative planning efforts should find ways to present ideas, particularly contentious ideas, in locally acceptable language and context. The political and cultural environment varies by community, and planning projects should use a vocabulary that resonates in the community in which it will be used.</li>
	<li>Innovative planning ideas can move beyond established processes and regulations, requiring old policies to be revised and updated.  New methods of planning and visioning, particularly those that are grounded in community participation, can present a challenge to established planning regulations. Innovative proposals may be stymied in their efforts to move ahead because of existing zoning and transportation policies, which are often geared toward large-lot, low-density, automobile-oriented development. The scan team observed this dynamic in the Utah community of Murray, in which a new plan for a transit-oriented neighborhood has 
been hampered by a traditional zoning code that discourages creative planning solutions. With time, new and innovative planning processes must be integrated into the existing systems of planning in order to maintain the strength of the established planning processes while allowing for new methods to be explored.</li>

<h4 class="orange">STRATEGIES AND APPROACHES</h4>

Observations made during the scan tour identified certain strategies that can be used, at both the local and national levels, to improve transportation planning and preserve and enhance communities. Some common strategies include the meaningful involvement of key stakeholders and community participants; the use of emerging analytic and public involvement techniques to inform decision-making; the consideration of a wide range of community, economic, and environmental impacts throughout the transportation process; and the importance of a close relationship between transportation and community planning.

<ul>
	<li>Transportation planning should include the full participation of all communities and groups impacted by transportation infrastructure.  The construction of transportation infrastructure, whether roadways or public transit, has far-reaching regional implications. Transportation infrastructure connects communities, and for that reason the planning process should be inclusive and holistic. To have equitable results, to support desired patterns of land use, and to promote sustainable economic growth, transportation planning should be conducted as part of a larger regional effort to coordinate transportation with overall land use and development goals.</li>
	<li>Partnerships with non-traditional stakeholders can strengthen planning. These groups - often uninvolved in traditional planning processes - can identify particular aspects of the relationship between transportation and land use that might not be widely recognized and can help to identify needs in the community that are not commonly addressed. Likewise, positive relationships with the local media can be important in raising awareness about issues of livability and growth. </li>
	<li>Creative planning and design concepts should be incorporated into existing planning mechanisms. It is important for the existing institutions of planning to recognize and respond to innovative ideas and methods, providing a means for new ideas to be included in the traditional mechanisms by which projects are identified, designed, and funded. </li>
	<li>Innovative planning needs the support of strong leadership, both individual and institutional. The development and implementation of new planning methods is a challenge, requiring consistent support and promotion from those involved. Strong leadership, both at the individual and institutional levels, is crucial to give momentum and credibility to new ideas.</li>
	<li>Private development can help to support public projects. Private retail and commercial development can provide much-needed revenue for public projects, particularly transportation projects, and can attract the crowds necessary to animate urban spaces and infrastructure. Furthermore, private development projects can also incorporate affordable housing and other important public services, such as supermarkets and drugstores. </li>
	<li>The creation of new planning tools can increase public involvement in the development of transportation and land use policies. Opportunities for "hands-on" work in identifying and solving problems, including techniques such as design charrettes and facilitated discussion groups, can offer an interactive and engaging experience not necessarily provided by a traditional public forum. Computer technology makes it possible for citizens not only to be informed but also to simulate for themselves the effects of different growth alternatives, providing a valuable learning experience by which people can come to better understand the process of planning. These opportunities allow non-professionals to become directly involved in planning for the future of their communities, creating an environment of inclusion and increasing the possibility of a successful outcome.</li>
	<li>Creative planning requires creative funding. Non-transportation funding sources - such as Federal, state, and local government agencies; public and private foundations or non-profit groups; and the private sector - can be used to supplement the financing for transportation projects that have benefits in other areas such as housing, economic development, or the environment. Furthermore, local businesses may be willing to provide not only substantive input but also funding if they believe a project to be beneficial. Grant programs, including the TCSP Program, can support innovative aspects of larger projects, including the development of community-based planning efforts and the implementation of alternative transportation infrastructure.</li>
	<li>Physical design is an important aspect of innovative planning. Innovative projects that result from the better coordination of transportation planning and land use policies - transit-oriented urban development, for example, or the construction of a residential community based on the values of sustainability - require not only comprehensive planning but also attention to physical design. The quality of design matters for the attractiveness of the physical environment but also for the effectiveness, usability, and successful integration of new development.</li>
</ul>

<p align="center">The TRAX system in downtown Salt Lake City</p>

<ul>
	<li>Conscientious evaluation strengthens new planning processes. The identification of indicators of transportation, community, environmental, and economic performance allows for the collection of baseline data and the development of systems to routinely update those data. The ongoing accumulation of data can be used to identify issues and inform people about continuing needs. The planning process itself can be evaluated through periodic assessments, including public surveys. Lastly, the actual outcomes of projects can be measured and compared with projections.</li>
	<li>The ongoing sharing of information supports innovative planning and development ideas. Communities across the country are constantly seeking resources that describe innovative transportation and land use approaches in use in other areas of the country. There is a continuing need for information sharing through case studies, websites, research reports, technical assistance, and site visits.</li>

<h4 class="orange">APPENDIX A</h4>

<h4 class="orange">AMPLIFYING QUESTIONS</h4>

Before embarking on the scan tour, the scan team developed a set of questions to be sent to the representatives with whom the team members would be meeting in each community. The 
questions were designed to guide the representatives in preparing for the visit of the scan team, 
presenting the topics and ideas that the scan team hoped to address during the visit. Among other issues, these amplifying questions covered the successes and challenges faced by each of the communities in their efforts to integrate transportation and land use planning, the outcome of those efforts, the mechanisms for developing partnerships and seeking public participation, and 
the role of government regulations in planning for transportation and land use. The amplifying questions also asked the project representatives to consider the ways in which the scan team could provide assistance and guidance to them.
