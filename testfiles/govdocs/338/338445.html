<P><EM>Re:  1998 Biennial Regulatory Review - Review of the Commission's Broadcast
Ownership Rules and Other Rules Adopted Pursuant to Section 202 of the
Telecommunications Act of 1996.</EM></P>



<P><EM></EM>	The majority of the rules we review today are old.  The National Ownership Cap
rule was first adopted in 1941.  The Newspaper/Broadcast<SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SUP></SUP></SPAN><A HREF="#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Cable/Television Cross-Ownership<SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SUP></SUP></SPAN><A HREF="#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> rules were adopted in the 1970s.  Though some of these rules have been modified slightly over the years, their predicates have remained the same, namely, that
networks and stations enjoy tremendous market power that can lead to anticompetitive
effects.  Moreover, the goals of our structural rules also remain largely unchanged: (1) to
guard against ill-effects in advertising and programming markets, (2) to promote
diversity in programming, and (3) to promote locally-originated content. </P>


<P>Time does not stand still, however, and the highly concentrated video
entertainment, news and information markets of the past, with their attendant limited
programming offerings, have changed dramatically.  Congress' recognition of this
dramatically changed and changing landscape stands behind the Biennial Review process
where we are charged to "determine whether any of such rules are necessary in the public
interest as a result of competition."<SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SUP></SUP></SPAN><A HREF="#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  My dissatisfaction with the present review is its
stubborn refusal to fully consider the competitive landscape today and validate that these
structural rules still serve their stated purposes--particularly in light of significant
evidence that the rules are unnecessary to protect competition (and may even be causing
competitive harm) and that diversity and localism are prospering as a consequence of
new venues and greater capacity available to consumers.  For these reasons, I concur in
part and dissent in part from this <EM>Order</EM>.</P>




<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN>I.	GENERAL CRITIQUE OF STRUCTURAL BROADCAST REGULATIONS</P>


<P>Before turning to my critique of particular rules, I first will sketch the breadth of
change that should compel a more fulsome review of the rules than is represented by this
Biennial Review.  Second, I will generally outline the government's stated interest in
these rules and challenge some of their underpinnings in light of the dramatically altered
video landscape.</P>



<P><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">The Video Marketplace: Take the Mask off the Old Lone Ranger</SPAN></EM></P>


<P>	"Return with us now to those thrilling days of yesteryear."<SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SUP></SUP></SPAN><A HREF="#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>
<P>  A time when there
were three television networks that dominated the land (NBC, CBS and ABC).  A time
when there were only six television stations.  A time before cable television, before direct
broadcast satellite (DBS), before VCRs, before the Internet.  It was a time of highly
concentrated video markets in which only one medium--television--reigned.  It was a
time of nascent video advertising markets, and of very limited program sources.  In this
era, there were few around to curtail the power of these rustlers.  There was only one
Lone Ranger to discipline the dominance of the "Network Gang of Three."  But "who
was that masked man?" "A fiery horse with the speed of light, a cloud of dust and a
hearty 'Hi-Yo Silver.'"  The FCC! </P>


<P>	Today, over fifty years after <EM>The Lone Ranger</EM> television show filled the bubbled
screens of our black and white sets, the Lone Ranger rides again in an episode entitled
<EM>The 1998 Biennial Regulatory Review of the Commission's Broadcast Ownership Rules.</EM> 
So much has changed since the days that Tootsie Roll, "America's favorite candy," and
General Mills brought to Americans the Ranger and his companion Tonto.  Yet, the
nostalgic FCC Ranger cannot bring itself to take full cognizance of this change and face
whether it is time to retire the mask and let other forces do the job.  Instead, we continue
to sprint ahead kicking these rules forward, while being chased by a growing multitude
(of new media, of economic change, of logic).</P>


<P>By any measure, the market, and thus the foundation of the FCC's structural
ownership rules, has changed dramatically in ways that should lessen the dangers we
purport to address that are associated with market dominance.  The actor Clayton Moore
starred in <EM>The Lone Ranger</EM> television series from 1949 to 1956.  Mr. Moore passed away
just last year, and in his name I couch my argument for a more thorough examination. 
Simply put, there is <EM>MORE</EM>, more of everything: </P>


<P><EM>MORE Broadcast Networ</EM>ks: In the 1940s and 1950s there were only three
networks (NBC, CBS and ABC).  Today, those three are joined by Fox, WB,
UPN, and PAX to yield seven networks competing for programming and
advertising dollars.</P>


<P><EM>MORE Broadcast Stations</EM>: Most households live in a television market served by
eleven or more local stations.  In 1946 there were only six stations nationwide.<SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SUP></SUP></SPAN><A HREF="#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>
<P> 
Today there are over 1,600.<SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SUP></SUP></SPAN><A HREF="#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>


<P><EM>MORE Video Outlets</EM>: Today approximately 81 percent of all Americans
subscribe to either cable, DBS, or another multi-channel service provider, rather
than receive their signal free and over the air.<SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SUP></SUP></SPAN><A HREF="#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN>  That is, the invention and
ubiquitous deployment of cable and DBS services have given advertisers,
programmers and Americans substantial alternatives to broadcast.  These systems
offer viewers a plethora of options unimagined when many of the rules reviewed
in the <EM>Order </EM>were adopted.  The average cable subscriber has 54 channels
available to him.<SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SUP></SUP></SPAN><A HREF="#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>
<P>  The average DBS subscriber has hundreds of channels
available to her.<SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SUP></SUP></SPAN><A HREF="#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>
<P>  Additionally, 50% of Americans have access to the Internet.<SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SUP></SUP></SPAN><A HREF="#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>

<P>Moreover, the ubiquity of VCRs, DVD players and other video medium offer
consumers additional entertainment, news and information sources.  And, more
recently the Internet is adding yet another.  Most importantly, there is no end in
sight to this trend.</P>


<P><EM>MORE Programming</EM>: There are more sources of programming than any time in
history.  There are 170 cable networks and seven broadcast networks.<SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SUP></SUP></SPAN><A HREF="#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>
<P>  The
programs are also more diverse than in the "golden age of television," when
Americans sat around watching the same basic shows.  It was inconceivable in
days of old that there would be channels dedicated to news 24 hours a day like
CNN or Fox News.  Or, that there would be channels dedicated not only to sports,
like ESPN, but single sports like the Golf Channel.  Or, that hundreds of movie
channels would be available on their televisions, many on demand, with hundreds
more titles in their local video store.  Even on pure broadcast stations, there are
more sports, movies, drama, and national and local news than at any time
previously.</P>


<P>	With so much more in the market, one can expect to find more competition and
more diversity.  Advertisers have many more choices to display their products.  And,
consumers have many more options to choose from as sources for entertainment,
information, and news.  If, as I believe, the good and plenty of outlets and programming
is fertile ground for a healthy marketplace, there is clear reason to question why such
forces (where consumers and producers interact) will not produce competitive prices,
competitive opportunities for programming, and robust options for viewers.  Yet, the
Commission continues to place unsupportable faith in the concept that such things can
only happen by government fiat and not by the natural forces of the market.</P>



<P><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">To Question the Rules is not to Question the Venerable Goals of Broadcast Regulation</SPAN></EM></P>


<P>	The goals of our broadcasting rules are laudable.  They seek: (1) to constrain
undue economic power, (2) to promote diversity and (3) to promote locally originated
programming.  There may have been a time in which such objectives could not be
achieved without regulatory intervention (though I question it).  But, surely these values
are not incompatible with market forces, or market failures in the classic sense.  Thus,
one does not abandon these objectives by calling on the Commission to consider if the
rules are necessary at all or in their present form, particularly in the face of substantial
evidence that they are unsupported by the facts, and that they may actually in some
instances harm producers, suppliers and consumers.   For an outstanding overview of the
current market conditions and public harms being caused by some of our structural rules,
I would direct the reader to <EM>Old Rules and New Rivals: An Examination of Broadcast
Television Regulation and Competition</EM>,<SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SUP></SUP></SPAN><A HREF="#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN> by Michael L. Katz, which is included in the
record of this proceeding.</P>


<P>	<EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Broadcast Economic Power in the Video Market</SPAN></EM></P>


<P>	Video producers make money by inducing viewers to watch their products.  If one
follows the broadcast model, the product is free to viewers and revenue is generated
through advertising.  The game here is to get the most eyeballs you can, regardless of the
type of program.  Where one can charge for subscribers, as can cable, DBS and MMDS,
you can make money both through advertising and by inducing viewers to pay for
programming.  </P>


<P>If the video market was highly concentrated, leaving few avenues to reach
audiences, that unquestionably could result in harm.  For instance, as is assumed by many
of our broadcast structural rules, if a broadcaster enjoyed undue market power it could
theoretically raise advertising rates to non-competitive, monopolistic levels, thereby
harming advertisers.  Similarly, if broadcasters (individually or collectively) could
monopolize audiences they could harm suppliers of programming by demanding
uneconomically low program prices.</P>


<P>	Yet, again, if one notes the dramatic change in the market (which the majority
only does superficially) one can see how questionable many of the suppositions are that
undergird our ownership rules.  For example, television networks have lost a substantial
share of the national viewing audience.  Between 1952 and 1991, the prime time ratings
of the three major networks fell from 75 to 37.5, and by 1998 had fallen another 25
percent to 28.3 percent.<SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SUP></SUP></SPAN><A HREF="#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>
<P>  Are today's broadcast shares large enough to allow
broadcasters to unilaterally raise advertising rates without constraint?  This is just one
question that deserves review if we wish to continue to justify ownership restraints on
our fear of the impact on advertising markets.<SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SUP></SUP></SPAN><A HREF="#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A>


<P>	Additionally, there has been an explosion of media outlets to which both
advertisers and programmers may turn, lessening the ability and incentives of
broadcasters to unilaterally dictate rates.  With regard to cable service, 67 percent of all
Americans subscribe to this medium and nearly 97 percent have cable available.<SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SUP></SUP></SPAN><A HREF="#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>
<P> 
Another 12.5 percent subscribe to DBS, which is virtually available to 100% of
Americans within the continental U.S.<SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SUP></SUP></SPAN><A HREF="#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A>  Consequently, advertisers now have other
options from which to choose in reaching a national audience.  In the vernacular of
antitrust, there are substitutes.  If a network or station owner attempted to extract
monopoly rents, advertisers would have other options for reaching consumers. 
Moreover, other medium may prove more attractive to advertisers who can more
carefully tailor their messages to particular demographics on media like cable or DBS. 
At a minimum, there is reason to question the blind assumption that advertisers would be
harmed without the protections of our ownership rules, given the increased availability of
other outlets. </P>


<P>	The proliferation of other distribution outlets has also constrained broadcast
program purchasers from depressing the prices program suppliers get.  In fact, with more
outlets, high quality programming can "shop" for the highest rents.  This explains the
trend we see toward cable and DBS capturing marquee programming such as sporting
events, top movies and increasingly major news, history, public affairs, and arts
programming.  Indeed, contrary to what should be predicted if network concentration
were substantial, programmers are able to command a premium for shows like <EM>E.R.,<SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SUP></SUP></EM></SPAN><EM></EM><A HREF="#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A>

<P>NFL<EM> </EM>Football,<SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SUP></SUP></SPAN><A HREF="#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A>
<P><EM></EM> and NHL Hockey.<SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SUP></SUP></SPAN><A HREF="#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A>
<P>  In short, it is hard to defend the assumption that
broadcasters have sufficient market power to command monopoly rents for
advertisements or to deflate prices for programming.  Surely, one sees no evidence to
justify a standing structural rule, rather than rely on antitrust enforcement.</P>



<P><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Diversity in the Market</SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN> </P>


<P>	Diversity is also an admirable goal, yet, it is an elusive concept.  It has come to
mean many things.  Limiting ownership concentration does one obvious thing; it
increases or maintains the number of different owners.  Limiting ownership and allowing
more owners has three primary diversity effects: For one, there are more broadcast
properties and more ownership opportunities available for more people.  Protecting
opportunity is one way of promoting minority and female ownership.  This is sometimes
called "source diversity."<SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SUP></SUP></SPAN><A HREF="#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A>
<P>  I will not discuss this point in this statement.  Second, more
owners might mean more from which to choose.  Viewers will be able to see the different
programming choices of different owners, and it is hoped that these programs will vary in
content and style.  This is what we often call "program diversity."  The third point is a
subtle variation on the second.  Proponents often urge rules to promote not just different
program genres or styles to capture viewer interest, but different "viewpoints."  That is,
by the fact that owners are different people or institutions, one might expect to see
different perspectives that are "antagonistic" to those of other programmers.  Let me first
make some general observations about the number of distinct program choices available
to consumers.</P>


<P>	It is said, "beauty is in the eye of the beholder."<SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SUP></SUP></SPAN><A HREF="#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A>
<P>  The same could be said for
television.  It is difficult and perhaps constitutionally impermissible for government to
impose its conception of worthiness or beauty on viewers.<SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SUP></SUP></SPAN><A HREF="#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A>
<P>  Yet, it is understandable to
craft rules that promote the widest swath of programming choice to match the infinite
variety of interests of the American consumer.  Whether your taste runs to WWF
wrestling (perhaps the most popular programming on television today), the symphony,
sports, comedy, news, drama, feature film, cartoons, music videos, history, public affairs,
or shopping, the video marketplace has more of it, in more colors and flavors, than ever
before.</P>


<P>	To make my point I highlight a powerful and persistent trend in
programming--movement from broadcasting to narrowcasting.  In the early period of
television, broadcasting was the primary means of receiving video content (excluding the
movie theatre).  Broadcast is a medium that provides one signal to many people.  That is
its central virtue, but also its central limitation.  Because it can only serve up one
program at any given moment in time, it has to find a program that appeals to the
broadest possible audience.  This is particularly the case since broadcasting is solely
advertiser supported.  Thus, almost by its nature, broadcast has trouble being
diverse--that is, serving a more narrow, particularized community of interest is difficult,
both in technical terms (the signal goes everywhere) and in economic terms (to remain
viable a station must maximize eyeballs, <EM>i.e</EM>, aggregate interests).  When broadcasting
dominated video programming the challenges of program diversity were quite acute. </P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN>Cable, and later DBS, brought to the marketplace a new medium that had
characteristics that clearly enhanced program diversity and choice.  A cable system offers
subscribers multiple channels.  A subscriber that hungers for sports might watch a
channel dedicated to that genre (<EM>e.g</EM>., ESPN, Fox Sports).  A history buff the same (<EM>e.g</EM>,
History Channel).  A movie fanatic the same (<EM>e.g</EM>., HBO, Showtime, Cinemax).  A news
and public affairs junkie the same (<EM>e.g., </EM>CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, C-Span), and WWF
fans can watch all day and night to their hearts content.  A system operator can offer this
diverse programming economically because he draws both from advertising and
subscription revenue.  Subscription fees also allow a program producer to gauge a
viewer's preference.  Programs that are strongly desired are more valuable and thus more
can be charged.  (This is why there are tiers and programming packages offered.) 
Additionally, the technical nature of the system allows for this variety.  Because cable is
not hindered by interference problems, like broadcasters, the system can be upgraded
continually to increase capacity and thus provide more channels.<SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SUP></SUP></SPAN><A HREF="#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A>
<P>  The importance of
cable, DBS and other systems is not just to increase video competition.  These mediums
also have ushered in greater diversity, for they can program to distinct parochial interest
on a daily basis in a manner that is challenging for broadcasting.  The ability to program
to a wider variety of interests is what, in part, accounts for the fact that the majority of
Americans (nearly 80 percent) subscribe to some multichannel service.</P>


<P>Of late, the trend toward tailored programming is getting finer with the advent of
digitalization and the Internet.  Perhaps the penultimate expression of diversity is the
ability to program for a single individual's unique interest.  The video landscape is
moving in this direction.  On the Internet one clearly sees the trend: "My Yahoo" and 
"My AOL" for example.  Products like WebTV, AOL TV, Geocast, and <A HREF="mailto:Excite@Home"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Excite@Home</SPAN></A>,
all promise to enhance traditional television product with personalized, tailored content. 
These trends show clearly that the breadth of unique and different programming has
exploded and is growing exponentially.  Under the weight of such trends, I cannot begin
to see how one can claim the loss or fear of loss of diverse programs and choices for
consumers.</SPAN></P>






<P><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Viewpoint Diversity</SPAN></EM></SPAN></P>


<P>The strongest proponents of diversity in programming will insist that it is not
multiple, different choices that matter, but "viewpoint diversity."  Given the facts of the
marketplace, I believe this to really be the crux of the government's purported diversity
interest.  The goal is not simply to provide choices that appeal to diverse interests.  The
proponents want shows that are "antagonistic to each other."</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SUP></SUP></SPAN><A HREF="#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A>
<P>  The first problem with
this conception is that it is unclear that a market that produces programming that serves
the interests of a broad and varied audience does not also represent a sufficient number of
"viewpoints" from which consumers can choose.  </SPAN></P>


<P>Secondly, I question what the concept means for the vast majority of programs
consumers watch.  Is NBC's <EM>Friends</EM> antagonistic to WB's <EM>Dawson's Creek?</EM>  Is ABC's
<EM>Who Wants to be a Millionaire</EM> antagonistic to CBS' <EM>Touched by an Angel</EM>?  Or, is ABC's
<EM>Monday Night Football</EM> antagonistic to Fox's <EM>Football Sunday</EM>?  It's hard to see the
relevance of this concept.  Perhaps, the viewpoint interest is reserved for public affairs
and news programs, where issues might be presented and debated.  But, here, too, one
questions its meaning.  Local news programs rarely editorialize, or pick political
candidates, or take stands on major issues such as abortion or gun control.  The reason is
simple enough: because consumers do not pay to watch, broadcasters make money by
reaching the largest possible audience.  They rarely take the kind of risks that might
endear them to some in the viewing area and raise the ire of others.  They are not in the
"antagonizing" business.  Moreover, I am not sure why we are certain "antagonistic"
programs do not sell.  I see plenty of evidence of opinionated programming:  <EM>Crossfire</EM>, 
<EM>Face the Nation</EM>, <EM>Hardball</EM>, <EM>Larry King Live</EM>, and why not <EM>Jerry Springer</EM>, for examples. 
Are we to believe all of this would vanish absent our structural ownership rules?</SPAN></P>


<P>I also fail to see how ownership restrictions in themselves do much to promote
the goal of antagonism.  Different owners may have different perspectives, but they
probably have more in common as commercial interests than not, for each must compete
for maximum audience share to remain profitable.  Moreover, the ownership class may
include different people, but it is hard to see how that ensures that they are different in
their viewpoints.  We do not and could not possibly insist there be Republican owners
and Democratic owners, pro-gun and anti-gun owners, etc.  I would suggest some amount
of "antagonism" sells.  Controversy and conflict are the stuff of good story.  If different
viewpoints are to be found, I think they will be the products of the commercial market
much more than by our rules and our adherence to the high-brow ideal we used to defend
them. </SPAN></P>



<P><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Localism</SPAN></EM></SPAN></P>


<P>Finally, I would like to say a brief word about localism, which is often subtly
distinguished from diversity in general.  The principle is that the government favors
locally originated programming because that is the programming most likely to serve the
interests of those viewers and listeners in the community of the licensed station.  The
majority of stations are affiliated with a national network.  Because the broadcasting
business seeks to maximize viewers, there has always been concern that a powerful
network would force local stations to carry their national program, theoretically to the
detriment of local viewers and local interests.  For decades, the Commission has pursued
rules intended to ensure networks do not dominate local stations and their programming
preferences.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SUP></SUP></SPAN><A HREF="#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A>
<P> </SPAN></P>


<P>One central failing of regulations intended to promote localism is that they
assume that such programming would not flower if networks and stations were too large. 
One is hard pressed, however, to see why, in a healthy marketplace, if the public values
local programming, producers would not supply it.  If a local audience desires a program,
and is willing to watch the program, that program will attract advertising dollars and thus
a station or network will have an incentive to produce and provide that show.  Indeed,
since most consumers purchase advertised product in their local towns and communities,
advertisers--even national ones with local franchises--would favor programs that appeal
to local audiences.  </SPAN></P>


<P>I remain struck how often we simply assume that such programming will vanish
if we do not require it.  Of course, if consumers do not want certain kinds of local
programming and it is not provided as a consequence, there is no justification for the
government to compel it.  Where government attempts to promote the messages and
images that it prefers, even where consumers themselves do not, we are no longer in
America and the First Amendment has been abandoned.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SUP></SUP></SPAN><A HREF="#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A>

<P></SPAN>	</SPAN></P>


<P>II.	CRITIQUE OF THE BIENNIAL REVIEW</SPAN></P>


<P>I will now turn and address the specifics of today's <EM>Order</EM>. The Commission has
taken steps today to modify some of its broadcast ownership rules in an attempt to make
our regulations more consistent with current marketplace conditions.  While I support
these steps, I believe they are too limited in scope and reflect a continuing reluctance to
examine in a meaningful way the legacy of our broadcast regulations.  As a result, I
concur in part and dissent in part to the <EM>Order </EM>released today.  I will address the rules to
which I dissent or concur below. </SPAN></P>


<P>Before doing so, I wish to state my approach to the Biennial Review of structural
ownership rules.  Since our charge is to examine whether a rule continues to serve the
public interest in light of competition, I feel it imperative to always fully examine the
state of the video market--market share, number of competitors, competitive effects,
ease of entry and inefficiencies--and challenge the continued validity of prophylactic
ownership rules in light of this examination.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SUP></SUP></SPAN><A HREF="#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A>
<P>  I believe the clear bent of the biennial
review process set out by Congress is deregulatory, in recognition of the pace of dramatic
change in the marketplace and the understanding that healthy markets can adequately
advance the government's interests in competition and diversity.  Thus, contrary to the
approach of the majority, I start with the proposition that the rules are no longer
necessary and demand that the Commission justify their continued validity.  Against that
backdrop, I turn to today's decision.</SPAN></P>



<P>	<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">National Television Ownership Rule and UHF Discount</SPAN></SPAN></P>


<P>I respectfully dissent from the majority's conclusion that, based on the record
before us, the national ownership cap still serves the public interest.  The <EM>Order </EM>contains
no meaningful examination of the market or the state of competition, a glaring omission
given Section 202(h)'s directive to consider whether competition obviates the need for
such rules.  This is particularly disturbing, since serious questions have been raised (but
not adequately addressed) as to whether this rule is substantially related to the stated
government interests of protecting local competition and promoting local diversity, and
evidence has been presented that the rule may actually cause harm to the public interest.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SUP></SUP></SPAN><A HREF="#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A>


<P></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></SPAN>In the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, we asked for comment on the effect of the
rule on competition in the national advertising and program production markets.  We also
asked about the effect of the rule on existing television networks and the formation of
new networks.  These points of inquiry go to issues of competition in the national
markets.  One would expect to see an examination of market concentration, advertising
and programming price effects, etc.   The <EM>Order</EM>, however, lacks any meaningful
discussion of either of the national markets or the formation of new networks.  If it had, it
would have noted the substantial change that has occurred offering greater competitive
discipline and substantially increased diversity.  <EM>See</EM> Section I, <EM>supra</EM>.</SPAN></P>


<P>Instead, the <EM>Order </EM>validates the rule on two other grounds: It states that (1)
additional time is needed to assess the impact of the local ownership rule changes made
last August;</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SUP></SUP></SPAN><A HREF="#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A>
<P> and (2) expresses concern about the growing number of large group owners
and the potential for disruptive restructuring.  None of these articulated reasons address
the national programming or advertising markets, or the rules' impact on new or existing
networks.  </SPAN></P>


<P>Indeed, the justifications appear to focus almost exclusively on competition and
diversity at the <EM>local</EM> level.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SUP></SUP></SPAN><A HREF="#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A>
<P>  It is not intuitive why national ownership restrictions have
any meaningful impact on local competition or local diversity.  We have very detailed
rules limiting the number of stations one may own in a given local market.  Thus, no
matter how many stations one owns nationally, he cannot increase concentration in the
local market, by operation of our local ownership rules.  Indeed, these rules were
modified less than a year ago to reflect our present views on local competition and
diversity.  Consequently, I fail to see the relationship between the national cap and the
stated government interest in local competition and diversity.  Further, the <EM>Order</EM> does
not offer a meaningful explanation.  I would note that on many previous occasions the
Commission has itself squarely expressed doubt about the linkage between the national
cap and its stated goals.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SUP></SUP></SPAN><A HREF="#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A>


<P></SPAN>Not only are the stated rationales for retaining the rule in its current form not
persuasive, but the <EM>Order</EM> lacks any meaningful discussion of the potential harms posed
by the rule.  For example, the study completed by Professor Michael Katz raises the
possibility of some non-trivial harms associated with this rule.  The study finds that the
rule: (1) limits economies of scale associated with common ownership, thus raising costs
and reducing incentives to invest in over the air television; (2) blocks the expansion of
particularly well-run station groups; and (3) limits the ability of broadcast networks to
own stations, an arrangement that would improve coordination and lower the risks
associated with investing in high-quality, innovative programming.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SUP></SUP></SPAN><A HREF="#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A>
<P>   These harms are
not small concerns to an industry in the midst of remaking itself in digital form and for
whom every day the number of competitors increases while total viewership declines. </SPAN></P>


<P>These concerns are also strikingly similar to those raised by the Commission in its
decision to modify the Dual Network Rule.  In the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in
that proceeding, also issued today, the Commission reviews with some specificity the
current economies of the network broadcasting market.  As noted in the <EM>NPRM</EM>, networks
are in the business of producing mass audiences, and the size of that audience is facing
continuing erosion from cable and DBS.  The <EM>NPRM</EM> finds that in order for networks to
be economically viable they must be "larger rather than smaller as measured in terms of
affiliated stations and the viewers produced and sold to advertisers."</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SUP></SUP></SPAN><A HREF="#N_33_"><SUP> (33)</SUP></A>
<P>  In the dual
network context, the Commission finds that contract negotiations between program
producers and networks are extremely complex and, as a result, the costs of these
contracts are high.  Integration allows for lower costs and better allocation of risks.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SUP></SUP></SPAN><A HREF="#N_34_"><SUP> (34)</SUP></A>
<P>  
The NPRM also points to the amount of integration that has occurred in this market after
the repeal of our financial interest and syndicated exclusivity rules (fin/syn) as reflective
of the difficulty in negotiating contracts.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SUP></SUP></SPAN><A HREF="#N_35_"><SUP> (35)</SUP></A>


<P></SPAN>I would argue that these same economic costs and efficiencies accrue to a
network's affiliate relationships as well.  Contract negotiations between networks and
affiliates are also complex and the costs high.  And as in the case of the fin/syn rules, I
would point to the number of networks that are either closing in or at the cap as evidence
of the difficulty and costs associated with contracting with affiliates.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SUP></SUP></SPAN><A HREF="#N_36_"><SUP> (36)</SUP></A>  For those
companies that are at the cap, these costs are a direct result of our rules.  But the <EM>Order</EM>
not only fails to analyze these costs, but also whether the costs associated with the rule
are justified on the basis of our interest in preserving competition in the national
programming or advertising markets, or even competition or diversity at the local level. </SPAN></P>


<P>The <EM>Order</EM> also states that a change in the cap may well influence the bargaining
positions between broadcast television networks and their affiliates, and that we should
proceed cautiously, particularly given the restructuring that may be taking place
concurrently on the local level.  However, we do not have evidence of a massive
restructuring taking place at the local level.  Only 42 applications for duopolies in local
markets have been filed since we modified our local ownership rules, and 19 of those
reflect purchases of television stations that the buyer already programs through local
marketing or time brokerage agreements.   And, while I am sensitive to the shifts
currently taking place in the network/affiliate relationship, I am unconvinced that these
concerns necessarily implicate issues of diversity and competition at the local level. 
Protecting one group of station owners over another for its own sake is not a valid
function of government.  Nonetheless, I would have liked to hear much more about the
impact on local stations and how that impact undermines the public interest in an NPRM
that would more comprehensively examine the 35 percent audience reach cap.</SPAN></P>


<P>In short, the Commission's decision is deficient in several ways.  It fails to fully
examine the video market and consider the changes in that market.  It merely assumes a
valid link between a national limit and local competition and diversity, despite fairly
substantial evidence to the contrary.  And, it fails to consider the public interest harms
that may flow from the rule.  I believe there is more than enough on the record of this
proceeding to call into question whether the public is being served by the 35 percent
audience reach cap, and I would have supported a Notice to examine more thoroughly the
possibility of its modification or repeal.  Further, I support the Commission's decision
not to amend the UHF discount.  Any action on the discount should be considered in
conjunction with a thorough analysis of the cap.</SPAN></P>


<P> </SPAN></P>

<P>	<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Newspaper/Broadcast Cross-Ownership Rule</SPAN></SPAN></P>


<P>	I also must respectfully dissent from the majority's conclusion that the
newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule continues to serve the public interest.  While I
welcome the decision to issue an <EM>NPRM</EM> to look at the impact of the rule in particular
circumstances, I am disappointed that the Commission appears unwilling to engage in a
broader debate about the continuing validity of this 25-year-old rule, which has never
been modified.  This rule raises significant First Amendment concerns, and, as a result,
requires rigorous analysis in support of its continuing validity.  To my mind, the <EM>Order</EM>
falls short of that bar, and I cannot conclude that the rule continues to serve the public
interest as a result of competition.</SPAN></P>


<P>	As I predicted in my separate statement to the <EM>NOI</EM>, the pivotal issues in this
entire proceeding evolve around the issue of diversity.  Nowhere is this more the case
than in the analysis surrounding the newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule.  With
respect to this rule, the Commission relies heavily on its goal of promoting "viewpoint
diversity," which looks specifically at the amount of "local" programming in a market. 
While the <EM>Order </EM>considers the effect of the rule on competition, it limits its discussion to
whether meaningful efficiencies derive from existing combinations.  A more thorough
competitive analysis would also discuss, for example, the relationship between the
advertising markets for broadcasting and newspapers and the substitutability of the
television and newspaper products.  If they are the same products, then the Commission
should justify its decision to permit television duopolies but not newspaper/television
combinations in local markets.  If they are different products, then the Commission
should justify why it will continue to apply a complete ban on cross-ownership between
the mediums, based simply on their character.</SPAN></P>


<P>	The heart of the newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule is the Commission's
belief that these two mediums are the only two suited to providing content oriented
toward the local community.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SUP></SUP></SPAN><A HREF="#N_37_"><SUP> (37)</SUP></A>  This <EM>Order</EM> retains that thesis by rejecting the proposition
that the explosion in alternate sources of programming obviates the need for the rule.  It
finds that: (1) "new outlets" (DBS/MMDS) are not substitutes for newspapers or
broadcasters on the local level; and (2) that cable is a poor substitute because it is not
required by law to provide locally originated content, even though some systems do.  By
contrast, the<EM> Order</EM> places faith in broadcasting, because broadcasters are required,
pursuant to their public interest obligations, to provide programming responsive to the
needs of the local community, and newspapers, even though they are not required to,
typically cover local issues.  From these observations, the <EM>Order </EM>concludes that broadcast
television and newspapers continue to be the dominant source of local news and public
affairs information in any given market.  Let me address each of these two propositions.</SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN>	As configured today, it is true that most satellite and wireless based video
providers offer primarily national programming.  The central reason for this is technical. 
Satellite technology has had difficulty beaming unique programming into local
communities from hundreds of miles in space.  The technology is changing, however,
and with spot beam technology DBS providers are pursuing localized carriage.  Indeed,
they fought aggressively to modify the Satellite Home Viewer Act to allow them to carry
local broadcast signals, feeling that it was a competitive disadvantage not to have local
content.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SUP></SUP></SPAN><A HREF="#N_38_"><SUP> (38)</SUP></A> Some companies appear to be pursuing a satellite service that would include
multiple channels of tailored 24 hour local programming, including weather, sports,
traffic, arts and community affairs.  Thus,  as competition increases in providing national
programming content (broadcast, cable, DBS, MMDS, Internet) carriers will naturally
push into local content to differentiate their offerings.  It is clear, in my view, that content
as an important competitive offering.  So, while I would concede that these services
provide limited local programming today, it is clear that video competition is driving
them to provide localized content and they should not be dismissed as viable alternatives
out of hand.</SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN>	The majority's rejection of cable as a viable medium for local content is more
baffling.  The fact is that many cable systems are offering local programming, perhaps
for more concentrated periods than broadcast television.  News Channel 8 in our own
area offers just one example.  Cablevision's New York Metro service offering local
news, weather, traffic, sports and community affairs is another.  Most cable systems offer
community PEG channels.  Many systems offer local high school sports, such as the
Home Team Sports channel.  HTS is apparently valuable enough to consumers that it
costs extra to have access to it.  Moreover, cable systems are operated locally, just as
stations are, and I see no real impediment to them offering local services if their
community wishes to have them.  In fact, local cable systems are regulated by local
franchises that often extract local community services as a condition of receiving a local
franchise.  Broadcast stations have no local regulatory oversight.  Despite all of this, the
Commission turns a blind eye, refusing to survey the breadth of local cable programming
and dismissing the argument by holding that because federal law does not mandate local
content, we cannot count on such systems providing it.</SPAN></P>


<P></SPAN>	The Commission, however, repeats the same error I note in Section I.  It seems
unwilling to recognize that localism sells.  There are a bevy of commercial motivations
for offering such fare: advertisers want to target groups with similar demographics and
interests.  National programmers want to differentiate their products.  Multichannel
systems want to increase the value of subscription fees.  I find it a bit remarkable we will
not look to or credit competitive content, where there is not a regulation compelling it,
when reviewing the market to see if competition has obviated the need for a regulation! 
Moreover, the <EM>Order</EM> refuses to consider local content in cable systems, because it is not
required, but in direct contradiction is unobstructed in crediting regulation-free local
newspaper coverage because that medium "typically" covers local issues.  This is
unquestionably arbitrary analysis. </SPAN></P>


<P>	In defending this rule, the Commission again trumpets the value of "antagonistic
voices," or "viewpoint diversity."  I question generally some aspects of this
governmental interest, which I discussed more fully in Section I.  I would only add a few
points.  For one, I do not see how one can demonstrate that newspapers, by their very
nature, are antagonistic to broadcasters and, thus, their combination would frustrate our
stated goal.  I have not observed or been shown any particular give and take between
these two mediums.  I don't believe we have even genuinely examined this proposition. 
Surely, one can hypothesize that if a local paper and local station combined, there may be
some homogenization of news and information.  But, one can equally imagine that the
combined resources may allow for greater and more efficient coverage of local events
that could not be covered by the two individually. (There is some evidence of this where
certain combinations have been grandfathered).  Second, I would note that a broadcast
station is the most likely candidate to take views antagonistic to another station, since
they directly compete for audience share.  Yet, we allow a single entity to own two
broadcast stations in many markets, if enough "voices" remain in the market.  I do not
see why newspaper/broadcast combinations could not be regulated the same way.  </SPAN></P>


<P></SPAN>	Based on the above considerations, I cannot support the conclusion that the
newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership restrictions continue to serve the public.  I would
support a proceeding that would look critically at how the significant and far reaching
changes in the video marketplace since 1975 have eviscerated the need for what is an
extremely prohibitive regulation.</SPAN></P>



<P></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">The Cable/Broadcast Cross-Ownership Rule</SPAN></EM></SPAN></P>


<P><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>I also dissent from the <EM>Order's </EM>decision to retain the Cable/Broadcast
Cross-Ownership rule.  The rule is 30 years old, and, as in the case of the rules
discussed above, I believe there have been sweeping and pervasive changes in the
local video programming market that warrant a more critical analysis of the
benefits associated with this rule than has been undertaken in the context of the
instant <EM>NOI</EM>.  I believe that many of the harms, such as channel positioning,
asserted in the context of this rule may be adequately addressed by other rules the
Commission regularly enforces.  For example, I would observe that even if one
were concerned that cable might have an incentive in favoring its own local
station on its cable system, the "must carry" rules would largely deny it the ability
to do so.</SPAN></P>


<P>Finally, I find it ironic that the majority is concerned that it will lose an
"antagonistic voice" if a local cable system is co-owned with a broadcast station,
but is unwilling to count that same voice as viable in the broadcast/newspaper
cross-ownership context.  For all of the above reasons, I would have supported a
rulemaking to more adequately and thoroughly examine whether this rule is still
necessary to promote the public's interest.  </P>



<P></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">The Dual Network Rule</SPAN></SPAN></P>


<P>	I concur in the <EM>Order's</EM> conclusion that the Dual Network Rule as it applies to
UPN and the WB may no longer serve the public interest and the decision to issue an
<EM>NPRM</EM> to evaluate possible modifications to the rule.  While I would support an <EM>NPRM
</EM>that would also consider repeal of the current rule as it applies to the top four networks, I
believe that the record supports this more limited <EM>NPRM</EM> as an adequate first step.  I look
forward, however, to continuing to review this rule in our upcoming biennial reviews.</SPAN></P>



<P>	<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Local Radio Ownership</SPAN></SPAN></P>


<P>	I also concur in the decision today to retain the current local radio ownership
rules.  However, I am unconvinced that the further proceeding contemplated by the
<EM>Order</EM> is warranted, nor do I believe, as a general matter, that consolidation in the
industry has threatened local competition and diversity in a manner inconsistent with the
intent of Congress. </SPAN></P>


<P>The <EM>Order </EM>contemplates a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to address
several radio market issues.  One issue is how to harmonize the counting methods we use
to determine both the size of the market and the number of stations in the market that
count toward the cap.  To the extent that this NPRM addresses what may be an arbitrary
distinction between counting methods, I support its issuance.  </SPAN></P>


<P>The NPRM will also ask whether the Commission should adopt a different (and
more restrictive) method for determining the relevant "market" because our current
definition may be "producing unintended results that are contrary to Congress' intent."  
My single greatest problem with the proposed action here is one of statutory
interpretation.  The effect of its proposal would be to shrink markets and thereby
substantially limit the number of stations that one could own.  When Congress adopted
its radio ownership provision, Commission regulations defined these markets in a
particular way.  That way was the law of the land.  The Arbitron market definitions were
in existence, but they were not used for regulatory purposes, and Congress did not
specifically incorporate them.  I believe that it is disingenuous to suggest at this late date
that only by changing the market definition to Arbitron can we effectuate what Congress
"really meant."  I believe proper statutory interpretation would lead one to conclude that
Congress set its numerical limits against the market definition that prevailed in regulation
at the time, and not a definition that had not been used for this purpose previously.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SUP></SUP></SPAN><A HREF="#N_39_"><SUP> (39)</SUP></A>
<P> 
Moreover, if Congress did not mean to set the appropriate level of concentration, or the
acceptable level of diversity, what on earth are the numerical market levels meant to do?</SPAN></P>



<P>III.	CONCLUSION</SPAN></P>


<P>In conclusion, I do not believe that the Commission has justified its decision that
the 35 percent audience reach cap, the newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule or the
cable/broadcast cross-ownership rule continue to serve the public interest as a result of
competition as Section 202(h) requires.  With respect to each of these rules, I would have
supported further proceedings to more thoroughly evaluate the pervasive changes that
have occurred in the video marketplace, and whether these rules continue to achieve the
goals for which they were intended.  I think such an analysis is critical in light of the
challenges facing the broadcasting industry, especially the reality that the technical
advances in digital capabilities will allow more and more platforms to deliver video
programming.  This Commission must look forward if it is to foster, and not stand in the
way of, the digital revolution that is occurring across all of the communications
industries.  The approach taken by the Commission today, however, continues to look to
"the days of yesteryear," to justify its rules.  It is time to take the mask off this old Lone
Ranger and look more deeply into the face of change.</SPAN></P>




<P ALIGN="CENTER">ADDENDUM</P>



<P>The purpose of this Addendum is to address material that was added by the
majority to the item after its adoption and after the preceding statement was completed. 
Specifically, the facts in paragraph 28 and the analysis contained in the last four
sentences in paragraph 30 were circulated two weeks after the item was adopted.  As a
procedural matter, I am concerned that the changes, which I believe are substantive, have
been inappropriately added after the item's adoption on May 26, 2000 and may change
the adoption date of the item to no sooner than June 13, 2000, well past the statutory
deadline.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SUP></SUP></SPAN><A HREF="#N_40_"><SUP> (40)</SUP></A>   In any case, I will respond to the newly added material below.</SPAN></P>


<P>The majority now maintains that elimination <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">or</SPAN> relaxation of the national cap rule
would lead to "the consolidation of ownership of all or most of the television stations in
the country in the hands of a few national networks."</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SUP></SUP></SPAN><A HREF="#N_41_"><SUP> (41)</SUP></A>
<P>  This apocalyptic pronouncement
is without foundation.  As the <EM>Order </EM>itself points out, large numbers of stations are
currently owned by group owners and there is not even a hypothesis proffered as to why
such major commercial interests would suddenly sell their full complement of stations to
the networks.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SUP></SUP></SPAN><A HREF="#N_42_"><SUP> (42)</SUP></A>
<P>  </SPAN></P>


<P>While it may be a valid hypothesis that network-owned stations have an incentive
to clear the majority of their network programming, it is far from clear that they would
not also have economic incentives to program local content that would attract both
viewers and advertisers.  Clearly, competitive video service providers believe local
content is key to the success of their product.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SUP></SUP></SPAN><A HREF="#N_43_"><SUP> (43)</SUP></A>
<P>  Moreover, every station, regardless of
ownership, is required to serve its local community, a point relied on by the majority in
distinguishing broadcasters from other providers of programming,</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SUP></SUP></SPAN><A HREF="#N_44_"><SUP> (44)</SUP></A>  Thus, network-owned stations could not, arguably, run national programming exclusively.   </SPAN></P>


<P>The majority also now for the first time says that we should be concerned that
there is a loss of an outlet for non-network programming sources, but I am not sure that
this concern comports with the facts.  Do the current network owned and operated
stations have higher clearance rates for network programming?  Do they serve their local
communities with less local content than affiliated stations?  Do national programmers
find themselves blocked from distributing their product through stations owned and
operated by the networks?  Who knows?  We certainly have not bothered to look. </SPAN></P>


<P>The majority is correct in noting that Congress chose not to eliminate the cap, but
only to liberalize it in the 1996 Telecom Act.  But Congress also clearly instructed the
Commission to continually evaluate market and competitive conditions to determine
whether rules remain in the public interest.  Failing to have done so fully, it cannot glibly
escape its responsibility by deferring, without more, to a judgment Congress made four
years ago and one that Congress specifically directed us to continually revisit.</SPAN></P>
