  <h2><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#003399">New Attorney General 

    FOIA Memorandum Issued</font></h2>

</center>

<P>

<dd><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#003399"> A new statement 

  of Administration policy on the Freedom of Information Act has been issued by 

  Attorney General John Ashcroft and has been transmitted to all agencies across 

  the executive branch of the federal government. </font> 

  <P>

<dd><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#003399"> On October 12, 

  Attorney General Ashcroft issued a memorandum to the heads of all departments 

  and agencies that supersedes the Department of Justice FOIA policy memorandum 

  that had been in effect since October 1993. The new Ashcroft FOIA Memorandum 

  was effective immediately upon issuance, and the presidential statement on the 

  FOIA that was issued in 1993 remains in effect as well. </font> 

  <P>

<dd><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#003399"> The Ashcroft FOIA 

  Memorandum emphasizes the Administration's commitment to full compliance with 

  the FOIA as an important means of maintaining an open and accountable system 

  of government. At the same time, it recognizes the importance of protecting 

  the sensitive institutional, commercial, and personal interests that can be 

  implicated in government records -- such as the need to safeguard national security, 

  to maintain law enforcement effectiveness, to respect business confidentiality, 

  to protect internal agency deliberations, and to preserve personal privacy. 

  </font> 

  <P>

<dd><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#003399"> In replacing the 

  predecessor FOIA memorandum, the Ashcroft FOIA Memorandum establishes a new 

  "sound legal basis" standard governing the Department of Justice's decisions 

  on whether to defend agency actions under the FOIA when they are challenged 

  in court. This differs from the "foreseeable harm" standard that was employed 

  under the predecessor memorandum. Under the new standard, agencies should reach 

  the judgment that their use of a FOIA exemption is on sound footing, both factually 

  and legally, whenever they withhold requested information. </font> 

  <P>

<dd><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#003399"> Significantly, 

  the Ashcroft FOIA Memorandum also recognizes the continued agency practice of 

  considering whether to make discretionary disclosures of information that is 

  exempt under the Act, subject to statutory prohibitions and other applicable 

  limitations. It also places particular emphasis on the right to privacy among 

  the other interests that are protected by the FOIA's exemptions. </font> 

  <P>

<dd><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#003399">The text of the 

  Ashcroft FOIA Memorandum is as follows: </font> 

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#003399"><br>

    </font>

  <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#003399">Memorandum for 

    Heads of all Federal Departments and Agencies</font></p>

  <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#003399">From: John Ashcroft, 

    Attorney General</font></P>

  <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#003399">Subject: <U>The 

    Freedom of Information Act</U></font></P>

  <P>

<dd><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#003399"> As you know, the 

  Department of Justice and this Administration are committed to full compliance 

  with the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. <nobr>§ 552</nobr> (2000). 

  It is only through a well-informed citizenry that the leaders of our nation 

  remain accountable to the governed and the American people can be assured that 

  neither fraud nor government waste is concealed. </font> 

  <P>

<dd><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#003399"> The Department 

  of Justice and this Administration are equally committed to protecting other 

  fundamental values that are held by our society. Among them are safeguarding 

  our national security, enhancing the effectiveness of our law enforcement agencies, 

  protecting sensitive business information and, not least, preserving personal 

  privacy. </font> 

  <P>

<dd><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#003399"> Our citizens have 

  a strong interest as well in a government that is fully functional and efficient. 

  Congress and the courts have long recognized that certain legal privileges ensure 

  candid and complete agency deliberations without fear that they will be made 

  public. Other privileges ensure that lawyers' deliberations and communications 

  are kept private. No leader can operate effectively without confidential advice 

  and counsel. Exemption 5 of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. <nobr>§ 552(b)(5),</nobr> incorporates 

  these privileges and the sound policies underlying them. </font> 

  <P>

<dd><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#003399"> I encourage your 

  agency to carefully consider the protection of all such values and interests 

  when making disclosure determinations under the FOIA. Any discretionary decision 

  by your agency to disclose information protected under the FOIA should be made 

  only after full and deliberate consideration of the institutional, commercial, 

  and personal privacy interests that could be implicated by disclosure of the 

  information. </font> 

  <P>

<dd><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#003399"> In making these 

  decisions, you should consult with the Department of Justice's Office of Information 

  and Privacy when significant FOIA issues arise, as well as with our Civil Division 

  on FOIA litigation matters. When you carefully consider FOIA requests and decide 

  to withhold records, in whole or in part, you can be assured that the Department 

  of Justice will defend your decisions unless they lack a sound legal basis or 

  present an unwarranted risk of adverse impact on the ability of other agencies 

  to protect other important records. </font> 

  <P>

<dd><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#003399"> This memorandum 

  supersedes the Department of Justice's FOIA Memorandum of October 4, 1993, and 

  it likewise creates no substantive or procedural right enforceable at law. </font>

<dd><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#003399"> This policy memorandum 

  was issued pursuant to the Attorney General's specific statutory responsibility 

  "to encourage agency compliance with [the Freedom of Information Act]," 5 U.S.C. 

  <nobr>§ 552(e)(5)</nobr> (2000), a responsibility that the Department of Justice 

  discharges in several ways, including through statements of FOIA policy. <EM>See, 

  e.g.</EM>, <a href="/oip/00rep.htm"> Department of Justice Calendar Year 

  2000 Annual FOIA Report</a> at 99-107 ("Description of Department of Justice 

  Efforts to Encourage Agency Compliance with the Act"). </font> 

  <P>

<dd><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#003399"> A new FOIA policy 

  statement traditionally has been issued by the Attorney General at the beginning 

  of a new Administration. Such statements were issued in May 1977 by Attorney 

  General Griffin B. Bell, in May 1981 by Attorney General William French Smith, 

  and in October 1993 by Attorney General Janet Reno. The Ashcroft FOIA Memorandum 

  continues that tradition and in so doing calls attention to the administration 

  of the FOIA at the highest levels of all agencies. </font> 

  <P>

<dd><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#003399"> Additionally, the 

  Office of Information and Privacy is disseminating this new FOIA policy memorandum 

  to the principal administrative and legal FOIA contacts at all agencies, with 

  the request that it be further disseminated as widely and expeditiously as possible 

  through FOIA administrative channels within each agency. This dissemination 

  should ensure that the memorandum reaches all FOIA personnel within each agency 

  directly, in addition to through its distribution by each agency head. </font> 

  <P>

<dd><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#003399"> OIP also will be 

  both distributing and discussing the Ashcroft FOIA Memorandum at a FOIA Officers 

  Conference to be held on October 18. A second topic to be discussed at this 

  FOIA Officers Conference will be agency implementation of the electronic availability 

  and annual reporting requirements of the Electronic Freedom of Information Act 

  Amendments of 1996, in accordance with this past year's General Accounting Office 

  Report entitled, "Progress in Implementing the 1996 Electronic Freedom of Information 

  Act Amendments"). OIP issued a policy guidance memorandum on that subject earlier 

  this year, <EM>see</EM> <EM>FOIA Post</EM>, <A HREF="/oip/foiapost/2001foiapost3.htm">"GAO 

  E-FOIA Implementation Report Issued"</a> (posted 3/23/01), and issued follow-up 

  guidance on the preparation of annual FOIA reports as well, <EM>see</em> <em>FOIA 

  Post</EM>, <A HREF="/oip/foiapost/2001foiapost13.htm">"Supplemental Guidance 

  on Annual FOIA Reports"</a> (posted 8/13/01). </font> 

  <P>

<dd><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#003399"> Lastly, a third 

  topic that will be discussed at this FOIA Officers Conference is one that has 

  become a subject of greatly increased significance since the horrific events 

  of September 11. In light of those events, and the possibilities for further 

  terrorist activity in their aftermath, federal agencies are concerned with the 

  need to protect critical systems, facilities, stockpiles, and other assets from 

  security breaches and harm -- and in some instances from their potential use 

  as weapons of mass destruction in and of themselves. Such protection efforts, 

  of course, must at the same time include the protection of any agency information 

  that could enable someone to succeed in causing the feared harm. </font> 

  <P>

<dd><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#003399"> Protection for 

  such records or information, if requested under the FOIA, is available under 

  Exemption 2 of the Act, 5 U.S.C. <nobr>§ 552(b)(2)</nobr> (2000). Any agency 

  assessment of, or statement regarding, the vulnerability of such a critical 

  asset should be protected pursuant to Exemption 2. <EM>See</EM> <a href="/oip/foia_updates/Vol_X_3/page3.html"><EM>FOIA 

  Update</EM>, Vol. X, No. 3</a>, at 3-4 ("OIP Guidance: Protecting Vulnerability 

  Assessments Through Application of Exemption Two"). Beyond that, a wide range 

  of information can be withheld under Exemption 2's "circumvention" aspect, sometimes 

  referred to as "high 2," as is discussed in the <a href="/oip/exemption2.htm#high2">"'High 

  2': Risk of Circumvention"</a> Subsection of the "Exemption 2" Section of the 

  "Justice Department Guide to the Freedom of Information Act." Agencies should 

  be sure to avail themselves of the full measure of Exemption 2's protection 

  for their critical infrastructure information as they continue to gather more 

  of it, and assess its heightened sensitivity, in the wake of the September 11 

  terrorist attacks. </font> 

  <P>

<dd><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#003399"> Any question concerning 

  the Ashcroft FOIA Memorandum, about implementation of the Electronic FOIA Amendments, 

  about the use of Exemption 2 to provide necessary protection in the wake of 

  terrorism, or about any aspect of FOIA administration can be raised through 

  the Office of Information and Privacy's FOIA Counselor service, at (202) 514-3642.
