            Ozone Facts: What is the Ozone Hole?
          </h1>
          <p>
            The ozone hole is not technically a &#8220;hole&#8221; where
            no ozone is present, but is actually a region of
            exceptionally depleted ozone in the stratosphere over the
            Antarctic that happens at the beginning of Southern
            Hemisphere spring (August&#8211;October). Satellite
            instruments provide us with daily images of ozone over the
            Antarctic region. The ozone hole image below shows the very
            low values (blue and purple colored area) centered over
            Antarctica on October 4, 2004. From the historical record
            we know that total column ozone values of less than 220
            Dobson Units were not observed prior to 1979. From an
            aircraft field mission over Antarctica we also know that
            a total column ozone level of less than 220 Dobson Units is a
            result of catalyzed ozone loss from chlorine and bromine
            compounds. For these reasons, we use 220 Dobson Units as the 
            boundary of the region representing ozone loss. Using the
            daily snapshots of total column ozone, we can calculate the
            area on the Earth that is enclosed by a line with values of 220
            Dobson Units (the white line in the figure below).

          <h2>
            Chlorofluorocarbons and ozone
          </h2>
          <p>
            Many people have heard that the ozone hole is caused by
            chemicals called CFCs, short for chlorofluorocarbons. CFCs
            escape into the atmosphere from refrigeration and propellant
            devices and processes. In the lower atmosphere, they are
            so stable that they persist for years, even decades. This
            long lifetime allows some of the CFCs to eventually reach
            the stratosphere. In the stratosphere, ultraviolet light
            breaks the bond holding chlorine atoms (Cl) to the CFC
            molecule. A free chlorine atom goes on to participate in a
            series of chemical reactions that both destroy ozone and
            return the free chlorine atom to the atmosphere unchanged,
            where it can destroy more and more ozone molecules. For
            those who know the story of CFCs and ozone, that is the part
            of the tale that is probably familiar.
          </p>
          <p>
            The part of the story that fewer people know is that while
            the chlorine atoms freed from CFCs do ultimately destroy
            ozone, the destruction doesn&#8217;t happen immediately.
            Most of the roaming chlorine that gets separated from CFCs
            actually becomes part of two chemicals that&#8212;under
            <em>normal</em> atmospheric conditions&#8212;are so stable
            that scientists consider them to be long-term reservoirs for
            chlorine. So how does the chlorine get out of the reservoir
            each spring?
          </p>

          <h2>
            Polar stratospheric clouds and ozone
          </h2>
          <p>
            Under normal atmospheric conditions, the two chemicals that
            store most atmospheric chlorine (hydrochloric acid, and
            chlorine nitrate) are stable. But in the long months of
            polar darkness over Antarctica in the winter, atmospheric
            conditions are unusual. An endlessly circling whirlpool of
            stratospheric winds called the polar vortex isolates the air
            in the center. Because it is completely dark, the air in the
            vortex gets so cold that clouds form, even though the
            Antarctic air is extremely thin and dry. Chemical reactions
            take place that could not take place anywhere else in the
            atmosphere. These unusual reactions can occur only on the
            surface of polar stratospheric cloud particles, which may be
            water, ice, or nitric acid, depending on the temperature.
          </p>
          <div class="content_image">
            <p>
              The frozen crytals that make up polar stratospheric clouds
              provide a surface for the reactions that free chlorine
              atoms in the Antarctic stratosphere.

          </div>
          <p>
            These reactions convert the inactive chlorine reservoir
            chemicals into more active forms, especially chlorine gas
            (Cl<sub>2</sub>). When the sunlight returns to the South
            Pole in October, UV light rapidly breaks the bond between
            the two chlorine atoms, releasing free chlorine into the
            stratosphere, where it takes part in reactions that destroy
            ozone molecules while regenerating the chlorine (known as a
            catalytic reaction). A catalytic reaction allows a single
            chlorine atom to destroy thousands of ozone molecules.
            Bromine is involved in a second catalytic reaction with
            chlorine that contributes a large fraction of ozone loss.
            The ozone hole grows throughout the early spring until
            temperatures warm and the polar vortex weakens, ending the
            isolation of the air in the polar vortex. As air from the
            surrounding latitudes mixes into the polar region, the
            ozone-destroying forms of chlorine disperse. The ozone layer
            stabilizes until the following spring.
