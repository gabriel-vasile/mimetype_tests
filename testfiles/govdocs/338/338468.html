	  		<p> <strong>Whitman Details Ongoing Agency Efforts to Monitor Disaster Sites, 
				Contribute to Cleanup Efforts</strong> [<a href="../stories/headline_091801es.htm">En 
				Espa&ntilde;ol</a>]			</p>
	  		<p>	  </p>
	  		<p> EPA Administrator Christie Whitman announced today that results from 
		the Agency's air and drinking water monitoring near the World Trade Center 
		and Pentagon disaster sites indicate that these vital resources are safe. 
		Whitman also announced that EPA has been given up to $83 million from 
		the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to support EPA's involvement 
		in cleanup activities and ongoing monitoring of environmental conditions 
		in both the New York City and Washington metropolitan areas following 
		last week's terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.	  </p>
	  		<p> &quot;We are very encouraged that the results from our monitoring of air 
		quality and drinking water conditions in both New York and near the Pentagon 
		show that the public in these areas is not being exposed to excessive 
		levels of asbestos or other harmful substances,&quot; Whitman said. &quot;Given 
		the scope of the tragedy from last week, I am glad to reassure the people 
		of New York and Washington, D.C. that their air is safe to breath and 
		their water is safe to drink,&quot; she added.	  </p>
	  		<p> In the aftermath of last Tuesday's attacks, EPA has worked closely with 
		state, federal and local authorities to provide expertise on cleanup methods 
		for hazardous materials, as well as to detect whether any contaminants 
		are found in ambient air quality monitoring, sampling of drinking water 
		sources and sampling of runoff near the disaster sites.	  </p>
	  		<p> At the request of FEMA, EPA has been involved in the cleanup and site 
		monitoring efforts, working closely with the U.S. Coast Guard, the Centers 
		for Disease Control (CDC), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration 
		(OSHA) and state and local organizations.	  </p>
	  		<p> EPA has conducted repeated monitoring of ambient air at the site of 
		the World Trade Center and in the general Wall Street district of Manhattan, 
		as well as in Brooklyn. The Agency is planning to perform air monitoring 
		in the surrounding New York metropolitan area. EPA has established 10 
		continuous (stationary) air monitoring stations near the WTC site. Thus 
		far, from 50 air samples taken, the vast majority of results are either 
		non-detectable or below established levels of concern for asbestos, lead 
		and volatile organic compounds. The highest levels of asbestos have been 
		detected within one-half block of ground zero, where rescuers have been 
		provided with appropriate protective equipment.	  </p>
	  		<p> In lower Manhattan, the City of New York has also been involved in efforts 
		to clean anything coated with debris dust resulting from Tuesday's destruction. 
		This involves spraying water over buildings, streets and sidewalks to 
		wash the accumulated dust off the building and eliminate the possibility 
		that materials would become airborne. To complement this clean up effort, 
		EPA has performed 62 dust sample analyses for the presence of asbestos 
		and other substances. Most dust samples fall below EPA's definition of 
		&quot;asbestos containing material&quot; (one percent asbestos). Where samples have 
		shown greater than one percent asbestos, EPA has operated its 10 High 
		Efficiency Particulate Arresting, HEPA, vacuum trucks to clean the area 
		and then resample. EPA also used the 10 HEPA vac trucks to clean streets 
		and sidewalks in the Financial District in preparation for Monday's return 
		to business. The Agency plans to use HEPA vac trucks to clean the lobbies 
		of the five federal buildings near the World Trade Center site, and to 
		clean the streets outside of New York's City Hall.	  </p>
	  		<p> Drinking water in Manhattan was tested at 13 sampling points, in addition 
		to one test at the Newtown Sewage Treatment plant and pump station. Initial 
		results of this drinking water sampling show that levels of asbestos are 
		well below EPA's levels of concern.	  </p>
	  		<p> While FEMA has provided EPA with a Total Project Ceiling cost of slightly 
		more than $83 million for the Agency's cleanup efforts in New York City 
		and in at the Pentagon site, EPA currently is working with emergency funding 
		of $23.7 million. If costs exceed this level, FEMA will authorize EPA 
		to tap additional funding in increments of $15 million. As part of the 
		additional funding to be provided by FEMA, EPA will be responsible for 
		any hazardous waste disposal, general site safety and providing sanitation 
		facilities for many of the search and rescue workers to wash the dust 
		off following their shifts. EPA is coordinating with both the U.S. Air 
		Force Center for Environmental Excellence and the U.S. Coast Guard to 
		quickly implement these additional responsibilities to ensure that search 
		and rescue personnel are provided with the maximum support and protection 
		from hazardous materials that may be found during their mission.	  </p>
	  		<p> At the Pentagon explosion site in Arlington Va., EPA has also been involved 
		in a variety of monitoring of air and water quality. All ambient air monitoring 
		results, both close to the crash site and in the general vicinity, have 
		shown either no detection of asbestos or levels that fall well below the 
		Agency's level of concern. Testing of runoff water from the disaster site 
		does not show elevated levels of contaminants. Given the large numbers 
		of Department of Defense (DOD) employees returning to work this week, 
		EPA has worked closely with officials from DOD and from the Occupational 
		Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to evaluate air and drinking water 
		quality and to be certain that the workplace environment will be safe.	  </p>
	  		<p> While careful not to impede the search, rescue and cleanup efforts at 
		either the World Trade Center or the Pentagon disaster sites, EPA's primary 
		concern has been to ensure that rescue workers and the public are not 
		being exposed to elevated levels of potentially hazardous contaminants 
		in the dust and debris, especially where practical solutions are available 
		to reduce exposure. EPA has assisted efforts to provide dust masks to 
		rescue workers to minimize inhalation of dust. EPA also recommends that 
		the blast site debris continue to be kept wet, which helps to significantly 
		reduce the amount of airborne dust which can aggravate respiratory ailments 
		such as asthma. On-site facilities are being made available for rescue 
		workers to clean themselves, change their clothing and to have dust-laden 
		clothes cleaned separately from normal household wash.	  </p>
