          those designated in their service agreement) on an as-available

          basis at no additional charge.  Because the firm point-to-point

          customers taking secondary non-firm are accorded this scheduling

          flexibility at no additional charge, they are properly accorded a

          lower priority than stand alone, non-firm transmission.  In

          contrast, network customers are responsible for paying for a

          percentage of total system transmission costs in order to serve

          their designated network loads whether the energy is from

          designated network resources or from non-designated resources on

          an as-available basis. 310/  Because the network customer pays a

          load-ratio share of total transmission costs, it receives a

          higher priority.  Significantly, if any firm point-to-point

          customer wants to avail itself of the higher priority associated

          with economy energy purchases under the network tariff, it is

          free to do so by undertaking the cost responsibilities associated

          with network service.

               Finally, in response to VT DPS, we note that we have chosen

          different approaches in the electric and natural gas areas.  In

          this regard, we recognize that there is a trade-off between

          encouraging tradable capacity rights versus maximizing revenues

          that can be credited against the transmission provider's costs of

          providing transmission service.  On the electric side, fully

          developed transmission capacity trading rights simply do not

          exist at this time, and so we have chosen to emphasize an


               This is comparable to the service a utility provides its
               native load.ÿÿ

          approach that maximizes revenues to be credited to transmission

          customers.  However, we will continue to evaluate our approach in

          the context of any future transmission rate proposal that is

          based on the concept of tradable capacity rights.

                    4.  Reciprocity Provision

               In the Final Rule, the Commission concluded that it was

          appropriate to require a reciprocity provision in the pro forma

          tariff. 311/  The Commission explained that this provision will

          be applicable to all customers, including non-public utility

          entities such as municipally-owned entities and RUS cooperatives,

          that own, control or operate interstate transmission facilities

          and that take service under the open access tariff, and any

          affiliates of the customer that own, control or operate

          interstate transmission facilities.

               The Commission developed a voluntary safe harbor procedure

          under which non-public utilities would be allowed to submit to

          the Commission a transmission tariff and a request for

          declaratory order that the tariff meets the Commission's

          comparability (non-discrimination) standards.  The Commission

          explained that if it finds that a tariff contains terms and

          conditions that substantially conform or are superior to those in

          the Final Rule pro forma tariff, it will deem it an acceptable

          reciprocity tariff and require public utilities to provide open

          access service to that non-public utility.

          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001         -3-
            and RM94-7-002

               If a non-public utility chooses not to seek a Commission

          determination that its tariff meets the Commission's

          comparability standards, the Commission declared that a public

          utility could refuse to provide open access transmission service. 

          However, any such denial must be based on a good faith assertion

          that the non-public utility has not met the Commission's

          reciprocity requirements.

               In support of its decision to adopt a reciprocity provision,

          the Commission explained that it was not requiring non-public

          utilities to provide transmission access, but was conditioning

          the use of public utilities' open access services on an agreement

          to offer open access services in return.  The Commission noted

          that non-public utilities can choose not to take service under

          public utility open access tariffs and can instead seek voluntary

          service from the public utility on a bilateral basis.

               The Commission further explained that the reciprocity

          requirement strikes an appropriate balance by limiting its

          application to circumstances in which the non-public utility

          seeks to take advantage of open access on a public utility's

          system.  However, the Commission recognized that Congress has

          determined that certain entities in the bulk power market can use

          tax-exempt financing by issuing bonds that do not constitute

          "private activity bonds" 312/ or by financing facilities with



               See 26 U.S.C.  141.  Interest on private activity bonds is
               taxable unless the bonds are qualified bonds for which a
               specific exception is included in the Internal Revenue Code.





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001         -4-
            and RM94-7-002

          "local furnishing" bonds. 313/  The Commission stated that it was

          not its purpose to disturb Congress' and the IRS's determinations

          with respect to tax-exempt financing.  Therefore, the Commission

          clarified that reciprocal service will not be required if

          providing such service would jeopardize the tax-exempt status of

          the transmission customer's (or its corporate affiliates') bonds

          used to finance such transmission facilities. 314/  

               With respect to local furnishing bonds, which are available

          to a handful of public utilities, the Commission noted that

          Congress, in section 1919 of the Energy Policy Act, amended

          section 142(f) of the Internal Revenue Code to provide that a

          facility shall not be treated as failing to meet the local

          furnishing requirement by reason of transmission services ordered

          by the Commission under section 211 of the FPA if "the portion of

          the cost of the facility financed with tax-exempt bonds is not

          greater than the portion of the cost of the facility which is

          allocable to the local furnishing of electric energy." 315/  So

          that any local furnishing bonds that may exist do not interfere

          with the effective operation of an open access transmission

          regime, the Commission required any public utility that is

          subject to the Open Access Rule that has financed transmission



               See 26 U.S.C.  142.

               The Commission also clarified that reciprocal service will
               not be required if providing such service would jeopardize a
               G&T cooperative's tax-exempt status. 

               26 U.S.C.  142(f)(2)(A).





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001         -5-
            and RM94-7-002

          facilities with local furnishing bonds to include in its tariff a

          similar provision that it will not contest the issuance of an

          order under section 211 of the FPA requiring the provision of

          such service, and will, within 10 days of receiving a written

          request by the applicant, file with the Commission a written

          waiver of its rights to a request for reciprocal service from the

          applicant under section 213(a) of the FPA and to the issuance of

          a proposed order under section 212(c). 

               In addition, the Commission limited the reciprocity

          requirement to the applicant and corporate affiliates.  The

          Commission explained that if a G&T cooperative seeks open access

          transmission service from the transmission provider, then only

          the G&T cooperative, and not its member distribution

          cooperatives, would be required to offer transmission service. 

          However, if a member distribution cooperative itself receives

          transmission service from the transmission provider, then it (but

          not its G&T cooperative) must offer reciprocal transmission

          service over any interstate transmission facilities that it may

          own, control or operate.

               Furthermore, the Commission explained that a non-public

          utility, for good cause shown, may file a request for waiver of

          all or part of the reciprocity requirement.

               The Commission also explained that the reciprocity

          requirement will apply to any entity that owns, controls or

          operates interstate transmission facilities that uses a marketer

          or other intermediary to obtain access.  The Commission added





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001         -6-
            and RM94-7-002

          that it would apply the same criteria to waive the reciprocity

          condition for small non-public utilities as for small public

          utilities.

               Rehearing Requests

                    Reciprocity Provision -- Public Power Position 

               A number of public power entities argue that the reciprocity

          provision should be eliminated because the Commission cannot

          require indirectly what it cannot require directly. 316/  Several

          other public power entities add that the reciprocity obligation

          is beyond the jurisdiction of the Commission because the

          transmission obligations of non-public utilities (e.g., municipal

          utilities) are established and limited to those required by

          sections 211 and 212 of the FPA. 317/  Tallahassee asserts that

          the Commission's conditioning approach has the effect of

          excluding an entire class of transmission customer from open

          access, i.e., those unable to grant reciprocal service.  This,

          Tallahassee asserts, is discriminatory and contrary to the

          purpose of the Final Rule and the requirements of sections 205,

          206 and 212 of the FPA.  TANC argues that the Commission does not

          have the discretion to grant or withhold open access transmission

          on the condition that the customer consent to doing something

          that the Commission admits it cannot directly order:  "The

          Commission has never 'conditioned' its duty to allow only just



               E.g., NRECA, Oglethorpe, AEC & SMEPA, TANC.

               E.g., Redding, Tallahassee, TANC, Dairyland.





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001         -7-
            and RM94-7-002

          and reasonable rates on any action by the customer." (TANC at

          16).

               A number of entities challenge the Commission's assertion

          that the reciprocity requirement for non-public utilities is

          voluntary. 318/  Dairyland contends that the alternative of

          seeking a bilateral agreement is illusory -- even if it could be

          obtained -- because Order No. 888 provides that any bilateral

          wholesale coordination agreement executed after July 9, 1996 will

          be subject to open access requirements.  Dairyland argues that

          the phrase "subject to open access requirements" presumably would

          include the reciprocity requirement for non-public utilities.

               AEC & SMEPA assert that there is no record support for the

          contention that non-public utilities are responsible for closed

          systems or that such systems, if any, have an impact on the

          market.

               NRECA asserts that if the reciprocity provision is retained,

          the Commission should "modify its terms to incorporate the

          statutory standards and protections which FPA sections 211 and

          212 contain." 319/ 

               Umatilla Coop asks the Commission to clarify that

          distribution cooperatives will not become subject to the


               E.g., NRECA, Dairyland, TDU Systems, AEC & SMEPA.

               NRECA at 29.  NRECA specifically lists the following: 
               reliability of electric service; impairment of contracts;
               ability to cease service; all costs associated with the
               service must be recovered; retail marketing areas; and
               prohibitions on retail wheeling and sham wholesale
               transactions.  See also Oglethorpe.





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001         -8-
            and RM94-7-002

          reciprocity requirements merely because they purchase power from

          affiliated cooperatives that are acting as power marketers.  TDU

          Systems assert that a cooperative should not have to render

          reciprocal service if it would interfere with its ability to

          obtain RUS loan financing.

               TAPS declares that the transmission provider alone should

          not have access to third-party systems through reciprocity.  It

          maintains that the utility's long-term transmission customers

          should also be afforded access to those third-party systems so

          that the transmission provider does not have a competitive

          advantage.  TAPS argues that a third-party should be required to

          have an open access tariff available.

                    Reciprocity Provision -- Utility Position

               A number of utilities argue that the exemption from

          reciprocity for distribution cooperatives should be eliminated.

          320/  EEI and Montana-Dakota Utilities assert that G&Ts could

          eliminate their reciprocity obligation by selling or transferring

          their transmission facilities to their distribution

          owner/members.  Southwestern argues that the exception for

          distribution cooperatives puts public utilities at a competitive

          disadvantage in that distribution cooperatives can use a public

          utility's system to compete with the public utility, but a public

          utility cannot use the distribution cooperatives' systems to




               E.g., EEI, Entergy, Montana-Dakota Utilities, Southwestern,
               Oklahoma E&G, Southern.





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001         -9-
            and RM94-7-002

          compete to sell power to their customers. 321/  It adds that the

          exception allows distribution cooperatives to hide behind shell

          G&Ts. For example, Southwestern argues that Golden Spread

          Electric Cooperative is a shell G&T because it owns only small

          amounts of facilities.  It concludes that reciprocal access may

          become especially important if a state implements a retail access

          plan because section 211 cannot be used to obtain transmission

          for retail access over a distribution cooperative's system.

               Southern claims that cooperatives have argued in courts and

          in Congress that a G&T cooperative and its distribution

          cooperative owners are unified economic interests in which the

          interest of the whole is equal to the sum of the parts, and that

          federal courts have upheld this view (citing one case -- City of

          Morgan City v. South Louisiana Electric Cooperative Ass'n, 49

          F.3d 1074 (5th Cir. 1995) (Morgan City)).

               EEI claims that clarification of certain aspects of

          reciprocity is needed:  (1) public utilities may not be able to

          determine if reciprocal service is comparable because non-public

          utilities do not have to provide Form 1 data, and thus non-public

          utilities should be required to submit additional data; (2) non-

          public utilities should be required to functionally unbundle,

          charge rates to themselves and others that reflect the cost of

          using the system themselves, comply with the standards of

          conduct, and establish an OASIS; (3) non-public utility members



               See also Oklahoma E&G.





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001         -10-
            and RM94-7-002

          of an RTG should be required to offer reciprocal service

          comparable to that provided by public utility members; and (4) a

          non-public utility should be required to provide all services it

          is reasonably capable of providing.  Carolina P&L adds that a

          customer should be required to provide the full panoply of

          transmission services that it is capable of providing because the

          customer has a right to take any type of service from the

          transmission provider even though it may only choose one

          particular service.

               Tucson Power asks the Commission to clarify how it will

          determine the comparability of a non-public utility's tariff.  It

          asserts that first, under the safe harbor option, the Commission

          should clarify (1) that non-public utilities must comply with the

          Commission's rules of practice and procedure, and (2) how it will

          determine that the rates, terms and conditions of the reciprocal

          service are comparable to the service the non-public utility

          provides itself (Tucson Power argues that this could require

          submittal of data comparable to that contained in Form 1). 

          Second, the Commission should eliminate the option that would

          require the public utility to determine whether the request by

          the non-public utility is consistent with the tariff.  Finally,

          under the RTG option, the Commission should clarify that the

          evidentiary requirements for non-public utilities that are

          members of an RTG will be the same as for non-public utilities

          using the safe harbor procedure, i.e., any disputes regarding

          compliance should be resolved by the Commission, not the RTG.





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001         -11-
            and RM94-7-002

               A number of utilities assert that the Commission should not

          limit the right to obtain reciprocity only to the public utility

          that provides the transmission service because power could

          actually flow over other public utilities' transmission lines. 

          They argue that the Commission should ensure that open access

          transmission is as widely available as possible. 322/  EEI

          asserts that Federal power marketing agencies, including BPA,

          should be required to provide comparable open access

          transmission.

               Oklahoma G&E argues that Order No. 888 violates the

          Constitution's equal protection principles because it does not

          require universal open access.  It asserts that the Commission

          has created an arbitrary distinction between classes of utilities

          that is unrelated to the Commission's objective and therefore is

          constitutionally invalid.  Oklahoma G&E contends that the proper

          approach is to proceed under EPAct for all transmitting utilities

          on a case-by-case basis.

               Detroit Edison asks the Commission to clarify that the

          supplier and the recipient of power are direct beneficiaries and

          must be considered transmission customers for reciprocity

          purposes.  Otherwise, Detroit Edison contends, parties from

          jurisdictional transmission transactions may be able to evade

          reciprocity.

          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001         -12-
            and RM94-7-002

               CCEM argues that reciprocity should be expanded to require a

          transmission customer obtaining open access service also to

          provide open-access transmission service to all eligible

          customers.  Otherwise, CCEM maintains, transmission owners will

          be able to penetrate into wholesale markets controlled by non-

          public utilities, but power marketers will not.

               CCEM asks the Commission to clarify that when a non-public

          utility obtains open access from a power pool, member of a power

          pool, or parties to some form of bilateral coordination

          agreement, its reciprocity obligation extends to all eligible

          customers, including all members of the pool or parties to the

          agreement.

               Commission Conclusion

               We continue to believe that it is appropriate to condition

          the use of public utility open access tariffs on the agreement of

          the tariff user to provide reciprocal access to the transmission

          provider.  No eligible customer, including a non-public utility,

          that takes advantage of non-discriminatory open access

          transmission tariff services should be allowed to deny service or

          otherwise discriminate against the open access provider.  As we

          explained in the Final Rule,

                    [n]on-public utilities, whether they are
                    selling power from their own generation
                    facilities or reselling purchased power, have
                    the ability to foreclose their customers'
                    access to alternative power sources, and to
                    take advantage of new markets in the
                    traditional service territories of other
                    utilities.  While we do not take issue with
                    the rights these non-public utilities may





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001         -13-
            and RM94-7-002

                    have under other laws, we will not permit
                    them open access to jurisdictional
                    transmission without offering comparable
                    service in return.  We believe the
                    reciprocity requirement strikes an
                    appropriate balance by limiting its
                    application to circumstances in which the
                    non-public utility seeks to take advantage of
                    open access on a public utility's system.
                    [323/]  

               Contrary to arguments raised on rehearing, we are not

          requiring non-public utilities to provide transmission access. 

          Instead, we are conditioning the use of public utility open

          access tariffs, by all customers including non-public utilities,

          on an agreement to offer comparable (not unduly discriminatory)

          services in return. 324/  It would not be in the public interest

          to allow a non-public utility to take non-discriminatory

          transmission service from a public utility at the same time it

          refuses to provide comparable service to the public utility.  

          This would restrict the operation of robust competitive markets

          and would harm the very ratepayers that Congress has charged us

          to protect.  Very simply, we refuse to take a head-in-the-sand

          approach and order a remedy for undue discrimination that will

               As discussed infra, non-public utilities may seek a waiver
               of the reciprocity condition.  We therefore reject
               Tallahassee's argument that we are excluding an entire class
               of transmission customer from open access, i.e., those
               unable to grant reciprocal service.  If the Commission
               determines that a particular customer truly is not able to
               reciprocate, the reciprocity condition can be waived.  These
               situations are obviously different from situations involving
               entities that do not wish to provide reciprocal service.





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001         -14-
            and RM94-7-002

          permit the beneficiaries of the remedy to engage in unduly

          discriminatory actions.

               Moreover, non-public utilities are free to seek from a

          public utility a waiver of the open access tariff reciprocity

          condition.  We note that this is a modification of our statements

          in Order No. 888, in which we said that non-public utilities

          could seek a voluntary offer of transmission service from a

          public utility on a bilateral basis.  Since the time Order No.

          888 issued, we have concluded that except in unusual

          circumstances, public utility services should be provided

          pursuant to the open access tariff and not pursuant to separate

          bilateral agreements. 325/  This applies to all customers,

          including non-public utilities.  Therefore, rather than

          requesting a bilateral agreement in order to avoid the

          reciprocity condition, non-public utilities instead may ask a

          utility for a waiver of the reciprocity condition in the

          utility's open access tariff.  We disagree with Dairyland that

          this type of alternative approach is illusory.  If the public

          utility chooses voluntarily to grant a waiver, the reciprocity

          condition would not apply.

               We reject NRECA's request that we incorporate in the

          reciprocity condition the statutory standards and protections of

          FPA sections 211 and 212.  NRECA states on rehearing that

          mandated services to third parties would endanger cooperatives'

            and RM94-7-002

          ability to provide service to members, or increase members'

          costs.  It further states that sections 211 and 212 provide

          substantive protections to ensure continued service to the

          transmitting utility's own customers, and to avoid their

          subsidization of services to third parties.  NRECA appears to

          believe that these substantive protections are not provided

          outside the context of sections 211 and 212.  We disagree.  We

          believe the protections that NRECA is seeking are contained in

          the pro forma tariff and, as required by section 6 of the tariff,

          the non-public utility must offer its service on similar terms

          and conditions. 326/

               We also reject requests that we not grant the exception to

          reciprocity provided in the Final Rule for distribution

          cooperatives and joint action agencies.  We continue to believe

          that if a G&T cooperative seeks open access transmission service

          from the transmission provider, then only the G&T cooperative,

          and not its member distribution cooperatives, should be required

          to offer transmission service. 327/  Without a corporate

          affiliation between G&T cooperatives and their member



               With regard to the basic substantive protections such as
               reliability, opportunity to recover costs, and the standards
               for rates, terms and conditions of transmission service, we
               see no relative distinctions between sections 211 and 212
               and sections 205 and 206 of the FPA.

               In response to Southern's citation to Morgan City, while
               this case provides some background as to the relationship
               between G&T cooperatives and distribution cooperatives, it
          in no way suggests that the relationship rises to the level of a
          corporate affiliation.

          distribution cooperatives, we do not believe it is appropriate to

          apply the reciprocity condition to the member distribution

          cooperatives.  To do so would result in the member distribution

          cooperatives being bound by their G&T cooperatives. 328/   

               Carolina P&L has brought to our attention a possible

          misunderstanding as to the meaning of comparable transmission

          service that a non-public utility must agree to provide as a

          condition of using an open access tariff.  Because a non-public

          utility may choose any type of service from a public utility

          transmission provider that the transmission provider provides or

          is capable of providing, we clarify that a non-public utility

          seeking to take service under the transmission provider's open

          access tariff must likewise agree to offer to provide the

          transmission provider any service that the non-public utility

          provides or is capable of providing on its system in order to

          satisfy reciprocity.  We note that in the Final Rule we explained

          that "[a]ny public utility that offers non-discriminatory open

          access transmission for the benefit of customers should be able

          to obtain the same non-discriminatory access in return." 329/  In


               However, in response to Umatilla Coop, we clarify that to
               the extent a distribution cooperative purchases power from
               an affiliated cooperative that is acting as a power
               marketer, the distribution cooperative will be subject to
               the reciprocity condition because of the marketing affiliate
               relationship between the two.  Moreover, as we explained in
               the Final Rule, the reciprocity condition also applies to
               any entity that owns, controls or operates transmission
               facilities and that uses a marketer or other intermediary to
               obtain access.  FERC Stats. & Regs. at 31,763; mimeo at 378.

          this regard, because a public utility must have an OASIS and a

          standard of conduct for employee separation, so must a non-public

          utility that seeks open access transmission from a public

          utility. 330/

               At the same time, however, we deny requests to expand the

          reciprocity condition. 331/  Although we believe that non-public

          utilities should provide open access transmission as a matter of

          policy, to require non-public utilities to offer transmission

          service to entities other than the public utility transmission

          providers increases the chances that they could lose tax-exempt

          status.  Accordingly, we have adopted a policy that recognizes

          the statutory tax restrictions placed on non-public utilities but

          also balances the fundamental unfairness of requiring a utility

          to make its facilities available to someone who could use that

          access to the competitive disadvantage of the utility. 

          Ultimately the public interest is best served by nationwide open

          access and, if the tax issue is favorably resolved, we may

          revisit the matter.

               77 FERC  61,076 (1996).  Of course, the non-public utility
               can always seek a waiver of the OASIS and standard of
               conduct requirements.  Such a waiver request will be
               evaluated under the same criteria applicable to a waiver
               requests by a public utility.

               In reaching this conclusion, we note that the electric
               industry currently conducts business using contract path
               pricing.  If we are presented with a regional proposal for
               flow-based pricing, we will reconsider whether there is a
               need to expand reciprocity as requested by certain entities.

               Moreover, in response to Detroit Edison, we take this

          opportunity to clarify that reciprocity would apply to a

          wholesale purchaser if a generation seller obtains transmission

          service from a public utility to sell to such purchaser and such

          purchaser owns, operates or controls interstate transmission

          facilities.  The same would be true where the seller owns,

          operates and controls interstate transmission facilities and the

          buyer arranges for the transmission service.  Just as with

          marketers or other intermediaries, we do not intend to allow

          reciprocity to be defeated simply on the basis of whether the

          seller or buyer requests transmission.  Such a result would

          elevate form over substance.  

               With respect to TDU System's assertion that reciprocal

          service should not have to be rendered if it would interfere with

          RUS loan financing, we note that we have already indicated that

          reciprocal service need not be provided if tax-exempt status

          would be jeopardized.  If TDU Systems is arguing that we should

          not require reciprocal service if RUS attaches such a condition

          in its regulation of RUS-financed cooperatives, we reject such an

          argument.  Such cooperatives have the option to seek bilateral

          service agreements.

               We reject EEI's and Tucson Power's argument that non-public

          utilities must provide Form 1 data in order to provide comparable

          service.  The Form 1 data would be relevant only if the

          Commission were setting non-public utilities' rates.  Such a

          detailed review is not necessary, however.  See Santee Cooper, 75

          satisfy reciprocity.

               Rehearing Requests

                    Safe Harbor/Waiver Provisions   

               NRECA states that the following issues related to safe

          harbor status and declaratory order requests need clarification: 

          (1) under what statutory authority is the Commission considering

          such petitions?  (2) what rights do non-public utilities have to

          obtain review of Commission determinations with which they

          disagree?  (3) how closely will a reciprocal tariff have to

          conform to Order No. 888 to win approval?  (4) will non-public

          utilities have to pay the standard fee (now $11,550) with a

          declaratory order petition? 332/ and (5) will the Commission

          allow non-public utilities to include a stranded cost recovery

          provision similar to section 26 of the pro forma tariff? 333/  

          Oglethorpe asserts that the Commission should not use these

          procedures to assert jurisdiction over non-public transmitting

          utilities.  Dairyland contends that requiring non-public

          utilities to invoke declaratory order or waiver proceedings just

          to assert the clear statutory protections contained in sections

          211 and 212 is unwarranted.




               NRECA raises comparable questions with respect to waiver

          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001         -20-
            and RM94-7-002

               TANC declares that the safe harbor provisions do not cure

          the problems created by reciprocity.  It argues that the safe

          harbor provision expands the transmission access that must

          otherwise be offered by non-public utilities, i.e., rather than

          just providing reciprocal service to the transmission provider,

          under the safe harbor provision, the non-jurisdictional entity

          must offer open access to any eligible customers. 

               Blue Ridge alleges that the safe harbor and waiver

          provisions face practical administrative problems.  It asserts

          that a waiver itself will result in disputes and that the

          application of the waiver principle to non-public utilities is

          based on questionable statutory authority.  It requests that the

          Commission add the following language to section 6 of the tariff: 

          "If the Transmission Customer is a non-public utility, the

          Transmission Provider must demonstrate a need for transmission

          service from such entity." (Blue Ridge at 39).

               TAPS asks that the Commission accord the filing of a waiver

          application by a small non-public utility system, or inclusion in

          an application of a sworn statement of inapplicability, the same

          protections afforded larger non-public utility systems that file

          under the safe harbor mechanism.

               Arkansas Cities ask the Commission to clarify that

          "utilities like Arkansas Cities' members, which do not operate a

          control area, do not own 'transmission' facilities and primarily

          purchase energy for resale at retail are not subject to the

          transmission reciprocity condition contained in Order 888, and

            and RM94-7-002

          are also not required to file a request for a waiver from the

          requirements of Order 888 and 889." (Arkansas Cities at 18-19)

               SWRTA and NWRTA ask the Commission to clarify that RTGs have

          the authority to issue limited waivers of the reciprocity

          requirements of Order Nos. 888 and 889 to qualifying non-public

          utility members of RTGs, and that the Commission will accord

          deference to an RTG's determination with respect to a non-public

          utility member's request for waiver of, or exemption from, these

          requirements. 334/  They note that SWRTA's bylaws have a

          Commission-approved waiver process and disputes would go to

          arbitration or to the Commission.

               Southern and EEI argue that public utilities should have a

          parallel "safe harbor" -- the right to seek a declaratory order

          as to whether the transmission service being offered by a non-

          public utility satisfies its reciprocity obligation.

               Tallahassee asks that the Commission clarify the good faith

          assertion a public utility must make that the non-public utility

          has not met the reciprocity requirements.  It asserts that the

          section 211 good faith request rules form an appropriate standard

          by which to measure a good faith assertion.

               Commission Conclusion

               Several entities raise procedural and jurisdictional

          concerns with respect to our safe harbor and waiver provisions. 

          At the outset, we emphasize that this Commission does not have



               WRTA supports NWRTA in NWRTA's rehearing request.





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001         -22-
            and RM94-7-002

          jurisdiction over non-public utilities under sections 205 and 206

          and that the safe harbor mechanism and waiver provisions do not,

          and indeed cannot, give us such jurisdiction.  Rather the safe

          harbor and waiver procedures are voluntary means for non-public

          utilities to obtain a Commission determination that they meet the

          reciprocity condition in the open access tariffs and thereby

          avoid potential delays or denials of open access service based on

          allegations that the transmission requestor does not meet

          reciprocity.  In Santee Cooper, issued subsequent to the Final

          Rule, the Commission recognized that it lacks jurisdiction under

          sections 205 and 206 over transmission rates, terms and

          conditions offered by non-public utilities, but explained that it

          has the authority to evaluate non-jurisdictional activities to

          the extent they affect the Commission's jurisdictional

          responsibilities.

               We clarify that non-public utilities that disagree with a

          Commission determination are free to request rehearing of a

          Commission order, as occurred in Santee Cooper.  If aggrieved by

          the Commission's final order, they may appeal under section 313

          of the FPA.  Also, with respect to the filing fee a non-public

          utility entity would have to pay in making a declaratory order

          request, the Commission in Santee Cooper explained that its

          regulations specifically exempt states, municipalities and anyone

          who is engaged in the official business of the Federal Government





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001         -23-
            and RM94-7-002

          from filing fees. 335/  Because of the nature of the safe harbor

          and waiver provisions, we will also waive the filing fee for

          declaratory orders for all other non-public utilities in these

          circumstances.

               As to the question of how closely a reciprocal tariff will

          have to conform to Order No. 888, the Commission determined in

          Santee Cooper that:

                    As part of its compliance filing . . . the
                    Authority must submit a single tariff that
                    conforms to the Open Access Rule pro forma
                    tariff. [336/]

          The Commission further explained that "[t]he Open Access Rule

          requires that reciprocity tariffs contain terms and conditions

          which substantially conform or are superior to those in the Open

          Access Rule pro forma tariff." 337/  We clarify, however, that in

          that case the utility chose to offer an open access tariff,

          whereas Order No. 888 provides, as a condition of service, that

          reciprocal access be offered to only those transmission providers

          from whom the non-public utility obtains open access service. 

          Therefore, a non-public utility may so limit the use of any

          voluntarily offered tariff, as long as the tariff otherwise

          substantially conforms to the pro forma tariff.  We also note

          that non-public utilities are free to enter into bilateral

          agreements to satisfy the reciprocity condition.  With respect to


               75 FERC at 61,694-95 (citing 18 CFR 381.108).  

               75 FERC at 61,701.

          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001         -24-
            and RM94-7-002

          such bilateral reciprocal agreements, we must leave these

          agreements to case-by-case determinations.  Which terms and

          conditions may be necessary for a non-public utility to provide

          reciprocal service to the public utility in a bilateral agreement

          is necessarily a fact-specific matter not susceptible to

          resolution in a generic rulemaking proceeding.  Additionally, we

          clarify that non-public utilities may include stranded cost

          recovery provisions in any reciprocity tariffs that they may

          file. 338/

               In response to TANC's concern that the safe harbor provision

          expands the transmission access that must otherwise be offered by

          non-public utility entities, and Blue Ridge's concern that the

          safe harbor and waiver provisions raise practical administrative

          problems, we emphasize that both of these procedures are purely

          voluntary and a non-public utility can avoid any perceived

          problems simply by not taking part in either process.  We note

          that several entities have voluntarily availed themselves of

          these procedures without any apparent hardships. 339/  




               Because we have not extended the reciprocity condition to
               rate aspects of a non-public utility's tariff, we would not
               evaluate any stranded cost recovery mechanism and, as with
               respect to all terms and conditions of non-jurisdictional
               tariffs, the Commission is without jurisdiction to enforce
               such a charge.

               petition for declaratory order on October 17, 1996, which
               was docketed as NJ97-2-000), Southern Illinois Power
               Cooperative (filed petition for declaratory order on October

               Arkansas Cities' various waiver requests are best addressed

          on a case-by-case basis that permits a full airing of the factual

          circumstances surrounding each entity seeking a waiver.  As we

          explained in a recent order, "the Commission will not address

          waiver requests in a generic rulemaking proceeding, but will

          require entities seeking waiver of all or part of Order Nos. 888

          and 889 to submit separate, fact-specific requests. . . ." 340/  

               EEI's and Southern's request that public utilities be

          provided a parallel "safe harbor" (i.e., the right to seek a

          declaratory order as to whether the transmission service being

          offered by a non-public utility satisfies its reciprocity

          obligation) is denied.  In the Final Rule, we explained that a

          public utility may refuse to provide open access transmission

          service to a non-public utility if its denial is based on a good

          faith assertion that the non-public utility has not met the

          Commission's reciprocity requirements. 341/  Moreover, a public

          utility can file a petition to terminate transmission service if

          a non-public utility is violating the reciprocity condition of

          its open access service agreement with the public utility. 342/

               In response to SWRTA and NWRTA's request to clarify that

          RTGs have the authority to issue limited waivers of the

               FERC Stats. & Regs. at 31,761; mimeo at 372.

               For the same reason, we deny Tallahassee's request that we
               clarify the good faith assertion a public utility must make
               that the non-public utility has not met the reciprocity
               condition.

          reciprocity conditions of the Order No. 888 pro forma tariffs, we

          recognize that RTGs have procedures in place to resolve disputes

          that may arise concerning a non-public utility member's request

          for service from a public utility member.  Because RTGs have

          these dispute resolution procedures in place, we clarify that

          RTGs, which are in themselves reciprocal voluntary arrangements,

          may determine whether to apply reciprocity between and among

          member public utilities and member non-public utilities, subject

          to the RTG dispute resolution procedures authorized by this

          Commission.

               Rehearing Requests

                    Retail Wheeling

               Dairyland contends that the Commission improperly requires a

          non-public utility to provide retail wheeling if it uses the open

          access tariff of a public utility that allows retail access

          either voluntarily or as part of a state-mandated program.





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001         -27-
            and RM94-7-002

               Commission Conclusion

               Contrary to Dairyland's contention, nothing in the Final

          Rule requires a non-public utility to provide retail wheeling. 

          Section 212(h) of the FPA explicitly prohibits the Commission

          from ordering retail transmission directly to an ultimate

          consumer.  If a non-public utility offers reciprocal service, its

          tariff would have to include the same explicit provision

          contained in the pro forma tariff, which states that an eligible

          customer cannot obtain transmission that would violate section

          212(h) of the FPA, unless pursuant to a state program that

          requires the transmission provider to offer such wheeling.

               Rehearing Requests

                    OASIS

               Southern argues that the Commission should explicitly

          require that non-public utilities must comply with Order No. 889

          as part of the reciprocity obligation.

               Commission Conclusion

               We agree with Southern and, as discussed above, absent a

          waiver, will require non-public utilities to comply with Order

          No. 889 as part of the reciprocity obligation.

               Rehearing Requests

                    Foreign Entities

               In the Open Access Rule, we decided that a foreign entity

          that otherwise meets the eligibility criteria should be able to

          obtain service under a United States public utility's open access

          tariff.  However, like United States non-public utilities (which





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001         -28-
            and RM94-7-002

          also are not under our section 205-206 jurisdiction), a foreign

          entity that owns or controls transmission facilities and that

          takes transmission service under a United States public utility's

          open access tariff must comply with the reciprocity provision in

          the tariff. 343/  The reciprocity provision ensures that when a

          public utility provides service under its open access tariff to a

          transmission-owning entity that is not subject to the open access

          requirement, the public utility will be able to receive service

          in turn from that entity.  In our discussion of the reciprocity

          provision, we pointed out that if a non-jurisdictional entity

          that owns or controls transmission does not wish to provide

          service to the public utility, it can choose not to use the

          public utility's open access tariff and can instead seek

          voluntary service from the public utility on a contractual

          basis. 344/

               On rehearing, Ontario Hydro argues that the Commission has

          "unilateral[ly] impos[ed]" the reciprocity requirement on foreign

          entities in violation of the North American Free Trade Agreement

          (NAFTA). 345/  It declares that 

                    [u]nder the principle of national treatment,
                    the citizens of each party to NAFTA . . . are
                    allowed the same market access within another
                    treaty party's market as is provided to the
                    citizens of such other party.  A party to

                    these agreements cannot withhold access to
                    its market by conditioning it upon receipt of
                    equal access into the market of another
                    party, because the result would be market
                    access less favorable for the other party . .
                    . than that accorded the party's own
                    citizens. [346/]

               Ontario Hydro claims that the Open Access Rule "makes open

          access the law of the land for wholesale transmission service

          within the United States . . ." and that Canadian entities are

          thus entitled to such access on an unconditional basis. 347/ 

          Next, it accuses the Commission of trying to "coerce" Canada to

          "conform its market access policy" to United States policy and of

          "impos[ing] U.S. regulatory policies" on Canadian markets. 348/ 

          Finally, Ontario Hydro argues that even aside from the NAFTA

          issue, under the FPA the Commission does not have jurisdiction

          over foreign entities and thus cannot require reciprocity. 

               Commission Conclusion

               We disagree with Ontario Hydro's claim that NAFTA's national

          treatment principle requires us to allow a Canadian transmission-

          owning entity (or its corporate affiliate) to take advantage of a

          United States public utility's open access tariff -- a tariff we

          have required the utility to adopt -- while simultaneously

          refusing to allow the United States utility to use the Canadian

          entity's transmission facilities.  NAFTA's national treatment

          principle requires that each signatory "accord national treatment

          to the goods" of other signatories in accordance with Article III

          of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 349/ 

          National treatment means that the United States "must not

          discriminate between foreign and domestic energy on the basis of

          nationality . . ." and that Canadian electricity must be treated

          "no less favorabl[y] than U.S. electricity, under all U.S. laws

          and rules respecting the sale, . . . distribution, and use of . .

          . electricity."  Thus, this Commission must accord Canadian

          energy supplies treatment that is no less favorable than the

          treatment accorded United States supplies. 350/  Ontario Hydro's

          interpretation, however, would twist this principle into a

          requirement that Canadian entities be treated better than United

          States entities, including United States non-public utilities

          that are subject to the reciprocity condition. 351/

               We have no section 205-206 jurisdiction over non-public
               United States utilities, just as we have no jurisdiction
               over foreign entities.  Ontario Hydro's claim that the Open
          Access Rule "makes open access the law of the land for wholesale
          transmission service within the United States" is wrong; open
          access is not the law of the land for United States non-public





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001         -31-
            and RM94-7-002

               Under Order No. 888, all public utility open access tariffs

          contain a reciprocity condition that applies to all users of the

          tariff within the United States, including United States non-

          public utilities, unless the condition is waived either by the

          Commission or the public utility provider.  Under the reciprocity

          condition, non-public utilities do not have to offer an open

          access tariff (i.e., a tariff that offers transmission service to

          any eligible customer), but rather must offer comparable

          transmission services only to those transmission providers whose

          open access tariffs the non-public utility uses. 352/  The same

          condition applies to foreign utilities.  Thus, Ontario Hydro is

          in plain error in arguing that application of the reciprocity

          condition to foreign entities would result in less favorable

          treatment than that accorded to United States citizens.  Ontario

          Hydro's reading of NAFTA would place transmission-owning Canadian

          entities (or their corporate affiliates) in a better position

          than any domestic entity; not only would Canadian entities not be

          subject to the open access requirement, but, unlike domestic non-

          public utilities, they would be able to use the open access

          tariffs we have mandated without providing any reciprocal





          utilities, since we have no section 205-206 jurisdiction over
          them.

               United States public utilities, of course, are separately
               required by Order No. 888 to have on file open access
               tariffs and thus meet reciprocity through the separate, more
               stringent open access requirement.

          service.  Ontario Hydro has cited no precedent demonstrating that

          NAFTA imposes such an unreasonable requirement. 353/  

               Moreover, we are not "coercing" Canada into adopting our

          policies or "imposing" open access on Canadian entities; we are

          simply placing the same condition on a Canadian entity's use of a

          United States utility's open access tariff as on a domestic non-

          public utility's use of that tariff.  However, consistent with

          the approach we have taken in other contexts involving foreign

          utilities seeking to transact in United States electricity

          markets, we are amenable to a variety of approaches for Canadian

          utilities to meet the reciprocity condition. 354/

               Ontario Hydro is also wrong in its claim that even aside

          from NAFTA, we lack authority under the FPA to require

          reciprocity when a foreign entity wishes to use a domestic

          utility's open access tariff.  Just as we are not asserting

          jurisdiction over domestic non-public utilities under sections

          205 or 206 of the FPA, we also are not asserting jurisdiction


               Ontario Hydro also complains that the reciprocity obligation
               of domestic non-public utilities is subject to various
               limitations and waiver provisions.  These provisions apply
               to foreign entities as well.

               In recent cases involving the mitigation of transmission
               market power of Canadian utilities that are affiliates of
               power marketers that seek to sell power at market-based
               rates in the United States, the Commission has explicitly
               acknowledged the sovereign authority of Canadian governments
               over Canadian entities and has said that we will be
               "amenable to a variety of approaches" for foreign utilities
               to mitigate transmission market power.  British Columbia

                    Unconstitutional as Applied to NE Public Power District

               NE Public Power District asserts that the reciprocity

          provision as applied to NE Public Power District (a public

          corporation and political and governmental subdivision under

          Nebraska law) is unconstitutional.  It argues that reciprocity

          would intrude into the sovereignty of Nebraska and would negate

          the decision of Nebraska's citizens to use their own governmental

          institutions to provide electric service.  Moreover, contrary to

          the Commission's assertion, NE Public Power District states that

          it does not have a real choice in deciding whether to use the

          transmission service of public utilities.  Because it is beyond

          the power of Congress to compel Nebraska to adopt a federally

          prescribed program for providing its citizens with electric

          utility services, NE Public Power District argues that it must

          follow that a federal agency lacks the constitutional and


               EEI and Ontario Hydro note that section 6 of the tariff
               limits the obligation of foreign utilities to provide
               reciprocal service to "facilities used for transmission of
               electric energy in interstate commerce owned, controlled or
               operated by the Transmission Customer. . . ." (EEI at 14). 
               This is inconsistent with the preamble, which says that the
               reciprocity provision applies to foreign entities (whose
               transmission facilities may not be "interstate").  We
               recognize that the language in section 6 of the pro forma
               tariff conflicts with the preamble language of the Final
               Rule.  We are modifying section 6 of the tariff accordingly.

          statutory authority to compel a Nebraska state instrumentality to

          adopt a FERC-drafted tariff and to modify its contracts. 

               NE Public Power District states that section 201(f) of the

          FPA exempts state-owned utilities from the jurisdiction of the

          Commission and that sections 211-213 are the exclusive means by

          which the Commission can require non-public utilities to perform

          involuntary transmission service.  It asserts that the Commission

          should exempt publicly-owned utilities from application of the

          Final Rule and notes that virtually all non-public utility

          entities are, or soon will be, voluntary participants in power

          pools, RTGs, or other similar organizations.  Thus, NE Public

          Power District argues that there is no compelling public interest

          to require these entities now to submit to the reciprocity

          provision.

               In addition, NE Public Power District argues that compliance

          would conflict with Nebraska law and bond covenants, i.e.,

          Nebraska law, for example, does not permit a public entity to

          agree in advance of a dispute to submit to binding arbitration. 

          NE Public Power District states that it is bound by a bond

          covenant that prohibits it from rendering service free of charge

          and requires that a customer's default must be cured within a

          specific time.  It also argues that these requirements are in

          conflict with section 7.3 of the pro forma tariff.

               Commission Conclusion

               Under the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, Nebraska law

          cannot and does not override this Commission's authorities and

          responsibilities under the FPA.  Rather, this Commission has

          exclusive jurisdiction over the rates, terms and conditions of

          transmission in interstate commerce by public utilities,

          including reciprocity conditions contained in the tariffs of

          public utilities.  Nothing in Order No. 888 compels Nebraska to

          adopt a "federally prescribed program."  While we do not have

          full jurisdiction over non-public utilities, 356/ our actions in

          regulating jurisdictional matters may impact those who wish to

          use jurisdictional services or to enter into agreements with

          public utilities.  The Commission's obligation is to ensure that

          public utilities' services are just and reasonable and not unduly

          discriminatory or preferential and non-public utilities can

          choose to comply or not regarding matters within our exclusive

          jurisdiction.  Moreover, as we explained above, NE Public Power

          District can seek waiver of the reciprocity condition on a case-

          by-case basis.

                    QF Position

               American Forest & Paper asks the Commission to clarify that

          QFs are exempted from the reciprocity requirement or, in the



               We do have jurisdiction over many non-public utilities under
               certain sections of the FPA, e.g., sections 210, 211 and
               212.





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001         -36-
            and RM94-7-002

          alternative, grant them a blanket waiver.  It states that QFs are

          not allowed to provide transmission service for third parties. 

          Moreover, it asserts that there are unlikely to be many requests

          for transmission service over a QF's interconnection line and

          such cases should be handled on a case-by-case basis.

               Commission Conclusion

               We will not grant QFs an exemption from the reciprocity

          condition or grant them a blanket waiver, but will address this

          issue on a case-by-case basis if and when it arises.  Because

          most QFs own little transmission, it is not likely that they will

          be asked to provide reciprocal service.

               Furthermore, in a proceeding involving a QF, we explained

          that use of a QF's transmission line by a non-QF would not affect

          its QF status:

                    It would not fail the ownership test for QF
                    status because, consistent with the
                    requirements of the Public Utility Regulatory
                    Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA), the Oxbow
                    Geothermal facility would continue to be
                    "owned by a person not primarily engaged in
                    the generation or sale of electric power
                    (other than electric power solely from

                         Reciprocity and Private Activity Bonds

               EEI asks the Commission to require non-public utilities

          claiming that their tax status is a bar to granting reciprocity

          to substantiate such claim in a safe harbor proceeding and to

          take reasonable measures to request the IRS to allow them to

          provide reciprocal service while retaining their tax status.  If

          the Commission decides not to require a safe harbor proceeding,

          EEI requests that the Commission require non-public utilities to

          substantiate their tax concerns and to demonstrate to each public

          utility from which they seek service that they are actively

          pursuing the issue with the IRS. 359/  It also urges that the

          Commission require any request for exemption from the reciprocity

          requirement that is based on jeopardy to tax-exempt status be

          filed with the Commission as part of a request for declaratory

          order in a safe harbor proceeding.  Moreover, it requests that

               Centerior asks that the Commission condition receipt of open

          access transmission service by municipal utilities upon the

          elimination or mitigation of tax subsidies and regulatory

          inequities.  Southern maintains that tax-exempt status can remain

          undisturbed if non-public utilities do not seek open access

          transmission service from public utilities.  Thus, Southern

          asserts, non-public utilities can weigh the benefits of

          transmission service under the Final Rule against the potential

          threat to their tax benefits, and make the choice that serves

          their best interest.  At a minimum, it argues, the Commission

          should await the determinations of the IRS before finalizing this

          aspect of the reciprocity provision, rather than confer yet

          another unique benefit on non-public utilities. 360/   

               CAMU asks that the Commission defer reciprocity obligations

          until the IRS has clarified the status of private use limitations

          within the context of transmission access.  Otherwise, CAMU

          asserts, innocent investors could suffer penalties because the

          Commission moved too quickly on this sensitive issue.

               transitional period that provides an opportunity for the IRS
               and/or Congress to address the interrelationship between
               open access transmission and tax-exempt financing.

                         Local Furnishing Bonds

               Local Furnishing Utilities and ConEd state that section 5.1

          of the pro forma tariff applies to "Transmission Service," which

          is defined in section 1.48 to include point-to-point service, but

          not network service.  They ask the Commission to clarify that the

          phrase "transmission service" also applies to network service.

               Local Furnishing Utilities and ConEd ask that the Commission

          confirm that all costs associated with the loss of tax-exempt

          status, including defeasing, redeeming, and refinancing tax-

          exempt bonds, will be considered costs of providing transmission

          that must be borne by the customer for whom the transmission is

          provided.  They state that defeasance and refinancing costs are

          just as attributable to the particular transmission service

          causing such defeasance or redemption as the costs of expanding

          the system are attributable to the service that cause the need

          for such expansion.  They ask that the Commission clarify that a

          transmission provider may include in its tariff a provision

          permitting the recovery of such costs, even if a filing under

          section 205 of the FPA is required.  ConEd asserts that if a

          customer does not want to pay costs associated with the loss of

          tax-exempt status on the bonds, the Commission should allow the

          transmission provider to decline to provide the requested

          service.

               Local Furnishing Utilities and ConEd also assert that

          section 5.2 of the pro forma tariff should be clarified to state

          that issuance of a section 211 order by the Commission is a

            and RM94-7-002

          condition precedent to the provision of transmission service. 

          Local Furnishing Utilities states that there is a question

          whether the Commission should insist on waiver of the issuance of

          a proposed order under section 212(c).  According to Local

          Furnishing Utilities, the negotiations that normally would follow

          the issuance of a proposed order are likely to provide the only

          opportunity to demonstrate and review the costs associated with

          the loss of tax-exempt status.

               Local Furnishing Utilities and ConEd assert that sections

          5.1 and 5.2(i) of the pro forma tariff improperly limit the safe

          harbor protection of section 1919 of EPAct to transmission

          providers that financed "transmission facilities" with local

          furnishing bonds.  Because of this, they assert, the safe harbor

          is not available to ConEd, all of whose local furnishing bonds

          have been used to finance its distribution system.  They argue

          that section 5.1 should apply to service that would jeopardize

          the tax-exempt status of bonds that finance distribution or

          generation, as well as transmission, facilities.  NE Public Power

          District contends that section 5.2(ii) should be amended "to make

          it clear that interim service need not be begun if rendering the

          service would endanger the tax-exempt status of the provider's

          bonds, unless the customer agrees to bear the financial

          consequences of such loss of tax-exempt status and has the

          wherewithal to do so." (NE Public Power District at 22-23).

               Commission Conclusion

                    Private Activity Bonds

               As we explained in Order No. 888, it is not our purpose to

          disturb Congress's and the IRS's determinations with respect to

          tax-exempt financing.  With respect to private activity bonds, we

          reaffirm our finding that reciprocal service will not be required

          if providing such service would jeopardize the tax-exempt status

          of the transmission customer's (or its corporate affiliates')

          bonds used to finance such transmission facilities.  We remain

          hopeful that the IRS in its private activity bond rulemaking

          will, to the maximum extent possible, remove regulatory

          impediments that limit the ability of industry participants to

          provide reciprocal open access.  As we indicated in Order No.

          888, after the IRS acts, we will reexamine our policy to ensure

          that the reciprocity condition is applied broadly to achieve open

          access without jeopardizing tax-exempt financing. 361/

          granting reciprocity.  As we stated in Order No. 888, if a non-

          public utility has sought a declaratory order on a voluntarily-

          filed tariff, we request that it identify the services, if any,

          that it cannot provide without jeopardizing the tax-exempt status

          of its financing.  However, we cannot require that a non-public

          utility use the safe harbor mechanism, whether to file a

          reciprocal tariff with the Commission or to substantiate a claim

          as to loss of tax-exempt status.  As we explain above, the safe

          harbor procedure is a voluntary means for non-public utilities to

          obtain a Commission determination that they meet the reciprocity

          condition in the open access tariffs and thereby avoid potential

          delays or denials of open access service based on allegations

          that the transmission requestor does not meet reciprocity.

               Nevertheless, just as we believe that it is appropriate to

          condition the use of public utility open access tariffs on the

          agreement of the tariff user to provide reciprocal access to the

          transmission provider, we also believe it is appropriate to

          condition the use of public utility open access tariffs on the

          agreement of the non-public utility tariff user to substantiate

          any claim that providing reciprocal transmission service would

          jeopardize the tax-exempt status of its financing.  The non-

          public utility can provide such substantiation by identifying for

          the customer the services that it cannot provide without

          jeopardizing its tax-exempt financing. 362/  

               Southern suggests that tax-exempt status can remain

          undisturbed if non-public utilities do not seek open access

          transmission service from public utilities and, therefore, that

          non-public utilities can weigh the benefits of transmission

          service under the Rule against the potential threat to their tax

          benefits.  We believe it is important to remember why we required

          open access in the first place -- as a remedy for undue

          discrimination in transmission services in interstate commerce. 

          Southern would force a non-public utility to give up a

          Congressionally-mandated right as a condition to taking open

          access transmission.  Clearly Southern's suggestion is misplaced

          and overbroad. 363/  For this reason, we believe that our


               In response to EEI's request that the Commission require a
               non-public utility to provide copies of, and specifically
               reference the tax provisions in, the related financing
               agreements, we note that the level of detail needed to
               substantiate a non-public utility's claim that providing
               reciprocal transmission service would jeopardize the tax-
               exempt status of its financing is likely to depend on the
               facts of each case.  As a result, what will constitute
               adequate substantiation is properly determined on a case-by-
               case basis.  Additionally, we will reject EEI's request that
               the Commission require non-public utilities to demonstrate
               that they are actively pursuing the issue with the IRS.  As
               we explain above, the IRS is currently examining these
               issues; we in turn will reexamine our policy after the IRS
               acts to ensure that the reciprocity condition is applied
               broadly to achieve open access without jeopardizing tax-
               exempt financing.

               We will reject Centerior's request that the Commission
               condition receipt of open access transmission service by
               non-public utilities upon the elimination or mitigation of
          tax subsidies.  As we stated in Order No. 888, Congress has





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001         -44-
            and RM94-7-002

          decision not to require reciprocal service if providing such

          service would jeopardize the non-public utility's tax-exempt

          financing -- pending action by the IRS in its private activity

          bond rulemaking -- is appropriate for the time being. 364/  We

          reiterate that we will reexamine our policy after the IRS acts. 

          As we state above, we believe that ultimately the public interest

          is best served by nationwide open access.

                         Local Furnishing Bonds

               We clarify, in response to Local Furnishing Utilities and

          ConEd, that the reference to "Transmission Service" in section

          5.1 of the pro forma tariff was intended to be to "transmission

          service," and thereby to apply to point-to-point service as well

          as network service.  We have revised section 5.1 accordingly.

               We further clarify that all costs associated with the loss

          of tax-exempt status, including the costs of defeasing,

          redeeming, and refinancing tax-exempt bonds, are properly

          considered costs of providing transmission services.  Therefore,

          a customer that takes service, understanding that such service

          will result in loss of tax-exempt status, shall be responsible

          for such costs to the extent consistent with Commission policy,


          entrusted the IRS with the responsibility for implementing laws
          governing tax-exempt financing, and it is not this Commission's
          purpose to disturb Congress's and the IRS's determinations in
          that regard.

               In response to CAMU, we note that the Commission has, in
               effect, deferred -- pending IRS action -- a non-public
               utility's reciprocity obligation in cases in which the
               provision of reciprocal service would jeopardize the tax-
               exempt status of the non-public utility's financing. 





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001         -45-
            and RM94-7-002

          and a transmission provider may include in its tariff a provision

          permitting it to seek recovery of such costs.  We clarify that if

          the transmission customer is not willing to pay the costs

          associated with the transmission provider's loss of tax-exempt

          status, the transmission provider will not be required to provide

          the requested service. 365/

               Local Furnishing Utilities and ConEd also ask the Commission

          to revise section 5.2 of the pro forma tariff to state that

          issuance of a section 211 order by the Commission is a condition

          precedent to the provision of transmission service.  Under the

          tariff provision adopted by Order No. 888 to address situations

          in which the provision of transmission service would jeopardize

          the tax-exempt status of any local furnishing bonds used to

          finance a local furnishing utility's facilities, the customer

          requesting transmission service would tender an application under

          section 211 of the FPA.  Within ten days of receiving a copy of

          the section 211 application, the transmission provider "will

          waive its rights to a request for service under Section 213(a) of

          the [FPA] and to the issuance of a proposed order under Section

          212(c) of the [FPA] and shall provide the requested transmission

          service in accordance with the terms and conditions of this

          Tariff." 366/  We clarify that the Commission, upon receipt of



               Of course if the transmission provider can provide part of
               the requested service without jeopardizing tax-exempt
               status, it should offer to provide such service.

               Pro Forma Open Access Transmission Tariff, Section 5.2(ii).





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001         -46-
            and RM94-7-002

          the transmission provider's waiver of its rights to a request for

          service under section 213(a) and to the issuance of a proposed

          order under section 212(c), shall issue an order under section

          211. 367/  Upon issuance of the order under section 211, the

          transmission provider shall be required to provide the requested

          transmission service in accordance with the terms and conditions

          of the tariff.  Section 5.2 of the pro forma tariff has been

          revised accordingly. 

               Local Furnishing Utilities and ConEd also contend that the

          language of sections 5.1 and 5.2(i) of the pro forma tariff

          improperly limits the safe harbor protection of section 1919 of

          EPAct to transmission providers that financed transmission

          facilities with local furnishing bonds.  ConEd expresses concern

          that although all of its electric local furnishing bonds have


               We will reject Local Furnishing Utilities' request that the
               Commission reconsider whether it should insist on the
               transmission provider's waiver of the issuance of a proposed
               order under section 212(c).  As Order No. 888 indicates,
               this aspect of the local furnishing provision of the tariff
               is similar to a provision included in the transmission
               tariff of San Diego G&E, one of the Local Furnishing
               Utilities.  Waiver of the issuance of a proposed order
               enables a transmission provider to expeditiously provide
               service under section 5.2 of the pro forma tariff, thereby
               ensuring that any local furnishing bonds that may exist do
               not interfere with the effective operation of an open access
               transmission regime.  Although Local Furnishing Utilities
               now apparently support the issuance of a proposed order on
               the basis that the negotiations that normally would follow
               are likely to provide an opportunity to review the costs
               associated with the loss of tax-exempt status, we believe
               that any dispute as to costs subsequently can be resolved
               without causing any delay in the provision of the requested
               transmission service.  For example, the service could be
               provided at the maximum rate allowed by the Commission,
               subject to refund. 





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001         -47-
            and RM94-7-002

          been used to finance its distribution system, the test as to

          whether those bonds have been used for the "local furnishing" of

          electricity is based in part on whether ConEd has been a "net

          importer" of energy into its service territory.  As a result,

          ConEd argues that the use of its transmission system to wheel

          power from a generating source located inside ConEd's service

          territory to a customer located outside its service territory

          could cause ConEd to violate the net importer rule and thereby

          lose the tax exemption for the bonds used to finance its

          distribution system.  ConEd asks the Commission to modify

          sections 5.1 and 5.2 of the pro forma tariff to make clear that

          those provisions apply to transmission providers that have

          financed any "facilities" (i.e., distribution and generation, not

          just transmission, facilities) with local furnishing bonds.

               As we explained in Order No. 888, we believe the local

          furnishing bonds provision in section 5 of the pro forma tariff

          is necessary and appropriate so that any local furnishing bonds

          that may exist do not interfere with the effective operation of

          an open access transmission regime.  If the provision of

          transmission service pursuant to Order No. 888 would result in

          the loss of tax-exempt status for local furnishing bonds,

          regardless of whether the facilities financed with those bonds

          are transmission, distribution, or generation facilities, it is

          our intent that the provisions of section 5 would apply.  Thus,

          we clarify in response to ConEd and Local Furnishing Utilities

          that, to the extent the provision of transmission under an open





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001         -48-
            and RM94-7-002

          access tariff would jeopardize the tax-exempt status of local

          furnishing bonds used to finance distribution or generation

          facilities (even if no transmission facilities were financed with

          such bonds), 368/ such situation would fall within the reference

          to "facilities that would be used in providing . . . transmission

          service" contained in sections 5.1 and 5.2(i).  This is so

          because the loss of tax-exempt status in such circumstances would

          be directly attributable to the provision of transmission

          services under the Rule.  

               Further, we said in Order No. 888 that "we will require any

          public utility that is subject to the Open Access Rule that has

          financed transmission facilities with local furnishing bonds to



               ConEd suggests that this might occur if, for example, the
               provision by ConEd of transmission service were to cause it
               to violate the net importer rule and thereby lose the tax
               exemption for bonds used to finance its local distribution
               system.  Although we clarify above that section 5 of the pro
               forma tariff would apply to this situation, we note that it
               is not clear that wheeling required by the Commission would
               be counted for purposes of determining whether a public
               utility is a "net importer."  In its committee report on the
               bill that became the Energy Policy Act, the House Ways and
               Means Committee stated:
          
                    The committee believes further that, in applying the
                    IRS ruling position that a local furnishing utility
                    that is interconnected with other utilities (other than
                    for emergency transfers of electricity) must be a net
                    importer of electricity, the determination of whether
                    the utility is a net importer should be made without
                    regard to electricity generated by another party that
                    is wheeled by the utility to a point outside its
                    service area pursuant to a FERC order authorized under
                    the bill.

          statement that the section 5 local furnishing bonds provision

          would only apply to public utilities that have financed

          transmission facilities with local furnishing bonds, and not

          those that have financed generation and distribution facilities

          with such bonds.  As we explain above, it is our intent that the

          provisions of section 5 apply if the provision of transmission

          service pursuant to an open access tariff would result in the

          loss of tax-exempt status for local furnishing bonds, regardless

          of whether the facilities financed with those bonds are

          transmission, distribution, or generation facilities.

          agencies, as defined in 44 U.S.C.  3502 (10)." 375/  In section

          3502(10), the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is defined as

          an independent regulatory agency.  As a result, the Executive

          Order does not apply to the Commission.

               The Act similarly applies to federal agencies, but, as with

          the Executive Order, does not apply to independent regulatory

          agencies. 376/  Although the Act does not define "independent

          regulatory agency," there is no indication that Congress intended

          to exclude the Commission from the definition.  In fact, in all

          instances in which Congress has defined the term "independent

          regulatory agency" of which we are aware, the Commission has been

          included.

               As noted, the Commission is defined as an independent

          regulatory agency in Title 44 U.S.C.  Also, Title 42 U.S.C. 

          7176 provides that:

                    For the purposes of chapter 9 of title 5,
                    United States Code . . . [Executive
                    Reorganization], the [Federal Energy
                    Regulatory] Commission shall be deemed to be
                    an independent regulatory agency. [377/]

          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001         -52-
            and RM94-7-002

          Accordingly, we find that the Commission is an independent

          regulatory agency as used in the Act; therefore, it is not

          covered by the Act.

               Moreover, even if the Act applied to the Commission, the

          Final Rule will not impose a Federal mandate on state, local or

          tribal governments.

               Section 305 of the Act defines a "Federal mandate" as:

                    any provision in [a] statute or regulation or
                    [in] any Federal court ruling that imposes an
                    enforceable duty upon State, local, or tribal
                    governments[,] including a condition of
                    Federal assistance or a duty arising from
                    participation in a voluntary Federal program.
                    [378/]

               The Open Access Final Rule imposes requirements only on

          certain public utilities 379/ and, pursuant to section 201(f) of

          the FPA, state and local governments, and their agencies,

          authorities and instrumentalities, are not public utilities. 

          Additionally, although the Final Rule will allow public

          utilities' transmission tariffs to contain reciprocity provisions

          in order to ensure that public utilities offering open access

          transmission to others can obtain similar service from open

          access users, the reciprocity provision is not an enforceable

          duty.  A duty is mandatory; it is an obligation to perform and is




               109 Stat. 70 (to be codified at 2 U.S.C.  1555)(emphasis
               supplied).

               I.e., those that own, operate or control interstate
               transmission facilities and do not obtain a waiver from the
               Commission.





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001         -53-
            and RM94-7-002

          compulsory. 380/  The reciprocity provision is merely a condition

          of receiving a benefit, i.e., open access transmission service

          from a public utility. 381/  There is no requirement that NE

          Public Power District promulgate an open access tariff and apply

          to FERC for a declaratory order.  Moreover, as we explained

          above, non-public utilities, such as NE Public Power District,

          are free to seek from a public utility a waiver of the open

          access tariff reciprocity condition.

               With regard to the Stranded Cost Final Rule, while it

          applies to non-public utilities as well as public utilities, it

          does not impose a duty on any entity since it merely permits

          public utilities and transmitting utilities to seek recovery of

          certain costs.  As a result, since the Open Access and Stranded

          Cost final rules will not impose an enforceable duty on state,

          municipal or tribal power agencies such as NE Public Power

          District, the rules are not Federal mandates as defined in the

          Act.

               A state or municipal power authority, such as NE Public
               Power District, does not have to agree to reciprocity, and
               the Commission cannot force it to do so.  The Commission is
               not requiring state or municipal power authorities to
               provide transmission access.  If non-public utilities elect
               not to take advantage of open access services because they
               don't want to meet the tariff reciprocity provision, they
               can still seek voluntary, bilateral transmission service
               from public utilities.





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001         -54-
            and RM94-7-002

               Because the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 does not

          apply to the Commission and, in any event, the Open

          Access/Stranded Cost final rules do not impose Federal mandates

          on state, local or tribal governments, we reject NE Public Power

          District's argument that the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995

          is applicable here.

                    5.   Liability and Indemnification

               In the Final Rule, the Commission explained that the

          indemnification provision was broken into two parts (set forth in

          section 10.1 (Force Majeure) and section 10.2 (Indemnification)

          of the pro forma tariff). 382/  The Commission explained that the

          first part is a force majeure provision which provides that

          neither the transmission provider nor the customer will be in

          default if a force majeure event occurs, but also provides that

          both the transmission provider and customer will take all

          reasonable steps to comply with the tariff despite the occurrence

          of a force majeure event.

               The Commission explained that the second portion of the

          provision provides for indemnification against third party claims

          arising from the performance of obligations under the tariff. 

          The Commission limited the indemnification portion of the

          provision so that it is only the transmission customer who

          indemnifies the transmission provider from the claims of third

          parties.  The Commission explained that the revised provision

          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001         -55-
            and RM94-7-002

          provides that the customer will not be required to indemnify the

          transmission provider in the case of negligence or intentional

          wrongdoing by the transmission provider.

               Rehearing Requests

               A number of utilities argue that the Commission has expanded

          transmitter liability beyond the existing standard in the

          industry, i.e., gross negligence. 383/  They assert that the

          Commission has provided no basis to subject transmission

          providers to liability, including consequential damages, due to

          ordinary negligence.  KCPL points out that 21 of 25 states

          addressing this issue hold that a utility should not be liable

          for ordinary negligence.  It declares that society will be worse

          off in litigation expenses and wasted human resources if

          utilities are held liable for simple negligence. It adds that the

          electric industry is much more susceptible to liability from

          interruptions of service than gas pipelines (refuting the

          Commission's reliance on Pacific Interstate Offshore Company,

          which it states is traceable to United Gas Pipeline Co. v. FERC,

          824 F.2d 417 (5th Cir. 1987)).  Florida Power Corp asks the

          Commission to modify section 10.2 to provide that a customer must

          indemnify the transmission provider except where a finder of fact

          determines that the transmission provider has committed gross or

          intentional wrongdoing.  It also argues that the Commission

               Corp.





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001         -56-
            and RM94-7-002

          should eliminate liability of both the transmission provider and

          the customer to the other for consequential damages.

               Southern argues that the exception language in section 10.2 

          should be changed to "except where a court has determined that

          the Transmission Provider has engaged in intentional wrongdoing

          or has been grossly negligent." (Southern at 20-21).  Southern

          also argues that the Commission should limit consequential

          damages arising from negligence in the operation of the

          transmission system.

               Puget asserts that the exception language in section 10.2

          should be changed to "except in cases of and to the extent of

          comparative or contributory negligence or intentional wrongdoing

          by the Transmission Provider." (Puget at 18).  It also asserts

          that the Commission should exclude liability for special,

          incidental, consequential, or indirect damages. 

               EEI argues that the Commission should add a new section

          10.3:  "If the Transmission Provider is found liable for any

          damages associated with this Tariff, those damages shall be

          limited to direct damages, and the Transmission Provider shall

          not be liable for any special, indirect or consequential damages

          of any nature by virtue of the transactions conducted under this

          Tariff."  (EEI at 26).

               Coalition for Economic Competition argues that the

          Commission should modify section 10.2 to provide that the

          transmission provider will not be liable to a transmission

          customer or any third party for damages caused by interruptions





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001         -57-
            and RM94-7-002

          or irregular or defective service, except if gross negligence or

          wilful misconduct caused such damages. 384/  Coalition for

          Economic Competition asserts that the definition of force majeure

          should include ordinary negligence and asks that the Commission

          clarify that a utility is not liable for force majeure events.

               CCEM also argues that transmission customer indemnity in

          section 10.2 should attach only to legal actions brought by

          customers of the transmission customer or third-party

          beneficiaries of those customers.

               On the other hand, TDU Systems argues that the indemnity

          provision unfairly provides the transmission provider with

          virtually total indemnification for acts on its side of the

          delivery point, but provides no reciprocal protection to the

          transmission customers for damage incurred on the customers'

          system in connection with purchasing the transmission provider's

          services.

               CSW Operating Companies asks the Commission to revise the

          pro forma tariff to provide that a transmission provider will not

          be liable for errors in an estimate made in good faith and in

          accordance with its published procedure.  They propose the

          following language:  

                    Information posted on the OASIS concerning
                    the availability of transfer capability will
                    be based on the Transmission Provider's best
                    estimates given the information readily and


               See also EEI at 26 (suggesting "except in cases of a finding
               by a trier of fact of gross negligence or intentional
               wrongdoing by the Transmission Provider"). 





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001         -58-
            and RM94-7-002

                    actually available to the transmission
                    provider.  No such estimate will be binding
                    on the Transmission Provider for any purpose.

          Alternatively, they ask the Commission to clarify that as long as

          a transmission provider in good faith follows its published

          methodology for determining ATC and TTC it will be deemed not to

          be negligent.

               Commission Conclusion

               The purpose of the force majeure provision in the pro forma

          tariff is to ensure that neither the customer nor the

          transmission provider is held in default in the event of an

          unpredictable and uncontrollable force majeure event.  It was not

          the Commission's intention that the force majeure clause provide

          an avenue for a party to claim that it is excused from liability

          for its own negligence.  A force majeure event does not include

          an act of negligence or intentional wrongdoing.  The pro forma

          tariff will be changed accordingly. 385/  

               The purpose of the indemnification provision is to allocate

          the risks of a transaction, and the costs associated with those

          risks, to the party on whose behalf the transaction has been

          conducted, the transmission customer.  As the tariff does not

          obligate the customer to perform services on behalf of the



               See Tex-La Electric Cooperative of Texas, Inc., 69 FERC 
               61,269 (1994) (requiring clarification that force majeure
               clause in electric transmission agreement does not excuse
               negligence); Avoca Natural Gas Storage, 68 FERC  61,045
               (1994) (requiring modification of force majeure provision to
               ensure that parties would be liable for negligence or
               intentional wrongdoing).





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001         -59-
            and RM94-7-002

          transmission provider, there is no comparable basis for imposing

          an indemnification obligation on the transmission provider. 386/ 

               As is explained in the Final Rule, the Commission does not

          believe it appropriate to extend the indemnification obligation

          so that it would apply even in cases where the transmission

          provider has been negligent.  The contention that electric

          transmission outages are either more frequent or more costly than

          gas outages does not serve to distinguish the electric

          transmission situation from the gas pipeline cases in which the

          Commission has found that indemnification clauses should not

          protect the pipeline owner from its own negligence. 387/  In

          either case, it would be inappropriate to require the customer to

          indemnify the transmission provider from damages arising from the

          transmission provider's own negligence.  We note, however, that

          liability is a separate issue from indemnification.  Despite the

          absence of indemnification protection, there is nothing in the

          indemnification provision that would preclude transmission

          providers from relying on the protection of state laws, when and

          where applicable, protecting utilities or others from claims

          founded in ordinary negligence.


               The Commission notes that in the past it may have accepted
               agreements containing gross negligence in force majeure and
               indemnification provisions.  Consistent with the
               Commission's general policy of not abrogating existing
               contracts, we leave those provisions undisturbed.

               See, e.g.,  Pacific Interstate Offshore Company, 62 FERC 
               61,260 at 62,733-734 (1993) (requiring amendment of
               indemnification provisions that required indemnification
               except in cases of "gross negligence").





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001         -60-
            and RM94-7-002

               With respect to the issue of consequential and indirect

          damages, the indemnification provision already provides

          protection to the transmission provider from consequential and

          indirect damage claims by third parties except in cases of

          negligence or intentional wrongdoing by the transmission

          provider.  The Commission sees no need to further extend this

          protection.  Again, we note that liability is a separate issue

          from indemnification, and that nothing in these provisions

          precludes transmission providers or customers from relying, when

          and where such law is applicable, on the protection of statutes

          or other law protecting parties from consequential or indirect

          damages.

               Furthermore, we will not revise the pro forma tariff, as

          requested by CSW Operating Companies, to provide that a

          transmission provider will not be liable for errors in an

          estimate made in good faith or in accordance with its published

          procedure.  We believe that a utility should have no different a

          liability standard for operating an OASIS than for its other

          operations. 388/

               The Commission received requests for clarification regarding

          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001         -61-
            and RM94-7-002

               SoCal Edison argues that it is too burdensome to require a

          separate Completed Application and a separate Service Agreement

          to be executed for each individual service transaction for short-

          term firm and non-firm transmission service (and filed with the

          Commission).  SoCal Edison contends that requiring a separate

          service agreement for each short-term firm transaction to be

          filed with the Commission will stifle transactions in the short-

          term market.  It indicates that it suggested a simpler approach

          in Docket No. ER96-222-000 that would establish a non-transaction

          specific Service Agreement and a Completed Application that would

          contain the specific transaction information, but would not be 

          filed with the Commission, but would be made available for audit.

          389/      Commission Conclusion

               SoCal Edison misinterprets the tariff provisions regarding

          service agreements for non-firm point-to-point transmission

          service.  Tariff section 14.5 details the treatment of service

          agreements for non-firm transmission service: 

                    The Transmission Provider shall offer a
                    standard form Non-Firm Point-To-Point
                    Transmission Service Agreement (Attachment B)
                    to an Eligible Customer when it first submits
                    a Completed Application for Non-Firm Point-
                    To-Point Transmission Service pursuant to the
                    tariff. (Emphasis added)

               Moreover, in tariff section 18 (Procedures for Arranging for

          Non-Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service) requires that a

          separate service agreement be executed for each individual


               To date, the Commission has only issued a suspension order
               in this proceeding.





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001         -62-
            and RM94-7-002

          service transaction as claimed by SoCal Edison.  In the pro forma

          tariff, the Commission established a non-transaction specific (or

          "umbrella") service agreement in an attempt to streamline the

          application procedures for non-firm point-to-point transmission

          service.  Therefore, the service agreement for non-firm point-to-

          point transmission service need only be executed and filed with

          the Commission once, when the transmission customer first applies

          for non-firm point-to-point transmission service.  Subsequent

          non-firm transactions by the same customer only require the

          submission of a completed application (as provided in tariff

          sections 18.1 and 18.2) by that customer, which will be submitted

          via the transmission provider's OASIS (when the OASIS is fully

          implemented).  Accordingly, no changes are required to the

          application procedures for non-firm point-to-point service.

               However, we do find SoCal Edison's arguments persuasive that

          streamlined procedures should also be applied to applications for

          firm point-to-point transmission service with a duration of less

          than one year (short-term firm).  We agree that there is no

          compelling reason to require the submission of separate service

          agreements for every short-term firm transaction.  Accordingly,

          we will adopt an "umbrella" service agreement approach (as is

          currently used for non-firm point-to-point transactions) and

          require a service agreement of general applicability to be filed

          with the Commission when the first short-term firm transaction is

          arranged between the transmission provider and customer.  





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001         -63-
            and RM94-7-002

               In order to facilitate an umbrella service agreement

          approach for short-term firm transmission service, minor

          modifications have been made to several sections of the pro forma

          tariff 390/ as well as to Attachment A (Form of Service Agreement

          For Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service).  Notably, pages 3

          and 4 of the service agreement, containing transaction specific

          information, is now required only for long-term firm point-to-

          point transmission service.

                    7.   Other Tariff Provisions

                         a.   Minimum and Maximum Service Periods

               In the Final Rule, the Commission adopted a one-day minimum

          term for firm point-to-point service. 391/  The Commission also

          concluded that it will not specify a maximum term for either firm

          point-to-point or network transmission service.  However, the

          Commission modified the tariff to require that an application for

          transmission service specify the length of service being

          requested.

               Rehearing Requests

               CCEM states that a competitive market for hourly trades

          should be allowed to develop (transmission and ancillary

          services).  It argues that contrary to the Commission's goal of

          comparability, the Rule effectively allows only incumbent

          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001         -64-
            and RM94-7-002

          utilities to participate in hourly markets on behalf of their own

          or network loads (citing section 13.1 of the pro forma tariff).

               American Forest & Paper argues that firm and non-firm

          service should be made available on an hourly basis and that the

          Commission should assure that utilities make non-firm service

          available.

               Commission Conclusion

               It is unclear as to what hourly "trades" CCEM is referring. 

          If CCEM is referring to off-system sales, the transmission

          provider is obligated to take transmission for any off-system

          sales under point-to-point transmission service under its tariff. 

          Inasmuch as the tariff does not require the provision of hourly

          firm transmission, in order to provide itself with hourly firm

          transmission, the transmission provider would either:  (1)

          reserve firm point-to-point service on a daily basis in order to

          participate in the hourly market or (2) propose in a section 205

          filing to modify its tariff to voluntarily provide hourly firm

          point-to-point service.  Under either circumstance, comparability

          would be maintained as all point-to-point customers would have

          equal access to the hourly market.

               If CCEM is referring to purchases, hourly economy purchases

          by the transmission provider on behalf of its native load

          customers are also available on a comparable basis to network

          customers.  However, if CCEM is referring to specific purchases

          made on behalf of a particular wholesale customer, this resale





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001         -65-
            and RM94-7-002

          must be provided under point-to-point transmission service, as

          described above.

               The Commission has rejected hourly firm point-to-point

          transmission service as a mandatory service to be provided under

          the Tariff. 392/  Many entities would not oppose hourly firm

          service if afforded a lower priority, i.e., if they were

          curtailed before longer-term firm services.  However, with this

          lower priority there may be little or no difference between the

          pro forma tariff non-firm service and curtailable firm hourly

          service.  The Commission adopted the one-day minimum term for

          firm service to address concerns that customers would engage in

          "cream skimming" by taking firm service only during the hours at

          the daily peak while taking non-firm service for other hours, and

          thereby avoiding paying a fair share of the costs of the

          transmission system.  However, this does not mean that the

          Commission would not allow such services if voluntarily proposed

          by a transmission provider.

               Finally, in response to American Forest & Paper, the

          transmission provider has every incentive to make non-firm

          service available to all eligible customers in order to benefit

          native load customers, as the revenues generated by this service

          are typically used as a revenue credit to offset the costs of

          providing firm service.  In addition, parties may raise concerns 

          with the Commission in a section 206 complaint if the

          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001         -66-
            and RM94-7-002

          transmission provider offers non-firm transmission service in a

          non-comparable, i.e., unduly discriminatory fashion.

                         b.   Amount of Designated Network Resources

               In the Final Rule, the Commission indicated that it will not

          change the limitation on the amount of resources a network

          customer may designate. 393/  The Commission explained that a

          transmission provider is required to designate its resources and

          is subject to the same limitations required of any other network

          customer.

               The Commission further explained that limiting the amount of

          resources to those that the customer owns or commits to purchase

          will protect a utility from having to incur costs that are out of

          proportion to the customer's load.

               With respect to the allocation of interface capacity under

          network service, the Commission clarified that a customer is not

          limited to a load ratio percentage of available transmission

          capacity at every interface.  It explained that a customer may

          designate a single interface or any combination of interface

          capacity to serve its entire load, provided that the designation

          does not exceed its total load.

               Rehearing Requests

               A number of entities state that section 30.8 of the pro

          forma tariff should be clarified to conform to the Final Rule

          preamble.  The preamble states that a network customer should not

          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001         -67-
            and RM94-7-002

          be limited to a load ratio percentage of available transmission

          capacity at every interface, but may designate a single interface

          or any combination of interface capacity to serve its entire

          load, provided that the designation does not exceed its total

          load.  However, they point out that section 30.8 of the pro forma

          tariff provides that a network customer's use of the transmission

          provider's total interface capacity with other transmission

          systems may not exceed the network customer's load ratio share.

          394/  

               TAPS and Wisconsin Municipals ask the Commission to clarify

          the inconsistency by deleting the phrase "Ratio Share" at the end

          of the section 30.8.  TAPS argues that section 30.8 of the tariff

          conflicts with the preamble, other sections of the tariff itself

          (see section 28), and recent Commission orders (Wisconsin Public

          Service Corporation, 74 FERC  61,022 at 61,064 and FMPA v. FPL,

          67 FERC 61,167 at 61,484).  It further argues that load ratio

          restrictions on total interface usage would expand the market

          power of transmission providers.

               EEI and Southern state that under section 30.8 and the

          related preamble language, it is unclear how the concept of load

          ratio share should be applied in the context of interface

          capacity, (i.e., is the network customer entitled to a load ratio

          share of available transmission capacity or total transmission

          capacity for an interface?).  They argue that ATC is the


               E.g., NRECA, Blue Ridge, TDU Systems, Cleveland, AEC &
               SMEPA, Wisconsin Municipals, TAPS.





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001         -68-
            and RM94-7-002

          appropriate basis for calculating shares of interface capacity

          and state that the Commission should specify that network service

          entitles the user to a load ratio share of the available capacity

          of each interface.  EEI adds that if sufficient interface

          capacity is available, a request by a network customer to use

          available interface capacity to bring in resources for network

          load in excess of its load ratio share of the interface should be

          accommodated under the point-to-point tariff and treated on a

          first-come, first-served basis. 395/

               Florida Power Corp states that "[i]n order to clarify that

          network customers may obtain transmission service over the

          transmission provider's interfaces in excess of their load ratio

          shares, the Commission should clarify that additional interface

          capability may be purchased (subject to availability) as firm

          point-to-point transmission service." (Florida Power Corp at 29).

               Commission Conclusion

               We agree that the pro forma tariff should be conformed to

          the preamble language in the Final Rule so that the interface

          capacity is limited to the customer's total load, not a load

          ratio share.  This is consistent with the Commission's recent

          rehearing order in FMPA v. FPL:

                    We clarify that the phrase "that is, up to
                    its share of the load, 3%" was not intended
                    to limit FMPA's use of each interface to a
                    discrete ratio (3%).  Rather, FMPA, as well


               TAPS filed a response opposing these requests for rehearing.
               (TAPS Response).  As we explained above, we will accept the
               TAPS Response.

            and RM94-7-002

                    as Florida Power, can use each interface, if
                    capacity is available, to service its entire
                    network load.  If the interface is
                    [constrained] [sic], they will either pay
                    redispatch costs or expansion costs based on
                    their load ratio share. [396/]

                         c.   Eligibility Requirements

               In the Final Rule, the Commission found that a non-

          discriminatory open access transmission tariff must be made

          available, at a minimum, to any entity that can request

          transmission services under section 211 and to foreign entities.

          397/

               Rehearing Requests

               VT DPS and Valero state that the Final Rule does not appear

          to contemplate that marketers will buy network service or that

          one network service customer might serve a portion of the

          requirements of another network customer.  Thus, they argue that

          network load can be double counted.  To resolve this problem,

          they argue, service should be made available to suppliers rather

          than load, as provided in the NorAm NIS tariff, Section 1.5.

               Commission Conclusion

               Power marketers are specifically named in the definition of

          Eligible Customer (Section 1.11), and nothing in the Network

          Integration Transmission Service prohibits marketers from serving

          customers and designating those customers' loads (or portions

          thereof) as the marketers' Network Loads.

               In the Final Rule, the Commission stated that section 7.3 of

          the Final Rule pro forma tariff provides that in the event of a

          customer default, the transmission provider may, in accordance

          with Commission policy, file and initiate a proceeding with the

          Commission to terminate service. 399/ 

               Rehearing Requests

               El Paso asserts that the Commission does not have the

          authority to prohibit a transmission provider from terminating

          service to a customer that has failed to pay its bill until

          permission from the Commission has been obtained.  It argues that

          the Commission does not have abandonment authority under the FPA.

               Commission Conclusion

               El Paso is not correct.  Under section 205 of the FPA,

          public utilities are allowed to effectuate changes in rates,

          of service is clearly a change in service, public utilities must

               The Commission defined the term "Native Load Customers" in

          section 1.19 of the pro forma tariff as:  

                    The wholesale and retail power customers of
                    the Transmission Provider on whose behalf the

               ultimate consumers -- from losing service unjustly; to
               provide the Commission an opportunity to ensure that the
               termination is just and reasonable.  77 FERC at 61,171.

          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001         -72-
            and RM94-7-002

                    Transmission Provider, by statute, franchise,
                    regulatory requirement, or contract, has
                    undertaken an obligation to construct and
                    operate the Transmission Provider's system to
                    meet the reliable electric needs of such
                    customers.

               Rehearing Requests

               The pro forma tariff defines native load customers as "[t]he

          wholesale and retail power customers of the Transmission

          Provider. . . ."  Cooperative Power argues that the definition of

          native load customers should recognize that joint planning is a

          sufficient criterion, and that construction and operation by the

          transmission provider should not be necessary for native load

          status to be conferred.  It asserts that under joint planning,

          the loads of transmission-only customers are considered native,

          therefore the Commission should eliminate the word power from the

          definition. 402/

               NRECA and TDU Systems state that traditional wholesale

          customers that have long been on the system, have assisted in

          paying for past expansions, and will likely continue to be

          captive to a provider's monopoly transmission service, should

          have "native load equivalent" rights if they take network or

          long-term firm service.  If the transmission provider has planned

          and will plan in the future for a customer's full or partial

               this pleading as a motion for reconsideration, not as a
               request for rehearing, because it was not filed within the
          30-day statutory period for rehearing requests.  See 16 U.S.C. 

          needs, they argue that the customer should be treated as the

          equivalent of native load.  They point out that section 1.19 of

          the tariff limits native load status only to wholesale power

          customers of the transmission provider.

               VA Com argues that the definition of native load in section

          1.19 of the tariff should include existing distribution

          cooperatives and others who currently provide service to end

          users.

               Commission Conclusion

               We reject Cooperative Power's suggestion to include

          transmission-only point-to-point customers in the definition of

          native load.  We note that network customers are provided with

          rights comparable to native load customers because the

          transmission provider includes their network resources and loads

          in its long-term planning horizon.  However, a point-to-point

          transmission service customer is not similarly situated to native

          load and Network Customers.  The Network service formula rate

          requires the Network customer to pay a load-ratio share of the

          costs of the transmission provider's transmission system on an

          ongoing basis, while a point-to-point transmission service

          customer is only responsible for paying on a contract demand

          basis over the contract term.  The network customer and the

          native load of the transmission provider pay all the residual

          costs of the transmission system and face greater risks of rate

          fluctuations due to facility additions and variations in load of

          both its and other customers.  In contrast, the point-to-point





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001         -74-
            and RM94-7-002

          transmission service customer may be more transitory in nature

          electing shorter terms of service and specific forms of service

          tailored for discrete services over specific time periods that do

          not necessarily enter into the transmission provider's planning

          horizon.  To the extent a transmission customer desires similar

          rights and cost responsibilities to a native load customer, it

          can always elect to take network service.

               We further note that, in granting a right of first refusal

          to existing customers, we afforded existing transmission only

          point-to-point customers a priority to continue to use the

          transmission provider's system. 

               VA Com's proposed change to the definition of native load

          was made in conjunction with its proposed change in the

          reservation priority (highest priority for "native load",

          followed by firm contract customers and lastly, non-firm

          customers).  Because we are rejecting VA Com's proposed

          reservation priority (see Section IV.G.3.a. above), we will also

          reject its proposed conforming change to the definition of native

          load as proposed by VA Com.

               Regarding the unbundling of off-system sales, the Final Rule

          required that all bilateral economy energy coordination contracts

          executed before the effective date of Order No. 888 must be

          modified to require unbundling of any economy energy transaction





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001         -75-
            and RM94-7-002

          occurring after December 31, 1996. 403/  Concerning the treatment

          of revenues from transmission associated with off-system sales,

          the Commission stated in the Final Rule that revenue from

          non-firm services should continue to be reflected as a revenue

          credit in the derivation of firm transmission tariff rates. 404/ 

               Rehearing Requests

               Montana Power asserts that the Commission should clarify

          that off-system sales that originate from generating plants or

          power purchases outside the transmission provider's system and do

          not use the transmission provider's transmission system should

          not be automatically assessed point-to-point charges.

               Maine Public Service asks the Commission to clarify that

          revenues from off-system sales are not to be credited where the

          sales do not use the transmission provider's system (referencing

          sections 1.44 and 8.1 of the pro forma tariff).  Maine Public

          Service states that it makes sales from Maine Yankee (which is

          not located on Maine Public Service's system) to customers not on

          its system and that it should not have to credit these sales

          revenues to its transmission customers.

               Wisconsin Municipals asks the Commission to clarify that the

          provision and level of revenue credits are rate issues and that

          if parties have negotiated provisions for revenue credits, the

            and RM94-7-002

          Final Rule cannot be used to avoid obligations undertaken in a

          settlement.

               Commission Conclusion

               Utilities must take all transmission services for wholesale

          sales under new requirements contracts and new coordination

          services under the same tariff used by eligible customers.  The

          Commission provided an extension until December 31, 1996, for

          utilities to take transmission service under the same tariff for

          their economy energy transactions, certain power pooling

          arrangements, and other multi-lateral arrangements. 405/  The

          above criteria, however, only apply when a utility transmission

          system is being used to accommodate off-system sales.  Therefore,

          a utility would not be required to take point-to-point

          transmission service if its transmission system is not being used

          for the transaction.

               Maine Public Service's concern is misplaced.  Maine Public

          Service states that certain of its sales do not use its own

          transmission system and that it pays other utilities for such

          transmission service.  However, Section 8.1 only specifies the

          treatment of revenues the transmission provider receives from

          transmission service it provides itself when making third-party

          sales using point-to-point transmission service under its tariff.

          these third-party sales, then Section 8.1 does not apply to such

          transactions.

               Wisconsin Municipals' argument with respect to prior

          settlements has been previously addressed in Section IV.D.1.c.(2)

               A detailed description of the Commission's unbundling

          requirements pertaining to requirements agreements is described

          below.

               Rehearing Requests

               Blue Ridge requests that the Commission clarify the

          definitions of requirements, economy and non-economy energy

          coordination agreements.  In addition, Blue Ridge seeks

          clarification regarding which dates are to be used to distinguish

          between existing and new contracts (July 11, 1994 or July 9,

          1996).





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001         -78-
            and RM94-7-002

               Commission Conclusion

               The definitions of economy and non-economy energy

          coordination agreements are addressed in section IV.F.4.

          (Bilateral Coordination Arrangements).  With respect to Blue

          Ridge's concern regarding requirements agreements, we defined

          requirements contracts broadly in section 35.28(b)(1) of the

          Commission's regulations as "any contract or rate schedule under

          which a public utility provides any portion of a customer's

          bundled wholesale power requirements."  The definition is

          intended to encompass partial requirements service, since that

          service is intended to meet the bundled load requirements of a

          customer that is not provided from other sources such as self-

          generation or unit power purchases.  In contrast, a non-economy

          energy coordination agreement is not intended to meet, by itself,

          the entirety of a customer's bundled power requirement or the

          residual partial power requirement of a customer.  For example, a

          50 MW unit power purchase or a long-term firm power purchase

          would supply long-term firm power but a customer would likely

          need an additional partial requirements agreement to supply the

          residual amount of its load requirement.

               Regarding Blue Ridge's request for clarification of the

          dates for new and existing agreements, the Commission explicitly

          stated in Order No. 888 that any bilateral wholesale coordination

          agreements executed after July 9, 1996 would be subject to the

          functional unbundling and open access requirements set forth in





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001         -79-
            and RM94-7-002

          the Rule. 406/  In addition, the Commission required that all

          bilateral economy energy coordination contracts executed on or

          before July 9, 1996 be modified to require unbundling of any

          economy energy transaction occurring after December 31, 1996. 

          The Commission permitted all non-economy energy bilateral

          coordination agreements executed before July 9, 1996 to continue

          in effect subject to section 206 complaints.

               For the purpose of distinguishing between existing and new

          wholesale requirements contracts and for stranded investment

          recovery provisions, the Commission established July 11, 1994 as

          the applicable date. 407/  For a utility to recover stranded

          investment costs in new requirements contracts, it must include

          explicit provisions in the contract for stranded investment

          recovery.  Existing requirements contracts would not need a

          similar provision to be eligible for stranded investment

          recovery. 408/  Utilities are required to unbundle all new

          requirements contracts.  The requirement that utilities unbundle

          existing wholesale requirements contracts is for informational

          purposes and will enable existing requirements customers to

          evaluate and compare the transmission component of existing

          contracts to alternative contracts prior to the existing

          contracts' expiration dates.

          set forth in the customer's service agreement.

               Commission Conclusion

               Utilities are free to include customer-specific terms and

          conditions or terms and conditions limited to certain customers

          (e.g., a distribution charge) in a customer's service agreement

               The Commission received requests for clarification regarding

          this issue which was not specifically addressed by the Commission

          in the Final Rule. 

               Rehearing Requests

               VT DPS asserts that network customers should not have to

          bear losses twice -- the tariffs allow collection of losses over

          all network load, even that supplied by behind the meter

          generation.  It argues that losses should only be paid on power

          actually transmitted over the company's system.





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001         -81-
            and RM94-7-002

               Commission Conclusion

               The pro forma tariff neither specifies the applicable Real

          Power Loss factors (see tariff section 28.5) nor the demand

          levels to which the loss factors should be applied.  Accordingly,

          concerns regarding the loss calculation for a customer should be

          raised when the transmission provider files with the Commission a

          service agreement for a network customer.

                         k.   Modification of Non-rate Terms and Conditions

               The Commission's requirements pertaining to modification of

          non-rate terms and conditions is described below.

               Rehearing Requests

               TAPS asserts that the language of section 35.28(c)(1)(v) and

          the preamble of Order No. 888 are inconsistent.  TAPS argues that

          the Commission should require a demonstration of consistency with

          and superiority to the terms and conditions of the pro forma

          tariff and indicate that it will not allow deviations that seek

          to withdraw the minimum terms and conditions of non-

          discriminatory transmission.  According to TAPS, the Commission

          should also clarify that the Commission will not let onerous

          tariff terms creep in through the back door, i.e., through

          service agreements.  TAPS also maintains that the Commission

          should not allow transmission providers to use conformity as an

          excuse to evade commitments.

               Commission Conclusion

               Order No. 888 allows a utility the flexibility to propose,

          after the compliance tariffs go into effect, to modify non-rate

          terms and conditions of the tariff if it can "demonstrate[] that

          such terms . . . are consistent with, or superior to, those in

          the compliance tariff."  These are the same principles that are

          referenced in the regulation language (deviations allowed if the

          transmission provider can demonstrate the deviation is consistent

          with the principles of Order No. 888).  While utilities are free

          to file revised tariffs after their compliance filings, any

          filing including service agreements will be carefully reviewed by

          the Commission to assure that the revised tariffs and service

          agreements are just and reasonable and consistent with the

          principles of Order No. 888.

               With regard to TAPS' concern about transmission providers

          evading commitments, we reiterate that we will not require

          abrogation of existing contracts (and the commitments reflected

          therein) except on a case-specific basis.

               In the Final Rule, the Commission offered clarifications on

          the Final Rule pro forma tariff requirements and certain other

          accounting issues related to the Final Rule. 410/

                              (a)  Transmission Provider's Use of Its
                                   System (Charging Yourself) 

               In the Final Rule, the Commission stated that the purpose of

          functional unbundling is to separate the transmission component

          of all new transactions occurring under the Final Rule pro forma

          tariff, thereby assisting in the verification of a transmission

          provider's compliance with the comparability requirement.  With

          respect to off-system sales, the Commission stated that the

          transmission provider would book to operating revenue accounts

          those revenues received from the customer to whom it made the

          off-system sale. 411/  The Commission required that the

          transmission service component and energy component of those

          revenues be recorded in separate subaccounts of Account 447,

          Sales for Resale.

               Rehearing Requests

               APPA argues that the revenue from the transmission component

          of all off-system uses must be included in the credit if

          comparability is to be achieved.

               APPA also argues that booking revenue credits to Account 447

          for a test year reduction does not ensure timely receipt by

          customers.  It asserts that a monthly pass-through to all firm

          transmission customers is needed.

               APPA further argues that a properly functioning revenue

          credit does away with the perception of disparate treatment of

          network and point-to-point customers.  Similarly, TDU Systems

          argues that comparability requires that revenues attributable to

          transmission owners' use of their transmission systems be flowed

          through to customers' benefit immediately so that transmission

          owners and customers receive comparable price signals with regard

          to their uses of the system.

               Commission Conclusion

               The precise methodology to be used to credit revenues from

          off-system sales for the benefit of the tariff customers should

          be addressed in the compliance filing proceedings and will depend

          on the particular rate design methodology that is ultimately

          employed.  APPA's proposed monthly pass-through of revenue

          credits raises potential issues including:  (1) use of estimates

          versus actuals; (2) the appropriate time period to be utilized;

          and (3) firm versus non-firm distinctions.  Accordingly, the

          issue of determining appropriate revenue credits is properly left

          for case-by-case determinations.  However, we agree with APPA

          that revenue from the transmission component of all off-system

          uses of the transmission system (whether by the transmission

          provider or a transmission customer) must be treated on a

          comparable basis, whether through rate design or through revenue

          credits.

                              (b)  Facilities and System Impact Studies 

               In the Final Rule, the Commission explained that

          comparability mandates that to the extent a transmission provider

          charges transmission customers for the costs of performing

          specific facilities studies or system impact studies related to a

          service request, the transmission provider also must separately

          record the costs associated with specific studies undertaken on

          behalf of its own native load customers, or, for example, for

          making an off-system sale. 412/

               In the Final Rule, the Commission indicated that, at this

          time, it was not convinced that the amounts involved or the

          difficulty associated with measuring the cost of ancillary

          services warrants a departure from our present accounting

          requirements. 413/

               The Commission attached a pro forma tariff to the Final Rule

          as Appendix D.  A number of entities have sought rehearing of

          various sections of that pro forma tariff.  Their arguments and

               Commission Conclusion

               We disagree with Oklahoma G&E that there is a need to add a

               Rehearing Requests

               Cajun argues that the Commission should mandate joint

          planning in the development of Facilities Studies.  It alleges

          that a transmission provider's independent long-range plans

          frequently include longer, higher voltage facilities than are

          needed for the transmission customers' requirements.  It further

          alleges that absent mandatory joint transmission planning, the

          transmission customers will always be paying for the incremental

          capacity cost of transmission enhancements that only fit into the

          Transmission Provider's independent long-range plans.

               Commission Conclusion

               A joint planning mandate as recommended by Cajun, NRECA and

          others is beyond the scope of this proceeding.  However, the

          Commission encourages utilities to engage in joint planning with

          other utilities and customers and to allow affected customers to

          participate in facilities studies to the extent practicable. 

          Moreover, on a regional basis, the Commission encourages the

          formation of RTGs and ISOs to represent the needs of all

          participants in a region in the planning process.

          regional practices, but if it does not, the term should be

          clearly defined in each utility's tariff.

               Commission Conclusion

               The Commission recognizes that unique operating practices

          and conditions exist on a regional basis throughout the industry. 

          Accordingly, the Commission permits certain deviations to the

          non-price terms and conditions of the tariff.  In the Final Rule,

          we stated that any proposed modifications by the utility to the

          tariff to recognize regional operations and practices must be

          demonstrated to be reasonable, generally accepted in the region,

          and consistently adhered to by the transmission provider. 416/

               Commission Conclusion

               Blue Ridge's request for clarification in the definition of

          "Network Load" in Tariff Section 1.22 and "Network Resource" in

               filings made in compliance with Order No. 888.  See, e.g.,
               American Electric Power Service Corporation, et al., 78 FERC
                61,070 (1997); Allegheny Power System, Inc., et al., 77
               FERC  61,266 (1996); Atlantic City Electric Company, et

          must consist of the entirety of a generating unit.  Tariff

          sections 1.25 and 30.1 explicitly specify that a network resource

          can be a portion of a generating resource or unit.  Indeed, the

          Commission recently emphasized this point:

                    Ohio Cooperatives have disregarded the fact
                    that a designated resource can be a part of a
                    unit.  In this example, Ohio Cooperatives
                    would make two network designations for the
                    300 MW unit: a 100 MW designation for the 100
                    MW load on one system and a 200 MW
                    designation for the 200 MW on the other
                    system. [417/]

               Rehearing Requests

               TDU Systems asserts that these sections should not be read

          to require assignment of specific Network Resources to specific

          control areas.  They state that multiple control area network

          customers need to be able to dispatch their resources

          economically to serve their loads.  They argue that the

          Commission would be in error to require that a transmission

          customer's resources be segmented if they are being dispatched to

          serve network load in one of several control areas and once so

          segmented, sales from such units be considered either third-party

          sales or become interruptible as to network load in a second

          control area and thus are not deemed Network Resources.  They

          further argue that TDU systems with loads and resources in

          multiple control areas must be allowed to designate as Network

          which meet the owned or purchased requirements of section 1.25. 

               TDU Systems argues that these sections should be revised to

          include resources that are leased by a network customer on terms

          tantamount to ownership, or which, at a minimum, afford the

          network customer a first call right to that generating resource.

               Commission Conclusion

               TDU Systems' proposed revision to recognize leased resources

          appears reasonable and we revise these sections of the pro forma

          tariff, in relevant part, as follows (new text underlined,

          deleted text in brackets):

                    1.25 Network Resource:  Any designated generating

                         resource owned, [or] purchased or leased by a

                         Network Customer under the Network Integration

                    30.1 Designation of Network Resources:  Network

                         Resources shall include all generation owned, [or]

                         purchased or leased by the Network Customer

               Commission Conclusion

               Consistent with our ruling in section IV.G.6 (Umbrella

          Service Agreement) regarding umbrella type service agreements for

          short-term firm point-to-point transmission service, we will

          modify sections 1.33 and 1.34 to require that Points of Receipt

          and Points of Delivery be specified in the service agreement for

          only Long-Term (more than one year) Firm Point-to-Point

          Transmission service.

               Rehearing Requests

               Wisconsin Municipals asks the Commission to clarify that a

          utility is not prevented from including the load of interruptible

          customers in the denominator of the fraction used to perform the

          load ratio calculation.  It claims that this is important in

          Wisconsin where the transmission system is planned without regard

          to the distinction between firm and interruptible power customers

          (interruptible customers are not subject to interruption for

          transmission reasons).

               Commission Conclusion

               The treatment of interruptible loads in the planning and

          operation of the Wisconsin transmission grid present a unique,

          case-specific situation that is best addressed on a case-by-case

          basis.  As the Commission stated in the Final Rule:

                    all tariffs need not be "cookie-cutter"
                    copies of the Final Rule tariff.  Thus, under
                    our new procedure, ultimately a tariff may go
                    beyond the minimum elements in the Final Rule
                    pro forma tariff or may account for regional,

                    tariffs that go into effect 60 days after
                    publication of this Rule in the Federal
                    Register will be identical to the Final Rule
                    pro forma tariff; however, public utilities
                    then will be free to file under section 205
                    to revise the tariffs, and customers will be

          service provided on a network basis as well as on a point-to-

          point basis.

               Commission Conclusion

               The Commission used the term "Transmission Service"

          throughout the pro forma tariff to refer only to point-to-point

          service and not network service.  We also note that the term

          "transmission service" (in lower case), which is also used

          throughout the pro forma tariff, was used to refer to both point-

          to-point and network service.  Oklahoma G&E has not identified

          any problems associated with our use of these terms and therefore

          has not supported its proposed modification.

                    Section 1.49  

               Rehearing Requests

               Santa Clara and Redding state that the transmission system

          is defined as facilities owned, controlled or operated and that



               FERC Stats. & Regs. at 31,770 n.514; mimeo at 399 n. 514.





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001         -93-
            and RM94-7-002

          this could result in the same transmission facilities being the

          part of the transmission system of two entities (e.g., COTP,

          which is owned by TANC, but operated by Western Area Power

          Administration (WAPA)).  They ask the Commission to clarify that

          only one such entity should have the obligation to provide

          transmission service.

               Commission Conclusion

               This presents a fact-specific situation that is best

          addressed on a case-by-case basis.  This situation would appear

          to arise for WAPA and TANC only if either utility receives a

          request for reciprocal transmission service or if either utility

          files a voluntary tariff.  The appropriate entity to include the

          COTP facility in its transmission system for purposes of a

          transmission tariff may depend upon the circumstances of the

          transmission request.  Therefore, a resolution of this question

          is appropriately deferred until such time as reciprocal service

          using the COTP facility is requested.

                    Section 3  

               Rehearing Requests

               CCEM asks the Commission to clarify that a transmission

          customer may switch its supplier of ancillary services.

               Commission Conclusion

               The Final Rule requires that transmission customers obtain

          all necessary ancillary services for their transactions.  They

          must purchase certain of these services from the transmission

          provider, but can self supply or obtain certain services from a





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001         -94-
            and RM94-7-002

          third party.  Consistent with these requirements, a transmission

          customer may switch suppliers of ancillary services not required

          to be provided by the transmission provider if it continues to

          demonstrate that it satisfies its ancillary service obligations.

                    Section 5.1

               Rehearing Requests

               ConEd points out that this section applies to Transmission

          Service, which the tariff defines to mean point-to-point service

          only.  It requests that this section be clarified to include

          network service.

               Commission Conclusion

               The use of the term "Transmission Service" in section 5.1 of

          the pro forma tariff was an inadvertent error.  We will change

          the term "Transmission Service" used in section 5.1 to

          "transmission service" so as to include both point-to-point and

          network transmission service.

                    Section 6

               Rehearing Requests

               CCEM asks the Commission to require that the text of the

          required sworn statement by non-transmission owning entities that

          they are not assisting an Eligible Customer be included in the

          tariff.

               Commission Conclusion

               We will deny CCEM's request as unnecessary.  The Commission

          does not believe that it must mandate the precise text of the

          required sworn statement.  Rather, the entity requesting





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001         -95-
            and RM94-7-002

          transmission service properly has the burden of explaining in a

          sworn statement the circumstances of its service request,

          including on whose behalf it may be requesting service (for

          itself or for another party).  

                    Section 8  

               Rehearing Requests

               CCEM argues that, consistent with Commission policy for

          natural gas pipelines, transmission providers should be required

          to refund all "penalties" that are in excess of the costs

          incurred to balance transmitting system operations (citing

          Transco, 55 FERC  61,446 at 62,372 (1991) and TETCO, 62 FERC 

          61,015 at 61,117 (1993)).

               Commission Conclusion

               CCEM's argument is premature.  Order No. 888 did not

          establish a rate or a penalty for Energy Imbalance Service.  CCEM

          is free to raise this concern at such time as utilities file

          their proposed rates for Energy Imbalance Service.

                    Section 11  

               Rehearing Requests

               CCEM contends that an unconditional and irrevocable letter

          of credit is extremely costly to obtain and could be used as

          subterfuge for discriminatorily denying service.  CCEM argues

          that if an irrevocable letter of credit is used, a transmission

          provider should not be able to draw on it until it tenders a bill

          that has been improperly refused.  (CCEM attached a proposed

          conditional letter of credit to its rehearing request).  Several





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001         -96-
            and RM94-7-002

          entities argue that a letter of credit should not be required for

          existing customers with a satisfactory credit history and should

          only apply to new customers or those with a history of payment

          delinquency. 419/

               Commission Conclusion

               While a transmission provider may require an unconditional

          and irrevocable letter of credit, if a customer believes that the

          transmission provider unreasonably rejected an alternative

          security proposal, it may seek relief through the dispute

          resolution procedures established in Tariff Section 12. 

          Moreover, if a customer believes a transmission provider is

          attempting to use the unconditional and irrevocable letter of

          credit in an unduly discriminatory manner, it may file a

          complaint raising such concern in a section 206 filing.  

                    Section 12  

               Rehearing Requests

               According to Public Service Co of CO, the dispute resolution

          procedures:  (1) should allow a party to appeal an arbitration

          award on the basis that arbitrators have misinterpreted the

          requirements of the pro forma tariff and (2) where a utility is a

          member of an RTG, should allow the RTG dispute resolution

          procedures to be exclusive.  Otherwise, Public Service Co of CO

          argues, entities may perceive that the Commission's procedures

          are more favorable than the RTG's and decide not to join. 



               E.g., Santa Clara, Redding, TANC.





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001         -97-
            and RM94-7-002

          Moreover, it asserts that when a utility that is a member of an

          RTG has a dispute with a customer that is a non-member, the

          customer's forum should be the Commission, or the RTG's

          procedures if those procedures apply to non-members.

               Dispute Resolution Associates asks the Commission to require

          that prior to submission of disputes for arbitration or

          Commission disposition, disputants should be required to pursue a

          mediated resolution with a qualified individual.  If

          unsuccessful, it states that parties can elect arbitration or

          Commission disposition.  If successful, it states that parties

          will have avoided litigation related costs and will not have

          jeopardized their ongoing business relationship.  Dispute

          Resolution Associates also argues that representatives at all

          negotiating sessions should be authorized to enter into an

          agreement and asks that the Commission clarify that dispute

          resolution is one of the minimum requirements of the Final Rule. 

          It also asks that the Commission require that any filed separate

          retail transmission tariffs must include section 12 type dispute

          resolution procedures.

               Commission Conclusion

               Concerning the first issue raised by Public Service Co of

          CO, even if the arbitrator misinterprets the requirements of the

          pro forma tariff, the dispute resolution procedures require such

          decision (as it affects terms and conditions of service) to be

          filed with the Commission.  Section 12.2 provides:





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001         -98-
            and RM94-7-002

                    The final decision of the arbitrator must
                    also be filed with the Commission if it
                    affects jurisdictional rates, terms and
                    conditions of service or facilities.

               As to Public Service Co of CO's second concern, a utility's

          membership in an RTG with its own Dispute Resolution Procedures

          presents a fact specific situation to which a generic response is

          not appropriate.  Whether both parties to a dispute are members

          of the RTG or only one of the parties is a member may have some

          bearing on which set of Dispute Resolution Procedures should

          apply.

               Regarding Dispute Resolution Associates concerns, a utility

          is free to propose an initial process using "mediated resolution

          with a qualified individual" prior to using the Dispute

          Resolution Procedures.  However, we see no need to modify the

          tariff to introduce such a proposed requirement as the Commission

          is not aware of other parties similarly claiming excessive costs

          or the threat of "jeopardizing ongoing business relationship[s]"

          due to the present Dispute Resolution Procedures.  Finally, any

          attempts to delete the Dispute Resolution Procedures from any

          tariff on file with the Commission would require the transmission

          provider to demonstrate that its proposed modifications are

          consistent with or superior to the pro forma tariff terms and

          conditions.





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001         -99-
            and RM94-7-002

                    Section 13.2  

               Rehearing Requests

               CCEM asserts that the term "reserved service" should be

          changed to "requested service."  Utilities For Improved

          Transition and Florida Power Corp assert that the limitations on

          unconditional reservations are too stringent and that the

          Commission should modify the third sentence of section 13.2 to

          provide:  "If the Transmission System becomes oversubscribed,

          requests for longer-term service may preempt requests for

          shorter-term service up to a time period before the requested

          commencement of service that is equal to the requested term of

          service."

               Commission Conclusion

               We will deny CCEM's request to replace the term "reserved

          service" in tariff section 13.2 with "requested service."  CCEM

          has not attempted to identify any uncertainties caused by the

          current wording of this section or explain any improvements that

          its proposed change would make.

               Utilities For Improved Transition and Florida Power Corp's

          proposal to revise the deadline for when reservations for short-

          term firm transmission become unconditional is contrary to the

          Commission's intent in adopting the conditional reservation

          approach for short-term firm transmission and is rejected. 

          Specifically, for service requests greater than a single day,

          week or month, Utilities For Improved Transition and Florida

          Power Corp's proposal decreases the period of time that such





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -100-
            and RM94-7-002

          request is conditional; in other words, such request increases

          the unconditional reservation period, thus reducing the amount of 

          longer-term transactions that the transmission provider can

          accommodate.

                    Sections 13.2 and 14.2

               Rehearing Requests

               CCEM notes that short-term firm point-to-point transmission

          service customers that have already reserved service have a right 

          to match any longer-term requests for service before being

          preempted pursuant to section 13.2.  However, CCEM states that

          these tariff sections do not establish a deadline for when such

          right must be exercised.  Because the tariff established a

          conditional reservation period for short-term firm transmission

          service (during which time longer-term firm transmission requests

          can preempt shorter-term conditional reservations) CCEM suggests

          that a shorter-term firm transmission customer should be allowed

          to exercise its right to match longer-term service requests up

          until the end of the conditional reservation period.  CCEM

          requests a similar clarification for non-firm transmission

          service but does not propose specific modification.

               Commission Conclusion

               While we agree with CCEM regarding the need to establish a

          deadline for exercising the right to match longer-term service

          requests for both short-term firm and non-firm transmission

          services, we will reject CCEM's proposed deadline for short-term

          firm transmission service.  CCEM's proposed deadline would create





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -101-
            and RM94-7-002

          market inefficiency by allowing the holder of the shorter-term

          firm transmission service an excessive amount of time to exercise

          its right to match the longer-term service.  We feel that such a

          proposal could constitute a form of hoarding that would stifle

          the consummation of potential transactions and should not be

          allowed.  CCEM's proposal would work to the detriment of any and

          all potential customer(s) requesting longer short-term firm

          transmission service.  By allowing the original transmission

          customer to delay its response, the subsequent potential customer

          will be disadvantaged and may be required to make last minute

          alternative arrangements.  

               We believe that an especially quick response time is

          necessary for hourly non-firm transmission service customers to

          match longer-term service requests.  Hourly non-firm transmission

          customers must exercise their right to match longer-term service

          requests immediately upon notification by the transmission

          provider of a longer-term competing request for non-firm

          transmission service.  For non-firm transmission service other

          than hourly transactions and short-term firm transmission

          service, we believe a customer should exercise its right to match

          longer-term service requests as soon as practicable.  The prompt

          exercising of such right is particularly critical where

          scheduling deadlines for such transactions are imminent. 

          However, even for transactions with longer lead-times before

          service is to commence, we believe a response deadline of no more

          than 24 hours from being informed by the transmission provider of





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -102-
            and RM94-7-002

          a longer-term competing request for transmission service is

          appropriate.  Accordingly, the customer will be required to

          respond to the transmission provider as soon as practicable after

          notification of a longer-term request for service, but no longer

          than 24 hours from being notified or earlier if required to

          comply with the scheduling requirements for such services in

          tariff section 13.8 and 14.6.  Tariff sections 13.2 and 14.2 will

          be modified accordingly.

                    Section 13.5  

               Rehearing Requests

               Several utilities argue that section 13.5 is too broad

          because it also applies to costs that are included in rates on an

          embedded cost basis (which they claim can be evaluated when the

          transmission provider makes a rate filing). 420/  They recommend

          that the Commission modify the last sentence of the section as

          follows:

                    If redispatch costs or Network Upgrade costs
                    are to be charged to the Transmission
                    Customer on an incremental basis or costs
                    relating to Direct Assignment Facilities that
                    are to be charged to the Transmission
                    Customer, the obligation of the customer to
                    pay such costs shall be specified in the
                    Service Agreement prior to the initiation of
                    service." (Utilities For Improved Transition
                    at 74-75).

          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -103-
            and RM94-7-002

               Commission Conclusion

               The Commission's intent in tariff section 13.5 was to

          require that any proposal to assess incremental charges to a

          customer must be specified in that customer's service agreement. 

          Florida Power Corp and VEPCO correctly note that tariff section

          13.5 inadvertently requires that any redispatch, network upgrade

          or direct assignment facilities, whether assessed on an

          incremental basis or included in embedded cost rates, must be

          specified in a customer's service agreement.  To eliminate this

          unintended result, tariff section 13.5 is revised in relevant

          part as follows (new text underlined):

                    Assignment Facilities costs to be charged to
                    the Transmission Customer on an incremental
                    basis under the Tariff will be specified in
                    the Service Agreement prior to initiating
                    service.  

                    Section 13.6  

               Rehearing Requests

               CCEM asserts that the term "Good Utility Practice" should be

          deleted.  CCEM claims that the inclusion of regional practices in

          Good Utility Practice makes the phrase vague and unpredictable. 

          CCEM proposes that the Commission replace this phrase with a

          qualifier that pertains only to reliability and safety. 

          According to PA Coops, equal priority places inordinate and

          unwarranted pressure on state siting and regulatory authorities

          to approve transmission projects required to provide service that

          may primarily benefit out of state parties.  NYSEG argues that





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -104-
            and RM94-7-002

          the Commission is not authorized to require curtailment of

          bundled retail service because it does not have jurisdiction over

          the rates, terms, and conditions of such service.  It asserts

          that transactions subject to proportional curtailment should not

          include a transmitting utility's own use of its system to

          transmit its owned and purchased generation to native load

          customers as part of bundled retail service or services under

          rate schedules that are grandfathered.  For transactions subject

          to proportional curtailment, NYSEG argues that allocation of

          curtailments will be comparable only if those multiple

          transactions being curtailed are of the same type of service and

          if each of the multiple transactions is for the same duration --

          these curtailments should be made on the same basis as required

          for non-firm PTP service.  It asks the Commission to clarify that

          the curtailment requirements are not applicable to existing

          transmission contracts. 

               Commission Conclusion

               CCEM's concerns center on the inclusion of the phrase

          regional practices in the definition of Good Utility Practice in

          section 1.14 of the pro forma tariff.  These concerns are

          answered in section 1.14 above.

               PA Coops' argument that long-term firm point-to-point

          transmission customers should be curtailed before network service

          customers and native load ignores the fact that the transmission

          provider has an obligation under the pro forma tariff to expand

          or upgrade its transmission system in response to requests for





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -105-
            and RM94-7-002

          such long-term point-to-point transmission requests.  In turn,

          such long-term firm point-to-point transmission customers

          undertake an obligation to pay for any transmission facility

          additions necessary for the provision of service pursuant to the

          tariff.  Comparability requires that all long-term firm

          transmission customer be treated on a not unduly discriminatory

          basis in terms of curtailment priority.

               Regarding NYSEG's arguments, the purpose of the curtailment

          provisions of the pro forma tariff is not to "requir[e]

          curtailment of bundled retail service" as NYSEG claims.  Rather,

          the provision simply requires the transmission provider to

          curtail network and point-to-point transmission services on a

          basis comparable to the curtailment of the transmission

          provider's service to its native load.  Indeed, we have

          repeatedly indicated that we do not have jurisdiction over

          bundled retail sales. 

               NYSEG's concerns regarding curtailment provisions in

          existing contracts are addressed above in Section IV.G.3.a. (Pro-

          rata Curtailment Provisions).

                    Section 13.7 

               Rehearing Requests

               Utilities For Improved Transition and Florida Power Corp

          state that section 13.7 of the pro forma tariff makes it

          uneconomic to engage in system sales transactions on a firm basis

          because it requires the transmission provider to impose a

          separate charge for transmission from each generating station. 





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -106-
            and RM94-7-002

          They ask that the Commission clarify that if there is a sale from

          multiple generators, a reservation of transmission from each

          point of receipt will be required only in the amount of the

          expected relative contribution of each generating station to the

          energy that is sold.  If it is not so clarified, they argue that

          the Commission should make one of the following modifications: 

          (1) permit the customer to designate more than one generating

          station as a single point of receipt if it provides likely

          loadings of the units to the transmission provider; (2) provide

          that where the customer takes service from a group of generating

          stations on an economic dispatch basis, the reserved capacity is

          the sum of the reservations at the points of delivery (must also

          provide likely loadings); or (3) add a new subsection to Article

          31 that provides that a network integration transmission customer

          may also reserve service on a contract demand basis for periods

          as short as one day (but do not reduce the one-year minimum term

          for load-based network service).  

               CSW Operating Companies asserts that the Commission should

          permit sales of power from multiple points of receipt, but such

          multiple generating units should be considered a single point of

          receipt.  According to CSW Operating Companies, this provides

          maximum flexibility, lessens the need to establish secondary

          points of receipt, and is consistent with FMPA v. FPL, 74 FERC 

          61,006 at 61,014 (1996).  They ask that the Commission revise

          section 13.7(b) to provide:  "The Transmission Customer may

          purchase transmission service to make sales of capacity and





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -107-
            and RM94-7-002

          energy from multiple generating units that are on the

          Transmission Provider's Transmission System.  Such multiple

          generating units shall be considered a single Point of Receipt

          when the underlying sale is to be made on a system basis and not

          from specific generating units." (CSW Operating Companies at 10-

          11).  TAPS requests that the Commission clarify that a network

          customer may make system sales to third parties using the point-

          to-point provisions without designating each generating resource

          as a point of receipt.  Moreover, it asks that if the Commission

          intends to depart from FMPA v. FPL, that transmission providers

          be held to the same burden.

               Commission Conclusion

               Several utilities request rehearing on the tariff's

          requirement that sales of capacity and energy from multiple

          generating units must be designated as multiple points of receipt

          under point-to-point transmission service.  These parties

          generally claim that this tariff requirement makes system sales

          transactions uneconomical and is contrary to the Commission's

          determination in FMPA v. FPL, 74 FERC  61,006 at 61,014 (1996).  

               As the Commission stated in the Final Rule:

                    all tariffs need not be "cookie-cutter"
                    copies of the Final Rule tariff.  Thus, under
                    our new procedure, ultimately a tariff may go
                    beyond the minimum elements in the Final Rule
                    pro forma tariff or may account for regional,
                    local, or system-specific factors.  The
                    tariffs that go into effect 60 days after
                    publication of this Rule in the Federal
                    Register will be identical to the Final Rule
                    pro forma tariff; however, public utilities
                    then will be free to file under section 205





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -108-
            and RM94-7-002

                    to revise the tariffs, and customers will be
                    free to pursue changes under section 206.
                    [421/]

          Utilities that advocate modifying the pro forma tariff to

          accommodate system sales are free to file their specific

          proposals with the Commission in a section 205 filing. 422/  Such

          proposals are best reviewed on a case-specific basis where the

          type of system sales engaged in by the transmission provider or

          transmission customer can be identified and described in detail. 

          In order to ensure comparability, any proposed tariff

          modifications submitted in order to facilitate system sales of

          the transmission provider must also apply for sales by

          transmission customers as well.

               Rehearing Requests

               Blue Ridge argues that because units at the same geographic

          location can be connected to the system at different electrical

          locations, such as connections at different voltage levels (e.g.,

          one unit connected at 500 kV and another unit connected at 230

          kV), the Commission should replace the phrase "at the same

          generating plant" with "at the same electrical location." (Blue

          Ridge at 23-24).

          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -109-
            and RM94-7-002

               Commission Conclusion

               Blue Ridge's proposed change is unsupported.  The rationale

          supporting the need for such change and its intended result is

          unclear and unexplained and appears to be unnecessary and overly

          restrictive.  Many generating units at a single plant are

          connected to the transmission grid at multiple voltages. 

          Therefore, taking Blue Ridge's proposal to its logical end, a

          customer could face an additional charge at a single unit for

          every voltage level connection.  In contrast, the intent of

          section 13.7(b) of the pro forma tariff is to treat multiple

          units at a single plant as a single point of receipt to avoid

          charging a customer an unnecessary additional charge.

                    Section 13.8  

               Rehearing Requests

               CCEM asks the Commission to clarify that permissible

          scheduling changes extend to changes in the amount of power

          scheduled, the generation source, and delivery and receipt

          points.  AMP-Ohio asserts that if the transmission provider can

          accommodate a change, the customer should be able to change its

          schedule less than 20 minutes before the hour or during the hour,

          and during an emergency or when the customer is attempting to

          remain within the 1.5% deviation band.  It also asks the

          Commission to clarify that customers should be allowed to

          aggregate multiple points of delivery of less than a whole

          megawatt to be stated in whole megawatts (as is allowed for

          points of receipt).  Otherwise, AMP-Ohio asserts, this would





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -110-
            and RM94-7-002

          preclude small utilities from receiving service under a

          transmission provider's open access tariff.

               Commission Conclusion

               We agree with CCEM that permissible scheduling changes

          include the amount of power scheduled (up to the amount of

          capacity reservation stated in the customer's service agreement). 

          However, a proposed modification to the generation source or to

          receipt and delivery points on a firm basis under the pro forma

          tariff is not simply a scheduling change, as maintained by CCEM,

          but is a new request for service, as set forth in pro forma

          tariff section 22.2.   

               AMP-Ohio's request regarding scheduling changes ignores the

          optional language in section 13.8 of the pro forma tariff, which

          permits a reasonable time limitation (other than the stated

          twenty minute deadline) that is "generally accepted in the region

          and is consistently adhered to by the transmission provider." 

          Accordingly, the pro forma tariff may be amended by the

          transmission provider to reflect the prevailing practice in the

          region.

               AMP-Ohio's request regarding scheduling changes to allow the

          customer to stay within the deviation band of 1.5 percent may not

          be feasible depending upon the ramping rates of the particular

          generating units and may allow erratic scheduling by customers

          that could interfere with the transmission provider's ability to

          provide load following service. 





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -111-
            and RM94-7-002

               AMP-Ohio's request for clarification that customers should

          be allowed to aggregate multiple points of delivery of less than

          a whole megawatt is unnecessary.  Tariff section 17.2 (viii)

          specifically allows customers to combine their requests for

          service for either points of receipt or points of delivery in

          order to satisfy the minimum transmission capacity requirement.

                    Section 14.2  

               Rehearing Requests

               Tallahassee asks the Commission to clarify that a non-firm

          customer facing possible interruption for economic reasons will

          be allowed to match the duration and price of the surviving

          transaction and that once a non-firm transaction begins, it will

          not be preempted without whatever notice is sufficient and

          appropriate in the region, but the time period should be no

          shorter than 1-2 hours.

               Commission Conclusion

               The pro forma tariff does allow a customer to match a longer

          term reservation before being preempted.  Moreover, non-firm

          transmission transactions, by definition, are interruptible for

          economic reasons (on a non-discriminatory basis) at any time.  To

          the extent a prevailing regional practice exists regarding

          advance notice of interruption, the transmission provider may

          incorporate such a provision in its tariff.

                    Section 14.4  

               Rehearing Requests

               CCEM asks the Commission to clarify that a non-firm point-

          to-point service agreement is an Umbrella Agreement and a non-

          firm point-to-point customer should be able to schedule a

          transaction at different primary and secondary receipt points and

          schedule changes in primary points with no filing requirement.

               Commission Conclusion

               The form of service agreement for non-firm transmission

          service is a non-transaction specific umbrella service agreement

          (See Attachment B to the pro forma tariff).  Therefore, the

          service agreement does not require a specification of receipt and

          delivery points for non-firm point-to-point transmission service. 

          However, we note that changes to the receipt or delivery points

          for non-firm transmission service other than those points

          reserved by the transmission customer in its service request are

          not "schedule" changes as claimed by CCEM, but will require the

          submission of a new application for service pursuant to Tariff

          Section 18.

          changes" for non-firm transmission include changes in the amounts

          scheduled, changes in receipt and delivery points, or changes in

          primary points.

               This issue is addressed in Section 13.8 above.

               Rehearing Requests  

               The EPRI/NERC Working Group (formerly the "What and How

          Industry Working Group") identifies certain areas in the pro

          forma tariff "where the perceived scope of OASIS has grown beyond

          that which is feasible in Phase 1" of OASIS. (EPRI/NERC Working

          Group at 2).  EPRI/NERC Working Group references various

          information required in the application process under the pro

          forma tariff that is required to be submitted via OASIS to the

          transmission provider.  EPRI/NERC Working Group explains that a

          substantial amount of information required under the pro forma

          tariff "cannot be provided via the OASIS in Phase 1" (e.g.,

          service agreements, requests for (A) non-firm point-to-point

          transmission service in the next hour, (B) multiple receipt and

          delivery points, (C) addition of new network loads or resources,

          loadflow and stability data).  

               The EPRI/NERC Working Group also claims that tariff section

          17.1 creates confusion as it first requires that "[a] request for

          Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service . . . must contain a

          written Application . . ." to the transmission provider, but then

          requires "[a]ll Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service requests

          should be submitted by entering the information listed below on

          the Transmission Provider's OASIS." (Emphasis added).  The

          EPRI/NERC Working Group asserts that the above language confuses

          process of "a request for transmission service" by a customer who

          already has a service agreement.  

                    Commission Conclusion

               The Commission recognizes that implementation of the OASIS

          is being accomplished in phases.  In recognition of this fact,

          section 17.1 of the pro forma tariff provides:

                    Prior to implementation of the Transmission
                    Provider's OASIS, a Completed Application may
                    be submitted by (i) transmitting the required
                    information to the Transmission Provider by
                    telefax, or (ii) providing the information by
                    telephone over the Transmission Provider's
                    time recorded telephone line. 

          Moreover, we clarify that if Phase 1 of OASIS implementation does

          not support the submission of certain information over the OASIS,

          such information may be submitted by telephone or telefax

          (facsimile), as provided in the pro forma tariff, and promptly

          (within one hour) posted on OASIS by the Transmission Provider.

               On December 27, 1996, the Commission issued an order that
               found that

                    during Phase 1, a request for transmission
                    service made after 2:00 p.m. of the day
                    preceding the commencement of such service,
                    will be "made on the OASIS" if it is made
                    directly on the OASIS, or, if it is made by
                    facsimile or telephone and promptly (within
                    one hour) posted on the OASIS by the
                    Transmission Provider.

          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -115-
            and RM94-7-002

               Concerning the EPRI/NERC Working Group's apparent confusion

          regarding service application processes, we previously explained

          in Section IV.G.6 that the Commission is modifying the

          application process for firm point-to-point transmission

          transaction of less than one year (short-term firm transactions). 

          The Commission will permit an "umbrella service agreement"

          approach where all of a customer's short-term firm transactions

          can be arranged under a single non-transaction specific umbrella

          service agreement rather than requiring a new service agreement

          for each short-term firm transaction.  In contrast, service

          agreements for firm point-to-point transmission transactions of

          one year or more (long-term firm transactions) are transaction

          specific and require a separate service agreement for each

          transaction.

                    Section 17.1  

               Rehearing Requests

               CCEM states that the 60 days in advance to request service

          should be shortened to 6 days.  For service shorter than one

          year, it argues that the procedures should not be left to

          negotiation with a monopolist.  For service greater than one

          month but less than one year, it asserts that a request should be

          submitted 3 days in advance; for weekly service, schedules should

          be submitted by some specific hour the day before service is to

          commence; and for hourly or daily service, schedules should be

          submitted no later than 20 minutes in advance.

               Commission Conclusion





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -116-
            and RM94-7-002

               CCEM has provided no support for its proposal to shorten the

          lead time for requests for firm service from sixty days to six

          days.  Sixty days in advance of the commencement of long-term

          (greater than one year) firm service is not an unreasonable time

          period.  It provides transmission providers time to conduct

          security analyses, as well as perform system impact studies and

          facility studies that may be necessary.  Accordingly, CCEM's

          request is denied.

                    Section 17.2  

               Rehearing Requests

               CCEM argues that information concerning the location of the

          generating facility and the load ultimately served is not

          required in connection with a good faith request under the Policy

          Statement Regarding Good Faith Request for Transmission Services

          and should not be required in a Completed Application.  However,

          if it is required, CCEM argues that it should remain confidential

          and not be disclosed.  It further asks the Commission to clarify

          that a point-to-point customer can designate all receipt and

          delivery points in order to obtain umbrella-type service and can

          schedule receipt and delivery points as primary or secondary and

          can change primary points by filing another schedule.

               Commission Conclusion

               We will deny CCEM's proposed changes in part as unnecessary. 

          The locations of generating facilities and loads are needed by

          the transmission provider to allow it to analyze whether the

          requested transmission service can be accommodated over the





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -117-
            and RM94-7-002

          existing transmission system, as well as to plan upgrades and

          transmission facility additions. 424/

               Tariff section 17.2 already requires that "the transmission

          provider shall treat this [confidential] information consistent

          with the standards of conduct contained in Part 37 of the

          Commission's regulations." 

               With respect to CCEM's request to permit umbrella-type

          service, we note that we have adopted an umbrella-type service

          agreement approach for short-term firm transmission service, as

          discussed in Section IV.G.6 (Umbrella Service Agreements).

                    Section 17.3

               Rehearing Requests

               CCEM asserts that a customer determined to be creditworthy

          should not have to submit a deposit for firm point-to-point

          transmission service.  CCEM would limit this section to those

          customers found not to be creditworthy and asks the Commission to

          clarify that only the costs of system impact studies or

          facilities studies can be deducted from the deposit.



               We further note that CCEM's reference to the Commission's
               Policy Statement Regarding Good Faith Request for
               Transmission Services does not support its position.  As we
               there stated,

                    [a] good faith request for transmission
                    service should also contain a specific,
                    technical description of the requested
                    services in sufficient detail to permit the
                    transmitting utility to model the additional
                    services or its transmission system.

          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -118-
            and RM94-7-002

               Commission Conclusion

               Section 17.3 reflects a standard requirement in many

          existing tariffs and other agreements on file with this

          Commission.  CCEM provides no compelling reason to revise this

          tariff provision.  

               We also deny CCEM's request regarding deductions from the

          deposit.  We will not preclude a utility from demonstrating that

          it incurs costs other than system impact studies or facilities

          studies in processing a service application and arguing that

          these costs should be deducted from a deposit.

                    Section 17.4

               Rehearing Requests  

               CCEM argues that a deficiency determination should be made

          in, at most, one day.

               Commission Conclusion

               CCEM provides no compelling reason to revise this tariff

          provision.  CCEM's argument also ignores the fact that certain

          applications involve more complex unique transactions and

          associated arrangements which may require more time to review

          than other more standard applications.  CCEM's apparent concern

          regarding deficient applications should be mitigated by the pro

          forma tariff requirement that the transmission provider must

          attempt to remedy minor deficiencies in the application

          informally with the transmission customer.

                    Sections 17.5  

               Rehearing Requests

               CCEM asserts that a transmission provider should respond to

          a completed application for firm transmission service within 10

          minutes for hourly service, 10 minutes for daily service, 4 hours

          for weekly service, 1 day for monthly service, 2 days for service

          longer than one month but less than one year, and 5 days for

          service one year or longer.

               Commission Conclusion

               Section 17.5 requires the transmission provider to notify

          the eligible customer as soon as practicable, but no later than

          30 days after receipt of a completed application if it can

          provide the service or if a system impact study will be required. 

          We do not believe that further specificity in establishing

          deadlines for each type of service and duration of service is

          necessary.   However, we are clarifying section 17.5 to require

          that all responses be made on a non-disriminatory basis.  If CCEM

          believes the transmission provider is engaging in discriminatory

          behavior by delaying responses to service requests (or by

          responding to service requests by its wholesale merchant function

          more quickly than it responds to service requests by unaffiliated

          customers), it can file a section 206 complaint with the

          Commission.

                    Section 17.7

               Rehearing Requests  

               Several utilities ask the Commission to clarify that, if

          transmission facilities have been constructed to accommodate a

          request for transmission service, delays by the customer in

          commencing service should be prohibited or the customer should

          pay the full carrying charges on the facilities during the period

          of delay (less any revenues received). 425/  Similarly, EEI and

          Southern argue that if new facilities are constructed, but the

          customer postpones service by paying a reservation fee, fairness

          requires that the customer bear its cost responsibility for the

          new construction at the time the facilities are ready to be used.

               Commission Conclusion

               Because different factual circumstances could exist that may

          lead to alternative solutions to the problem, we will not adopt a

          generic resolution.  Rather, the Commission believes it

          appropriate to allow each utility to propose solutions in

          subsequent section 205 filings with the Commission. 

                    Section 19  

               Rehearing Requests

               VA Com asks the Commission to clarify that determining the

          necessity of a transmission facility upgrade or addition remains

          a state prerogative.  It asserts that native load customers may

          face reduced reliability, or may incur costs associated with


               E.g., Utilities For Improved Transition, Florida Power Corp,
               VEPCO.





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -121-
            and RM94-7-002

          premature additions, if calculations of ATC are incorrect.  In

          addition, it asserts that generating facilities can also be used

          to relieve regional capacity constraints -- "For example, a

          current proposal by Virginia Electric and Power Company

          ("Virginia Power") seeks the Virginia Commission's approval of a

          major new transmission line.  Virginia Power alleges that the

          line is needed since it would increase the availability of

          emergency off-system supplies and allow it to lower its capacity

          reserve requirements.  If the Virginia Commission were to approve

          the line, it is conceivable that FERC could direct Virginia Power

          to use this additional interchange capability to facilitate

          wholesale wheeling transactions.  In such an event, native load

          customers may be adversely affected since the utility would be

          forced to suffer diminished reliability or build additional

          generation or transmission facilities." (VA Com at 10-12).  CCEM

          asks the Commission to require studies for short-term firm point-

          to-point service or requests for capacity that are posted on the

          OASIS.

               Commission Conclusion

               In the Final Rule, the Commission explicitly stated that

                    public utilities may reserve existing
                    transmission capacity needed for native load
                    growth and network transmission customer load
                    growth reasonably forecasted within the
                    utility's current planning horizon.  However,
                    any capacity that a public utility reserves
                    for future growth, but is not currently
                    needed, must be posted on the OASIS and made
                    available to others through the capacity

                    reassignment requirements, until such time as
                    it is actually needed and used. [426/]

          This ability to reserve capacity to meet the reliability needs of

          native load would apply equally to transmission built in the

          future.

               VA Com requested clarification of the intended treatment by

          the Commission in the ATC calculation of a transmission line

          built in lieu of generation for purposes of lowering reserve

          requirements for native load.  If it seeks to withhold capacity

          in response to a request for service by an eligible customer, the

          transmission provider will have the burden of proof to

          demonstrate that any reserved capacity is needed for meeting

          native load and network customers' load growth or for purposes of

          meeting a reserve requirement level that is reasonable.

               CCEM's request is unnecessary because system impact studies

          and facilities studies are required pursuant to tariff section 19

          for both long-term and short-term firm point-to-point

          transmission service.

                    Sections 19.2 and 32.2  

               Rehearing Requests

               Utilities For Improved Transition and VEPCO ask the

          Commission to modify these sections to require that a system

          impact study agreement specify the estimated charge instead of

          the maximum charge so that the transmission provider may collect

          all prudently incurred study costs.

               Commission Conclusion

               Utilities For Improved Transition and VEPCO correctly note

          that the use of the phrase "maximum" in the language of tariff

          sections 19.2 and 32.2 may prevent a utility from collecting the

          full costs of conducting a system impact study despite acting in

          a prudent manner.  Accordingly, the relevant portion of these

          sections are modified as shown below to eliminate this potential

          inequity (deleted text in brackets): 

                    (i)  The System Impact Study Agreement will clearly
                         specify [the maximum charge, based on] the
                         Transmission Provider's estimate of the actual
                         cost, and time for completion of the System Impact
                         Study.  The charge shall not exceed the actual
                         cost of the study.

                    Sections 19.3 and 19.4  

               Rehearing Requests

               TAPS asserts that the 15-day periods for customers to

          execute a service agreement after completion of a system impact

          study are too short and should be lengthened to 30 days or the

          transmission provider should be allowed to provide an extension

          for cause (with public notice) while the customer is pursuing an

          agreement in good faith.

               Commission Conclusion

               TAPS' proposed changes are not necessary because the

          eligible customer is provided a sufficient response time

          considering the situation to which the eligible customer is

          responding.  Specifically, the 15-day period in section 19.3

          refers to the situation where the transmission provider has





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -124-
            and RM94-7-002

          conducted a system impact study and concluded that the requested

          service can be provided without the need to modify its

          transmission system.  TAPS provides no reason why the eligible

          customer requesting the service should not be prepared to

          immediately accept the offer to provide service at the

          transmission provider's standard rate (without the need for

          upgrades, the eligible customer would not be assessed incremental

          transmission charges).  

               Similarly, the 15-day period in section 19.4 refers to the

          time in which the eligible customer has to execute a facilities

          study agreement in which it agrees to pay the transmission

          provider for the costs of conducting a facilities study.  In

          contrast, when the facilities study is completed and the eligible

          customer is provided with a good faith estimate of any direct

          assignment facilities and/or share of any network upgrades,

          section 19.4 provides the eligible customer with 30 days to

          respond.

                    Section 22.1(d)  

               Rehearing Requests

               Utilities For Improved Transition and Florida Power Corp ask

          the Commission to modify this section to require that a request

          for modification of service on a non-firm basis be made by

          submitting a modification to the original application with an

          OASIS posting.  Otherwise, they assert, this section implies that

          such modifications would occur without using the transmission

          provider's OASIS.

               Commission Conclusion

               Utilities For Improved Transition and Florida Power Corp

          misinterpret this section of the tariff.  The Commission's

          intention is simply to clarify that the customer's request to

          modify its firm transmission service to receive service over

          secondary receipt and delivery points on a non-firm basis would

          not require a separate application for non-firm transmission

          service.  The concerns expressed with respect to posting on the

          OASIS are addressed in Order No. 889-A.

                    Section 23.1

               Rehearing Requests

               CCEM asserts that the Commission sHhould specify the filings

          necessary for assignment of service referenced in this section or

          delete the clause.  In addition, CCEM asks the Commission to

          clarify that the identical services will be provided at no

          additional cost to the assignee or the reseller.

               Commission Conclusion

               The pro forma tariff is a tariff of general applicability. 

          For administrative reasons, the listing of every conceivable

          situation in which an assignment or transfer of service from one

          entity to another may require a separate filing is not feasible. 

          For example, if the Commission lists only a single situation that

          requires a separate filing and subsequently determines another

          situation would also require a filing, all of the pro forma

          tariffs on file with the Commission would need to be revised to

          reflect the change.  





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -126-
            and RM94-7-002

               CCEM's request that the Commission clarify that reassigned

          services will be provided at no extra cost is also denied.  CCEM

          ignores the fact that nothing in the pro forma tariff prevents

          the transmission provider from seeking a change in rates pursuant

          to a section 205 filing whether such filing relates to a general

          increase in rates to all transmission customers or to additional

          costs the transmission provider asserts it incurs due to

          providing service to an assignee.  As always, the transmission

          provider bears the burden of proof of demonstrating that its

          proposal is just and reasonable. 

                    Section 23.2  

               Rehearing Requests

               CCEM asks the Commission whether an assignee can change

          primary points if there is only a partial assignment.

               Commission Conclusion

               Whether the assignment is full or partial is immaterial.  If

          an assignee wishes to change its receipt or delivery points on a

          firm basis (full or partial), the request will be treated as a

          new request for service as required under tariff sections 22.1

          and 23.1.  However, if an assignee wishes to change receipt or

          delivery points on a non-firm (full or partial) basis, such

          change can be accomplished without the need for a new service

          agreement as provided in pro forma tariff section 22.1.

                    Sections 25 and 34  

               Rehearing Requests

               VT DPS asks the Commission to revise these sections to state

          that "all firm customers should share in non-firm revenues"

          consistent with the language of the preamble. 

               Commission Conclusion

               VT DPS' request is denied.  The Commission did not intend to

          mandate the rate methodology used to reflect any cost reductions

          that may be associated with the provision of non-firm

          transmission service.  While the Commission would generally

          expect all firm customers to share in non-firm revenues, the use

          of revenue credits is not the only acceptable method of

          reflecting non-firm system usage.  The transmission provider's

          method of reflecting revenues from non-firm service should be

          addressed on a case-by case basis.  

                    Section 29.1  

               Rehearing Requests

               TAPS contends that, to avoid improper use of operating

          agreements by transmission providers, the Commission should

          either permit network operating agreements to be filed in

          unexecuted form or include a network operating agreement as part

          of the pro forma tariff.

               Commission Conclusion

               The network operating agreement is expected to be a highly

          detailed agreement between the transmission provider and network

          customer that establishes the integration of the network customer





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -128-
            and RM94-7-002

          within the transmission provider's transmission system.  Due to

          the unique characteristics of network customers' systems and the

          level of customer-specific information and arrangements required

          under a network operating agreement, it is likely that each

          network operating agreement will be different for each customer. 

          Accordingly, the Commission does not believe it appropriate to

          mandate a particular form of network operating agreement for

          inclusion in the pro forma tariff.  However, if a transmission

          provider wishes to include a generic form of network operating

          agreement in its pro forma tariff (to be modified as required and

          as mutually agreed to on a customer-specific basis), it may

          propose to do so in a section 205 filing or it may file an

          unexecuted network operating agreement in a section 205 filing.

               To the extent a customer believes a transmission provider is

          engaging in unduly discriminatory practices via the network

          operating agreement, the customer may file a section 206

          complaint with the Commission. 

                    Section 29.4  

               Rehearing Requests

               TDU Systems asserts that this section does not identify who

          should determine what facilities are "necessary to reliably

          deliver capacity and energy. . . ."  It asks the Commission to

          clarify that this is solely the responsibility of the

          transmission customer.





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -129-
            and RM94-7-002

               Commission Conclusion

               TDU Systems' argument ignores tariff section 35.1, which

          specifies:

                    [t]he Network Customer shall plan, construct,
                    operate and maintain its facilities in
                    accordance with Good Utility Practice and in
                    conformance with the Network Operating
                    Agreement. (emphasis added)

          Accordingly, the determination of what network customer

          facilities are "necessary to reliably deliver capacity and

          energy. . ." is to be agreed upon by both the transmission

          provider and network customer and specified in the network

          operating agreement.  To the extent the parties do not agree, the

          transmission provider will file an unexecuted network operating

          agreement with the Commission and we will resolve the dispute. 

                    Section 30.1  

               Rehearing Requests

               VT DPS argues that, consistent with section 30.7, section

          30.1 should not require that a network resource be available on a

          strictly non-interruptible basis.

               Commission Conclusion

               VT DPS' request is denied.  The Commission believes that a

          network customer should only be allowed to designate non-

          interruptible network resources.  To allow otherwise would

          interfere with the planning process as well as the day-to-day

          operation of the transmission system to integrate resources with

          customer's loads (e.g., the transmission provider will be unable

          to plan for what generation resource will be available to meet a





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -130-
            and RM94-7-002

          customer's load in the event its designated resource is subject

          to interruption).  Similarly, for operational purposes on a day-

          to-day basis, an interruption of a network customer's designated

          resource could cause a transmission constraint. 427/  Because

          constraints affecting reliability may lead to curtailment or

          redispatch of all network resources, other network customers

          would be affected by such interruptions on a load-ratio basis. 

          However, to the extent a network customer wishes to use an

          interruptible generation source, it can still use this generation

          source on an as-available basis to import energy to serve its

          load pursuant to pro forma tariff section 28.4.

                    Section 30.4  

               Rehearing Requests

               PA Coops ask the Commission to modify this section "to

          permit the Network Resources to be operated at outputs that

          exceed the Network Customer's designated Network Load plus losses

          when the Network Resource's output is being sold to a third party

          or the Network Resource is called upon to be operated by the

          Network Customer's power pool, ISO or control area operator." (PA

          Coops at 8-9).  Similarly, Santa Clara and Redding ask the

          Commission to modify the last sentence to state:  ". . . exceeds

          its designated Network Load, plus non-firm sales delivered under

          Part II, plus losses"  so that network resources will not remain



               While firm resources can also go off line, the probability
               of this happening is less than that for interruptible
               resources.





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -131-
            and RM94-7-002

          idle when they could otherwise generate non-firm power and energy

          for sale at competitive prices.  

               In addition, TDU Systems argues that the arbitrary limits on

          the ability of network customers to operate Network Resources

          prevents economic dispatch or the use of resources to meet load

          requirements and limits the ability to schedule the output of

          Network Resources between and among control areas, effectively

          preventing the network customer from operating an integrated

          system. 428/  TDU Systems asserts that the Commission should not

          presume that a network customer's economic dispatch will burden a

          transmission provider, but should require a transmission provider

          to demonstrate that such a burden will occur.  TAPS asks the

          Commission to clarify this section so as to bar not the operation

          of network resources in excess of network load, but rather the

          usage of network service in connection with operation of such

          resources in excess of network load.  TAPS adds that section 30.4

          is contrary to FMPA v. FPL, 74 FERC at 61,014-15.  AEC & SMEPA

          argues that the Commission should provide the necessary latitude

          for such resources to be used across multiple control areas to

          service the total load of transmission users.

               Commission Conclusion

               Preliminarily, TDU Systems and others' argument that a

          designated network resource must consist of the entirety of a

          generating unit is mistaken, as we explained in sections 1.22 and



               See also NRECA.





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -132-
            and RM94-7-002

          1.25 above.  The Commission's intent in requiring that the output

          of network resources not exceed network load plus losses is to

          prevent designated network resources from being used to make firm

          sales to third parties.  This is consistent with the pro forma

          tariff's requirement in sections 1.25 and 30.1 that:

                    Network Resources may not include resources,
                    or any portion thereof, that are committed
                    for sale to non-designated third party load
                    or otherwise cannot be called upon to meet
                    the Network Customer's Network Load on a non-
                    interruptible basis.

               Absent a requirement that network resources always be

          available to meet a customer's network loads, reliability of

          service to the network customer as well as to native load and

          other network customers could be affected, as we describe in

          detail in section 30.1 above.  If a network customer desires to

          enter into a firm sale from its designated network resources or

          use such network resources for meeting reserve requirements, it

          must eliminate the appropriate resources or portions thereof from

          its designated network resources pursuant to pro forma tariff

          section 30.

               Santa Clara, Redding and others contend that this limitation

          improperly restricts the use of network resources for non-firm

          sales.  It was not the Commission's intent to prohibit the

          network customer from engaging in non-firm sales from idle

          designated network resources.  We find that the non-firm

          operation of network resources will not affect the availability

          of such resources on a firm basis because such non-firm uses are





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -133-
            and RM94-7-002

          subject to interruption.  Accordingly, the Commission's concerns

          regarding the reliable provision of network service are

          satisfied.  

               Furthermore, as noted by Pennsylvania Coops, emergencies

          could arise in which the transmission provider may request that a

          network customer alter the operation of its network resources in

          response to a contingency, which action could result in a

          violation of the limitation in section 30.4.  Therefore, the

          Commission believes an exception to the network resources output

          limitation is also appropriate for such emergency situations. 

          Accordingly, tariff section 30.4 is revised, in relevant part,

          consistent with the above findings, as shown below (added

          language is underlined): 

                    The Network Customer shall not operate its
                    designated Network Resources located in the
                    Network Customer's or Transmission Provider's
                    Control Area such that the output of those
                    facilities exceeds its designated Network
                    Load, plus non-firm sales delivered pursuant
                    to Part II of the Tariff, plus losses.  This
                    limitation shall not apply to changes in the
                    operation of a Transmission Customer's
                    Network Resources at the request of the
                    Transmission Provider to respond to an
                    emergency or other unforeseen condition which
                    may impair or degrade the reliability of its
                    Transmission System.

               The remaining concerns expressed by TDU Systems with respect

          to the economical operation of a network customer's loads and

          resources located in multiple control areas are addressed above

          in Section IV.G.1.b. (Network and Point-to-Point Customers' Uses

          of the System (so-called "Headroom")).

                    Section 30.6  

               Rehearing Requests

               CSW Operating Companies asks the Commission to clarify that

          a customer has the obligation to replace the loss of a resource

          that is not physically interconnected with the transmission

          provider's transmission system within the time that is customary

          in the region or be subject to curtailment and suggests language

          to be included as section 33.8.  CSW Operating Companies

          indicates that it intends to include a provision addressing this

          issue in the form of a network operating agreement included in

          the individual companies' Final Rule compliance tariffs.

               Commission Conclusion

               The Commission agrees with CSW Operating Companies that the

          appropriate place to address detailed operational requirements

          such as this is the Network Operating Agreement.  If disputes

          arise, they can be addressed on a case-by-case basis.

                    Section 30.7  

               Rehearing Requests

               Wisconsin Municipals asks the Commission to clarify that,

          for purposes of comparability between network and point-to-point

          customers, a customer may not reserve capacity for firm point-to-

          point transmission service until the customer can show that it

          owns or has committed to purchase generation under an executed

          contract that it intends to use over the reserved transmission

          contract path.  Wisconsin Municipals claims that without the

          requirement to demonstrate ownership or contractual rights to the





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -135-
            and RM94-7-002

          output of a generation resource, the point-to-point customers

          will have the advantage over network customers of being able to

          reserve transmission service over facilities with limited

          available transmission capacity earlier than network customers. 

          Wisconsin Municipals also argues, in essence, that a single or a

          few point-to-point customers would be able to engage in hoarding

          of transmission capacity by reserving all available transmission

          capacity over certain transmission facilities. 

               Commission Conclusion

               The arguments presented by Wisconsin Municipals in support

          of its proposal are misplaced.  Wisconsin Municpals' assertion

          that point-to-point customers would be able to reserve

          transmission service over facilities with limited available

          transmission capacity earlier than network customers overlooks

          the fact that the Final Rule allows transmission providers to

          reserve existing transmission capacity needed for native load

          growth and network transmission customer load growth reasonably

          forecasted within the transmission provider's current planning

          horizon. 429/  Wisconsin Municipals' concerns regarding hoarding

          of transmission capacity are answered in Section IV.C.6.

          (Capacity Reassignment).  Finally, Wisconsin Municipals' argument

          that comparability requires that both network and point-to-point

          customers be required to demonstrate ownership or contractual

          rights to the output of a generation resource is not persuasive.

          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -136-
            and RM94-7-002

          Network and firm point-to-point transmission service are

          different services.  Firm point-to-point transmission service is

          available for periods as short as one day, whereas network

          service is designed to accommodate a longer term of service with

          a minimum term of service of one year.  The requirement to

          demonstrate ownership or contractual rights to generation for

          network service is necessary because the transmission provider

          must be able to serve the network load from any of the designated

          resources.  In contrast, point-to-point service is a capacity

          reservation service between specified points of receipt and

          points of delivery.  Accordingly, this network requirement does

          not need to be extended to firm point-to-point service under the

          guise of comparability.  

                    Section 31.2  

               Rehearing Requests

               TDU Systems asks the Commission to clarify that an

          application for new network load for an existing network customer

          need only address the additional network service needed to serve

          the new Network Load and does not in any way implicate the

          existing network service for which the network customer has

          already contracted.

               Commission Conclusion

               No clarification is necessary.  Tariff section 31.2

          explicitly states in relevant part:

                    A designation of new Network Load must be
                    made through a modification of service

                    Section 32.3  

               Rehearing Requests

               TDU Systems asserts that this section requires too short a

          time for customers to evaluate a system impact study.  It argues

          that, at a minimum, customers should have 60 days to evaluate a

          study and, in the event of a dispute, the application should

          remain viable until the dispute is resolved (also argues that the

          time periods set forth in sections 19.1, 19.4, 32.1, 32.3 and

          32.4 are too short).

               Commission Conclusion

               TDU Systems' proposed changes are not necessary as the pro

          forma tariff provides an eligible customer sufficient time to

          respond to a system impact study.  Specifically, the 15-day

          period in section 32.3 refers to a situation where the

          transmission provider has conducted a system impact study and

          concluded that the requested service can be provided without the

          need to modify its transmission system.  TDU Systems provides no

          reason why the eligible customer should not be prepared to

          immediately accept the offer of providing service at the

          transmission provider's standard rate (without the need for

          upgrades, the eligible customer would not be assessed incremental

          transmission charges).

               Similarly, the 15 day period in sections 19.1, 19.4, 32.1

          and 32.4 refer to the time in which the eligible customer has to





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -138-
            and RM94-7-002

          agree to execute an agreement to pay the transmission provider

          for costs of conducting studies (a system impact study in

          sections 19.1 and 32.1 and a facilities study in sections 19.4

          and 32.4).  TDU Systems provides no reason why it should not be

          prepared to accept or reject the relatively minor costs of

          further studies to determine whether its requested transmission

          service can be accommodated by the transmission provider.

               In contrast, when the facilities study is completed and the

          eligible customer is provided with the a good faith estimate of

          any direct assignment facilities and/or share of any network

          upgrades, the eligible customer is given 30 days to respond,

          which is more than a sufficient time.

                    Sections 33.2 and 34.4

               Rehearing Requests

               TAPS asserts that the Commission cannot shunt aside the need

          for ongoing revenue crediting to reduce transmission charges as a

          rate issue, while allowing monthly redispatch costs to be

          collected monthly in charges under the tariff.  It contends that

          the Commission must require revenues to be shared on an ongoing,

          load-ratio basis.

               Commission Conclusion

               As discussed above, redispatch of all Network Resources and

          the transmission provider's own resources is only to be performed

          to maintain the reliability of the transmission system, not for

          economic reasons.  As a result, the frequency of redispatch

          charges being assessed to network customers is expected to be





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -139-
            and RM94-7-002

          infrequent.  In addition, the Commission is according substantial

          flexibility to public utilities to propose appropriate pricing

          terms in their compliance tariff, which includes the treatment of

          revenue credits.  As mentioned above, there are several methods

          that utilities can use to properly reflect a benefit from non-

          firm transmission service to firm transmission customers.  We do

          not believe it appropriate to mandate a specific method, such as

          automatic monthly flow through of revenue credits, at this time. 

          However, TAPS may pursue this issue when utilities file their

          compliance rates or subsequent 205 rate filings. 

                    Section 34.3  

               Rehearing Requests

               Several utilities assert that because the monthly

          transmission system load is composed in part of the contract

          demands of all firm point-to-point transmission customers and

          under the Rule the charge for firm point-to-point service may be

          derived by dividing the transmission cost of service by the sum

          of the transmission provider's 12 monthly peak firm transmission

          loads, the transmission provider is prevented from recovering its

          entire cost of service. 430/

               Maine Public Service states that parties should be allowed

          to argue on a case-by-case basis that firm transmission revenues

          should be credited instead of including the demands in the



               E.g., Utilities For Improved Transition, Florida Power Corp,
               VEPCO (asserts that rates for firm point-to-point service
               should be developed in the same way).

          denominator (it indicates that this issue is pending in Docket

          No. ER95-836).  It asserts that the revenue credit method would

          prevent transmission providers that offered discounts from

          unjustly being penalized for that decision and is the only method

          that permits utilities to have an opportunity to recover their

          costs.  It adds that the Commission established procedures to

          keep gas pipelines whole in this same situation.

               Commission Conclusion

               While the Commission established one method of calculating

          load ratios and allocating costs in Order No. 888, 431/ 

          utilities are free to propose alternative pricing methodologies

          in a section 205 filing consistent with the Commission's

          Transmission Pricing Policy Statement. 432/  We note, however,

          such utilities will have the burden of demonstrating that these

          methods would not result in over-collections of their revenue

          requirement.

               Rehearing Requests

               TDU Systems asks the Commission to clarify, as a matter of

          comparability, that any mechanism proposed by a transmission

          provider to collect charges based on opportunity costs associated

          with redispatch must provide for the collection of other

          customers' like costs and payments to those customers.

               Commission Conclusion

               This issue is addressed in Section IV.G.1.e. (Opportunity

          Cost Pricing).

                    Schedules 7 and 8  

               Rehearing Requests

               TAPS asks the Commission to clarify that these schedules do

          not approve "heightened" charges for short-term services.

               Commission Conclusion

               The Commission did not specify transmission rates for any

          tariff services in Order No. 888.  The rates for long-term firm

          transmission, short-term firm transmission and non-firm

          transmission services are to be proposed by the transmission

          provider, as listed on Tariff schedules 7 and 8, and filed with

          the Commission.  TAPS' argument regarding "heightened" charges

          for these services is therefore premature.  TAPS is free to raise

          this concern at such time as utilities file their proposed

          transmission rates.

                    Attachment G  

               Rehearing Requests

               Santa Clara and Redding ask the Commission to modify

          Attachment G so that, where interconnection/operational standards

          are in place and working effectively, additional standards are

          not imposed simply as a result of switching to the pro forma

          tariff from its current interconnection service.





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -142-
            and RM94-7-002

               Commission Conclusion

               The pro forma tariff does not specifically require that the

          network operating agreement between the transmission provider and

          network customer must be a new agreement.  However, the network

          operating agreement is expected to be a highly detailed agreement

          between the transmission provider and network customer

          establishing the integration of the network customer within the

          transmission provider's transmission system.  Existing agreements

          between the customer and transmission provider may not provide

          all of the information required or make all of the technical

          arrangements required under the pro forma tariff (e.g.,

          redispatch and ancillary services information and arrangements.) 

          Nevertheless, to the extent the transmission customer is

          currently receiving network integration transmission service or

          similar service and its present interconnection agreement fully

          comports with the requirements of the terms and conditions of the

          tariff including the informational requirements specified in

          tariff sections 33 and 35, then the present

          interconnection/operations agreement can be substituted for a

          network operating agreement or modified appropriately.

                    9.   Miscellaneous Tariff Administrative Changes

               Due to administrative oversight, certain tariff sections

          require minor corrections or modifications.  Because of the

          administrative nature of these changes, we believe that no

          further discussion is needed.

                    multiple transactions to:

                         the Transmission Provider will
                         curtail service to Network
                         Customers and Transmission
                         Customers taking Firm Point-To-
                         Point Transmission Service on a
                         basis comparable to the curtailment
                         of service to the Transmission
                         Provider's Native Load Customers.

                    10.  Pro Forma Tariff Compliance Filings

               Absent a waiver, all public utilities must submit, no later

          than [insert date 120 days after publication of this order in the

          Federal Register], a compliance filing that reflects the tariff

          changes set forth in this order on rehearing. 433/

               A conforming pro forma tariff, containing all the revisions

          and clarifications contained in this order on rehearing, is

          attached as Appendix B.  In addition, an electronic version of

          the conforming pro forma tariff will be made available on the

          Commission's electronic bulletin board service (Commission

          Issuance Posting System (CIPS)) in redline/strikeout form in

          WordPerfect 5.1 format.


               To the extent a public utility has been granted a waiver of
               the Order No. 888 tariff filing requirements (or a non-
               public utility for reciprocity purposes), it need not submit
               a request for a separate waiver of the requirements of this
               order on rehearing. 





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -144-

               H.   Implementation

               In the Final Rule, the Commission set forth the details of

          the implementation procedures and included special implementation

          requirements for coordination arrangements (power pools, public

          utility holding companies, and bilateral coordination

          arrangements). 434/

                    The Revised Procedures

               The Commission adopted slightly different implementation

          procedures for Group 1 public utilities (tendered for filing open

          access tariffs before the date of issuance of the Rule) and for

          Group 2 public utilities (did not tender for filing open access

          tariffs before the date of issuance of the Rule). 

                    1.  Group 1 Public Utilities 

               In the Final Rule, the Commission required Group 1 public

          utilities, within 60 days following publication of the Final Rule

          in the Federal Register, to make section 206 compliance filings

          that contain the non-rate terms and conditions set forth in the

          Final Rule pro forma tariff and identify any terms and conditions

          that reflect regional practices, as discussed below. 435/  

               As to rates, the Commission noted that a transmission tariff

          rate is already in effect for all Group 1 public utilities,

          except for the few with recently-tendered applications that have

          not yet been accepted for filing.

            and RM94-7-002

               The Commission noted, however, that if a Group 1 public

          utility determined that certain rate changes are necessitated by

          the revised non-rate terms and conditions, it may file a new rate

          proposal under FPA section 205.  The Commission indicated that

          such filings must be "conforming" 436/ under the Transmission

          Pricing Policy Statement and must be made no later than 60 days

          after publication of the Final Rule in the Federal Register and 

          intervenors may raise any concerns with the filings within 15

          days after such filings. 437/  The Commission imposed a blanket

          suspension for any filings by Group 1 public utilities proposing

          rate changes necessitated by the new non-rate terms and

          conditions.  The Commission further indicated that these rates

          will go into effect, subject to refund, 60 days after publication

          of this Rule in the Federal Register (the same day on which the

          non-rate terms and conditions of the Final Rule pro forma tariff

          go into effect). 




               As described in the Transmission Pricing Policy Statement, a
               "conforming" proposal is one that meets the traditional
               revenue requirement and reflects comparability.  FERC Stats.

               Given the brief comment period on the compliance filings,
               the Commission required public utilities to serve copies of
               their compliance filings (via overnight delivery) on:  all
               participants in their current open access rate proceedings
               (if applicable); all customers that have taken wholesale
               transmission service from the utility after the date of
               issuance of the Open Access NOPR; and the state agencies
               that regulate public utilities in the states of those
               participants and customers.  By order issued July 2, 199,
               the Commission extended the comment period from 15 days to
               30 days.

            and RM94-7-002

                    2.  Group 2 Public Utilities

               In the Final Rule, the Commission indicated that Group 2

          public utilities will be treated the same as Group 1 public

          utilities with regard to non-rate terms and conditions, but will

          be treated slightly differently from Group 1 as to rates, since

          Group 2 utilities have not filed any proposed rates. 438/  The

          Commission required these utilities to either:  (i) within 60

          days following publication of the Final Rule in the Federal

          Register, make section 206 compliance filings that contain the

          non-rate terms and conditions set forth in the Final Rule pro

          forma tariff and identify any terms and conditions that reflect

          regional practices, as discussed below; and (ii) within 60 days

          following publication of the Final Rule in the Federal Register,

          make section 205 filings to propose rates for the services

          provided for in the tariff, including ancillary services; or

          (iii) make a "good faith" request for waiver.  The Commission

          added that the rates must meet the standards for conforming

          proposals in the Commission's Transmission Pricing Policy

          Statement and comply with the guidance concerning ancillary

          services set forth in this order.

               The Commission explained that intervenors may raise any

          concerns with these filings within 15 days after the filing. 439/ 


               FERC Stats. & Regs. at 31,769; mimeo at 396-97. 

               The Commission held that Group 2 public utilities must serve
               a copy of their filings (via overnight delivery) on all
               customers that have taken wholesale transmission service
          from them since March 29, 1995 (the date of issuance of the Open





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -147-
            and RM94-7-002

          The Commission imposed a blanket suspension for all such rate

          filings and indicated that they will go into effect, subject to

          refund, 60 days after the publication of this Rule in the Federal

          Register (the same day on which the terms and conditions of the

          compliance tariffs go into effect).   

                    3.   Clarification Regarding Terms and Conditions
                         Reflecting Regional Practices

               In the Final Rule, the Commission explained that it had

          built a degree of flexibility into the tariffs to accommodate

          regional and other differences. 440/  It explained that certain

          non-rate Final Rule pro forma tariff provisions specifically

          allow utilities either to follow the terms of the provision or to

          use alternatives that are reasonable, generally accepted in the

          region, and consistently adhered to by the transmission provider

          (e.g., time deadlines for scheduling changes, time deadlines for

          determining available capacity).  In addition, it explained that

          other tariff provisions require utilities to follow Good Utility

          Practice (section 1.14 of the Final Rule pro forma tariff).











          Access NOPR) and on the state agencies that regulate public
          utilities in the states where those customers are located.  By
          order issued July 2, 1996, the Commission extended the comment
          period from 15 days to 30 days.

            and RM94-7-002

                    4.   Future Filings

               In the Final Rule, the Commission indicated that once the

          compliance tariff and conforming rates go into effect, which

          would be 60 days after publication of the Rule in the Federal

          Register, a public utility (either Group 1 or Group 2) may file

          pursuant to section 205 a tariff with terms and conditions that

          differ from those set forth in this Rule, provided that, among

          other things, it demonstrates that such terms and conditions are

          consistent with, or superior to, those in the compliance tariff.

          441/  However, the Commission emphasized that the public utility

          may not seek to litigate fundamental terms and conditions set

          forth in the Final Rule.  In addition, the Commission explained

          that the public utility may file whatever rates it believes are

          appropriate, consistent with the Transmission Pricing Policy

          Statement.

                    5.   Waiver

               In the Final Rule, the Commission found that it is

          reasonable to permit certain public utilities for good cause

          shown to file, within 60 days after the Rule is published in the

          Federal Register, requests for waiver from some or all of the

          requirements of this Rule. 442/  The Commission explained that

          the filing of a request in good faith for a waiver from the

          requirement to file an open access tariff will eliminate the

          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -149-
            and RM94-7-002

          requirement that such public utility make a compliance filing

          unless thereafter ordered by the Commission to do so.  The

          Commission emphasized, however, that it will not exempt such

          public utility from providing, upon request, transmission

          services consistent with the requirements of the Final Rule.

               Rehearing Requests

               Wisconsin Municipals asserts that the Commission should

          "require utilities (if requested by their customers) to honor the

          settlements to which they have agreed and to file the pro forma

          tariff, modified to incorporate settlement provisions that exceed

          the minimum provisions of the pro forma tariff, as their

          implementational filing."  Alternatively, it asks that the

          Commission "require parties with settlements to make a Section

          205 filing one day following their implementation filing, change

          any rates, terms and conditions in the pro forma tariff as

          necessary to incorporate any superior provisions from their

          settlement tariffs into the pro forma tariff, and seek any

          waivers necessary to make the settlement tariff effective

          immediately." (Wisconsin Municipals at 7-10).

               Blue Ridge requests rehearing of the "unbalanced tariff

          implementation process that rolls over the due process rights of

          transmission customers."  It asserts that utilities should not

          have the right to file a "'Good Utility Practices,' blank check

          variance for regional practices in the compliance docket." (Blue

          Ridge at 33-35).  Blue Ridge further requests that Group 1

          utilities file compliance tariffs in the same docket as their





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -150-
            and RM94-7-002

          pending open access dockets and asks that subsequent changes be

          in a separate docket as a new general rate case.  Blue Ridge also

          states that the Commission should explicitly mention that

          customers have the right to file section 206 requests to change

          the tariffs.

               Indianapolis P&L argues that the pricing requirements are

          unjust, unreasonable, unlawful, confiscatory and an abuse of

          discretion as to Indianapolis P&L.  It asserts that its rates are

          not based on embedded, original cost, but, as a matter of Indiana

          law, its utility property is valued at the "fair value," which

          exceeds the embedded original cost of such property.  It declares

          that it is impossible for Indianapolis P&L to comply with both

          the comparability requirement and the requirement that

          transmission rates be based on original cost.  It states that the

          requirement to provide transmission service and generation-based

          ancillary services at rates based on original cost is not

          comparable to Indianapolis P&L's own use of its assets. 

          Accordingly, it argues that the Commission should allow

          Indianapolis P&L to set its initial open access rates on a fair

          value, long-run marginal cost basis.  Alternatively, it states

          that the Commission could grant Indianapolis P&L a waiver from

          the requirements of the Open Access Rule.  

               Indianapolis P&L further argues that the imposition of an

          obligation to enlarge generation to provide ancillary services is

          beyond the Commission's statutory authority.  It explains that

          Indianapolis P&L is an incidental transmission owner and a





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -151-
            and RM94-7-002

          relatively small public utility and asks that the Commission

          grant it waiver from the requirements of open access and OASIS.

          In deciding whether to grant a waiver, it asserts that the

          Commission should also consider system size and configuration,

          the amount of wholesale revenues or MWH sales, or the

          availability of competing transmission paths. 

               Union Electric argues that the final rules violate

          procedural due process and that the implementation schedule is

          unrealistically ambitious.  It argues that where the final rules

          call for changes from the NOPRs that could not be reasonably

          anticipated, they amount to deprivation of due process and rights

          to fairness in the administrative process.  Indeed, it points

          out, the Commission itself has not even completed its

          promulgation of the OASIS Final Rule.  Union Electric is

          concerned that it has not had an adequate time to comply with and

          comment on the rules.

               Commission Conclusion

               Wisconsin Municipals has misinterpreted the Commission's

          findings in Order No. 888, and thus its concerns are without

          merit.  While it is true that Order No. 888 requires all public

          utilities to make compliance filings containing the non-price

          terms and conditions set forth in the Final Rule pro forma

          tariff, 443/ Order No. 888 also states that "we are not

          abrogating existing requirements and transmission contracts

          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -152-
            and RM94-7-002

          generically. . . . " 444/  In short, the Commission is not

          requiring (or even generically allowing) the abrogation of

          existing transmission contracts, but is only requiring that

          jurisdictional transmission providers must also offer

          transmission service under the Final Rule pro forma tariff in

          addition to whatever commitments the provider will continue to

          have under its existing contracts. 445/  

               As to Wisconsin Municipals' assertions that prior individual

          settlement provisions may exceed the minimum provisions of the

          pro forma tariff, the Commission believes that such arguments

          should be addressed on a case-by-case basis. 446/

               Two additional points are pertinent.  First, we note that

          although we are not generically abrogating existing transmission

          contracts, utilities retain whatever existing rights they had to

          propose unilateral changes under section 205 of the FPA if they

          want to convert a customer to service under the tariff, and

          customers retain their section 206 right to seek reformation of

          existing transmission contracts if they are unjust, unreasonable,

          unduly discriminatory or preferential.  Second, where a utility

          has treated similarly-situated customers differently -- serving

          one under a more favorable bilateral contract and another under a

          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -153-
            and RM94-7-002

          less favorable tariff provision -- traditional undue

          discrimination remedies may be available. 

               We deny Blue Ridge's rehearing requests because the

          Commission does not intend to assume the regulatory

          responsibility of identifying in the first instance all of the

          regional practices around the country that could (and should)

          properly be reflected in the compliance tariffs.  Transmission

          customers opposed to deviations related to regional practices not

          only had the opportunity to protest the compliance filings when

          they were tendered, 447/ but these customers also have the right

          to file section 206 requests to change these tariffs at any time. 

          In addition, Blue Ridge's request that customers be given 45 days

          to respond to compliance filings instead of 15 days is moot.  In

          an order issued July 2, 1996, 448/ we took three actions to

          address this concern:  (1) we gave entities 30 days, instead of

          15 days, to respond to Order No. 888 compliance filings; (2) we

          agreed to post an electronic version of all Order No. 888

          compliance filings on the Commission's Electronic Bulletin Board;

          and (3) we required all public utilities making a compliance

          filing to also serve a copy of their filing on electronic

          diskette to any eligible customer or state regulatory agency



               We do note that most of these concerns have been addressed
               in our orders dealing with the compliance filings on non-
               rate terms and conditions.  See, e.g., Atlantic City
               Electric Company, et al., 77 FERC  61,144 (1996); Allegheny
               Power System, Inc., et al., 77 FERC  61,266 (1996).

               76 FERC  61,009 at 61,026-27 (1996) (July 2 Order). 





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -154-
            and RM94-7-002

          requesting a copy.  We believe that these actions not only

          provided all interested parties with access to the compliance

          filings more quickly, but also provided these parties sufficient

          time to analyze the information once they received it. 449/ 

          Moreover, the time periods provided for making and responding to

          Order No. 888 compliance filings have expired.

               With regard to Blue Ridge's first clarification request, we

          provide the following guidance.  Utilities that had pending open

          access filings at the time that the Final Rule was implemented

          had the non-price terms and conditions of those pending tariffs

          superseded by their Order No. 888 compliance filings.  Any

          customer concerns about the non-rate tariff terms and conditions

          in the compliance filing should be raised in the compliance

          docket, and any future customer concerns should be raised in a

          separate, future section 206 complaint filed by the customer.     

               Furthermore, we reject Indianapolis P&L's rate issue

          because, if this utility believes that it operates under special

          circumstances that require it to use "non-conforming" pricing

          methods, it is free to file such a proposal under section 205. 

          The merits of Indianapolis P&L's arguments are more appropriately

          addressed in such a section 205 proceeding.  The Commission will

          not alter its generic policy (which is the subject of this

          rulemaking) merely to address the particular needs of one party.  



               We also note that utilities were required in Order No. 888
               to explicitly identify any regional practices in their
               compliance filings.





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -155-
            and RM94-7-002

               In addition, with regard to both of Indianapolis P&L's 

          concerns, we note that pursuant to the Commission's July 2 Order,

          the Commission indicated that it would not address waiver

          requests in a generic proceeding and that parties would have to

          file such requests separately for separate docketing.  We further

          note that Indianapolis P&L filed a separate waiver request on

          July 9, 1996, which was docketed as OA96-81. 450/

               We also reject Union Electric's argument that the final

          rules violate procedural due process.  Union Electric has had

          every opportunity to raise arguments with regard to every step in

          the Commission's derivation and implementation of the final

          rules.  Moreover, with regard to Union Electric's claim that it

          was given an inadequate amount of time to comprehend and

          implement the final rules, we note that virtually every public

          utility, including Union Electric, complied with the Open Access

          Rule on a timely basis, and there have been very few complaints

          that the rules are hard to comprehend. 

               I.   Federal and State Jurisdiction:  Transmission/Local
                    Distribution

               In the Final Rule, the Commission explained that after

          reviewing the extensive analysis of the FPA, legislative history,

          and case law contained in both the initial Stranded Cost NOPR and



               By order issued September 11, 1996, the Commission denied
               Indianapolis P&L's requested waiver of all the requirements
               of Order No. 888.  On October 8, 1996, Indianapolis P&L
               sought rehearing of that order and a stay of the
               requirements of Order No. 888.  These pleadings are now
               pending before the Commission.





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -156-
            and RM94-7-002

          in the Open Access NOPR, and the comments received on that

          analysis, it reaffirmed its assertion of jurisdiction over the

          transmission component of an unbundled interstate retail wheeling

          transaction. 451/  The Commission also reaffirmed and clarified

          its determinations regarding the tests to be used to determine

          what constitute Commission-jurisdictional transmission facilities

          and what constitute state-jurisdictional local distribution 

          facilities in situations involving unbundled wholesale wheeling

          and unbundled retail wheeling. 

               The Commission also explained that where states unbundle

          retail sales, it will give deference to their determinations as

          to which facilities are transmission and which are local

          distribution, provided that the states, in making such

          determinations, apply the seven criteria discussed in the NOPR

          and reaffirmed by the Commission.  In addition, the Commission

          clarified that there is an element of local distribution service

          in any unbundled retail transaction, and further clarified other

          aspects of its jurisdictional ruling to preserve state

          jurisdiction over matters that are of local concern and will

          remain subject to state jurisdiction if retail unbundling occurs.

               The Commission reaffirmed its legal determination that if

          unbundled retail transmission in interstate commerce occurs

          voluntarily by a public utility or as a result of a state retail

          access program, this Commission has exclusive jurisdiction over



               FERC Stats. & Regs. at 31,780-85; mimeo at 427-42. 





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -157-
            and RM94-7-002

          the rates, terms, and conditions of such transmission.  The

          Commission found compelling the fact that section 201 of the FPA,

          on its face, gives the Commission jurisdiction over transmission

          in interstate commerce (by public utilities) without

          qualification.

               The Commission further explained that when a retail

          transaction is broken into two or more products that are sold

          separately, the jurisdictional lines change.  In this situation,

          the Commission emphasized that the state clearly retains

          jurisdiction over the sale of the power, but the unbundled

          transmission service involves only the provision of "transmission

          in interstate commerce" which, under the FPA, is exclusively

          within the jurisdiction of the Commission. 

               The Commission recognized that in asserting jurisdiction

          over unbundled retail transmission in interstate commerce by

          public utilities, it was in no way asserting jurisdiction to

          order retail transmission directly to an ultimate consumer.  It

          explained that its assertion of jurisdiction is that if unbundled

          retail transmission in interstate commerce by a public utility

          occurs voluntarily or as a result of a state retail wheeling

          program, the Commission has exclusive jurisdiction over the

          rates, terms, and conditions of such transmission and public

          utilities offering such transmission must comply with the FPA by

          filing proposed rate schedules under section 205.

               The Commission further clarified that nothing in its

          jurisdictional determination changes historical state franchise





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -158-
            and RM94-7-002

          areas or interferes with state laws governing retail marketing

          areas of electric utilities.  It explained that while its

          jurisdiction cannot affect whether and to whom a retail electric

          service territory (marketing area) is to be granted by the state,

          and whether such grant is exclusive or non-exclusive, neither can

          state jurisdiction affect this Commission's exclusive

          jurisdiction over transmission in interstate commerce by public

          utilities.  

               The Commission also adopted a new section 35.27(b) as

          follows:

                    Nothing in this part (i) shall be construed
                    as preempting or affecting any jurisdiction a
                    state commission or other state authority may
                    have under applicable state and federal law,
                    or (ii) limits the authority of a state
                    commission in accordance with state and
                    federal law to establish (a) competitive
                    procedures for the acquisition of electric
                    energy, including demand-side management,
                    purchased at wholesale, or (b) non-
                    discriminatory fees for the distribution of
                    such electric energy to retail consumers for
                    purposes established in accordance with state
                    law.

               With respect to the Commission's adoption of the Open Access

          NOPR's functional/technical tests for determining what facilities

          are Commission-jurisdictional facilities used for transmission in

          interstate commerce and what facilities are state-jurisdictional

          local distribution facilities, the Commission concluded that it

          could not divine a bright line for unbundled retail transmission

          by the public utility that previously provided bundled retail

          service to the end user.  The Commission added that the limited





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -159-
            and RM94-7-002

          case law, including Connecticut Light & Power Company v. FPC

          (CL&P) and Federal Power Commission v. Southern California Edison

          Company (the Colton case), 452/ supports a case-by-case

          determination. 453/  Accordingly, the Commission stated that its

          technical test, with its seven indicators, will permit reasoned

          factual determinations in individual cases.

               The Commission made two clarifications regarding local

          distribution in the context of retail wheeling.  First, it

          explained that even if its technical test for local distribution

          facilities were to identify no local distribution facilities for

          a specific transaction, states have authority over the service of

          delivering electric energy to end users.  Second, the Commission

          explained that through their jurisdiction over retail delivery

          services, states have authority not only to assess retail

          stranded costs but also to assess charges for so-called stranded

          benefits, such as low-income assistance and demand-side

          management. 

               Thus, under this interpretation of state/federal

          jurisdiction, the Commission explained, customers have no

          incentive to structure a purchase so as to avoid using



               324 U.S. 515 (1945) (CL&P); 376 U.S. 205 (1964) (Colton).

               The Commission included a detailed legal analysis in
               Appendix G to Order No. 888.  The Commission explained that
               it was particularly persuaded by the Supreme Court's
               statement that whether facilities are used in local
               distribution is a question of fact to be decided by the
               Commission as an original matter.  See CL&P, 324 U.S. at
               534-35). 





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -160-
            and RM94-7-002

          identifiable local distribution facilities in order to bypass

          state jurisdiction and thus avoid being assessed charges for

          stranded costs and benefits.

               The Commission further determined that it is appropriate to

          provide deference to state commission recommendations regarding

          certain transmission/local distribution matters that arise when

          retail wheeling occurs.  

               In instances of unbundled retail wheeling that occurs as a

          result of a state retail access program, the Commission indicated

          that it will defer to recommendations by state regulatory

          authorities concerning where to draw the jurisdictional line

          under the Commission's technical test for local distribution

          facilities, and how to allocate costs for such facilities to be

          included in rates, provided that such recommendations are

          consistent with the essential elements of the Final Rule. 454/ 

          Moreover, the Commission indicated that it will consider

          jurisdictional recommendations by states that take into account

          other technical factors that the state believes are appropriate

          in light of historical uses of particular facilities.

               As a means of facilitating jurisdictional line-drawing, the

          Commission stated that it will entertain proposals by public

          utilities, filed under section 205 of the FPA, containing



               In order to give such deference, the Commission noted its
               expectation that state regulators will specifically evaluate
               the seven indicators and any other relevant facts and make
               recommendations consistent with the essential elements of
               the Rule. 





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -161-
            and RM94-7-002

          classifications and/or cost allocations for transmission and

          local distribution facilities.  However, the Commission explained

          that, as a prerequisite to filing transmission/local distribution

          facility classifications and/or cost allocations with the

          Commission, utilities must consult with their state regulatory

          authorities.  If the utility's classifications and/or cost

          allocations are supported by the state regulatory authorities and

          are consistent with the principles established in the Final Rule,

          the Commission indicated that it will defer to such

          classifications and/or cost allocations.   

               Furthermore, the Commission stated that deference to state

          commissions with regard to rates, terms, and conditions may be

          appropriate in some circumstances.  The Commission explained that

          when unbundled retail wheeling in interstate commerce occurs, the

          transaction has two components for jurisdictional purposes -- a

          transmission component and a local distribution component.  It

          again emphasized that the Commission has jurisdiction over

          facilities used for the transmission component of the

          transaction, and the state has jurisdiction over facilities used

          for the local distribution component.  Thus, the Commission

          stated, the rates, terms and conditions of unbundled retail

          transmission by a public utility must be filed at the Commission. 

          However, the Commission added, if the unbundled retail wheeling

          occurs as part of a state retail access program, it may be





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -162-
            and RM94-7-002

          appropriate to have a separate retail transmission tariff 455/ to

          accommodate the design and special needs of such programs.  In

          such situations, the Commission indicated that it will defer to

          state requests for variations from the FERC wholesale tariff to

          meet these local concerns, so long as the separate retail tariff

          is consistent with the Commission's open access policies and

          comparability principles reflected in the tariff prescribed by

          the Final Rule.  In addition, the Commission indicated that the

          rates must be consistent with its Transmission Pricing Policy

          Statement, and the guidance set forth in Order No. 888 concerning

          ancillary services. 456/

               The Commission also expressed concern, just as it did with

          buy-sell arrangements in the gas industry, that buy-sell

          arrangements can be used by parties to obfuscate the true

          transactions taking place and thereby allow parties to circumvent

          Commission regulation of transmission in interstate commerce. 

          Thus, the Commission reaffirmed its conclusion that it has

          jurisdiction over the interstate transmission component of

          transactions in which an end user arranges for the purchase of

          generation from a third-party.  Moreover, the Commission



               The Commission noted that such a tariff could be different
               from the tariff that applies to wholesale customers, but
               that such tariff would still be filed with the Commission
               under FPA section 205.

               In applying the principles of the Final Rule to retail
               transmission tariffs, the Commission emphasized that it
               clearly cannot order retail wheeling directly to an ultimate
               consumer.  (citing FPA section 212(h)).





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -163-
            and RM94-7-002

          indicated that it will address these transactions on a case-by-

          case basis.

               Rehearing Requests

                    Oppose Commission Assertion of Jurisdiction Over
                    Unbundled Retail Transmission 

               Several state commissions indicate that, recognizing that

          the case law is not dispositive concerning the question of

          unbundled retail transmission services (either because the cases

          do not involve the transmission of power to retail customers or

          "fence off" local distribution from federal regulation), at least

          one court (Wisconsin-Michigan Power Company v. FPC, 197 F.2d 472

          (7th Cir. 1952), cert. denied, 345 U.S. 934 (1953)) explicitly

          applied the wholesale/retail distinction to distinguish

          transmission and local distribution services. 457/  Thus, they

          argue, the Commission should apply the wholesale versus retail

          analysis to the question of unbundled retail transmission.  IL

          Com asserts that retail transmission by a public utility directly

          to an end user has always (even before the FPA was enacted) been

          subject to regulation by the states.  It contends that no change

          in law has occurred which justifies the Commission's claim of

          expanded jurisdiction.  Moreover, it disagrees with the

          Commission's conclusion that the unbundled delivery by the

          previous public utility generation supplier directly to an end

          user is in interstate commerce.  It argues that the FPA was never

          intended to disturb the jurisdiction of state regulators that


               E.g., NARUC, WI Com, WY Com.





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -164-
            and RM94-7-002

          existed prior to its passage and that retail transmission of

          electric energy by a public utility to an end user was under

          state jurisdiction before the Attleboro decision and has remained

          under state jurisdiction in the over sixty years following

          Attleboro.  Even after unbundling, according to IL Com,

          transmission to a retail customer still involves a retail sale of

          transmission.

               NARUC and VA Com assert that the legislative history

          provides little support for the Commission's conclusion that the

          act of unbundling generation from delivery serves to shift

          jurisdiction from a state commission to the Commission.  If

          anything, they contend, the jurisdictional structure of the FPA

          is predicated on the distinction between retail and wholesale

          transactions, not bundled and unbundled services.  They assert

          that the Commission should conclude that the rates, terms and

          conditions of service for delivery of power by a utility to an

          end-use customer are subject to the jurisdiction of the state

          commission regulating the utility, regardless of the identity of

          the party generating or reselling the power or the facilities

          used to transport the power.  

               NARUC asserts that the Commission did not address a point

          raised in NARUC's reply comments as to how the removal of

          generation serves to unbundle the retail delivery function into

          separate transmission and distribution services.  It maintains

          that the Commission simply assumes that a resulting transmission





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -165-
            and RM94-7-002

          transaction is created when power is sold to a retail consumer by

          someone other than the utility delivering the power. 458/  

               MI & NH Coms ask the Commission to vacate those portions of

          the Rule that find that the Commission has jurisdiction over the

          transmission component of an unbundled retail sale in a local

          retail wheeling transaction.  They assert that the Commission

          should confine its activity to wholesale transactions or those

          interstate transactions that do not implicate matters of local

          concern.  They argue that the dual federal/state regulatory

          scheme establishes that Congress' intent is that state regulation

          of retail wheeling is not preempted by federal law as established

          in FPA section 201.  They oppose unnecessary federal intrusion

          into local matters under a one-size-fits-all approach and assert

          that the retail wheeling initiatives in New Hampshire and

          Michigan are tailored to the unique utility environment in each

          state.

               Central Illinois Light argues that unbundling of retail

          electric service does not change the states' longstanding

          jurisdiction over retail electric service and local distribution,

          even when that service involves the use of transmission in

          interstate commerce.  It asserts that 201(b)(1) ("transmission of



               See also IA Com (use of a utility's transmission system to
               serve its own retail customers is a bundled part of the
               retail sale transaction, which supports a simpler
               jurisdictional test holding that a movement of power by the
               last utility in any chain of delivery to a retail customer
               is a distribution transaction). 





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -166-
            and RM94-7-002

          electric energy in interstate commerce") cannot be read in a

          vacuum.

               MN DPS & MN Com and OH Com assert that the Commission should

          have no role in the regulation of retail services, be they

          bundled or unbundled.  They argue that, in refusing to grant the

          Commission authority over retail wheeling, Congress left

          jurisdiction over retail electric service to the states.  They

          conclude that the Final Rule contains insufficient legal and/or

          policy justification for the Commission's assertion of

          jurisdiction over unbundled retail transmission services.

               MN DPS & MN Com assert:  "FERC bases its usurpation of state

          authority over retail transmission rates on its claim that

          balkanization would occur without the assertion of FERC

          authority.  Therefore, the parties are entitled to rehearing so

          that this essential issue can be further analyzed." (MN DPS & MN

          Com at 1-3).

               FL Com argues that the Commission has not justified why the

          act of unbundling prices expands the Commission's jurisdiction

          into retail marketing areas.  It argues that Section 212(g) of

          the FPA has the effect of prohibiting the Commission from

          usurping existing state jurisdiction over retail transmission

          service, whether bundled or unbundled.  According to FL Com,

          FERC's jurisdiction over transmission terminates at the

          territorial boundary of each electric utility in Florida.  It

          wheeling out and wheeling through jurisdiction for the

          Commission.

               IN Com opposes federalization of retail wheeling

          transactions within a state's boundaries as contrary to the FPA's

          legislative history and case law.

               NJ BPU asserts that by claiming jurisdiction over unbundled

          retail transmission, the Commission is creating a disincentive

          for states to implement retail access because, by ordering retail

          access, the states may be relinquishing their jurisdiction over

          unbundled retail transmission terms and conditions --

          jurisdiction that they would maintain under a bundled scenario.

          459/  PA Com argues that the Commission does not have the

          authority to order retail wheeling and that the jurisdictional

          formula is challengeable on engineering and legal grounds.  It

          concludes that the Commission does not have jurisdiction over

          unbundled interstate retail transmission service.  PA Com notes

          that the 1996 House and Senate hearings have raised the question

          whether the Commission has the statutory authority to restructure

          the electric industry.  PA Com questions the Commission's

          definition of the "traditional tasks of state and federal

          regulators" on the basis of section 201(b) of the FPA, the

          Supremacy Clause, and the Tenth Amendment of the U.S.

          Constitution.

                    Support Broader Assertion of Jurisdiction by the
                    Commission Over Retail Wheeling

               NY Utilities declare that the Commission has jurisdiction

          over retail wheeling from the source to the load, but does not

          have jurisdiction over transmission in bundled retail service. 

          They assert that the Commission's reliance on state

          jurisdictional local distribution as a predicate to abstain from

          allowing retail wheeling stranded cost recovery is without

          foundation.  They further assert that a unique element that sets

          local distribution apart from transmission is not the size of the

          facility or the length of travel, but that transportation is

          bundled with a retail sale.  According to NY Utilities, the plain

          meaning of the FPA shows that local distribution is bundled

          retail service.  They claim that the legislative history, to the

          extent necessary, and court cases support FERC jurisdiction over

          all aspects of retail wheeling, but makes clear that the

          Commission cannot regulate bundled retail service.  They add that

          the NGA also demonstrates that local distribution means bundled

          retail service.

               Commission Conclusion

               In concluding that this Commission has exclusive

          jurisdiction over the rates, terms and conditions of unbundled

          retail transmission by public utilities in interstate commerce,

          the Commission in Order No. 888 thoroughly examined the statutory

          language of the FPA and its legislative history, and relevant FPA

          and NGA case law.  While the state commissions on rehearing would





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -169-
            and RM94-7-002

          like us to draw a bright line that gives them, to varying

          degrees, jurisdiction over retail interstate transmission by

          public utilities, no party on rehearing has raised any

          legislative history or case law that was not previously

          considered and that would support the proposition that states

          have jurisdiction over any unbundled transmission in interstate

          commerce.  As explained below, we reaffirm our jurisdictional

          interpretation on rehearing and believe that it is supported by

          the recent decision in United Distribution Companies v. FERC.

          460/

               Many of the rehearing arguments focus on the fact that

          states historically (even prior to the FPA) regulated retail

          transmission insofar as it was a component of bundled electric

          service to an end user, and they argue that by asserting

          jurisdiction over unbundled retail transmission, the Commission

          is somehow "taking away" jurisdiction the states previously had. 

          The flaw in these arguments is their inherent assumption that

          jurisdiction over transmission service turns upon the question of

          whether the transmission service is being provided for

          "wholesale" or "retail" power sales.  That is not the case.  The

          question of jurisdiction rather turns upon the extent of the

          Commission's exclusive jurisdiction over transmission in

          interstate commerce under the FPA.  The fact that states

          historically regulated most retail transmission service as a part


               88 F.3d 1105, 1152-53 (1996) (United Distribution
               Companies).





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -170-
            and RM94-7-002

          of a bundled retail power sale is not the result of a legal

          requirement; it is the practical result of the way electricity

          has historically been bought and sold.  However, the shape of

          power sales transactions is rapidly changing.  Rather than

          claiming "new" jurisdiction, the Commission is applying the same

          statutory framework to a business environment in which, as

          discussed below, retail sales and transmission service are

          provided in separate transactions.

               In the past, retails ales occurred almost exclusively on a

          bundled basis (i.e., the same entity provided a delivered product

          called electric energy and transmission was part and parcel of

          that product).  The FPA clearly reserves the right to regulate

          retail sales of electric energy to the states.  As we explained

          in the Final Rule, however, in today's markets, and increasingly

          in the future as more states adopt retail wheeling programs,

          retail transactions are being broken into products that are being

          sold separately:  transmission and generation.  Moreover, these

          products are being sold increasingly by two or more different

          entities.  For example, a transaction may involve transmission

          service from one or more transmission providers who move power

          from a distant generation supplier, over the interstate

          transmission grid, to an end user.  Because these types of

          products and transactions were not prevalent in the past, the

          jurisdictional issue before us did not arise and, contrary to IL

          Com's argument, the Commission cannot be viewed as "disturbing"

          the jurisdiction of state regulators prior to and after the

          Attleboro case. 461/

               As we also explained in the Final Rule, the legislative

          history of the FPA and the relevant case law similarly reflect

          the historical market structure in which electricity and

          transmission generally were bought on a bundled basis. 462/ 

          Today's unbundled world simply was not contemplated and the cases

          do not resolve dispositively this jurisdictional issue.  The case

          law focuses primarily on the bright line between wholesale sales

          and retail sales of energy, and transmission in interstate as

          opposed to intrastate commerce.  It does not address unbundled

          retail interstate transmission. 463/  We therefore have

          interpreted the case law in light of changed circumstances and



               Public Utilities Commission v. Attleboro Steam & Electric
               Co., 273 U.S. 83 (1927).

               The case law is addressed extensively in Appendix G to the
               Final Rule and will not be repeated here.

               On rehearing, several parties argue that at least one court
               case, Wisconsin-Michigan Power Co. v. FPC, 197 F.2d 472 (7th
               Cir. 1952), cert. denied, 345 U.S. 934 (1953) explicitly
               applied the wholesale/retail distinction to distinguish
               transmission and local distribution services.  The
               Commission discussed this case in detail in Appendix G to
               the Final Rule, FERC Stats. & Regs. at 31,974-75; mimeo at
               22-25.  As we stated there, the court's interpretation of
               the legislative history of the FPA was at odds with both the
               plain words of the statute as well as the language of the
               House Report on the FPA (H.R. Rep. No. 1318 at 27).  It also
               did not mention the Senate Report on the FPA, which clearly
               recognized jurisdiction over all interstate transmission
               lines, whether or not a sale of energy is carried by those
               lines (S. Rep. No. 621 at 48).  We therefore reject
               arguments that this single case is in any way dispositive of
               the issue before us.





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -172-
            and RM94-7-002

          have relied in the first instance on the plain wording of the

          statute.  We find compelling that section 201 of the FPA, on its

          face, gives the Commission jurisdiction over transmission in

          interstate commerce without qualification; unlike our

          jurisdiction over sales of electric energy, which section 201

          specifically limits to sales at wholesale, the statute does not

          limit our transmission jurisdiction over public utilities to

          wholesale transmission.

               Since the time Order No. 888 issued, the D.C. Circuit has

          addressed a similar issue in interpreting section 1(b) of the

          NGA, the provision that parallels section 201(b) of the FPA. 

          Under section 1(b), the Commission's jurisdiction does not apply

          "to the local distribution of natural gas or to the facilities

          used for such distribution."  Similarly, under section 201(b) of

          the FPA, the Commission shall not have jurisdiction, except as

          specifically provided, "over facilities used for the generation

          of electric energy or over facilities used in local distribution.

          . ."  In responding to arguments regarding the scope of state

          authority over "local distribution" of natural gas, the court

          distinguished between bundled and unbundled sales:

                    States have been -- and are still --
                    permitted to regulate LDCs' bundled sales of
                    natural gas to end-users because those
                    transactions include transportation over
                    local mains and the retail sales of gas.  In
                    contrast, states have never regulated the
                    terms and conditions of interstate pipeline
                    transportation.  When the gas sales element
                    is severed -- i.e., unbundled -- from the
                    transactions, FERC retains jurisdiction over
                    the interstate transportation component." 





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -173-

                    [United Distribution Companies, 88 F.3d at
                    1153 (footnote omitted) (emphasis in
                    original).]

          The court's reasoning is also applicable to and supports our

          jurisdictional determination in Order No. 888.

               Several state commissions point to section 212(h) of the FPA

          and argue that Congress, in refusing to grant the Commission

          authority to order retail wheeling, left all jurisdiction over

          retail transmission to the states.  We disagree.  What Congress

          did in section 212(h) was to prohibit us from ordering

          transmission directly to an ultimate consumer.  We readily

          recognize and respect this prohibition.  However, the ability to

          order retail wheeling is a separate issue from whether we have

          jurisdiction over the rates, terms and conditions of retail

          wheeling in interstate commerce that is ordered by a state or

          that is provided voluntarily.  Congress, in enacting section

          212(h), did nothing to modify our jurisdiction under sections

          201, 205 and 206 over the rates, terms and conditions of

          interstate transmission by public utilities.

               Similarly, we reject FL Com's arguments that section 212(g)

          of the FPA prohibits the Commission from asserting any

          jurisdiction over unbundled retail transmission.  Section 212(g)

          prohibits the Commission from issuing an order that is

          inconsistent with any state law that governs retail marketing

          areas of electric utilities.  As we stated in the Final Rule,

          while our jurisdiction cannot affect whether and to whom a retail

          electric service territory (marketing area) is to be granted by





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -174-
            and RM94-7-002

          the state, and whether such grant is exclusive or non-exclusive,

          neither can state jurisdiction affect this Commission's exclusive

          jurisdiction over the rates, terms and conditions of transmission

          in interstate commerce by public utilities.  We also reject

          arguments by the FL Com that this Commission's jurisdiction over

          transmission terminates at the territorial boundary of each

          electric utility in Florida.  This argument is flatly contrary to

          the longstanding interpretation of the FPA by the United States

          Supreme Court. 464/

                    Commission's Seven Factor Test

               IL Com argues that the Commission should withdraw its

          technical test.  It contends that retail wheeling jurisdiction

          should follow function and that the function served by public

          utility facilities in providing retail service does not change

          upon the unbundling of service to retail customers.  According to

          IL Com, Commission jurisdiction would extend to the service of

          delivering electric energy by a public utility to wholesale

          customers, regardless of the nature and extent of the public

          utility's facilities used to make that delivery.  Similarly, it

          asserts, state jurisdiction would extend to the service of

          delivering electric energy by a public utility directly to retail

          customers, regardless of the nature and extent of the public

          utility's facilities used to make that delivery.


               See FPC v. Southern California Edison Co., 376 U.S. 205
               (1964) (Colton case).  IN Com makes a similar argument and
               opposes "federalization" of retail wheeling within a state's
               boundaries.  We reject this argument on the same basis.





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -175-
            and RM94-7-002

               NARUC argues that the seven-factor test does not result in

          the bright line discussed in FPC v. Southern California Edison

          Company, 376 U.S. 205 (1964).  The facility-by-facility

          categorization of utility systems on a company-specific basis, it

          asserts, is hardly consistent with the Court's decision to make

          case-by-case analysis unnecessary.

               OH Com asserts that the seven factors provide no useful

          insight into the nature of local distribution service.  It adds

          that reliance upon technical tests to determine local

          distribution lacks legal foundation.  It further contends that

          the jurisdictional bright line established by Congress focuses

          upon the nature of the transaction, not the functional or

          technical characteristics of a particular wire, in determining

          whose jurisdictional authority attaches to a particular

          transaction and facilities.  It concludes that the Commission

          should adopt the Ohio-proposed retail marketing area "wheeling

          in" jurisdictional approach.

               PA Com contends that the Commission's seven indicia are not

          acceptable measures of local distribution and challenges each

          factor.

               NH & MI Coms declare that the criteria for distinguishing

          transmission facilities from local distribution facilities should

          not be limited to the seven given in the Rule, but should allow

          consideration of any other relevant criteria for separating local

          concerns from matters legitimately federal in nature.





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -176-
            and RM94-7-002

               NJ BPU argues that the engineering-driven definition does

          not resolve many of the hazy areas.  To the extent that the seven

          factors do not reflect or cannot be reconciled with the

          particular circumstances, it contends that the states may be

          hamstrung in their ability to make reasoned decisions that

          comport with Order No. 888. 465/

               Similarly, NY Com argues that five of the seven factors (1,

          2, 4, 6,and 7) are not accurate when applied to large

          metropolitan areas and remote rural areas.  It asserts that local

          distribution facilities are not necessarily close to retail

          customers and the assumption that local distribution facilities

          are primarily radial in character fails to account for network

          systems.  It adds that reconsignment or transportation of power

          to different markets can and does occur at the local distribution

          level.  It further adds that the presence of meters is not a

          discerning characteristic of where interstate transmission ends

          and local distribution begins; meters are frequently not part of

          the transmission/local distribution interface.  Nor, according to

          NY Com, are local distribution systems necessarily of reduced

          voltage.  Instead of the 7 criteria, NY Com argues that the

          Commission should adopt a functional measure of local

          distribution based on factors 3 and 5 (interstate transmission


               See also WI Com (criteria do not appropriately reflect the
               mixed nature of many facilities in systems that are closely

               electric system in Wisconsin would supplant state
               jurisdiction over a large number of facilities whose primary
               functions are local reliability and retail service).

               Commission Conclusion

               Several parties on rehearing do not like the seven-factor

          technical test for local distribution facilities that was set

          forth in Order No. 888.  That test takes into account both

          technical and functional characteristics of the transaction

          involved.  The parties on rehearing propose instead a variety of

          bright line tests.  For example, IL Com wants state jurisdiction

          to extend to the "service" of delivering electric energy to

          retail customers, which it would define to give it jurisdiction

          regardless of the nature and extent of the facilities used to

          make the delivery.  OH Com proposes that the Commission adopt a

          retail marketing area "wheeling in" jurisdictional approach which

          would give it jurisdiction over facilities within territorial

          boundaries.

               In response, we do not interpret the FPA to permit us in

          effect to rewrite the statute to give states jurisdiction over

          interstate transmission services.  Moreover, we reject arguments

          of OH Com that our seven-factor test lacks legal foundation, and

          arguments of NARUC that we are somehow bound to develop a bright

          line test.  While Congress established a jurisdictional bright





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -178-
            and RM94-7-002

          line between wholesale and retail sales of energy, there is no

          such bright line that we can divine with regard to transmission

          and local distribution facilities.  The Supreme Court, in both

          Colton and CL&P, 466/ has instructed us that whether facilities

          are used in local distribution is a question of fact to be

          decided by the Commission as an original matter.  The seven

          factors will permit us to undertake this fact-specific

          determination.

               We acknowledge the concerns raised by several state

          commissions that the seven-factor test does not, as NJ BPU puts

          it, resolve many of the hazy areas, and that there may be other

          factors that should be taken into account in particular

          situations.  The seven-factor test is intended to provide

          sufficient flexibility to take into account unique local

          characteristics and historical usage of facilities used to serve

          retail customers.  We specifically stated in the Final Rule that

          we will consider jurisdictional recommendations by states that

          take into account other technical factors that states believe are

          appropriate in light of historical uses of particular facilities. 

          Moreover, we will defer to facility classifications and/or cost

          allocations that are supported by state regulatory authorities. 

          For example, in the ongoing California electric utility

          restructuring proceeding, the Commission deferred to the State

          PUC's recommendations regarding the split between state-

                    Oppose transmission of public utility purchases for
                    sale at retail

               IL Com objects to the transmission unbundling requirement if

          it is intended to require public utilities to take transmission

          services under their own FERC tariffs for purchases of power

          intended for distribution by the public utility to retail

          customers.  According to IL Com, a distinction must be made

          between the public utility's use of its transmission system in

          cases in which the public utility purchases wholesale power for

          sale for resale, and cases in which the public utility purchases

          wholesale power to serve native load retail customers.  It argues

          that the Commission cannot legally regulate, or place conditions

          on, the manner in which a utility uses its transmission system to

          make sales of electric energy at retail.  It contends that the

          Commission must exempt public utility power purchases for sale at

          retail from the unbundling requirement.  It recommends that the

          Commission insert the words "for sale for resale" after the word

          "purchases" in section 35.28(c)(2) and after the word "purchase"

          in section 35.28(c)(2)(i).

               Commission Conclusion

               The Commission rejects arguments of IL Com that if unbundled

          retail wheeling occurs either voluntarily or as a result of a



               Pacific Gas and Electric Company, et al., 77 FERC  61,325

          state retail program, we cannot require the utility to take

          service under its own transmission tariff for sales to retail

          customers.  This requirement is a term and condition of unbundled

          retail interstate transmission service and, as explained above,

          therefore is within our exclusive jurisdiction.  Additionally,

          this should not in any way infringe on state retail programs or

          service to retail customers.  Rather, it ensures that non-

          discriminatory transmission services are provided to all

          potential retail power competitors.

               Further, as stated previously in Section IV.C.1.b

          (Transmission Providers Taking Service Under Their Tariff), we

          clarify that a transmission provider does not have to "take

          service" under its own tariff for the transmission of power that

          is purchased on behalf of bundled retail customers.

                    Oppose buy-sell transaction analysis

               PA Com asserts that there is a potential for jurisdictional

          conflict with respect to buy-sell transactions that is a direct

          consequence of the technical-functional test (which PA Com

          challenges).

               IL Com argues that states have exclusive authority to

          regulate buy-sell arrangements as bundled retail sales.  It

          further argues that the Commission cannot make a bundled retail

          sale into an unbundled retail sale simply by characterizing it as

          the functional equivalent of an unbundled retail sale; by re-

          characterizing them the Commission is effectively ordering the

          unbundling of buy-sell arrangements.  It asserts that buy-sell





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -181-
            and RM94-7-002

          arrangements on the electric side are not an end run around clear

          federal jurisdiction and that the Commission should withdraw its

          assertion of jurisdiction over the retail transmission component

          of unbundled retail sales.

               VT DPS contends that the Commission's rationale is flawed: 

          "FERC's analysis rests on the same very shaky ground as its

          similar claim of jurisdiction over buy-sell arrangements by local

          gas distribution companies."  According to VT DPS, all retail

          transactions are subject to state jurisdiction and asks the

          Commission to clarify that the Commission defines buy-sell as it

          did in the NOPR, but also acknowledge that it has no jurisdiction

          over such arrangements.

               IN Com asserts that in the absence of any record of abusive

          and undermining actions by states under the guise of buy-sell

          arrangements, there is not even a remedial justification to touch

          buy-sell transactions.  It contends that a difference between the

          FPA and the NGA warrants different treatment -- the FPA exempts

          from FERC jurisdiction local distribution and transmission of

          electric energy in intrastate commerce.  By redefining interstate

          transmission, IN Com claims that the Commission proposes to do

          away with the meaning history has accorded to a variety of

          transactions previously considered wholly intrastate in nature. 

          According to IN Com, states should be allowed to experiment with

          and allow different forms of buy-sell transactions as part of the

          evolving marketplace.

               Commission Conclusion

               Four parties (PA Com, IL Com, VT DPS and IN Com) have raised

          concerns regarding the Commission's determination that it has

          jurisdiction over the interstate transmission component of

          transactions in which an end user arranges for the purchase of

          generation from a third party.  The Commission reiterates that we

          will have to address these situations on a case-by-case basis. 

          We disagree with IL Com that States have exclusive authority to

          regulate the interstate transmission component of buy-sell

          transactions.  Similarly, we deny the VT DPS request that we

          acknowledge no jurisdiction over such arrangements.  The fact

          remains that these arrangements could be used by parties to

          obfuscate the true transactions taking place and thereby allow

          parties to circumvent Commission regulation of transmission in

          interstate commerce.  We reserve our authorities to ensure that

          public utilities and their customers are not able to circumvent

          non-discriminatory transmission in interstate commerce.  In

          response to VT DPS' contention that the Commission's analysis

          here rests on the same shaky ground as its similar claim of

          jurisdiction over buy-sell arrangements by local gas distribution

          companies, we note that the D.C. Circuit recently affirmed the

          Commission's assertion of jurisdiction over buy/sell arrangements

          under the Natural Gas Act. 468/

               Rehearing Requests

               IL Com states that it is far from clear what FERC

          contemplates by the "service" of delivery of electric energy by a

          delivering utility in the retail wheeling transaction.  It is

          equally unclear to IL Com whether the "service" to which Order

          No. 888 refers is a public utility activity over which state

          regulators would have jurisdiction.  IL Com argues that it is the

          Illinois legislature, not FERC, that determines whether IL Com

          can regulate something called "delivery service." 469/  

               MO/KS Coms ask the Commission to clarify the meaning of the

          statement that even when the test for local distribution

          facilities identifies no local distribution facilities, the

          Commission believes that states have authority over the service

          of delivering electric energy to end users.  According to MO/KS

          Coms:

                    The authority to shop at retail and to sell
                    at retail do not exist in the FPA.  If the
                    Commission's goal is to recognize the States'
                    authority to establish conditions on retail
                    competition, it need only acknowledge the
                    State jurisdiction to establish the
                    opportunity to shop and sell at retail.  If
                    this is what the Commission is seeking to
                    accomplish by its discussion of 'delivery

               be served and a generation owner's right to produce power. 
               AK Com asserts that the state can then attach conditions to

               Coalition for Economic Competition asserts that the

          Commission failed to consider that the sale of electric energy

          may take place outside of the state into which the energy is

          transmitted, and that the local regulatory commission may have no

          jurisdiction over either the sale or the transmission of the

          energy.

               Commission Conclusion

               Several parties ask us to clarify our conclusion that even

          when the seven-factor test for local distribution facilities does

          not identify local distribution facilities, we believe states

          have authority over the "service" of delivering electric energy

          to end users.  We clarify that states have the authority to

          determine the retail marketing areas of electric utilities within

          their jurisdictions, and the end user services that those

          utilities must provide, but we did not in Order No. 888 intend to

          opine on the extent of authority given by state legislatures to

          their state commissions.  Rather, our statement regarding state

          authority over the "service" of delivering electric energy is

          intended to recognize the historical and local nature of

          delivering power to end users and the states' legitimate concerns

          and responsibilities in regulating local matters.

                         Support broader deference

               NARUC and IL Com argue that the Commission should not simply

          defer to state recommendations concerning the application of the

          seven-factor test or the recovery of stranded costs, but should

          conclusively rely on the findings by state commissions.

               NY Com argues that the Commission should not limit deference

          to instances in which states order retail wheeling, but should

          defer to all state commission recommendations regarding the

          definition of local distribution facilities.

               FL Com asserts that the Rule fails to say where deference

          will be given.  It argues that the Rule should state that when a

          state commission has held a proceeding on matters related to the

          requirements of the Rule, the Commission shall give deference to

          the state commission decisions.  Moreover, it asserts that the

          Commission should codify the deference standard:  "When a state

          commission has held a proceeding on matters related to the

          requirements of this rule, the Commission shall give deference to

          the state commission decisions."  (FL Com at 7-9).

               The commitment to defer to a state regulatory commission or

          agency, argues NE Public Power District, should be clarified with

          respect to utilities located in Nebraska, which has no such

          commission or agency.  NE Public Power District assumes that

          deference will be accorded to decisions of NE Public Power

          clarify.

               PA Com asks the Commission to clarify what a state

          regulatory agency must demonstrate to secure deference and to

          define the term "consult."  PA Com states that, in discussing the

          seven indicia, the Commission states that it will "consider"

          jurisdictional recommendations by states, which PA Com asserts is

          much different from deference.  It also asserts that the

          Commission must clarify what it will do if a utility's

          classifications and/or cost allocations are not supported by

          state regulatory authorities.  

                         Oppose deference to state authorities

               TANC argues that the Commission erred in deferring to state

          regulatory authorities in drawing jurisdictional lines for local

          distribution facility classifications and/or cost allocations. 

          According to TANC, the Commission unlawfully and unnecessarily

          abdicated its jurisdiction under the FPA (citing New England

          Power Co. v. New Hampshire, 455 U.S. 331, and Nantahala Power and

          Light Co. v. Thornburg, 476 U.S. 953).  With respect to ISOs, it

               Commission Conclusion

               In response to NARUC and IL Com's arguments that this

          conclusively rely on the findings of state commissions, we

          believe this is inconsistent with the case law which states that

          local distribution it is a matter of fact for the Commission to

          determine as an original matter. 471/  Additionally, we have an

          independent obligation to ensure that we are fulfilling our

          responsibilities under the FPA to regulate facilities that are

          used in interstate commerce.  We cannot delegate our

          jurisdiction.  However, we intend to provide broad deference to

          states in determining what facilities are Commission-

          jurisdictional transmission facilities and what facilities are

          state-jurisdictional local distribution facilities, so long as

          our comparability principles are not compromised and we are able

          to fulfill our responsibilities under the statute.

               We reject FL Com's suggestion that we codify the deference

          standard.  This is neither necessary nor appropriate.  In

          response to NE Public Power District's request that we clarify to

          whom we would give deference in Nebraska, we clarify that because

          Nebraska does not have an electric regulatory commission or

          agency, there is no appropriate regulatory entity to whom our

          deference standard would apply; accordingly, we will address the

          transmission/local distribution issue for Nebraska without giving

          deference to any particular entity.  In response to PA Com's

          request that we clarify what we will do if a utility's

          classifications and/or cost allocation proposals are not

          determination based on the factual record before us in a

          particular case, taking into account the views of the state

          regulatory authority.

               TANC has argued that we have unlawfully abdicated our

          jurisdiction by deferring to state recommendations.  TANC

          confuses delegation of jurisdiction, which we cannot do, with

          willingness to defer to states based on their application of

          criteria that we have provided.  Even in the cases in which the

          Commission defers to states' views, we will still independently

          evaluate all material issues and proceed only where substantial

          evidence supports the states' views.  The Commission clearly can

          entertain requests for deference in these circumstances.

               J.   Stranded Costs

               As indicated in our prior discussion in Section IV.A.5,

          there are two major overlapping transition issues that arise as a

          result of this rulemaking:  stranded cost recovery and how to

          deal with contracts entered into under the prior regulatory

          regime.  We here address stranded cost recovery and, as in the

          prior discussion, we believe it is important to explain the

          general context in which our stranded cost determinations have

          been made before addressing the various rehearing requests on

          this issue.

               In Order No. 888, the Commission removed the single largest

          barrier to the development of competitive wholesale power markets

          by requiring non-discriminatory open access transmission as a





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -189-
            and RM94-7-002

          remedy for undue discrimination.  This action carries with it the

          regulatory public interest responsibility to address the

          difficult transition issues that arise in moving from a monopoly,

          cost-based electric utility industry to an industry that is

          driven by competition among wholesale power suppliers and

          increasing reliance on market-based generation rates.  The most

          critical transition issue that arises as a result of the

          Commission's actions in this rulemaking is how to deal with the

          uneconomic sunk costs that utilities prudently incurred under an

          industry regime that rested on a regulatory framework and a set

          of expectations that are being fundamentally altered.

               The Commission determined in Order No. 888 that it must

          address stranded costs, and that it must do so at an early stage

          -- particularly in light of the lessons learned from our

          experience with similar issues in the natural gas area.  We noted

          that when we did a similar restructuring in the gas industry, the

          D.C. Circuit invalidated the Commission's efforts precisely

          because the Commission had failed to deal with the stranded cost

          problem in a satisfactory manner. 472/  We explained that, based

          on the lesson of AGD, the Commission cannot change the rules of

          the game without providing a mechanism for recovery of the costs

          caused by such regulatory-mandated change.

               Since the time Order No. 888 issued, we have been provided

          with additional guidance from the court in the natural gas area,


               Associated Gas Distributors v. FERC, 824 F.2d 981 (D.C. Cir.
               1987), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 1006 (1988) (AGD).





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -190-
            and RM94-7-002

          which has further helped to inform our decisions here.  In its

          decision on review of Order No. 636, 473/ the D.C. Circuit upheld

          the Commission's decision to allow the recovery of gas supply

          realignment costs.  In so doing, the court, while questioning a

          specific feature of the stranded cost recovery mechanism employed

          in Order No. 636, has nevertheless again reaffirmed the basic

          principle that stranded cost recovery is an appropriate component

          of a regulatory policy aimed at accomplishing a fair and

          reasonable transition to competitive markets.  The question as to

          the Commission's ability to allow the recovery of stranded costs

          has been laid to rest.

               The task before the Commission in this rulemaking is thus to

          determine how best to meet its responsibility to address the

          costs of the transition to a competitive industry, particularly

          insofar as those costs are stranded, or in effect rendered

          unrecoverable, as a result of the transmission access required by

          us under the FPA. 474/  As the rehearing arguments demonstrate,

          there is no consensus on how the Commission should address the

          stranded cost issue.  In fact, petitioners are at polar extremes

          as to what the Commission should do regarding stranded costs. 

          Some argue that the Commission has gone too far in permitting

          utilities to seek recovery of stranded costs, whether such costs


               United Distribution Companies v. FERC, 88 F.3d 1105 (1996)
               (United Distribution Companies).

               Such access may be the open access required under this Rule
               or case-by-case transmission access ordered pursuant to FPA
               section 211.





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -191-
            and RM94-7-002

          are associated with wholesale requirements contracts, with

          retail-turned-wholesale customers, or with retail customers that

          obtain retail wheeling. 475/  Others argue that the Commission

          has not gone far enough and that it must broaden the scope of

          stranded cost recovery permitted under the Rule.  Indeed, some

          would have us be the guarantor for recovery of all uneconomic

          costs that might be stranded in the move to more competitive

          markets, no matter how tenuous the nexus to this Rule, and

          irrespective of state-Federal jurisdictional complexities.  Some

          support the Commission's decision to recover stranded costs

          directly from the departing customers.  Others would prefer that

          the Commission require utilities to absorb a portion of their

          stranded costs or that the Commission spread the burden of

          stranded costs among all of the utility's customers.  Some object

          that the Commission's approach to stranded costs in the electric

          industry is different from that adopted in the gas industry. 

          Some entities support the Commission's revenues lost approach for


               We note that the regulations implementing this Rule use
               "wholesale stranded cost" and "retail stranded cost" as
               shorthand terms to refer to the different situations in
               which a utility may experience stranded costs.  However, as
               the definitions of those terms make clear, it is not the
               nature of the costs (wholesale vs. retail) that is
               controlling for purposes of stranded cost recovery under
               this Rule.  Rather, the controlling factors are the status
               of the customer (wholesale transmission services customer
               vs. retail transmission services customer) with whom the
               costs are associated, and whether the transmission tariffs
               used by the customer to escape its former power supplier
               (thus causing the stranding of costs to occur) were required
               by this Commission or by a state commission.  As a result,
               "retail stranded costs" refers to stranded costs associated
               with retail wheeling customers.  





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -192-
            and RM94-7-002

          measuring a departing customer's stranded cost obligation. 

          Others propose different methods for computing stranded costs.

               Given the plethora of positions that entities have raised

          both initially and on rehearing concerning stranded costs, the

          Commission has taken a careful, measured approach with regard to

          stranded cost recovery.  The Commission has balanced a number of

          important interests in order to achieve what it believes will be

          a fair and orderly transition to competitive markets.  These

          interests include the financial stability of the electric utility

          industry, upholding the regulatory bargain under which utilities

          made major capital investments, and not shifting costs to

          customers that had no responsibility for causing those costs to

          be incurred.  The Commission also has adopted an approach that,

          for purposes of stranded cost recovery from wholesale

          transmission customers, relies on the nexus between stranded

          costs and the use of transmission tariffs required by this

          Commission and, for purposes of stranded cost recovery from

          retail customers, recognizes state commission jurisdiction but

          fills potential regulatory gaps that could arise in the

          transition to new market structures.

               The balancing of interests and considerations described

          above is reflected in the following central components of the

          Rule's stranded cost provisions, which are reaffirmed herein.

          476/  First, the Commission has determined that the most


               We reaffirm below our basic determinations, but make certain
                                                             (continued...)





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -193-
            and RM94-7-002

          reasonable, legally supportable approach is one that permits

          utilities to seek recovery of wholesale stranded costs under this

          Rule (whether the stranded costs are associated with a departing

          wholesale requirements customer or with a retail-turned-wholesale

          customer) only in those cases in which there is a direct nexus

          between the availability and use of Commission-required

          transmission access 477/ and the stranding of costs.  In order

          for the utility to be eligible to seek recovery of stranded costs

          from a departing customer, the customer must have obtained access

          to a new generation supplier through the use of the former

          supplying utility's Commission-required transmission tariff

          (i.e., its open access tariff or a tariff ordered pursuant to FPA

          section 211), not through the use of another utility's

          transmission system.

               Other cost recovery issues are more appropriately addressed

          outside the context of this Rule.  For example, the Rule is not

          intended to apply to costs associated with the normal risks of

          competition, such as self-generation, cogeneration, or loss of

          load, that do not arise from the new, accelerated availability of



          (...continued)
          clarifications on limited issues and grant rehearing on the
          municipal annexation issue.

               As we explain below, by "Commission-required transmission
               access" we mean the open access transmission required under
               this Rule or required pursuant to a section 211 order, as
               well as transmission provided prior to Order No. 888 (and
               not pursuant to a section 211 order) where such transmission
               was provided on a case-by-case basis to comply with the
               Commission's comparability requirement.  See note 484 infra.





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -194-
            and RM94-7-002

          Commission-required transmission access.  If a customer leaves

          its utility supplier by exercising options that could have been

          undertaken prior to mandatory transmission under Order No. 888 or

          the Energy Policy Act, or that do not rely on access to the

          former seller's transmission, there is no direct nexus to

          Commission-required transmission access and thus no opportunity

          for stranded cost recovery under the Rule.  

               Second, the Commission has limited the opportunity to seek

          stranded cost recovery under the Rule primarily to two discrete

          situations:  (1) costs associated with customers under wholesale

          requirements contracts executed on or before July 11, 1994

          (referred to in the Rule as "existing wholesale requirements

          contracts") that do not contain an exit fee or other explicit

          stranded cost provision; and (2) costs associated with retail-

          turned-wholesale customers.  With regard to the existing

          wholesale requirements contracts, the Commission also has made a

          finding that it is in the public interest to permit amendments to

          add stranded cost provisions to these contracts, even if they

          contain Mobile-Sierra clauses, if case-by-case evidentiary

          burdens are met.  We do not interpret the Mobile-Sierra public

          interest standard as practically insurmountable in extraordinary

          situations such as this one where historic statutory and

          regulatory changes have converged to fundamentally change the

          obligations of utilities and the markets in which they and their

          customers will operate.  





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -195-
            and RM94-7-002

               Third, Order No. 888 does not guarantee that a utility will

          be allowed to recover stranded costs.  Rather, it provides an

          opportunity for such recovery.  To be eligible to recover

          stranded costs from a departing customer in a particular case,

          the utility must demonstrate that it incurred costs to provide

          service to the customer based on a reasonable expectation of

          continuing service to that customer beyond the contract term.

          478/  In the case of stranded costs associated with wholesale

          requirements contracts customers, if the contract contains a

          notice of termination provision, that provision is strong

          evidence that the parties were aware that at some point in the

          future the customer might seek to find another supplier. 

          Therefore, there is a rebuttable presumption of no reasonable

          expectation, and therefore no opportunity for stranded cost

          recovery unless the utility can overcome the presumption.

               The Commission has concluded that direct assignment of

          stranded costs to the departing customer (through either an exit

          fee or a surcharge on transmission) is the appropriate method for

          recovery of stranded costs under the Rule.  In reaching this

          conclusion, the Commission carefully weighed the arguments

          supporting direct assignment of stranded costs against those

          supporting a more broad-based approach, such as spreading

          stranded costs to all transmission users of a utility's system,


               We have made a minor revision to the regulatory text,
               section 35.26(c)(2), to conform the language of that section
               with sections 35.26(b)(1) and (5).  A conforming revision
               has been made to section 35.26(d)(2)(i).





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -196-
            and RM94-7-002

          and also took into account the fact that we applied a different

          approach in the natural gas area.  The central considerations

          that support a direct assignment approach in the electric

          industry are that the approach follows the traditional regulatory

          concept of cost causation, it avoids shifting costs to customers

          that had no responsibility for causing them to be incurred or for

          causing them to be stranded, and it is still possible to apply

          such an approach at this stage of the industry's evolution.

               There is no question that, without the stranded cost

          recovery mechanism, some customers would be far more likely to

          switch to lower-cost suppliers and enjoy sooner the benefits of a

          competitive power market.  But, as detailed in Order No. 888,

          such an approach may result in higher costs for other customers. 

          We thus have had to balance the potential for earlier benefits

          for some customers against other public interest considerations,

          most particularly the need to provide a fair mechanism by which

          utilities can recover the costs of past investments under

          traditional regulatory concepts of prudently incurred costs and

          cost causation.  The result is not to deny competitive

          advantages, but only to delay their full realization for some

          customers so that all customers ultimately will benefit.

               While Order No. 888's cost causation approach is different

          from the Order No. 636 cost spreading approach that was affirmed

          in the United Distribution Companies case, we believe it is the

          preferable approach given the early stage of the electric

          utility's competitive transition.  We do not read the court's





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -197-
            and RM94-7-002

          opinion as precluding the Commission from adopting a direct

          assignment approach in Order No. 888, particularly where, as

          here, the Commission has fully explained and justified the

          reasons for following traditional cost causation principles.  In

          addition, although the United Distribution Companies court

          remanded for further consideration (in light of Order No. 636's

          cost spreading approach) the decision not to require any pipeline

          absorption of gas supply realignment costs, the Commission has

          fully explained how its decision in Order No. 888 not to require

          any utility absorption of stranded costs is consistent with its

          decision to follow traditional cost causation principles.  With

          respect to the fundamental conclusion that utilities should be

          permitted an opportunity to recover their prudently incurred

          costs, Order No. 888 is fully consistent with Order No. 636. 

          Although the Commission in Order No. 888 chose a direct

          assignment method (rather than the cost-spreading approach in

          Order No. 636) for purposes of allocating stranded cost

          responsibility among customers, the approach used by the

          Commission in Order No. 888 is not governed by decisions in Order

          No. 636, but in either event the Commission must demonstrate that

          its choice of methods is based on reasoned decision-making.

               In considering the stranded cost issues that may arise in

          the transition to competitive markets, the Commission also has

          taken cognizance of significant changes involving retail

          customers and the stranded cost issues that arise as retail

          customers convert to wholesale customer status (e.g., through





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -198-
            and RM94-7-002

          municipalizations) in order to obtain the open access afforded by

          Order No. 888, or as they obtain retail wheeling required by

          state commissions.  These situations involve new and complex

          jurisdictional issues and represent the bulk of potential

          stranded costs facing the industry.  We believe it is important

          to clarify the Commission's decisions as to when it will

          entertain requests for stranded cost recovery in these

          situations, and our reasons for doing so.

               The Commission's determination that it, rather than the

          states, should be the primary forum for addressing stranded costs

          associated with a retail-turned-wholesale customer 479/ is

          limited to those cases in which there is a direct nexus between

          the availability and use of Commission-required transmission

          access and the stranding of costs.  We believe we have both the

          authority and the obligation to provide an opportunity for


               In Order No. 888 and here, we sometimes use the shorthand
               expression "retail-turned-wholesale" customer.  By this we
               do not mean that a retail customer who is an ultimate
               consumer ceases to be an ultimate consumer, or that this
               customer begins to purchase electric energy for resale. 
               Rather, in a "retail-turned-wholesale customer" situation,
               such as the creation of a municipal utility system, a newly-
               created entity becomes a wholesale power purchaser on behalf
               of retail customers who were formerly bundled customers of
               the historical local utility power supplier.  The new
               municipal utility is the conduit by which retail customers,
               if they cannot obtain direct retail access, can reach power
               suppliers other than their historical local utility power
               supplier.  Although the retail customers remain bundled
               retail customers, in that they become the bundled customers
               of the new entity, we call this a "retail-turned-wholesale
               customer" situation because the new entity in effect "stands
               in the shoes" of the retail customers for purposes of
               obtaining wholesale transmission access and new power
               supply.





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -199-
            and RM94-7-002

          stranded cost recovery in these situations because the bundled

          retail customer would not be able to obtain access to the new

          supplier but for the Commission's order requiring transmission. 

          The creation of a new wholesale entity to purchase power on

          behalf of retail customers would not, by itself, trigger stranded

          costs.  In the absence of transmission access from the historical

          supplier of the retail customers, the new entity would have to

          remain on the historical supplier's generation system because it

          would have no way to reach other power suppliers, and stranded

          costs would not occur. 480/  Therefore, there is a causal nexus

          between the stranded costs and the availability and use of the

          tariff services required by the Commission. 481/  Moreover,

          because of this causal nexus between the use of a jurisdictional

          utility's Commission-required transmission tariff and the

          potential for foregone revenues by that jurisdictional utility as


               Exceptions would be self-generation or construction by the
               new entity of its own transmission line, in which case, as
               noted earlier, the stranded cost provisions of Order No. 888
               would not apply because such options have always been
               available as alternatives to purchasing power from the
               historical supplying utility and do not involve the use of
               the utility's transmission facilities under an open access
               tariff.  Thus the departure of customers under these
               circumstances cannot be linked to the open access
               requirements of this Rule.

               As discussed in greater detail in Sections IV.J.6 and
               IV.J.12 below, we clarify that the opportunity for recovery
               of stranded costs in a retail-turned-wholesale situation is
               limited to cases in which the former bundled retail customer
               subsequently becomes, either directly or through another
               wholesale transmission purchaser, an unbundled wholesale
               transmission services customer of its former supplier.  We
               have revised section 35.26(b)(1)(i) of the Commission's
               regulations accordingly.  





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -200-
            and RM94-7-002

          a result of the Commission-required access, the stranded costs

          associated with a retail-turned-wholesale customer are properly

          viewed as economic costs that are jurisdictional to this

          Commission.

               In contrast, in the situation in which a bundled retail

          customer obtains retail wheeling, stranded costs are directly

          caused by the availability and use of unbundled retail services

          required by the state commission, not this Commission. 482/ 

          Thus, the Commission believes that states, not the Commission,

          should be the primary forum for costs associated with a bundled

          retail customer that obtains retail wheeling.  The Commission's

          decision to entertain requests to recover stranded costs caused

          by retail wheeling in only a limited circumstance (where the

          state regulatory authority does not have authority under state

          law to address stranded costs when the retail wheeling is

          required) is based on a policy decision by this Commission that

          it will step in to fill a regulatory "gap" that could result in

          no effective forum in which utilities would have an opportunity

          to seek recovery of prudently incurred costs.

               Finally, after considering various proposals regarding how

          stranded costs should be calculated, and reviewing the arguments



               Unbundled retail transmission services required by a state
               commission could be taken under the same pro forma open
               access tariff used by wholesale customers or, if determined
               appropriate by the Commission, under a separate retail
               tariff filed at the Commission.  The critical point,
               however, is that in either case, the unbundled services are
               required by the state and not by this Commission.

          of petitioners on rehearing, the Commission continues to believe

          that the revenues lost approach is the fairest and most efficient

          way to determine the amount of stranded cost assigned to a

          departing customer during the transition to a competitive

          wholesale bulk power market.  The Commission has rejected an

          asset-by-asset approach as overly complicated and costly.

               We respond below to the specific arguments raised on

          rehearing and elaborate on the above determinations.

                    1.   Justification for Allowing Recovery of Stranded
                         Costs 

               In Order No. 888, the Commission concluded that utilities

          should be given the opportunity to seek recovery of legitimate,

          prudent and verifiable stranded costs associated with a limited

          set of wholesale requirements contracts executed on or before

          July 11, 1994. 483/  We stated that utilities that entered into

          contracts to make wholesale requirements sales under an entirely

          different regulatory regime should have an opportunity to recover

          stranded costs that occur as a result of customers leaving the

          utilities' generation systems through Commission-jurisdictional

          open access tariffs or FPA section 211 orders to reach other

          power suppliers.  We explained that utilities that made large

          capital expenditures or long-term contractual commitments to buy

          power years ago to supply their customers should not now be held

          responsible for failing to foresee the actions this Commission

          would take to alter the use of their transmission systems in


               FERC Stats. & Regs. at 31,788-91; mimeo at 451-58.





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -202-
            and RM94-7-002

          response to the fundamental changes that are taking place in the

          industry.  We found that recent significant statutory and

          regulatory changes are central to the circumstances that now

          place at risk the recovery of past investment decisions of

          utilities.  We indicated that we will not ignore the effects of

          these changes as we fashion policies that will govern possible

          recovery of these costs in the transition to an open access

          regulatory regime. 

               We stated that while there has always been some risk that a

          utility would lose a particular customer, in the past that risk

          was smaller.  It was not unreasonable for the utility to plan to

          continue serving the needs of its wholesale requirements

          customers and retail customers, and for those customers to expect

          the utility to plan to meet their future needs.  We concluded

          that with the new open access transmission, 484/ the risk of

          losing a customer is radically increased.  If a former wholesale

          requirements customer or a former retail customer uses the new


               In Order No. 888, we explained that by "new open access" or
               "open access transmission" we were referring to Commission-
               jurisdictional open access tariffs or to a tariff ordered
               pursuant to FPA section 211.  Although we generally refer in
               the text of Order No. 888 and the text of this order to the
               open access tariffs required under this Rule and to tariffs
               required pursuant to a section 211 order, we clarify that
               the "new open access" or "open access transmission"
               described in this Rule also includes transmission provided
               prior to Order No. 888 (and not pursuant to a section 211
               order) where such tariff filings were made on a case-by-case
               basis to comply with the Commission's comparability
               requirement.  To avoid any confusion on this point, we refer
               in this order to all such open access transmission as
               "Commission-mandated transmission access" or "Commission-
               required transmission access."  





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -203-
            and RM94-7-002

          open access to reach a new supplier, the utility is entitled to

          seek recovery of legitimate, prudent and verifiable costs that it

          incurred under the prior regulatory regime to serve that

          customer.  The utility, however, would have the burden of

          demonstrating that it had a reasonable expectation of continuing

          to serve the departing customer.

               Rehearing Requests Opposing, or Seeking Limitations on,
               Stranded Cost Recovery

               Several entities challenge the Commission's decision to give

          utilities an opportunity to recover legitimate, prudent and

          verifiable stranded costs.  NASUCA argues that the transition to

          wholesale competition was underway before and apart from the

          NOPR.  It asserts that the drivers of the developing competition

          include voluntary open access filings by utilities seeking

          mergers or market-based rate authority and section 211 of the

          FPA, as amended by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Energy Policy

          Act).  According to NASUCA, stranded investment results from

          legislative, not regulatory action, and the stranded cost issue

          does, and would, exist without the Open Access Rule.  It contends

          that an acceleration of the competitive wholesale transformation

          does not change its nature or origins.  NASUCA also contends that

          the issuance of the Open Access Rule does not justify stranded

          cost recovery on "regulatory compact" grounds because it is not a

          fundamental change.  

               Other entities object that there is no basis for the

          Commission to impute an extra-contractual obligation to serve

          wholesale requirements customers. 485/  These entities argue, for

          example, that utilities could and should have protected

          themselves from any potential stranded costs through individual

          customer contracts.

               IN Consumer Counselor and IN Consumers object that Order No.

          888 attempts to transform the obligation to provide a utility

          with an "opportunity" for a fair return when prices are regulated

          into an "entitlement" to "recover legitimate, prudent and

          verifiable costs that it incurred under the prior regulatory

          regime." 486/

               Several entities submit that the Commission has not

          adequately addressed the potential anticompetitive impact of

          stranded cost recovery. 487/  Some argue that giving utilities

          the opportunity to recover wholesale stranded costs will delay

          the opportunity for historically captive customers to benefit

          from competitive alternatives. 488/  Central Illinois Light

          contends that the Rule is arbitrary and capricious because it

          will have different impacts on different customers, which Central

          Illinois Light asserts will be due to accidents of circumstance

          rather than the conscious application of rational policy choices. 

          IN Consumers objects that two similarly-situated customers of the

          utility for identical transmission services will be required to

          pay substantially different rates for the same service (where one

          previously purchased its power requirements from the utility,

          while the other used an alternate source of supply).

               Central Illinois Light also objects that even a partial

          allowance of stranded costs will likely encourage predatory

          pricing.  It says that the Commission has failed to adequately

          address the harm that stranded cost "subsidies" pose to low-cost

          utilities with little or no stranded costs.  Others contend that

          the Rule would subvert economic efficiency by unjustly enriching

          utilities that have not attempted to meet the new market demands,

          to the detriment of those utilities that have. 489/  According to

          Occidental Chemical, the Commission has made no finding that the

          pro-competitive goals of Order No. 888 can be accomplished in

          light of the costs and uncertainties presented by stranded cost

          recovery. 

               Several entities also challenge the adequacy of the factual

          record for allowing wholesale stranded cost recovery and argue

          that utilities have not provided the hard data on wholesale

          stranded costs that the Commission needs to justify Order No.

          888. 490/  Central Illinois Light objects that the Commission

          failed to note or to discuss data presented by commenters showing

          that only a small group of high-cost utilities need some stranded

          cost protection.  American Forest & Paper argues that the

          Commission has failed to demonstrate on the record the existence

          of any stranded wholesale investment that was or could be caused

          by the transition to open access transmission.

               SC Public Service Authority repeats its earlier request that

          the Commission deny market-based rate authority to any utility

          that elects to recover stranded costs from departing customers.

          491/  It objects that the Commission failed to specifically

          respond to its previous comments on this issue.

               American Forest & Paper objects that utilities that

          voluntarily filed open access tariffs cannot use the stranded

          cost rule because their loss of customers cannot be said to have

          occurred only because of the Rule.  It submits that only those

          utilities who had to be forced to offer open access transmission

          are being rewarded.

               San Francisco asks that the Commission include "exercise of

          pre-existing contract rights for transmission and designation of

          ensure that PG&E would not have any basis to argue that any load

          loss PG&E suffers as a result of San Francisco's designation of

          municipal loads would be eligible for stranded cost recovery.

               Commission Conclusion

               We will deny the requests for rehearing of our decision to

          allow utilities an opportunity to seek recovery of legitimate,

          prudent, and verifiable stranded costs.  As we indicated in Order

          No. 888, we learned from our experience with natural gas that, as

          both a legal and a policy matter, we cannot ignore these costs. 

          The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit

          invalidated the Commission's first open access rule for gas

          pipelines because the Commission failed to deal with the

          uneconomic take-or-pay situation that many pipelines faced as a

          result of regulatory changes beyond their control. 492/  That

          same court has subsequently affirmed the Commission's decision to

          allow the recovery of costs that are stranded in the transition

          to a competitive natural gas industry, most recently by upholding

          the Commission's decision in Order No. 636 to allow the recovery

          of gas supply realignment costs. 493/

            and RM94-7-002

               Here we are faced, once again, with an industry transition

          in which there is the possibility that, as a result of statutory

          and regulatory changes beyond their control, certain utilities

          may be left with large unrecoverable, legitimate and prudent

          costs or that those costs will be unfairly shifted to other

          (remaining) customers.  Thus, in order to satisfy our regulatory

          responsibilities, we must directly and timely address the costs

          of the transition by allowing utilities to seek recovery of

          legitimate, prudent and verifiable stranded costs. 494/  While

          the transition to wholesale competition may have begun before the

          NOPR, we strongly disagree with NASUCA's claim that the Open

          Access Rule does not justify stranded cost recovery because an

          acceleration of the transition does not change its nature or

          origins.  The driving force behind the development of wholesale

          competitive markets is the widespread transmission access made

          available through Commission-mandated transmission tariffs, 495/

          including transmission tariffs ordered pursuant to FPA section

          211 and the transmission tariffs required by the Commission's

               As we explain above, Commission-mandated transmission
               tariffs is meant to include all open access tariffs filed
          pursuant to Commission order, including tariffs filed under this
          Rule, tariffs ordered pursuant to FPA section 211, and tariffs
          that were filed on a case-by-case basis to comply with the
          Commission's comparability requirement.

          Open Access Rule. 496/  Furthermore, as explained in the Rule and

          as further discussed below, it is the ability of customers to

          obtain readily available Commission-mandated transmission access

          that significantly increases the potential for wholesale stranded

          costs.

               Order No. 888 requires the functional unbundling of a public

          utility's wholesale services.  Under the Rule, all public

          utilities that own, control or operate facilities used for

          transmitting electric energy in interstate commerce were required

          by July 9, 1996 to file open access transmission tariffs that

          contain minimum terms and conditions of non-discriminatory

          service (or to seek waiver), and to take transmission service

          (including ancillary services) for their own new wholesale sales

          and purchases of electric energy under the open access tariffs. 

          As a result of Order No. 888, wholesale requirements customers



               As a result of the Open Access Rule, 47 Group 2 public
               utilities, which had no open access transmission tariff
               available prior to Order No. 888, submitted and had
               available on July 9, 1996 non-discriminatory open access
               transmission tariffs.  In addition, 101 Group 1 public
               utilities, which had some version of open access available
               prior to Order No. 888, filed new open access tariffs
               effective July 9, 1996 in order to conform to the terms and
               conditions of non-discriminatory open access service
               specified in the pro forma tariff.  Thus, as of July 9,
               1996, 148 of the 166 public utilities had filed Order No.
               888 open access tariffs.  At least ten others filed open
               access tariffs after July 9, 1996 (e.g., after the
               Commission dealt with their waiver requests).  This, in the
               Commission's view, represents an unprecedented acceleration
               of the transition to competitive bulk power markets.  From
               the issuance of the Open Access NOPR in March 1995 until the
               effective date of Order No. 888 on July 9, 1996 is only a
               little more than one year.





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -210-

          that previously were captive customers of their public utility

          suppliers (i.e., they had no choice but to take bundled sales and

          transmission services from their suppliers) will be able at the

          expiration of their contracts to take unbundled transmission

          service (i.e., transmission-only service) from their former

          suppliers in order to reach new suppliers.  While in the past

          there has been some risk of stranded costs due to customers

          "leaving" a supplier's system through self-generation or perhaps

          municipalization, there was little or no ability to shop for

          alternative power such as that which will occur as a result of

          readily available Commission-mandated transmission access. 

          Contrary to NASUCA's claims, Order No. 888, coupled with section

          211 of the FPA, creates the opportunity, as a matter of law, for

          an existing wholesale requirements customer to use the

          transmission owner's facilities to reach a new supplier. 497/ 


               NASUCA and other petitioners offer no persuasive evidence
               that meaningful competition took root prior to the
               availability of the new transmission access requirements. 
               The few utilities that did provide transmission service
               under open access tariffs prior to the announcement of the
               Commission's comparability requirement did not offer third
               parties comparable service.  To the contrary, such tariffs
               contained numerous disparities in the transmission service
               that the utilities provided to third parties in comparison
               to their own uses of the transmission system.  See, e.g.,
               Entergy Services, Inc., 58 FERC  61,234, order on reh'g, 60
          FERC  61,168 (1992), remanded, sub nom., Cajun Electric Power

          not provide network service; tariff reserved transmission
          provider's right to cancel service in certain instances, even
          where a customer had paid for transmission system modifications). 
          While the desire of customers for competitive power markets may
          have preceded Commission-mandated open access, customers had no
                                                             (continued...)





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -211-
            and RM94-7-002

          This leaves the former supplying utility with significant risk

          that it will be unable to recover costs that the utility incurred

          based on a reasonable expectation that it would continue to serve

          the departing customer.

               Thus, the regulatory and statutory changes contained in

          Order No. 888 and in amended section 211, which will act in

          tandem to provide the transmission access necessary to develop

          the competitive wholesale markets envisioned by Congress in the

          Energy Policy Act, have a direct nexus to the potential for

          wholesale stranded costs.  This nexus makes it critical that the

          Commission address this transition issue responsibly and

          equitably.  Having balanced the goals of competition, the nexus

          between potential stranded costs and transmission access, and the

          regulatory bargain under which utilities invested billions of

          dollars in reliance on the prior regulatory regime, we believe

          that utilities are entitled to an opportunity to seek recovery of

          stranded costs and that our actions in Order No. 888 are not only

          legally supportable, but also represent sound public policy.  

               In response to those entities who argue that there is no

          basis for imputing an extra-contractual obligation to serve

          wholesale requirements customers, as we explained in Order No.

          888, we believe there previously has been an implicit obligation

          to serve at wholesale in many cases.  Such obligation is based,


          (...continued)
          assurance they could reach alternative suppliers until the
          Commission required utilities to provide transmission service on
          a comparable basis.





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -212-
            and RM94-7-002

          in large part, on the recognition that historically most

          wholesale requirements customers were captive and had no means of

          reaching alternative suppliers.  The local utility supplied

          bundled generation and transmission services to these customers

          on the assumption that they would remain as customers. 

          Accordingly, the utility had a concomitant obligation to plan to

          supply these customers' continuing needs, and planned its system

          taking account of the wholesale load.  In many cases the

          wholesale customers participated by supplying load forecasts. 

          Consistent with this practical obligation to serve, the

          Commission viewed the supplying utility as the supplier of first

          resort, and did not allow a utility to terminate service without

          prior Commission approval.  Before Order No. 888, the

          Commission's regulations required prior notification and approval

          of the proposed cancellation or termination of a wholesale

          requirements contract.  We note that although Order No. 888

          eliminates the prior notice of cancellation or termination

          requirement for power sales contracts executed on or after July

          9, 1996 (the effective date of the Open Access Rule) that are to

          terminate by their own terms, 498/ it expressly retains the prior


               The Rule requires that the utility notify the Commission of
               the date of termination for this class of contracts within
               30 days after the termination takes place.  The Rule retains
               the prior notice of cancellation or termination requirement
               for power sales contracts executed on or after July 9, 1996
               if termination is on grounds other than expiration of the
               contract by its terms at the end of the contract.  See

               It is important to note, however, that while the stranded

          cost recovery provisions of the Rule are based on the implicit

          obligation to serve, the Rule does not guarantee any extra-

          contractual wholesale stranded cost recovery, much less across-

          the-board recovery of such costs by all public utilities.  To the

          contrary, it provides an opportunity for such recovery only for a

          discrete set of requirements contracts (those executed on or

          before July 11, 1994 that do not contain an exit fee or other

          explicit stranded cost provision), and the Rule requires that a

          utility must meet a heavy burden of proving eligibility to

          recover costs in a particular case:  before a departing customer

          is required to pay a stranded cost exit fee or transmission

          surcharge, the utility must demonstrate that it incurred costs to

          provide service to a customer based on a reasonable expectation

          of continuing service to that customer beyond the end of the

          contract. 499/

          assurance of the ability to perform).

               To the extent there is any misunderstanding, we clarify that
               the intent of the Rule to permit the "opportunity" to
               recover stranded costs is not an "entitlement" to recover
               such costs.  As a result, the passage in Order No. 888 to
               which IN Consumer Counselor and IN Consumers object (FERC
               Stats. & Regs. at 31,789, mimeo at 452-53) should read "we
          believe that the utility is entitled to an opportunity to recover

          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -214-

               We believe that we adequately address in both Order No. 888

          and in Section IV.J.2 below the concerns various entities have

          expressed as to the potential anticompetitive impact of stranded

          cost recovery.  Although we recognize that stranded cost recovery

          may delay some of the benefits of competitive bulk power markets

          for some customers, we believe that customers as a whole will

          benefit from a fair and orderly transition.  Indeed, we are

          particularly concerned that the failure to assign stranded cost

          responsibilities to customers that have access to alternative

          suppliers will leave captive customers exposed to the risk of

          greater cost burdens, thereby shifting to captive customers the

          costs that were originally incurred for the benefit of the

          (typically larger) customers who have the flexibility to take

          early advantage of competing power suppliers.  Avoiding this

          potential cost shifting problem is an important goal of our

          decision to address the stranded cost problem as part and parcel

          of the decision to mandate open access.  As we said in Order No.

          888: 

                    such transition costs must nevertheless be
                    addressed at an early stage if we are to
                    fulfill our regulatory responsibilities in
                    moving to competitive markets.  The stranded
                    cost recovery mechanism that we direct here
                    is a necessary step to achieve pro-
                    competitive results.  In the long term, the
                    Commission's Rule will result in more



          (...continued)
          legitimate, prudent and verifiable costs that it incurred under
          the prior regulatory regime to serve that customer" (emphasis to
          show added language).

                    consumers. [500/]

               We do not believe that allowing utilities an opportunity to

          seek stranded cost recovery will prevent us from achieving the

          pro-competitive goals of Order No. 888.  To the contrary, as

          discussed below in Section IV.J.3, we think that it is necessary

          to provide utilities the opportunity to seek to recover stranded

          costs if we are to have a fair and orderly transition to more

          competitive bulk power markets.  The opponents of Order No. 888's

          stranded cost approach argue that the transition to fully

          competitive bulk power markets will be slower if we allow

          utilities an opportunity to seek to recover stranded costs from

          departing customers, and with respect to some customers that may

          well be true.  As noted earlier, some customers because of their

          size and limited contractual obligations with their current

          utility suppliers have the ability immediately to leave the

          system.  If they are allowed to do so without paying the costs

          incurred to provide them expected future service, the economic

          attractiveness of departing the system is obviously enhanced and

          the benefits of competition, for these customers, obviously come

          sooner rather than later.  However, the pace at which fully

          competitive markets are achieved, while important, is not the

          only consideration.  It is the Commission's responsibility to

          ensure that the costs of open access are fairly assigned and that

          the benefits of Order No. 888's open access requirements will be

            and RM94-7-002

          fairly available to all customers.  These dual goals compel us

          toward a balanced approach that, although perhaps delaying

          somewhat the benefits of competition, nevertheless ensures that

          all customers will share in those benefits without undermining

          historic principles of cost recovery upon which utilities were

          entitled to rely in planning their systems.

               Moreover, as we explain in Section IV.J.3 below, we have

          carefully examined different methods of allocating stranded costs

          that are found to be properly recoverable, including assigning

          the costs directly to the departing customer or spreading the

          costs to all transmission users of a utility's system.  We

          recognize that the direct assignment approach to stranded cost

          recovery delays competition for some customers because it

          attaches a price tag for customers who have the immediate ability

          to leave the system.  However, we have identified the advantages

          and disadvantages of each approach and have concluded, on

          balance, that direct assignment is the preferable approach for

          both legal and policy reasons.

               In response to the concerns of some entities that stranded

          cost "subsidies" may harm low-cost utilities with little or no

          stranded costs, or otherwise may unjustly enrich utilities that

          have not attempted to meet the new market demands to the

          detriment of those that have, we again emphasize the limited and

          transitional nature of the stranded cost recovery opportunity

          allowed under Order No. 888. 501/  It is clearly not the

          Commission's intent that utilities with little or no stranded

          cost exposure be competitively disadvantaged by the Open Access

          Rule.  Those utilities with little or no stranded costs will be

          similarly situated with other new suppliers in the sense that

          they will all face the potential of not being able to compete

          immediately for certain wholesale customers who are determined to

          have an obligation to pay stranded costs.  These customers may

          find it to be uneconomic to shop from new power suppliers because

          they may have to pay costs they caused to be incurred under the

          prior industry regime before they are able to switch suppliers. 

          However, this will be during a transition period only, and only

          with respect to a discrete set of contracts and only where the

          utility meets its burden of proof with respect to a particular

          departing customer.

               We reject as misplaced IN Consumers' argument that the Open

          Access Rule is discriminatory because two "similarly-situated"

          customers for "identical" transmission services (one who

          previously purchased transmission bundled with its power

          requirements from the utility and now seeks to purchase only

          unbundled transmission, and the other who previously used an

          alternative source of supply and seeks to purchase unbundled

          transmission from the utility) will pay substantially different


               As we indicate in Section IV.J.9 below, we disagree that the
               Rule's definition of stranded costs artificially and
               unjustifiably improves the competitive position of an
               inefficient utility.





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -218-

          rates for the same service.  The error in this argument is that

          the two customers in the example are not "similarly-situated"

          precisely because one of them was a former bundled wholesale

          requirements customer of the utility for whom the utility may

          have incurred costs to meet reasonably expected customer demand,

          whereas the other was never a generation customer of the utility

          and thus appropriately bears no cost responsibility for stranded

          generation costs incurred by that utility.  Indeed, this example

          illustrates precisely the reason underlying the Commission's

          stranded cost mechanism.  If a utility had previously served a

          customer as a seller of generation as well as a transmitter, it

          is allowed an opportunity to show that it incurred costs based on

          a reasonable expectation of continuing to serve the power needs

          of that customer beyond the contract term.  Similarly, contrary

          to Central Illinois Light's claim, if different treatment of

          different customers were to occur, it would not be due to

          "accidents of circumstance" -- it would be the result of the

          conscious application by the Commission of its decision to give a

          utility the opportunity to recover stranded costs from a

          wholesale requirements customer if the utility can demonstrate

          that it incurred costs to provide service to the customer based

          on a reasonable expectation that it would continue to serve the

          customer after the contract term. 

               In response to the claims of those entities that challenge

          the factual record for allowing wholesale stranded cost recovery,

          we believe that the record in this proceeding clearly





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -219-
            and RM94-7-002

          demonstrates the need to give utilities the opportunity to

          recover wholesale stranded costs.  We have shown that the Rule's

          open access requirement will significantly alter historical

          relationships among traditional utilities and their customers. 

          Indeed, that is one of its objectives.  In the longer term, we

          seek to have all power supply arrangements priced by the

          competitive marketplace.  However, utilities prudently incurred

          costs under a prior regulatory regime that created an expectation

          of an opportunity for recovery of those costs.  Common sense

          indicates that a utility that historically supplied bundled

          generation and transmission services to a wholesale requirements

          customer and that reasonably expected to continue to serve the

          customer may have incurred costs to provide service to that

          customer that could be stranded if the customer uses open access

          transmission to reach a new generation supplier. 502/  As we

          learned from our experience in restructuring of the natural gas

          industry, open access and unbundling did in fact exacerbate the

          take-or-pay problems in the gas industry because it gave

          customers more options.  That is what we are doing in the

          electric industry as well.  As a result, we have concluded that

          utilities should be permitted to seek recovery of stranded costs

          in certain limited and defined circumstances.





               As the AGD court noted:  "Agencies do not need to conduct
               experiments in order to rely on the prediction that an
               unsupported stone will fall."  824 F.2d at 1008.





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -220-
            and RM94-7-002

               We disagree with those entities that argue that utilities

          have not provided sufficient data on the existence of wholesale

          stranded costs to justify the approach adopted by the Commission

          in Order No. 888.  Presumably these entities would require us to

          calculate specific stranded cost estimates for every public

          utility before we could act to address this critical issue. 

          However, where the Commission decides to act by means of a

          generic rule, 503/ the Commission is not required to make

          individual findings on a utility-by-utility basis. 504/ 

          Moreover, the Rule does not say that all utilities with wholesale

          contract customers will be allowed to recover stranded costs,

          only that those utilities that have requirements contracts that

          were executed on or before July 11, 1994 that do not contain an

          exit fee or explicit stranded cost provision and that can meet

          the required evidentiary showing would be allowed such recovery. 

          On this basis, our decision to give utilities the opportunity to

          seek stranded cost recovery for certain wholesale requirements

          contracts is not dependent on a showing that any particular

          utility will actually be eligible to recover stranded costs as a

          result of the open access requirement. 505/     


               As we noted in Order No. 888, there is no question that it
               is within the Commission's discretion to decide whether to
               act through rule or through case-by-case adjudication.  FERC

               We also will reject SC Public Service Authority's request

          that the Commission deny market-based rate authority for all

          utilities seeking stranded cost recovery.  SC Public Service

          Authority has failed to demonstrate that the ability to seek

          stranded cost recovery would, by definition, eliminate the

          potential for mitigation of any generation or transmission market

          power.  If an entity believes that a utility seeking market-based

          rate authority does not satisfy the Commission's criteria for the

          grant of market-rate authority (e.g., because the utility has, or

          has failed to mitigate, market power in generation or

          transmission), that entity will have ample opportunity to present

          its case in the market-based rate proceeding.

               American Forest & Paper's objection that utilities that

          voluntarily filed open access tariffs cannot utilize the stranded

          cost provisions and therefore that only utilities who were forced

          to offer open access transmission are being rewarded is

          misplaced.  First, there is nothing in Order No. 888 that

          prohibits a utility that voluntarily filed an open access

          transmission tariff from seeking recovery of stranded costs if it

          can demonstrate a reasonable expectation of continuing to serve a



          (...continued)
          stranded cost problem is widespread and huge.  Here we provide
          only the opportunity to seek stranded cost recovery for a
          concededly narrow subset of cases that we believe may give rise
          to a valid claim for extracontractual recovery.  If as
          petitioners suggest the problem is modest and confined to a small
          number of utilities, the evidentiary process will sort that out,
          and the potential effect on departing customers and on the pace
          of competition will be similarly modest.

          particular wholesale customer beyond the term of its existing

          contract.  Second, many of the "open access" tariffs accepted

          prior to Order No. 888, while an improvement upon the status quo

          of no access, did not contain the minimum terms and conditions of

          non-discriminatory service, including functional unbundling. 

          Order No. 888 required utilities that tendered for filing open

          access tariffs prior to the issuance of the Rule (Group 1 public

          utilities) to make section 206 compliance filings that contain

          the non-rate terms and conditions set forth in the Open Access

          Rule pro forma tariff.  That tariff expressly includes provisions

          allowing a transmission provider to seek to recover stranded

          costs in accordance with the terms, conditions and procedures set

          forth in Order No. 888.  Of the 101 public utilities that had

          some version of open access available prior to Order No. 888, all

          now have open access tariffs on file that contain provisions that

          expressly allow the transmission provider to seek to recover

          stranded costs as provided in Order No. 888.

               We also will decline San Francisco's request that the

          Commission include "exercise of pre-existing contract rights for

          transmission and designation of wholesale loads" or similar

          language as an example of a situation for which stranded costs

               expiration of an existing wholesale requirements contract
               (i.e., one that was executed on or before July 11, 1994).

               Rehearing Requests Seeking Broader Stranded Cost Recovery

               In sharp contrast to the entities seeking rehearing of the

          Commission's decision to allow stranded cost recovery, other

          entities ask the Commission to expand the scope of the stranded

          cost recovery allowed by Order No. 888.  Various entities ask

          that the scope of stranded cost recovery be expanded to include

          situations in which the departing customer does not take

          unbundled transmission from the former supplier and in which

          previously existing municipal utilities annex additional

          territory or otherwise expand. 508/  These entities disagree with

          the Commission's analysis in Order No. 888 that the opportunity

          to seek recovery should be precluded in situations in which the

          departing wholesale customer ceases to purchase power from the

          utility but does not use the utility's transmission system to

          reach another supplier.  The Commission excluded these situations

          because the costs would not be stranded as a result of the

          Commission's open access transmission requirement, but rather as



               San Francisco will have sufficient opportunity to raise the
               argument in any PG&E stranded cost recovery case.

               E.g., EEI, Coalition for Economic Competition, Puget,
               Centerior, Southern.  The issue of expanding the rule to
               encompass municipal annexations and expansions is discussed
               in greater detail in Section IV.J.6 below.





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -224-
            and RM94-7-002

          a result of the exercise of a preexisting competitive option. 

          The entities argue on rehearing that such costs are attributable

          to the Commission's efforts to restructure the wholesale power

          market.  Several argue that there is no good policy reason for

          addressing stranded costs only where linked directly to the Open

          Access Rule or section 211 orders because a variety of federal

          actions, not just the Open Access Rule and section 211 orders,

          have created a competitive wholesale power market and the specter

          of stranded costs caused by customers departing their traditional

          utility.  They contend that, but for the Commission's creation of

          a vibrant power market, EPAct, and other pre-Order No. 888

          efforts by the Commission to expand transmission access, the

          preexisting options would not have been (and historically were

          not) exercised.

               Puget argues that even when a departing customer can import

          its new power supply without using its former supplier's

          transmission system, it frequently will be the case that the

          power supply would not be available to the customer if open

          access transmission rules were not in place to permit that power

          to move from distant generators over intervening utilities'

          transmission facilities. 509/

               EEI expresses concern that strict application of the "but

          for open access" test would create new incentives to evade


               Puget submits that the potential for customers not taking
               unbundled transmission services from their former suppliers
               is particularly acute in the Pacific Northwest due to BPA's
               ownership of much of the region's transmission facilities.





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -225-
            and RM94-7-002

          stranded cost recovery. 510/  According to EEI, the Rule would

          deny recovery for costs stranded pursuant to a voluntarily

          negotiated transmission service agreement, but would permit

          recovery if such agreement were ordered pursuant to FPA section

          211.  In this manner, EEI contends that the Rule will discourage

          parties from settling transmission disputes.  It says that any

          transmission agreement negotiated under "the threat" of section

          211 should be entitled to stranded cost recovery if providing

          service results in the stranding of legitimate and prudent costs.

               PSE&G and Carolina P&L express concern that denying stranded

          cost recovery where the departing customer does not use the

          former supplier's transmission system will create an artificial

          incentive to build "contract path" lines designed to thwart

          stranded cost recovery.  They maintain that the existence of

          alternative transmission paths should not be a bar to stranded

          cost recovery where the departing customer avails itself of the

          Commission's Mobile-Sierra finding permitting customers to

          challenge the terms of their contracts under the just and

          reasonable standard.  They assert that, notwithstanding the


               NIMO contends that the Commission erred by failing to
               address the extent to which Order No. 888's exceptions to
               the general policy of full stranded cost recovery (e.g., no
               recovery for customer use of new transmission provider or
               municipal annexations) create an opportunity for customers
               to avoid payment of part or all of their share of utility
               stranded costs, will enable customers to take advantage of
               such opportunities in ways that will reduce rather than
               enhance overall economic efficiency, and will deprive
               utilities of a reasonable opportunity to recover their
               prudently incurred costs or will shift costs unfairly among
               customers.  See also Puget.

          availability of alternative transmission, the only way that the

          customer could have availed itself of the Mobile-Sierra finding

          was as a result of the Commission's Open Access Rule.  

               Several entities contend that the FPA's requirement of just

          and reasonable rates and the Fifth Amendment's requirement to

          avoid confiscation require the Commission to address stranded

          costs that result when a departing customer does not use the

          former supplier's transmission system or that result from

          municipal annexation. 511/  According to Puget, the ultimate

          Constitutional test will be whether Order No. 888 will afford a

          fair overall return on all prudent utility investments under the

          Constitutional standards set forth by the Supreme Court. 512/ 

          Coalition for Economic Competition submits that, as was the case

          in the context of the unbundling of natural gas pipelines, the

          Commission cannot ignore stranded costs resulting from the

          unbundling of electric services and should acknowledge its


               E.g., Puget, Coalition for Economic Competition, NIMO. 
               These parties make a similar argument in the case of
               stranded costs that result from retail wheeling.  See
               Section IV.J.7 below.

               Puget cites in support Stone v. Farmers' Loan & Trust
               Company, 116 U.S. 307, 331 (1886); Federal Power Commission
               v. Hope Natural Gas Company, 320 U.S. 591, 602 (1944); and
               Duquesne Light Company v. Barasch, 488 U.S 299, 307-08
               (1989).  Puget objects that the stranded cost recovery
               mechanism in Order No. 888 is too narrow and too easy to
          circumvent; it can be denied for failure to satisfy the
          reasonable expectation test or based on a finding that costs are
          not legitimate and verifiable.  Puget argues that stranded cost
          recovery is constitutionally required and that the recovery
          mechanism must be amended to ensure full recovery of prudently
          incurred stranded costs, including PURPA contract costs.





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -227-
            and RM94-7-002

          Constitutional obligations to address the recovery of all

          stranded costs, including those that result from municipal

          expansion and those that result when a customer does not obtain

          transmission services from its former supplier.

               SC Public Service Authority also asks the Commission to

          allow the recovery of stranded costs that result from the loss of

          indirect customers (e.g., customers of wholesale requirements

          customers).  It argues that if such indirect customers can get

          access to a new source of power through open access tariffs, the

          requirements of the utility's direct customer will decrease, and

          the supplying utility will suffer stranded costs.  SC Public

          Service Authority states that because of the nexus between open

          access and the departure of the indirect customer, utilities that

          suffer stranded costs in the event of the loss of an indirect

          customer should have an opportunity to recover those costs under

          the reasonable expectation standard.  

               A number of entities also ask the Commission to find that

          open access transmission and stranded cost recovery are necessary

               Southern requests that the Commission add a section 35.29 to
               the regulatory text providing:  "Sections 35.26 and 35.28 of
               this part constitute unseverable portions of a unitary
               action of the Commission."

          their position that deletion or substantial change of the open

          access or stranded cost provisions by the Commission or by a

          court would vitiate the basis on which the Commission premised

          the Rule.

               In an effort to ensure that stranded cost recovery

          procedures do not become a vehicle for lengthy and expensive

          litigation over whether there is a sufficient nexus to open

          access, several entities ask the Commission to place on the

          departing generation customers the burden to demonstrate the

          absence of a nexus between their actions and the availability of

          open access transmission under the Rule in those cases where: 

          (i) the contract has no term or termination provision; (ii) the

          Commission issues an order under section 206 reducing the term of

          the contract; or (iii) there is legitimate municipalization. 514/

               Commission Conclusion     

               We will deny the requests for rehearing that ask us to

          expand the scope of stranded cost recovery to include situations

          in which the departing customer does not take unbundled

          transmission from its former supplier but instead obtains

          transmission from another utility or obtains power from a third

          party supplier who is located in the customer's service territory

          and thus requires no transmission from the former supplier. 515/ 


               E.g., Carolina P&L, PSE&G.

               We discuss in Section IV.J.6 below our disposition of the
                                                             (continued...)





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -229-
            and RM94-7-002

          As the Commission stated in Order No. 888, the premise of the

          Rule is that where the former requirements supplier had a

          reasonable expectation of serving beyond the contract term and

          the customer uses the open access transmission tariff of its

          former requirements supplier to obtain power from a new

          generation supplier, the customer must pay the costs that were

          incurred on its behalf under the prior regulatory regime.  The

          Rule is not intended, however, to apply to the recovery of costs

          associated with the normal risks of competition, such as self-

          generation, cogeneration, or loss of load, that do not arise from

          the new, accelerated availability of non-discriminatory open

          access transmission.  If a customer leaves its utility supplier

          by exercising options that could have been undertaken prior to

          mandatory transmission under Order No. 888 or the Energy Policy

          Act, or that do not rely on access to the former seller's

          transmission (such as access to another power supplier through




          (...continued)
          rehearing requests that support recovery of costs stranded as a
          result of municipal annexation or expansion.  In response to
          EEI's argument that the Rule would deny recovery for costs
          stranded pursuant to a voluntarily-negotiated transmission
          service agreement and would discourage parties from settling
          transmission disputes, we find EEI's arguments in support of its
          position to be vague and cursory.  However, we do not interpret
          the Rule in any way as precluding parties from addressing
          stranded cost issues through settlement, including settlement of
          a transmission dispute.  To the contrary, we fully expect that
          the renegotiation of contracts, including transmission
          agreements, would provide parties with a useful means for
          resolving stranded cost issues without litigation.  We believe
          that a negotiated rate that includes an amount for stranded cost
          recovery could be found to be just and reasonable.





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -230-

          another utility's transmission system or self-generation), there

          is no direct nexus to Commission-mandated transmission access.

               For example, if a customer is able to obtain power from a

          new supplier by using the transmission system of another utility,

          it is likely that the customer could have made these arrangements

          in the absence of the new open access rules.  The new

          transmission provider would have had little incentive to deny

          transmission services to the customer in order to protect another

          utility's existing power supply arrangement, since it was not the

          customer's power supplier in the first place.  As Order No. 888

          suggested, it is likely that the neighboring utility would have a

          positive incentive to provide the transmission service in order

          to increase its transmission revenues, and that this incentive is

          unchanged by open access transmission. 516/

               Although EEI and others argue that EPAct and the

          Commission's pre-Order No. 888 efforts to expand transmission

          access have facilitated the exercise of pre-existing competitive

          options, the fact remains that such options historically were

          available before open access.  For this reason, we conclude that

          costs incurred as a result of the exercise of pre-existing

          competitive options do not fall within the scope of Order No.

          888. 

               A number of entities argue that, even where the departing

          customer obtains access to another power supplier through the

          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -231-
            and RM94-7-002

          transmission system of another utility (i.e., not that of its

          former supplier), the power supply would not have been available

          to the customer if open access transmission rules were not in

          place to permit that power to move from distant generators over

          intervening utilities' transmission facilities.  Some argue that

          there is no good policy reason for addressing stranded costs only

          where linked directly to the Open Access Rule (or to a section

          211 order) because a variety of federal actions have created a

          competitive wholesale power market and the specter of stranded

          costs caused by customers departing their traditional utility. 

          While these arguments may have superficial appeal, the effective

          result would be to provide for recovery of stranded costs from

          departing customers under the Rule no matter how tenuous the

          nexus to Commission-mandated transmission access.  The Commission

          has to exercise reasonable judgment and reasonable line drawing

          regarding the link between its actions in this Rule and the

          decision to allow an opportunity for extra-contractual stranded

          cost recovery from the departing customer.  The Commission

          believes that requiring a direct nexus between Commission-

          mandated transmission access (namely, requiring that the

          departing customer obtain access to another power supplier

          through the use of its former supplier's Commission-required

          tariff -- i.e., an open access tariff or a tariff ordered

          pursuant to section 211) and the special stranded cost recovery

          procedures of this Rule is the most reasoned and supportable

          approach because it establishes a clear link between availability





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -232-
            and RM94-7-002

          of the transmission tariff and the decision of the customer to

          seek an alternative supplier.

               With regard to potential stranded costs associated with

          situations that could have occurred prior to the Open Access Rule

          and prior to the Energy Policy Act (such as self-generation),

          under traditional ratemaking such costs (albeit not previously

          labeled as potential "stranded" costs) would in most cases be

          reallocated in the next rate case to remaining customers.  The

          fact that this Rule does not permit a utility to seek recovery of

          these types of costs from the departing customer does not mean

          that the Commission may not, in appropriate circumstances, permit

          their recovery through traditional ratemaking means.  However,

          many factors will influence cost recovery in the future,

          including whether the utility is selling at cost-based or market-

          based rates and the transitional period to more competitive bulk

          power markets.  The Commission will address these matters on a

          case-by-case basis.   

               We do not agree with those commenters who contend that the

          Commission's failure in Order No. 888 to allow for the recovery

          of costs incurred by a utility when a departing customer does not

          use the former supplier's transmission system to reach a new

          supplier would be confiscatory in violation of the Constitution. 

          As the Supreme Court explained in Duquesne, "[t]he guiding

          principle has been that the Constitution protects utilities from

          being limited to a charge for their property serving the public





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -233-
            and RM94-7-002

          which is so 'unjust' as to be confiscatory." 517/  However, Order

          No. 888 addresses only the recovery of legitimate, prudent and

          verifiable costs that are stranded if a former wholesale

          requirements customer or a former retail customer uses a

          Commission-mandated transmission tariff to reach a new supplier. 

          As discussed above, Order No. 888 does not by its terms bar the

          recovery of costs that do not result from the use of Commission-

          required transmission access (i.e., costs that result when a

          departing customer does not use the former supplying utility's

          open access tariff).  Utilities may, as before, seek recovery of

          such non-open access-related costs on a case-by-case basis in

          individual rate proceedings.  The Commission will not prejudge

          those issues here.  As a result, the argument that the

          Commission's treatment of stranded costs in Order No. 888 (i.e.,

          its failure to treat certain costs as costs for which recovery

          may be sought under the Rule) will result in rates that will be

          so unjust as to be confiscatory is misplaced.

               We deny SC Public Service Authority's request that the

          Commission allow a utility to seek recovery of stranded costs

          that result from the loss of indirect customers (i.e., the loss

          of the utility's customer's customers).  The Commission does not

          believe it is appropriate or feasible to allow a public utility

          (or a transmitting utility under section 211 of the FPA) to seek

          recovery of stranded costs from an indirect customer (i.e., a



               488 U.S. at 307.





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -234-
            and RM94-7-002

          customer of a wholesale requirements customer of the utility). 

          The reasonable expectation analysis would apply only to the

          direct wholesale customer of the utility, not to the indirect

          customer.  A utility may seek to recover stranded costs from a

          direct wholesale customer (subject to the requirements of the

          Rule), but it is up to the direct wholesale customer, through its

          contracts with its customers or through the appropriate

          regulatory authority, to seek to recover stranded costs from its

          customers.   

               We also deny PSE&G's and Carolina P&L's request that a

          utility be allowed to seek stranded cost recovery in cases where

          the departing customer uses the Commission's Mobile-Sierra

          finding to get out of the contract under the just and reasonable

          standard and uses alternative suppliers and alternative

          transmission. 518/  We disagree with their argument that the only

          way that the customer could have availed itself of a Mobile-

          Sierra finding was as a result of the Commission's open access

          rules and thus the necessary nexus is met.  A customer to a

          Mobile-Sierra contract always has the option of instituting a

          proceeding under section 206 of the FPA and making a showing of

          why, under Mobile-Sierra, it is in the public interest to modify

          the contract.


               These parties appear to refer to a situation in which a
               customer is able to modify or terminate its contract, but
               would use the transmission system of a utility other than
               that of its former supplier in order to reach a new
               generation supplier.  In this circumstance, the Rule would
               not permit the former supplier to seek stranded costs.





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -235-
            and RM94-7-002

               We will not, at this time, make any determination whether or

          not the requirements of open access transmission and stranded

          cost recovery are severable.  As we indicated in Order No. 888,

          we issued the Stranded Cost Final Rule simultaneously with the

          Open Access Rule because we believe that the recovery of

          legitimate, prudent and verifiable stranded costs is critical to

          the successful transition of the electric industry to a

          competitive, open access environment. 519/  We believe that our

          decision to allow stranded cost recovery will be upheld by the

          courts.  Moreover, as we discuss in Section IV.A.1 above, it

          would be premature to consider at this time what the Commission

          would do if one or more of the provisions of the Rule are not

          upheld.  Circumstances at the time of any court order would

          dictate how we should proceed and we would consider all such

          circumstances, and the entirety of our policy decisions, before

          determining how to respond to a court decision.

               Further, we decline to place on departing generation

          customers the burden of demonstrating that no nexus exists

          between their actions and the availability of open access

          transmission under the Rule in cases involving no term or

          termination provision, an order under section 206 reducing the

          term of the contract, or municipalization.  The proponents of

          such a proposal, Carolina P&L and PSE&G, attempt to justify it as

          a means to ensure that stranded cost recovery procedures do not

          become a vehicle for lengthy and expensive litigation over

          whether there is a sufficient nexus to open access in the three

          identified situations.  However, Order No. 888 places the burden

          on the utility seeking stranded cost recovery to demonstrate that

          the costs for which it seeks recovery fall within the scope of

          the Rule and that it had a reasonable expectation of continuing

          service.  In this regard, the Rule tracks the requirement of

          sections 205 and 206 of the FPA that a public utility demonstrate

          the justness and reasonableness of its proposed rates.  Carolina

          P&L and PSE&G fail to explain why it would be appropriate for

          customers (as opposed to the utilities seeking recovery) in the

          three identified situations to bear the initial burden of

          demonstrating why costs should not be recovered from them under

          the Rule. 520/  As a result, we reject their proposal. 521/

               Rehearing Requests -- Stranded Cost Recovery By Transmitting
               Utilities That Are Not Public Utilities

               A number of entities contend that the Commission's decision

          to limit stranded cost recovery for transmitting utilities that

          are not public utilities to section 211 proceedings is



               In addition, the proposal would not eliminate lengthy
               litigation.  It would only change the burden of proof in
               whatever litigation occurs.

               We note, however, that in a section 206 proceeding brought
               by a customer seeking to shorten or terminate a contract,
               the customer has the burden (as it would in any section 206
               case that it initiates) of presenting sufficient evidence
               that the contract is no longer just and reasonable.  As we
               stated in the Rule, the utility must present any stranded
               cost claim at that time.  See FERC Stats. & Regs. at 31,664,

          inconsistent with its decision to impose the reciprocity

          requirement on those utilities, violative of the principle of

          comparability, and unduly discriminatory and anticompetitive.

          522/  NRECA submits that if the Commission has the statutory

          authority to require non-public utilities to render transmission

          service outside of a section 211 proceeding through the

          reciprocity, RTG and power pool provisions of the Rule, then it

          must exercise that authority to ensure stranded cost recovery by

          such non-public utilities.  Noting that the Rule does not address

          how a non-public utility that chooses voluntarily to provide an

          open access tariff can recover its stranded costs, SC Public

          Service Authority asks the Commission to confirm on rehearing

          that non-jurisdictional utilities can include a provision for

          recovery of stranded costs in their tariffs provided pursuant to

          the Final Rule.  

               Commission Conclusion

               The Commission's jurisdiction over the recovery of stranded

          costs by non-public utilities, and thus our ability to permit an

          opportunity for recovery of such costs, is limited by statute. 

          While we have the statutory authority to ensure that non-public

          utilities have the opportunity to seek recovery of stranded costs

          in proceedings under sections 211 and 212 of the FPA, 523/ we do


               E.g., NRECA, TDU Systems, Dairyland Coop.

               Stranded costs could also conceivably arise as a result of
               an ordered interconnection under section 210.  However, the

          not have such authority under sections 205 and 206 of the FPA. 

          However, we clarify that nothing in the Final Rule was intended

          to preclude non-public utilities from including stranded cost

          provisions in voluntary reciprocity tariffs or from otherwise

          recovering stranded costs under applicable law.  We discuss these

          matters in detail below.

               As we stated in Order No. 888 in response to commenters'

          objections that the Rule would give public utilities a greater

          opportunity than other transmitting utilities to recover stranded

          costs, our jurisdiction over transmitting utilities that are not

          also public utilities is limited.  If the selling utility is a

          transmitting utility that is not a public utility, its power

          sales contracts are not subject to this Commission's jurisdiction

          under sections 205 and 206 of the FPA.  Thus, we can provide such

          a transmitting utility an opportunity to recover stranded costs

          only through Commission-jurisdictional transmission rates fixed

          under sections 211 and 212 of the FPA. 524/

          to all open access customers that own, operate, or control

          pursuant to section 212 and could therefore also include stranded
          costs.

               FERC Stats. & Regs. at 31,791; mimeo at 458.  If such a
               transmitting utility seeks stranded cost recovery in a
               proceeding under sections 211 and 212, it would, consistent
               with the provisions of the Rule, be limited to recovery
               associated with requirements contracts executed on or before
               July 11, 1994 that do not contain an exit fee or other
               explicit stranded cost provision.

          operate or control such facilities, and that do not obtain a

          waiver of the provision, does not create jurisdiction for the

          Commission to fix the rates for these utilities.  Contrary to the

          suggestions of some, the tariff reciprocity provision is not

          based on any statutory authority of the Commission to require

          non-public utilities to render transmission service outside of a

          section 211 proceeding.  As we make clear in Order No. 888, we do

          not have authority under sections 205 and 206 of the FPA to

          require non-public utilities to file tariffs (or rate schedules

          for that matter) with the Commission. 525/  In permitting a

          public utility to deny transmission service to any person that

          requests service under an open access tariff unless that person

          provides reciprocal non-discriminatory transmission services to

          the transmission provider, we are not acting under any statutory

          authority to require non-public utilities to provide transmission

          access.  Rather, out of fairness, we are conditioning the use of

          open access services by all customers, including non-public

          utilities, on an agreement to offer comparable transmission

          services in return to the public utility transmission provider.

          a stranded cost provision in its tariff.  However, adjudication

          non-public utilities.  If a non-public utility wishes to recover

          stranded costs pursuant to a tariff or otherwise, it can seek to

          do so subject to the review of the appropriate regulatory

               Rehearing Requests -- Stranded Cost Recovery for
               Transmission Dependent Utilities

               NRECA and TDU Systems challenge the Commission's decision

          not to guarantee a transmission dependent utility that is not a

          public utility stranded cost recovery when the transmission

          dependent utility's customers leave its system by using the open


               Although the Commission would not determine the rate,
               including the stranded cost component of the rate, of a non-
               public utility, we would review a public utility's claim
               that it is entitled to deny service to a non-public utility
               because the stranded cost component of the non-public
               utility's transmission rate is being applied in a way that
               violates the principle of comparability.

               We note that in the case of stranded cost claims presented
               to the Commission by BPA or one of the other PMAs, our
               review would be limited to that set forth in the applicable
               statutes and any relevant delegation of authority from the
               Secretary of Energy.  See, e.g., Pacific Northwest Electric

          access tariff of another utility.  They submit that the ability

          of transmission dependent utilities to compete with public

          utility transmission providers in an open access environment

          would be severely affected by their inability to recover stranded

          costs on a basis comparable to those transmission providers. 

          They argue that the open access provisions of Order No. 888 will

          result in the stranding of costs incurred by non-transmission

          owning, non-public utilities to serve customers that depart to

          other suppliers.  They contend that these customers are already

          located in close proximity to, and interconnected to, public

          utilities; thus it is likely that they would use the open access

          tariffs of these public utilities to obtain their new power

          supplies.  NRECA and TDU Systems argue that this situation should

          meet the "but for open access" nexus.  On this basis, they assert

          that Order No. 888 is no less the proximate cause of the

          departure of customers of transmission dependent utilities than

          it is of the departure of public utility transmission owners'

          customers.  They object that the Commission takes no account of

          the anticompetitive effects of disregarding costs stranded on

          transmission dependent utilities' systems as a result of open

          access.  

               Dairyland Coop asks the Commission to recognize a generation

          and transmission (G&T) cooperative and its member distribution

          cooperatives as a single economic unit for purposes of stranded

          cost recovery (such that conversion of a distribution

          cooperative's retail customer to a wholesale customer may result

          Commission implicitly rejected comments to this effect without

          discussion in Order No. 888.

               Commission Conclusion

               We deny the requests for rehearing of our decision not to

          permit transmission dependent utilities and electric cooperatives

          to seek stranded cost recovery unless they are public utilities

          or transmitting utilities that would otherwise qualify under the

          Rule.  With regard to transmission dependent utilities, as we

          indicated in Order No. 888, the limited opportunity for stranded

          cost recovery contained in the Rule would not likely apply in the

          case of transmission dependent utilities, who own little or no

          transmission and the majority of whom would not be public

          utilities or transmitting utilities subject to the Commission's

          jurisdiction. 529/  The opportunity for extra-contractual

          wholesale stranded cost recovery is allowed only where the

          departing customers use open access (or section 211 access) on

          the transmission systems of their former generation suppliers and

          only for a discrete set of requirements contracts executed on or

          before July 11, 1994 that do not contain explicit stranded cost

          provisions (involving the bundled provision of generation and

          transmission) and retail-turned-wholesale situations for which

          the utility can demonstrate that it had a reasonable expectation

          of continuing service.  Even though it may be the case that

          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -243-
            and RM94-7-002

          transmission dependent utilities lose generation customers that

          are able to use open access tariffs of other utilities to reach

          new suppliers, there was nothing to keep these other utilities

          from offering such transmission service before Order No. 888. 

          These other utilities had no economic incentive to deny such

          service before Order No. 888.  Thus, in the scenario posited in

          the rehearings, the transmission dependent utilities do not meet

          the fundamental premise of the Rule:  that a utility that

          historically has supplied bundled generation and transmission

          services to a wholesale requirements customer and incurred costs

          to meet reasonably expected customer demand should have an

          opportunity to recover legitimate, prudent and verifiable costs

          that may be stranded because open access use of the utility's

          transmission system enables a generation customer to shop for

          power. 530/

               However, this is not to say that a transmission dependent

          utility that is not a public utility, or other non-public utility

          entities (such as RUS-financed cooperatives), cannot seek

          recovery of the cost of any resulting uneconomic assets through

          their contracts with their customers or through the appropriate

          regulatory authority.  The Commission has no objection to these

          entities being able to seek such cost recovery through the

          appropriate regulatory channels.  However, because the Commission

          does not have jurisdiction over these entities (other than

            and RM94-7-002

          through sections 211 and 212 in the case of non-public utility

          transmitting utilities), it does not have authority to allow them

          to recover these costs. 531/

               We also deny Dairyland Coop's request that the Commission

          recognize a G&T cooperative and its member distribution

          cooperatives as a single economic unit for purposes of stranded

          cost recovery.  If a cooperative obtains its financing through

          RUS, it is not a public utility subject to our jurisdiction under

          sections 205 and 206 of the FPA.  Although the Commission has no

          objection to these G&T cooperatives being able to seek cost

          recovery (including recovery of costs on behalf of their

          distribution cooperatives) through the appropriate regulatory

          channels, this Commission does not have authority to allow them

          to seek recovery of stranded costs unless access is obtained

          through a section 211 order. 532/

               In the case of a G&T cooperative that is a public utility

          (of which there are just a handful at the present time), such a

          cooperative would have to have a jurisdictional wholesale



               Unless these entities own some transmission used in
               interstate commerce or are engaged in sales for resale, and
               are not otherwise exempt under FPA section 201(f), they
               would not be public utilities under sections 205 and 206. 
               Most transmission dependent utilities are not public
               utilities.

               A G&T cooperative that is a transmitting utility could seek
               recovery of stranded costs if it is ordered to provide
               transmission services that permit its distribution
               cooperative to reach another supplier and if it had a
               requirements contract with the distribution cooperative that
               was executed on or before July 11, 1994.





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -245-
            and RM94-7-002

          requirements contract with its distribution cooperative in order

          to be able to seek recovery of stranded costs under the Rule.  In

          the case of a jurisdictional G&T cooperative, the request that

          the G&T be treated as a single economic unit with the

          distribution cooperative (such that departure of a distribution

          cooperative's retail customer would be treated as resulting in

          stranded costs for the G&T cooperative for which the G&T could

          seek recovery) is, in effect, a request for recovery of stranded

          costs from an indirect customer.  As we discuss above, the

          Commission does not believe it is appropriate or feasible to

          allow a public utility (or a transmitting utility under section

          211 of the FPA) to seek recovery of stranded costs from an

          indirect customer (i.e., a customer of a wholesale requirements

          customer of the utility) under this Rule.  The reasonable

          expectation analysis would apply only to the direct wholesale

          customer of the utility, not to the indirect customer.  It is up

          to the direct wholesale customer of the utility, through its

          contracts with its customers or through the appropriate

          regulatory authority, to seek to recover such costs from its

          customers.

               Commenters have provided no basis for making an exception in

          the case of cooperatives.  Moreover, to treat a G&T cooperative

          and its member distribution cooperatives as a single economic

          unit for stranded cost purposes would be inconsistent with the

          Commission's decision not to treat cooperatives as a single unit

          for purposes of Order No. 888's reciprocity provision.    





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -246-
            and RM94-7-002

               In Order No. 888, in response to arguments raised by

          cooperatives, the Commission agreed to limit the reciprocity

          requirement to corporate affiliates.  In other words, if a G&T

          cooperative seeks open access transmission service from the

          transmission provider, only the G&T cooperative (not its member

          distribution cooperatives) would be required to offer

          transmission service.  If a member distribution cooperative 

          itself receives transmission service from the transmission

          provider, then it (but not its G&T cooperative) must offer

          reciprocal transmission service over its interstate transmission

          facilities, if any. 533/  Dairyland has provided no basis to

          support treating cooperatives differently for stranded cost

          purposes and reciprocity purposes.  We accordingly will deny

          Dairyland's request for rehearing on this issue.

               Rehearing Requests Opposing Limitation of Recovery to
               Wholesale Requirements Customers 

               PA Munis argues that it is inequitable and anticompetitive

          for "wholesale requirements customers" but not other "wholesale

          customers" to have to pay stranded costs, repeating an argument

          that it made in its comments on the supplemental stranded cost

          NOPR.  It says that there is no difference in the firm power

          provided by public utilities to "wholesale requirements

          customers" and to "wholesale customers" and no difference in the

          generating facilities required and the costs of operation between

          the production of firm capacity and energy required for

          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -247-
            and RM94-7-002

          "wholesale requirements sales" and "wholesale sales."  PA Munis

          submits that the total amount of wholesale requirements power

          purchased in the United States is less than two percent of the

          total amount of firm power sales.  It argues that requiring only

          wholesale requirements customers to pay stranded costs would

          restrict the ability of such customers to switch suppliers while

          not similarly restricting large firm wholesale customers.  It

          contends that wholesale firm requirements customers therefore

          will not have equal access under the Rule because of the

          increased transmission rates for stranded costs that would not be

          levied on other large wholesale firm customers.  Pa Munis says

          this produces the same result found unlawful in the Maryland

          People's Counsel case 534/ -- equal access to all wholesale

          customers is virtually denied by the chilling effect of stranded

          costs borne only by wholesale requirements customers.

               Commission Conclusion

               In Order No. 888, the Commission fully addressed the

          concerns of PA Munis.  We again address below the major

          distinctions between requirements and other customers and deny

          rehearing.

               In Order No. 888, we explained that the historical and

          service, justifies allowing public utilities the opportunity to

          seek to recover the stranded costs covered by this Rule from only

          those customers and not from non-requirements customers that

          contract separately for transmission services to deliver their

          purchased power or from wholesale customers that purchase non-

          requirements power.  Requirements customers historically were

          long-term customers who by definition depended upon their local

          suppliers because they were captive customers.  Utilities had no

          obligation to provide transmission service that would allow these

          customers to reach other suppliers, and there were no other

          transmission facilities in proximity to those of the supplying

          utility.  And the service involved requirements power; that is,

          these customers were dependent upon the wholesale supplier for

          all or part of their power.  Utilities thus assumed they would

          continue serving these customers and may have made significant

          investments based on that long-term expectation.  These same

          assumptions cannot be made for short-term, non-firm transactions

          and other wholesale non-requirements firm transactions.  Unlike

          requirements customers, these customers had other options.  Thus,

          the supplying utility could not assume that these customers would

          remain on its system.

               With regard to short-term transactions, utilities did not

          (and do not today) generally make investments for short-term

          economy-type transactions.  Rather, such transactions were

          entered into only when the utility temporarily had available

          capacity or energy that could be provided to the buyer at a price





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -249-
            and RM94-7-002

          higher than the seller's incremental cost and lower than the

          buyer's decremental cost.  The utility was not obligated in any

          way -- either explicitly or implicitly -- to provide for the

          needs of coordination customers.  Because coordination

          transactions were not the cause of stranded investment decisions,

          it would be inappropriate to allocate such costs to non-

          requirements customers. 535/

               With regard to long-term, non-requirements firm

          transactions, such as unit power sales contracts, we note that

          there was no implied obligation to serve customers to these

          transactions as there was for requirements customers.  Generating

          units were not built for the purpose of entering into these

          arrangements.  Therefore, because utilities did not incur costs

          on behalf of non-requirements firm power sales customers, such

          customers have not caused costs to be stranded and should not be

          required to pay stranded cost charges.  Accordingly, we reaffirm

          limiting the opportunity for stranded cost recovery to costs

          associated with wholesale requirements contracts. 536/

               We clarify, however, that a contract may meet our definition
               of wholesale requirements contract even though it does not
               carry the label "requirements contract."  The definition
               refers to a contract that provides any portion of a
               customer's bundled wholesale power requirements.  As
               discussed above, whether or not a contract meets this
               definition hinges upon whether the customer depended upon
               the wholesale supplier for all or part of its power because
               it could not obtain transmission access to reach other
               suppliers, i.e., it was captive to the historical local
               supplier.





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -250-
            and RM94-7-002

               We recognize PA Munis' concern that if a utility meets the

          evidentiary requirements of the Rule and is allowed to recover

          stranded costs from wholesale requirements customers, such

          customers may see little or no savings in the short-term by

          switching power suppliers, since a stranded cost charge (in the

          form of either an exit fee or a surcharge on transmission) would

          be paid in addition to the power price paid a new supplier. 

          However, as we discuss above and in Section IV.J.2 below, we

          believe that stranded costs are transition costs that must be

          addressed at an early stage if we are to fulfill our regulatory

          responsibilities in moving to competitive markets.  Further, as

          we explain in Section IV.J.3 below, although spreading the costs

          to all transmission users of a utility's system (rather than

          imposing them directly on the departing wholesale requirements

          customer) might enable the customer to see earlier power cost

          savings than would result if stranded costs were directly

          assigned to the customer, we have concluded that this potential

          benefit to a broad-based approach is outweighed by a significant

          countervailing disadvantage -- namely, the violation of the cost-

          causation principle of ratemaking.  The Commission rejects a

          broad-based approach for the electric industry primarily because 

          the potential power cost savings to the departing generation

          customer would be realized only by shifting costs that are

          directly attributable to the departing generation customer to the

          other users of the utility's transmission system.





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -251-
            and RM94-7-002

               Contrary to PA Munis's claim, we believe that the

          circumstances surrounding the opportunity to seek stranded cost

          recovery from wholesale requirements customers that is permitted

          in Order No. 888 are distinguishable from the issues that were

          before the court in the Maryland People's Counsel cases.  Those

          cases involved challenges to Commission orders that permitted

          pipelines to transport gas at lowered prices to "non-captive

          consumers" (large industrial end users capable of switching to

          alternative fuels) without any obligation to provide the same

          service to "captive consumers" such as local distribution

          companies and their residential customers.  In Maryland People's

          Counsel I, the court invalidated the Commission's authorization

          of a "special marketing program" under which a pipeline and its

          producer would agree to amend their high-priced gas purchase

          contract to permit the producer to sell the committed gas

          elsewhere at market prices and to credit the volume of such sales

          against the pipeline's high-priced purchase obligations. 

          Eligibility to purchase the cheaper released gas was limited to

          industrial users.  The court found that the Commission had failed

          to provide a reasonable basis for its decision to exclude

          "captive customers" from eligibility to purchase the cheaper

          released gas. 537/  In Maryland People's Counsel II, the court

          invalidated the Commission's approval of blanket authority for

          interstate transportation of natural gas sold directly by



               See 761 F.2d 768.





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -252-
            and RM94-7-002

          producers to fuel-switchable end users.  The court held that the

          Commission had failed to consider the anticompetitive effects of

          failing to require the pipelines to provide the same service to

          captive consumers on nondiscriminatory terms. 538/

               In contrast to the Maryland People's Counsel cases, the

          Commission in Order No. 888 is not discounting services for one

          class of customers to the exclusion of another, nor is it

          ordering that public utilities provide transmission access to

          only a specified customer group.  To the contrary, Order No. 888

          requires all public utilities that own, control or operate

          facilities used for transmitting electric energy in interstate

          commerce to provide open access transmission to any "eligible

          customer," with "eligible customer" defined broadly to include

          "any electric utility (including the Transmission Provider and

          any power marketer), Federal power marketing agency, or any

          person generating electric energy for sale for resale." 539/ 

          Among other things, Order No. 888 gives wholesale requirements

          customers that previously were captive customers of their public

          utility suppliers the opportunity at the expiration of their

          contracts to take unbundled transmission service from their

          former suppliers in order to reach new suppliers.  At the same

          time, the Commission recognizes that the departure of a wholesale

          requirements customer in this circumstance may strand costs that

          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -253-
            and RM94-7-002

          the former supplying utility incurred based on a reasonable

          expectation that it would continue to serve the customer beyond

          the contract term.  As a result, Order No. 888 gives the former

          supplying utility the opportunity to seek recovery of costs

          stranded by the wholesale requirements customer's departure.

               In further contrast to the Maryland People's Counsel cases,

          the Commission addresses in this Order (above) PA Munis' claim

          that it is inequitable and anticompetitive that only wholesale

          requirements customers and not other wholesale customers are

          subject to the stranded cost provisions of Order No. 888.  The

          Commission has explained in detail the rationale for its decision

          that public utilities should be allowed an opportunity to seek to

          recover the stranded costs covered by this Rule only from

          wholesale requirements customers.  The Commission has also

          addressed in Section IV.J.2 below the concerns expressed by some

          as to the potential anticompetitive effect of stranded cost

          charges.  

               Rehearing Request -- ERCOT





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -254-
            and RM94-7-002

               The TX Com 540/ asks the Commission to clarify that ERCOT

          utilities may not use a section 211 proceeding as a vehicle to

          obtain wholesale or retail stranded cost recovery. 541/  It notes

          that based on the definitions in section 35.26 of "wholesale

          stranded cost" 542/ and "wholesale transmission service," 543/


               TX Com's request for rehearing was filed out-of-time on May
               29, 1996 with a request that the Commission accept the
               rehearing request for filing as of May 24, 1996.  TX Com
               explains it had made arrangements with a courier company to
               pick up its rehearing request on May 23, 1996 and deliver
               and file the rehearing request with the Commission before 5
               p.m. on May 24, 1996.  TX Com states that the courier
               company failed to pick up the rehearing request on May 23 as
               previously arranged.  TX Com says that when it became aware
               on May 24 that its rehearing request was not enroute to the
               Commission, it faxed a copy of the rehearing request to a
               copier and delivery service in Washington, D.C.  The
               pleading, which was not signed, was delivered to the
               Commission prior to 5 p.m. on May 24.  TX Com states that
               Commission personnel rejected the filing apparently because
               it was not signed.  TX Com asks that the Commission find
               good cause under Rule 2001 of the Commission's Rules of
               Practice and Procedures, 18 CFR 385.2001 (1996), to accept
               its rehearing request for filing as of May 24, 1996.  Under
               the circumstances, we will accept the rehearing request for
               filing as of May 24, 1996. 

               Texas Utilities Electric Company filed on June 21, 1996 a
               motion for leave to file and response to TX Com's rehearing
               request.  Texas Utilities opposes TX Com's positions on
               rehearing.  While answers to requests for rehearing
               generally are not permitted, 18 CFR 385.213(a)(2) (1996), we
               will depart from our general rule because of the significant
               nature of this proceeding and will accept Texas Utilities'
               response.  

               "Wholesale stranded cost" is defined as "any legitimate,
               prudent and verifiable cost incurred by a public utility or
               a transmitting utility to provide service to:  (1) a
               wholesale requirements customer that subsequently becomes,
               in whole or in part, an unbundled wholesale transmission
               services customer of such public utility or transmitting
               utility; or (ii) a retail customer, or a newly created
               wholesale power sales customer, that subsequently becomes,
                                                             (continued...)





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -255-
            and RM94-7-002

          the Rule applies only to interstate service and does not apply to

          the intrastate service provided by the utilities within ERCOT,

          yet the Commission suggests that it might permit a utility in

          ERCOT to recover stranded costs in a section 211 proceeding. 

          Even if the Commission concludes that it has the authority to

          resolve stranded cost issues for ERCOT utilities, TX Com asks the

          Commission to establish a preference for resolution of

          transmission and stranded cost issues in ERCOT by TX Com.  It

          suggests that uncertainty and gaming as to the choice of a forum

          could be avoided by executing a Memorandum of Understanding

          between TX Com and the Commission that would require interested

          persons to submit disputes to TX Com.  Further, to the extent

          that the new ERCOT transmission access rules adopted by the TX

          Com may be deemed as the cause of stranded costs in ERCOT, TX Com

          asserts that it should be allowed to resolve issues related to

          such stranded costs.

          and 212 of the FPA clearly give the Commission jurisdiction to

          order transmission services within ERCOT, subject to the special

          rate provision for ERCOT utilities in section 212(k). 545/  The

          Commission indicated that if it issues a final order in that case

          setting rates for transmission services within ERCOT, it will

          comply with section 212(k) and give deference to the TX Com's

          ratemaking methodology insofar as practicable and consistent with

          section 212(a).

               Our jurisdiction to order transmission services within ERCOT

          includes the authority to address costs that are stranded by a

          section 211 transmission order. 546/  Consistent with the special

          rate provision in section 212(k), we clarify that we will give

          deference to the TX Com's ratemaking methodology, including any



               Section 212(k), added by EPAct, provides as follows:
                    (1) RATES. - Any order under section 211
                    requiring provision of transmission services
                    in whole or in part within ERCOT shall
                    provide that any ERCOT utility which is not a
                    public utility and the transmission
                    facilities of which are actually used for
                    such transmission service is entitled to
                    receive compensation based, insofar as
                    practicable and consistent with subsection
                    (a), on the transmission ratemaking
                    methodology of the Public Utility Commission

               To clarify that the Order No. 888 stranded cost provisions
               apply to the intrastate utilities within ERCOT, solely in
               the context of a section 211 proceeding, we will revise the
               definition of "wholesale transmission services" in section
               35.26(b)(3) to read:  "Wholesale transmission services means
               the transmission of electric energy sold, or to be sold, at
               wholesale in interstate commerce or ordered pursuant to
               section 211 of the Federal Power Act (FPA)."

          provisions or procedures related to stranded cost recovery,

          insofar as it is practicable and consistent with section 212(a)

                         547/

               In Order No. 888, the Commission explained why it does not

          interpret the Cajun court decision as barring the recovery of

          stranded costs and why the record developed in this generic

          proceeding fully addresses the court's concerns regarding

          meaningful access to alternative suppliers. 548/

               We also addressed the court's concern that the method of

          recovery in that case (a charge in the departing customer's

          transmission rate) might constitute an anticompetitive tying

          arrangement.  We explained that the stranded cost recovery

          procedure we prescribe in the Open Access Rule is only a

          transitional mechanism that is intended to enable utilities to

          recover costs prudently incurred under a different regulatory

          regime.  The purpose and effect of the stranded cost recovery

          mechanism that we approved in the Rule is to facilitate the

          transition to competitive wholesale power markets.  We concluded

          that while stranded cost recovery may temporarily delay some of

          the benefits of competitive bulk power markets for some

          customers, such transition costs must be addressed at an early

          moving to competitive markets.

               In reaching these conclusions, the Commission applied the

          traditional regulatory concept of cost causation.  We stated that

          it is not an illegal tying arrangement to hold a customer

          accountable for the cost consequence of leaving an incumbent

          supplier if, under our rules, the incumbent supplier must show a

          reasonable expectation of providing continuing service to that

          customer before it can recover stranded costs from the customer.

               In addition, in response to the Cajun court and commenters

          in this proceeding as to the need to provide as much certainty as

          possible for departing customers concerning their potential

          stranded cost obligation, the Commission included a formula for

          calculating a departing customer's potential stranded cost

          obligation.  We explained that the revenues lost formula is

          designed to provide certainty for departing customers and to

          create incentives for the parties to address stranded cost claims

          between themselves without resort to litigation. 

               Rehearing Requests Arguing that the Commission Has Not
               Resolved the Cajun Court's Concerns

               Several entities submit that the Commission has not resolved

          the Cajun court's tying concerns.  They argue that tying

          arrangements are still the essence of the stranded cost recovery

          method mandated by Order No. 888, and that a tying arrangement is

          a per se antitrust violation that is not subject to justification

          by reference to the reasons for the restraint or the expected

          ancillary benefits. 549/  A number of these entities object that

          the Commission does not address the court's substantive concern

          that a stranded cost provision is the antithesis of competition.

          550/  Several object that the Commission brushes aside the

          acknowledged anticompetitive effects of the rule as being

          "transitional only," suggesting that short-term anticompetitive

          impacts are acceptable as long as the Commission is doing

          something that will be good for customers in the long term. 551/ 

          They also contend that the anticompetitive effects would not be

          limited to a transitional period, or that the transitional period

          could last indefinitely, thereby diluting or even nullifying the

          benefits of competition for years to come. 552/

               Several entities submit that the Commission erred in

          concluding that the stranded cost rules contained in Order No.

          888 would allow customers "meaningful" access to alternative

          power suppliers. 553/  Among other things, these entities contend

          that there is no showing in the Order that transmission providers

          will not continue to exercise monopoly power over their

          be stifled by the stranded cost recovery mechanism.

               Some entities also object that the stranded cost procedures

          contained in Order No. 888 fail to provide certainty in the

          computation of recoverable stranded costs.  They argue that the

          prospect of stranded cost liability and related litigation add

          costs of potential deal-killing magnitude to any power supply

          acquisition considered by a customer. 554/

               APPA and ELCON challenge the Commission's description of

          Western Resources, Inc. v. FERC 555/ as affirming the

          Commission's ability to allow stranded cost recovery.  APPA

          argues that Western Resources does not justify the stranded cost

          provisions of Order No. 888 because it was a filed rate doctrine

          case, not a stranded cost case.  APPA says that Western Resources

          involved no consideration of any allegation of anticompetitive

          conduct and no allegation that the utilities' proposal

          constituted an illegal tying arrangement.

               Commission Conclusion

               We will deny the requests for rehearing advanced on the

          basis of the Cajun case.  We disagree with those entities that

          contend that the Commission has not resolved the Cajun court's

          tying concerns.  As an initial matter, we note that the parties

          that have raised this issue on rehearing ignore the fact that

          while this Commission has a responsibility to consider the

          anticompetitive effects of regulated aspects of interstate

          utility operations, 556/ it has other statutory and regulatory

          public interest considerations which it must balance in order to

          engage in reasoned decisionmaking.  In this proceeding, we have

          carefully balanced our responsibilities to remedy undue

          discrimination and to consider anticompetitive effects, our goal

          to eliminate market power of utilities and anticompetitive

          effects in the long-run, and the need to provide a transition to

          competitive markets that is fair, that maintains a stable

          electric utility industry, and that recognizes the obligations

          incurred in a past, non-competitive regulatory regime.  As

          discussed below, we do not believe that the stranded cost

          proposal adopted in the Rule results in an illegal tying

          arrangement, as argued on rehearing.  We believe we have given

          reasoned consideration to any potential transitory

          anticompetitive effects of our stranded cost policy and that we

          have met the directives of the court in Cajun.





               The Commission's power under the FPA carries with it the
               responsibility to consider, in appropriate circumstances,
               the anticompetitive effects of regulated aspects of
               interstate operations pursuant to sections 202 and 203, and

               (1973).  While the Commission lacks principal responsibility
               for implementing antitrust policy, it retains an obligation
               to give reasoned consideration to the bearing of antitrust
               policy on matters within its jurisdiction.  Alabama Power
               Company, et al. v. FPC, 511 F.2d 383 (D.C. Cir. 1974).





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -262-
            and RM94-7-002

               In considering the Cajun decision, it is important to note

          that the Cajun court assumes the presence of a competitive market

          in the electric utility industry, but such a competitive market

          does not now exist.  Instead, the Commission is in the process of

          trying to bring about a competitive market and to manage the

          transition thereto. 557/  When the Commission undertook a similar

          restructuring in the gas industry, the D.C. Circuit invalidated

          the Commission's efforts precisely because the Commission had

          failed to deal with the stranded cost problem in a satisfactory

          manner. 558/ 

               As we indicated in Order No. 888, we do not believe it is an

          illegal tying arrangement to hold a customer accountable for the

          consequences of leaving an incumbent supplier if, before the

          incumbent supplier can recover legitimate, prudent and verifiable

          stranded costs from the departing customer, it must show that it

          incurred costs to provide service to the customer based on a

          reasonable expectation of continuing to serve the customer. 

          Order No. 888 provides no guarantee of stranded cost recovery. 

          Moreover, Order No. 888 provides the opportunity to recover

          stranded costs only for a discrete set of wholesale requirements

          contracts -- those executed on or before July 11, 1994 that do



               In contrast to the situation in Order No. 888, the Cajun
               court did not have before it a generic, Commission-imposed
               recovery mechanism for distinguishing stranded costs
               associated with the Commission's ordering of industry-wide
               open access from all uneconomic costs.

               See AGD, 824 F.2d at 1021.





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -263-
            and RM94-7-002

          not contain an exit fee or other explicit stranded cost provision

          -- and for retail-turned-wholesale customers.  Thus, it is not

          necessarily the case that customers will have to pay stranded

          costs when they leave their current suppliers.  To the contrary,

          before a utility can recover stranded costs from a customer, the

          utility must overcome certain evidentiary hurdles (including a

          rebuttable presumption of no reasonable expectation of continuing

          service if the contract contains a notice of termination

          provision).  Particularly given the narrowly tailored

          circumstances under which stranded cost recovery is permissible

          under the Rule, we do not view it as the antithesis of

          competition.

               We dismiss as misplaced the claims that Order No. 888's

          stranded cost recovery mechanism is a tying arrangement that is a

          per se antitrust violation that cannot be justified by reference

          to the reasons for the restraint or the expected ancillary

          benefits.  Any "tying" that might result from the Rule is by

          regulatory order, not through monopoly power, and is justified as

          a means to avoid unfair cost shifting and to achieve the pro-

          competitive benefits of the Rule.  As we stated in Order No. 888,

          the purpose and effect of the stranded cost recovery mechanism

          that we approve are to facilitate the transition to competitive

          wholesale power markets, not to prevent a generation customer of





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -264-
            and RM94-7-002

          a utility from being able to reach alternative suppliers through

          its former supplier's transmission. 559/

               To be sure, imposing a stranded cost charge might, in the

          short run, make some customers indifferent to whether they stay

          with their current suppliers and avoid stranded costs, or go with

          new suppliers but pay stranded costs to the former suppliers.

          560/  There is no question that, without the stranded cost

          recovery mechanism, some customers would be far more likely to

          switch to lower-cost suppliers and enjoy sooner the benefits of a

          competitive power market.  But, as detailed in Order No. 888,

          such an approach may result in higher costs for other customers. 

          We thus have had to balance the potential for earlier benefits

          for some customers against other public interest considerations,

          most particularly the need to provide a fair mechanism by which

          utilities can recover the costs of past investments under

               504 U.S. at 486-87 (Scalia, J. dissenting) ("Per se rules of
               antitrust illegality are reserved for those situations where
               logic and experience show that the risk of injury to
               competition from the defendant's behavior is so pronounced
               that it is needless and wasteful to conduct the usual
               judicial inquiry into the balance between the behavior's
               procompetitive benefits and its anticompetitive costs.").

               In effect, we recognize that we may have to endure some
               short-term delay in the transition from monopoly suppliers
               to competitive suppliers.  However, this is not
               anticompetitive; it is a necessary part of a scheme that is
               procompetitive overall.  See American Gas Association v.
               FERC, 888 F.2d 136, 149 (D.C. Cir. 1989) ("If conditioning
               access is a necessary part of a scheme that is
               procompetitive overall, however, then it does not violate
               the NGPA [Natural Gas Policy Act] even if it may seem to be
               anticompetitive when viewed in isolation.").





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -265-

          traditional regulatory concepts of prudently incurred costs and

          cost causation.  The result is not to deny competitive

          advantages, but only to delay their full realization for some

          customers.

               In any event, we do not believe that the Commission-imposed

          mechanism of allowing the utility to recover stranded costs from

          the departing customer through its transmission rates falls

          within the category of an illegal tying arrangement under the

          antitrust laws.  As the Supreme Court has defined it, "[a] tying

          arrangement is 'an agreement by a party to sell one product but

          only on the condition that the buyer also purchases a different

          (or tied) product, or at least agrees that he will not purchase

          that product from any other supplier.'" 561/

               Here there is no "tying" of "products." 562/  Instead, the

          Rule provides a mechanism for recovering costs associated with a

          prior contract.  We have not adopted a rule under which a

          customer may purchase transmission from a utility only on the

          condition that the customer also purchases a different product,

          namely, power, from the utility. 563/  To the contrary, the


               Eastman Kodak Company v. Image Technical Services, 504 U.S.
               451, 461 (1992).

               A "service" can constitute a "product" for purposes of a
               tying analysis.  See Eastman Kodak Company v. Image
               Technical Services, Inc., 504 U.S. at 462.

               The Rule requires all transmission customers to purchase at
               least some reactive supply and voltage control service from
               the transmission provider.  However, the Commission found
               that the cost of such services is "part of the cost of basic
                                                             (continued...)





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -266-
            and RM94-7-002

          Commission, through the Order No. 888 open access transmission

          requirement, is attempting to provide the customer with the

          opportunity to obtain unbundled transmission from a former

          supplying utility as a means to reach a new generation supplier. 

          Whatever else, the stranded costs are not charges for "products"

          and thus there is no "tying" in the conventional sense.  At best,

          there is only a condition:  in obtaining unbundled transmission,

          the customer must also pay appropriate costs stranded by its use

          of Commission-required transmission access.  

               Finally, it is not clear how often departing customers will

          be obligated to pay stranded costs.  Stranded cost recovery is by

          no means guaranteed under the Rule, nor is it clear what portion

          of a utility's uneconomic investment will be recoverable as

          stranded costs.  Even when a utility is able to meet the

          evidentiary standard and the Commission approves imposition of a

          stranded cost charge, the customer is free to pay off its

          obligation immediately.  If it chooses to pay off the stranded

          cost obligation over time, that charge would not be imposed

          indefinitely on the customer.  We have limited the scope of

          contracts and costs for which utilities may seek stranded cost

          recovery.  This limitation -- to certain contracts and

          demonstrated costs -- in our judgment fairly allocates between

          utility and customer the burdens and benefits of open access

          transmission.

               Nor is it true that the Rule does not allow customers

          "meaningful" access to alternative power suppliers.  The Final

          Rule pro forma tariff contains terms and conditions ensuring the

          provision of non-discriminatory transmission service.  The

          requirements that a public utility take service under its own

          tariff for wholesale sales and purchases, adopt a non-

          discriminatory transmission information network, and separate

          power marketing and transmission functions further ensure non-

          discrimination and remove constraints to fair competition.  The

          result is meaningful access to alternative suppliers that goes

          far beyond what was offered in the transmission tariff under

          review in Cajun.

               Contrary to the claims of some, the Open Access Rule does

          not guarantee that a utility may sell its power at market-based

          rates.  The open access compliance tariff required by Order No.

          Commission's Rule does not generically grant market-based rate

          authority to utilities that file compliance tariffs.  Utilities

          must still demonstrate on a case-by-case basis that they not only




               Such tariff is a condition, but not the sole condition, for
               market-based rates.  See, e.g., Delmarva Power & Light

               Notwithstanding the objections by some commenters that the

          stranded cost procedures of Order No. 888 fail to provide

          certainty in the computation of stranded cost charges, we believe

          that directly assigning stranded costs to departing generation

          customers using the revenues lost formula is the fairest and most

          efficient way to balance the competing interests of those

          involved.  The alternatives that we considered (an up-front

          broad-based approach or an as-realized broad-based approach) have

          significant disadvantages and are extensively discussed in Order

          No. 888. 566/  Following a careful evaluation of the

          alternatives, we concluded that a revenues lost formula to

          calculate a customer's stranded cost obligation is more

          reasonable and provides greater certainty than would other

          approaches, such as those that rely on broad-based surcharge

          schemes that impose costs that may never be incurred or those






               A seller requesting market-based rates is not required to
               demonstrate any lack of generation market power with respect
               to sales from capacity for which construction commenced on
               or after the effective date (July 9, 1996) of the Rule.  18
               CFR 35.27(a).  However, if specific evidence is presented by
               an intervenor that a seller requesting market-based rates
               for sales from new generating capacity nevertheless has
               generation dominance, the Commission will evaluate whether
               the seller has generation dominance with respect to the new
               capacity.  FERC Stats. & Regs. at 31,657; mimeo at 65-66.

          that result in widely fluctuating transmission rates. 567/  As we

          stated in Order No. 888, while we recognize that some commenters

          oppose the revenues lost approach as imprecise, any ratemaking

          method that relies on estimates will be subject to forecasting

          error. 568/  Nevertheless, we have gone to great lengths to

          provide specificity with respect to the calculation of the

          components of the formula.  

               In response to those commenters that argue that Order No.

          888's stranded cost procedures will add costs of potential deal-

          killing magnitude to any power supply acquisition considered by a

          customer, we believe that, to the contrary, use of the formula

          will narrow the scope of disputes over the calculation of

          stranded costs, lend precision to the stranded cost amount it

          produces, and provide certainty to departing generation customers

          with respect to their stranded cost obligations.

          Western Resources as a case affirming the Commission's ability to

          allow stranded cost recovery.  Notwithstanding their efforts to



               Under the revenues lost approach, a customer's stranded cost
               obligation is calculated by subtracting the competitive
               market value of the power the customer would have purchased
               (on an average annual basis) from the average annual
               revenues that the customer would have paid had it remained
               on the utility's generation system, and multiplying the
               result by the period of time the utility reasonably could
               have expected to serve the customer beyond the contract
               termination but for the open access required under Order No.

          the transition of the natural gas industry to a competitive

          market and supports the Commission's ability to allow stranded

          cost recovery in general.  The same court, in United Distribution

          Companies, has recently confirmed the Commission's ability to

          allow the recovery of costs stranded in the transition to

          competitive markets, limiting its concerns to issues about "how"

               to demonstrate that it reasonably expected to continue
               serving the customer beyond the term of the contract),

            and RM94-7-002

          surcharge on transmission is the appropriate method for recovery

          of such costs.  We concluded that the departing generation

          customer (and not the remaining generation or transmission

          customers or shareholders) should bear the legitimate and prudent

          obligations that the utility undertook on that customer's behalf. 

          In reaching this decision, we carefully weighed the arguments

          supporting direct assignment of stranded costs against those

          supporting the broad-based approach of spreading stranded costs

          to all transmission users of a utility's system.  After a

          detailed review of the advantages and disadvantages of each

          approach, we concluded that, on balance, direct assignment is the

          preferable approach for both legal and policy reasons. 572/  Our

          primary considerations were that direct assignment is consistent

          with the well-established principle that the one who has caused a

          cost to be incurred should pay that cost and that it will result

          in a more accurate determination of a utility's stranded costs

          than would an up-front, broad-based transmission surcharge.

               The Commission also acknowledged that the direct assignment

          approach adopted in Order No. 888 is different from the approach

          taken for the natural gas industry.  We explained why we believe

          that difference to be justified by pointing out a number of

          differences between the transition of the electric industry to an

          of stranded costs.  IL Industrials submits that the statement in

          the Rule that utility shareholders "'had no responsibility for

          causing the legitimate, prudent and verifiable costs to be

          incurred'" is untrue. 576/  It argues that although utilities may

          have had a legal obligation to serve and meet projected demands,

          how the utility chose to meet those obligations was under the

          utility's control.  IL Industrials asserts that shareholders

          should bear some of the risk associated with the decisions of

          their management that were less than optimal.  At a minimum, IL

          Industrials argues that the Commission should consider on a case-

          by-case basis (when it determines whether a utility has incurred

          legitimate and verifiable stranded costs) whether some amount of

          stranded costs should be shared with shareholders.

          risks and who have been compensated for those risks through rates

          of return.

               A number of parties object that the Commission, in declining

          to require some shareholder sharing of stranded costs, is

          allowing the electric utility industry to claim more generous

          recoveries under Order No. 888 than it allowed the gas industry,

          and that it has provided no adequate rationale for this

          difference in treatment. 580/  San Francisco states that although

          beneficiaries of open access, to share in the costs of the

          transition. 582/  Central Illinois Light states that the

          Commission should allow partial recovery of stranded costs and

               Occidental Chemical argues that requiring gas customers to
               choose their suppliers during an open season enabled the
               pipelines to place a dollar value on their take-or-pay
               obligations.  Shippers thus knew at the outset what their
               gas supply realignment (GSR) surcharge would be and could
               negotiate with other suppliers accordingly.  Occidental
               Chemical says that most pipelines have already recouped
               their GSR costs and have made the transition to a
               competitive supply market in under three years.  It argues
          that, on the other hand, allowing electric stranded costs to be
          recovered over an indefinite period will blunt the pro-
          competitive effect of Order No. 888.

               Central Illinois Light supports a recovery mechanism that
               would allow utilities to allocate stranded costs to
               requirements customers on a demand basis and to all
               transmission customers on a commodity basis.  It argues that

               Occidental Chemical also objects that the Commission failed

          to address the merits of its suggestion that the Commission grant

          a utility a presumption of prudence in return for absorbing a

          percentage of its stranded costs.

               ELCON, in a supplement to its rehearing request, 584/

          submits that the D.C. Circuit's remand in United Distribution

          Companies of the aspect of Order No. 636 that allocated 100

          percent of gas supply realignment costs to customers and none to

          pipelines has implications for the Commission's decision in Order

          No. 888 to allocate 100 percent of stranded costs to departing

          customers without any shareholder sharing of the costs.  ELCON

          suggests that although the D.C. Circuit indicated that a finding

          of threat to the financial viability of the pipeline sector might

          justify such allocation, there is no evidence in the record in

          the Order No. 888 proceeding, and the Commission has made no

          finding, that wholesale stranded cost recovery jeopardizes the

          financial viability of the utility sector.  It adds that, to the

               Commission Conclusion

               As we explained in Order No. 888, we decided not to require

          a utility meeting the requirements for stranded cost recovery to

          shoulder a portion of its stranded costs because such a

          requirement would be a major deviation from the traditional

          principle that a utility should have a reasonable opportunity to

          recover its prudently incurred costs. 585/  Our decision (which

          allows assignment of legitimate, prudent and verifiable stranded

          costs to departing requirements generation customers, not to

          shareholders or other customers of the utility) also follows the

          cost causation principle that has been fundamental to our

          regulation since 1935. 586/  It is important, in this regard, to

               In response to ELCON's argument that it is not clear how
               departing wholesale customers who signed contracts in 1985
               could have "caused" utilities to incur uneconomic assets
               such as expensive nuclear facilities that were planned and
               ordered in the 1970s, we note that customers taking
          requirements service generally pay an allocated share of total
          embedded costs, including the cost of investments made before the
          customer began service.  This pricing principle is consistent
          with the method that Order No. 888 adopts for calculating a
          departing customer's stranded cost obligation.  The revenues lost
          approach is not an asset-by-asset approach.  Instead, it is an
          approach that looks at a utility's current rates, which are based
          on all the utility's assets, which may include both high cost and
          low cost generating facilities of various ages, and relies on the
          presumption that the fixed costs allocated to departing customers
          under their current rates are properly assignable to them.  Thus,
          if a utility is able to demonstrate that it had a reasonable
          expectation of continuing to serve the customer after the
          contract term, the customer's stranded cost obligation would be
                                                             (continued...)





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -278-
            and RM94-7-002

          distinguish between assuring recovery of all uneconomic costs

          (which Order No. 888 does not do) and providing an opportunity

          for recovery where the evidentiary requirements of the Rule are

          met.

               Allowing full recovery of stranded costs under Order No. 888

          is not equivalent to allowing 100 percent recovery of the costs

          of all uneconomic assets.  A utility may have uneconomic assets

          for a variety of reasons, including a decline in load, customer

          shifts to natural gas, customer energy conservation, loss of a

          large industrial customer, customer self-generation, and a

          customer gaining transmission access through another utility's

          transmission system.  The Rule does not provide for the recovery

          of the costs of such uneconomic assets.

               Instead, the Rule defines a discrete set of uneconomic costs

          that are stranded by FPA section 211 or Order No. 888

          transmission service (when a customer uses the former supplying

          utility's transmission system to reach a new supplier) for which

          utilities may seek recovery.  However, even as to this set of

          costs the Rule does not guarantee 100 percent recovery.  To be

          eligible to recover such costs, a utility must satisfy the



          (...continued)
          computed based on the average annual revenues that the customer
          would have paid had it remained a customer of the utility; the
          calculation of stranded costs would not be tied to any particular
          investments that the utility made in a particular unit.  As we
          explain in Section IV.J.9 below, the use of present annual
          revenues as the basis for the stranded cost calculation is based,
          among other things, on the presumption that present rates include
          all just and reasonable costs of providing service. 





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -279-
            and RM94-7-002

          reasonable expectation test set forth in Order No. 888.  Even

          then, the utility will be eligible to recover only costs that are

          legitimate, prudent and verifiable. 

               In response to those entities that argue that departing

          customers are not the sole cause of stranded costs and that poor

          management decisions may be partly to blame, we reiterate that a

          determination that a utility has a reasonable expectation of

          continuing to serve a customer would not, in all circumstances,

          mean that costs incurred by the utility were prudent.  As we said

          in Order No. 888, we cannot make a blanket assumption that all

          claimed stranded costs were prudently incurred.  We explained

          that prudence of costs, depending upon the facts in a specific

          case, may include different things, such as prudence in operation

          and maintenance of a plant, and the utility's ongoing obligation

          to exercise prudence in retaining existing investments and power

          purchase contracts and in entering into new ones. 587/  We

          clarified, however, that we do not intend to relitigate the

          prudence of costs previously recovered.

               Thus, to the extent that costs have not been previously

          recovered by a utility, and depending upon the facts presented, a

          customer from whom a utility is seeking to recover stranded costs

          may be able to challenge the prudence of those costs.  If such

          prudence challenge is successful, then the utility would not be

          entitled to recovery of the imprudently incurred costs, through

          stranded cost recovery or otherwise.  We believe that this fully

          addresses the concerns of those entities that contend that

          departing customers should not be responsible for costs that

          result from poor management decisions or other actions by the

          utility. 588/

               As we explained in Order No. 888, our decision not to

          require utilities to shoulder a portion of their stranded costs

          is based on the traditional principle that a utility should have

          a reasonable opportunity to recover its prudently incurred costs.

          589/  NASUCA's reliance on the Commission's cancelled plant

          policy to support its argument that full recovery of uneconomic

          investment is not the norm is misplaced.  The Commission's

          cancelled plant policy, which allows a utility to recover 50

          percent of its prudently-incurred investment in a cancelled or

          abandoned plant, relates only to plants that are cancelled or

          abandoned prior to entering commercial service and thus prior to



               Whether poor management decisions or other actions are
               imprudent would be decided on a case-by-case basis.  See,

          different approach in the case of electric generating plants that

          are prematurely shut down after having been in commercial

          operation for a number of years.  In the latter instance (which

          more closely resembles the type of costs for which a utility

          might seek recovery under Order No. 888 than does the cancelled

          plant before operation scenario), the Commission has allowed 100

          percent recovery of prudently-incurred unamortized investment.

          had been in operation for over 30 years.  In affirming the
          Commission's decision to allow full recovery and not to apply
          Opinion No. 295's recovery rule for plants abandoned before
          operation, the court explained: 

                    Although ratepayers generally 'bear the expense of
                    depreciation' and although investors generally 'are
                    entitled to recoup from consumers the full amount of
                    their investment in depreciable assets devoted to
                    public service,' [citations omitted] Opinion No. 295
                    makes a logical exception to this full recovery rule
                    for plants abandoned before operation; in such cases,
                    ratepayers have not benefitted from the plant.  The
                    situation here is quite different.  Because customers
                    have benefitted from the operation of the plant for
                    over 30 years, and because ceasing plant operations

               San Francisco's and NASUCA's reliance on Market Street is

          also distinguishable.  That case involved an industry (street

          railway) that had been rendered economically obsolete by market

          forces.  The electric industry today, in contrast, is clearly not

          obsolete.  Moreover, the costs that Order No. 888 gives a utility

          an opportunity to recover even in the face of market forces would

          not become stranded but for statutory and regulatory changes.

               A number of parties contend that the Commission has not

          provided an adequate rationale for its different treatment of

          shareholder sharing in the natural gas industry.  ELCON also

          relies on the D.C. Circuit's remand in United Distribution

          Companies of Order No. 636's holding that pipelines could recover

          100 percent of their gas supply realignment (GSR) costs.  After

          further review of this matter in light of the Court's decision in

          United Distribution Companies, we reaffirm that, even though the

          Commission permitted pipelines to recover take-or-pay costs based

          on "cost spreading" and "value of service" principles, stranded

          electric utility costs should be recovered based on traditional

          cost causation principles.  This is because, despite the fact

          that both sets of costs are incurred in connection with a



          (...continued)
          will benefit customers by lowering rates, such an exception is
          unwarranted.  Moreover, applying Opinion No. 295's recovery rule
          would not, as it would in the case of a plant that never began
          operations, promote economic efficiency."  80 F.3d at 532.

               In Yankee Atomic, the Commission also allowed recovery of
               100 percent of construction work in progress and of post-
               shutdown O&M expenditures.

          transition to unbundled, open access service, there are also

          substantial differences between the circumstances surrounding the

          two industries' incurrence of their respective transition costs.

               The pipelines' take-or-pay problems began before the

          Commission initiated open access transportation in Order No. 436. 

          The severe gas shortages of the 1970s led to enactment of the

          Natural Gas Policy Act (NGPA), which initiated a phased decontrol

          of most new gas prices and established ceiling prices for

          controlled gas, including incentive prices for price-controlled

          new gas higher than the ceiling prices previously established by

          the Commission under the NGA. 592/  To avoid future shortages,

          pipelines then entered into long-term take-or-pay contracts at

          the high prices made possible by the NGPA, and those high prices

          stimulated producers to greatly increase exploration and

          drilling. 593/  When demand unexpectedly fell and supply

          increased, the pipelines found themselves contractually bound to

          take or pay for high-priced gas which they could not sell.  Even

          before Order No. 436 issued in October 1985, pipeline take-or-pay

          exposure was approaching $10 billion. 594/  In 1986, as pipelines

          were just beginning to implement open access transportation under

          Order No. 436 and before the August 1987 issuance of Order No.

               The Commission and the industry had never previously faced a

          take-or-pay problem of this nature or magnitude.  In earlier

          times, pipelines had made take-or-pay payments to particular

          producers, and the Commission had a policy of permitting such

          payments to be included in rate base and then recovered as a gas

          cost when the pipeline later took the gas under make-up

          provisions in the contract. 596/  By 1983, however, the pipelines

          could not manage their take-or-pay problems, and stopped honoring

          the bulk of their take-or-pay liabilities. 597/  They then sought

          settlements with the producers to reform or terminate the

          uneconomic take-or-pay contracts and to resolve outstanding take-

          or-pay liabilities.  Because pipelines had never previously

          incurred significant take-or-pay settlement costs, the Commission

          had no policy concerning whether and how pipelines were to

          recover those costs.  The Commission commenced establishing such

               period January 1, 1983 through June 30, 1987 of over $24
          billion, they made take-or-pay payments totalling only $.7

          settlement costs had yet been included in pipelines' rates. 

          However, since the pipelines' outstanding take-or-pay liabilities

          were in the neighborhood of $10 billion, it was clear that

          pipelines would incur massive costs in their settlements with

          producers.

          how to allocate take-or-pay settlement costs in Order No. 500, it

          did so under the shadow of the pipelines' vast outstanding take-

          or-pay exposure.  The essential problem, therefore, was to decide

          which customers' rates should be raised to reflect the billions

          of dollars of take-or-pay settlement costs that the pipelines

          were incurring, but that the pipelines had still not filed to

          recover.  To have allocated those costs solely to any one segment

          of the industry would have imposed a crushing new burden on that

          segment.  For example, if the Commission had allocated the take-

          or-pay settlement costs entirely to bundled sales customers who

          chose to convert to transportation-only service, those customers

          would have ended up far worse off than if they remained as

          bundled sales customers.

               As a result of all these facts, the fundamental premise of

          Order No. 500 was, as the Court expressed it in KN Energy, that

          "the extraordinary nature of this problem requires the aid of the

          entire industry to solve it." 599/  In order to accomplish this

          result, Order No. 500 established an equitable sharing mechanism

          for pipelines to use in recovering their take-or-pay settlement

          costs as an alternative to recovery through their commodity sales

          rates.  Relying on "cost spreading" and "value of service"

          principles, the Commission permitted pipelines to allocate their

          take-or-pay settlement costs among all the pipelines' customers. 

          The Commission also required the pipelines using the equitable

          sharing mechanism to absorb a portion of the costs in return for

          the ability to recover an equal portion through a fixed charge. 

          Importantly, pipelines using the equitable sharing mechanism and

          agreeing to absorb a portion of the costs were given a

          presumption that their take-or-pay settlement costs were prudent. 

          Those who did not choose to avail themselves of the

          sharing/absorption mechanism could still file for recovery of

          take-or-pay costs pursuant to the traditional ratemaking

          methodology.  Because the pipelines' cash flow problems were so

          severe and they could not reasonably expect to recover their

          costs through their sales rates, they readily availed themselves

          of the special mechanism, with its presumption of prudence,

          rather than the more protracted traditional ratemaking option.

          spreading in connection with the allocation of take-or-pay costs

          among a pipeline's open access customers. 601/  The Court held

          that "the ratemaking rationales of Order No. 500 can be

          reconciled with the NGA, given the unusual circumstances

          surrounding the take-or-pay problem, and the limited nature --

          both in time and scope -- of the Commission's departure from the

          cost-causation principle." 602/  The Court emphasized that "[w]e

          hold only -- and quite narrowly -- that in the context of Order

          No. 500 the Commission has not betrayed its obligations to the

          NGA or precedent by employing these ratemaking principles in its

          attempt to bring closure to the take-or-pay drama." 603/

          existing requirements and transmission contracts between electric

          utilities and their customers, we have already pointed out:

                    At the time the Commission addressed this
                    situation in the natural gas industry, it was
                    faced with shrinking natural gas markets,
                    statutory escalations in natural gas prices
                    under the Natural Gas Policy Act, and
                    increased production of gas.  In other words,
                    there was a market failure in the industry. .
                    . . In contrast, there is no such market
                    failure in the electric industry. [604/]

               The electric utility costs potentially stranded by Order No.

          888 are fixed costs arising from the utility's electric

          generation business, including, for example, depreciation expense

          associated with the utilities' own generation facilities and a

          return on the original cost of its investment in those

          facilities.  They also include costs associated with mandatory QF

          purchase contracts.  Unlike take-or-pay settlement costs, these

          costs are not an extraordinary expense that the Commission has

          never previously encountered.  Rather, the stranded electric

          costs that are subject to the direct assignment provisions of

          Order No. 888 are ordinary costs that have always been, and are

          currently, included in the utility's rates for electric

          generation approved by the Commission.  And there is no pre-

          existing industry-wide market failure.  Thus, we are not

          confronted at the start of the electric open access program with

          a vast outstanding cost not currently reflected in the electric

          utilities' rates, as we were at the start of the natural gas open

          access program.

               Therefore, unlike the situation with the natural gas

          industry, stranded electric utility costs can be allocated among

          customers based upon traditional cost causation principles

          without imposing inequitable and unreasonable burdens on

          particular customer classes.  Direct assignment to departing

          requirements generation customers through the stranded cost

          recovery mechanism contained in the Rule is consistent with the

          traditional cost causation principle because it recognizes the

          link between the incurrence of stranded costs and the decision of

          a particular generation customer to use open access transmission

          on the utility's system to leave the utility's generation system

          and shop for power, and bases the utility's ability to recover

          stranded costs on its ability to demonstrate that it incurred

          costs with the reasonable expectation that the customer would

          remain on its generation system beyond the term of the contract. 

          The stranded costs are measured as the difference between

          revenues the utility would have recovered from the customer and

          the market value of the utility's power.

               In essence, therefore, all that the direct assignment

          provisions of Order No. 888 require is that certain customers

          (those whom a utility is able to demonstrate it reasonably

          expected to continue serving beyond the contract term) who

          convert to transmission-only service continue, for a period, to

          bear certain generation costs that they were previously bearing. 





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -290-
            and RM94-7-002

          This helps to minimize immediate cost shifts to the remaining

          generation customers, and is thus consistent with the Court's

          concerns in AGD about cost shifts due to open access

          transportation. 605/  At the same time, it does not impose any

          crushing new burden on the converting generation customers, as

          would have happened if in the natural gas industry the Commission

          had allocated the take-or-pay settlement costs entirely to

          pipeline sales customers who converted to transportation-only

          service. 

               On the issue of utility absorption of stranded costs, as

          ELCON points out, the D.C. Circuit in United Distribution

          Companies remanded Order No. 636 to the Commission for further

          explanation as to why the Commission had exempted pipelines from

          sharing in Order No. 636 GSR costs in light of:  (1) its reliance

          on "cost spreading" and "value of service" principles in

          allocating GSR costs among the pipelines' customers, and (2) the

          absorption requirement in Order Nos. 500/528.  As the Court

          explained:

                    If the Commission intends to assign GSR costs
                    according to these 'cost spreading' and
                    'value of service' principles, it must do so
                    consistently or explain the rationale for
                    proceeding in another manner.  We approved
                    the invocation of those principles in KN
                    Energy because FERC had concluded that the
                    take-or-pay crisis could be resolved only by
                    spreading costs throughout the 'entire
                    industry' 968 F.2d at 1301 (emphasis added),
                    and because we recognized that 'all segments



               See, e.g., AGD, 824 F.2d at 1026.





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -291-
            and RM94-7-002

                    of the industry' . . . will benefit, id.
                    (emphasis added), from restructuring. [606/] 

               For the reasons discussed above and in Order No. 888, we

          have chosen to use traditional cost causation principles both in

          allocating stranded electric costs to certain electric utility

          customers and in finding that the utilities should be given an

          opportunity for full recovery of certain legitimate, prudent, and

          verifiable stranded costs.  Thus, Order No. 888 does not present

          the issue of whether the Commission inconsistently applied

          ratemaking principles to the recovery of stranded costs that was

          of concern to the court in United Distribution Companies when it

          remanded the analogous portion of Order No. 636.

               Moreover, based on the facts summarized above, the

          Commission concludes that the rationale we used to support the

          Order Nos. 500/528 absorption requirement is not valid for

          electric utility costs stranded by Order No. 888.  Order No. 528-

          A, where the Commission gave its fullest justification for that

          absorption requirement, did not rely on either the "cost

          spreading" or "value of service" rationales to support the

          absorption requirement. 607/  Order Nos. 500/528 consistently

          recognized that the Commission must "provide a pipeline a

          reasonable opportunity to recover its prudently incurred costs."

          608/  However, Order No. 528-A reasoned that, because the take-

          or-pay problem was caused more by general market conditions than

          by any regulatory action of the Commission, it was appropriate to

          require the pipelines to share in the losses arising from those

          market conditions as a condition to using the alternative

          recovery mechanism. 609/

               In these circumstances, the Commission concludes that it

          would not be reasonable to require electric utilities to bear

          costs that, unlike the Order Nos. 500/528 take-or-pay costs,

          arise as the direct result of Congress' and the Commission's

          change in the regulatory regime through FPA section 211 and Order

          No. 888.  This is particularly the case since the electric

          utilities' potential stranded costs relate to large capital

          expenditures or long-term contractual commitments (some mandated

          by federal law) to buy power made many years ago in reliance on

          the preexisting regulatory regime.  

               Moreover, in a separate order, the Commission is responding

          to the United Distribution Companies remand by reaffirming the

          policy established in Order No. 636 that pipelines should be

          permitted full recovery of their prudently incurred GSR costs.

               pipelines to seek full recovery of their take-or-pay
               settlement costs through their sales commodity rates.  The
               Commission required pipelines to absorb a share of their
               Order No. 500/528 take-or-pay costs only if they chose to
               use the alternative, equitable sharing recovery mechanism.

          In that order, the Commission finds that the rationale Order No.

          528-A used to support the Order Nos. 500/528 absorption

          requirement is inapplicable to GSR costs.  The remand order

          explains that, in the face of extraordinary market conditions,

          Order Nos. 500/528 adopted extraordinary measures.  However, as

          we are finding here with respect to stranded electric utility

          costs, the remand order holds that the extraordinary market

          circumstances that gave rise to the requirement for pipeline

          absorption of gas supply costs in Order Nos. 500/528 were not

          present at the time of Order No. 636.  Even before the Commission

          initiated open access transportation in Order No. 436, the market

          was preventing pipelines from recovering costs incurred under

          their take-or-pay contracts.  The Order Nos. 500/528 absorption

          requirement reflected the preexisting effect of the market, which

          would have required absorption even without open access

          transportation under Order No. 436.  The remand order finds that,

          contrary to the situation when Order No. 436 issued, at the time

          of Order No. 636, pipelines were generally able to take gas under

          their few remaining high-priced take-or-pay contracts from the

          late 1970s and early 1980s and were no longer accumulating

          significant additional take-or-pay obligations.  This was because

          the pipelines were still performing a significant sales service

          and had reformed most of their uneconomic take-or-pay

          contracts. 610/

          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -294-
            and RM94-7-002

               The remand order accordingly holds that the Commission's

          regulatory actions in Order No. 636 have caused the pipelines to

          incur the GSR costs.  This is particularly the case because Order

          No. 636 required the pipelines to unbundle their natural gas and

          transportation sales and forbade the pipelines from making sales

          unless they were made by a separate sales or marketing entity. 

          Order No. 888 also requires generation or commodity sales to be

          unbundled from sales of transmission.  In these circumstances,

          traditional ratemaking principles require the Commission to allow

          the pipelines an opportunity to recover the full amount of the

          expenses caused by its actions.  Thus, the Commission's approach

          to Order No. 636 GSR costs is similar to its approach in Order

          No. 888 to stranded electric generation costs.

          Chemical) challenge the Commission's suggestion that, after Order
          No. 436, many of the former bundled sales customers of the
          pipeline had departed.  To the extent that Order No. 888
          suggested that many pipelines' sales customers had terminated
          their sales service before Order No. 636 issued, we note that, as
          the Commission indicated in Order No. 636, pipeline sales
          constituted less than 20 percent of total annual throughput on
          major pipelines.  FERC Stats. & Regs.  30,939 at 30,400. 
          However, the Commission also found that in 1991 over 60 percent
          of peak day capacity on major pipelines that made bundled sales
          was reserved for pipeline firm sales service.  Id. at 30,399. 
          Thus, we clarify that although on an annual basis customers were
          buying most of their gas from other suppliers, pipelines were

               Rehearing Requests Citing Other Inconsistencies Between
               Commission Treatments of the Gas and Electric Industries

               VT DPS and Valero submit that Order No. 888 does not

          satisfactorily distinguish the Commission's rejection of gas

          pipelines' attempts to impose exit fees on departing customers. 

          They argue that the Commission opposed the imposition of such

          exit fees in the gas context as anticompetitive because it would

          force customers desiring to switch suppliers when their contracts

          expired to pay the supply costs of both the new and former

          suppliers.      

               VT DPS and Valero take issue with the Commission's attempt

          to distinguish a recent El Paso case 611/ as a "post-

          restructuring" case under Order No. 636.  They contend that the

          Commission consistently applied the same policy (rejection of gas

          pipeline attempts to impose exit fees) before restructuring under

          Order No. 636.  They further claim that the Commission cannot

          articulate a plausible basis for permitting utilities with notice

          provisions to file for exit fees, having denied El Paso's

          proposal outright without giving it an opportunity to rebut the

          presumption.

               VT DPS and Valero also state that the "stranded" costs for

          which the Commission allowed recovery under Order No. 636 were

          costs that would be rendered unrecoverable because the costs

          would not be incurred to provide transportation service and

            and RM94-7-002

          because there would be no wholesale load from which to recover

          the costs.  They indicate that the Commission has held that such

          gas costs are stranded only if rendered unrecoverable as a direct

          result of the restructuring required under Order No. 636.  They

          submit that when a utility loses wholesale load or a municipality

          establishes a new distribution system and the utility cannot

          resell the capacity left unused, the utility's costs are not

          necessarily "stranded" -- i.e., rendered unrecoverable -- any

          more than if the utility's load declines because of conservation,

          an economic downturn or an increase in self-generation.  They

          argue that the Commission should limit utility stranded cost

          claims solely to those cases where the utility can demonstrate

          that its costs have been rendered unrecoverable as a direct

          result of the Rule.

               Commission Conclusion

               We explained in Order No. 888 why we disagree with the

          argument that the Commission cannot impose an exit fee to recover

          stranded costs because the Commission did not allow gas pipelines

          to do so.  We noted that the Rule establishes procedures for

          providing a potential departing generation customer advance

          notice (before it leaves its existing supplier) of the stranded

          cost charge (whether it is to be paid as an exit fee or a

          transmission surcharge) that will be applied if the customer

          decides to buy power elsewhere and the Commission decides the

          utility has satisfied the stranded cost recovery criteria of the

          Rule, e.g., the reasonable expectation criterion.  We indicated





          Docket Nos. RM95-8-001        -297-
            and RM94-7-002

          that in the natural gas context, in contrast, the Commission has

          prohibited pipelines from developing and charging an "exit fee"

          after a customer had implemented its gas purchase decision,

          noting that otherwise, the customer would not know in advance the

          full cost consequences of its nomination decision. 612/  

               We continue to believe that the Commission's decisions

          concerning natural gas pipeline exit fees, relied on by VT DPS

          and Valero, are not inconsistent with Order No. 888's limited

          approval of exit fees for the recovery of certain stranded

          electric utility costs.  VT DPS and Valero point first to two

          cases decided by the Commission in 1988 and 1989 involving Gas

          Inventory Charges (GICs) proposed by Transwestern Pipeline

          Company (Transwestern) 613/ and El Paso Natural Gas Company (El

          Paso) 614/ pursuant to our Order No. 500 policy statement. 

          However, those cases are not relevant here, essentially because

          the exit fees at issue in those cases were not designed to

          recover costs arising from the transition to open access

          transportation, unlike the stranded electric utility costs at

          issue here.

               In the Transwestern case cited by VT DPS and Valero,

          Transwestern included in its proposal to implement a GIC a



               FERC Stats. & Regs. at 31,802; mimeo at 489.

            and RM94-7-002

          request for permission to assess an exit fee.  The exit fee would

          have been charged to its largest local distribution company

          customer if that customer initially chose to nominate purchases

          under the GIC but then subsequently reduced its nominations.  The

          Commission found the proposed exit fee inconsistent with both (1)

          its policy that GIC customers know in advance the full cost

          consequences of their nomination decisions and (2) its objective

          that prices under the GIC be constrained by market forces.     

               However, this holding was not applicable to Transwestern's

          recovery of costs incurred as part of its transition to open

          access transportation, since the Commission did not intend the

          GIC as a vehicle for recovery of such transition costs.  The GIC

          was intended solely as a forward-looking charge that would

          recover costs the pipeline would incur in the future under its

          reformed, market responsive gas supply contracts. 615/  The

          Commission's intent was that, before implementing GICs, pipelines

          would negotiate settlements of their existing uneconomic take-or-

          pay contracts and file to recover the resulting settlement costs

          under the Order No. 500 equitable sharing mechanism. 616/ 

          Indeed, in the Transwestern order cited by VT DPS and Valero, the

          Commission suggested that Transwestern postpone implementation of

          its GIC until it had renegotiated its supply contracts and filed

          sharing mechanism. 617/  

               That mechanism included a fixed take-or-pay charge analogous

          to the direct assignment provisions of Order No. 888.  The

          Commission permitted pipelines to allocate to sales customers who

          converted from sales to transportation the same fixed take-or-pay

          charge that those customers would have been allocated had they

          not converted. 618/  Moreover, in a later order involving

          Transwestern's recovery of take-or-pay settlement costs under its

          Order No. 500 equitable sharing mechanism, the Commission

          expressly held:

                    In appropriate circumstances, the Commission
                    may approve exit fees for departing
                    customers, either through a condition on the
                    abandonment of the purchase obligation of
                    customers subject to the Commission's

               policy established in Transwestern concerning exit fees in
               the context of GICs.  The El Paso order is distinguishable
               from our approach to exit fees in Order No. 888 for the same
               reasons as Transwestern.

               As discussed in the preceding section of this order, the

          direct assignment provisions of Order No. 888, in essence,

          require that certain electric generation customers who convert to

          transmission-only service continue, for a period, to bear certain

          generation costs that they were previously bearing.  That

          requirement is similar to the Commission's requirement, in

          connection with its Order No. 500 program, that pipeline sales

          customers who convert to transportation-only service continue to

          pay the same Order No. 500 fixed take-or-pay charge as they would

          have paid had they not converted.

               VT DPS and Valero also claim that permitting electric

          utilities to recover stranded generation costs through exit fees

          to customers converting to transmission-only service is

          inconsistent with our 1995 order in El Paso, 620/ rejecting that

          pipeline's exit fee proposal.  We see no inconsistency.  El Paso

          proposed, several years after its restructuring pursuant to Order

          No. 636, to impose an exit fee on its firm transportation

          customers who terminated or reduced their firm transportation

               illustrated by the situation described in the cited
               Transwestern order, some sales customers had departed
               altogether from the systems of their historical pipeline
               suppliers before the Commission recognized the need for
               continued allocation of Order No. 500 take-or-pay costs to
               those customers.  In these circumstances, the filed rate
               doctrine prevented such continued allocation.
