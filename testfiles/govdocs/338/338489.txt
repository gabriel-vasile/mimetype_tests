need to keep the parents invohwl and kwp that in-
votwme~it as the!- make tra~lsitions throtlghout the
systems so that our children can be health\ and read\-
to lear11.

  IVe also felt that parents should be in\ohwl in
program design and the policl~inakillg decisions that
  L
affect and impact upon their children. One suggestion
is that NY form parent boards. which arc ven. pre\Aellt
in Hcaci Start but do not exist in man\' other systems.
Mter the transition occurs. parents need to continue to
be involved. For example, parents that are involved in
Head Start need to stay involved as their children grow
and 111ove through other programs.

  Parents need to form their own support groups.
M'hen they do, programs should work with them. In
other words. Fvhen a parent group forms a support
gro~~p to help themselves and to help other parents
l\.ork through the transitional process, the programs
and systems should be there for them. to support them,

help thtw lea~-~l thr tl-ansitional process, and provide
niatcrialsor \\,hatevrr thev need to make that transition
a'r 5niooth as possible.

  Program c-ounwlors should be appointed to help
]xl1-cnta pw]x"- for tl1 e transition. Also, parents need
to be ;ntare of'llot onlv the needs of their own children,
lxlt the iiceds of others-to move away from, "me, ni!
four. and no more."

  (:onsi\ttwc!. is the key to successful transitions.
\\`r nrrd to he aware of the impact on children and
parents of abolishing programs without notice, and
man\ times Ivithout preparation to haIre those needs
met through another area. M'e need stabilized funding
so that programs can address the problems. instead of
just looking at the symptoms.

  Someone suggested that the transitional process
\\.c)r~ltl lx> easier ifIve de\,eloprd an interstate communi-
cation \ystcwi. \l.e shol~ld crrate a national computer
network so that the information on parents in one State
could be readi]\. accewible to another State. \\`hen
people st~ch as the Xligrant \cwkers move from one
State to~ulothel.and the!.ha\,e toapplyforbenefits, the!
haw to closr out theirtilr in the first State, reapply at the
IleSt, go through that ~&olr process again, and reopen
their tilrs. Of'trn it takes a long time before they get thr
brnvfits. Sonit~tinies ttiev are ready to move on to the
next grwving wason or the next location before the
bellefits e\vn get started.  So. if we had a national
network. that information Icould be readily available,
and that could hprecl up that recertification or reappli-
cation process.

  .Yso, another thing that came up was to create a
\~a!. that school credits could be acceptable from State
to State. People move through different situations.
They have things that are credited in one State, and
when they go to the next State, the school says, "I'm
sort. but this is not credited here." Then, the child has
to go through that whole process again.

  Establish one-stop shopping-and I won't elabo-
rate on that because it has already been stated. Decrease
the time spent on paperwork. Make forms less complex.
And make an effort to cut down on the duplication of
information during the recertification process. hIan\

  The other area of concern \vas flexibility. TVe need
to make the eligihilit), criteria tlcxiblr. For example.
some people have incomes above the gt~itlrlines to
receive Medicaid but alw have chiltlwn uith special
needs. They can't get regtllar illsllrancc' brcause the

  .Another ;IIW of'concw-n is increasing and prornot-

act as ;tdw~at~s for parents and children so that they can

  The last and final area is that legislative action
must be taken to imprm e mu- children's transitions.
First, Eve see a role of the parent to take the responsihil-
i? to elect famil!.advocate5 in political offices. M'e need
to work to develop Federal and State lalvs and regula-
tions that better address the fzzrnilies' needs to make the
transitional process much easier. \Ve need to find a wa!
to enforce the la\vs that are already on the books. M'e
also need not tc>,just address the needsofone individual's
problems. For example. one of the parents shared that
they lvere in the process of suing the school system for
some needs for their children and that when that fight
is m'er, and that parent lvins. the next parent has to go
through thr same process. I\`r think that systems need
to Iearn from those fights with parents and those kinds
of things that happen. They nerd to learn from the
results so that other parents don't have to learn how to

I want all of you to know how much I appreciate this
opportunit\- to be here with vou.  I want to express
appreciation to all you parents, and I don't need to tell !WI
that your three representatives up here are tremendowsl~
articulate and \-em well prepared. I could talk for 2 hocus
just in responding to jvhat the three of them l1ar.e said.
and ob\iousl\.I don't have time to do that. I.rt me u\' that
I'm not just the head of the U.S. Public Health SclTicr:
I'm also a father. I have 7 children and 1 i grandchildren.
so I could sit out there as rvell as stand up here. I hope I
can express mv swnpattiv for hour point of \ie\v both as a
           
governmental official and as a parent.

  I think it \vas ?cls. Reel.es \vho talked about the
importance of our children. So often we read in the
newspapers about bein g conipetiti1.e lvith our automo-
biles. electronics, or pharmaceutical industry,, but \ve
are here to reaffirm that the most important pi-oduct
that this Nation has is its children. Our children are the
future of America, and even' minute ice spend here is
time morn than well spent. I believe--and I don't think
it's just because this is an election Year-I've never seen
a meeting \vhere the President and three departmental
heads (three Secretaries) came, and that's a commit-
ment ofthis Government to the importance ofchildren
and doing something in this partnership between the
Federal level and parents.

  I don't avant to repeat \\-hat has been said bsother
speakers. but I uwit to respond to a number of ques-
tions that lvcrc rai\ed.  MXen President Bush came
her-r :ultL talkvrl about his comprehensive plan for
health care reform. he \\-a~ addressing a number of the
problcw~ that have been described. This reform.
\vhich will provide tax credits or certificates and tax
cl~d~ictions. will encompass 9 million Americans. It jvill
pro~idr access to health care seiTices for all poor
Americans. It Ivill create insurance pools so that people
at high risk uill not have to pav those higher premiums:
the\.`11 be in the same pool with many other folks, to
a\eragv the Irisk out. The President talked to you about
health insiiranc.e security so if )`oii move from one
communitv to another, or from one job to another,
vow health benefitswould be portable. Then he talked
about choicr. \bou see, choice and a tax credit (a
certificate) empower a parent; vou don't have to be
part of a s!-stem for just poor people. You take vow
certificate and !~ou buy your health care from a pro-
gram that \vill provide the qualin and the content of

services that vou need.  Then he talked about

affordabilitv and cost containment. If we can conrince
Congress to enact this plan, itwill begin to address some
of the health cat-e problems that you are encountering
and that I encounter as a grandfather.

  1 wouldjust like to answer the question: "M'hat are
\ve going to do?" I.just want to mention t\vo things and
then I M-ill sit down. First ofall, we at-e here to listen, and
I think listening is probably the most important thing
\`ou can do so that you understand the concerns. Yoll've
heard the recomtnendations for solving these prob-
1~1~~s. But Ive need to do more than listen. Here's onr
example ofwhat 1 am going to do. Each quarter I meet
rvith the officials of State and territorial health depart-
ment\ and with vour State health department commis-
sioners. Each quarter I meet l\ith the L.S. (1onfercnce
of Ci tl, Health Officel-s and the Sational (:onferencc of'
(:ount~ Health Offtcers. I'm going to discuss the things
that you've been talking about with them because this
is a partnership. Itlras said that leadership should come
from all of us and, of course. it's got to come from
parents, our neighborhoods and communities, WI
cities, our counties, our State, and the Federal Govern-
ment. Only when WC all provide that leadership \vill this

  Sow let megive you an example. and time doesn't

There are communities-and I have visited them-in
the United States of Xmerica lvhere they have one-stop
shopping. Ifwe all avant it. let's do it! There isn't any
disagreement. LVe've talked about having a uniform
application form. I'm holding up a little document
that's called a hlodel Application Form, and this was
published in the F&lnl l?qistPron December 4, 1991, a
little o\`er a month ago. It lvas developed in collabora-
tion lvith State and local people, and it involved the
Department of Health and Human SetGces, the De-
pat-tmentof.~griculture,;~nd the DepartmentofEduca-
tion. So, at the Federal level, we want a simplified,
unified. uniform application. Sow why don't we ha\le
it> \Ve want the same things. You've got to startworking
up from the bottom, and we've got to work harder from
the top so that it gets all the way through.

   You've talked about flexible hours. You want
flexible hours; you not only want them, you need them.
And we want flexible hours. Last Friday, Secretaq
[Louis] Sullivan [Health and Human Services], Sur-
geon General Novello, CDC Director Bill Roper, and I
were in San Diego to talk about an immunization
initiative for infants. And what were we pounding the
table about? Flexible hoIn-s, so that parents could bring
their kids in the evening, on weekends.

  Let's make the systems user friendly. You want
user-friendly systems; we want user-friendly systems.
Let's work together to get it. We're not against each
other. W'e're working for the same things, and some-
how we have to get it into the middle. And I'm willing
to work on that, and I know you ivill as well. I'm simpl!

  ,Jim rwd thr term "user friendlv." Our schools
txtsicallv have never been user friendly because the
scltools that 1%~ har,e todav are designed for a societ),,
frankl\-, that doesn't exist today in tnost areas. I can
remember, sotnemonthsago, [Secretat-yofEducation]
I~mat- [Alexander] convened a group of us with an
eminent sociologist, a guy I have a lot ofrespect for and
who hasdonealot ofworkin thisareaforvears. Wewere
kicking around the question, "M'hy don't our schools
\vork any more?" And he said, "Heck, it's very basic.
LVhat vou are trying to do with your schools is for a
hunch of folks who don't exist any more."

  This gets to the access issue, what !ou need to do
\I-ith folks. They can't get at you, and you can't get at
them. So ~41~ don't YOU think about it? I think back to
the txprt-icnces I had as a principal years ago, working
in an area \vhere poor parents had many of the same
prohtettts that ~UII have addressed in your presenta-

. . . you've got to join us in that message

the other thing. At that time. xve had Title l-that \vas
27 years ago, when I came on board-and lye developed
what we called extended school. This is very. similar to
what Lamar mentioned that Decatur [Georgia] is doing
1101~. M'e ha1.e the Federal resources to open up the
access issue. You can change the mindsets out there if
you .join us in that attempt, working \vith our State
commissioners, your State legislators, and your local
school folks to "a)- that there is a system out there that
will support your needs, if it is prop+. designed. LVe
want access to it, and we want to use it. But !w~`ve got
tojoin us in that message that we arr tqing to get across
to people that our schools must become user friendlv,
to prwide a setting for one-stop shopping-places
where education can go on and where multif:nmil~
services can go on in terms of local agency semices, State
agencv services. and. of course, the edrlcational srlvices
that should go on on a continumn, places where a
school operates from early in the morning until late at
night and on weekends and is open during the school
year, where it never closes, and it shouldn't. It's your
largest real propert!' im.estment. It doesn't mean the
teachers. as I.amar pointed oiit iii his remarks. haw to
take on all thew other chores. .rhCV ;1l`P not tl.aillcd to

do so-fine. But with that kind of setting, or a setting
comparable to it in a community, we can reach and
provide fi)r children and their families the kinds of
needs that 1j.e need to meet today.
  It really bothers me terribly-to the point where I
don't understand it-lvhen I think back to the late
19.3)~ and 1960s. LVhen we built elementam schools, we
built little clinics in them, and dental centers, and so
forth. TI?. to find a new elemental? school today that
has that provision where lve can provide that kind of
sellice to a child and his family. It doesn`t happen an!
more. \Z'e have to return to some of the things we
identified earlier on that parents need and children
need and get back to it ancl make those provisions and
open up those schools to do those things.
  Let me talk about transition for a minute. Ldrly
[Bell] ux+ talking ahout transition. Let me throw out a
bias of mine that we'w been tqing to work with-
[<:on~missionr1-- of the ,Administration for Children,
Youth and Families, Department of Health and Human
Sel-\ices] \l'ade Horn and his folks. Transition. to me,
means from conception to birth; it means from birth to
school and community; and it means to the final thing
that the President has also mentioned, and that is to
making a life. Cnless Ive have the kind of system in place
that provides for that and can deliver that, we're going
to find ourselves generationally not making strides that
we need to make to address the needs that we have
toda!,. Looking at some of the things that I looked at for
the past 3 days in a Third M'orld country-that can't
happen here. L2'e have the ingenuity, resources, intel-
lect, and experience that most people don't on how to
approach this effort, and we can do it.
  Let me sa!`in closing thatifweusewhatwe know and
use it creatively, lve can de\-elop support for what we are
tl:ing to put through in I-ealltllorization ofall the elemen-
tal-y and seconday programs-that's 57 programs and
currend!. over $9 billioll. Mhat we are tn-ing to say is that
\w need a massiw urban inten.ention program utilbing
Federal IWOWC~Y ill conjunction \\ith State and local
resources to prcnide for communities. an opportunitv to
pl;ii~ fir \chatt~\w liiiinht7 of IXYII~ ir take5 to pull those
w5iourct~\ lf)j:t~tl~tv. Iocatiqq the scl~ool ~~~~ainotlwr center


as a hub to pi-wide an csrcwclctl set-\& or euttwdrd
school concept so that children and their families can
utilize. thevarious resourcesin collaboration to accommo-

date the needs we have.

  \Vr have many programs out there currcii tly. for
example, that can help each other.  For example.
\Vade's program [Head Start], even with the President's
increasr, will still not se17.e all dir ~~oringsters Ivlio are
currently eligible. But M'ade can use our program Even
Start, which is for children 0 through 7 years old and
their parents, to provide not only parenting and child
care sel-\ices but also job training and placement ser-
vices. That program can buy Head Start seiyices. can be
used to expand Head Start sellices, or can create its
own. Our Chapter I program, lvhich is basically age
neutral. can also be used to by Hrad Start sellices.
expand Head Start senices. or bur. their o~vn.

  In other words, what I am sa!+ng is that in terms of
integrating what we haw currentl\~ on the books today,
we can do a better job. M'ith our Department of
Agriculture, with its LVomen. Infants. and (:hildrtw
[MI'IC] programs, \ve've recenth signed a 1lemoran-
dum of Understanding I\,ith them so that our \Ligrant
programs can iitiliye \+I(: stwice5. \Ve \\aiit lo c~xpantl
that to Even Start because (Congress. on our request. has
now expanded the age range. Ilot for children from 1
through 7 years old. but from 0 to i: I Irish I could get
it from prenatal to 7. But it's in this\va\.that \vv tie things
together. and the Surgeon (;cnc~-al and hrr officr l\ith
the Healthy Childrrn Read!, to Learn Task Fol-cc has
been instrumental in pulling those of us together \vho
have been wwrking on this so that, again. Eve are mart
integrated than WE have been before.

   M'el~illcontinrle tostrive in thisdirection, butweare
going to need your support lvith Congress to continue in
this direction, lvhere we are pulling together and coordi-
nating all the Federal efforts around the one focus-lvhat
L\-e need to do for our children and our families who need
them the most. Thank you VCIT much.

Pwsident Bush has told those of us whom he appointed
to jobs in his adininistl-atiotl that he wanted us "to work
to t-rorient gor.ernmenT to better seme the needs of
individuals." 1 rtmember that quote exactly because I
thought that was so critical to defining our jobs; it is
certainlv critical to defining why Dr. Novello has con-
\,ened this Conference: to talk about one group of
people-children and their parents-and hog., bywork-
ing together with parents on behalf of healthy children,
~vc are helping children be ready to learn and to grow
strong. Your confidence in Dr. Novello is vey well
placed, and I know that she has been not only an
outstanding spokesperson for these issues, but also, in
convening all of us together, is making a constructive
ef'fort to seeing this happen. I've learned a lot alread!
today, and I'd like to share some thoughts in several
areas: one-stop shopping, senice coordination, im-
pro\iyg services. empowerment, and then finally some
ideas about solutions.

  Before I start. though, first of all I wzit to explain
\\-h!. I am here. r\s Secretay. Madigan said when he
spoke !wterday. the Department ofAgriculture spends
more' than half of its budget on food assistance pro-
grams for the poor and for children throughout the
country. So in m!. portfolio, I manage the Food Stamp
program, school lunch and breakfast, MIC, summel
f&d program. food program on Indian resen,ations,
food for the elderly, food for childcare centers, Head
Start centers, and others--there are 13 programs all
together. with Food Stamps, school lunch, and 17C
being the largest. Also, I come here as a colleague of the
people at the table and as a colleague of Dr. Novello's
and Dr. Mason's.

  Onr-stop shopping, as Dr. Mason said, is abso-
lutely a must around the country. We agree totally on
that issue in bringing all social services together, and as
every speaker here said, that is a critical component. M'e
have been sending a lot ofbooks to Delaware because 12
centers there have combined all social senices except
forjob training-M'IC. Food Stamps, AFDC, Medicaid,

\arious child development projects and programs-all
together itI one office. I visited one of thaw offices: it
was a pleasant place. One receptionist see\ the clients.
and all of their information is on a computer. u9~ich
sounds simple and makes sense. But it wx\ a Hugh
undertaking for the State to cotxince the different
Federal agencies ittvolwd to all participate in that
project. It is a tnodcl. and \\v encouragt tnan~~ States-

we sent many people there--to see how that works,
hoping that UY can help them go more tolvard one-stop
shopping in putting sewices together.

  The President mentioned the immunization pro-
gram. M'e've been vev involved in that from the M'IC
perspective because it isone ofthe fewplaceswherever)
\uung children come within the sx-stem.  If we can
combine setTices and provide immunization services
there at L1'IC clinics, it might he a \`et-) productive and
helpful program to initiate. To that end, Dr. Mason and
I ha1.e bcrn wn-king aggressively with health directors
arottnd the countty~ to promotejoint senices for immu-
ni/ation and I\?C.

  Secretar~~ Sladigan yestet-da!- mentioned direct
certification fix-children in the school 1~1nch program.
This is a ct-itical program. and I Icant to expand on it
brieflv. It doew7~ make sense that a child may not be
able to access a school lunch or breakfastjust because
ofa hunch of papetxw-k that wxsn't turned in. Thewy
the system uwrked before direct certification, as you
knolv, was that at the beginning of the year, the school
sent home a form, through the child, to the parent that
said, "Please fill out this form. Your child may be
eligible for a free or reduced-price meal; tell us your
income." Many times those papers don't get returned;
a lot of parents don't want to fill out that paper; sotne
parents may never get it; some parents may not be able
to read it. So children end up not being in the school
lunch and breakfast program, under which they ma)
be eligible for free meals, because of paperwork. What
direct certification is doing-and in the counties that
have started this already, we'\-e had great success. and
it jusf began in September-is martying computer lists.
The). mart-y the computer list of the kids enrolled in
school with the families 1 hat are enrolled in AFDC and
Food Stamps. The!, keep this confidential; it follo\vs all
the confidentiality requirements. But instead of get-
ting a letter stating that `kwtt- child may he eligible,"
\vhcn this \vorl;s-and it has Ivot-ked so fat- in the mast\

  On the Food Stamp and .\FD(: hide. I 1~1s at the
Department of Health and IIttntan Senices managing
the ,\FD<: program beforr I cants IO [the Deparnnen~
of`] Agriculture. One of` the I-casons I ~\`a\ ashed to cot~le
is that the;\tltltinistt-atiott caresabout ttying to put these
programs together. Alntoat e~~~~otte ~vho is att AFDC
rrcipiettt receives Food Sta~ttps, :und tlir ttiajorit\. of
Food Statnprecipi~ntrrecri\r,~FD(:. Itcertainl! makes
sense to sinnplifi the rules and regulations. The people
who determine eligibilit\. have thick books in ever) State
for each ofXFDC, Food Stamps, and Medicaid. Atn~~ne
having to learn the rules and how to ~vork through them
takes OII a fairly remarkable chore. So Ivhat Eve are doing
is \2-ot-king on the Federal level to identify eligihilit\
requirements. So far, lve've identified 32 eligihilit\
factors that at-e different in the t~vo programs. ancl \ve
are lvot-king now to determine \vhich ones Eve can
change to make them the same ot- similar, so it \vill he
easier for eligibilit%. ~vorkera to manage. and ttltititatel~
easier for those \vlio at-e in need to access the sl3tettt itt
both programs.

  M'e learned from this process. ho~ve\w, that MY
have to idetitie- these [need4 chatige5]. bitt \\`e can'1
make all the changes otu-selves. .\lall\~ of thr ctlall~:es
\\ill require congressional approL4. and we \\ill be
looking at changes Iv. - can t~iakcc in the Federal (;o\-vrti-
ment and idrntifving jvhcn NY nercl to go to (:ottgrew
to request other changes.

  I found out one of thesr changrs lvhtm I first catttt~
to this,job. In Alahat~m I \vrttt to a Food Stamp office
to apph for Foot1 Stamps because I wanted to we Ito\\
the system lvorked. I filled out lots of forms. and tltrtt
the worker gave me one fortn that inclicated l had to
take it home and have tny husband fill it out. I haid.
"\I%!~? Yott'rr taking me at rn!. uwrd that I'm the head
of the household, and all these other fin-ms are OK for
tne to sign. LZ'h\- do I have to take this one home fc,t- him
to sign! -** "\Vell, because that's the requirement. Evet-r
adult in the housrhold has to siCgn this particular form."
iVeIl, that didti't make an! sense to me, \\hatever; it \vas

a tctrtn draliug \\ith ~vltrther or ttot \vc' \vere L'.S.
citiLettr. So. 1 came back and asked questions about it,
and a lot of'tlte cliCgihility workers laughed. M'e'd been
telling you that this \+`as duplication fi)r a long time. LVe
proposed in the Farm Bill to Congress that they change
this and elintinatt: the t~vo signature requirement, and
MY got it changed. Thar leas the good news. Then we
fottttd out that .XFDC: and Meclicaid have the satne
reqttirrtnetit.

  The final point on setTice coordination that I
\vatlt to mention is what I think is the most exciting one
we are working ott, and that is called Electronic Betteftt
Transfer. M'e ha1.e now in the Food Stamp program a
pilot prqject. and I lvant to explain what it is. This EBT,
as it's called, is using the equivalent of bank hTAM
[Xutomatic Teller Machine] technolog? for the pur-
pose of pro\iding benefits for Food Statnps and, poten-
Ml!., fat-.kFD(:. \\`I(:. and other programs as well. The
\~a\. this ~vot-ks is. or would be, that there are no longer
food cot~ponx in any cot~~tnut~ity that undertakes this
project. People get a plastic card ancl have a private PIN
[Pctvmal Identification Sut~~het-1. The State or the

"Children are empowered by getting
a good breakfast and lunch at school
so that they can learn better."

(as they must if' their food coupons or thrir .WD(: is
mailed) to make sure they. get it.  They dott't have to
cash the .%FDC check in one lump ~111 and aomt.tin1t.s

else trving to steal and use their coupons before the!, get
to thegrocet-ystore. It'saquicket-wa~toget through the
system when they get to the grocety store.

  In M'yoming, one woman at a cash register told me
that she had been a \7C client and now she was
working, managing the cashiers in the store. One of the
reasons that she liked working there MX that the card
took the confrontation away in the tine. Because (this
program was in MTC, she said, but it could \vork in M'I(:
or Food Stamps) the machine says what's eligible and
what's not eligible, there doesn't have to be a battle
between two people for that purpose. It's a benefit for
the stores; it helps them mo\`e people through the line
faster. It's a benefit for the clients on L27(: because !-071
don't get otw~ouchet-, one time a month. MXenvou get
one voucher once a month \`ou haw to ust' it all. atid

that's tough if they don't have vow type of cereal that
day. M'ith this new system, you can go back and use the
card again; vou don't have to buy all of vow milk once
a month and have it rot in the refrigerator, but you can
go back o\et- and over again. It's a real plus.

  It'salsoa plusfor the taxpayers, I have to say, because
it will ensure that all of the money that the taxpayers are
spending on food-in out- budget this year is $34 billion-
\\,ill be spent on food. and it ~511 be an overall plus. M%at
~vt' have to do is ensure that it's cost effective, and the wav
that it's cost effecti\,e \ve hope, through our studies, is
through combining set-\-ices.

  If \ve combine Food Statnps and AFDC and per-
haps MI<:, and perhaps someday other programs that
\vc can sa1.e on the administrative costs. which I think
Eva\ t~~entiot~ed b\, a couple of speakers before, it wilt
tl+ 11s ill th' hllg J-1111. That is the one problem: \ve
haw not yet pt-owd that it will save administrative
Monet-, but lve are determined to do that. States can
implement this program for Food Stamps after April 1
of this !~at- without a ctetllotlstt-ation project.

  >-L5 far as imprwing set-\-ices, as Secretary [of@icul-
ture] .\Iadigan said. President Bush for the last 2 years has
iiicreased the 1\7<: program by proposing larger increases
than any president ever-S223 million last year. $240
million this year. That combined total is going to help us
set\`e more than 300,000 tnore people in the \?C pre
gram. Improving senices in M'IC goes beyondjust putting
more people in the program: it extends to improving the
actual senices that we provide.

  One of the things that we've done in the NTC
program is to look. for instance, at the issue of protnot-
ing breast feeding, and the issue of helping to empolver
mothers to make a choice between breast feeding and
bottle feeding after they have given birth. Once when
I visited a\$`I(: store in Mississippi and Ivent through the
line looking at what I Mould buy, I told them I was a
breast-feeding mom. I scanted to go through the line as
a breast-feeding tnom attd pick up the food I would get.
I picked up mv peanut butter. eggs. cereal, milk, and 111:'
other products and thn they said. "Oh, rvell. if' \`()I1
\\c*-~JI'~ bt-t~astfecditlg. ltet-c. this i'i the ti~J~l1llI1~l tIl;ll IOIl

month that I couldn't carry it out of the `store! It is no
wonder to me that onlv 10 percent of M'I(: moms
breastfeed, when people may he thinking that they ma!
be giving up thislvondet-fit1 option of this great formula
for their child. Not only would we like to empowet-
women in making this choice. hut also provide mot-e
nutrients for women who are breastfeeding. LVe filed a
notice with the I;p~~tnl Register asking for comments.
and we intend to file a proposed rule as soon as we can
to offer a separate package for breastfeeding motns in
the MIC program.

  In closing, school breakfast is critical for children
coming to school read\- to learn-all of our studies
show that. Half the schools that ha\-e lunch also have
breakfast; we can have more. We've been going aroutid
the country encouraging schools to offer school break-
fasts, and it's realty critical for children to come to
school ready to learn. The swmier food progratn is
available-schools can offer it during the summer and
pri\ate non-profit schools can offer it during the sum-
mer to help children have tneats at school. ,-\I1 of these
programs empower people. The M1(: program em-
powers mothers to help make good decisions hv educa-
tion and nutritional support. Childt-et1 at-r empo\vet-ed
by getting a good breakfast and lunch at school so that
the), can learn better. These programs are empowered
by your comments and your direction to us.

  The solutions? How can we ivot-k together? EBT
can start in States for Food Statnps aftet- Xpril of this
year. You can tell \our State administrators and own
county administrators that you think that thev ought to
have EBT. You can work with our regional offices. M'e
will work with you, and I will takeJim Mason's lead and
work with the public welfare administrators and com-
municate )`our comments specifically when I meet with
the State Welfare Commissioners in 2 weeks. We can

work together with changes that will simplify the appli-
cation of AFDC and Food Stamps when we come up
with proposals. We can work together becausewe need
your help convincing our colleagues on the Agricul-
tural, M'avs and Means, Finance, Education, and Labot
Committees. It would be helpful if we had similar rules
for att of these programs. You also can help by going to

86  Parents Speak Out for America's Children

vow school, and ifvou don't have school breakfast, tell
the school. school board, or someone else who is a
decisionmaker in your community that you want school
breakfast for the children in your school. It's an entitte-
ment prog~xn; the Bush budget anticipates at least NO
schools entering the program next year, but it takes
cotntnunit~ leadership and community support to get
that done through the schools. Every person in this
room, those of us at this table, be they the parent
presenters or the people in the Administration, can do
a lot to work toget her so that we can take vour direction,
the thoughts that we have, and implement. We can
implement the President's direction to us to reorient
government to better seme the needs of individuals.
Thank you vet-y much.

It is a pleasure to be here today at the closing day of this
Conference and I want to thank the Surgeon General
fhr the invitation to participate here, but particularly to
thank her for her rzisdotn in acknowledging and


t-ecogniAtig the importance of the role of parents in
helping to get their kids to school health! atnd ready- to
learn. If we needed any mhdation of how criticall\
important parents are, we'\.e heat-d that fi-om the three
reprrsentatives here on the panel this mot-nitlg.

  I lrarn notjust from parents but also f'tx~ii my o\vti

because kids are out-future. I could bc txxl brief`hew and
1 could ~a>`. "Guess \vhat. 1 t-t111 Htwl Stat-t. Head Start
loot-ks; it's great." tit doubts, ;iiid cvmhod\ could applaud.
Because Head Start i.c a great pt-ogram: Iwotrw it. in fAct.
twbodics much of\vhat it is that thr patx*nfs tal!-.ctl about
toda\~. It embodies parent inwl\t'm~nt and empowcl--
ment. HeadStart haslongrecogt~i/edth;tt pat-ettt4ar~ tJtt
firstand niostitiipot-tatitedttcatot~softltrit~cltil~It~eti. .111tl
NY'V~ embodied that etnpo~verment in thr Hcd Start
parent policy councils. Also, Head Start integratccl health
senices with social senices long ago. Do thou know that
Head Start tnakes arrangctnenr.s for one of the largest
delivery systems of health senices to poor childt-en in this
cou11t1-G Last !`ear, more than 600,000 children in Head
Start got free medical and dental screenings and follwup
treatment, as well as itnmunilations, through the Head
Start program.

  It has also been a leader in removing barriers to
children with disabilities in terms of incorporating
them and involving them in the program as well. Head
Start has long recognized that children with disabilities
need to be mainstreamed. M'e were doing that back in
196.3. I was in the 5th grade, but in 196.3, we \vere doing
that. And we were a leader in that. In fact, today, almost
14 percent of all children enrolled in Head Start are
children with disabilities. We even pay parents for their
knowledge. Do you know that almost 40 percent of all
paid staff in Head Stxt are parents of children either
currentI\- enrolled in Head Start or formerlv enrolled?

But I'm not satisfied. and we shouldn't be satisfied

because there is still much to be done.

  I ani,just going to mention three titw challctigt3
and initiati\-e\ we are undertaking in Head Start. Fit \I

of all, \ve need more money we need to serve more kids.
The President, over the last 4 years, has increased our
budget by $1.6 billion. That's an incredible achieve-
mcnt--that's real money, even here in \%shington.

  The second thing we tteed to do is increase senices
to adults of children enrolled in Head Start. In the old

da\-s. \vc had this naive belief that we could save children
1~~ taking them out of`the home, working with them, and
wnding rhrm back. Lye know that doesn't work. Ifwe are
going to help children, UY have to help their parents.
O\w the last 3 vears 1t.e have been improving the kinds
attd quAiF. of senices to adults of children enrolled in
Hcxl Stat-t. particularl!.in the area ofadult literacy. By the
twd ol'this~~eat-, \ve lvill have an adult literacy program in
e\w?. Head Start progt-atn in this county. M'e need to do
a beuet-,job of' \\,ot-king lvith substance abuse problems
\vhtw the\. exist in the families we serve. A recent stud!
sho~~x that at least 20 percent of all adults who have
children enrolled in Head Start have a serious substance
abuw problem. \Ve need to do a better job, and we've
hem workingwith Dr. Mason and his staff, particularly in
the Office for Substance Abuse Prevention and also with
the Office of Treatment Improvement, to tv to better
coordinate senices around substance abuse issues in
Head Stat-t. focused on the parents.

  The third thing we need to do is to use Head Start
as a wedge to increase job skills of the parents who ha\ie
their children enrolled in Head Start, and we've been
doing that in active collaboration with the new Uob
Opportunities and Basic Skills training] JOBS program,
the 1988 Family M'elfare Act. and also with trying to merge
or coordinate with the [Job Training Partnership Act]
JTP.A prOgI-dlllS aS Well.

  M'e have to recognize that times have changed. We
have a number of homes with no parents at home when
Head Start is done at 12 noon. \Ve have to do a betterjob
of coordinating with new childcare monies, and particu-
larly childcare development block grant monies to
etlsm-e that, for those Head Start children who have
parents employd outside the home, NY can krrp thw

   Finall\-, in WI-ms of`tl-ansition. wv haw to do ;I better
,job of mo\ing kids from Head Start into the public
schools. IAI-IT Bell talked about nuking our kids rcad\, fir
school. but he also said that \VY ha1.e to do 3 better- job of
makiligo~u-schoolar~ad~-fi,rolII-kids. \Vv do. Sonictimes
people point to Hracl &II-t. a11t1 thev sin. "DOYOU think it's

eveI?thing that can possibly go MIXES in that child's
communitv. The fault is not Head Start's; \ve nerd to do

the things that you said this morning; it goes deeper than
that in other ways too.

  Forexample, I'm the parent oft~\,odaughters, one
of ~vhom should ha\.c lxen 4 a month ago, hut who,
despite all the efforts oftechnolofl, died. .&id I'm also
the parent of a little girl l\ho lvill he ?J next week. So I
ha\v, personall>-, lx~ause of that, a deep commitment
to man>. of the things that you do. Sirriilarl!,, I can go
through people i11 the Medicaid Bureau \vho are lvork-
ing OII eligihilit\. pohc!., on home- and community-
based 1vaiI.er.s. ul~o also have a commitment to making
things better, not only ;IS professional people working
in the Medicaid program, but who also are per$onall!
inwh.etl in some of the things that VOLI are involved in
as well. And that occurs not only at the Federal level-
that WY as people \hare these things-but also at the
State and local lt3.elr.

  1 I\ nnted to make a few comments today, and there
are man! things that I could say-so may'things thatwe
arc toting to accomplish, so man\ areas \vhere \ve are
still falling short, so man!` things that we have tolvork 011
togc-thrr.  \fedicaid is a massive program. It senes
almost :<O milhon A~niericans. and 1'7 million of those
;irv children. (Zhildrcn xc disproportionatel~~ repre-
sctitcd in tc~`rns of the tiIumbeI- of those in pavert!- that
;II`c ~cncd. \lorc? chiltlrrn in povertv are selyed than
ad~~lts 01' the disabled, fi)r example. But despite that,
and !OII all kno\\ this. it's become such a visible thing of
late. that wc` still seITc` les5 than 30 percent of people in
povvrtv in this counti? despite the fact that we are
q~vnding 0w1- S 100 1 11 10~1 o11 lledicaid this veal-. So,
              `II'
.\Iedicaid is receiving a lot of focus, not only through
reforms in the Medicaid program but also, more re-
tenth. through the President's proposal for- health
reform in terms of Medicaid's key role in that system
and also through additional ke). reforms that have to be
made in Medicaid to make it more responsive to the
.Xnierican people.

  There have been enormous changes in the Med-
icaid program lately in response to the co~~crns and
issues you've raised. There have been expansions in
eligibilitv. There are options and mandates in manr'
States; as many as 20 States have enormously expanded
eligibilin for children to the maximum. There are
changes for pregnant lvotnen and for inf'&its, again,

88  Parent5 Speal Out for America'\ Children


enormous changes, in response to the conce~~is ex-
pressed by you and others. I think the concern that I've
heard expressed repeatedly is about the dropoff or the
"falling through the cracks." That problem is one that
has not been addressed adequately so Far, but again I
think that the President's proposal is one that would
address it.

  In terms of sell-ice expansion. again, in \ltYlicaid,
there is an enormous recognition of some of the prob-
lems that are faced-increased flexibility in pro\-iclillg
waivers to keep disabled and other children at home
and not in institutions, and c'normous changes in terms
of the increased use of case management for various
population groups in Lledicaid. particularl!. fi)r preg-
nant women and for children, but also fog- disabled
children. Mhat I consider the greatest child health
reform in Medicaid since itwas enacted is the enormous
expansion in the Earl!, Periodic Screening, Diagnostic.
and Treatment Program. thy EPSDT Program, the
child health screening program in this countrv.

  Along with seI-\-ice and eligibilit!,expansion, there
are also enormous concerns about access. Tying to
streamline these application forms, getting etigibilit!.
workers out to places, and tying to expand the amount
of dollars paid to community health centers and persons

providing obstetrical and pediatric services are all access
issues in dealing rzith red tape problems, trying to
overcome some of the barriers that physicians and
other providers have with Medicaid. But again, as Dr.
Mason said, these are things that you and I believe, and
they are happening, but we need to continue to make
them happen.

  One thing that is a reality about Medicaid is that it
is a Federal-overseen and SLate-administered program.
States ha\-e enormousflexibility,which is both a strength
and a lveakness in the program as you try to make the
kind of changes that are most appropriate for your
communities. Through vour networks, the power and
cohesion vou are developing, you can effect change,
through your effective ad\,ocacy. I would suggest, as a
follo\+up to this conference, and ma),be this is alread)
planned. that you debrief your State h4edicaid people
about the kinds of things that you discussed and that
came out of this conference.

  iYe had a handout here: it rvas a one-page informa-
tion sheet about Medicaid, and on the flip side was a list of
all the regional off%zes for the Health Care Financing
.\dministration and the people there whom we have
designated to be responsible for maternal and child
health issues. Those people are available to you to help
vou to approach and access the system. Also, we have a
\vonderfully knowledgeable person, Bill Hiscock, whowill
be more than willing and eager to answer your questions.

  In terms ofyour quesCons, `M%at are you going to
do with these recommendations and all the time that
we've spent and the heart-felt feeling thatwe have about
changes that need to be made?" I have found this
enormously hetpfttt and also rejuvenating in terms of
my commitment in trying to make some of these things
happen, clarifying policies in what Medicaid will and
will not cover and in transportation, and making sure
that States are implementing the child health screening
service appropriately. So, for that I want to thank you.
I wish you much success when you return to your States
and discuss at that leyel the things that vou have disco\-
ered or he:i~-cl.


I accepted a call from Dr. Novello last evening, and I will
tell you I'm glad I came. I'm glad I accepted, and it is a
real l)lcasut-e to be here.  I. too, am a parent. \,I!
youngest is graduating front high school this year, but I
ant also an expectant grandparent; I don't have a
picture yet, but I have a sonogram, if you'd like to see
that. We're anxiously awaiting that. I've been involved
in the activities of all three of our children in the
schools, in the curriculum council, and in the PTA, and
Ijust want to say, keep LIP what you are doing.

  I'm here not only because I'm a parent. You're
probably saying, "M'hat the heck does Social Securit!
have to do with kids?" Well, most people think of Social
Security as a retirement program. And we are, I think,
avery successful retirement program. M'e have a budget
of o\ (`1 S3OO billion, and we pay 40 million checks ever\
month on titne-we've done that for tnore than 31
years. We have 1,331 offices around the county, where
I assutne you all getve?good sell-ice \chen you go there.
We have people who sewe you with compassion and
efficient)-. \Ve't-e proud ofthat. But many people dott`t
realize that we at Social Security also have a great cleal to
do with children. Evet-\ month. we pa! more than Sl
billion to more than 3 ntillion children under one ofthc
Social Security programs because, in addition to retire-
ment, Social Security has a sunivor's program and a
disabilit!, program. We pay children of retired loot-kers,
children of disabled workers, children who are thent-
selves disabled, and children lvhose parents are de-
ceased and where there is a need for income. So. even
month we do pay 3 million kids more than Sl billion.

  Let me speak for a moment about some of the
things that we have done in response to the questions
that have been raised here. First, in terms of access, a
few years ago Social Security installed an 800 telephone
number, toll free, nationwide, 12 hours, from 7 a.m. to
7 p.m.. so that you can call us frotn anywhere in the
county. You'll get someone who will help you, includ-
ing bilingual help. If you need a referral, we can refer
from there.  We're talking about Social Security

"We are your servants here;.%&are
here to help you."

business, generally. We can't refer you for everything,
hut we will help you if you call us on that 800 number.
1Ve can make an appointment for you in one of the
offices ifyou need to cotne into the office. We're trying
to bring that service to whet-e people can access it from
their home, if the!. need it.

  Second, I lvould mention the progratn that we
aclmittister called SSI, Supplemental Security Income.
It reaches another 4 or 3 million eligible people. Cotn-
missioner King lauttched an SSI Outreach Program.
M'e recognize that we in government cannot do this
alone. \Ve cattttot find the people who might be
eligible for this program and who have a needs base
there. But Jve kttow thatyu in the cotnmunity do know
about people, so we'1.e begun an outreach campaign in
all of our local officeslvhere we tt? to educate those who
at-e inlwlved in the community to help us find those
~vho may be eligible for the program. It's been \ety'
successful, and we've had a `LO percent increase in
applications in both of the last 2 years, and we are
continuing to forge those partnerships with commu-
nity organizations. M'e need your help, and we'd be
glad to work with you in any of your organizations in
helping to find persons who may be eligible for SSI.

  Also in the last 2 pears, we have launched a special
program for childrett with disabilities who may be

SO Parents Speak Out for America's Children


eligible for SSI. Some of you may have heard of the
Zebley court case. In that situation, we've developed a
whole new procedure for determining disability in
children. \Ve've worked with pediatricians, school so-
cial workers, and others to define what disability means
in a child. We've had a lot of help from the Public
Health Service, and we've had a lot of input from
community groups. During the last year and a half,
\ve'ye taken 450,000 applications from children with
disabilities, and we've increased the nutnber of persons
receiving those beneftts from about 200,000 to more
than 400,000.
  You mentioned one-stop shopping. Meorkingwith
our colleagues in agencies represented here, we've
begun to integrate our senices. M'e are locating our
offtceswhenever we can together with other State. local,
and Federal offices that have the same clientele that we
do. Secretary Sulli\~an has launched a program of inte-
gration of senices, and all of us in [the Department of
Health and Human Set-vices] HHS are working closel)
to try to coordinate our service deliveqat the local level.
We do have a standard of service. For the first time, we
have published standards of service for our offices, and
we have just begun receiving public input to that. We
will be modifying that as we go along, and we will be
publishing our goals and how long it should take you to
receive service in a Social Security office. We issue a
Social Security card, for instance, in 10 days now. It used
to take us a month to do that. We have other goals, too.
We are trying to determine what is most important to
the public so that we can put our emphasis in that area.
I think it was Ms. Reeves who said, "What will we do, ifwe
don't like what we hear?" Well, I hope you'll call us, if
you have a problem or a concern about Social Security.
I mentioned the 800 number; if you call that number
and don't get satisfaction, I hope you'll call me. M!
number is 410-965-9000. We are your servants here; we
are here to help you.

Chapter 5

P resident George Bush and prominent members
  of his administration expressed their personal
  commitment to the Healthy Children Ready to

Learn Initiative by attending the Conference and speak-
ing to the participants. President Bush delivered his
keynote address in the afternoon of the first day. In
addition, each day of the Conference began with a
keynote speech given by heads of the cosponsoring
Go\rernment agencies: Secretary of Health and Human
Senices Louis Sullivan: Secretary of Agriculture Ed-
ward Madigan; and Secretary of Education Lamar
Alexander. Roger Porter, Assistant to the President for
Economic and Domestic Policy. also addressed the
participants. This section contains their remarks.'

George H. Bush
President of the United States

M ight I just say at the beginning of these brief
     remarks that I am \`en proud of Lou Sullivan
     and what he's doing as Secretan of Health

and Human Senices. He's doing a superbjob, and we all
are grateful to him. And let me just szay it's a pleasure to
be here today to help launch this historic Conference.

  I particularly want to thank our Surgeon General.
Antonia No\Tello. She has inspired people all across the
country with her example and her message. And she
sums it up this way, better than anyone: "All children
have a right to be healthy." Then she say, "LVe need to
speak for those who cannot speak for themselves."

  That's why you've gathered here this week, and
you've come to lead a great movement of parents,
doctors, teachers, public programs, and private enter-
prise-a movement destined to transform America.
Here's our goal: By the year 2000, e\-eq,American child
will start school healthy and ready to learn. Our success
will provide a lifetime of opportunity for our children.

It will guarantee the health and safety of our families
and neighborhoods, and it will ensure that America
remains the undisputed leader of the world.

  Now, I atn proud that our administration is part of
this movement. In this administration, families come
first. We're proud to join hands with people like Trish
Solomon Thomas, who has come from New Mexico to
be here this afternoon. She has hvo children, both of

them ivith special health needs. She perfectly expressed
the spirit of our movement lvhen she said, "I used to be
shy, but I had to learn to stand up for my kids." And
that's why rve't-e here, to stand up for our kids. We will
not let them dol\n. Our movement draws its strength
from Trish and the millions of parents like her. The title
of this Conference says it all: "Healthy Children Read)
to Learn: The Critical Role of Parents." Parents are a
child's first teachers, offering the love and spiritual
nourishment that no government program can ever
hope to provide.

  If I can brag forjust a minute here toda!,, you may
know of Barbara's work promoting literacy. I'm \Te?
proud of her. She wants to help parents understandjust
how important it is to read to their kids. When parents
read aloud to their young ones, they open their children


to the jovofa largerlvorld: thev teach the self-aswrance
    
and curiosit\ that comes ft-om teat-ning. Rarbara asked
me to extend her best wishes. She's now on a leartling
program, an education program right this minute. in
the State of' Mississippi.

  Our movement instills the habits of good health:
wholesome nutrition, sound hygiene, and profecti\.e mea-
sures like eat-l~imn~tmi~ation. Parents know that teat-tting
and health are tlvo sides of thr cante coin. .-\gain. parcnts.
families, and comn~rtt~ities at-e the key. But go\wttttwttt
can help and must help. Last June, fill- tw11pk. Dr.
Stilliwn and I, with able advice from Dr. So\yllo. took
steps to etiwre that no .~merican child i5 at risk fi-ant
deadh, diseases like polio. diphtheria, and tnw4c~. \2't

I'm proud we've been able to help. Since 19tiX. \ve'\.v
more than tripled thr dollars for Federal itntltttnir~ttiotl
efforts, ft-om SW million to $29'7 million for 1 !W.

  On Friday. Dr. Sullivan and the Surgeon General
and I were out in San Diego, and we had the privilege of
visiting Logan Heights Family Health <:enter to see
firsthand the benefits of this initiative. M'e spoke with
pawnts and cotntnunit~- leaders, and ever\- one of them
stressed the importance of early immunization in pre-
\wltingillne\s. Logan Heightsis. one ofmany, I'msure.
a perfect esample of rrhat can he done if concerned
itttli\-iduals set their minds to it. The Centerwas founded
1~. a \\.ondet-f'ttl ~voman named Laura Rodriguez, who's
brcotne one` of our administration's Points of Light,
helping others and setting an exatnple in the process.
I.aura MN a nerd, and \vith hard lvork and dedication,
4te rolled up her slee~rs and did wmething about it.
I.ogan Heights now setl.er 7.3.000 patients a year. So 1
~a!`. "Thank God fat- people like Laura. She's an ex-
ampk for all of us." There are many, many other
esampl~s right here in this room.

  For those kids\vho need a head start in preparing for
school, i\`e've made sure that the!`11 get it. In the last 3
J vat-s, we have almost doubled the fttnding for Head Start


progrmts. and this ytr. I ha1.e l~roposed thca Iat-gtw sittgle
increase in Head Start's ltistoty: SW0 million. Thi\vear's

start school ready to learn. Head Start hringschildrctt and

people care. \Ve't-e making 5ure it continue\ to MX)I-~. If
it's good for America`s kids, it's good for Xmerica.

  These are important steps. Rut there'\ mow to
do. 1Ve must address the larger issues of Xmet-ican
health care. Last week. I proposed a four-point plan to
dojust that. Eve?- American family must have access to
affordable, high-quality health care.

  I don't need to tell you that the Amet-icatt health
care systetn has probletns.  The crisis has probabl!
touched many of you right here in this room. Right
now. more than 8 million children go without health
insrtrance because skyrocketing costs have placed co\:
et-age beyond the reach of their parents. And even
parents\vhoare co~eredwor~aboutlosing theirfamily's
insurance if they move on to a different job or, worse
still, lose the ,job they have. You shouldn't have to live

\vitli this kind ol` uncertaitttv.  No American f&nil\
should. and tttv proposal lvould put an end to that.

  1'et I think \ve should keep one thing in mind. It's
impot-tant to rrtnetnber that, for all its problems, our
health care system still provides the best health care in the
\vorld. That's [VII\- people ft-om all over the world come
here seeking better care. Most often they're ?ing to
rscapc health care systetns in w,hich the go\`ernment
dictates how much care you'll get and what kind you'll get
and Ivhen you'll get it. In America. that's wiacceptable.

  Out- great challenge, then, is to keep what works in
our system. and then reform what doesn't work. We
must tnaintain a maximum freedom of choice and the
highesr qualit!, care. At the Same time, we must tnake
sure that our children have access to health cat-e their
parents can afford, sick or healthy. rich or poor.

  That's Ivhat this four-point plan does, and let me
,jusI brieIlL- spell it out for you. First, I want to make
health care mow affordable and accessible. I want a
SS.`7.50 tar credit for lolv-income families to help them
INI\ health insur;tnce: for middle-income families, I've
1~1~~1~ored ;I tax dedrtction for the Same atnount. Poor
people, those \vho don't file taxes, also Mould be COY-
errtl under this plan.

   Seco~td. to cut costs, 1t.e will tnake health cat-e
more ef`ficicvt. The math is simple: The larger the
group beittg cowred, the louver the cost pet- individual.
So i\.e'\e proposed health insurance net\vorks that bring
compattirs together to cut administrative costs and
make ittwrance affordable for \\-orking parents.

   .-\nd third, r1.e mttst cut ottt \vaste and abuse. M'e
can start lvith medical malpractice lawsuits that drive up
the cost of care for evevone. A doctor pestered with
frivolous litigation ends up passing his legal costs right
along to !~tu. thy Xmerican people, and right along to
the patient. \Vhen yougo to thedoctor, Idon'twantyou
to have to pay a la\zTer, too. Just pay the doctor.

  Finally, \ve must slow the spiraling costs of Federal
health programs. These costs are rising far beyond the
rate of inflation, and that only endangers important
benefits while making less money available for more
pressing needs.

   M'hat determines whether a childhood is a beau-
tiful sunrise in wartn tones of amber and crimson, or a
grim, colorless dawn? First and foremost, a child needs
to be secure in the love of his or her parents. h father
who reads to his child each night before bed, or a
mother who proudly displays crayon masterpieces on
the refrigerator, is real])- laying the groundwork for a
positive school experience. In addition, a warm, color-
ful childhood is a healthv childhood. Children's health
and their ability to learn are mutually dependent. Be-
ing ready to learn depends upon a child haling enough
to eat, being protected frotn preventable diseases, grow-
ing up free from environmental pollutants, and having
access to health care. Helping parents to provide a
healthy childhood for their children is a central part of
the mission of my Department.

  In his fiscal year 1993 budget, President Bush has
provided us a blueprint for action.  The President's
budget proposal has three areas of emphasis: First, j\e
must imrest in children; second, we must focus on preyen-
tion; and third, programs must empower parents.

Investing in Children

Investing in children is sitnpl!, good health care polic!.
The time and resources we devote to children now will
pay continuous dividends in the future in the form of
healthier and tnore productive citizens. In recognition

r

ofthis tact, the Pt-esidrnt's b@get proposes to increase
im.estmettt progt-ams serving children to $100 billion,
up from S60 billion in 1989.

Healthy Start

The first few years of life, beginning in the womb, are
the most crucial period of child development. There-
fore, if we truly desire to invest in the next generation,
we must begin before the child is even born. We must
begin bv making sure every mother receives early,
quality prenatal care. Overall, nearly 25 percent of all
women-and nearly 40 percent of Black and Hispanic
women-do not receive prenatal care in their first
trimester of pregnancy.

  Lack of prenatal care is a contributing factor to
this Nation's disgraceful it&ant mortality t-ate. Despite
spending tnore on health cat-e than an): other nation,
the United States retnains 23th among nations in the
rate ofsur~i~A of'infants. Each \`eat-, 40,000 American
babies do not 1il.e to celebrate their first birthday.
Black babies art' more than twice as likely as white
babies to die.

  The President and I ha1.e made infant mortality a
national priorit\ by developing a new infant health
initiative, Health\ Start. Our strategy is to concentrate
resourcw in 1 .i contn~ut~ities Ivith stubbornly high in-
fant mortalit!. rates.  Each community is given the
flesibility to create a mix of setTices tailored to the
tireds of their population. \Ve are requesting 5143
million to prwide these 1.5 communities with the re-
sources necessary to full!, implement their detailed
strategies for reducing infant mortality rates by at least
50 percent ovet- a .5-!,eat- period.  We will use the
kno\vledge gained from these demonstration prqjects
as a model for other communities across the Nation.

Focus on Prevention

The President's budget also will focus resources and
attention on pre\,entive health programs. Common
sense argues that it is better to invest in prevention and
screening programs than to Ivait until the advanced
stages of disease. when treatment is more cotnplicated
and more costly.

"It is fto surprise that our most suc-
cessful ~pfugrams for children-like
Head Start-are built upon direct
parental involvement."

Immunizations

Childhood immunizations are a~nong the most cost-
effective prevention acti\,ities.  Z\ Sl investment in
measles-mumps-rubella Gwcine ma\- return S 11 in
avoided medical care costs. M'e can be proud of the fact
that 97 percent of American children entering school
are immunized. Ho\\.ever, to be fully protected, chil-
dren need to be properly immmlized by the time the!
are 2 years old. Our rates among preschoolers are much
lower, and in some inner-city areas, the immunization
rate among 2 year olds is an abysmal 20 percent.

  That is whv the President has requested $.?2 mil-
lion for our immunization activities-an increase of 138
percent since 1989. My Department will use this in-
crease to target those children most at risk. These
dollars will translate into 6.7 million polio vaccinations,
4.1 million measles-mumps-rubella vaccinations, and
2.6 million hepatitis B vaccinations.

LeadPoisoning

Lead poisoning, the most common environmental dis-
ease ofyoung children, is another preventable disease. As
many as 3 to 4 million American children under 6 years
old may have lead levels in the blood high enough to cause
developmental dclal.5. learning disabilities. heha\ioral
problems, decreases in intelligence, and tA\.en death.

  Low-income, minority children growing up in ur-
ban areasare most at risk ofhaving dangerously high levels
of lead in their blood. The President's budget requests
S40 million, a 90 percent increase, for CDC Lead Poison-
ing Prevention Grants. These grantswill support about 30
statewide lead poisoning screening programs.

Empower Parents

The third emphasisofthe President's budget is thecritical
role of parents and the need to support programs that
empower pal-ents. I trul!. believe that the family is real])
the first and best department of health and human
sel-\ices. LAnd I'd like to say, as well, that parents are a
child's first and best department of education.

  Educators often speak of the "hidden curriculum
of the home" to describe the important lessonswe learn
during our first few years of life. We learn that our
parents love us vel? much, and that gives us a sense of
securitv. IZ'e learn how to share, and we learn right from
left and right from wrong.

  These are not eas!' lessons to teach. And all too
often this learning does not occur because parents
cannot, or do not, attend to the needs of their children.
It is no surprise that our most successful programs for
children--like Head Start-are built upon direct pa-
rental involvement.

Head Start

Head Start has won the confidence of the American
people. It is known as a program that works and a
program that is worthy of our tax dollars. Many of you
in the audience are familiar with Head Start; some ma!
even seme on parent councils, which guide the opera-
tions of the individual centers.

   President Bush, a firm believer in the value of Head
Start, has proposed the largest single-year funding in-
crease in the histoy of Head Start. The $600 million he
has requested will seme an estimated 157,000 additional
children in 1993. These additions would mean that
fUnding for Head Start has more than doubled since
President Bush came to office.  This unprecedented

The President's Health Care Proposal

In addition to targeted intet>.entions such as Head
Start and Healthy Start, the President annout~ced last
week his health care reform proposal.  Under the
President's plan, the middle class will get help to pa!
for health care through a new income tax cleduction.
For poor families, the plan guarantees access to health
care through another new feature: a health insurance
credit. In combination, these tax provisions Fuill help
more than 90 million ;\mericans and covet- 93 percent
of the uninsured.

  This morning I've outlined the tremendous ne\\
resources that the President wants to make available for
children. But more money alone is not enough. The
critical element of any initiative to help children is par-
ents. Unfortunately. for reasons ranging from parental
exhaustion to preoccupation with careers. children toda\
spend 40 percent less time rvith their parents than ther.did
in 1963-an average of only 17 hours a \\,eek! To put that
figure in perspective. Xmerican children spend an aver-
age of 2.5 hours watching television each l\,eek.

  I'm encouraged to see so many parents alit1 child
experts gathered for this Gmference. O\,er the next
few days, you will have the opportunit!, to USC ~~~nr
combined expertise to I~OIY this Sation to\vard the
goal that all children lvill begin school read\- to learn.
To borrow again f?om Milton, !-on jvill ha\.e the oppor-
twnity to make childhood a \varm and radiant sunt-i$e.
ushering in a day of golden hope.

  Thank you all. Godspeed to all of the Health!-
Children Ready to Learn participants.

N utrition is basic. hll things can be possible fol
    a child who is well fed: \er). little is possible to1
    a child, or a pregnant mother, or anyone fat
that matter, who doesn't get the nutritious foods \ve all
need to grow, to learn, and to excel. It's ourjob to get
that information to you and before the public and into
e\,eryday practice. There are 64 million children in the

United States t&a!,, and all of them share this need.
That's why we're here this morning.

  The Prrsident recognized the importance of a
strong nutrition foundation in his education initiative.
The first of his six National Education Goals is that "B\

the \`ear %M~. all children in Xmerica will start school

ready to learn."

  To achieve this, we have to ensure that they re-
ceive the nutrition thev need for healthv minds and
bodies. That responsibility begins before children are
born. M'orking lvith mothers, we must ensure that the
number of low-birthweight babies is significantly re-
duced through good prenatal care.

  Xlthoughwe are investing large amounts ofmoney
alld effort to help, it's the parents of children in these
programs \vho have the primary role to play in their
care and feeding. One of our best progratns for
reaching both children and the parents of children at
risk is the Supplemental Food Program for M'omen.
Infants, and (:hilclren. or M'IC. This program provides
suI~plrn~rntal food and nutrition education to low-
incomr pregllant, postpartum. and hrrastfeeding
\vomen: infants: ant1 voung children-all at nutritional
risk. \\`I(: scr~.es OIIC in three babies born e\-etT' year.
