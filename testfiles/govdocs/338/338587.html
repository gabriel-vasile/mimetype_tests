</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>

Menacing
<a href="http://science.hq.nasa.gov/kids/imagers/intro/intro1.html">flying</a>
forms and garish colors are a mark of the Halloween season.

They also stand out in
<a href="http://www.backyardastronomer.com/ccd/veileast.htm">this
cosmic close-up</a> of the eastern Veil Nebula. 

<a href="ap051206.html">The Veil Nebula</a> itself is a
large supernova remnant, the expanding
debris cloud from the death explosion of a massive star.

While the Veil is roughly circular in shape covering nearly 3 degrees
on the sky in the constellation Cygnus, this portion of the eastern
Veil spans only 1/2 degree, about the apparent size
<a href="http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2008/
28oct_halloweensky.htm">of the Moon</a>.

That <a href="http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/
scale_distance.html">translates</a> to 12 light-years at the Veil's
estimated distance of 1,400 light-years from planet Earth.

In this composite of image data recorded through
<a href="ap071102.html">narrow band</a> filters,
emission from hydrogen atoms in the remnant is shown in red with strong
emission from oxygen atoms in greenish hues.

In the western part of the Veil lies another seasonal apparition,
<a href="ap070101.html">the Witch's Broom</a>.

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>
Wisps like this are all that remain visible of a Milky Way star.  

About 7,500 years ago that star exploded in a 
<a href="http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/snr.html">supernova</a> leaving the 
<a href="http://www.skyhound.com/sh/archive/aug1/NGC_6960.html"
>Veil Nebula</a>, also known as the Cygnus Loop.

At the time, the <a href="ap010928.html">expanding cloud</a> 
was likely as bright as a crescent <a href="ap051113.html">Moon</a>, remaining
visible for weeks to people living at the dawn of 
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/334517.stm">recorded history</a>.  

Today, the resulting <a href="supernova_remnants.html">supernova remnant</a> 
has faded and is now visible only through a small telescope directed toward the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation">constellation</a> of 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_(constellation)">Cygnus</a>.

The remaining <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veil">Veil</a> 
Nebula is physically huge, however, and even though it lies about 1,400 
<a href="http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html"
>light-years</a> distant, it covers over five times the size of the 
<a href="ap020316.html">full Moon</a>.  

In images of the 
<a href="ap051206.html">complete Veil Nebula</a>, 
<a href="http://www.tewksburypl.org/images/computer%20cat.jpg">studious readers</a>

<a href="http://www.leif.org/mikael/veil.html">pictured above</a>.  

At the time, the 
<a href="ap010928.html">expanding cloud</a> 
was likely as bright as a crescent 
<a href="ap051113.html">Moon</a> toward the 
<a href="http://www.dibonsmith.com/constel.htm">constellation</a> of

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>

Cones, <a href="ap011125.html">pillars</a>, and majestic
<a href="http://www.goodearthgraphics.com/virtcave/staltite/
staltite.html">flowing shapes</a> abound in
<a href="http://archive.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Cyberia/Bima/StarForm.html">stellar
nurseries</a> where natal clouds of gas and dust are buffeted by
energetic winds from newborn stars.

A well-known example, the
<a href="http://www.skyhound.com/sh/archive/jan/NGC_2264.html">Cone
Nebula</a> within the bright
galactic star-forming region NGC 2264, was captured in
<a href="http://sites.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/2002/11/
pr-photos.html#b">this close-up view</a>
from the Hubble Space Telescope's
<a href="http://hubblesite.org/sci.d.tech/nuts_.and._bolts/
instruments/acs/">Advanced Camera for Surveys</a>.

While the <a href="ap020107.html">Cone Nebula</a>,
about 2,500 light-years away
<a href="http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/mon/index.html">in Monoceros</a>,
is around 7 light-years long,
<a href="image/0205/cone_hst_label.jpg">the region</a> pictured here
surrounding the cone's blunted head is a mere 2.5 light-years across.

<a href="http://www.anzwers.org/free/universe/5000lys.html">In our neck</a>
of the galaxy that distance
<a href="http://www.anzwers.org/free/universe/12lys.html">is just</a>
over half way
from the Sun to its nearest stellar neighbor,
<a href="ap020425.html">Alpha Centauri</a>.

The massive star
<a href="http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/97/16.html">NGC
2264 IRS</a>, seen by Hubble's infrared camera
in 1997, is the likely source of the wind
sculpting the Cone Nebula and lies off the top of the image.

The Cone Nebula's reddish veil is
<a href="http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr162/lect/light/

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>

Looking toward the constellation
<a href="http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/cyg/index.html">Cygnus</a>,
a stunning and complex region of nebulae strewn along
the plane of our
<a href="http://home.arcor-online.de/axel.mellinger/">Milky Way</a>
galaxy is revealed in this unique
<a href="http://www.galaxyimages.com/gallery.html">wide-angle</a> sky view.

Recorded with a filter designed to transmit
<a href="http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr162/lect/light/
absorption.html">light emitted by</a> hydrogen atoms,
<a href="http://www.galaxyimages.com/CygnusH-a.html">the image emphasizes</a>
cosmic gas clouds in a 34 by 23 degree field centered
on the well known Northern Cross asterism.

Bright, hot, supergiant
<a href="http://www.astro.uiuc.edu/~kaler/sow/deneb.html">star
Deneb</a> (the top of the cross)
and popular
celestial sights such as the <a href="ap000501.html">North

and the <a href="ap031016.html">Crescent</a>
and <a href="ap030204.html">Veil nebulae</a>
can be identified by placing your cursor over the image.

Silhouetted by the glowing
<a href="http://www.internal.org/view_poem.phtml?poemID=120">interstellar</a>
clouds and crowded star
fields, the dark Northern Coal Sack is also visible, part
of a series of obscuring dust clouds forming the Great Rift 
<a href="http://home.arcor-online.de/axel.mellinger/mwpan45_c.html">in
the Milky Way</a>.

These Cygnus nebulosities are all located about 2,000 light-years
away.

Along with the Sun, they lie within the
<a href="http://www.anzwers.org/free/universe/5000lys.html">Orion
spiral arm</a> of our galaxy.

<b> Explanation: </b>

These ghostly filaments of interstellar gas are just a small
part of the
<a href="http://www.astropix.com/HTML/E_SUM_N/VEIL.HTM">expansive
Veil Nebula</a>, seen against a rich field
of background stars in the
<a href="http://www.seds.org/Maps/Pics/cygnus_fig.gif">long-necked</a>
constellation
<a href="http://www.seds.org/Maps/Stars_en/Fig/cygnus.html">Cygnus</a>.

Also known as the
<a href="http://free.pages.at/visualastronomy/ds/brneb/cyg/
ngc6992.htm">Cygnus Loop</a>, the Veil Nebula is a
<a href="http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l2/
supernova_remnants.html">supernova remnant</a>,
the expanding debris cloud created by a stellar
explosion whose light first reached planet Earth
from 5,000 to 10,000 years ago.

About <a href="ap030118.html">1,400 light-years away</a>,
the entire nebula now appears
to span over 3 degrees on
the sky, nearly 6 times the apparent size of the full moon,
but is faint and can be difficult to see in small telescopes.

The region captured in
<a href="http://www.starryscapes.com/nebula/ic1340.html">this
beautiful, deep, color image</a>
is located at the southern tip of the Veil's
<a href="http://www.astrosurf.com/jwisn/eastveil.htm">eastern
crescent</a>.

It covers about 10 light-years at the distance of
the Veil and is cataloged as <a href="http://www.ngcic.org/scanned/

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b> 

Cones, <a href="ap011125.html">pillars</a>, and majestic
<a href="http://www.goodearthgraphics.com/virtcave/staltite/
staltite.html">flowing shapes</a> abound in
<a href="http://archive.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Cyberia/Bima/StarForm.html">stellar
nurseries</a> where natal clouds of gas and dust are buffeted by
energetic winds from newborn stars.

A well-known example, the
<a href="http://www.skyhound.com/sh/archive/jan/NGC_2264.html">Cone
Nebula</a> within the bright
galactic star-forming region NGC 2264, was captured in
<a href="http://sites.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/2002/11/
pr-photos.html#b">this close-up view</a>
from the Hubble Space Telescope's
<a href="http://www.ball.com/aerospace/acs.html">newest camera</a>.

While the <a href="ap020107.html">Cone Nebula</a>,
about 2,500 light-years away
<a href="http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/mon/index.html">in Monoceros</a>,
is around 7 light-years long,
<a href="image/0205/cone_hst_label.jpg">the region</a> pictured here
surrounding the cone's blunted head is a mere 2.5 light-years across.

<a href="http://www.anzwers.org/free/universe/5000lys.html">In our neck</a>
of the galaxy that distance
<a href="http://www.anzwers.org/free/universe/12lys.html">is just</a>
over half way
from the Sun to its nearest stellar neighbor,
<a href="ap020425.html">Alpha Centauri</a>.

The massive star
<a href="http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/97/16.html">NGC
2264 IRS</a>, seen by Hubble's infrared camera
in 1997, is the likely source of the wind
sculpting the Cone Nebula and lies off the top of the image.

The Cone Nebula's reddish veil is
<a href="http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr162/lect/light/

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>

Interstellar <a href="ap990509.html">dust grains</a>
often find themselves in a reflective "mood".

Near a bright star, clouds of these dust particles scatter
short wavelengths of visible starlight
<a href="http://www.physics.muni.cz/~ondra/mix/mix.html">more readily than</a>
long wavelengths, producing lovely blue reflection nebulae.

Nine of the more spectacular examples of these dusty, blue

neighborhoods</a>
have been assembled here by

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>

After 5,000 years, the gorgeous
<a href="http://www.astropix.com/HTML/E_SUM_N/VEIL.HTM">Veil
Nebula</a> is still turning heads.

Cataloged as NGC 6992, these glowing
<a href="ap000426.html">filaments</a> of interstellar
shocked gas are part of a larger spherical
<a href="http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l2/
supernova_remnants.html">supernova remnant</a> known as the
<a href="http://www.seds.org/billa/twn/cygnusx.html">Cygnus Loop</a> or the
Veil Nebula -- expanding debris from a star which
<a href="http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/
supernovae.html">exploded</a> over 5,000 years ago.

This color digital image of a
<a href="http://www.galaxyimages.com/bitoveil2.html">bit
of the Veil</a> has been processed
and enhanced to reveal stunning details in the diaphanous cosmic cloud.

Seen from our perspective against a rich Milky Way star field,
the Veil Nebula is
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?
bibcode=1999AJ....118..942B&db_key=AST&high=3899d8d98207083">now
known</a> to lie some 1,400 light-years away toward the
constellation <a href="http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/
constellations/Cygnus.html">Cygnus</a>.

At that distance,
<a href="http://www.wam.umd.edu/~tlaloc/archastro/">witnesses</a>
to the original stellar explosion would have
seen a star <a href="http://www.att.virtualclassroom.org/vc99/vc_04/
mainindex.html">in the heavens</a>
increase in brightness to about -8 <a href="http://www.projectpluto.com/
manual/app_g.htm">magnitude</a>, roughly corresponding to
the brightness of the crescent <a href="ap010809.html">Moon</a>.

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b>
Ten thousand years ago, before the dawn of <a href=
"http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_334000/334517.stm"
>recorded human history</a>, 
a new light must suddenly have appeared in the 
night sky and faded after a few weeks.  

Today we know this light was an <a href=

>exploding star</a> and record the colorful expanding cloud as the 
<a href="http://nineplanets.org/twn/cygnusx.html"

<a href="http://www.ngcic.com/dss/dss_images.htm"
>NGC</a> 6960 
but less formally as the Witch's Broom Nebula.  

The rampaging gas gains its colors by impacting and 
<a href="ap960307.html">exciting existing</a> nearby gas. 

The 
<a href="supernova_remnants.html">supernova remnant</a> lies about 
1400 light-years away towards the constellation of

</A><br>
<b> Explanation: </b> 
A <a href="http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/RGO/leaflets/supernovae/supernovae.html"
>supernova explosion</a> of a high-mass star results in fast moving blast
waves.  At the front of the waves shown above, ionized gas in the 
<a href="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/billa/twn/cygnusx.html">Veil
Supernova Remnant</a> rushes out from the explosion, sweeps up material, and
breaks up many atoms into constituent ions and electrons. 
<a href="file://stsci.edu/stsci/epa/tiff/cloop.txt">Observations</a> with
the <a href="ap950810.html">Hubble Space Telescope</a> 
in 1993 indicate that the blue shock wave was
catapult away from the stellar explosion after the red shock wave and has
yet to catch up to it in some regions. The Veil supernova remnant's has a
very large angular size - six times the diameter of the full moon - and
different parts of it are known as the 
"<a href="ap950718.html">Cygnus Loop</a>" and catalog numbers
NGC 6960, NGC 6979, NGC 6992, and NGC 6995.
