This has many advantages.  It is simple in design, it is easy to use, and no graphical applications are neccesary to create it.  It is formatted into the HTML of a web page and that's it!  However, there are some pretty garish colors out there that may be distracting to the user, so be careful!  Certain colors may take away from your content by making the text in the foreground very hard to read.  That is why it is important that it be muted or calm and not be an eyesore or dominate your design.<BR><BR><BR><BR><HR SIZE="5"><CENTER><A HREF="16.htm"><IMG BORDER=0 SRC="images/GNSIprev.gif" ALT="[prev]" ></A><A HREF="17.htm"><IMG BORDER=0 SRC="images/GNSInext.gif" ALT="[next]" ></A></CENTER><BR><CENTER><FONT size=-1>Content by <A HREF="http://160.111.87.10:591/FMPro?-db=staff&-format=entomology%2fstaff%2fdetail.html&-lay=detail&-sortfield=last&last=thompson&organization=USDA&position=starts%20with&-lop=or&-max=10&-recid=32769&-find=">F.
