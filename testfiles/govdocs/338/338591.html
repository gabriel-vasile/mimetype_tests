Roland Petersen was born in Endelave, Denmark in 1926.  He studied at University of California

at Berkeley, San Francisco Art Institute, California College of Arts and Crafts, Atelier 17 (with

Stanley Hayter), Islington Studio, London, The Print Workshop, London, and The Hans

Hofmann School.  He taught painting at Washington State University, printmaking at UC

Berkeley, and painting and printmaking at UC Davis.  He won a Guggenheim fellow and a

Fullbright fellow.</p>



<p>  Petersen has a very distinctive and recognizable style of printmaking.  He works in color

intaglio, which is a category of printmaking techniques including etching, drypoint and

engraving.  Intaglio means that the image is incised into the plate. Petersen uses this technique to

achieve a variety of textures within each image, as well as multiple colors.  The colors are bright

and garish, and the effect of many of his prints is that of a photo negative, or an infrared photo. 

He makes use of patterns to throw the untextured areas into higher relief, for patterning reduces

the intensity of color, much like newspaper photographs employ different densities of black dots

to form a grayscale image.  Petersen also uses complementary colors to set off forms.  He tends

to abstract the forms, and reduce them to geometric shapes, however they are usually still

recognizable.  There is a slight hint of influence from Oriental woodcuts, especially in <i>Shasta

Dam--A Reflective Image</i>.  This influence can be seen in the off center focus on the

mountain,

and the open, clear sky background.   Petersen often used heavy, hard outlines around the objects

in his prints, which makes the prints feel more like woodcuts than intaglio.   The outlines also

give the print a sense of collage or patchwork.
