<P>The Globe Building is part of a collection of turn-of-the-century
commercial buildings located just north of Pioneer Square and referred
to as the First Avenue Groups.  In 1980, the Seattle Office of Urban
Conservation prepared a National Register nomination for the First
Avenue Groups which provided the following physical description of the
Globe Building's street-facing elevations:</P>

<P>The First Avenue facade is organized into three vertically ascending
layers consisting of a continuous ground floor storefront zone, a two
story body and an arcaded upper story.  The storefront zone consists of
large display windows and clerestories, many of which have been
cosmetically altered with garish signage and other reversible
accretions.  Masonry walls above the storefronts are supported by a
series of slender iron columns and horizontal girders encased within a
terra cotta entablature.  The walls are faced in tan-colored press brick
and are penetrated by pairs of double hung windows at the second and
third stories, and a nearly continuous arcade of round arched windows at
the fourth story.  Neo-classical detailing executed in ivory-colored
terra cotta includes corner quoins, bracketed lintels above the second
story windows, segmented flat arches above the third story windows and a
terminating cornice detailed with an egg and dart motif.  An arched
entrance canopy, four iron balconies and a small roofline pediment
originally incorporated at the center of the First Avenue facade no
longer remain.</P>

<P>The Madison Street facade incorporates similar fenestration and
detailing.  The wall plane of this facade is interrupted at the center
where a slight recess occurs beneath an elliptical terra cotta arch. The
recess appears to have originally opened into an internal light court,
which has since been enclosed.  The wall surface now contains unadorned
double hung windows.  Openings at the basement level of this facade
relate to the Arlington Garage, which occupied the lower floors of the
building several decades after the building's initial construction.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#AB955B"> <B>Historical Significance</B> </FONT></P>

<P>The First Avenue Groups National Register nomination indicates that
the Globe Building was "constructed for developer J. W. Clise in 1901,
and was originally occupied by retail stores, offices, and presumably
lodgings." [<A HREF="hrsend.htm#639">39</A>] This nomination indicates
that the Globe Building, along with the Grand Pacific Hotel, housed the
influx of transient laborers that arrived with the gold rush.</P>

<P>Among the offices housed in the Globe Building were two businesses
associated with  ties to the Far North that Seattle established during
the Klondike Gold Rush.  From 1903 until 1912, the offices of the Alaska
Gold Standard Mining Co. were located in the Globe Building.  Seattle's
fascination with the Far North culminated in 1909 with the Alaska Yukon
Pacific Exposition.  From 1908 until 1909, the Treasurer's Office for
this noteworthy event was housed in the Globe Building. [<A
HREF="hrsend.htm#640">40</A>] Today, this building houses the Alexis
Hotel.</P>
