<p><font SIZE="2" face="Arial">EROS ASTEROID MAY HAVE BEEN PRESENT AT THE BIRTH
OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM</font></p>
</b>
<p><font SIZE="2" face="Arial">The Eros asteroid could have witnessed the
formation of the Earth, according to a preliminary analysis of its surface
composition using NASA's Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) spacecraft.
Analysis of solar X-rays from Eros' surface indicate that it has a composition
similar to the chondrite meteorites found on Earth, which are believed to be
primordial agglomerations of dust grains from the nebula that became the Sun and
planets.</font></p>
<p><font SIZE="2" face="Arial">&quot;It looks like Eros is one of the most
ancient rocks in the solar system, according to the initial data from
NEAR,&quot; said Dr. Jacob Trombka, NEAR X-ray Gamma-Ray Spectrometer (XGRS)
Science Team Leader at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md.
&quot;Exploring Eros will help us understand how the rocky planets like Earth
formed, so we can learn more about how we came to be.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font SIZE="2" face="Arial">The result will be published in the September 22
issue of the journal Science, as part of a special edition describing the latest
results &gt;from the NEAR-Shoemaker mission.</font></p>
<p><font SIZE="2" face="Arial">X-rays from the Sun strike Eros' surface and
cause elements to fluoresce (to be stimulated, then glow) in specific X-ray
&quot;colors,&quot; invisible to the human eye but detectable by XGRS. This is
similar to the way a black light uses ultraviolet light to make pop-art posters
glow in various garish colors. Each element on Eros glows in unique X-ray
colors, allowing XGRS to build a map of the element distribution at and just
beneath the surface of Eros.</font></p>
<p><font SIZE="2" face="Arial">Discovering the composition of Eros is the key to
unlocking the mystery of its origin. When a forming planet reaches a certain
size, its heat and gravity become sufficient to cause differentiation of its
elements - the planet becomes molten, and heavy elements, like nickel and iron,
tend to sink to the center, while light elements, like silicon and carbon, rise
to the surface. If Eros was composed mostly of light elements, this would
indicate that it was a fragment from near the surface of a larger body. If it
was rich in heavy elements, it would likely have been from the center of a
larger object. However, instead Eros appears to be undifferentiated, like the
chondrite meteorites found on Earth, so it probably never was exposed to much
heat. This implies that it is a very primitive, unprocessed object, probably an
aggregate of smaller objects from the early solar system nebula.</font></p>
<p><font SIZE="2" face="Arial">&quot;The result is preliminary, because we have
only mapped about 20 percent of Eros' surface so far,&quot; said Trombka.
&quot;Also, the X-ray spectrometer only reveals composition right at the
surface, in a layer about the thickness of a human hair. Bombardment by cosmic
rays or micrometeorites could have altered the surface composition.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font SIZE="2" face="Arial">&quot;However, we made the same X-ray
measurements of the Moon during the Apollo missions,&quot; added Trombka.
&quot;The Apollo astronauts took core samples, and the composition of the
samples agreed with our surface map. This gives us confidence that our surface
map of Eros reflects its true composition. Also, later in the mission, when NEAR
makes its closest approach to Eros, our Gamma-ray spectrometer will reveal the
composition down to about five inches beneath the surface. This will let us see
if the composition right at the surface is the same as the interior.&quot;</font></p>
