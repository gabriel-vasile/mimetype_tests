<p><div align="center"><h3>Ratioing and Principal Components</h3></div>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For ratios, let us first try the pair: B4 and B2. To see the ratio image, 
    start with View, then place the cursor on Display Image Control Window and 
    click, which brings up the Thumbnail Image Control window. Some band is entered 
    in the Expression box. You cannot use the black triangle efficiently to enter 
    the ratio, so delete with the cursor the band present (unless it happens to 
    be B4) and in the blank type in B4/B2 (remember, ratioing is division of one 
    band pixel DNs by those of another band, and / is the division operator). 
    Press Apply. The result is a black image. Your first thought is to adjust Contrast (C)
    and/or Brightness (B). Move C to its rightmost position (*8.00) and B to +100. A faint image 
    appears but is hard to work with. Conclusion: not enough range for C. For 
    ratio images, this range needs expansion. Go to the Settings button and move 
    the cursor onto Contrast Range, which becomes highlighted and causes a window 
    to appear to its right. There are a number of different values; the default 
    one is *8.00. Change this to *256.0. This will cause the image control window 
    to automatically close. Reopen it as described above. Now, redo the ratio 
    process, with these new settings. Move the C button to *70 and set the B button 
    to + 50, and Apply. A much improved image is the result. Now, try the ration 
    B4/B1 and adjust the C and B buttons until you like what you see. *100 and 
    + 40 is OK; you might find better values. Try different ratios and strive 
    to optimize the gray tone expressions. How well can you render B6/B1? Rather 
    weird, eh! But with some meaning. Note the relative "warmth" of the sea versus 
    the sand dunes; the vegetation versus the town. </li>
	
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Making color composites just requires hitting the RGB button on the Thumbnail 
    Image Control button. The new window has the red, green, and blue subwindows 
    as is customary. But the last single ratio value you looked at fills all three 
    Expression boxes. You will need to type in the specific ratios you seek into 
    each box. Then, press Apply. The resulting color image may be garish or gorgeous, 
    depending largely on the C and B values set at entry. Try different values 
    for each ratio pair, each time hitting Apply. Generally, you will find some 
    narrow sets of values that give a pleasing result. Some combos will reveal 
    more than others. Certain end results will probably call attention to particular 
    image features whereas others won't. Experiment. Try different ratios or inverting 
    the bands in a given ratio; also switch ratios and colors. As an example, 
    put B4/B2 in the red box; B7/B5 in the green box, and B1/B3 in the blue. Check 
    with the Ratio discussion in Section 1 for hints as to interpretation. </li>
	
	<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The resulting ratio color composite may or may not be pleasing to the eye and may not have optimum information content. As you no doubt already know from earlier experience in making a color image, the settings of B and C may be critical. We suggest you experiment with different settings of either or both of B and C until you find one that is satisfying. Keep a record of the B and C values, and then try several more combinations.

  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Making PCI images is fairly straightforward. Assuming all bands are entered and active, and 
    you are in PIT (Thumbnail), press on the Image button and then click on the 
    PCA option in the window that drops down. A new window appears that has Create 
    PCI as a command. When you click on it, a large window like the one that appeared 
    as you entered the 7 TM bands, except B1 through B7 is replaced by PC1 through 
    PC7, is displayed. Move your mouse cursor to the Box PC1 and click on Browse. 
    A window that has many directories listed on the right includes 
    "PITimages". (If not, click on Parent Directory button until the list headed by AUTOEXEC is shown and scroll down the listings 
    until "PITimages" appears.) When you click on it, in the box near the bottom 
    labeled Directory, this will appear "./../../../PITimages" (possibly a variant will occur in your system). Below it is a blank box 
    marked File. Type in a file name with extension ".pc1". Here, we will choose 
    "Israel1.pc1". (<b>NOTE: Several of the image sets, such as Israel, are identified in the directory as, for example, Israel.1, etc. When you add .pcl, there is a double dot string. In various computer operations, that is a "no-no" but it doesn't seem to present a problem as used in PIT.)</b> Pressing the keyboard Enter returns you to the 7 PC boxes. Place the cursor 
    in PC1, hit Browse, and repeat the process, this time entering "Israel2.pc2" 
    in the File Box. Do this again for as many Principal Components as you wish, 
    in this case we will proceed through "Israel6.pc6. Then, at the bottom of 
    the 7 list, hit "Create". At the lower left you will see a rapidly moving PC 
    statement giving the percentage of processing at the moment. When this is 
    done, you have formed the PCIs. </li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To see the various PCI images, from the PIT window, click on View and then 
    on Display Image Control Window, which raises the Thumbnail Image Control 
    window. Click on the black triangle button. A list showing the 7 YM Bands appears, 
    but also there is a list below with PC1 through PC6. Click on any one and 
    it will be entered into the Expression box, and displayed by clicking on Apply. 
    Change C and B as you please, to get a well-balanced set of gray tones. To 
    see any other PCI, simply hit the triangle and choose the new PCI image. For 
    our Israel case, PC1 is most like the band images, and is closest to Band 
    3 but initially darker (can adjust with C and B), PC2 emphasizes vegetation 
    (bright), PC3 is largely medium to bright gray (note the interesting ellipse 
    around the airport - probably a road associated with a fence if this is a 
    military field), PC4 and PC6 contain little contrast and are probably low 
    on information, whereas PC5 does have meaningful tonal patterns that seek 
    interpretation. </li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">PCI color composites can present images that have additional information 
    over the single PCI image. While in the Thumbnail Image Control window, click 
    on the RGB button, and the familiar three color outline boxes appear. Using 
    the black triangle by each box, enter the particular PCI image to associate 
    with that color. To display, press Apply. Start with R = PC1, G = PC2, and 
    B = PC3, display through Apply. If the color balance is not satisfactory, 
    repeat, moving the C and B buttons (intuitively) to new values. Keep trying 
    until you find a proper balance (not too much of one color). To acquaint you 
    with the possibilities, try various combinations of PC1, 2, 3, and 5, discarding 
    PC4 and PC6 (or try them if you are curious.)</li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As mentioned in Section 1 (<a href="../Sect1/Sect1_14.html">page 1-14</a>), interpreting PCA products is almost an art. You 
    may learn little more than from natural or false color displays. But, at times 
    certain features that have been missed in those displays may be revealed. 
    Principal Components images have the advantage over band images in that the 
    process of calculating the PCs leads to decorrelation between bands. Recall 
    that the first PC contains most of the spectral information inherent to the 
    scene; proceeding through higher numbered PCs produces images representing 
    progressively less such information. Note that PCI images can be substituted 
    for spectral band images in the classification of imagery. For information on the theory of Principal Components Analysis, consult Appendix C.</li>
<li>You may wish to leave these images and perform another task. To do so, just go to the main menu (top buttons) after closing out any windows relevant to the PC creation. The default image B1 (in this case ISRAEL.1) should appear (if not, then recover in the usual way of clicking on the Image button on the main menu, then on Open. Be advised that the .pcx files you have made will remain in the PITimages folder as additions to the basic files included in that folder. Even after leaving PIT, the next time you start PIT and proceed through the image opening process, you will see the .pcx files listed in addition to PITimages. You might choose to keep them, but many users prefer to eliminate those produced in a training session. There is no Delete command in PIT and your keyboard Delete button doesn't eliminate a highlighted .pcx file. To remove these or any unwanted files you create, you must return to the PITimages folder that is included in the folders for each Section accessed from the CD-ROM (or over the Internet); highlight each folder to be discarded and hit the Delete button. On the other hand, you might desire to retain the PC files. To find them, from the top menu, choose Image-->PCA-->OpenPCI-->Window headed by Enter PCI paths, click on first Browse button and through Parent Directory until AUTOEXEC list comes up. Scroll to PITimages, highlight, double click and the .pcx images will be displayed along with PITimage (the entry to the basic image files). Click on PC1 or the lowest value of x. This enters that file into the first space; repeat sequentially for others you choose to load.</li>
