Rich brought a couple of hand-outs. The write up, 'Good Screen Design' by 
Rothrock and Martz illustrates the bases of good screen design. Rich had gone
through each items in his list, 'iFIX Picture Guidelines'. His major point 
is that pictures should be similar to each other to reduce confusions. The 
'iFIX Picture Guidelines' is attatched below.
<p>   
The picture of the cooling system of the first floor has incorrect map and
we need to correct it.
<p>
We agreed that all the pictures should have either a close button or an
obvious way to make it disappear.
<p>
Someone suggested that all the general items like help, close and other 
buttons should be in a horizontal bar at the top of the picture.
<p> 
When a picture which was generated with different screen resolution than
viewing screen it could mess up the picture. Someone suggested that we can 
use the 'FitToWindow' function to solve this problem.
<p>
New type of power supplies arrived.  Because Mike Kirk is not avaiable we need 
someone to install them into iFIX.
<p>
Andy said Eva will join the iFIX effort for SVX.
<p>
Mark has been working on network hub for iFIX pc's.  All iFIX pc's will be 
hooked up to B0 online network. He also mentioned that Server 3 (iFIX) is 
not on the UPS system, which supplies power until the generator kicks in when 
there is power outage. The Servers 1 and 2 (Utilities) are already hooked up 
to the the UPS system. We think Sever 3 also need to be hooked up to UPS 
system.

Jonathan reviewed trigger inhibits schemes. His transparancies are attached
below. He said subsystem experts may follow Simone's example for trigger 
inhibit signal.

IFIX Picture Guidelines                      11/30/00  RLS

Displays
1.   The background should be light tan for information
  pages and light blue for menus.  Other pale colors may be
  used to denote specific subjects.
2.   Minimize the use of colors, and make them mean
  something.
3.   Simple common shapes will be used to depict equipment.
4.   Select the valve or equipment itself to dive into
  detailed information.
5.   Pipelines passing between pages will be matched in
  color and location.
6.   Avoid garish colors.
7.   Meanings should be assigned to no more than seven to
  nine colors.  If more than the basic three, then a legend
  should be readily available.
  a.   red is alarm
  b.   green is on
  c.   orange is off
8.   Avoid small blue shapes or blue text.
9.   Text should be black (preferred) or white.
10.  Except for acronyms and tag names, text should be upper
  and lower case.
11.  Align rows and columns.
12.  Pictures should not be too busy, at least 70%
  background.
13.  Display information graphically rather than textually
  if possible.
14.  Use simple text fonts, large enough to read easily from
  four feet.
15.  Read the paper Good Screen Design by Rothrock and
  Martz.


Common Items
1.   A small, gray menu button on each page should return to
  the system menu.
2.   A small CDF logo button in the upper left or upper
  right should return to one of the two main menus.
3.   Daughter screens shall have a close button.  It should
  be labeled Close and located in the upper right.
4.   The date and time will be displayed at the upper left
  of each picture.
5.   Each picture should have a large title at the top
  center.
6.   Each picture should have an icon showing that updates
  are being made.


1.   The goals are readability and ease of operation.
2.   Picture hierarchy, storage location, etc. are not
  addressed.
