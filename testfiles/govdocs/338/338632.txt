SCENE	2.

SCENE	ONE MONTH LATER

INTERIOR OF BIG SWEET'S HOUSE
Raw, unpainted lumber with rafters and uprights showing. Furniture whole, but cheap. The decor, garish. Bright-colored calendars and advertisements nailed on walls. Watermelon-pink curtains at the two windows. White iron bedstead
in one corner with clean, starched lace trimmed pillowslips, and a cheap, slazy silk spread. Three kitchen chairs and a cheap wooden rocker with coarse lace antimacassar.

At the rise, it is early night, and Big Sweet is in a loose wrapper arranging her hair for the street. She sings a light song as she dresses, She puts on her street shoes and stockings, adding proudly
a pair of beribboned red garters. A silk dress is laid out on the bed, and she throws off her
wrapper to put it on. But she whiffs under her arms, reaches over over on the window sill and gets her wash cloth and wipes again, dusts herself with talcum, and arranges the dress carefully to go over her head, without wrinkling.

with happy excitement)

Old My Honey done got it out at last!

Big Sweet
(Dress still in her hands) 
What?
