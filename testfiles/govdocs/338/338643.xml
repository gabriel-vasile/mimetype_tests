<abstract>Water quality monitoring is conducted at 26 National Estuarine Research Reserves (NERR) at four locations within or adjacent to the reserve.  The following parameters are collected at least every 30 minutes: water temperature, specific conductivity, salinity, percent saturation, dissolved oxygen concentration, water depth, pH and turbidity.  All water quality data loggers will be deployed from a known depth from the bottom at each site.</abstract>
<purpose>
Research objectives
 
  	Four data loggers are deployed in Jobos Bay. Two are deployed in inner lagoons of the Mar Negro Component and the other two in the Bay of the Jobos Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve. The instruments are suspended from a pole at a distance of 0.3 meters from the bottom at each selected site. Data from stations 9, 10, 19 and 20 are being submitted to the Centralized Data Management Office as part of the System-Wide Monitoring Program. Measurements are taken at thirty-minute intervals for approximately two-week periods. The sites are identified as representative of areas within the reserve and comparable to the sites that may be receiving impact from human activities from surroundings areas or may act as a habitat gradient in the Bay.
	Station number nine (9), the impacted site, collects water quality data in a site associated with runoff from littoral and basin mangrove areas. This sampling station is located in the most inland lagoon, closest to the Thermoelectric Power Plant. It is subjected to runoff, which may include potential oil spill contamination from this industrial facility. Information compiled from historical environmental documents, indicate that station nine (9) was used as a disposal site for residues of the previously operating sugar mill operation, and therefore might have high organic input into the sediments.
	Station number ten (10), located in a mangrove lagoon area towards the southwestern section of Mar Negro is considered the reference or non-impacted site.
	Station number(19) is located over a sea grass bed(Thalassia testudinum) in the inner western part of the bay just northeast of Cayo Colchones. This station is located near the thermal outfall and operating piers of the Aguirre Power Plant Complex, both activities may have significant effects on sea grass communities. This area is exposed to barge standings, sediment re-suspension and oil sills. 
	Station number (20) is located on the eastern inner bay section of the Cayos Caribe cays. This station is just south of the mangrove islets associated with the Reserve's coral reefs. Water streams coming through the coral platform may help characterize water conditions of the main marine currents reaching Jobos Bay, as well as, possible effects of industrial and chemical activities associated with Phillips Core, AES Coal Energy Plant and Pharmaceuticals located just east to this system.

Associated researchers and projects
 
As part of the NERRS System-wide Monitoring Program, monthly samples for nutrients and chlorophyll were conducted from January to December 2004. Nutrient Sampling at Station 9 is conducted using an ISCO sampler, which collects samples every two hours during a twenty-four hour period. Grab samples are also collected in all four YSI monitoring stations. Analysis of the samples is being performed by the Virginia Institute of Marine Science, VIMS, in Virginia.
 
Another project is the water monitoring program for Ammonium, nitrate, nitrite, ortho-phosphate, chlorophyll and pheophytin.  For this, an ISCO 6712 Portable Sampler is used.  The sample is an automatic instrument that can be easily moved from site to site.  Constructed from durable, corrosion-resistant materials, the sampler withstands the hostile environments of industrial and municipal monitoring sites.  It is located at one of our four principal, long-term stations and it is programmed to take samples every two hours.  The samples are collected every month following an established protocol and sent to the Virginia Institute of Marine Sciences Lab for further analysis.
 
 
 
Other remarks/notes
 
A) During year 2004 eight (8) important rainfall events occur that had effects in the measurements of the different parameters of the sondes.  These events occur:
 
1) april 8 to 20 with 172.47mm of rainfall
2) may 20 to 25 with 78.23mm of rainfall
3) august 16 to 29 with 89.66mm of rainfall
4) september 16 to 21 with 164.3mm of rainfall
5) october 5 to 11 with 145.04mm of rainfall
6) october 21 to 23 with 90.68mm of rainfall
7) the most important november 6 to 19 with 564.64mm of rainfall, equal  
   to the mean anual rainfall.
8) december 5 to 7 with 100.58mm of rainfall
 
 
B) There were a few instances at this NERR site where turbidity recorded small negative values (-0001 and -0002). Because turbidity has a range of accuracy of +/-2 NTU, the technician did not edit or deleted these values in any way.

Anomalous/Suspect Data
 
Note: Due to errors in calibration, turbidity data for all sites are considered inadequate.
During this year we had unusual data in many of turbidity readings with negative values between -18 and -0.1 NTU. In the secchi readings taken between the stations 09, 10, 19 and 20 has always been able to read to the bottom.  We attribute these negative values to the proximity of the turbidity sensor to the marine bottom (about six (6) inches from the bottom). Therefore these negative values can be understood as 0 NTU and therefore were not deleted or listed individually here.

Missing Data
 
Stations 19 and 20 are located in areas that receive strong waves. The movement caused by the strong waves caused the sonde to stop taking data during short time periods and sporadically. 
 Stations 9 and 10 are more protected and receive less wave impact.

Additional Description: 
Entry verification
 
The Centralized Data Management Office re-processed all SWMP water data collected from 1995-2002 to include an identifying station code (three letter reserve code, two letter sampling site code and data type code), a four digit year date stamp (mm/dd/yyyy) and a corrected time column (hh:mm).  With the new format, the use of periods to denote deleted or missing data has been abandoned.  Hence, all periods contained in the SWMP water data collected prior 2003 were removed and left blank.
:
 
 	After retrieving and carefully cleaning the data loggers, they are examined to detect any structural damage to the body or to the probes. The DO membrane is checked for ruptures and then replaced if needed. The turbidity probe is examined to assure that no obstruction affects the wiper and that the sensor is clean. Manipulation and observations are registered in the field log for each deployment respectively.
	The YSI is connected to a Pentium IV 3.2 MHz IBM compatible computer and the data is reviewed using the YSI computer program Ecowatch for Windows that accompanies the YSI 6600 data logger. The file is uploaded in two formats, one in YSI PC6000 format and the other in Comma Delimited format, then the file is renamed to have a ".csv" extension. The YSI Ecowatch for Windows program is used to plot the data and delete the pre and post deployment data that are not in range of the other readings.  Notes are made of any unusual data during that deployment.  Files are exported from EcoWatch in a comma-delimited format (CSV) and opened in Microsoft Excel for pre-processing with the EQWin format macro that was developed by the CDMO.  Data files are revised using the EQWinformat.xls macro that: 1) ensure parameters are in the correct order; 2) convert depth in feet to depth in meters; 3) format the data to the correct number of decimal points; 4) inserts an identifying station code; 5) insert a corrected time column; and 6) allows the user to remove any pre- and post-deployment data from the file.  Where deployment overlap occurs between files, the data produced by the newly calibrated sonde is accepted as being the most accurate.  
The pre-processed data are then copied into EQWin where: 1) the station and parameters are verified against the database; 2) the file configurations are checked; 3) the date and time formats are verified; 4) data are checked for duplication; 5) the data are checked for outliers (data outside the acceptable range for the sensors) and outlier reports produced; and 6) graphs are generated.  The reports and graphs are printed and the data reviewed.  Data at the beginning and end of each data record when the instrument was out of the water are deleted.  These data are identified by field notes that document the times of deployment and retrieval and by the sudden change in Specific Conductivity and Depth records.  Data in the remainder of the record are not deleted unless supporting reasons can be documented.  EQWin is also used to generate statistics, view graphs, create customized queries and reports of the data, cross query the water, weather and nutrient data and finally export the data to the CDMO.  
The anomalous data are evaluated to determine whether to flag or delete the suspect data.  Data are flagged if the values are: 1) outside the range expected for the site (see Site Location and Character, Section 5), 2) outside the range of measurements and accuracy established for the sensors (see Section 9), or 3) outside the range established for good water quality conditions (e.g., Turbidity &gt;150 NTU, negative Turbidity, variable DO, or sudden data spikes).  Data outside the acceptable range of water quality for a particular site are investigated for validity based on weather data, field observations, QC checks, data printouts, and instrument diagnostics.  Date are deleted if the anomalies are attributed to: 1) sensor malfunction - if the voltage reading of the sensor is outside the range established for the sensor or the sensor will not calibrate, 2) exposure of sensors during low tide - identified by unusual Depth, Temperature, and Specific Conductivity data, or 3) fouling of sensors by aquatic organisms, debris or sediment - detected by comparing in situ sensor with measurements (see Section 4).  Turbidity readings &gt; 900 NTU are deleted.  In addition, sensor readings that differ significantly (&gt;10%) from standard solutions (e.g., Conductivity) suggest that the sensor was fouled during deployment.  After corrections are made to the pre-processed data in Excel, it is imported into the EQWin database and text files are submitted to the CDMO.  All raw .csv files are also sent to the CDMO via FTP for archival.  The data is stored in Zip and CD disks. The person responsible for the data QA/QC is Luis A. Encarnaci&#xF3;n.

Site location and character
 
 
 	The Jobos Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve (JBNERR) is located on the southern coastal plain of the island of Puerto Rico, a reserve within the West Indies geographical area. JBNERR is composed of two major areas: (1) Mar Negro, located on the western margin of the Bay, and (2) Cayos Caribe, a chain of 15 tear-shaped islets located to the southeast. The Mar Negro area comprises the bulk of the Reserve, and consists of mangrove forests and a complex system of lagoons and channels interspersed with salt and mud flats.  Coral reefs and sea grass beds, with small beach deposits and upland areas fringe Cayos Caribe mangrove islands.
 	Station 9 is an impacted site and is located on the northeastern section of the Mar Negro component. This sampling station is associated with mangrove lagoon areas and receives runoff from mudflats, the Thermoelectric Power Plant, and adjacent areas. The tidal range varies from 12 to 14 inches near the monitoring station. The salinity at the vicinity of the monitoring station varies from 26.0 ppt to 41.1 ppt. The average depth at station 09 is 1 meter. The bottom is covered by a thick layer of thin sediments with a high content of organic material. Brown and green algae are also present at this site, but a better assessment is needed. The station pole is located at 17&#xB0; 56' 36.8" N and 66&#xB0; 14' 18.5" W.  Fresh water input to the station comes only from runoff and rain.  There is not any direct source of fresh water.
 
 	Station 10 is located in a mangrove lagoon not impacted directly by any upland or marine activities. It provides a reference for comparison of data obtained in other stations, especially to the station in Mar Negro lagoon.  The tidal range varies from 12 to 14 inches. The salinity at the vicinity of the monitoring station varies from 27.0 ppt to 41.7 ppt. The average depth at station 10 is 1 meter. The bottom is covered with a layer of fine sediments with organic material, followed by a layer of calcareous material mainly from shells and oysters. At this site, we can find sea grass (Thalassia), calcareous algae (Halimeda sp.), green algae (Caulerpa sp.) and brown algae (Dictyota sp.) among others. The pole is located at 17&#xB0; 56' 20.3" N and 66&#xB0; 45' 26.7" W. Fresh water input to the station comes only from runoff and rain.  There is not any direct source of fresh water.
 
 	Station 19 is located on the western inner section of the bay at a distance of 233 meters from Cayo Colchones Mangroves over sea grass beds (Thallasia testudinum). Tidal ranges in this area vary from 12 to 14 inches. The salinity at the vicinity of the monitoring station varies from 30.0 ppt to 36.0 ppt. The average depth at this station is of 2 meters. The YSI' sonde is deployed at about 1 foot from the bottom. The bottom is of sandy composition. Sea grass, algae, echinoderms and other related organisms could be found in the area. The pole is located at 17&#xB0; 56' 28.15885" N and 66&#xB0; 13' 45.28784" W.  There is no freshwater input to this area.
 
	Station 20 is located in the inner eastern section at about 190 meters of Cayos Caribe Mangrove islets and at about 688 meters from the coral reef barrier. This station is the closest to Mar Caribe. It has a sandy bottom, with calcareous and coral fragments, sea grass (Thalassia) communities, echinoderms and other associated organisms.  Tidal ranges in this area vary from 12 to 14 inches. The salinity at the vicinity of the monitoring station varies from 30.0 ppt to 36.0 ppt. The average depth of the site is 2 meters. There is no freshwater input to this area. The pole is located at 17&#xB0; 55' 49.14258" N and 66&#xB0; 12' 41.29771" W.
 
  	Data from stations 9, 10, 19 and 20 is being submitted to the CDMO. Eight sondes are permanently devoted to taking readings from these four sites, to assure continuous readings while sondes are taken out of the water for data upload and maintenance. This will avoid data gaps for the stations between sonde maintenance procedures. All monitoring is considered long term.

The reliability of the dissolved oxygen (DO) data after 96 hours post-deployment for non-EDS (Extended Deployment System) data sondes may be problematic due to fouling which forms on the DO probe membrane during some deployments(Wenner et al. 200*).  Many reserves have upgraded to YSI 6600 EDS data sondes, which increase DO accuracy and longevity by reducing the environmental effects of fouling.  The user is therefore advised to consult the metadata and to exercise caution when utilizing the DO data beyond the initial 96-hour time period.  However, this potential drift is not always problematic for some uses of the data, ie. periodicity analysis. It should be noted that the amount of fouling is site specific and that not all data are affected.  The Research Coordinator at the specific NERR site should be contacted concerning the reliability of the DO data because of the site and seasonal variation in the fouling of the DO sensor. All data sondes used at JBNERR sites in 2004 were non-EDS models.
 
The NERRS System-Wide Monitoring Program utilizes YSI data sondes that can be equipped with either depth or water level sensors.  Both sensors measure water depth, but by convention, level sensors refer to atmospherically vented measurements and depth refers to non-vented measurements.  Standard calibration protocols for the non-vented sensor use the atmosphere pressure at the time of calibration.  Therefore, changes in atmospheric pressure between calibrations appear as changes in water depth.  The error is equal to approximately 1.03 cm for every 1millibar change in atmospheric pressure.  This error is eliminated for level sensors because they are vented to the atmosphere throughout the deployment time interval.  If proper atmospheric pressure data are available, non-vented sensor depth measurements can be corrected for deployments between calibrations. Readings for both vented and non-vented sensors are automatically compensated for water density changes due to variations in temperature and salinity.  The Research Coordinator at the specific NERR site should be contacted in order to obtain information regarding atmospheric pressure data availability. All data sondes used at the JBNERR sites in 2004 were non-vented models.
