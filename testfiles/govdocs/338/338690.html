<P><B><I>Awned and awnless near-isogenic durum wheat lines.</I></B></P>

<P>V. Vallega and J.M. Clarke.</P>

<P>Eight pairs of NILs of durum wheat with different degrees of awnedness
were developed from crosses between an awnless accession of <I>T. turgidum</I>
var. <I>dicoccum</I> (PI 355491) and the semidwarf durum wheat cultivars
Valriccardo and Aldura. Each pair comprises an awnless, awnletted, or apically
awnletted isoline and either a short-awned (30-60 mm) or long-awned (80-110
mm) isoline. Five of these pairs are of semidwarf stature, and three are
medium tall (about 110 cm). Threshability ranges from 80 to 100 %.</P>

<P>Seed from F8 plants of each of the isolines was deposited at the USDA-ARS
Small Grains Collection (Aberdeen, ID, USA) and assigned PI numbers from
596597 to 596612. Preliminary observations on these isolines indicate that
the absence of awns is associated with lower kernel weight, test weight,
and grain yield in the semidwarf pairs, but not in the tall ones.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><I>Genes for awnlessness transferred from Triticum dicoccum to Triticum
durum.</I></B></P>

<P>V. Vallega.</P>

<P>The modern cultivars of common wheat are either awned or awnless, whereas
those of durum wheat are all awned. In 1987, a small program was initiated
to develop agronomically acceptable awnless durum wheat lines to be used
for study purposes and as possible parents in breeding programs. Crosses
were made between an awnless accession (PI 355491) of <I>T. turgidum</I>
var. <I>dicoccum </I>and various Italian semidwarf durum wheat cultivars.
Subsequently, the offspring were selected for awnlessness, free-threshing
ability, and lodging resistance.</P>

<P>As a result of the program, 16 completely awnless lines were developed.
Twelve of these lines (now in F10) are semidwarf, and four are medium-tall.
Given the small size of the program and the 'primitive' nature of the awnless
parent, each of the lines developed has one or more obvious defects as expected,
including low kernel weight, low test weight, and/or late maturity. Therefore,
a new cycle of crosses especially oriented to enhance kernel weight will
be initiated.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><I>Development of further pair of durum wheat lines near-isogenic
for glaucousness.</I></B></P>

<P>V. Vallega and J.M. Clarke.</P>

<P>Another pair of NILs, PI593000 (glaucous) and PI593001 (nonglaucous),
was developed. The lines were obtained from the cross 'Valgerardo / Trinakria'
by maintenance of heterozygosity for glaucousness (waxy bloom on upper leaves,
peduncle, and spike) in the F4 through the F13 generations, followed by
selection of homozygous glaucous and nonglaucous lines. The lines are of
semidwarf stature and very early heading. The original cross was made by
G. Zitelli.</P>

<P>Seed of the isolines was deposited at the Small Grains Collection (Aberdeen,
ID, USA). This near-isogenic pair and seven others developed in the past
few years (Clarke et al. 1995) will be useful for studying the effects of
glaucousness on the agrobiological performance of T. durum.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><I>Development of a partially free-threshing bulk population of Triticum
monococcum.</I></B></P>

<P>V. Vallega.</P>

<P>The diploid wheat <I>T. monococcum</I>, often viewed as merely a source
of useful genes, may still play a role in modern agriculture as a crop in
itself. MONOC BULK 1 VV (PI584654) represents a first, tentative step towards
the development of commercial cultivars of <I>T. monococcum</I>. The line
is a bulk of equal quantities of seed from 34 F5 lines of <I>T. monococcum</I>
var. <I>sinskajae</I> selected from a cross between WIR 48993 (a soft-glumed,
partially free-threshing line) and VV 307 (a tenacious-glumed accession).
The bulked population, was selected for soft glumes, early maturity, and
agronomic type using the classical pedigree method.</P>

<P>In order to obtain competitive diploid wheats, selections from the bulk
should be crossed with diploid wheat accessions having greater gluten strength,
as well as shorter and stronger straw.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><I>Introgression of friabilin gene into durum wheat by allosyndesis.</I></B></P>

<P>A. Niglio, A. Gallelli, L. Gazza, and N.E. Pogna.</P>

<P>Kernel hardness strongly affects flour yield after milling, starch damage,
and water absorption of dough. The genetic basis of grain hardness/softness
is relatively well known. The major locus <I>Ha</I>, which controls this
character, is on the short arm of chromosome 5D and is present in two allelic
forms (<I>Ha</I>/<I>ha</I> soft/hard texiture) in hexaploid wheat, although
it is absent in the tetraploid durum wheat.</P>

<P>Friabilin, which is considered the principal marker of kernel softness,
is a low molecular weight protein (15 KD) localized in bread wheat endosperm
of both hard and soft wheats where it interacts with starch granules. The
strength of this interaction affects the endosperm texture. However, friabilin
has never been found in any varieties of durum wheat so far tested.</P>

<P>Cosegregation studies on NILs for grain hardness have strengthened the
idea that friabilin is the genetic product of the <I>Ha</I> locus. In addition,
by PCR analysis with specific primers for the <I>Ha</I> locus, we verified
that the locus is absent in tetraploid durum wheat, although it is present
in both hexaploid wheat and diploid species such as <I>T. monococcum</I>
that express the normal pattern of friabilin. Thus, the absence of friabilin
in durum wheat is not due to regulation of the genetic expression but to
the absence of the relative gene.</P>

<P>Our work hopes to transfer the friabilin gene into durum wheat in order
to produce durum wheat genotypes with increased flour yield , reduced starch
damage, and water absorption. The substitution line Langdom 5D(5B) was crossed
with a mutant line of Cappelli with a deletion of the ph gene whose expression
prevents pairing of homoeologous chromosomes.</P>

<P>The resulting F2 seeds have been analyzed for friabilin expression by
Western-immunoblotting and also for IEF pattern of the <I>Ibf-1</I> isozyme.
The latter protein is codified by genes on the long arms of the homoeologous
group 5 chromosomes. In this way, we have selected friabilin-expressing
seeds in the absence of the typical <I>Ibf-1</I> pattern for chromosome
5D. The progeny of these plants currently is being investigated for chromosome
constitution and quality characteristics.</P>

<P><B><I>Production of bread wheat genotypes lacking the Gli-1 and Gli-2
loci.</I></B></P>

<P>*Istituto Superiore di Sanit&agrave;, Rome, Italy.</P>

<P>Coeliac disease is a gluten-sensitive enteropathy that occurs in genetically
predisposed individuals. The toxicity of wheat flour results from the presence
of alcohol-soluble proteins. Earlier studies showed that alpha-gliadins
are much more toxic than the beta-, gamma-, and omega-gliadins.</P>

<P>To determine whether the suppression of certain gliadin loci can significantly
reduce bread wheat toxicity in coeliac disease, we crossed the bread wheat
line TM, lacking the <I>Gli-B1</I>, <I>Gli-D1</I>, and <I>Gli-A2</I> loci,
encoding for some alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and omega-gliadins, and the mutant
bread wheat lines 96-250 and 96-252, which lack the <I>Gli-A1</I> and <I>Gli-D2</I>
gliadin loci, respectively.</P>

<P>In the F2 progeny of the cross 'TM / 96-250' novel genotypes lacking
<I>Gli-A1</I> plus the <I>Gli-B1</I>,<I> Gli-D1</I>,<I> </I>or<I> Gli-A2</I>
locus have been selected (<A HREF="ITATAB.html" TARGET="_blank">see Table
1</A>). Furthermore,in the F2 progeny from the cross 'TM / 96-252', two
novel double mutants (<I>Gli-B1/Gli-D2 </I>null and <I>Gli-D1/Gli-D2 </I>null)
and a triple-mutant (<I>Gli-B1/Gli-D1/Gli-D2</I>)<I> </I>were obtained (<A
HREF="ITATAB.html" TARGET="_blank">see Table 2</A>). These mutants currently
are being tested for their toxicity in coeliac disease.<BR>

<P><B><I>Pathogenicity of Puccinia recondita f.sp. tritici in Italy during
1997.</I></B></P>

<P>M. Pasquini, F. Casulli, L. Sereni, and F. Casini.</P>

<P>Wheat is one of the most important crops in Italy covering an area of
2,482,119 ha (ISTAT 1996) of which 63 % is durum wheat and 37 % is bread
wheat. Durum wheat is grown mainly in southern Italy, and bread wheat is
present in the central and northern regions. Wheat yield may be reduced
annually by many fungal diseases, among which leaf rust is the most frequent
and widespread in the Italian cereal growing areas.</P>

<P>Pathogenicity surveys were made during the last wheat growing season
in critical areas of northern, central, and southern Italy. Data were obtained
in the field and in greenhouse on the reactions of durum and bread wheats,
NILs, and new wheat selections.</P>

<P>The climatic conditions of the previous season were not particularly
favorable to disease development. However, leaf rust was present in many
locations. High percentages of infection were observed in northern regions
and in the South (Sicily). Genes <I>Lr2b</I>, <I>Lr9</I>, <I>Lr19</I>, <I>Lr24</I>,
and <I>Lr29</I> were effective in all the locations where NILs with these
genes were grown. These genes were effective to all the isolates identified
in greenhouse tests. Other genes, such as <I>Lr13</I>, <I>Lr22a</I>, and
<I>Lr35</I> that condition adult plant resistance, were effective against
the natural pathogen populations present in all the locations.</P>

<P>Genes <I>Lr1</I>, <I>Lr2a</I>, <I>Lr15</I>, <I>Lr17</I>, <I>Lr26</I>,
and <I>Lr28</I> were effective in controlling the disease in central and
southern Italy but not in the north. Wheat lines with the resistance genes
<I>Lr3</I>, <I>Lr3ka</I>, and <I>Lr23</I> were susceptible in northern and
central Italy but not in the south. The resistance genes <I>Lr14b</I>, <I>Lr21</I>,
<I>Lr32</I>, <I>Lr38</I>, and <I>Lr44</I> were most effective in central
and southern Italy.</P>

<P>In 1997, we confirmed that the leaf rust population present in northern
Italy appears more complex and different from that present in south, as
previously observed, and is probably due to the selection pressure provided
by the wheat species and varieties cultivated in these areas.</P>

<P><B><I>Durum wheat: identification of genes for resistance to fungal diseases
from local or alternative sources.</I></B></P>

<P>M. Pasquini, L. Sereni, F. Casini, and P. Cacciatori.</P>

<P>The present work aims to broaden the genetic variability of cultivated
durum wheats in order to protect the crop population from pathogens with
minimal environmental impact and for a more effective use of energy. The
detection and valorization of local germplasm from Mediterranean regions
and the utilization of alien sources (<I>T. dicoccoides</I>) of resistance
genes have been considered.</P>

<P>Thirty-seven durum wheat genotypes from different Mediterranean countries
were analyzed for their resistance to <I>Blumeria graminis</I> isolates,
widespread on wheat in Italy. Some of these lines had moderate resistance
to powdery mildew. The genotypes Sert 217/1, Cham 3, Duramba, FG17980, Gerardo
518, Jordan Col.86-172, M33, Roqueno, Sabil 1, and TE8304 (kindly supplied
by ICARDA) were the most resistant. We are now making pathological, agronomical,
and genetical analyses on this material.</P>

<P>A systematic and careful screening for resistance to different fungal
diseases has been made in<I>T. dicoccoides</I> accessions from different
areas in Israel. This species seems to be a good source of resistance genes
especially to powdery mildew, other fungal diseases and abiotic stress and
has interesting agronomic and qualitative characters. New wheat selections
were obtained by crossing some of these <I>T. dicoccoides</I> accessions
with Italian durum wheat genotypes. The most interesting lines from these
crosses were grown in replicated plots and tested for their phytopathological,
biochemical, and agronomical traits. Selection was made in order to identify
improved types with combined resistance to both mildew and stem rust (derived
from the durum wheats parents), good agronomic traits, and good quality
characteristics. The most promising lines were backcrossed to their durum
parent. During the selection process, the transfer of the high grain protein
content present in the <I>T. dicoccoides</I> accessions also is being monitored.</P>

<P><B><I>Reactions of cultivars of common wheat to wheat soilborne mosaic
virus.</I></B></P>

<P>WSBMV is widespread in Italy, especially in the northern and central
regions of the country. Yield losses of about 50 % have been recorded on
susceptible common wheat cultivars. The only economically viable means of
controlling this virus is growing WSBMV-resistant genotypes, yet little
is known about the reactions of the common wheat cultivars presently grown
in Italy. During 1995-96, we grew 36 such cultivars in a severely WSBMV-infested
field near Bologna. Each cultivar was grown in 10 m2 plots distributed in
the field according to a randomized block design with three replicates.
Resistance to WSBMV was evaluated on the basis of DAS-ELISA readings, symptom
severity (on a 0-4 scale) and agronomic performance. Symptom severity (mean
score = 0.7; range = 0.0-2.3) and ELISA values (mean = 0.882) were relatively
low, especially if compared to those observed on 33 durum wheats grown in
an adjacent field. Nine of the common wheat cultivars analyzed remained
asymptomatic throughout the entire season, and four of these (Francia, Mol,
Santerno, and Tremie) also were devoid of the causal agent, at least according
to the ELISA and ISEM tests performed. Simple correlation coefficients among
agronomic data, ELISA values, and symptom scores were significant in most
cases (Table 1). Regression analysis indicated that the common wheat cultivars
presenting the highest ELISA values and / or the highest disease scores
suffered grain losses attributable to WSBMV between 29 and 36 %, and that
in such cultivars mean kernel weight was reduced by about 25 %.</P>

<P>In Italy, WSBMV causes severe economic losses on both common and durum
wheat crops. Yield losses of about 70 % have been recorded on susceptible
durum wheat cultivars. During 1995-96, we assayed the reactions to WSBMV
of 33 durum wheat cultivars in a severely WSBMV-infested field situated
near Bologna. Each cultivar was grown in a 10 m2 plot distributed in the
field according to a randomized block design with three replicates. Resistance
to WSBMV was evaluated on the basis of DAS-ELISA readings, symptom severity
(on a 0-4 scale), and agronomic performance. Symptom severity (mean score
= 1.3; range = 0.0-3.8) and ELISA values (mean = 1.207) were moderately
high. The highest grain yields were recorded for the cultivar Ares. This
cultivar remained asymptomatic throughout the entire season and also devoid
of the causal agent, at least according to the ELISA and ISEM tests performed.
Simple correlation coefficients among agronomic data, ELISA values, and
symptom scores were relatively high and statistically significant (Table
2). Regression analysis indicated that the cultivars presenting the highest
disease scores (i.e., Granizo, Cirillo, Agridur, etc.) suffered grain losses
attributable to WSBMV of about 45 %. In these cultivars, test weight was
reduced by about 5 kg/hl, mean kernel weight by about 25 %, and plant height
by about 20 cm.</P>
