<b>VERNONIA <BR>
</B><I>Vernonia anthelmintica</I> (L.) Willd., family Compositae


<P>The seeds of vernonia are of current interest because they are the source
of an oil containing vernolic acid (Higgins 1968, Krewson et al. 1962).
Yield and related results have recently been obtained (Berry et al. 1970,
Lessman and Berry 1967, Massey 1969). However, not too much attention was
given to the pollination requirements. </P>

<P>Later, through the use of flower color as a genetic marker, Berry and
Lessman (1969) noted cross-pollination in open plots. Berry et al. (1970)
reported 13 percent outcrossing and noted an abundance of bees. They considered
the plant to be essentially self-pollinated. </P>

<P>If this crop is to come into commercial production, more careful and
extended studies of its pollination requirement should be made. </P>
