<P>INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES</P>

<P>Drug use among the Nation's school children poses a grave threat not
only to the lives of individual students and their families, but to the
health of the Nation itself. The Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities
Act of 1994, 20 U.S.C. 7101 et seq., authorizes federal grants to local
educational agencies for drug and violence prevention programs, including
programs like the one at issue here, designed &quot;to combat illegal alcohol,
tobacco and drug use.&quot; 20 U.S.C. 7116(b)(2)(C).1 The United States,
primarily through the Department of Justice and Department of Health and
Human Services, administers numerous other programs that seek to deter illegal
drug use, particularly among youth. The United States participated as an
amicus in Vernonia School District 47J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646 (1995), which
involved a challenge to a school district's random drug-testing policy for
student athletes.</P>

<P>STATEMENT</P>

<P>1. Illegal drug use remains prevalent among the Nation's school children.
In a survey conducted last year, 54% of 12th grade students and 45.6% of
10th grade students from 435 schools across America reported they had used
an illegal drug during their lifetime. Public Health Service, Nat'l Institutes
of Health, Monitoring the Future: Nat'l Results on Adolescent Drug Use Table
1 (2000). In the same survey, 24.9% of 12th grade students and 22.5% of
10th grade students said that they had used an illicit drug at least once
in the past month. Id. Table 2; see Centers for Disease Control, Youth Risk
Behavior Surveillance-United States, 1999, 49 Morbidity and Mortality Weekly
Report 14 (June 9, 2000) (Youth Risk Behavior) (In 1999, 47.2% of high school
students nationwide reported that they had used marijuana, and 26.7% of
such students did so one or more times during the prior 30 days); Pet. App.
28a-29a n.2.2</P>

<P>At the same time, school children not only are more vulnerable to drug
use than adults, but such abuse is much more likely to devastate their lives.
Office of Nat'l Drug Control Policy, Nat'l Drug Control Strategy: 2001 Annual
Report 10. Children who abuse drugs risk serious physical and psychological
harm, as well as death. Ibid. They are less likely to achieve success in
the classroom, and more apt to engage in criminal and other high-risk behavior,
including driving while impaired and engaging in sexual acts that may result
in unintended pregnancies or the transmission of disease. Id. at 10, 13.
Drug use also has contributed to the rise in youth violence. Office of Applied
Studies, Substance Abuse &amp; Mental Health Services Admin., Nat'l Household
Survey on Drug Abuse Report 2 (Nov. 9, 2001).</P>

<P>2. a. Tecumseh, Oklahoma, is a rural community about 40 miles southeast
of Oklahoma City. Petitioners (collectively, the &quot;school district&quot;)
are a public school district in Tecumseh and its governing board of education.
The school district administers Tecumseh High School, which has about 750
students in grades 9 through 12, as well as a middle school and elementary
schools. Tecumseh High is a member of the Oklahoma Schools Secondary Activities
Association (OSSAA), which sponsors and regulates competitions among public
school students from across the State. Most Tecumseh students participate
in extracurricular activities governed by the OSSAA, including not only
sports but also cheerleading, band, choir, color guard, Pom Pom, Future
Homemakers of America (FHA), Future Farmers of America (FFA), and the academic
team. Pet. App. 2a-3a.</P>

<P>b. Like virtually every community in America, Tecumseh has experienced
illicit drug use among its school children. The record in this case provides
direct testimonial and other evidence of such abuse. For example, a school
board president testified that marijuana use has been reported in the classroom
at Tecumseh High. J.A. 96. Three teachers testified that they heard students
talking about marijuana use, J.A. 115-116, 120-121; that they suspected
that several students in their classes were abusing drugs, J.A. 119, 120,
125; and that they had reported students for drug use, J.A. 120, 127. Pet.
App. 57a-58a &amp; nn. 12-13.</P>

<P>Students too-including respondents themselves-have acknowledged drug
use in Tecumseh schools. Lindsay Earls stated during a nationally televised
program that there is &quot;a widespread drug problem&quot; at Tecumseh
High. Pet. App. 58a n.14. Daniel James testified that he has seen &quot;about
twelve&quot; students under the influence of illegal drugs, is aware of
others who have abused such drugs, and knows of students who have entered
drug rehabilitation programs. J.A. 122-124. In addition, school counselors
met with students to discuss drug use more than 40 times between 1997 and
2000, J.A. 52-56, and drug dogs &quot;hit&quot; on students or their vehicles
several times between 1997 and 1999. C.A. App. 633-636, 640-642, 644-646,
649-650; see J.A. 58-59.</P>

<P>Those reports of drug use include incidents involving students who participate
in competitive activities governed by the OSSAA. For example, a voice teacher
testified that she has had students tell her about drug use among students
in the choir, and has observed choir students who appeared to be impaired.
J.A. 125-126. An FHA supervisor testified that students talk freely in class
about marijuana use. J.A. 115. School counselors have reported several instances
of drug use among band members, and other incidents of drug use among students
in vocal. J.A. 52-56. An FFA supervisor testified that he has suspected
drug use among members of FFA, and has overheard students discuss drug use.
C.A. App. 204-205. In addition, students enrolled in sports, FFA, band,
and vocal have been caught with or disciplined for drugs. J.A. 44; see also
J.A. 78, 81, 99, 101, 105.</P>

<P>c. The community has tried to deter drug use in a number of different
ways. For example, the school district has observed &quot;Red Ribbon Week&quot;
each year, during which anti-drug rallies are held and students are urged
to pledge to remain drug-free. The school district participates in a &quot;Grim
Reaper&quot; program designed to inform students about the perils of drug
use. The school district has stepped up surveillance activities, and uses
drug dogs to sweep school property. Pet. App. 59a n.20. In addition, since
at least 1995, the school district has considered implementing a student
drug-testing policy, as an added deterrent. C.A. App. 123.</P>

<P>In 1998, discussions over whether to enact such a policy intensified
as &quot;people all over the community&quot; began to become more &quot;aware&quot;
of a drug problem at Tecumseh High. Pet. App. 58a; C.A. App. 123-125; J.A.
85. After a February 1998 school board meeting at which a parent admitted
her own child's drug use, J.A. 86, marijuana was found hidden in the school
parking lot and in a student's car, J.A. 101-103, 140. In August 1998, after
receiving more calls for action, the school district convened a special
community meeting at which a proposed drug-testing policy was discussed.
J.A. 137-139. No one who attended that meeting was reported to have objected
to suspicionless drug-testing of school children. C.A. App. 78. Shortly
thereafter, the school district adopted the drug-testing policy at issue
in this case.</P>

<P>d. The policy applies to all students who participate in interscholastic
competitions governed by the OSSAA, including both athletic and non-athletic
activities. J.A. 193. Before a student is allowed to enroll in such an activity,
he must return a consent form signed by him, his parent, and his coach,
agreeing to be bound by the policy. J.A. 203-204. The policy authorizes
three forms of urinalysis testing for illegal drugs. First, all students
are tested as part of the annual physical examination required for a sport
or, for non-athletes, before participation in OSSAA competitions. Second,
random tests are conducted each month based on names drawn from the pool
of all students covered by the policy. Third, any covered student who is
suspected of drug use may be tested at any time. J.A. 196-197.</P>

<P>During tests, students are accompanied into a restroom by an adult monitor
of the same sex and asked to provide a urine sample from behind a &quot;closed
stall.&quot; J.A. 198. Monitors examine the specimen for temperature and
tampering, and give students a form on which the student may list any medications
being taken. School district employees &quot;shall not&quot; view that list.
J.A. 199. The specimen and medication list are sent to an independent laboratory,
which tests for amphetamines, cannaboid metabolites, cocaine, opiates, barbituates,
and benzodiazepines. An initial &quot;positive&quot; may be reported only
if it is confirmed by a second test using the gas chromatography/mass spectrometry
technique. Ibid.</P>

<P>Positive test results are disclosed only to the parent, student, principal,
and coach, and not to law enforcement. A first offense results in drug counseling
and another drug test in two weeks, but the student may continue to participate
in OSSAA-governed activities. Students who test positive a second time are
suspended from OSSAA activities for two weeks, and must agree to drug counseling
and random drug tests for the rest of the year. A third strike, or any refusal
to submit to a drug test, bars the student from OSSAA activities for the
remainder of the school year. J.A. 201-202. Students may appeal test results
to the superintendent and continue to participate in OSSAA activities. J.A.
200. No suspensions from school or academic sanctions may be imposed for
violating the policy. J.A. 193.3</P>

<P>3. In 1999, respondents, Tecumseh High students who desire to participate
in non-athletic interscholastic competitions governed by the school district's
policy, brought this Section 1983 action seeking declaratory and injunctive
relief from enforcement of the policy on the ground that it violates the
Fourth Amendment.4 On cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court
granted summary judgment for the school district. Pet. App. 50a-81a. Following
the same &quot;special needs&quot; analysis applied in Vernonia School District
47J v. Acton, supra, the court held that the school district has shown a
&quot;legitimate cause for concern&quot; (Pet. App. 61a) to justify its
policy, and that the school district's need outweighs the diminished expectations
of privacy that students have in the public school setting, particularly
given the &quot;minimal&quot; intrusion involved in testing. Id. at 78a.</P>

<P>4. The court of appeals reversed. Pet. App. 1a-45a. The court agreed
that this case is governed by the &quot;analysis in Vernonia,&quot; but
it held that a different result was required than in Vernonia. Id. at 9a.
The court of appeals recognized &quot;that, like athletes, participants
in other extracurricular activities have a somewhat lesser privacy expectation
than other students.&quot; Id. at 21a. In addition, the court recognized
that the character of the intrusion in this case is &quot;virtually identical&quot;
to that in Vernonia, because of the similarities in the testing process
under both policies. Id. at 22a. However, the court held that, unlike Vernonia,
the nature and immediacy of the government concern at issue here &quot;tips
the balancing analysis decidedly in favor of [respondents].&quot; Ibid.
In particular, the court faulted the evidence of the underlying drug problem
in this case. Id. at 14a-18a.</P>

<P>Judge Ebel dissented. Pet. App. 28a-45a. He would have upheld the school
district's policy under Vernonia. In his view, &quot;Vernonia does not require
that a school district allow illegal drugs to gain a stronghold among its
schoolchildren before it may take steps to eliminate them through random
drug testing.&quot; Id. at 38a. As he explained, &quot;[i]llegal drugs *
* * are nearly impossible to eliminate once they have garnered a foothold
in our communities, schools, and homes.&quot; Id. at 38a-39a. Further, Judge
Ebel reasoned that the evidence of drug use in this case was comparable
to that in Vernonia. Id. at 38a. Judge Ebel also concluded that &quot;the
majority place[d] too little weight on the fact that the testing here is
limited to extracurricular activities, where the students have voluntarily
submitted themselves to additional supervision and regulation.&quot; Id.
at 39a-40a.</P>

<P>SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT</P>

<P>In response to increasing community concern over illicit drug use in
Tecumseh schools, petitioners adopted a random drug-testing policy for all
students who wish to participate in extracurricular interscholastic competitions,
including non-athletic activities. That policy is reasonable, and thus satisfies
the Fourth Amendment, under the same considerations that this Court looked
to in upholding the random drug-testing policy for student athletes in Vernonia
School District 47J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646 (1995).</P>

<P>A. The privacy interests in this case are identical to those in Vernonia.
As Vernonia reaffirmed, privacy interests are greatly diminished in the
public school context. In that regard, the &quot;most significant&quot;
(515 U.S. at 665) consideration identified in Vernonia-that the policy was
adopted by a school district fulfilling its guardianship responsibilities
to its students-is just as forceful here. In addition, as was true with
respect to the student athletes in Vernonia, the already-diminished expectations
of the general study body at Tecumseh High are further diminished with respect
to students who participate in an interscholastic competition covered by
the school district's policy. Students who participate in such activities,
athletic or not, are subject to added academic and conduct requirements.</P>

<P>B. The character of the intrusion complained of in this case is, if anything,
less significant than in Vernonia. The manner of testing, the information
that is obtained, and the uses to which such information is put are the
same here as in Vernonia, except in two respects. The policy here requires
that all students be permitted to provide specimens from behind a &quot;closed
stall,&quot; whereas the policy in Vernonia only required that female students
be permitted to do so. In addition, unlike Vernonia, the policy here expressly
requires that information concerning prescription medications remain confidential.
In Vernonia, this Court characterized the degree of intrusion involved in
testing as &quot;negligible&quot; and &quot;not significant.&quot; 515 U.S.
at 558, 660. It is even less significant here.</P>

<P>C. The court of appeals erred in concluding that the government concern
at issue in this case was insufficient to justify the limited intrusion
into students' diminished privacy interests. As this Court recognized in
Vernonia, the government has a compelling interest in deterring, not just
detecting, drug use among school children. The perils of student drug use
are numerous and well-documented. The court of appeals was wrong to suggest
that the school district's interest is materially different here on the
ground that student athletes face a higher risk of injury from drug use
than students covered by the policy in this case, many of whom face comparable
risks. Quite apart from its interest in minimizing the risk of injury from
drug use, the school district also has a strong interest in ensuring that
those students who represent Tecumseh High and their community at interscholastic
competitive events do so drug-free.</P>

<P>The court of appeals also erred in concluding that the government's concern
was not sufficiently &quot;immediate.&quot; First, this Court's drug-testing
cases make clear that, although a &quot;demonstrated problem of drug abuse&quot;
may &quot;bolster[]&quot; the government's interest, such evidence is &quot;not
in all cases necessary to the validity of a testing regime.&quot; Chandler
v. Miller, 520 U.S. 305, 319 (1997). In that regard, the record in Vernonia
by no means establishes a constitutional floor for justifying a student
drug-testing policy. Second, the record of the drug problem at Tecumseh,
including among students covered by the policy, is much closer to the actual
evidence of drug use in Vernonia than the court of appeals acknowledged.
Third, the court failed to give appropriate deference to the first-hand
judgments of local school administrators as to the severity of the drug
problem and need for action. Fourth, the court failed to appreciate that
deterring drug use so that it does not take root and spread is every bit
as important, if not more so, as detecting drug use at a school that already
has a drug epidemic.</P>

<P>D. Balancing those considerations, the Court should conclude that the
drug-testing policy in this case is reasonable and thus constitutional.
Adopting a different approach would create a standardless inquiry under
which the constitutionality of each school's drug-testing policy would turn
on finely-drawn distinctions over the state of the record of drug use at
that particular school, or among a particular class of students, or whether
a destructive problem is already out of control. There is no reason to invite
such fact-intensive litigation in every case, or to demand a school-specific
inquiry into what is clearly a pervasive national problem. The Court should
leave school administrators with flexibility to adopt common-sense, drug-deterrence
measures like the policy at issue in this case.</P>

<P>ARGUMENT</P>

<P>THE FOURTH AMENDMENT DOES NOT PROHIBIT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT'S RANDOM DRUG-<BR>
TESTING POLICY <BR>
</P>

<P>The Fourth Amendment guarantees &quot;[t]he right of the people to be
secure in their persons * * * against unreasonable searches and seizures.&quot;
The &quot;state-compelled collection and testing of urine&quot; is a &quot;search&quot;
within the Fourth Amendment. Vernonia Sch. Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U.S.
646, 652 (1995). The general rule is that to be reasonable, and thus constitutional,
a search must be based on individualized suspicion of wrongdoing. This Court
has recognized an exception to that rule, however, for searches based on
&quot;special needs, beyond the normal need for law enforcement, mak[ing]
the warrant and probable-cause requirement impracticable.&quot; Id. at 653
(quoting Griffin v. Wisconsin, 483 U.S. 868, 873 (1987)); see National Union
Treasury Employees v. Von Raab, 489 U.S. 656, 666 (1989); Skinner v. Railway
Labor Executives' Ass'n, 489 U.S. 602, 619 (1989).</P>

<P>In Vernonia, this Court reaffirmed that &quot;such 'special needs' *
* * exist in the public school context,&quot; and may justify suspicionless
drug testing of students. 515 U.S. at 653. That case involved a Fourth Amendment
challenge to an Oregon school district's policy, which authorized random
urinalysis tests of student athletes. In deciding whether that policy was
constitutional, the Court considered (1) the nature of the privacy interests
at issue; (2) the character of the intrusion involved; and (3) the nature
and immediacy of the government concern at issue, and the efficacy of the
chosen means for meeting it. Balancing those factors, the Court held that
the policy was &quot;reasonable and hence constitutional.&quot; Id. at 665.
As explained below, a proper balancing of the same considerations leads
to the identical conclusion with respect to the substantially similar policy
at issue in this case.5</P>

<P>A. As In Vernonia, The Privacy Interests Of Students Subject To Testing
Are Greatly Diminished By The School Setting And Activities In Which They
Have Chosen To Participate</P>

<P>1. In Vernonia, this Court emphasized that &quot;[t]he most significant
element&quot; in upholding the challenged drug-testing policy was the nature
of the privacy interests at issue. 515 U.S. at 665. In particular, the Court
stressed &quot;that the Policy was undertaken in furtherance of the government's
responsibilities, under a public school system, as guardian and tutor of
children entrusted to its care.&quot; Ibid.; see Chandler, 520 U.S. at 316
(the public school context was &quot;critical&quot; in Vernonia, because
of the State's guardianship responsibilities to students). The same goes
for the student drug-testing policy in this case and, just as in Vernonia,
that fact weighs heavily in favor of finding that the school district's
policy is constitutional.</P>

<P>Under the Fourth Amendment, an examination of the legitimacy of the privacy
interests at stake must begin with the setting in which the challenged intrusion
arises. &quot;What expectations are legitimate varies * * * with context,
depending, for example, upon whether the individual asserting the privacy
interest is at home, at work, in a car, or in a public park.&quot; Vernonia,
515 U.S. at 654 (citation omitted). The school setting of this case necessarily
affects the legitimate expectations of privacy. See New Jersey v. T.L.O.,
469 U.S. 325, 339 (1985); id. at 348 (Powell, J., joined by O'Connor, J.,
concurring) (&quot;In any realistic sense, students within the school environment
have a lesser expectation of privacy than members of the population generally.&quot;).</P>

<P>As the Court observed in Vernonia: &quot;Central, in our view, to the
present case is the fact that the subjects of the [challenged drug-testing
policy] are (1) children, who (2) have been committed to the temporary custody
of the State as schoolmaster.&quot; 515 U.S. at 654. &quot;[A] public school
system&quot; acts &quot;as guardian and tutor of children entrusted to its
care.&quot; Id. at 665. As a common-sense matter, it must do so. As this
Court has recognized, a &quot;proper educational environment requires close
supervision of schoolchildren, as well as the enforcement of rules against
conduct that would be perfectly permissible if undertaken by an adult.&quot;
Id. at 655 (quoting T.L.O., 469 U.S. at 339); see id. at 680 (O'Connor,
J., dissenting) (&quot;schools have traditionally had special guardianlike
responsibilities for children&quot;). Public schools do not stand in the
same shoes as the parents of the children who fill their classrooms. Id.
at 655. But when children enter the schoolhouse gates, they submit themselves
to the temporary custody and control of their teachers and other school
administrators, and must abide by their rules.</P>

<P>In short, the public school context greatly diminishes the legitimate
expectations of privacy of students from intrusions implicating the Fourth
Amendment. And from that standpoint, the students covered by the drug-testing
policy here have the same diminished expectations as the students covered
by the policy in Vernonia.</P>

<P>2. In Vernonia, the Court observed that the already- diminished privacy
expectations of school children &quot;are even less with regard to student
athletes.&quot; 515 U.S. at 657 (emphasis added). For example, students
who participate in high school athletics typically use communal facilities
such as locker rooms, and may be required to change and shower in each other's
presence. Ibid. In addition, &quot;[b]y choosing to 'go out for the team,'
[students] voluntarily subject themselves to a degree of regulation even
higher than that imposed on students generally.&quot; Ibid. Here too, the
students covered by the school district's policy, who participate in non-athletic
interscholastic competitions, occupy a comparable position to the student
athletes in Vernonia.</P>

<P>As both courts recognized below, &quot;like athletes, participants in
other extracurricular activities have a somewhat lesser privacy expectation
than other students.&quot; Pet. App. 21a; see id. at 65a-66a (district court).
For example, students who sign-up for competitive activities covered by
the school district's policy must comply with rules and regulations not
applicable to other students. The OSSAA subjects them to added academic
requirements concerning such matters as class attendance and credits and,
in particular, obligates them to act in a manner that does not discredit
their schools. C.A. App. 80-81, 104-105. Various extracurricular squads
also subject members to their own sets of rules. Pet. App. 66a. Further,
as is true with respect to team sports, the activities of non-athletic extracurricular
groups are monitored by faculty sponsors, imposing an added degree of supervision
not experienced by other students. Ibid.</P>

<P>In addition, Tecumseh High students who participate in non-athletic interscholastic
activities take overnight trips for competitions or related events. J.A.
44-45. The accommodations during such overnight trips often require students
of the same sex to undress and share restroom and bathing facilities. See
J.A. 109-113. To be sure, non-athletic activities typically do not entail
the degree of &quot;communal undress&quot; (Vernonia, 515 U.S. at 657) to
which students must submit as part of some team sports, but they nonetheless
often require students to compromise their privacy interests in a comparable
fashion and to a degree that students who do not participate in such activities
may avoid.</P>

<P>Moreover, just like the student athletes in Vernonia, Tecumseh students
who participate in non-athletic activities covered by the policy voluntarily
assume those added requirements and intrusions when they sign-up or try-out
for the activity. And, of course, they may avoid those requirements-including
drug testing-by choosing not to participate. See Vernonia, 515 U.S. at 666
(Ginsburg, J., concurring) (citing United States v. Edwards, 498 F.2d 496,
500 (2d Cir. 1974) (Friendly, J.)). As the school district's policy underscores,
&quot;[p]articipation in school-sponsored extra-curricular activities at
the Tecumseh Public School District is a privilege.&quot; J.A. 193. Students
who choose to avail themselves of that privilege &quot;have reason to expect
intrusions upon normal rights and privileges, including privacy.&quot; Vernonia,
515 U.S. at 657. That expectation alone seriously undercuts their Fourth
Amendment claim demanding to be excused from the school district's random
drug-testing policy.</P>

<P>B. The &quot;Intrusion Complained Of&quot; In This Case Is, If Anything,
Less Significant Than In Vernonia</P>

<P>The next consideration is &quot;the character of the intrusion that is
complained of.&quot; Vernonia, 515 U.S. at 658. &quot;[T]he degree of intrusion
[caused by urinalysis testing] depends upon the manner in which production
of the urine sample is monitored.&quot; Ibid. In Vernonia, the Court observed
that the intrusion was &quot;negligible,&quot; where urine samples were
collected under conditions &quot;nearly identical to those typically encountered
in public restrooms.&quot; Ibid. Boys provided specimens at a urinal along
a wall while clothed, and were observed by a male monitor only from behind;
girls provided specimens from a closed stall with a female monitor standing
outside. Ibid. Under the policy in this case, all specimens- from both boys
and girls-&quot;must be collected in a restroom or other private facility
behind a closed stall,&quot; while a monitor of the same sex is standing
outside. J.A. 198. Therefore, the policy here actually involves a lesser
degree of intrusion than the one in Vernonia.</P>

<P>In Vernonia, the Court also weighed the degree of intrusion in terms
of the information disclosed by the tests, and found that it was &quot;not
significant.&quot; 515 U.S. at 660. In reaching that conclusion, the Court
emphasized that the tests &quot;look[ed] only for drugs, and not for whether
the student is, for example, epileptic, pregnant, or diabetic&quot;; that
&quot;the drugs for which the samples are screened are standard, and do
not vary according to the identity of the student&quot;; that &quot;the
results of the tests are disclosed only to a limited class of school personnel
who have a need to know&quot;; and that the results &quot;are not turned
over to law enforcement authorities or used for any internal disciplinary
function.&quot; Id. at 658. As the court of appeals recognized, the drug-testing
policy in this case is &quot;virtually identical&quot; to the policy in
Vernonia in terms of &quot;the information obtained, and the use to which
that information is put.&quot; Pet. App. 22a.</P>

<P>Indeed, in this respect as well, the degree of intrusion in this case
is less significant than in Vernonia. In Vernonia, the only concern that
the Court noted was that the policy could be construed to require students
&quot;to identify in advance [of any positive result] prescription medications
they are taking.&quot; 515 U.S. at 659. The Court observed, however, that
such concern would be ameliorated if students were permitted to provide
such information &quot;in a confidential manner-for example, in a sealed
envelope delivered to the testing lab.&quot; Id. at 660. Unlike the policy
in Vernonia, the policy here explicitly calls for such confidential treatment.
See J.A. 199 (&quot;The medication list shall be submitted to the lab in
a sealed and confidential envelope and shall not be viewed by district employees.&quot;).</P>

<P>C. The Court Of Appeals Erred In Concluding That The Government Concern
In This Case Is Of A Different Constitutional Dimension Than The One In
Vernonia</P>

<P>The remaining consideration is &quot;the nature and immediacy of the
governmental concern at issue here, and the efficacy of [the challenged]
means for meeting it.&quot; Vernonia, 515 U.S. at 660. Even though the &quot;governmental
concern&quot; at issue and &quot;means for meeting it&quot; are essentially
the same here as in Vernonia, the court of appeals concluded that &quot;[t]his
factor tips the balancing analysis decidedly in favor of [respondents].&quot;
Pet. App. 22a. In reaching that conclusion, the court emphasized that the
policy here applies to non-athletic activities, and that the record of drug
use here does not rise to the level of that in Vernonia. Neither of those
distinctions is of constitutional dimension.</P>

<P>1. The Policy's Application To Non-Athletes Does Not Render The Government
Concern Any Less Significant. Here, as in Vernonia, &quot;[t]hat the nature
of the concern is important-indeed, perhaps compelling-can hardly be doubted.&quot;
515 U.S. at 661. &quot;Deterring drug use by our Nation's schoolchildren
is at least as important as enhancing efficient enforcement of the Nation's
laws against the importation of drugs, which was the governmental concern
in Von Raab, or deterring drug use by engineers and trainmen, which was
the governmental concern in Skinner.&quot; Ibid. (citations omitted); see
20 U.S.C. 7102(2) (&quot;The widespread illegal use of alcohol and other
drugs among the Nation's secondary [and elementary] school students * *
* constitutes a grave threat to such students' physical and mental well-being,
and significantly impedes the learning process.&quot;). The compelling nature
of the government interest in deterring drug use in schools is alone sufficient
to justify a drug-testing policy like the one at issue here.</P>

<P>Although it did not question the government's interest &quot;in deterring
drug use among students,&quot; the court of appeals suggested that that
concern was less forceful here than in Vernonia on the ground that the risk
of injury posed by drug use to student athletes is greater than to students
engaged in the non-athletic activities covered by the policy in this case.
Pet. App. 22a. To be sure, the linebacker faces a greater risk of serious
injury if he takes the field under the influence of drugs than the drummer
in the halftime band. But at the same time, the risk of injury to a student
who is under the influence of drugs while playing golf, cross country, or
volleyball (sports covered by the policy in Vernonia) is scarcely any greater
than the risk of injury to a student who is drug-impaired while building
a 15-foot-high human pyramid (as cheerleaders do), handling a 1500-pound
steer (as FFA members do), or working with cutlery or sharp instruments
(as FHA members do). See J.A. 21, 51, 75-76, 79-81. Moreover, students who
participate in extracurricular activities, athletic or not, risk harm from
drug use not just when they are competing, but at any time during the trips
or overnight stays that they often take in connection with events. See pp.
14-15, supra.6</P>

<P>Apart from the risk of injury to students who compete in OSSAA-governed
events under the influence of drugs, the school district has another weighty
interest in ensuring that students who participate in such events do so
drug-free: when students step onto the auditorium stage for an academic
&quot;Quiz Bowl,&quot; the fairground for an FFA event, or the basketball
court for Pom Pom, they do so on behalf of Tecumseh High. As the policy
itself states, &quot;[s]tudents who participate in [covered] activities
are respected by the student body and are representing the school district
and the community.&quot; J.A. 193. Whatever the risk of injury from competing
under the influence of drugs, the school district has a strong interest
in seeing that those who represent Tecumseh High are not an &quot;embarrassment&quot;
to the school and community, not to mention themselves. J.A. 78.</P>

<P>In a similar vein, in Vernonia, this Court recognized that the &quot;'role
model' effect&quot; of student athletes bolstered the government's interest
in testing student athletes. 515 U.S. at 663. So too here. Cheerleaders,
for example, are just as likely to be role models as football players. And,
as the record reflects, students who engage in non-athletic interscholastic
competitions at Tecumseh High are held in &quot;high esteem&quot; by their
fellow students. C.A. App. 995. Indeed, the success of a non-athletic team-such
as Tecumseh's academic team, which was state champion in 1997 and 1998,
ibid.-may actually call more attention to the members of that team than
to members of sports teams with less success. The school district has an
heightened interest in ensuring that those students do not use drugs.</P>

<P>At the same time, student athletes are no more entitled to protection
from drugs, nor less entitled to legitimate concerns of privacy, than students
who participate in non-athletic activities covered by the policy. Drawing
a distinction between such students demeans both the volleyball player and
the cheerleader by suggesting that one has a greater claim to privacy or
is more deserving of protection from dangerous drugs than the other. There
is, in short, no basis for adopting a constitutional dividing line based
on whether a student chooses to participate in an interscholastic activity
that is athletic, or one that is non-athletic.</P>

<P>2. The School District Was Not Required To Allow Drug Use At Tecumseh
To Worsen Before Adopting Its Policy. Although the court of appeals recognized
that &quot;there was clearly some drug use at the Tecumseh schools,&quot;
Pet. App. 19a, it doubted the &quot;immediacy&quot; of the school district's
concern in addressing that problem because &quot;the evidence of drug use
among those subject to [its policy] is far from the 'epidemic' and 'immediate
crisis' faced by the Vernonia schools.&quot; Id. at 14a; see id. at 24a.
The court further held that &quot;any district seeking to impose a random
suspicionless drug testing policy as a condition to participation in a school
activity must demonstrate that there is some identifiable drug abuse problem
among a sufficient number of those subject to the testing, such that testing
that group will actually redress its drug problem.&quot; Id. at 25a. That
analysis is flawed on several different levels and, if embraced by the Court,
would seriously undercut local efforts to address the pervasive national
problem posed by drugs.</P>

<P>a. First, as this Court's drug-testing cases confirm, the record in Vernonia
by no means establishes the constitutional floor for justifying a random
drug-testing program. Indeed, as the Court explained in Vernonia, the record
in that case suggested an &quot;immediate crisis of greater proportions
than existed in Skinner, where [the Court] upheld the Government's drug-testing
program based on findings of drug use by railroad employees nationwide,
without proof that a problem existed on the particular railroads whose employees
were subject to the test. And of much greater proportions than existed in
Von Raab, where there was no documented history of drug use by any customs
officials.&quot; 515 U.S. at 663 (citations omitted and emphasis added);
see Skinner, 489 U.S. at 607; Van Raab, 489 U.S. at 673. Thus, far from
raising the bar, Vernonia reaffirms that the government may establish a
sufficiently important-and immediate-interest in adopting a random drug-testing
program short of demonstrating that a societal drug problem has infiltrated
a particular group of individuals.</P>

<P>Von Raab underscores the point. In that case, this Court specifically
rejected the notion that, to justify its drug-testing program, the Customs
Service was required to show drug use among the specific employees to be
tested. Instead, the Court recognized that the government has a compelling
interest in preventing drug use among the individuals to be tested; that
there was no doubt that drug use was &quot;one of the most serious problems
confronting our society today&quot;; and that there was &quot;little reason
to believe that American workplaces are immune from this pervasive social
problem.&quot; 489 U.S. at 674. In those circumstances, the Court stated,
&quot;[i]t is sufficient that the Government have a compelling interest
in preventing an otherwise pervasive societal problem from spreading to
the particular context.&quot; Id. at 675 n.3. Without more, the government's
undeniably compelling interest in deterring drug use among school children
similarly justifies the school district's effort in this case to prevent
drugs from spreading (further) to the students subject to its policy.</P>

<P>Chandler v. Miller is not to the contrary. There, the Court-pointing
to Vernonia-observed that &quot;[a] demonstrated problem of drug abuse&quot;
may &quot;bolster[]&quot; the government's arguments that a drug testing
program is &quot;warranted and appropriate,&quot; but-citing to Von Raab-also
recognized that such evidence is &quot;not in all cases necessary to the
validity of a testing regime.&quot; 520 U.S. at 319 (emphasis added). In
Chandler, this Court invalidated a Georgia law requiring candidates for
state office to certify that they had tested negative for illegal drugs.
Quite unlike this case or Vernonia, however, in Chandler there not only
was &quot;no evidence&quot; of any drug problem among individuals subject
to testing, but the State affirmatively disavowed that such a problem existed.
Id. at 319, 321. Rather, the State defended the program largely based on
its &quot;symbolic&quot; need, and not its &quot;'special [need]', as that
term draws meaning from [the Court's] case law.&quot; Id. at 322.</P>

<P>This case illustrates the problem with the court of appeals' approach.
As discussed (at 2), illegal drug use remains pervasive among America's
school children. Even if drug use were not yet a crisis in Oklahoma, the
government would certainly have a compelling interest in preventing that
crisis from occurring. But Oklahoma is not immune from the problem. It has
one of the ten highest rates in the country of reported marijuana use among
students ages 12 through 17. See Office of Applied Studies, Substance Abuse
&amp; Mental Health Services Admin., 1999 Nat'l Household Survey on Drug
Abuse Report App. A, Figure A.5. The record in this case further establishes
that illicit drugs have reached Tecumseh school children, including those
covered by the challenged policy. See pp. 3-4, supra. Against that backdrop,
the school district was not required under this Court's precedents to wait
until drug use became an epidemic before acting to save its children.</P>

<P>b. Second, the evidence of drug use at Tecumseh High in fact paints a
much more disturbing picture than the one portrayed by the court of appeals,
including with respect to students covered by the policy. The court of appeals
characterized the record of &quot;actual drug use&quot; in this case as
&quot;minimal,&quot; Pet. App. 14a, and respondents similarly claim an &quot;almost
complete absence of any drug problem at all in Tecumseh,&quot; Br. in Opp.
15. That view cannot be reconciled with the record evidence, discussed above,
that the school district adopted its policy in response to increasing calls
for action by parents and concerned community members, and following reports
by teachers, students, and parents of suspected or actual drug use among
Tecumseh students (including those covered by the policy), and the discovery
of drugs on school property. See pp. 3-4, supra.7</P>

<P>At the same time that it underestimated the drug problem at Tecumseh
High, the court of appeals arguably exaggerated the record of drug use in
Vernonia. See Pet. App. 32a (Ebel, J., dissenting) (The actual &quot;evidence
in Vernonia of drug use by student athletes, or even by other students attending
either the school in question or other schools in the respondent school
district, was quite limited.&quot;); see id. at 32a-34a, 41a. In other words,
even accepting the court of appeals' characterization of the record in this
case, the evidence of drug use in this case is not materially different
from that in Vernonia. Moreover, in evaluating that evidence, it is important
to recognize that, as this Court reiterated in Vernonia, a person impaired
by drug use &quot;will seldom display any outward 'signs detectable by the
lay person or, in many cases, even the physician.'&quot; 515 U.S. at 664
(quoting Skinner, 489 U.S. at 628 (citation omitted)); see also Von Raab,
489 U.S. at 674. Indeed, drug users go to considerable lengths to conceal
their activities. In all likelihood, therefore, the prevalence of drug use
at Tecumseh High is actually greater than what the record discloses.</P>

<P>c. Third, the court of appeals failed to accord appropriate deference
to the judgments of local school officials as to the severity of the problem
and need for action. The local board of education-in which parents of school
children typically are represented-occupies a far better vantage point to
gauge the threat posed by illegal drugs to their own schools and children
than federal appellate judges. See Vernonia, 515 U.S. at 665; Board of Educ.,
Island Trees Union Free Sch. Dist. No. 26 v. Pico, 457 U.S. 853, 863 (1982)
(plurality opinion) (&quot;The Court has long recognized that local school
boards have broad discretion in the management of school affairs.&quot;).
The school district in this case adopted its drug-testing policy only after
it had tried other anti-drug measures and had held community meetings to
receive input on its proposed policy. The court of appeals erred in substituting
its judgment for that of the school district as to the immediacy of the
drug threat faced by Tecumseh students.</P>

<P>d. Fourth, as Judge Ebel explained, the court of appeals failed to take
into account the unique dangers posed by illegal drugs and, in particular,
the added difficulties in addressing a drug problem after drugs have become
deeply entrenched in a community or its schools. See Pet. App. 38a-39a (&quot;Illegal
drugs exact a tremendous toll on their victims, and are nearly impossible
to eliminate once they have garnered a foothold in our communities, schools,
and homes.&quot;). In that regard, given the pervasive nature of the drug
problem in schools nationwide and the incalculable damage inflicted on students
and communities by illegal drugs, school administrators should have the
same leeway to adopt the type of drug-testing policy at issue in this case
to maintain a drug-free school as they do to adopt such a policy in an overdue
effort to recreate one. Preventing drugs from &quot;spreading&quot; to a
school is just as important as saving a drug-infested school, and much easier
to do. Indeed, in Vernonia, this Court discussed the need to deter drug
use, not just detect it. Schools across the Nation have a uniform interest
in employing drug testing to deter drug use without regard to how much drug
use is, in fact, detected. In short, schools have an interest in preventing
irreparable damage before it occurs.</P>

<P>D. Under A Proper Balancing, The School District's Drug- Testing Policy
Is Reasonable And Thus Constitutional</P>

<P>Balancing the foregoing factors leads to the same result here as in Vernonia:
the school district's policy &quot;is reasonable and hence constitutional.&quot;
515 U.S. at 665. Indeed, as discussed, the &quot;most significant element&quot;
(ibid.) in Vernonia-the government's guardianship responsibilities to children
in the public school context-is present in equal measure here, and the &quot;the
intrusion complained of&quot; here is, if anything, less significant than
in Vernonia. The only consideration that could alter the mix is the nature
and immediacy of the government concern at issue. Whatever the differences
between the record of drug use in this case and in Vernonia, the school
district was more than justified in deciding that it was time to adopt an
added deterrent in the form of random drug testing of covered students.</P>

<P>A contrary conclusion would plunge the administrators of the Nation's
public schools into a Fourth Amendment regime in which virtually any random
drug-testing policy could be subjected to costly, fact-intensive litigation
in which the constitutionality of one policy versus another would turn on
finely drawn distinctions between, for example, how many marijuana cigarettes
were discovered at one school as opposed to another; how many members of
the football team had been caught for or suspected of drug use as opposed
to members of the cheerleading squad; or whether it was more dangerous for
a student to wrestle another student under the influence of drugs or to
handle a steer. Neither students nor schools would benefit from such a microscopic
approach to the &quot;special needs&quot; analysis of Vernonia.</P>

<P>There is no need to require such case-specific, and ultimately standardless,
inquiries into efforts to address a national problem like drug use in our
schools. The government has a compelling interest in preventing the spread
of this &quot;pervasive societal problem&quot; (Von Raab, 489 U.S. at 675
n.3), and schools across the country have an equally compelling interest
in ensuring that they do not become engulfed by that problem. Efforts to
draw fine distinctions about the incidence of drug use in one school versus
another will only frustrate implementation of needed solutions. The Court
should leave schools flexibility to adopt reasonable measures, like the
policy in this case, to prevent illicit drugs from gaining a stronger hold
on their communities, and protect school children from the life-altering
perils of drug use.</P>

<P>DECEMBER 2001</P>

<P>1 In fiscal years 1996 through 2001, Congress appropriated between $340
and $415 million annually for local drug and violence prevention efforts.
Under the Act, the school district in this case received annual grants for
such efforts in the past four years totaling approximately $40,000.</P>

<P>2 In the 1999 survey, 7.2% of students said that they had used marijuana
on school property in the previous month. More than 30% of students reported
that they had been offered or sold illegal drugs on school property in the
prior year. Youth Risk Behavior at 18.</P>

<P>3 The policy has been implemented in three years. During the 2000-2001
school year, for example, 642 initial tests were given. Eleven students
tested positive, four of whom were involved in non-athletic activities.
During that same year, 205 random tests were conducted and six students
tested positive, one of whom was involved in a non-athletic activity. C.A.
Pet. Reh'g 5 n.3.</P>

<P>4 Respondents do not challenge the policy as applied to students involved
in interscholastic athletics.</P>

<P>5 The Court has conducted the same balancing analysis in considering
suspicionless drug-testing policies adopted by federal employers, see Von
Raab, supra (upholding United States Customs Service's policy of urinalysis
drug testing for employees transferred to drug-interdiction or firearm-carrying
positions); Skinner, supra (upholding Federal Railroad Administration's
policy of urinalysis drug and alcohol testing for rail employees involved
in train accidents or who violate safety rules), and by the States, see
Chandler v. Miller, 520 U.S. 305, 316 (1997) (holding unconstitutional state
law requiring candidates for state public office to certify that they have
passed a urinalysis drug test).</P>

<P>6 The court of appeals acknowledged that some of the extracurricular
activities in this case &quot;involve a safety issue comparable to that
of athletics,&quot; but argued that the school district's policy nonetheless
was overinclusive in that it also covered extracurricular activities (e.g.,
academic team) that did not pose such a safety risk and was underinclusive
in that it did not apply to regular school activities (e.g., shop class)
that might pose such a risk. Pet. App. 23a. But that also was true of the
policy in Vernonia, which applied not only to wrestlers but to golfers,
and which did not extend to shop class. In seeking to deter drug use among
their students, school administrators need not act with the sort of precision
demanded by a &quot;narrow tailoring&quot; analysis. Rather, the touchstone
under the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness. And, as discussed, the school
district here, like the one in Vernonia, had ample reason-including safety
concerns-for targeting students who choose to participate in extracurricular
competitions for random drug testing.</P>

<P>7 Respondents have pointed to certain statements in applications filed
by the school district for funding under the Safe and Drug-Free Schools
and Communities Act. See J.A. 163-192. For example, those forms state that
illegal &quot;drugs * * * are present [at Tecumseh]&quot; but, compared
to alcohol and tobacco, &quot;have not identified themselves as major problems
at this time.&quot; J.A. 191; see J.A. 180, 186. As the district court explained,
those statements must be read in context and, more to the point, comprise
only a part of the evidentiary record developed in this litigation. See
Pet. App. 60a n.23.
