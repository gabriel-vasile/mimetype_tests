<P><B>Vernonia now has more potential as an industrial oilseed crop because
ARS researchers have discovered how to breed varieties that will hold on to more
of the seed until harvest.</B> Vernonia oil might be used in environmentally
friendly drying agents in paints.  The industry wants alternatives to today's
volatile organic compounds that are irritants and airborne contaminants. 
Unfortunately, vernonia's commercial development has been crippled because
available varieties shed too many seeds. Last fall, ARS scientists discovered
that some vernonia plants possess a petal-like device that holds the seeds
upright. These plants retained more seeds. Scientists will cross-breed these
plants this summer. This will reinforce the seed-holding trait and is the next
step to higher yielding commercial varieties. The content of epoxy oils in
vernonia, up to 40 percent, is double that of most other oilseeds like soybean
and linseed. Vernonia oil also might be used in manufacturing more flexible
plastics and in other resins like varnish.<BR><A

<P><B>A procedure known as high-volume instrumentation is the cotton
industry's standard tool for determining the length, strength and natural color
of cotton.</B> Adding another process--called near- infrared spectroscopy
(NIR)--could also reveal bulk maturity, a characteristic that's key to how well
the cotton will take dye. Dye imperfections cost the U.S. cotton industry
approximately $200 million annually.  NIR uses light wavelengths that the human
eye can't see to detect otherwise invisible fiber qualities.  NIR failed to win
industry acceptance in the past because of shortcomings in speed and accuracy. 
Now researchers have improved the mechanical design.  One improvement: The new
system uses a larger cotton sample pressed against a bigger glass plate, where
the light waves shoot through the fiber. The bigger sample helps reduce
measurement errors.  Also, the mathematical equations used to analyze the NIR
readings have been fine-tuned.  In tests, the improved NIR analysis showed less
than 2 percent error in its ability to predict cotton maturity.<BR><A
