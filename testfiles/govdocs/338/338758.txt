.1 think there can be no doubt, that this is a new and distinct species of Vernonia, although the description from a single specimen may be imperfect.
Stem apparently about one foot high, erect, grooved, somewhat scabrous, and densely covered by proportionally large, suberect leaves. These are sessile, subclasping, lanceolate, acuminate, about one inch and a half long, entire towards the point, sharply serrate below, and about half an inch broad. Upper surface roughly scabrous, the lower remarkably punctate by numerous small, impressed pores, otherwise smooth. Corymb terminal, fastigiate, pedicells pulverulently subvillous. Calyx ovate, imbricate. Scales ovate, obtuse, very large, and finely ciliate all round their margin.
Flowers red, of considerable size.
84.  Artemisia sericea, Nutt. Gen. II. p. 14?. Peculiar to the north-west; labelled by Mr. Nuttall, Hob. Prairies of St. Peter's and Red rivers.
85.  Gnaphalium margaritaceum, Pursh, p. 524. Common in Pennsylvania.
Hab. Rainy Lake.
86.  Erigeron canadense, /3. *grandiflorum.
This may be a new species; as, however, the leaves and stem resemble the canadense perfectly, and there is but one specimen, I prefer arranging it as a variety. The flowers are more than twice the size of those of E. canadense, (with some appearance that the rays were yellow, on short peduncles and pedicells, by no means branching out, crowded together in the summit and axills of the leaves.

I am not perfectly satisfied that this is the species de-
