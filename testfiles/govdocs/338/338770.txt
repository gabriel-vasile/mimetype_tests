PRESS STATEMENT OF COMMISSIONER GLORIA TRISTANI

Re:  Enforcement Bureau Letter Ruling on WGR (AM) Buffalo, New York
Indecency Complaint

	The FCC Enforcement Bureau has issued a letter dismissing an indecency complaint filed 
by Michael Palko of Buffalo, New York.  Mr. Palko's complaint against WGR (AM) arose from 
words uttered during the "Bauerle and the Bull Dog" show.  Mr. Palko alleged the station 
undertook a

[M]onth long piece where the station has purchased urinal splash guards 
with National Hockey League emblems on them to distribute to local bars 
and restaurants. Throughout this campaign, the co-hosts would regularly 
talk about who they would like to "piss on" and callers were invited to call 
in to talk about who in the NHL they would "piss on."  The co-hosts 
regularly discuss "pissing" on NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman. 

Mr. Palko also noted the show is a "morning sports talk" show and he believed the "on-going 
bit" relied on "gratuitous use of excretory references."   Mr. Palko also complained of Mr. 
Bauerle's use of the phrase "sawed off little prick" and repeated use of the word "prick."  He 
reported his belief that Mr. Bauerle had been "reprimanded" previously for using the same 
phrase.

The Division Chief dismissed the complaint: "Because the discussion you describe does 
not describe sexual or excretory activities or organs in a patently offensive manner, I am 
dismissing your complaint."  The Bureau also noted the challenged remarks were "brief" and 
"subject matter alone is not sufficient."   Based on the record before us, I cannot agree.  Mr. 
Palko stated a prima facie case for indecency sufficient to survive dismissal.  As I discuss below, 
this is one of the rare complaints where each portion of the complaint comports with recognized 
examples of indecent broadcast material.



A. Applicable Law

I start, as always, with the statute the FCC enforces: 

Whoever utters any obscene, indecent, or profane language by 
means of radio communication shall be fined not more than 
$10,000 or imprisoned not more than two years, or both.  

Our definition of an indecent broadcast is:

[l]anguage or material that, in context, depicts or describes, in 
terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community 
standards for the broadcast medium, sexual or excretory activities 
or organs.  

Among the factors that the Commission examines to determine whether material is patently 
offensive include the actual words or depictions in context to see if they are, for example, 
"vulgar" or "shocking," and whether the material is dwelled upon or reference to it is isolated 
and fleeting.  

The Supreme Court has pointed out that what constitutes a "patently offensive" 
broadcast:

[D]epends on context (the kind of program on which it appears), 
degree (not "an occasional expletive"), and time of broadcast (a 
"pig" is offensive in "the parlor" but not the "barnyard"). 

The context question focuses first on the type of medium, here it is broadcasting , and second on 
the "type" of program, here a "morning sports talk" show.  The "degree" of offensiveness 
requires the remarks be distinguished from an "occasional" expletive and the time of day is 
referenced primarily to draw attention to the fact that children may be listening.   In Pacifica the 
Court also said:

In this case, it is undisputed that the content of Pacifica's broadcast 
was "vulgar," "offensive," and "shocking."

The "content" at issue in Pacifica was a seven word list that was part of a lengthier monologue 
repeatedly employing the seven words.  One of the words in the seven word list at issue in 
Pacifica was "piss,"   the repeated use of which is at issue here.  In Pacifica the parties did not 
dispute the FCC's finding that the monologue was indecent.

In a separate setting, the Court has said the discharge of urine is "an excretory function 
traditionally shielded by great privacy."   In U.S. v. Harvey, 991 F.2d 981 (2nd Cir. 1993), a 
defendant's criminal conviction for possession of child pornography was overturned because, 
inter alia, the prosecution introduced testimony regarding the content of some adult videos, 
seized from defendant, that did not involve children.  The testimony included depictions of video 
content "of people engaging in gross acts involving human waste," and describing "people 
urinating on each other."   The Second Circuit reversed the conviction because the testimony 
was introduced to create, "disgust and antagonism toward [the defendant], and resulted in 
overwhelming prejudice against him." 

In 1997, Senator Joseph Lieberman described a disturbingly similar scene in a video 
game brought to his attention by a concerned parent:

What makes Primal Rage novel, however, is a scene known among 
teenage players as the "Golden Showers" in which an ape-like 
creature celebrates the killing of his opponent by actually urinating 
on the corpse. 

Senator Lieberman described the scene as both "repulsive" and "degrading."  See also U.S. v. 
Prytz, 822 F.Supp. 311 (D.S.C. 1993) (criminal defendant purchased video tapes the Court 
described as "depicting sexual activity involving urination," and the defendant described as 
"golden shower" tapes).

The foregoing should leave no doubt in anyone's mind that Mr. Palko's allegations 
should not be dismissed.  The U.S. Supreme Court has noted urination is excretory and is not a 
subject for routine public viewing.  The repeated broadcast of the word "piss" has been 
unquestioningly accepted as meeting the contour of a "vulgar" and "shocking" broadcast by the 
Court.  Urination on others is so offensive to the community's sense of decency and so 
inflammatory that a conviction for possession of child pornography was thrown out because 
such imagery was among the degrading subjects discussed before a jury.  If the Constitution may 
bar discussion of such inflammatory imagery in a criminal trial, why should it be approved for 
broadcast when children are listening?  Proposing to routinely urinate on someone to express 
disagreement with that person's sports affiliations (the NHL teams) or job performance (the 
NHL Commissioner) is the kind of degrading and pointless personal attack that possesses little 
political value.  Like "fighting words,"

[S]uch utterances are no essential part of any exposition of ideas, 
and are of such slight social value as a step to truth that any benefit 
that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by the social 
interest in order and morality.  

Taken together these points should have counseled hesitation by the Bureau sufficient to at least 
issue a letter of inquiry to this station.

B.	Dismissal is Improper on the Facts of this Case

The facts alleged by Mr. Palko demonstrate the "type" of program was a regularly 
scheduled morning radio program obviously targeting listeners traveling to their morning 
destinations and was not an adult only program.  It contained a vulgar and apparently repeated 
reference to urinating on other people and at least one target of this behavior was identified by 
name.  Urination on other people appears to have been a promoted theme of the program rather 
than anything that could be considered isolated or fleeting.  The broadcast was made during the 
normal hours children are riding in cars on their way to school and are thus likely listeners.

The Bureau concluded no further investigation was needed.  However, the review of the 
thankfully thin caselaw on how to treat speech, whether video or radio, that involves urinating on 
others demonstrates that once again our Bureau read the facts alleged in the complaint in the 
light most favorable to the broadcaster rather than the complainant.  This conflicts with well-
settled principles of civil law where dismissal of civil complaints is permissible only if "it is 
clear that no relief could be granted under any set of facts that could be proved consistent with 
the allegations."   Moreover, it is difficult to discern what more specific allegations are 
necessary to state a prima facie violation of the statute.  It may be that constitutional precepts 
ultimately require such facts be proved prior to imposition of a penalty, but it does not require 
such proof at the outset of a proceeding.

It seems the Bureau ignored the allegation that this was a shameless month-long 
campaign to discredit individuals and teams of individuals by covering them with human waste.  
Callers were also apparently encouraged to use vulgarities like the word "prick."  I am at a loss 
to explain the failure to even seek further review.  This decision adds weight to the public's 
conclusion that the FCC's indecency enforcement program is ineffective.  Our children deserve 
better.
