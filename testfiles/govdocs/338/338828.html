           ABOUT CURTAILING TEEN SMOKING ON THIS FLOOR TODAY, WE'RE
           TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE. BUT IF YOU BELIEVE THAT WE ARE

           CAN WORK WONDERS IN TERMS OF ALLOCATING GOODS AND SERVICES, YOU

           INDICATED, THE EVIDENCE IS REPLETE FROM MANY DIFFERENT SOURCES
           OF THIS EFFECT. REPORTS FROM THE INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE'S

           THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY, THE SURGEON GENERAL, ALL THESE
           INDICATE THE CORRELATION BETWEEN PRICE INCREASES AND REDUCED
           TEENAGE SMOKING. A NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH STUDY
           IN 1996 FOUND THAT YOUNG PEOPLE WERE THREE TIMES AS SENSITIVE
           TO CIGARETTE PRICES AS OLDER SMOKERS. A 1997 STUDY IN TOBACCO
           CONTROL FOUND A STRONG RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CIGARETTE PRICES
           AND YOUTHFUL SMOKING. WITH EACH 10% INCREASE IN PRICE RESULTING

           IN A 9% REDUCTION IN YOUTH SMOKING. AND IN 1998, A REPORT
           TAKING ACTIONS TO REDUCE TOBACCO USE, THE INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE
           OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES CONCLUDED THAT THE
           SINGLE-MOST DIRECT AND RELIABLE METHOD FOR REDUCING CONSUMPTION
           IS TO INCREASE THE PRICE OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS; THUS, ENCOURAGING
           THE CESSATION AND REDUCING THE LEVEL OF INITIATION OF TOBACCO
           USE. A NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE EXPERT PANEL IN 1993 REPORTED
           A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN TOBACCO EXCISE TAXES MAY BE THE
           SINGLE-MOST EFFECTIVE MEASURE FOR DECREASING TOBACCO

           CONSUMPTION, AND THEY ALSO CONCLUDED THAT AN EXCISE TAX REDUCES
           CONSUMPTION BY CHILDREN AND TEENAGERS AT LEAST AS MUCH AS IT
           REDUCES CONSUMPTION BY ADULTS. IN 1994, THE SURGEON GENERAL
           REPORTED LIKEWISE, INDICATES A REAL PRICE INCREASE WOULD
           SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE CIGARETTE SMOKING. ALL OF THIS DATA, ALL
