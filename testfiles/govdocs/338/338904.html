Wetland Classification and Characterization:</strong></a><strong>
</strong></p>

<p>The tidal wetlands along the lower Connecticut River are
exemplary and yet representative examples of the variation in the
types of tidal wetlands found along most of the larger estuaries
in the northeastern United States. Tidal inundation is the<strong>
</strong>common factor shared by salt, brackish, and freshwater
tidal marshes, with dissimilarity in major floristic elements and
physiognomy correlated to variations in salinity and duration of
flooding. The classification established by the National Wetlands
Inventory is used here to provide a general characterization of
the wetlands in the project area. Three systems of wetlands are
present in this area: namely, the <strong><u>Estuarine</u></strong>,
<strong><u>Riverine</u></strong>, and <strong><u>Palustrine</u></strong>.
A general description of the floristic and vegetational variation
that can be observed in these marshes is presented below and is
based upon a synthesis of information contained in Barrett
(1989), Hotchkiss (1947), Metzler and Rozsa (1982, 1986), and
Nichols (1920).</p>

<p><strong><u>Estuarine</u></strong><strong> </strong><strong><u>System</u></strong>:
The Estuarine System embraces those tidal waters with a salinity
greater than 0.5 ppt and less than 30 ppt. Surface water
salinities are the most important determinant of wetland
vegetation, because these are the waters that will actually flood
the marsh surface. Since plants are most actively growing during
the late spring and summer months, the salinity conditions at
that time of year are of the greatest importance to determining
the characteristics of the vegetation. The estuarine system in
the lower Connecticut River extends from the mouth of the river
north to, and including, Great Meadows in Essex, a distance of
approximately 13 kilometers (8 miles). Estuarine marshes in the
lower Connecticut River system include both salt and brackish
tidal marshes, described below.</p>

<p><strong>Salt Marshes</strong>: Salt marshes are those tidal
wetlands with a soil salinity greater than 18 ppt and, thus,
attain their optimal development in the project area in proximity
to the chief source of salt water, Long Island Sound. At the
beginning of the growing season, there is little or no detectable
salt water in the surface waters of the river. By late July and
early August, surface waters with a salinity greater than 18 ppt
penetrate as far north as the railroad bridge in Old Lyme/Old
Saybrook, a distance of approximately 8 kilometers (5 miles).
However, throughout much of Great Island soil salinities are
still below 18 ppt, except for the extreme southern portion.
Here, in a very narrow zone, salt marshes occur.</p>

<p>As is typical of most salt marshes along the shoreline of Long
Island Sound, the dominant vegetation zone is the high marsh,
characterized by black grass (<em>Juncus gerardii</em>),
salt-meadow cord-grass (<em>Spartina patens</em>), and spike
grass (<em>Distichlis spicata</em>). The vegetation here often
forms a mosaic rather than a distinct zone. Other plant
associates include seaside goldenrod (<em>Solidago sempervirens</em>),
perennial salt marsh aster (<em>Aster tenuifolius</em>), salt
marsh aster (<em>Aster subulatus</em>), and spearscale (<em>Atriplex
patula</em> var. <em>hastata</em>). Also found on the high marsh
are pannes, or shallow depressions, containing glasswort (<em>Salicornia
europaea</em>), stunted smooth cordgrass (<em>Spartina
alterniflora</em>), sea lavender (<em>Limonium nashii</em>),
seaside plantain (<em>Plantago oliganthos</em>), sea blite (<em>Sueda
maritima</em>), and arrow-grass (<em>Triglochin maritimum</em>).
The low marsh zone exists as a narrow band along the waterward
edge of the marsh, including creeks and ditches. Smooth cordgrass
typically forms a monoculture here. </p>

<p>Submerged aquatic vegetation beds composed of a sparse cover
of eelgrass (<em>Zostera marina</em>) occur in the shallow
subtidal waters of South Cove and near the lower portion of Great
Island.</p>

<p><strong>Brackish Marshes</strong>: The second type of tidal
wetlands in the estuarine system is that occupying the mesohaline
and oligohaline portions of the river from Great Island to Great
Meadows. There is a gradual but progressive change in physiognomy
(life form or structure) in the vegetation from short brackish
meadows at the downstream end of the mesohaline zone to tall
common reed (<em>Phragmites australis</em>) at the upstream end
of the oligohaline zone.</p>

<p>The primary vegetational community in areas such as Great and
Upper Islands and Ragged Rock Creek is the brackish meadow.
Dominant plants include salt-meadow cordgrass and black grass,
and this vegetation differs little in appearance from that of the
high salt marshes. Certain salt marsh associates are even more
abundant here, however, such as seaside goldenrod and
arrow-grass. Saltwort and sea lavender are less abundant in the
brackish meadow than in the high salt marshes. As the soil
salinity diminishes, the above-named grasses and rushes give way
to other graminoids, especially bentgrass (<em>Agrostis
stolonifera</em> var. <em>palustris</em>) and the spike rushes (<em>Eleocharis
palustris</em> and <em>E. rostellata</em>). Other common
associates include straw sedge (<em>Carex straminea</em>), red
fescue (<em>Festuca rubra</em>), mock bishop-weed (<em>Ptiliminum
capillaceum</em>), New York aster (<em>Aster novi-belgii</em>),
salt marsh fleabane (<em>Pluchea purpurascens</em>), silverweed (<em>Potentilla
anserina</em>), common threesquare (<em>Scirpus pungens</em>) and
Olney threesquare (<em>S. americanus</em>).</p>

<p>Smooth cordgrass is the characteristic plant of the low marsh
zone in brackish marshes. In contrast to this zone in the salt
marsh, a distinctive understory vegetation is present and
composed of one or more of some of the following: dwarf spike
rush (<em>Eleocharis parvula</em>), the diminutive umbellifer
lilaeopsis (<em>Lilaeopsis chinensis</em>), and, less commonly,
mudwort (<em>Limosella subulata</em>) and pygmy-weed (<em>Crassula
aquatica</em>). All of these except for dwarf spike rush are
state-listed species of special concern. </p>

<p>Several species of bulrushes and threesquare sedges form a
very distinctive community type in the brackish marshes. These
are all clonal or colony-forming species, and individual colonies
may cover up to five acres. Common threesquare occurs throughout
the brackish marsh complex and Olney threesquare is found only at
lower salinity sites. The three bulrushes in this community type
are short bayonet grass (<em>Scirpus paludosus</em> var. <em>atlanticus)</em>,
tall saltmarsh bulrush (<em>S. cylindricus</em>) and robust
bulrush (<em>S. robustus</em>); the first two are state-listed
species of special concern (see Appendix D). <em>S. robustus</em>
is chiefly a species of mesohaline waters and is replaced by <em>S.
cylindricus</em> in fresher, oligohaline waters. While <em>S.
robustus</em> usually occurs as monospecific stands, colonies of <em>S.
cylindricus</em> generally contain a number of associates such as
dotted smartweed (<em>Polygonum punctatum</em>), showy
bur-marigold (<em>Bidens laevis</em>), rush (<em>Juncus
acumunatus</em>), water parsnip (<em>Sium suave</em>), and
softstem-bulrush (<em>Scirpus validus</em>).</p>

<p>From Upper Island to Great Meadows, the vegetation is
predominantly brackish reed. The dominant species here is
narrow-leaved cattail (<em>Typha angustifolia</em>) which often
forms extensive monospecific colonies. The average height of this
cattail is 1.6 meters (5 feet). Other reed species that may form
extensive colonies here include robust bulrush, common
threesquare, common reed, and rose mallow (<em>Hibiscus palustris</em>).
In brackish meadows, colonies of reed vegetation may occur
throughout. Likewise, in reed dominated areas, pockets of
brackish meadow vegetation occur throughout. As in the salt and
brackish marshes, the low marsh zone in the reed communities
principally supports smooth cordgrass.</p>

<p>At Great Meadows, there is a unique tall reed vegetational
community dominated by the hybrid cattail (<em>Typha</em> x <em>glauca</em>)
on the high marsh. This cattail can grow to heights of 2.5-3.3
meters (8-10 feet). Common reed and rose mallow are often
codominants, and the former may occur in dense, monospecific
stands. Associates include marsh fern (<em>Thelypteris palustris</em>),
spike rush (<em>Eleocharis smallii</em>), arrow arum (<em>Peltandra
virginica</em>), purple loosestrife (<em>Lythrum salicaria</em>),
bur-marigold (<em>Bidens cernua</em>), mermaid weed (<em>Proserpinaca
palustris</em>), and dotted smartweed. In the drier upland
borders, freshwater cordgrass (<em>Spartina pectinata</em>) and
switch grass (<em>Panicum virgatum</em>) are often dominant
plants. The low marsh zone along North Cove is composed
principally of common threesquare, and associates include salt
marsh hemp (<em>Amaranthus cannabinus</em>), dotted smartweed,
and sweet flag (<em>Acorus calamus</em>). </p>

<p>On muddy intertidal flats, the vegetation is often sparse and
composed of a variety of herbs. These include dwarf spike rush
and several state-listed species of special concern, including
lilaeopsis, tidal arrow-head (<em>Sagittaria spatulata</em>),
mudwort, and Hudson arrowhead (<em>Sagittaria subulata</em>). The
last species is more prevalent on freshwater tidal mudflats.</p>

<p>In the protected subtidal waters and tidal creeks of the
brackish marsh system, a distinctive community of submerged
aquatic vegetation develops. The primary species here are horned
pondweed (<em>Zannichellia palustris</em> var. <em>major</em>),
Sago pondweed (<em>Potamogeton pectinatus</em>), pondweed (<em>Potamogeton
richardsonii</em>), redhead-grass (<em>Potamogeton perfoliatus</em>),
red pondweed (<em>Potamogeton alpinus</em>), tape-grass or wild
celery (<em>Vallisneria americana</em>), widgeon grass (<em>Ruppia
maritima</em>), and water-weed (<em>Elodea nuttallii</em>).</p>

<p><strong><u>Riverine</u></strong><strong> </strong><strong><u>System</u></strong><strong>:</strong>
As defined by the National Wetlands Inventory, the riverine
system includes those freshwater wetlands and deepwaters
contained within the river channel and composed of <em>nonpersistent</em>
vegetation, as contrasted with the palustrine wetlands described
below which contain <em>persistent</em> vegetation. In the
project area, this system lies principally between Great Meadows
and the northern boundary. The dominant plants are nonpersistent
emergent herbaceous plants, and include wild rice (<em>Zizania
aquatica</em>), pickerelweed (<em>Pontederia cordata</em>),
common threesquare, softstem-bulrush, bullhead-lily (<em>Nuphar
variegatum</em>), and arrow-arum intermixed with arrowheads (<em>Sagittaria</em>
spp.), bur-marigolds (<em>Bidens</em> spp.), and other
low-growing species which occur in the low marsh zone. Pure and
mixed stands of wild rice generally characterize the majority of
riverine tidal marshes in the project area (Metzler and Rozsa,
1982), although nearly pure stands of common threesquare and
arrowheads, or both, are common along the exposed shore of the
river. Associates include Hudson arrowhead, common arrowhead (<em>Sagittaria
latifolia</em>), common threesquare, water purslane (<em>Ludwigia
palustris</em>), false pimpernel (<em>Lindernia dubia</em>), and
golden club (<em>Orontium aquaticum</em>), the last of which is a
state-listed species of special concern.</p>

<p><strong><u>Palustrine</u></strong><strong> </strong><strong><u>System</u></strong>:
These are wetlands of freshwater environments, both tidal and
nontidal, which support <em>persistent</em> vegetation and occur
primarily above the mean high tide mark. Several vegetation types
of <strong>palustrine tidal emergent wetlands</strong> are
present in the project area, and are especially well-developed
and rich in species diversity. The first is the Acorus
community-type of the mid-tidal marsh with sweet flag, three-way
sedge (<em>Dulichium arundinacium</em>), and reed canary-grass (<em>Phalaris
arundinaceum</em>). Associates include tussock sedge (<em>Carex
stricta</em>), water horsetail (<em>Equisetum fluviatile</em>),
yellow iris (<em>Iris pseudacorus</em>), purple loosestrife,
spotted jewelweed (<em>Impatiens capensis</em>), common
bur-marigold (<em>Bidens frondosa</em>), water smartweed (<em>Polyganum
amphibium</em>), bur-reed (<em>Sparganium eurycarpum</em>), swamp
dock (<em>Rumex verticillata</em>), and rice cutgrass (<em>Leersia
oryzoides</em>).</p>

<p>In the Peltandra community-type, in addition to arrow-arum, a
number of species may dominate including common cattail (<em>Typha
latifolia</em>), river bulrush (<em>Scirpus fluviatilis</em>),
and common reed. This type occurs on regularly flooded marshes,
and community associates include sedges, rice cutgrass, common
bur-marigold, and blue flag (<em>Iris versicolor</em>).</p>

<p>The Onoclea community-type of the high marsh is the most
floristically diverse of the freshwater wetland community types.
Characteristic and often dominant plants include sensitive fern (<em>Onoclea
sensibilis</em>), common cattail, and river bulrush. Associates
include marsh fern (<em>Thelypteris palustris</em>), ground-nut (<em>Apios
americana</em>), clearweed (<em>Pilea pumila</em>), cut-leaved
water-horehound (<em>Lycopus americana</em>), arrow-leaved
tearthumb (<em>Polygonum sagittatum</em>), spotted Joe-Pye-weed (<em>Eupatorium
maculatum</em>), marsh bellflower (<em>Campanula aparinoides</em>),
and tall meadow-rue (<em>Thalictrum polygamum</em>).</p>

<p>In the subtidal areas, there are nearly twenty species of
aquatic vascular plants (see Table 2) that occur in the submerged
aquatic vegetation beds in the project area waters. The most
common species are tape-grass, pondweed (<em>Potamogeton</em>
spp.), coontail (<em>Ceratophyllum demersum</em>), and
water-weed. The core site waterbodies containing the greatest
diversity of submerged aquatic vascular plant species are Hamburg
Cove, Selden Cove, and Salmon River. </p>
