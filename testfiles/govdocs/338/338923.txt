  Description:
    Abstract:
      Analysis of 209 pollen assemblages from surface samples in ten
      vegetation types in the Florida Everglades form the basis to identify
      wetland sub-environments from the pollen record.  This calibration
      dataset makes it possible to infer past trends in hydrology and
      disturbance regime based on pollen assemblages preserved in sediment
      cores. Pollen assemblages from sediment cores collected in different
      vegetation types throughout the Everglades provide evidence on wetland
      response to natural fluctuations in climate as well as impacts of
      human alteration of Everglades hydrology.  Sediment cores were located
      primarily in sawgrass marshes, cattail marshes, tree islands, sawgrass
      ridges, sloughs, marl prairies, and mangroves.  The datasets contain
      raw data on pollen abundance as well as pollen concentration (pollen
      grains per gram dry sediment).
    Purpose:
      Everglades restoration planning requires an understanding of the
      impact of natural and human-induced environmental change on wetland
      stability, and this project focuses specifically on three wetland
      types: tree islands, the sawgrass ridge and slough system, and marl
      prairies.

      Tree islands are considered key indicators of the health of the
      Everglades ecosystem because of their sensitivity to both flooding and
      drought conditions.  Tree islands also act as a sink for nutrients in
      the ecosystem and may play an important role in regulating nutrient
      dynamics.  Although management strategies to restore and even create
      tree islands are being formulated, the published data on their age,
      developmental history, geochemistry, and response to hydrologic
      alterations is limited.  To address these issues, this project
      integrates floral and geochemical data with geologic and vegetational
      mapping activities to establish the timing of tree-island formation
      and impacts of both flooding and droughts on tree islands throughout
      the Everglades.

    Pollen data from surface samples collected during the 1960s:

    Column A (the sample ID) refers to the sites listing.  Line 1 lists taxa
    identified in the samples.  For lines 2-13, original raw data on total
    pollen grains were unavailable, so back-calculation from percentages to
    original counts was not possible.  The numbers provided in these lines
    are percent abundances.  For all other samples, the number of grains
    counted for each taxon was determined by back-calculation from
    percentages and total grains counted, as provided by Riegel, 1965.

    Pollen from surface sample collected in 1995 and 1998:

    Column A (sample ID) refers to the sites listing.  Line 1 identifies
    taxa identified in the samples.  Numbers provided for all taxa represent
    raw counts.  Numbers of exotics counted refers to number of Lycopodium
    grains counted during each pollen count.  For each sample, one tablet of
    Lycopodium grains was added before processing.  Each tablet contains 12,
    542 +/- 416 Lycopodium grains.  Sample weight refers to the dry weight
    of sample processed.  Pollen concentration (pollen grains/gram dry
    sediment) was calculated using the formula

    pollen grains/gram dry sediment= [(pollen counted/exotics counted) x
    12542]/sediment weight

        Core Collection and Sampling

        We collected sediment cores using a piston corer with a 10 cm
        diameter core barrel.  The core barrel was pushed through the
        sediments until it contacted the underlying limestone at all sites
        except in Loxahatchee NWR, where peat thicknesses in excess of 2
        meters would require alternative coring strategies.  After core
        collection, we extruded sediment from the core barrel and sampled it
        at 1 cm increments for the upper 20 cm and at 2 cm increments at
        greater depths.  We described sediment lithology as samples were
        extruded. We dried samples in a 50 deg C oven and subsampled
        sediments at the base of each core and at 20 cm increments above the
        base for radiocarbon dating.  Bulk peats were dated using
        conventional radiocarbon datin

        Geochronology

        Age models for the last century of deposition are based on 210Pb
        (lead-210) and, where applicable, first occurrences of pollen of the
        exotic plant Casuarina which was introduced to south Florida in the
        late 19th century (Langeland, 1990).   Lead-210 (210Pb) activity was
        measured by alpha spectroscopy using the method outlined in Flynn
        (1968) in which 210Pb and its progeny, polonium-210 (210Po), are
        assumed to be in secular equilibrium.   Supported 210Pb activity was
        determined by continuing measurements until activity became constant
        with depth. Excess 210Pb activity was calculated by subtracting the
        supported 210Pb activity from the total 210Pb activity. 
        Accumulation rates were calculated by fitting an exponential decay
        curve to the measured data using least squares optimization and
        making the assumptions of a constant initial excess lead-210
        concentration (the CIC [constant initial concentration] model) . In
        pre-20th century sediments, models are derived from linear
        interpolation between radiocarbon data points obtained on bulk
        sediment samples, which were calibrated to calendar years using the
        Pretoria Calibration Procedure (Stuiver et al., 1993; Talma and
        Vogel, 1993; Vogel et al., 1993).  The shorter hydroperiods and
        shallower water depths on tree-island heads result in seasonal
        drying and oxidation of sediments.  We have noted that radiocarbon
        dates from tree-island head sediments appear to be artificially old
        relative to those in the tail and adjacent marsh.  Cores collected
        in the near tail, directly downstream from the head, have
        radiocarbon dates and vegetational trends that are consistent both
        internally and with adjacent wetlands.  Therefore, we used cores
        from the near tail as our representative sites to detect vegetation
        changes on teardrop-shaped tree islands and for comparison with
        patterns documented in the adjacent marsh.

        Analysis of Pollen Assemblages

        Approximately 0.5-1.0 gram of dry sediment was used for
        palynological analysis. Pollen and spores were isolated from these
        samples using standard palynological techniques (Traverse, 1988;
        Willard et al, 2001a,b).  After drying and weighing samples,
        Lycopodium marker tablets with known concentrations of Lycopodium
        spores were added to approximately 0.5 g of sediment for calculation
        of absolute pollen concentrations (Stockmarr, 1971).  The samples
        were first acetolyzed (9 parts acetic anhydride : 1 part sulfuric
        acid) in a hot-water bath (100 deg C) for 10 minutes, then
        neutralized, and treated with 10% KOH in a hot-water bath for 15
        minutes.  Neutralized samples were sieved with 10 µm and 200 µm
        sieves, and the 10-200 µm fraction was stained with Bismarck Brown,
        mixed with warm glycerin jelly, and mounted on microscope slides.
        Raw data for pollen samples are reposited in the North American
        Pollen Database (NAPD) at the World Data Center for Paleoclimatology
        in Boulder, CO (http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/paleo/pollen.html) and at
        the US Geological Survey South Florida Information Access (SOFIA)
        site (http://sofia.usgs.gov).

        Pollen and spore identification (minimally 300 grains per sample)
        was based on reference collections of the United States Geological
        Survey (Reston, VA) and Willard et al. (2004).  Absolute pollen
        concentrations were calculated using the marker-grain method
        described by Benninghoff (1962).  Marker tablets of Lycopodium
        spores were the source of the exotic grains, and the quantity of
        Lycopodium spores in the marker tablets was determined by the
        manufacturer with a Coulter Counter following the procedures of
        Stockmarr (1973). Absolute pollen concentration was calculated using
        the formula (Maher, 1981): Pconc=RM/V,

        Where:  Pconc = pollen per gram dry sediment; R=pollen grains
        counted/marker grains counted; M=marker grains added; V=dry weight
        of sediment

        Our interpretations of past plant communities are based on the
        quantitative method of modern analogs (Overpeck et al., 1985).  We
        calculated squared chord distance (SCD) between down-core pollen
        assemblages and a suite of 197 surface samples collected throughout
        southern Florida in the early 1960s and 1995-2002 (Willard et al.,
        2001b and this research) to define the similarity between each
        fossil and modern pollen assemblage.  Internal comparison among
        surface samples from ten vegetation types indicates that samples
        with SCD values < 0.15 may be considered close analogs (Willard et
        al., 2001b).  If analogs were present for a fossil assemblage, we
        identified the source vegetation for the fossil assemblage as one of
        the twelve types represented in the modern database.  We divided
        cores into pollen zones based on a combination of visual inspection,
        objective zonation using CONISS (Grimm, 1992), and modern analogs.
