QUESTION:
I'm doing a report on the exploration of Mars in the 1900's and what
I think will happen in the next century. What do you think were the most
important advances in Mars exploration in the past century? What
discoveries do you think scientists will make in this century?

ANSWER from Peter Thomas on January 15, 2000:
We started the century with suggestions of vegetational
changes on Mars.  The early spacecraft missions showed the atmosphere
was thin, dust motion caused many of the changes, and Mars had a
varied geologic past.  Then indications of water flow, early in Mars
history were found by orbiting spacecraft.

Future findings may be where the water went (poles?) and about the
early and changing climate of Mars and what controls its global
climate changes.  Past life might be found, but that is still very
unlikely..??
