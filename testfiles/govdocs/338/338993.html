        What Is Poetry? </span><br>
        by <a href="../authorbios/rifenburgh.html">Dan Rifenburgh</a> </p>
      <p><br>
        I. </p>
      <p>We may feel we know what a thing is, but have trouble defining it. That 
        holds as true for poetry as it does for, say, love or electricity. The 
        American poet Emily Dickinson, though shrinking from offering a definition 
        of poetry, once confided in a letter, &quot;If I feel physically as if 
        the top of my head were taken off, I know that is poetry.&quot; A well-known 
        British poet, A.E. Housman, could identify poetry through a similar response. 
        He said that he had to keep a close watch over his thoughts when he was 
        shaving in the morning, for if a line of poetry strayed into his memory, 
        a shiver raced down his spine and his skin would bristle so that his razor 
        ceased to act. What is this thing that can so physically affect some persons? 
      </p>
      <p>One poet called a poem &quot;a thought, caught in the act of dawning.&quot; 
        Another said a poem is a means of bringing the wind in the grasses into 
        the house. Yet another stated, even more enigmatically: &quot;Poetry 
        is a pheasant disappearing in the brush.&quot; It is just like poets, 
        of course, to talk this way: <em>poetically</em>. It often seems they refrain from 
        saying a thing straight if they can give it a little twist. Such tendencies 
        make you want to lay hands on a good dictionary, where the facts are. 
        The trouble with this approach is, most dictionary definitions of poetry 
        are so dry, limiting, vague, or otherwise unsatisfactory, they eventually 
        send you back to beating the bushes for that elusive, beautiful pheasant 
        you once glimpsed. It's certainly not there in the dictionary. Even 
        so, it is possible to describe the general elements of poetry and to at 
        least indicate the power, range, and magic of this ancient, ever-renewing 
        art form.<br>
        <br>
        Like other forms of literature, poetry may seek to tell a story, enact 
        a drama, convey ideas, offer vivid, unique description or express our 
        inward spiritual, emotional, or psychological states. Yet, poetry pays 
        particularly close attention to words themselves: their sounds, textures, 
        patterns, and meanings. It takes special pleasure in focusing on the verbal 
      music inherent in language. </p>
      <p>When we hear a poem, we may recognize certain patterns, such as a regular 
        beat, a rising rhythm, or a series of rhymes. When we see a poem printed 
        on a page, we might notice another kind of pattern that cues us we are 
        not looking at standard prose: those ragged right-hand margins, indicating 
        the lines must stop there and nowhere else. Whether we hear a poem read 
        aloud or read it on a page, it ought to be clear we are experiencing a 
        special <em>patterned arrangement of language</em>, differing from ordinary 
        speech or prose writing. <br>
        <br>
        This formal patterning, considered aside, for a moment, from poetry's 
        higher aims or its subject matter, has long been one of the chief identifying 
        hallmarks of poetry. Roughly speaking, the devices by which poets achieve 
        these patterned arrangements of language are called the elements of verse. 
        The word &quot;verse&quot; comes to us from the Latin <em>versus</em>, 
        a &quot;turning,&quot; and denotes the turning from the end of one line 
        to the beginning of the next line. For the ancient Greeks and Romans, 
        as for us today, the line was the basic unit of poetry, just as the sentence 
        is the basic unit of prose. Greek and Roman lines were regular in their 
        structure and could be classified and analyzed according to their component 
        elements, the poetic feet in each line, which gives the line's meter. 
        Over time, verse has come to mean poetic composition in regular meter, 
        or metrical composition. Here is an example of English poetry written 
        in a regular meter:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p> Like as the waves make toward the pebbled shore,<br>
          So do our minutes hasten to their end;<br>
          Each changing place with that which goes before,<br>
          In sequent toil all forwards do contend.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>To a person acquainted with verse, the predominant meter here will be 
        readily seen as <em>iambic pentameter</em>, the standard meter of English 
        literary poetry. An iamb is a metrical foot consisting of two syllables. 
        The first syllable is unstressed and the second syllable receives a stress, 
        as in &quot;ta-DA.&quot; There are five of these feet in each line, 
        which is why it is called &quot;pentameter.&quot; </p>
      <p>Below are two of these lines divided by stroke marks into their component 
        metrical feet (iambs) and the stressed syllable in each foot is capitalized:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>Each CHANG/ing PLACE/ with THAT/ which GOES/ beFORE<br>
          In SE/quent TOIL/ all FOR/wards DO/ conTEND.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Not every line of the four lines first quoted above is a perfect iambic 
        pentameter line. Good poets change their meters occasionally to provide 
        variety or for other reasons, but since the predominant meter is iambic 
        pentameter, we can say that is the meter of the poem. Having established 
        the meter, we may also note the end words of each line rhyme in an alternating 
        scheme we can denote as &quot;A-B-A-B.&quot; Those end words are &quot;shore,&quot; 
        &quot;end,&quot; &quot;before&quot; and &quot;contend.&quot; So, 
        we have an example here of rhymed iambic pentameter, a charming snippet 
        of metrical verse from the pen of William Shakespeare. <br>
        <br>
        Verse is poetic composition in regular meter, whether rhymed or not. (If 
        unrhymed, it is called blank verse, as in Milton's Paradise Lost 
        or Shakespeare's dramatic verse.) The exception to this is free 
        verse, which abandons metrical regularity altogether. Yet it, too, &quot;turns&quot; 
        on the basic unit of the line and may rightfully be called verse. The 
        long, rolling, repetitive lines of American poet Walt Whitman and the 
        passionate Hebrew psalms found in the Holy Bible are well-known older 
        examples of free verse. Free verse has grown in popularity since the early 
        twentieth century and has now pretty well &quot;swept the field,&quot; 
        as poet Stanley Kunitz observed. The majority of poets today choose to 
        work in free verse, though there are many fine poets still working in 
        meter. </p>
      <p>Having loosely established what verse is, it should now be emphasized 
        that verse is not what we mean by the word &quot;poetry.&quot; Devices 
        such as rhythm, rhyme, alliteration, meter, and regular line length are 
        elements of verse which aid poets in producing patterned arrangements 
        of language called &quot;poems,&quot; yet, supplemental to these, certain 
        qualities of imagination, of emotion, and of language itself must be added 
        before we can properly call a piece of writing by the name of &quot;poetry.&quot; 
        Poetry is considered a higher thing than mere verse, and for good reasons. 
        This is an important point, to which we'll want shortly to return, 
        but let's consider verse and its patternings a little farther.<br>
        <br>
        It is surprising to some people to learn that more than ninety percent 
        of the poems in any standard anthology of English poetry are written in 
        formally structured, highly patterned metrical verse. Similarly high percentages 
        would obtain for anthologies of the poetry of most other languages, including 
        Greek, German, French, Latin, Russian and Spanish. Why?<br>
        <br>
        Formal patterns seem to help preserve and hold the ideas, emotional power, 
        and verbal energy of poetry as a bottle holds wine. Devices such as repetition, 
        alliteration, rhythm, rhyme, and meter also greatly aid the human mind 
        in memorizing poetry. This was vital to poetry's existence before 
        the invention of writing. Homer's vast epics, the <em>Iliad</em> 
        and the <em>Odyssey</em>, were oral compositions committed to and transmitted 
        by human memory before they were eventually written down. Much of early 
        Greek poetry was transmitted by rhapsodes, or human reciters. The same 
        was true of the lengthy historical narratives composed and memorized by 
        the bards of Ireland and Wales, who were the official repositories of 
        their peoples' histories. This same phenomenon appears in cultures 
        all around the globe. <br>
        <br>
        There is a very old saying, &quot;Art is long; life is short.&quot; 
        Poetic art has a better chance of becoming long-lasting art when it takes 
        advantage of the devices of verse which serve to pattern language. One 
        American poet once said that a poem is &quot;a time machine&quot; made 
        out of words, by means of which people in the past may speak to us and 
        we may speak to people in the past, present, and future. It is a famous 
        conceit of poets that they have the ability to &quot;immortalize&quot; 
        in verse their lovers, for instance. Consider this concluding couplet 
        from one of Shakespeare's sonnets:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>So long as men can breath or eyes can see,<br>
          So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The urge to defeat death and escape the ravages of time is a basic motive 
        underlying the creation of all art. If one wishes to fashion immortal 
        verse, to construct, as it were, &quot;a time machine,&quot; one would 
        want one's words to be <em>memorable</em>, and that is part of the 
        job description of the several devices of verse: to aid in giving a poem 
        <em>memorability</em>.<br>
        <br>
        Sooner or later it dawns on most poets that, happily, they have entered 
        a vast, ongoing, and varied conversation that spans the centuries. Through 
        their acts of creative composition they can join the great poet John Donne 
        in saying, &quot;Death, be not proud.&quot; Every poet has at least 
        the hope that his or her work will survive an individual life's 
        span, and art is one of the few tools we have to kick a little sand in 
        the eye of the Grim Reaper. Notice that in this particular bid for eternal 
        fame, Shakespeare chose a rhymed iambic pentameter couplet to preserve 
        his living words. Patterned arrangements of language gain in <em>memorability</em> 
        and offer a leg up in the quest for that immortality poetic art seeks 
        for itself.</p>
      <p><br>
        II.</p>
      <p>Aside from the charm, musicality, and memorability verse lends to poetry, 
        we expect great poetry to display qualities of invention and imagination. 
        The word &quot;poet&quot; means, in Greek, &quot;maker.&quot; To the 
        early Greeks the poet was a creator with singular gifts of inspiration, 
        invention, and composition. The poet invented fables, fictions, myths, 
        and stories that conveyed deep truths about the world and human life. 
        This ability of the poet to create something new and interesting was remarked 
        upon by Shakespeare in <em>A Midsummer Night's Dream</em>:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>The poet's eye in a fine frenzy rolling<br>
          Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven,<br>
          And as imagination bodies forth<br>
          The form of things unknown, the poet's pen<br>
          Turns them to shapes, and gives to airy nothing<br>
          A local habitation and a name.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Of course, the poet doesn't create out of &quot;nothing&quot; 
        and make a world out of whole cloth. His compositions, to have any meaning, 
        must have some relation to the world of human beings and to nature. Given 
        that relation, however, the poet enjoys a great deal of creative freedom. 
        As Sir Phillip Sydney wrote in &quot;An Apology For Poetry,&quot;</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>Only the poet . . . lifted up with the vigor of his own invention . 
          . . goeth<br>
          hand in hand with nature, not enclosed within the narrow warrant of 
          her<br>
          gifts, but freely ranging within the zodiac of his own wit.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The English Romantic poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge considered the faculty 
        of imagination to be a repetition in our finite minds of the immeasurable 
        creativity within the imagination of the infinite &quot;I Am,&quot; 
        or, God. If poets are human exemplars of this divine creative quality, 
        it is little wonder the philosopher Plato stated, &quot;A poet is a light 
        and winged thing, and holy.&quot; One such poet was the American poet 
        Emily Dickinson. A recluse in life, she found an immortal voice in short, 
        powerful verses, such as her 1862 poem, &quot;This Is My Letter to the 
        World&quot;:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>This is my letter to the World<br>
          That never wrote to Me--<br>
          The simple News that Nature told--<br>
          With tender Majesty</p>
        <p>Her Message is committed<br>
          To Hands I cannot see--<br>
          For love of Her--Sweet--countrymen <br>
          Judge tenderly--of Me</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>While many great poets such as Dickinson best express themselves in brief 
        lyrical works, others give us more fully sustained displays of the power 
        of invention: the Italian Dante Alligheri takes us on an incredible tour 
        of Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise in his Divine Comedy; John Milton gives 
        us the rebellious angel Lucifer fighting eternal war against God, with 
        all humanity as both prize and witness, in <em>Paradise Lost</em>; Homer 
        tells of the long homeward journey of a veteran after the Trojan War in 
        <em>The Odyssey</em>, with fascinating episodes of shipwreck, survival, 
        and suspense, building to the final homecoming of Ulysses to his wife 
        and child on the island kingdom of Ithaca, where one final battle awaits 
        him.</p>
      <p>We may note that these stories, legends, and fictions are never told 
        in sweeping, hollow generalities, but the poet always hones in on specific, 
        tactile details, pungent with sensuous imagery, all of which paint startlingly 
        realistic portraits through the use of vivid, accurate language. </p>
      <p>Along with making use of lively detail, the ability of the poet to notice 
        correspondences, similarities, and analogies and to employ these in constructing 
        fresh and original metaphors lies at the heart of great poetry, and is 
        part of its imaginative sweep. The often sensuous, figurative language 
        of simile and metaphor seems to appeal greatly to the human mind. Consider 
        the opening stanza and fifth stanza of &quot;First Snow in Alsace,&quot; 
        by World War II veteran and Pulitzer Prize winner <a href="../authorbios/wilbur.html">Richard 
        Wilbur</a>:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>The snow came down last night like moths<br>
          Burned on the moon; it fell till dawn<br>
          Covered the town with simple cloths.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* * *<br>
          You think: beyond the town a mile<br>
          Or two, this snowfall fills the eyes<br>
          Of soldiers dead a little while.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Here the magical beauty of the first snow is described against the backdrop 
        of war, a contrast made more powerful by the simile comparing of falling 
        snowflakes to dead moths. (Wilbur reads this poem on the <a href="../CD.html">Operation 
        Homecoming CD</a>.)</p>
      <p>Similarly, the seventeenth-century Welsh poet Henry Vaughan formulates 
        a luminous simile and extends it at some length in &quot;The World.&quot; 
        Here is the art of poetry at the top of its form, as revelation through 
        metaphor of profound spiritual vision.</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>I saw eternity the other night<br>
          Like a great ring of pure and endless light,<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All 
          calm as it was bright<br>
          And round beneath it, time, in hours, days, years,<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Driven 
          by the spheres,<br>
          Like a vast shadow moved, in which the world<br>
          And all her train were hurled.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>We can be reasonably sure that we have risen above mere verse at this 
        point and shifted into the higher plane of full-bodied poetry, where qualities 
        of imagination, vision, and invention are seen coming clearly into play. 
        And yet, we have still not touched on one final, vital ingredient of great 
        poetry. </p>
      <p><br>
        III.</p>
      <p>In addition to qualities of memorability, musicality, imagination, and 
        invention, we expect poetry to touch us at an emotional level. Take the 
        passion out of poetry, and we are left with something dry and rather ridiculous. 
        &quot;A poem begins with a lump in the throat, a homesickness or love-sickness,&quot; 
        said Robert Frost. &quot;It is a reaching out toward expression; an effort 
        to find fulfillment.&quot; The great English poet William Wordsworth 
        said, &quot;Poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings: 
        it takes its origin from emotion recollected in tranquility.&quot; According 
        to Wordsworth, the urge to write begins with a person's strong feelings. 
        This is what impels human beings to break from silence into utterance.</p>
      <p>A poem may be admirable because it grants us an insight into some truth 
        about ourselves or the universe we inhabit. It may engage in abstruse 
        aesthetic projects or metaphysical speculations that are intellectually 
        quite sophisticated. Conversely, it may be simple and direct, and those 
        are often the most powerful kinds of poems. Think, for instance, of how 
        we might savor a sad blues song. One doesn't need advanced degrees 
        to appreciate a line like, &quot;I woke up this morning, blues all around 
        my bed,&quot; or &quot;Oh, I hate to see that evenin' sun go down.&quot; 
        Lines like these come from the heart and are meant to touch other hearts. 
        Consider this anonymously written fragment of English poetry from the 
        early sixteenth century:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>Western wind, when wilt thou blow<br>
          That the small rain down can rain?<br>
          Christ, that my love were in my arms,<br>
          And I in my bed again!</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>We don't know the full situation of the speaker here, but there 
        is no mistaking the heartfelt longing for home in the voice. It is that 
        unmistakable human passion that has caused this scrap of poetry to live 
        for more than five hundred years.</p>
      <p>There is a fine line between the poem which makes an authentic claim 
        upon the core of our emotional being and the poem which seems to wish 
        to manipulate us, to play insincerely, or ineptly, upon our heartstrings. 
        When dealing with emotionally charged matter, the poet faces the danger 
        of lapsing into sentimentality or bathos, of buttonholing the reader and 
        trading upon what has been called &quot;unearned emotion.&quot; One 
        could fill up Yankee Stadium several times over with all of the mawkishly 
        sentimental drivel passing itself off as genuine poetry that has fallen 
        on the wrong side of this line. It is perhaps the commonest of faults 
        among inexperienced writers, and even great poets are not immune to this 
        kind of error. Consider this line by Shelley:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>I fall upon the thorns of life&#8212;I bleed!</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The question arises, has Shelley gone too far into self-pity and sentimentality 
        here? Many readers and critics tend to think he shows a momentary lapse 
        of taste.<br>
        <br>
        Though quite real, self-pity is often considered an unlovely human emotion. 
        Yet, because it is human and because nothing human is outside the scope 
        of the poet's pen, a great poet like Shakespeare can examine it, 
        even confess it, honestly. Fortunately, in the following sonnet, he also 
        points the way out of the emotional swamp of self-pity.<br>
        <br>
        Notice how, toward the end of the poem, there is a change in the direction 
        of the thought, a swerving or veering, as if from a thesis to an antithesis, 
        or from a problem stated to a resolution discovered. This shift is quite 
        typical of the sonnet's structure, and is one of its traditional 
        hallmarks. At the beginning the author is wallowing in self-pity, down 
        on himself, and depressed. He discovers that the way out of his thoughts 
        of self is to think on another, his lover, and the entire mood of the 
        poem is lightened, ending on a note of celebration. <br>
        When in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes,</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>I all alone beweep my outcast state,<br>
          And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,<br>
          And look upon myself, and curse my fate,<br>
          Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,<br>
          Featured like him, like him with friends possessed,<br>
          Desiring this man's art and that man's scope,<br>
          With what I most enjoy contented least;<br>
          Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,<br>
          Haply I think on thee; and then my state<br>
          Like to the lark at break of day arising<br>
          From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate;<br>
          For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings<br>
          That then I scorn to change my state with kings.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>If there are hidden laws of the operation and economy of our human emotions, 
        no class of investigators or interpreters have studied and observed them 
        more closely or with greater results than the poets. The founder of psychotherapy 
        Dr. Sigmund Freud resorted time and again to the poets and playwrights 
        to discover the terms with which to describe fundamental motives and workings 
        of the human mind. Shakespeare's plays and poems alone constitute 
        a veritable textbook on the inner workings of human behavior.<br>
        <br>
        Poets not only accurately describe and analyze powerful emotions, they 
        also convey or evoke them. Sometimes, as in the following poem by William 
        Blake, they seem to do both. Some inner laws of the operations of malice 
        and vengeance are described, and the speaker finally embodies these emotions, 
        which gives the analysis an added, high-voltage charge.</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>A POISON TREE<br>
          I was angry with my friend:<br>
          I told my wrath, my wrath did end.<br>
          I was angry with my foe:<br>
          I told it not, my wrath did grow.<br>
          And I watered it in fears,<br>
          Night and morning with my tears;<br>
          I sunned it with smiles<br>
          And with soft deceitful wiles.<br>
          And it grew both day and night,<br>
          Till it bore an apple bright;<br>
          And my foe beheld it shine,<br>
          And he knew that it was mine,<br>
          And into my garden stole<br>
          When the night had veiled the pole:<br>
          In the morning glad I see<br>
          My foe outstretched beneath the tree.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Emotion is also the motivating force of most poems of political protest 
        and social criticism. The smarting wince we feel when we witness an injustice 
        may turn quickly to anger, outrage, and indignation. The same cry against 
        oppression and the abuse of power and wealth sounded by the Old Testament 
        prophets (such as Isaiah or Jeremiah) can be heard throughout English 
        and American poetry and down to the present day.</p>
      <p>At the time of the great flowering of English Romanticism, the British 
        government had retrenched into a reactionary stance, halting or reversing 
        much-needed societal reforms in fear and horror of the excesses of the 
        French Revolution, raging across the English Channel. It was a time of 
        abject political reversal for the liberal poets, who envisioned mankind 
        progressing toward a freer and more equable society. Witness part of Shelley's 
        devastating summary of the situation from &quot;England in 1819&quot;:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>An old, mad, blind, despised, and dying king;<br>
          Princes, the dregs of their dull race, who flow<br>
          Through public scorn,---mud from a muddy spring:<br>
          Rulers, who neither see, nor feel, nor know,<br>
          But, leech-like, to their fainting country cling<br>
          Till they drop, blind in blood, without a blow;<br>
          A people starved and stabbed in the untilled field;<br>
          An army which liberticide and prey<br>
          Makes as a two-edged sword to all who wield;</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>This same despair of wretched social, moral and political conditions 
        brought this damning indictment from Blake a few years earlier in &quot;London.&quot;</p>
      <p>I wander through each chartered street,<br>
        Near where the chartered Thames does flow,<br>
        And mark in every face I meet<br>
        Marks of weakness, marks of woe.</p>
      <p>Reforms envisioned by the British poets eventually came to England, and 
        it is not far fetched at all to state that England's poets spurred 
        this progress. Perhaps Shelley did not overreach when he said, &quot;Poets 
        are the unacknowledged legislators of the world.&quot; When poets harness 
        their outrage and channel it into emotionally powerful poems of social 
        or political persuasion, their art is often in service to humanity in 
        its quest for liberty and justice.</p>
      <p>IV.</p>
      <p>With the music of verse, richness of description, the wonder of creative 
        imagination, marvels of metaphor, and the force of emotion, poetry can 
        educate, ennoble, motivate, and enlighten us. Poetry can also help us 
        appreciate the plenitude, brevity, and beauty of human life. I hope I 
        have given in this essay some idea of how these elements, coming together, 
        constitute what we might mean by the word &quot;poetry.&quot; Poetry 
        need not be hemmed in by a formulaic definition, and would be sure to 
        break out of it if it were.</p>
      <p>Many of you reading this are presently wearing the uniform of one of 
        the branches of the Armed Services, or are perhaps closely related to 
        a service member. I want to tell you briefly about four men who served 
        in the military during World War II. One of these studied the rhymes of 
        Edgar Allen Poe while scrunched down in a foxhole in Italy, trying not 
        to get his head blown off. Another was present at the liberation of the 
        Nazi extermination camps, and grappled with this in his poetry. Another 
        fought at the Battle of the Bulge. In later life, each of these four went 
        on to publish their own work, and each of them in their turn received 
        the coveted Pulitzer Prize in poetry. Two of them were appointed United 
        States Poet Laureate. Today their poems have entered into the great canon 
        of American literature, where they will remain for succeeding generations 
        to enjoy. Their names are <a href="../authorbios/wilbur.html">Richard 
        Wilbur</a>, Louis Simpson, Howard 
        Nemerov, and Anthony Hecht, and they were soldiers as well as poets. Some 
        sixty years after they faced battle as young men, Wilbur and Simpson recorded 
        their war poems for the <a href="../CD.html">Operation Homecoming CD</a> 
        to help today's troops better process their own wartime experiences. 
        The lives and works of these four men indicate that there is no inherent 
        conflict between military service and a love of poetry. </p>
