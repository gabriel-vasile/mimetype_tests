    <p>We define database terms as follows. A <i>flat file</i> is a collection of data

    organized in columns and rows, pertinent to a given subject. A data table showing various

    parameters from Lake Pontchartrain and surroundings (<a href="dbconsol.htm">Table 1</a>)

    is an example. This is the way earth scientists, who often deal with very complex systems,

    have traditionally collected and analyzed data. Spreadsheets like Microsoft Excel are a

    popular way to display, manipulate, and create plots and diagrams from flat files. </p>

    <p>Potential confusion emerges from two interpretations of &quot;relational database

    systems&quot;. A broad use of the term relational would refer to database systems that

    relate different data tables to each other and, therefore, are capable of querying these

    tables to extract information. Database management software like Microsoft Access serves

    this purpose in the current work (<a href="dbquery.htm">Fig. 1</a>). However, database

    systems professionals commonly adopt the specific conventions of the &quot;relational

    model&quot; introduced by E.F. Codd of the IBM corporation in 1970 (Walters, 1987, p.46),

    taking the definition one step farther. This model uses formal mathematical rules of set

    theory and relational algebra to arrange the tables and their relationships in a manner

    that prevents anomalies from occurring while inserting, updating or deleting data. The

    guidelines for this system, called &quot;normalization&quot;, require that every row

    (tuple) have a primary key; the attributes in a relational table must depend on the

    primary key; and the nonkey attributes in the table must be independent of each other. In

    other words, complex data systems are broken up into their most fundamental relationships

    to form tables, each of which must have a primary key, and which generally have less than

    25 fields (columns). An example of such a relational system (with minor modifications)

    applied to sediment chemistry is provided in <a href="emapfig2.htm">Figure 2</a> and <a href="emaptable.htm">Table 2</a> (data from the U.S. Environmental Protection

    Agency&#146;s EMAP program). </p>

    <p>This system allows computer database managers to manipulate very large and complex

    databases with flexibility and efficiency. <em>Normalized</em> tables are essential in a

    very large database, especially one containing data that requires frequent updating. A

    table which is not <em>normalized</em> may contain data that is dependent on other data or

    entries that are repeated. This causes significant difficulties in maintaining the

    internal consistency (integrity) of the database while updating the data. </p>

    <p>The disadvantage of removing all dependencies is that these may be the principle

    features that scientists use to compare and analyze data.&nbsp; Although such

    relationships could be stored or recreated in query structures, this process may require

    services of professional or experienced database managers. For smaller databases, it may

    be possible to reduce the need for such expertise and recombination of data by keeping the

    database structure in formats convenient to the main user needs.</p>

    <a name="horizontal"><i><p></i><strong>&quot;Horizontal&quot; vs. &quot;Vertical&quot;

    format</strong></a></p>

    <p>The Pontchartrain database (containing about 90,000 descriptors and measurements) uses

    a mixed databasing system. It departs from the classical relational model by allowing

    multiple dependent fields. However, this kind of structure is not a problem since the data

    are essentially static. The majority of the updates involve adding new records but not

    changing what already has been entered. The structure displays the parameters in a

    &quot;horizontal&quot; format, meaning the chemical constituents are the field names

    stretching across the table horizontally (<a href="horiz.htm">Table 3</a>). Such

    structures differ from the format used in <a href="emaptable.htm">Table 2</a> which shows

    the chemical constituents listed vertically in one column, repeating for each station. The

    <em>horizontal</em> format allows the scientist to more conveniently view, compare, sort

    and associate data that intuitively belong together. The tables may have hundreds of

    fields rather than be limited to a few tens of fields as in the vertical format, but the

    horizontal format obviously requires a fewer number of records. Database Mangagement

    System (DBMS) software like Microsoft Access is nearly unlimited in the number of records

    it can manage (2 billion per table), but the latest version of Microsoft Excel only allows

    65,536 records. The horizontal table structure allows storage and use in both Excel and

    Access. Even though they are related by a unique identification number and can be queried

    by DBMS software, some computer specialists may still refer to the tables as <em>flat

    files</em> because of the horizontal format which is not <em>normalized</em>.</p>

    <table border="0" width="100%">

      <tr>

        <td width="80%">Although the current database's total storage capacity is small in

        comparison with industrial or agency databases, it has many complex parameters and

        properties . The development and interactive use of the database throughout both the data

        processing and interpretative phases (<a href="../images/dbflow2.gif">Fig. 3</a>) offers

        parallels to large industrial database systems with their feedback loops to data sources

        and customers. Industrial managers now use &quot;data mining&quot; to perform statistical

        analysis and modeling techniques to uncover patterns and relationships hidden in an

        organization's database (Edelstein, 1998). This intelligent data querying and exploration

        of data resources helps uncover new relationships rather than merely providing answers to

        standard queries as traditional databases have done. Data mining likewise implies the

        necessity for continuous modification of database structures, another feature of the

        present work.</td>
