    <p>We define database terms as follows. A <i>flat file</i> is a collection of data
    organized in columns and rows, pertinent to a given subject. A data table showing various
    parameters from Lake Pontchartrain and surroundings (<a href="dbconsol.htm">table 1</a>)
    is an example. This is the way earth scientists, who often deal with very complex systems,
    have traditionally collected and analyzed data. Using spreadsheets like Microsoft&reg; Excel
    is a
    popular way to display, manipulate, and create plots and diagrams from flat files. </p>

    <p>Potential confusion emerges from two interpretations of &quot;relational database
    systems&quot;. A broad use of the term relational would refer to database systems that
    relate different data tables to each other and, therefore, are capable of querying these
    tables to extract information. Database management software like Microsoft&reg; Access serves
    this purpose in the current work (<a href="dbquery.htm">fig. 1</a>). However, database
    systems professionals commonly adopt the specific conventions of the &quot;relational
    model&quot; introduced by E.F. Codd of the IBM corporation in 1970 (Walters, 1987,
    p. 46),
    taking the definition one step farther. This model uses formal mathematical rules of set
    theory and relational algebra to arrange the tables and their relationships in a manner
    that prevents anomalies from occurring while data are inserted, updated, or
    deleted. The
    guidelines for this system, called &quot;normalization&quot;, require that every row
    (tuple) have a primary key, the attributes in a relational table must depend on the
    primary key, and the nonkey attributes in the table must be independent of each other. In
    other words, complex data systems are broken up into their most fundamental relationships
    to form tables, each of which must have a primary key, and which generally have less than
    25 fields (columns). An example of such a relational system (with minor modifications)
    applied to sediment chemistry is provided in <a href="emapfig2.htm">figure 2</a> and <a href="emaptab.htm">table 2</a> (data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&#146;s
    EMAP program). </p>
    <p>This system allows computer database managers to manipulate very large and complex
    databases with flexibility and efficiency. Normalized tables are essential in a
    very large database, especially one containing data that require frequent updating. A
    table that is not normalized may contain data that is dependent on other data or
    entries that are repeated, which causes significant difficulties in maintaining the
    internal consistency (integrity) of the database. </p>
    <p>The disadvantage of removing all dependencies is that these are precisely the
    relationships scientists use to compare and analyze data.&nbsp;Although database
    management software is designed to be able to create queries showing desired combinations
    of data, this action requires services of professional or experienced staff. The need for such
    specialized experience may be reduced by storing the data in a format deemed
    convenient for general users, that is, tables containing some
    dependencies and, consequently, not entirely normalized. This format
    was chosen for the Pontchartrain database because the advantages of less frequent querying
    and easy conversion back to a spreadsheet outweighed any drawbacks to having unnormalized
    tables.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>  <a name="horizontal"><strong>&quot;Horizontal&quot; versus &quot;vertical&quot;
    format</strong></a></p>
    <p>The Pontchartrain database uses
    a mixed database system. It departs from the classical relational model by allowing
    multiple dependent fields. This structure is acceptable because the data are essentially
    static. The majority of the updates involve adding new records but not changing what
    already has been entered. The structure displays the parameters in a
    &quot;horizontal&quot; format, meaning the chemical constituents are the field names
    stretching across the table horizontally (<a href="horiz.htm">table 3</a>). Such
    structures differ from the format used in <a href="emaptab.htm">table 2</a>, which shows
    the chemical constituents listed vertically in one column, repeating for each station. The
    horizontal format allows the scientist to more conveniently view, compare, sort,
    and associate data that intuitively belong together. The tables may have hundreds of
    fields rather than be limited to a few tens of fields as in the vertical format, but the
    horizontal format obviously requires a fewer number of records. The latest version of
    Microsoft&reg; Excel allows a maximum of 65,536 records, but Database Mangagement System
    (DBMS) software like Microsoft&reg; Access is much less limited in the number of records it
    can manage (maximum size of a table is 1 gigabyte). The horizontal table structure allows
    storage and use in both Excel and Access. Even though they are related by a unique
    identification number and can be queried by DBMS software, some still refer to the tables
    as flat files because of the horizontal format, which is not normalized.</p>

      <tr>
        <td width="80%">Although the current database's total storage capacity is small in
        comparison with industrial or agency databases, it has many complex parameters and
        properties. The development and interactive use of the database throughout both the data
        processing and interpretative phases (<a href="../images/dbflow2.gif">fig. 3</a>)
          offer
        parallels to large industrial database systems with their feedback loops to data sources
        and customers. Industrial managers now use &quot;data mining&quot; to perform statistical
        analysis and modeling techniques to uncover patterns and relationships hidden in an
        organization's database (Edelstein, 1998). This intelligent data querying and exploration
        of data resources helps to uncover new relationships rather than merely
          to provide answers to
        standard queries, as traditional databases have done. Data mining likewise implies the
        necessity for continuous modification of database structures, another feature of the
        present work.</td>
