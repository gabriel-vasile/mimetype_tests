<H2> RDBMS - Relational DataBase Management System </H2>
<UL>

<LI> A Relational Database Management System or RDBMS is a software
program for storing and retreiving data objects or entities by
specifying particular relationships between some of the entities.<P>

<LI> The RDBMS used with the PDD project is a system designed and
built by the <A HREF="http://www-ips.ncifcrf.gov:469/">Image
Processing Section</A> in the LMMB of the NCI/FCRDC.<P>

<LI>The query and data manipulation language used in the RDBMS
system is a subset of <A HREF="SQL.html">SQL query language</A> with
some DBaseIV constructs.<P>

<LI>The RDBMS program used with the PDD is memory based (rather than
disk file based). This gives a major performance advantage when the
database is small enough to fit in memory.<P>

<LI>The RDBMS program uses "threads" type light weight processes and
currently runs on SUN computers under SUNOS-4.1.X and SOLARIS-2.3.<P>

<LI> Startup of the RDBMS server daemon consists of first loading
the PDD tables into memory. This is fast and takes just a few seconds.
Then it listens for client SQL command requests.<P>

<LI> RDBMS server access is restricted through security features where
different access groups have different corresponding sets of command
capabilities.<P>

<LI> Entry of new data to the PDD is a maintenance operation with
access restricted accordingly. When a change is made to the database
residing it memory, the affected tables are saved back out to disk in
an atomic operations as table files. Older versions of the RDBMS table
files are renamed with timestamp so recovery is possible if necessary.<P>
