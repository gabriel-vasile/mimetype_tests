<EM>This paper describes the development of <em> AMASE</em>,
an astrophysics catalog, which uses object-oriented 
database (OODB) technology to facilitate access to NASA's 
multi-mission and multi-spectral astrophysics data holdings. The 
catalog is an on-line metadatabase consisting of scientific reference 
pointers to enable easy location of low-level space astrophysics data 
in the public archives. 
The metadatabase catalog contains both descriptions of mission-oriented 
data and published astrophysics catalog data.
We use OODB techniques to classify data 
products with scientific attributes, enabling queries across mission 
and spectral boundaries of data residing in heterogeneous databases.  
We discuss the advantages of using an object-relational 
database (a hybrid of object-oriented and relational database 
technologies) to mitigate many of the problems that arise in using 
pure relational technology.

<H2><A NAME=SECTION00010000000000000000>1 Introduction</A></H2>
<P>
Astrophysical data analysis demands efficient access to large 
volume of complex data.  
NASA data sets in the data
archives are structured with a mission perspective. 
These data sets are products of space missions 
and, hence, are stored in the archives according to mission-specific 
parameters, in disparate mass storage systems and in different 
formats.  This is largely a historical development, reflecting the 
evolution of computers and mass storage technology in the past 30 
years.
<P>
Scientists often wish to conduct research that cuts across mission boundaries,
and would do so more often were it not so challenging to locate and understand
unfamiliar data sets.  It is generally advantageous, for example, to use
multi-wavelength observations to interpret a class of celestial objects.  Yet
it is currently necessary to learn the specific structure of each NASA mission
data archive before one can determine whether the relevant data exist and then
access them. The internet has provided different means for scientists to
access the mission data centers through Web browsers, FTP, Gopher or
customized interfaces. But the procedures to locate data granules is dependent
on the services provided by the individual data center. The user has to know a
priori  which data archive to search.  Some mission archives have built
interfaces to make the underlying database structure transparent to the users.
 Nonetheless, the search is conducted one data set at a time and one mission
at a time, and the researcher must integrate information gleaned from the
various catalogs.  The problem is exacerbated if the user is unfamiliar with
the data products generated by a particular mission and thus does not even
know where to begin. A uniform, multi-mission and multi-spectral user
interface to these heterogeneous data holdings is surely needed.
<P>
This paper describes the development of <em> AMASE</em>, an astrophysics
metadatabase catalog system using object-oriented database (OODB) technology
to facilitate access to NASA's multi-mission and multi-spectral astrophysics
data holdings. The AMASE catalog is an on-line metadatabase consisting of
scientific reference pointers to enable easy location of low-level space
astrophysics data in the public archives. We use OODB techniques to classify
data products with scientific attributes, enabling queries across mission and
spectral boundaries residing in heterogeneous databases.  The AMASE contains
both descriptions of mission-oriented data and published astrophysics catalog
data.
<P>
Section 2 of this paper discusses the rationale for using OODB technology.
Section 3 discusses the schema design.  Section 4 describes the query
capability and the HTML interface.  Finally, the conclusions are in Section 5.
<P>
<H2><A NAME=SECTION00020000000000000000>2 Adopted Object-Oriented Database
Design Paradigm</A></H2>
<P>
Traditionally, relational databases are used to represent the 
astrophysics catalogs.  However, due to the hierarchical nature of 
many of the data relationships, an object-oriented approach results in 
a data model which more closely mirrors the structure of the data.  
The Object-Oriented Database (OODB) paradigm allows greater
flexibility in characterizing classes of objects and can provide a
``scientific'' view into the heterogeneous multi-variate catalogs.
<P>
The second and perhaps more important reason for choosing OODB is that a
significant fraction of the metadata are either in semi-structured  form,
e.g., documentation in free text, or have complex data types none of which is
supported by traditional relational systems. For example, data types such as
celestial positions, with implicit transformation between different coordinate
systems, are required to support spatial queries. Furthermore, many of these
complex data types are linked together via arbitrary programs (methods) to
form other high level of objects.  Such as objects cannot be built using SQL
statements on normalized relations for the reason that they are arbitrary and
data driven.  None of these are supported by traditional relational database
technology.
<P>
The third compelling  reason for the OODB approach is heterogeneity of the
astrophysics  catalogs and their data. Seemingly similar attributes may have
different calibration, different units, and even different interpretation. 
The OO approach allows us to apply different algorithms depending on the data
source as necessary.
<P>
Despite the limited modeling capabilities of traditional relational database
systems, they offer maturity, robustness, and predictable performance. A
central tenet of our approach to building AMASE is to accommodate access to
existing astrophysics databases. They constitute a huge investment over many
years and the information in them is a key NASA asset.  It would be
impractical to require that these databases be ported to a new database system
and their application programs be rewritten for this new database.  Since many
of these are implemented in relational systems, interoperability of these
systems with AMASE is essential.  The Object-Relational system provides the
right hooks and tools for such interoperation.
<P>
For this reason we were compelled to use the hybrid <em> Object-Relational</em>
approach which combines the advantages of both worlds. We selected Illustra as
a platform for AMASE. Illustra is a commercial Object-Relational DBMS which
offers the advantages of the OODB modeling and the ease of writing SQL-like
queries. It supports SQL3 OO features such as inheritance, polymorphism, and
user defined data types. One of the most important data type that were found
necessary for the search is spatial data type and its underlying spatial
R-tree indexing. Finally, Illustra allows access to relational systems through
<em> datablades</em>, such as Sybase, and others will be available soon.  It
is one of the primary goals of AMASE to interoperate with legacy systems and
Illustra provides an appropriate platform for achieving it.
<P>
<H2><A NAME=SECTION00030000000000000000>3 AMASE Database Design</A></H2>
<P>
NASA astrophysics data holdings are structured in AMASE with the
``scientific'' perspective. Astrophysicists can search for a class of
celestial objects by characterizing their data requirements in scientific
parameters without knowledge of the location of the distributed data holdings,
the number of missions and the interfaces to all the storage data systems. 
AMASE provides a uniform user interface which supports global  multi-mission
and multi-spectral searches, across heterogeneous and distributed data
holdings just as if they were stored inside a single database.
<P>
Two missions in different wavelength bands and with different mission
operations philosophy were selected to demonstrate the multi-mission and
multi-spectral search capability. ROSAT is an X-ray mission that is still
operating, with data gathered from pointed observations by guest
investigators.  IRAS was an infrared mission that was operated mainly in the
scanning mode.  The available data products from these missions were reviewed
and parameterized for input into AMASE. We decided to store only fundamental
astronomical measurements that will help locate low-level data.  Derived
quantities will be generated dynamically by algorithms stored in the OODB.
Data products in the archives are referenced by hypertext pointers. 
Currently, the pointers  bring up the appropriate data request form of the data
center and instructions on how to access the particular data set. Eventually,
the data retrieval information will be built into the database and made
transparent to the user.
<P>
We seek to encapsulate the existing data, metadata, associated documentation
and analysis software into ``objects'' in our catalog, anticipating the
complex requirements in the course of scientific inquiries.  The scientific
attributes include fundamental astronomical measurements such as name of
object, position, coordinates, flux, spectral bandpass, surface brightness,
color, velocity, proper motion and redshift, as well as astronomical
classification.  These attributes are generally available in published
astronomical catalogs.
<P>
The design of AMASE is to capture these relevant information from the
astronomical catalogs and use them as criteria to search the mission data
archives.  The mission data are described using attributes gleaned from the
mission timelines, target lists and observation logs that are generated
directly from the FITS headers of data files in the archives.  These
attributes include pointing position, observation time, instrument
configuration and name of primary target.  Other information such as the
instrument field of view, spectral coverage and operation time span are also
captured by the search algorithms to augment the search and provide the user
with ``supplementary information''.

In AMASE, all the scientific attributes and mission data attributes are linked
to an ``Astronomical Object''.  An ``Astronomical Object'' can be a single
astronomical object, a class of astronomical objects, or an abstract class
with well-defined scientific attributes.  A hierarchy of astronomical
``classes'' has been defined in the object-oriented database so that a child
class inherit all the attributes of the parent class.  For example, an active
galaxy is characterized by all the attributes of the ``galaxy'' class, plus
some additional attributes that are specific to the ``active galaxy'' class.
The attributes can be Radio Loud and Nuclear Activity.  The schema also
support astronomical name aliases. When a user queries for science data, the
search criteria are issued against the ``Astronomical Object'' while the query
results returned are in terms of mission data descriptors. The mission data
descriptors identify the names of the relevant mission data sets, archive
location and retrieval information.
<P>
We also designed a hierarchy of types. We defined position types for multiple
coordinate system including galactic, ecliptic, and equatorial.  We modeled
the positional uncertainty of multiple instruments and calibration techniques,
spectral types, variability, uncertainty, and extinction. We finally defined
methods specifically to handle positional uncertainty, spectral variability,
and flux sensitivity,
<P>
We aggregated instrument, position, and wave-length types  into classes such
AstronomicalObject and ObservationEntry. Names, positions, and spectral types
are extracted from published catalogs and linked to the NASA mission catalog
via the class of AstronomicalObject. Another feature of the design captures
references to on-line data, mission proposals, targets and time-lines.
<P>
The schema of the classes used in AMASE is shown in Figures 1 and 2.

<H2><A NAME=SECTION00040000000000000000>4 The AMASE System
Implementation</A></H2>
<P>
This section describes the system's query capabilities and its interface. In
the prototype, emphasis was primarily given to the basic functionality of the
system although we also tried to improve performance using advanced indexing
and replication techniques.
<P>
AMASE runs on an SGI Indigo-2 workstation, with a 40-GB magneto-optical
jukebox and a stand alone DLT tape drive as secondary storage.
<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION00041000000000000000>4.1 Advanced Query Capability</A></H3>
<P>
In addition to the query capability provided by Illustra, AMASE supports three
categories  of astrophysics specific queries: Name/Alias retrieval,
Positional, and astronomical object class:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Name/Alias: given a name or an alias, retrieve all instances of
astronomical and their positions.  One of the retrieved positions may be used
to formulate a region-based query centered on this position.

<LI>Position-based: given a position and a radius, retrieve all instances of
CatalogEntry and ObservationEntry, or
<P>
given a rectangular region specified by the end-points of its diagonal,
retrieve all instances of CatalogEntry and ObservationEntry.
<P>
<LI>
Astronomical class query: retrieve all CatalogEntry and ObservationEntry of a
given class and type,  e.g. Seyfert1 galaxy, Radio Loud.
<P>
</UL>
<P>
Among the OO features of Illustra, we capitalize on its built-in spatial data
type, access and manipulation functions, procedures to facilitate point and
region queries. We also use reference types to link object classes and
collection types to support multi-valued attributes, e.g multiple aliases of
an AstronomicalObject. Special purpose methods are used to retrieve and convert
class specific  attribute values.
<P>
Figures 3, 4 and 5 show some of the queries supported by AMASE in their HTML
format and the produced output.

<P><H3><A NAME=SECTION00042000000000000000>4.2 The HTML User Interface</A></H3>
<P>
We have designed and implemented an HTML interface to AMASE to provide
accessibility to remote users. It consists of a sequence of forms and result
pages.  The forms include radio buttons, data entry fields, and push buttons
grouped into centered tables for presentation. The selection and data entry
fields are validated against methods built in the HTML interface which at the
same time take care of coordinate transformation (from simple translation to
precession). The forms execute ``cgi'' based code that invokes the underlying
queries and generates HTML formatted the output.  Embedded in or associated
with displayed objects are links to external catalogs and/or data archives.
<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION00043000000000000000>4.3 Data Entry </A></H3>
<P>
<P>
We have populated the database with approximately 40,000 astronomical objects
from selected regions of the sky, specifying position (galactic, ecliptical
and equatorial), type, wavelength band, object name aliases etc.  We populated
several other classes (of equivalent cardinality) which encapsulate primary
and derived observation data and published astronomical catalog information.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME=SECTION00050000000000000000>5 Conclusion and Future Work </A></H2>
<P>
In this paper we described AMASE an astrophysics catalog, which uses
object-oriented database (OODB) technology to facilitate access to NASA's
multi-mission and multi-spectral astrophysics data holdings. We capitalized on
OODB techniques to classify data products with scientific attributes, enabling
queries across mission and spectral boundaries residing in heterogeneous
databases. We discussed the advantages of using an object-relational database
(a hybrid of object-oriented and relational database technologies) to mitigate
many of the problems that arise in using pure relational technology.
<P>
Our immediate goal is to increase the database of AMASE by including  more
catalog and observation entries from other NASA missions. We also plan to
increase the query capability by allowing ``data mining'', for example
searching for ``proximity'' of objects, variability and uncertainty of
retrieval values. We also plan to develop semiautomatic tools to extract
pertinent information from raw files in FITS format.
