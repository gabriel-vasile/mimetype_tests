Numerous repositories for molecular biology data are implemented using commercial relational
database management systems (DBMSs). These DBMSs provide reliable facilities for managing
data in molecular biology databases (MBDs) such as the Genome Sequence Data Base (GSDB),
but do not provide constructs for directly representing application-specific objects, such as
sequences and alleles: such objects are usually represented by disconnected tuples that are
scattered among multiple tables. Interacting with MBDs implemented using relational DBMSs can
be substantially simplified by providing these MBDs with object oriented interfaces for examining
(browsing and querying) their structure and content, and thus insulating users and applications
from the underlying DBMSs.<P> 

The first step of developing an object-oriented interface for a relational MBD is constructing an
object view for the MBD. For most MBDs, constructing such a view cannot be carried out
automatically. It is often hard to determine algorithmically what tables represent classes of objects
and what tables represent attributes (e.g., set-valued attributes) that cannot be represented as
columns in the tables representing classes. Furthermore, the foreign-key information which is
essential for determining the relationships between different classes of objects is often missing in
relational MBD definitions. Consequently, an interactive procedure is needed for filling in the
missing information and/or determining the structure of the desired object view for a relational
MBD.<P> 

We have developed a retrofitting tool that allows constructing and maintaining object views on
top of existing relational MBDs, without affecting the structure and content of MBDs, and
therefore without disturbing existing applications based these MBDs. This tool is based on the
Object-Protocol Model (OPM). OPM provides constructs for modeling objects and protocols
(laboratory experiments) specific to molecular biology applications.[1] The OPM retrofitting tool
generates a canonical OPM view using all the available information on the relational MBD, and
provides facilities for interactively refining the OPM view by renaming classes and attributes,
changing the value classes of attributes, hiding classes and attributes from the view, defining new
derived classes and attributes, grouping simple attributes into tuple attributes, adding and
removing classes and attributes, merging and splitting classes, and so on.<P>

Once an OPM view has been developed for a relational MBD, the object-oriented interface on
top of the MBD is provided by the OPM data management tools. The OPM retrofitting tool has
been applied for constructing an OPM view for Genome Sequence Data Base (GSDB) 2.2 in
order to allow using the OPM browsing and querying tools on top of GSDB 2.2.<P>
