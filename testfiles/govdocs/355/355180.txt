EXTRA-TEGIES
------------
This package contains the strategies: FIELD, CANCEL-BY, and some other
"extra-tegies". Most of the strategies in this package act on relational
formulas, i.e., arithmetic formulas having the form e [] f, where [] is one
of =,<,<=,>,=>.

FIELD
-----
FIELD is a semi-decision procedure for the field of real numbers.  It was 
originally based on Field of Coq V7 (Mayero, Delahaye), but it has been 
extensively adapted to cope with PVS idiosyncrasies. First, it removes 
inverses, and then it simplifies using PVS decision procedures. It also tries 
to prove that inverses are not null.

The strategy was implemented in collaboration with Micaela Mayero
(Micaela.Mayero@inria.fr).

CANCEL-BY
---------
CANCEL-BY tries to eliminate a common term in both sides of a relational 
formula. First, it divides by the common term, then it distributes, and 
finally,  it simplifies the expressions using PVS decision procedures. 
It also tries to prove that the common term is not null.

OTHER STRATEGIES
---------------
GRIND-REALS   : Applies GRIND with real_props and extra_real_props.
REAL-PROPS    : Applies AUTO-REWRITE on real_props and extra_real_props.
NAME-DISTRIBS : Introduces new names to block distributive laws in a 
                relational formula.
REPLACES      : Iterates REPLACE using a list of formulas.

NEG-FORMULA   : Negates both sides of a relational formula.
ADD-FORMULAS  : Adds two relational formulas.
WRAP-FORMULA  : Wraps both sides of a relational formula with a string.
SPLASH        : Asymmetrically splits a conjunction in the consequent 
               (or a disjunction in the antecedent).


INSTALLATION
------------
0. Install Ben Di Vito package for manipulation of arithmetic expressions. It
   is available at: 
   http://shemesh.larc.nasa.gov/fm/ftp/larc/PVS2-library/pvslib.html.

1. Untar gzip the file field.<xx>.tgz, where <xx> denotes the version number 
   (currently 1g). 

2. You must have at least the following files in the directory Field.<xx>/
- README: This file
- extra-tegies: support strategies
- field-strategies: FIELD and CANCEL-BY
- test.pvs: Some examples
- new.pvs: More examples. Some of them are just intended to show the 
           functionality of the strategies, without having any logical 
           meaning.
- extend/extra_tegies.pvs: An extension to the prelude library
- extend/extra_tegies.prf: Proof file of extra_tegies.pvs
- extend/extra_tegies.bin: Binary file of extra_tegies.bin
- extend/.pvscontex: Context of extend directory

3. Copy the directory Field.<xx> wherever you want it. Let's say <path>.

4. Include in your pvs-strategies file the lines (<path> should be expanded):
(load "<path>/Field.<xx>/extra-tegies")
(load "<path>/Field.<xx>/field-strategies")

5. Include in your .pvsemacs file the line (<path> should be expanded):
(load-prelude-library "<path>/Field.<xx>/extend")

EXAMPLES
--------
Check the file test.pvs for examples. Some of them are taken from 
actual developments at ICASE-NASA LaRC.

The file test.pvs imports reals@sqrt. It assumes that you 
have installed NASA LaRC library "reals", which is available at: 
http://shemesh.larc.nasa.gov/ftp/larc/PVS-library/pvslib.html. However, you do
not need it to use FIELD, or any other of the strategies in this package.
