      Title: West Hawaii Aquarium Project 1999-2003 Fish and Substrate Data (NODC Accession 0001467)
  Description: 
    Abstract: In response to declines in reef fishes, the Hawaii state legislature
      created the West Hawaii Regional Fishery Management Area in 1998 to
      improve fishery resources (Act 306).  The West Hawaii Aquarium Project
      (WHAP) was funded by the Hawaii Coral Reef Initiative to monitor to
      fish populations and quantify the habitats in this region.  This
      dataset consists of an MS Access relational database of all
      monitoring data from 1999-2003.  The relational database
      of this dataset includes some of the data held in
      NODC Accession 0000938, however, it would be best to examine
      each accession carefully.  The relational database of this
      accession has fewer tables and less parameters.
      
      During initial funding under CRAMP in 1998-99, 23 permanent study sites
      were established positioned in all of the proposed Fish Replenishment
      Areas (FRAs) as well as eight sites where fish collecting is know to occur
      ("impact"), and six managed areas where aquarium fish collection is
      prohibited (three Marine Life Conservation Districts (MLCDs) and three
      FMAs or "control"). Initial surveys confirm that aquarium fish
      collecting impacts are significant but vary along the coastline.
    Purpose: To continue monitoring of these sites as Act 306 is implemented to provide
      an evaluation of the effectiveness of the FRA plan as a way to manage
      aquarium fish collecting impacts in Hawai'i. In addition, examination of
      fish recruitment patterns will provide important information useful to the
      future establishment of MPAs in Hawai'i.
      
      Accordingly, the objectives of this project are to:
      1.Continue to estimate the impacts of aquarium fish collecting at a wide
      range of sites.
      2.Evaluate the effectiveness of the FRA plan by comparing fish abundances
      among control, impact and FRA study sites as Act 306 is implemented in 1999.
      3.Provide baseline information on natural variability in fish and coral
      abundance.
      4.Document recruitment patterns of several aquarium fish species in order
      to examine the population-level outcomes of a marine reserve system.
      5.Disseminate the results of these studies to coral reef ecosystem managers,
      the scientific community, and the public.

      Process_Description: I. Fish Monitoring
        See ../meta/misc/fish_monitor_design.htm or .txt
        
        A. Sampling Design
        objective: to accurately and efficiently monitor spatial and temporal variation
        in fish abundance. The sampling design is focused primarily on detecting change
        in abundant to moderately abundant reef fish across all 24 study sites sampled on
        a bimonthly basis. The simple, low-replicate design minimizes site survey time
        while maximizing repeated surveying of sites to obtain estimates of temporal
        variation in adult and juvenile abundance.
        
        Design of transect layout used at permanent transects. Two 60 m neutral
        gray transect lines are positioned along six permanent stainless-steel eyebolts.
        Divers survey four 25 m transects separated by 10 m buffer areas between replicates.
        
        B. Survey Protocol
        
        Transects are located by differential GPS. Fish densities of all observed species are
        estimated by visual strip transect search along each permanent transect line. Two pairs
        of divers survey the lines, each pair searching two of the 25 m lines. The search of
        each line consists of two divers, swimming side-by-side on each side of the line,
        surveying a column 2 m wide. On the outward-bound leg, larger planktivores and
        wide-ranging fishes within 4 m of the bottom are recorded. On the return leg, fishes
        closely associated with the bottom, juveniles, and fishes hiding in cracks and
        crevices are recorded. Each site is scheduled to be surveyed bi-monthly, weather
        permitting, for a total of six surveys per year.
        
        II. Substrate Monitoring
        
        In addition to the fishes, our program is monitoring the coral reef and associated
        algae and invertebrates to assess coupled changes between the fishes and their
        habitat. We use video transecting methods to obtain estimates of abundance
        of these parameters. Using a digital Sony DCR-TRV900 we swim the length of the
        transect at a constant distance from the bottom. In the laboratory, individuals
        frames are captured using a Canopus DVRex-M1 and archived for future use. We use
        Dr. Phil Dustan's program PointCount to analyzed the images and derive abundance
        estimates of coral, algae, macro-invertebrates and additional habitat parameters.
        Data are entered and maintained in a state-wide, common-format,
        relational database system.
