     PROCESSING CATEGORIES  -  FOOD IRRADIATION 1 CD-ROM


Because the poor quality of the material on this disc precluded
full text conversion (and access), these Food Irradiation
publications have been assigned to processing categories, based
primarily on whether or not the title alone was adequate for
search and retrieval of images.  For documents needing more than
just a title (i.e., where the title was very generic or broad),
abstracts or summaries from the text were added.  If no abstract
or summary were present, then the NATDP staff added subject
descriptors (taken from the CAB Thesaurus).

Four processing or "access" categories were eventually used,
based on what, if anything, would be added to the regular NATDP 
bibliographic header created for each record in the database. 
The regular header includes the following:

     Publication title
     Chapter (Record) title
     Author/Editor
     Year of publication
     Pagination
     Language
     Report number
     Notes (if appropriate)
  
The four processing categories were as follows:

   1.  RELATIONAL HEADER ONLY.

   2.  RELATIONAL HEADER PLUS SUMMARY/ABSTRACT.

       (In some cases, the Table of Contents was used instead
       of the abstract, because it was better for searching.)

   3.  RELATIONAL HEADER PLUS DESCRIPTOR(S), TAKEN FROM CAB.

   4.  RELATIONAL HEADER FOR WHOLE PUBLICATION; CHAPTER TITLES
       AND AUTHORS INPUT AS PART OF ASCII TEXT FILE.

       (This was done for shorter Category 1 publications which
       were divided into chapters and would normally have been
       scanned as multiple small documents, each a chapter in
       length.  Instead of doing each chapter as a separate
       document, all were done together as one long document, but
       all titles and authors are searchable.)

Later, in preparation for republishing this data, we added major
section headings next to the appropriate image links in all
records longer than 20 pages.
