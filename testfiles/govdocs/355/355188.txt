                   OVERVIEW AND BACKGROUND
                              

    The  U.S.  Geological Survey (USGS) Central Energy  Resources
Team’s  Organic Geochemistry Laboratory (CERTOGL) is  a  research
laboratory  devoted  to  the  investigation  of  the  origin  and
occurrence of fossil fuels. One such study involved the petroleum
potential of the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska (1988).  In
order  to  archive geochemical results of this  study,  the  USGS
developed an Alaskan Organic Geochemical Database (AOGDB) in 1978
to  house  the data generated from USGS laboratories and  various
sub-contracted laboratories.  The accumulated data resided  in  a
flat  text  file entitled “PGS” and was originally maintained  by
Petroleum Information Corporation.  The information herein  is  a
breakout  and creation of tables from the master flat  file  form
into  a relational database format.  No electronic data, such  as
chromatograms,  are  available for  this  data  file.  Additional
information  about  “PGS”  and  Alaska  geochemistry   data   and
interpretation can be obtained in Geology and Exploration of  the
National   Petroleum   Reserve   in   Alaska,   1974-1982,   USGS
Professional Paper 1399 (see the sections by Claypool and  Magoon,
p. 451-481, and Magoon and Claypool, p. 519-549.)

    The  database  management software  originally  used  in  the
creation of the AOGDB is MicroRim Corporation's RBase for DOS,  a
database  package designed for use on IBM XT or AT or  equivalent
computers  with MS-DOS or equivalent disk operating systems.  The
AOGDB  consists  of  Rbase tables, which have  subsequently  been
converted  to  Microsoft Access 97 tables and ASCII tables.  Each
table  consists  of  vertical  columns  and  horizontal  rows  of
information where each row represents one sample and the  columns
within  each row represent specific information about the sample.
There  is  only  one  driving table: HEADER_PGS,  which  contains
generic  sample information and permits a relational  pathway  to
the  data  tables  via the primary key: WMO (derived  from  World
Meteorological Organization and the American Petroleum Institute;
see below.)

    There  can  be  any  number  of data  tables,  one  for  each
analytical  technique that produces data in some numeric  format.
The  USGS  AOGDB  has 19 data tables and one  legend  table  that
attempts  to  correlate tabular information back to the  original
PGS  notations.  Additionally, five other tables exist from which
a  number  of  elements were transferred to  form  parts  of  the
HEADER_PGS table.  The tables below are the breakout products  of
the PGS flat file.

   Please note that throughout the text part of this document
UNDERLINED words are actual table names and BOLD words are table
elements (field/column titles).

   The data tables are structured such that the first four
columns of each data table are identical in structure and provide
a linking "key" to the HEADER_PGS table. Note that the column
entitled RC_* is not present in the HEADER_PGS table but exists
in all the Data tables.  The internal "key" for the AOGDB is the
WMO reference number.
   The WMO number is a concatenation of four basic components:
WSC UNIQ HCST and SEQ and is derived by combining the World
Meteorological Organization’s global quadrant naming convention
with the American Petroleum Institute’s naming convention for
wells.  Please also note that the API number for wells lies
between the second and fifteenth position of the WMO number. The
following explains the formation of the WMO number: (note: these
are not table elements)

   1. WSC (World, State, County).  Text field formed by the World
State County combined codes of the WMO number. Samples collected
within the U.S.A (including Alaska, Hawaii, and its Exclusive
Economic Zones (EEZ)) are identified by the world quadrant number
of “9,” then a two digit state code followed by a three digit
county code. In instances of samples received outside the U.S.A
or the EEZ, the State and county codes become pseudo State and
county codes by substituting two digits of latitude for the State
code and three digits of longitude for the county code. The six
digits in the WSC are the first 6 digits in the WMO number.
   2. UNIQ (unique well number).  The unique part of an API well
number.  In the case of outcrops, the UNIQ value becomes a serial
five-digit number greater than 94999.  The UNIQ part of the WMO
number contains five digits beginning at the 7th position of the
WMO number.
   3. HCST (hole change side track).  Side Track and Hole Change.
The HCST field consists of four digits and begins at the 12th
position of the WMO number.  It is normally “0000.”
   4. SEQ (sequence).  The last four digits of the WMO number.
Provides for multiple (9999) samples from one location.  This
part begins at the 16th position of the WMO number.

   RELATIONAL DATABASE TABLES, STRUCTURES, AND DEFINITIONS


To minimize the database size, many text fields are encoded.
Refer to the section Encoding Schemes on page 30 for more
information.


   Table HEADER_PGS contains information about the sample
including latitude, longitude, location, elevation, depth, other
location information, sample identification, sample type(s),
lithology, formation names and ages, well and outcrop (surface)
samples, and any additional information.  All of these data
elements are contained in the HEADER_PGS table.  In addition, the
table contains other information that may be used in data
retrieval for specialized reports, charts, and maps.  HEADER_PGS
contains information from a number of the original tables in the
original PGS flat file.

               that the lower case “r” originally implied that the
               original sample fraction received into the lab was
               a rock sample.  In this instance, even though a
               gas sample was analyzed, it originated from the
               desorption of a canned core (rock) sample.

               values were reported without the negative (“-“)
               notation.  These values were, in all likelihood,
               improperly keypunched into the system.  This
               observer thinks that in fact, no positive values
               exist in this data set.  No attempt has been made
               here to remedy this oversight.


The Table WHLOIL_13C_65_PGS contains information on the Stable
Carbon Isotopes of Whole Oils.  The last six digits of the table

The table COMMENTS_PGS is a forum for the contracting lab to make
statements regarding the sample condition, analytical technique,

      (d) 95000-99999 assigned by USGS WAPI for non-
          well samples (surface, outcrops, speleological,
          mines, seeps, etc.)(World = 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9)

12-13 Two-digit side track code assigned by API (World = 9)

14-15 Two-digit hole change code assigned by API (World = 9)

16-19 Four-digit sample sequence number assigned by USGS WAPI

Note: digits 2-15 of the USGS WMO number are identical to the
fourteen-digit unique API number for all wells within USA/EEZ
(World = 9). The expanded API/WMO number was developed to assign
unique numbers to specific samples collected worldwide.

WSC   World/State/County or World/Lat/Long part of API (digits
     1-6 of the API number);  compare with API encoding scheme.

           DEFINITIONS OF SOME COMMONLY USED TERMS


ASCII--American Standard Code for Information Interchange;
     usually refers to the characters, numbers, and punctuation
     marks found on a typewriter or computer keyboard.

CHROMATOGRAPHY--A method of separating complex mixtures into
      individual chemical compounds or classes of chemical
      compounds by differences in their chemical behavior.

EXTRACTION--The process of dissolution of particular chemical
      compounds from a solid matrix (that is, rock) into a liquid
      solution (that is, bitumen or rock extract).

FRACTION--A group of chemical compounds with similar chemical and
      physical properties (i.e., saturated hydrocarbons, aromatic
      hydrocarbons, resins, asphaltenes, kerogen).

GLOBAL--Applicable to all users.

LOCAL --Applicable to a small group of users (not global).

PYROLYSIS--The heating of a sample in the absence of air;
      followed by subsequent analysis of the products obtained in
      order to determine quantities of products and/or reaction
      kinetic factors. Hydrous pyrolysis is done in the presence
      of an overabundance of water; anhydrous pyrolysis is done on
      the dry sample.

ROCK-EVAL--A rapid anhydrous pyrolysis technique used to semi-
      quantitatively determine the type and quantity of petroleum
      that could be generated from an oil or gas source rock. A
      less rapid Rock-Eval technique can also determine kinetic
      factors.


VITRINITE--A maceral derived from wood or coaly material that
      exhibits higher optical reflectivity with increasing
      exposure to higher temperatures; a thermal maturity
      indicator.
