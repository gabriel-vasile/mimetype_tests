                                      Audio Services Division



                               FM Engineering Data Base Release Tape



            The FM Engineering Data Base is an unofficial secondary source.  It is

            designed solely for use by FCC Engineers as an aid for processing

            applications, petitions for rulemaking, and notifications.  The various

            data elements are the minimum deemed necessary for the stated purpose.  Its

            usefulness to any other group or for any other purpose is coincidental.

            See Section 0.434 of the FCC Rules for a further warning and disclaimer.



            This description applies to the format in which the FCC's FM Engineering

            Data Base is stored on magnetic tape when it is made available outside of

            the FCC.  In the FCC's VAX computer, the FM Engineering Data Base is stored

            as a relational data base.  However, it is necessary to unload it into

            sequential files to copy it on tape.  This description applies to the tape

            format.



            The tape is recorded pursuant to ANSI X3.27-1978 (FIPS Pub 79) using

            variable length records in 2048-byte blocks.  Although the second, third,

            and fourth files on this tape contain fixed-length records, these files are

            written on the tape as though they contained variable-length records.  The

            first file contains records that are truly variable length.



            The volume identifier in the Volume-Header Label is "FCCFM".



            As this is being written, the characters are from the ASCII character set.

            However, it is possible that, in the future, there may be characters from

            the Latin Alpha 1 character set from ISO Standard 8859; these include

            accented characters, etc., and are an expansion to the ASCII character set.



            The tape contains four files.  The files are:



                 1.  The tape description.  This document is included on the tape so

                     that users who receive the tapes on a periodic basis can compare

                     the first file on each tape with the first file on the previous

                     tape.  If there are no changes, then the format and descriptions

                     have not changed.  However, if there are differences, it is

                     necessary to review the first file on the new tape to determine

                     what changes in format and/or descriptions have been made.  The

                     first file will also contain announcements about possible future

                     changes.



                 2.  The primary FM Engineering Data Base.  This contains the

                     engineering data for all existing and proposed stations, vacant

                     and used allotments, and proposed rulemakings.  Pertinent

                     engineering parameters, such as power, height, frequency, class,

                     and coordinates, are included, as well as identifying information

                                                                            7 June 1995





                     such as call sign, city, state, and owner's name.



                 3.  The comments for the FM Engineering Data Base.  This contains the

                     comments associated with records in the primary FM Engineering

                     Data Base.



                 4.  The directional antenna tabulations for certain FM stations.

                     Initially, this will contain the tabulations only for those

                     directional facilities which have applied pursuant to Section

                     73.215 of the FCC rules.  Ultimately, we intend to have

                     tabulations for all directional FM stations, but this may take

                     years to finish.





            Before describing the second, third, and fourth files on this tape, it is

            important to discuss the concepts used in the data base design.  As

            mentioned above, the FCC stores the FM Engineering Data Base as a

            relational data base.  For a good description of relational data bases, see

            __ ____________ __ ________ _______
            An Introduction to Database Systems, Volume I, Fourth Edition, by

            C. J. Date, Addison-Wesley Publishing Co., 1986.



            The second, third, and fourth files on this tape are each a relation, or

            table, from the relational data base.  Each record has a unique primary

            key.



            The primary key for the second file on this tape (the primary FM

            Engineering Data Base) is a data element called "mainkey".



            The primary key for the third file on this tape (the comments) is the

            concatenation of the data elements "mainkey", "comment type", and "comment

            number".  The comments can be joined to the records in the primary table by

            use of the "mainkey".  FM records without comments do not have any records

            in the comment file.



            The primary key for the fourth file on this tape (the directional antenna

            tabulations) is the concantenation of the data elements "make" and "model".

            The directional antenna tabulations can be joined to the records in the

            primary table by use of the "make" and "model".  Non-directional FM records

            do not have any records in the directional antenna tabulation file.  Also,

            since this is a newly-created file, initially, most directional FM records

            will not have any records in the directional antenna tabulation file.



            The "mainkey" data element is 16 characters long, and is a hexadecimal

            representation of a 64-bit value.



               ___
            Do not assume that the records on this tape are sorted in any particular

            order.  The relations (or tables) in a relational data base are logically

            stored in a random order.



            The remainder of this description covers the data elements in the FM

            Engineering Data Base, the related comments, and the directional antenna

            pattern tabulations.  The description includes the name of the data

            element, its starting position in the record, its length, and a definition

            of the element itself.



            All of the information is stored in character format; floating point

            numbers and integers are not used.  Accordingly, the numbering for the

            beginning of the field and the length of the field is in characters.

            Numeric fields are right justified, and will have leading spaces rather

            than leading zeros to fill the field.



            If you obtained the tape from NTIS, and the tape is bad, contact NTIS.



            If you are having trouble with the tape structure, refer to ANSI standard

                                                          _____ _______
            X3.27-1978, particularly Section 6.2 entitled Block Formats.  Because the

            records are treated as variable length in all four files on the tape,

            Section 6.2.3, entitled Variable-Length Records (D), is especially

            pertinent.

            The coordinate reference system for the latitudes and longitudes given in

            this data base is the North American Datum of 1927 (NAD 27).  The FCC is

            reviewing the steps required to convert to the North American Datum of 1983

            (NAD 83).  The Commission will issue further guidance on the conversion to

            NAD83 as more information becomes available.

                                     Changes to the Data Base



            The primary FM Engineering Data Base has been changed to add one new

            service class.



                  o  "FS" is a full-service FM station auxiliary transmitting antenna.

                     These records are secondary, hence "FS".  They are not protected

                     in any domestic or international study.  They are not notified

                     internationally.



            This change occured on June 9, 1995.

                                          that an agreement with a foreign country is

                                          applicable.  For U.S.  stations, the value is

                                          "C" if it is sufficiently close to Canada,

                                          and "M" if it is sufficiently close to

                                          Mexico.  For Canadian and Mexican stations,

                                          it is "A" if they are sufficiently close to

                                          the U.S.  It will be blank if the station is

                                          not close to a border.



            Border Dist.      138     3   The distance to the nearest point on the

                                          international border, in kilometers.  This

                                          will be blank if the coordinates are not in a

                                          border area.  This is a right-justified

                                          integer.  If the distance is less than 100

                                          km, there will be one or two leading spaces.



            Horizontal ERP    141     4   The horizontally polarized effective radiated

                                          power (ERP) in kilowatts.  This is right

                                          justified and a decimal point may be

                                          specified.  This can be read with a FORTRAN

                                          F4.0 format.



            Horiz. Max ERP    145     4   The maximum horizontally polarized ERP.  This

                                          is used only in the case of beam tilt.  When

                                          there is beam tilt, this field contains the

                                          maximum ERP, at the tilt angle, while the

                                          Horizontal ERP field contains the ERP in the

                                          horizontal plane.  This is right justified

                                          and a decimal point may be specified.  This

                                          can be read with a FORTRAN F4.0 format.

                                          the center of radiation of the horizontally

                                          polarized antenna, in meters.  This is right

                Directional Antenna Tabulations in the FCC FM Engineering Data Base



            The pattern tabulations are stored using the relative field pattern.

            Values are stored every 10 degrees, and there is provision for as many as

            ten special azimuths, where radiations can be stored at azimuths other than

            integer multiples of 10 degrees.



            The data element "rotate" for a station in the primary FM Engineering Data

            Base is used to determine how much to rotate the tabulated pattern to

            achieve the proper orientation of the pattern.



            The effective radiated power for a station is used to adjust the size of

            the tabulated pattern.

            Antenna Make        1     3    A 3-character abbreviation of the name of

                                           the manufacturer of the directional antenna.

                                           "ODD" is used if the antenna is a composite

                                           of antennas from more than one manufacturer.

                                           This corresponds to the "Antenna Make" field

                                           in the primary FM Engineering Data Base.



            Antenna Model       4    14    A 14-character, left-justified model number

                                           for the directional antenna.  Normally, the

                                           model number is the manufacturer's model

                                           number.  If the antenna is custom designed,

                                           the model number will have "ODD" as the

                                           first three characters.  This corresponds to

                                           the "Antenna Model" field in the primary FM

                                           Engineering Data Base.
