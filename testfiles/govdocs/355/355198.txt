                INFORMATION ON ACCESSING STRONG MOTION DATA
        -------------------------------------------------------------

Earthquake strong motion data are useful for a wide array of seismological
and engineering research and applications. Unfortunately, strong motion data
has never been easy to acquire. Data are available from a diverse array of
organizations and services, and knowing where to look in order to retrieve a
particular set of records is, to put it nicely, complicated. This brief
summary is intended to provide information on obtaining strong motion
records online (or in other digital form), contacting data sources,
retrieving ground motion parameters, and accessing products and information
pertaining to strong ground motions.

The advent of the internet has certainly made remote collection of strong
motion data easier; what has not changed is the fact that many organizations
collect strong motion data, and few have direct approaches for providing the
data to other users. Although I am not directly associated with any data
source, I presently receive at least 5 requests per month for strong motion
data, simply because I have gone through the trouble of assembling
collections for individual earthquakes for my own studies. As you can see,
it is to my benefit to provide the information below, and hence, I created
this web page on the subject.

Since space is limited, a more extensive version of this summary can be
found online at http://www-socal.wr.usgs.gov/wald/smdata.html. While the
purpose of this column is to provide information on online resources, for
completeness sake, I include other means for acquiring data and information
since it seems to be lacking elsewhere. Accessing weak motion data is not
addressed here and I apologize in advance for any omissions or inaccuracies.
Please address corrections or updates to me directly (wald@usgs.gov).

I classify strong motion (internet) resources into three categories:

       DATABASES           DATA SOURCES AND/OR          PRODUCTS AND
                                ARCHIVES                INFORMATION
    (true relational   (data collection agencies,   (ground motion maps,
       databases)        or archived single- and     slip models, etc.)
                        multi-agency collections)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                 DATABASES
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are only a few relational databases for obtaining strong motion time
histories and parameters. Below I give a brief synopsis of each along with a
few caveats.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC)
Strong Motion Data Base (SMDB)
Institute for Crustal Studies, University of California

     The SCEC Strong motion database (SMDB) at U. C. Santa Barbara is a true
     relational database, and provides access to both parametric and
     time-series data for earthquakes in southern California (1933-present).
     The SMDB now has both an X GUI and WWW interface. Time series and
     station maps can be viewed remotely and can be downloaded in SAC or
     ASCII format with the X version or in ASCII format with the WWW
     version. The WWW interface is in the final stages of development.

     The database allows parametric relations, with event, station,
     accelerogram (and parameters), and information objects interconnected,
     so peak values, station information, etc., can be easily searched and
     the results downloaded. Data sources include CDMG, USGS, USC, and SCEC.

     Also available on-line at the SMDB (
     ftp://sadovsky.crustal.ucsb.edu/sm_data) are downloadable files from
     the NOAA CD-ROMS mentioned above.

     Caveats: Data primarily only for southern California earthqakes. Does
     not include SCE, TERRASCOPE, LADWP data for important earthquakes
     (Landers and Northridge, for example). Trigger times are not preserved
     in SAC formated files.

     Both parametric and waveform data can be accessed and downloaded
     on-line using strongmo, an interactive menu-driven program, via the
     internet or in dial-up mode. The database contains primarily free-field
     U.S. and world strong motion records (up to 1994, pre-Northridge) from
     the joint L-DEO/NCEER/USGS strong motion digital network as well as
     USGS, CDMG, and archives from the National Geophysical Data Center
     (NGDC) and a host of other groups. Data from the L-DEO/NCEER/USGS
     network is available from 1988-1994, and on-line data sets include
     Alaskan earthquake since 1960, and a number of eastern U.S. earthquakes
     in the 1970's and 1980's.

     To use strongmo it is necessary to obtain NCEER Report 90-0024, A
     User's Guide to Strongmo: Version 1.0 of NCEER's Strong Motion Data
     Access Tool for PCs and Terminals. It can be obtained either on-line

     Caveats: Terminal and dial-up interfaces; the World Wide Web interface
     is currently under developement.

     The database is part of the European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre
     (EMSC). In 1996, the CGDS developed client/server model of the SMDB
     with new World Wide Web interface and in 1997, scanned photo-images of
     the historical strong motions records were included in the SMDB. Strong
     motion recordings of important earthquakes in Asia including the Gazli,
     Spitak, Tanshang earthquakes are among the collection.

     The SMDB includes parametric information on time histories in the
     database (seismic events, stations, recording instruments, and
     waveforms), digital waveforms, and scanned photo-images (bitmap files)
     of the historical strong motion records.

     Caveats: I could not view the scanned images of records on the WWW.

                       DATA SOURCES AND/OR ARCHIVES
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this section I list organizations which collect data and/or archive their
own data (and/or others). Records can be obtained directly via on-line
systems, as well as in a variety of formats, including magnetic tapes,
floppy disks, CD-ROM, or hard copy. The format of the archives is likely to
be a simple table with events listed by dates, followed by station lists.
The NGDC CD-ROM collection does have a database to determine availability of
records, more or less an inventory, but does not allow access to the data at
the same time, so I do not categorize it under "DATABASES".

     and focal mechanism following earthquakes in southern California.

          http://www-socal.wr.usgs.gov/pga.html

          USGS, CDMG, and CALTECH ground motion parameters are used to
          generate a rapid (about 3-5 minutes after the event) map and the
          first motion focal mechanism for significant earthquakes in
          southern California (M>4.0). Maps of peak ground ground velocity
          and peak ground acceleration are shown atop high resolution
          topography and the freeway system for geographic reference. The
          maps are image maps: selecting a station brings forth information
          about the station location and peak motion values; selecting the
          epicenter returns the earthquake parameters.
