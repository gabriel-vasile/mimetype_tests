      Geospatial_Data_Presentation_Form: vector digital data
  Description:
    Abstract:
      This dataset is a spatial representation of the Public Land Survey System (PLSS) in Alaska, generated from land survey records. The data represents a seamless spatial portrayal of land parcels, their legal descriptions, corner positioning and markings, and survey measurements. This data is intended for mapping purposes only and is not a substitute or replacement for the legal land survey records or other legal documents.
      Measurement and attribute data are collected from survey records using data entry screens into a relational database. The database design is based upon the FGDC Cadastral Content Data Standard. Corner positions are derived by geodetic calculations using measurement records. Closure and edgematching are applied to produce a seamless dataset. The resultant features do not preserve the original geometry of survey measurements, but the record measurements are reported as attributes. Additional boundary data are derived by spatial capture, protraction and GIS processing. The spatial features are stored and managed within the relational database, with active links to the represented measurement and attribute data.
    Purpose: This dataset was created to provide an accurate, seamless portrayal of the PLSS network, based upon survey records. The dataset is intended for use as a base layer for mapping purposes, and as a framework for the portrayal of land ownership

Data_Quality_Information:
  Logical_Consistency_Report: The id of the land unit is the only non-system generated attribute in the data set. The attribute correlates directly with the tabular data used to construct the land unit polygon.
  Completeness_Report: Data collection is complete as of the date of publication. This metadata describes a snapshot of the data, current as of the date of publication.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        ArcInfo Processing:  The data is exported from the SDMS database via an XML file is parsed and used to create ArcInfo point and line generate files. A line coverage is created from the appropriate generate file and the points added using ArcEdit. Topology is built and the resulting coverage is projected to Alaska Albers.

        If intersections are detected during the build, the source data is examined to determine if errors exist in the coordinate data exported from the SDMS database. Standard processing requires a build rather than clean to create topology.

        Coverages are loaded into an ArcSDE Feature Dataset using the cov2sde utility with the append option.
