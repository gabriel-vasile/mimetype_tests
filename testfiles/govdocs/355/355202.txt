                 PUBLIC BUDGET DATABASE USER'S GUIDE
                Budget of the United States Government
                         for Fiscal Year 1998

This document describes six data files that contain an extract of the
OMB budget database.  These files can be used to reproduce many of the
totals published in the Budget and examine unpublished details below
the levels of aggregation published in the budget.  These data,
however, have some limitation to their scope and usefulness.

The following sections describe the sources and limitations of the
data.  Content, format, and coding of the data files are discussed as
well.

1.  Data sources and limitations

a.  Sources of data

Historical data for completed fiscal years are summarized from the
financial records for the U.S.  Government maintained by the
Department of the Treasury.  The totals are generally consistent with
data published in the Monthly Treasury Statement, by the Financial
Management Service of the Department of the Treasury.  Differences
between the Treasury publications and the Budget arise from a small
number of reporting and classification corrections made subsequent to
the Treasury publications.  In the Analytical Perspectives volume, a
chapter titled "Comparison of actual to estimated totals..." presents
a reconciliation of the Budget and Treasury data for the most recently
completed fiscal year.

In addition, these historical records are adjusted each year to
conform to the agency and account structure of the current budget.
For example, data originally reported in the 1966 budget by the
Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, now appear under the
Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Education,
or the Social Security Administration, as appropriate.  Lastly, the
historical database has been updated for changes in the functional
classification of accounts and the Budget Enforcement Act (BEA)
categories, as well as subsequent corrections of reporting errors by
agencies to the Treasury Department.

Budget estimates for the current fiscal year through fiscal year 2002
are prepared by agencies, based on the definitions and guidance
contained in OMB Circular A-11, "Preparation and Submission of Budget
Estimates."  Budget totals for these years reflect the President's
fiscal policy and economic assumptions, which are extensively
described in the Budget documents.

The data files provide sufficient detail to produce (a) outlay totals
by agency, subfunction, and Budget Enforcement Act category that are
consistent with the totals presented in the 1998 Budget; (b) receipt
totals by source, as shown in various published tables in the budget;
and (c) the deficit (on-budget, off-budget, and unified budget basis).

b.  Fiscal years

The data in these files are for fiscal years.  Prior to 1977, the
fiscal year began on July 1 and ended on June 30.  For example, fiscal
year 1965 began on July 1, 1964 and ended on June 30, 1965.  Beginning
with fiscal year 1977, the fiscal year begins on October 1 and ends on
September 30.  For example, fiscal year 1980 began on October 1, 1979
and ended on September 30, 1980.  Fiscal year 1976 ended on June 30,
1976 and fiscal year 1977 began on October 1, 1977.  The period July
1, 1976 to September 30, 1976 is called the "transition quarter" or
TQ.

c.  Units of measure

Data for budget authority, outlays, offsetting receipts, and
governmental receipts are shown in thousands of dollars.  For 1995 and
subsequent years, the data were collected in millions of dollars and
multiplied by 1,000 to maintain the same scale as exists for earlier
years.

d.  Limitations

These data files do not contain data by object classes, data for
program and financing, character class (other than grants to State and
local governments), personnel summaries, or credit schedules.  These
account-level details are based on the proposed budget only and do not
include current services estimates.

With few exceptions, these data present account-level details that are
consistent with the account structure of the current budget.  For
governmental receipts and offsetting receipts, data prior to 1982 are
aggregates in sufficient details to produce the published tables, but
are not "true" account level details.  For budget authority, no data
are available prior to 1976.  For outlays, data for 1962-1981 tend to
be account level details.  Exceptions include the Legislative Branch
and Department of Defense, which are available only at a bureau-level
in the earlier years.

Users of these data files should be careful to review and understand
the effects that these limitations may have on their analysis of
budget data and trends.  For example, computation of compound annual
growth rates of various receipt accounts in the budget could be
severely affected by the discontinuities in account-level details
prior to 1982.


e.  Further information

Readers who are not already familiar with the Federal budget should
gain a familiarity with the concepts and organization of the budget
before proceeding.  The following documents may be helpful:

Analytical Perspectives, Budget of the United States Government,
Fiscal Year 1998.  This document contains analyses that are designed
to highlight specified program areas or provide other significant
presentations of budget data that place the budget in perspective.  It
includes a discussion of the concepts underlying the organization of
the budget and the presentation of budget data, economic assumptions
underlying the budget estimates, Federal receipts and collections,
including user fees and tax expenditures, Federal spending, the Budget
Enforcement Act, and other topics.  Two particularly useful chapters
are "Budget Systems and Concepts and Glossary", which contains a
discussion of budget concepts, and "Federal programs by agency and
account", which contains a listing of all appropriation and fund
accounts in the budget.

OMB Circular A-11 provides instructions to agencies in preparing
budget submissions, including details for entry into the budget
database.

A Citizen's Guide to the Federal Budget provides a summary of the
major themes in the budget for fiscal year 1998.

In addition, there is extensive literature on the Federal budget that
could be usefully consulted.


2.  Data files and file formats

The account level data is available in spreadsheet format and file
import format.

a.  Spreadsheet format

Virtually all spreadsheet software and many other kinds of software
can read the "wk1" format.  Separate files for receipts, outlays, and
budget authority are available in this format and are described in
detail below.

b.  File import format

This generic format is commonly used by database software, spreadsheet
software, and other software products.  In this format, data fields
are separated by commas, text fields are contained inside double quote
marks, and numerical fields do not have embedded commas.  Each record
is contained on a single line.  These files, which have contents
identical to the spreadsheet format files, are also described below.

c.  File names, contents, and sequence

In all files, the records are sequenced by agency code, bureau code,
account code, subfunction code, BEA category, Grant/Nongrant, and On-
Off-budget field.

The files with the account level data:

OUTLAYS.WK1     Outlays and offsetting receipts, 1962-2002,
                in spreadsheet format.

OUTLAYS.TXT     Outlays and offsetting receipts, 1962-2002,
                in file import format

RECEIPTS.WK1    Governmental receipts, 1962-2002,
                in spreadsheet format

RECEIPTS.TXT    Governmental receipts, 1962-2002,
                in file import format.

BUD_AUTH.WK1    Budget Authority and offsetting receipts, 1976-2002,
                in spreadsheet format.

BUD_AUTH.TXT    Budget Authority and offsetting receipts, 1976-2002,
                in file import format.

Offsetting receipts are in the budget authority files as well as the
outlay files.  These amounts are needed to calculate net budget
authority and net outlays.

d.  Relational database considerations

If you plan to use these data in a relational database, you should
designate the following fields as "primary" to uniquely identify each
row of data:  agency code, bureau code, account code, subfunction
code, BEA category, Grant/Nongrant, and On- Off-budget field.


3.  Categorization of budget data

The categorization of budget data differs slightly among receipts,
outlays, and budget authority files.

a.  Budget authority and outlay files

Account details are categorized using the following keys:

Agency.--Agency codes generally correspond to the Cabinet department
or independent agency with primary responsibility for the program.
There are two major exceptions to this definition:  (1) the
Legislative Branch and the Judiciary are displayed as agencies, though
they are separate branches of Government and (2) intragovernmental
payments of interest to trust funds, payments of employer share of
employee retirement contributions, and interest paid to the Outer
Continental Shelf escrow account are classified as "undistributed
offsetting receipts."  The agency coding used in the data files are
consistent with the tables in the budget documents that present budget
authority and outlays by agency.  These codes and titles differ from
the "Treasury Agency" code, described below.  In addition, some
allowances are not distributed by agency and are given a special
agency code.

Bureau.--Bureaus are major subdivisions within Cabinet departments
that correspond to major organizational areas.  Within Cabinet
departments, these major organizational areas may be called "bureaus"
(e.g., the Bureau of the Census within the Commerce Department or the
Bureau of Labor Statistics within the Labor Department), "services"
(e.g., the Internal Revenue Service, or Secret Service within the
Treasury Department or the Economic Research Service within the
Agriculture Department); "offices" (e.g.  Office of Postsecondary
Education in the Education Department) or they may be broad budget
categories (e.g., Procurement or Military Personnel in the Defense
Department).  Table 1 presents a listing of the agency and bureau
categories used in the data files.

Account.--These numbers are assigned by the Treasury Department and
are used for budget presentation and financial management.  In some
instances, groups of small accounts (usually miscellaneous receipt
accounts or miscellaneous special and trust fund accounts) have been
consolidated into single accounts.

Subfunction.--Accounts are categorized by the subfunctions shown in
Table 2. Accounts that include multiple subfunctions are subdivided
into subfunction components.

Treasury Agency.--These codes are defined in the Treasury Financial
Manual, Supplement to Volume I, Federal Account Symbols and Titles,
which contains the titles corresponding to these codes.

Budget Enforcement Act category.--The Budget Enforcement Act (the
"Act") makes distinctions between mandatory and discretionary accounts
for certain provisions of the Act.  Accounts are categorized
accordingly.  Where an account includes mandatory and discretionary
activities, separate lines of data, appropriately coded, will be found
in the data files.  The possible values this code are:

Discretionary.--Discretionary spending is controlled through annual
appropriations acts.  The Act established spending limits for the sum
of all discretionary spending and established a mechanism for
sequestration of budget authority if these limits were exceeded.  The
accounts, or parts of accounts, identified as "discretionary" comprise
discretionary spending as defined by the Act.

Mandatory.--The Act requires that legislation pertaining to receipts
and mandatory (or direct) spending not increase the deficit.  If
receipts legislation and mandatory spending legislation increase the
deficit, a mechanism for sequestration of non-exempt mandatory
spending takes effect.  The accounts, or parts of accounts, identified
as "mandatory" comprise mandatory spending as defined by the Act.
Governmental receipt accounts are categorized as "governmental
receipts" as described below.

Net Interest.--Interest payments to and from the public and
intragovernmental payments of interest, primarily to trust funds, are
not included as either mandatory or discretionary spending.

Readers wanting more information on this topic may refer to several
chapters in the Analytical Perspectives volume.

Grant/Non-grant.--Grants to state and local governments are separated
from non-grant outlays, based on the definitions in OMB Circular A-11
for data section C.

b.  Receipts files

Receipt account data are categorized as follows:

Source category.--These are major categories of governmental receipts,
such as individual income tax receipts or corporation income tax
receipts.  (See Table 3.)

Source subcategory.--These present further detail within source
categories.  (See Table 3.)

Account.--These are assigned by the Treasury Department and are used
for budget presentation as well as financial management.  In some
instances, groups of small accounts (usually miscellaneous receipt
accounts) have been consolidated into single accounts.

Treasury Agency.--These codes are defined in the Treasury Financial
Manual, Supplement to Volume I, Federal Account Symbols and Titles,
which contains the titles corresponding to these codes.
