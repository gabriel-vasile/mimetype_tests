<abstract>A geospatial interface will be developed using ArcIMS software. The interface will provide a means of accessing information stored in the SOFIA database and the SOFIA data exchange web site through a geospatial query.  The spatial data will be served using the ArcSDE software, which provides a mechanism for storing spatial data in a relational database.  A spatial database will be developed from existing data sets, including national USGS data sets, the Florida Geographic Digital Library, and other available data sets.  Additional data sets will be developed from the published data sets available from PBS and other projects.</abstract>
<purpose>The South Florida restoration effort requires multidisciplinary information relating to present and historical conditions for use in responsible decision-making.  The South Florida Information Access (SOFIA) database is the cornerstone of information management for the South Florida place-based science program.  Currently, the SOFIA web site and database have a minimal geospatial interface which relies on the Geo-Data Explorer (GeoDE) system developed by the USGS Energy Resources Program in Reston.  A geospatial interface using currently available commercial software (ArcIMS) is needed to develop a more easily maintained and user-friendly interface.  Developing an interface that is directly connected to the SOFIA website and database will provide a more stable long term solution to providing a geospatial interface.</purpose>

A geospatial interface is being developed using ArcIMS software.  The interface will provide a means of accessing information stored in the SOFIA database through a geospatial query.  The spatial data will be served using ArcSDE software, which provides a mechanism for storing spatial data in a relational database.  A spatial database will be developed from existing data sets, including national USGS data sets, the Florida Geographic Digital Library, and other available data sets.  Additional data sets are being developed from the published data sets available from PBS and other projects.

FY03 planned work:

1. Complete the design of the geospatial interface and publish to the web. A prototype is planned for release late in FY02 or early in FY03. This invloves completing the coding of ArcIMS site to customize for PBS needs and updating the site based on feedback from customers following the public release of the site.

2. Populate the geospatial library with background data layers from existing data layers.  THis involves loading  existing background datasets into the geospatial libraryand checking that the data sets have appropriate metadata records.

3. Develop data layers representing the location of USGS data collection sites.  This involves the creation of data layers from the SOFIA database of USGS data collection sites by theme and preparation of metadata records

4. Develop data layers representing published USGS products, such as geologic contour maps. Many of these data sets will be used for the Atlas being prepared as part of the SOFIA database project.  This entails creating data layers from published USGS map products and preparation of metadata records.
