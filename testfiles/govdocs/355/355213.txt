	Description:
		Abstract:
			This ArcView shapefile contains a representation of the
			Johnson-107 coal zone net coal thickness. The
			Johnson-107 coal zone is in the South Carbon coalield in
			the Carbon Basin, Wyoming.  This theme is part of the
			National Coal Resource Assessment in the Northern Rocky
			Mountains and Great Plains region, and can be viewed in
			relation to roads, geology, and other relevant themes of this
			area.
		Purpose:
			The Nation's coal resources are being assessed by the
			USGS.  This assessment identifies and characterizes
			the coal beds and coal zones that will provide the
			bulk of the Nation's coal-derived energy during the
			next few decades.  This assessment is different from
			previous USGS assessments because digital files
			and databases are being collected and stored in
			standardized 			formats, and
			being analyzed using a Geographic Information
			System (GIS).

				Contributed stratigraphic data  that were used to calculate
				net coal thickness at each data point location.  This net
				coal thickness was used to generate the net coal
				thickness isopach map.
		Process_Step:
			Process_Description:
				Stratigraphic data were compiled into a relational
				database.  These data were correlated and the coal beds
				in theJohnson-107 coal zone were identified. Stratigraphic
				data for the coal and rock units in the Johnson-107 coal
				zone
				were downloaded from the relational database and run
				through a custom "parting/split" program to calculate net
				coal thickness at each data location.  The data were
				loaded into an EarthVision software program and the net
				coal thickness was gridded using the isopach grid option,
				four multiple data point (number of closest control points
				used for calculating a grid value), and a grid spacing of
				300 x 300 meters.  An isopach map was generated in
				EarthVision and was studied in detail.  In areas where data
				were widely spaced and/or isopach lines were not
				reasonably accurate (based on known geologic factors)
				control points were added to the data set to better reflect
				the character of the coal thickness in those areas.  Net
				coal thickness was regridded, new isopach maps
				constructed with a constant isopach line interval of 2.5 ft,
				and isopach lines were checked a final time for accuracy.
				The isopach map was then saved to a file in ASCII format.
				The ASCII file was modified using a custom program called
				ismarc.  The newfile was imported into ARC/INFO and
				generated as a polygon coverage using an Arc Macro
				Language (aml). This aml clipped the coverage to the
				study extent and assigned the net coal thickness polygons
				with values that are the average of the values of the
				bounding isopach lines (for example, a polygon defined by
				isopach lines of 2.5 and 5 ft was assigned a net coal
				thickness attribute of 3.75 ft).  A new item was added to
				the polygon attribute table and populated with text labels
				corresponding to the coal thickness categories to be used
				for coal resource tables and graphic display (0-2.5 ft, 2.5-5
				ft, 5-10 ft, 10-20 ft,  20-30 ft, 30-40 ft, 40-50 ft, and 50-100
				ft). The coverage was then dissolved based on the text
				labels. The finalcoverage was projected to geographic
				coordinates and made into a shapefile in  ArcView.
