      Title: Coral Species, Colony Sizes, and Percent Coverage Based on Photoquadrat Images from the Hawaii Coral Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program: 2000 - 2002, (NODC Accession 0002312)
  Description: 
    Abstract: Fixed photoquadrats are used to examine trends of individual organisms with regards to growth,
      recruitment and mortality. Five haphazardly selected photoquadrats at each depth contour were established with 4
      pins at each corner to ensure accurate repositioning of the frame.  NODC Accession 0001115 consists of these
      photoquadrat images from CRAMP surveys taken from 1999 to 2002 at 27 sites within the main Hawaiian Islands.
      Some locations have multiple depths.  Surveys were taken once per year. Field work coincided with video transects.
      
      This data set consists of an MS Access relational database and subsequently derived spreadsheets based on these
      tables.  The data were generated by PointCount99 on the images found in NODC Accession 0001115.  The PointCount
      output (not included) is the raw data while the Access database files (MDB) are summary files as well as select
      raw data.
    Purpose: To understand the ecology of Hawaiian coral reefs in relation to the geographic areas and to monitor
      change at each given site. CRAMP experimental design allows detection of changes that can be attributed to
      various factors such as:overuse (over-fishing, anchor damage, aquarium trade collection, etc.), sedimentation,
      nutrient loading,catastrophic natural events (storm wave impact, lavaflows), coastal construction, urbanization,
      global warming(bleaching), introduced species, algal invasions, and fish and invertebrate diseases. The emphasis of
      the program is on the major problems facing Hawaiian coral reefs as listed by managers and reef scientists during
      workshops and meetings held in Hawaii (1997-1998). These are:over-fishing,sedimentation,eutrophication, and algal
      outbreaks.CRAMP experimental design gives priority to areas where baseline data relevant to these issues were
      previously collected. Transect dimensions, number of replicates, and methods of evaluation have been selected to
      detect changes with statistical confidence. Standard techniques include the establishment of permanent transects
      to quantify fish, coral, algae, and invertebrates at study sites. CRAMP researchers are quantifying changes that
      have occurred on coral reefs subjected to varying degrees of fishing pressure, sedimentation,eutrophication, and
      algal growth and are conducting experimental work in order to test hypotheses concerning the role of these
      environmental factors in the ecology of coral reefs. We are also in the process of resurveying, updating and
      integrating existing ecological information on an array of coral reefs that have been designated as areas of
      concern or, "hot spots," by managers and scientists.
    Supplemental_Information: These sites were surveyed using SCUBA equipment and a digital camera. The project was
      launched by the Coral Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program (CRAMP) at the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology.

    Process_Step: 
      Process_Description: Fixed photoquadrats allow examination of trends of individual organisms with regards to growth,
        recruitment and mortality. Five haphazardly selected photoquadrats at each depth contour were established with
        4 pins at each corner to ensure accurate repositioning of the frame. The frame dimension samples 0.33 m2of the
        substrate at a height of 0.5m from the bottom.  Surveys are made annually at the time of video transects.
        
        PointCount99
        
        PointCount99 is a Win95/98 based PC program derived from  PointCount
        for Coral Reefs which was developed in support of the United States
        Environmental Protection Agency's Florida Keys Coral Reef Monitoring
        Project (US EPA CRMP).  The software utilizes the random point count
        method for accurately estimating percent coverage of corals, sponges, and
        associated substrate from digitally frame-grabbed underwater video images.
        Unlike its predecessor, PointCount for Coral Reefs, which operated in
        conjunction with Media Cybernetics Image-Pro Plus graphics software,
        PointCount99 is a stand-alone Visual Basic program built on Accusofts
        Image Gear platform.  Funding for the development of PointCount99 was
        provided by the Jeanette and Lafayette Montgomery Foundation.
        
        PointCount99 makes image identification an efficient process. It calls up an
        image file and overlays a unique set of points supplied by an internal random
        number generator. PointCount99 is also able to use a unique set of random
        points (cd.dat) created for, and stored along with, a set of images. The user
        identifies each point and enters the data via a mouse driven graphic user
        interface. Species and substrate identifications require only a single mouse
        click. Corrections and multiple selections are easy to make, and hot keys are
        available to expedite the process. PointCount?99 also makes identifications
        easier by allowing the user to zoom in and out on images and enhance image
        quality with buttons for brightness/contrast, sharpness, and color levels.
