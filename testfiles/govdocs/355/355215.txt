	Description:
		Abstract:
			This theme is a digital point coverage showing the location
			of non-confidential drill hole data used in the assessment of
			total coal resources in the Anderson-Canyon coal zone,
			Decker coalfield, Powder River Basin, Montana. This
			theme was created specifically for the National Coal
			Resources Assessment in the Northern Rocky Mountains
			and Great Plains Region.
		Purpose:
			The Nation's coal resources are being assessed by the
			USGS.  This assessment identifies and characterizes
			the coal beds and coal zones that will provide the
			bulk of the Nation's coal-derived energy during the
			next few decades.  This assessment is different from
			previous USGS assessments because digital files
			and databases are being stored in standardized formats,
			and being analyzed using a Geographic Information
			System
			(GIS).
		Supplemental_Information:
			This theme represents a digital point coverage showing the
			location of 263 non-confidential drill holes used in the
			assessment of total coal resources of the
			Anderson-Canyon coal zone in the Decker coal field,
			Montana.
			Most of the drill hole data used in the Decker
			coal field study was previously compiled in the U.S.
			Geological Survey National Coal Resources Data System
			(NCRDS), although some additional drill hole data not
			present in NCRDS was also incorporated into this study.
			These data were collated in a commercial relational
			database (Stratifact; GRG Corporation).  Subsequently, a
			process of point data verification and editing was initiated.
			These data were cross-checked with published or
			unpublished drill hole records (when available) that
			included information on drill hole location and surface
			elevation with accompanying geophysical logs, cuttings
			descriptions and/or core logs from which coal thickness
			and depth could be determined.  In the case of cuttings or
			core descriptions, coal thickness and depth were taken
			directly from the written reports.  When geophysical logs
			were used, however, coal thickness and depth were
			measured from original analog prints or copies of the
			geophysical logs. Types of geophysical logs typically
			used for coal measurements include natural-gamma
			(gamma ray), gamma-gamma density (bulk density) and
			resistivity (or resistance) logs.  Caliper logs, which measure
			variations in the drill hole diameter, were used in
			conjunction with density logs to verify that low density log
			deflections were in response to coal rather than drill hole
			washout. When no additional records other than those
			reported in NCRDS for a specific drill hole could be
			located, we compared the NCRDS information with data
			from wells nearby to determine the validity and usefulness
			of those data.
			Once the point data were collated and edited for
			stratigraphic and coal geologic content, the point data set
			was imported into ARCVIEW and converted to a shapefile
			for incorporation as a theme in the ARCVIEW project. Only
			public (non-confidential) data points in the Decker coal
			field (Montana) are included in this coverage.
			The point data theme is linked to a table that
			includes a USGS point identification number (internal
			designation); the source of the drill hole information
			(company or agency) and the published or alternative drill
			hole identification number; the surface elevation (in feet) of
			the drill hole; the total depth (in feet) of the drill hole; drill
			hole location reported by  section, township and range; the
			total, net coal thickness (in feet) for all coal beds in the
			Anderson-Canyon coal zone in each drill hole; the number
			of beds within the coal zone; the 7.5' quadrangle in which
			the well was drilled; the well type (coal exploratory or oil
			and gas test); and the drill hole location in coordinates of
			latitude and longitude.  In all cases, drill hole locations (x,y)
			in coordinates of latitude and longitude came directly from
			the National Coal Resources Data System (NCRDS), and
			thus, the accuracy of the well locations cannot be fully
			verified in all cases.
			Common abbreviations used in the sources of drill hole
			information include USGS for the U.S. Geological
			Survey; MBMG for the Montana Bureau of Mines and
			Geology; Bur of Rec or USBR for the U.S. Bureau of
			Reclamation; BLM for the Bureau of Land Management;
			and MMS for the Minerals Management Service.  In the
			case of oil and gas wells, the total depth as reported
			actually reflects the depth to which the drill hole record was
			interpreted for coal, rather than the total depth of the well.
