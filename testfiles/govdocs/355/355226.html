<IMG ALT="[Large Retailers' After-Tax Profits.]" IMG ALIGN=middle 
IMG SRC="/pub/csd/qfr/images/qfr962rt.gif"><BR>

After-tax profits for retail corporations with assets of $50 million and 
over averaged 1.7 cents per dollar of sales for the second quarter of 
1996, up 0.4 (+/-0.18) cents from the preceding quarter, but the same as a 
year ago, according to advance data from the Commerce Department&#96;s Bureau 
of the Census.<BR><BR>

For the second quarter of 1996, these large retail corporations reported 
after-tax profits of $3.9 billion, up $1.0 (+/-0.2) billion from the 
preceding quarter, and up $0.2 (+/-0.2) billion from the same quarter a 
year ago.  The annual rate of after-tax return on stockholders&#96; equity was 
10.0 percent, compared to 7.5 percent in the first quarter of 1996, and 
10.1 percent in the second quarter of 1995.<BR><BR>

Second quarter 1996 sales were $233.3 billion, up $7.9 billion or 3.5 
(+/-1.8) percent from last quarter.  First quarter sales compared to the 
same quarter a year ago were up $14.8 billion or 6.8 (+/-2.0) percent.<BR><BR>

These data are based on quarterly financial reports obtained from 546 
corporations.  The figures in this release are not seasonally adjusted.  
More detailed information on the retail trade sector for the second quarter 
will be published in the Quarterly Financial Report for Manufacturing, 
Mining, and Trade Corporations--Third Quarter 1996 which is scheduled 
for release on December 16, 1996.<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1><B>EXPLANATORY NOTES:</B><BR><BR>

This quarter&#96;s publication contains data revised due to the 
reclassification of corporations by industry, and revisions that reflect 
respondents&#96; corrections of submitted data subsequent to original 
publication.<BR><BR>

A statement such as &quot;up 2.5 (+/-0.15) cents,&quot; appearing in the text, 
indicates the range (+2.35 to +2.65 cents) in which the actual change is 
likely to have occurred.  The range given for the change is a 90 percent 
confidence interval that accounts only for sampling variability.  If the 
range had contained zero (0), it would have been uncertain whether there
was an increase or decrease; that is, the change would not have been 
statistically significant.  For any comparison cited without a confidence 
interval, the change is statistically significant.  The quarterly 
publication includes more detailed explanations of confidence intervals 
and sampling variability, along with additional measures of sampling 
variability.</FONT><BR><BR>
