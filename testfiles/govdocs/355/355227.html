<h2>Program Data</h2>

<h3>Social Security</h3>

<p>The Social Security program&mdash;Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance&nbsp;(<abbr class="spell">OASDI</abbr>)&mdash;provides monthly benefits to workers and their families when the worker retires, dies, or becomes disabled. The amount of the worker's retirement insurance (old-age) or disability benefit is based on the worker's level of earnings in employment or self-employment covered by the Social Security program. Monthly benefits are payable to retired workers at age&nbsp;62 (with reduced benefits) or to disabled workers at any age. The benefit amount for an auxiliary or survivor beneficiary is based on a percentage of the worker's benefit. Auxiliary and survivor beneficiaries must generally meet an age, disability, or child care requirement.</p>
