      <p align="center"><strong>EPA Releases National Inventory of Contaminated 
        Sediments</strong></p>
      <p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) first national report 
        on sediment quality in the nation's rivers and other inland and coastal 
        waterways finds every state has some sediment contamination--accumulation 
        of toxic chemicals sufficient to pose potential risks to people who eat 
        fish, and to fish and wildlife themselves. Sites with the highest measured 
        levels of sediment contamination tend to cluster around larger urban areas 
        and industrial centers, and in regions affected by agricultural and urban 
        runoff. Streams, lakes, and harbors can be affected.</p>
      <p><strong>Report Released in January</strong></p>
      <p>EPA released its report, <em>The Incidence and Severity of Sediment Contamination 
        in Surface Waters of the United States,</em> on January 7, 1998. It is 
        the Agency's first comprehensive analysis of existing sediment chemistry 
        and related biological data to assess the national incidence and severity 
        of sediment contamination.</p>
      <p>The three-volume report describes areas where chemical contaminants are 
        present in river, lake, ocean, and estuary sediments and includes an assessment 
        of the potential for associated adverse effects on people and aquatic 
        life: </p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Volume 1: National Sediment Quality Survey</em> (EPA 823-R-97-006) 
          assesses the probability of associated adverse human or ecological effects 
          with contaminated sediment based on a weight-of-evidence evaluation.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Volume 2: Data Summaries for Watersheds Containing Areas of Probable 
          Concern (APCs)</em> (EPA 823- R-97-007) presents sampling station location 
          maps and chemical and biological summary data for watersheds containing 
          APCs. </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Volume 3: National Sediment Contaminant Point Source Inventory</em> 
          (EPA 823-R-97-008): A screening analysis that identifies probable point 
          source contributors of sediment pollutants. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>In preparing the report, EPA assembled the largest set of sediment chemistry 
        and related biological data ever and compiled the data into a database 
        called the National Sediment Inventory. EPA advocates using a &quot;weight-of-evidence&quot; 
        approach to sediment contamination assessment based on many types of measures.</p>
      <p>The Agency examined approximately 2 million records from more than 21,000 
        sampling stations located in 1,363 of the 2,111 watersheds (65 percent) 
        in the continental United States. The locations were sampled between 1980 
        and 1993. Because the data were collected over a relatively long period 
        of time, the results represent conditions over the past 15 years and are 
        a baseline for future assessments.</p>
      <p><strong>Watershed Classifications</strong></p>
      <p>EPA classified each sampling station in one of three tiers based on data 
        recorded for that location: 26 percent of the sampling stations fell into 
        Tier 1 - adverse effects are probable; 49 percent fell into Tier 2 - adverse 
        effects are possible but expected infrequently; and 25 percent fell into 
        Tier 3 - no indication of adverse effects.</p>
      <p>Adjusting for sampling bias towards known or suspected contamination, 
        and the efficiency of screening-level assessment guidelines to predict 
        adverse effects, EPA estimates that approximately 6 - 12 percent of the 
        sediment underlying the nation's surface water poses a potential environmental 
        threat.</p>
      <p><strong>Areas of Probable Concern</strong></p>
      <p>The Agency identified 96 watersheds (7 percent of those evaluated) that 
        contain &quot;areas of probable concern&quot; (APCs) where potential adverse effects 
        of sediment contamination are likely to be found.</p>
      <p>These watersheds contain 10 or more Tier 1 sampling stations,and at least 
        75 percent of their sampling stations are classified as either Tier 1 
        or Tier 2. As shown in the accompanying map, they are on the Atlantic, 
        Gulf, Great Lakes, and Pacific coasts, as well as in inland waterways, 
        and in regions affected by urban and agricultural runoff, municipal and 
        industrial waste discharges, and other pollution sources.</p>
      <p>Bottom-dwelling creatures may not be able to live in portions of these 
        watersheds. And because contaminants in sediment can move up the food 
        chain, fish that live in these waters may contain chemicals at levels 
        unsafe for regular consumption.</p>
      <p>Some of these areas have been studied extensively, and appropriate management 
        actions are now in place. Other areas, however, may require further evaluation 
        to confirm that environmental effects are occurring. Because EPA relied 
        on readily available electronic data, primarily from national and regional 
        databases, some well-known highly contaminated areas are omitted.</p>
      <p><strong>Concerns Over Fish Consumption</strong></p>
      <p>Anyone fishing contaminated waters for food faces health risks. People 
        who regularly eat fish caught from areas where sediment is contaminated 
        may increase their risk of cancer or other long-term adverse health effects 
        because toxic chemicals can accumulate in the edible portions of fish.</p>
      <p>Most states routinely issue consumption warnings for waters where fish 
        are contaminated. More than two-thirds of the watersheds containing areas 
        of probable concern already have active fish consumption advisories in 
        place. Not all of the APCs are based on potential human health risk, however, 
        many are based solely on potential risks to aquatic life.</p>
      <p>Sediment at many sites throughout the United States was polluted years 
        ago by chemicals such as DDT, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and mercury. 
        While their use has been banned or restricted for many years, these chemicals 
        persist for decades in the sediment, where they continue to be a source 
        of concern for the environment and public health. In the meantime, other 
        chemicals entering surface waters from industrial and municipal discharges 
        and polluted runoff from urban and agricultural areas continue to accumulate 
        to harmful levels in sediments.</p>
      <p><strong>Societal Costs of Contamination</strong></p>
      <p>Ecological and human health impairment due to contaminated sediment imposes 
        costs on society. Diseases that cause tumors and fin rot in fish and and 
        the loss of species and communities that cannot tolerate sediment contamination 
        can severely damage aquatic ecosystems.</p>
      <p>Potential societal costs include lost recreational enjoyment and revenues 
        or, worse, possible long-term health problems such as cancer or children's 
        neurological and IQ impairment if fish consumption warnings are not issued 
        and heeded.</p>
      <p>The health and ecological risks posed by contaminated sediment dredged 
        from harbors can lead to increased cost of disposal and lost opportunities 
        for beneficial uses, such as habitat restoration.</p>
      <p><strong>Future Study Recommendations</strong></p>
      <p>Based on the results of this study, EPA recommends further evaluations 
        of the 96 watersheds containing areas of probable concern that focus on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Collecting and analyzing additional sediment chemistry and related 
          biological data where needed.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Further evaluating the potential for human health and ecological risk.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Determining spatial and temporal trends.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Identifying potential sources of contaminants and determining whether 
          they are adequately controlled.</li>

      <p><strong>Summary of Discussions During the Interactive Short Course on 
        &quot;Use of Sediment Quality Guidelines in the Assessment and Management of 
        Contaminated Sediments&quot;</strong></p>
      <p>A 1-day course held in San Francisco, California, on November 16, 1997, 
        in conjunction with the 18<sup>th</sup> annual SETAC meeting, described 
        approaches to developing sediment quality guidelines (SQGs) and discussed 
        their use in sediment quality assessment and management.</p>
      <p>The course was developed by 24 instructors and attended by 80 individuals 
        representing a broad range in backgrounds and expertise. It consisted 
        of both Plenary and Work Group sessions. The opening plenary session gave 
        participants information on the derivation, strengths, limitations, and 
        uses of numerical SQGs. An integrated framework for assessing sediment 
        quality conditions and several case studies were presented to illustrate 
        the applications of SQGs.</p>
      <p>The Work Group sessions gave course participants an opportunity to discuss 
        several important applications of the SQGs, including dredged material 
        disposal analysis, sediment management, and sediment remediation. During 
        the final plenary session, the main points of the Work Group discussions 
        were presented to the entire group. In addition, through keypad polling 
        and panel discussions, participants expressed their views on the application 
        of SQGs.</p>
      <p><strong>Discussions Summary</strong></p>
      <p>Some important summary points from the course participants' discussions 
        and associated keypad polling sessions included:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Information on background concentrations is important for using SQGs 
          in sediment quality assessments.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>SQGs are useful tools for assessing sediment quality, but all SQGs 
          derived from different approaches have a number of limitations which 
          influence their use in various applications. Therefore, SQGs used in 
          conjunction with other tools (e.g., toxicity tests, benthic community 
          surveys) to obtain a weight-of-evidence can enhance sediment management 
          decisions.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>SQGs provide relevant tools for screening sediment chemistry data; 
          designing monitoring programs; identifying the need for source controls; 
          classifying hot spots,ranking sites; identifying chemicals of potential 
          concern; and establishing candidate sediment quality remediation objectives. 
          However, they cannot be used alone as pass/fail criteria for all applications.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Sediment chemistry, sediment toxicity, benthic invertebrate community 
          structure, and bioavailability data are all relevant for development 
          of sediment quality remediation objectives (i.e., clean-up levels).</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Multiple SQGs can be evaluated and the most appropriate used to develop 
          sediment quality remediation objectives for a particular site.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Effects-based SQGs do not consider the potential for bioaccumulation; 
          therefore, bioaccumulation-based SQGs should be evaluated and used, 
          as applicable, to support the establishment of sediment quality remediation 
          objectives.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>A range of suggestions for improving the SQGs were also provided by 
          short course participants, including addressing the major limitations 
          of the SQGs, identifying cause and effect relationships, calculating 
          toxicity equivalents, addressing the bioavail-ability of contaminants, 
          identifying the substances contributing to the toxicity of mixtures, 
          and increasing their applicability in different sediment types.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Guidance Planned</strong></p>
      <p>The instructors are developing a series of journal articles dealing with 
        guidance on uses of SQGs to assess and manage contaminated sediments. 
        They plan to develop a lead paper describing an overall framework of how 
        SQGs can be used in assessing sediments, followed by a series of papers 
        outlining SQG applications.</p>

      <p align="center"><strong>Clean Water Action Plan Targets Fish Advisories, 
        Contaminated Sediments</strong></p>
      <p>The President's Clean Water Action Plan, released in February, provides 
        a blueprint for restoring and protecting the nation's rivers, lakes, and 
        coastal areas.</p>
      <p>Its centerpiece is a new initiative to integrate efforts to restore and 
        protect the quality of water and related natural resources on a watershed 
        basis. Organizing projects at this level helps achieve clean water goals 
        in more places, more quickly.</p>
      <p>The plan is the core of the President's Clean Water Initiative to fulfill 
        the Clean Water Act's original goal--fishable and swimmable water for 
        every American. It seeks to bolster current clean water programs in public 
        health and other areas.</p>
      <p><strong>Fish and the Action Plan</strong></p>
      <p>Improving assurances that fish and shellfish are safe to eat is one way 
        the plan will increase efforts to protect public health.</p>
      <p>States and tribes issue consumption advisories to protect citizens from 
        eating contaminated fish. In 1996, 2,193 public advisories restricting 
        the consumption of locally caught fish were in effect. Today, 15 percent 
        of the nation's lake acreage and 5 percent of the nation's river miles 
        are under fish consumption advisories, along with all of the Great Lakes 
        and their connecting waters, a large portion of the nation's coastal waters, 
        and about 20 percent of the National Wildlife Refuges.</p>
      <p>Most consumption advisories have involved mercury contamination of fish. 
        Mercury accumulates most efficiently in the aquatic food web. Predators 
        at the top of the aquatic food web generally have higher mercury concentrations.</p>
      <p>To assess the extent of fish contamination, the action plan calls for 
        EPA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to conduct 
        a national survey of mercury and other contaminant levels in fish and 
        shellfish from 1998 to 2000. To maximize its coverage, this effort will 
        be coordinated with state and tribal efforts.</p>
      <p><strong>Contaminated Sediment and the Action Plan</strong></p>
      <p>Besides mercury, fish advisories have been issued for such long-lasting 
        toxic pollutants as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), chlordane, dioxin, 
        and DDT--even though the use of PCBs, chlordane, and DDT was banned or 
        drastically restricted many years ago. Many of these pollutants settle 
        into aquatic sediments, remaining a source of contamination long after 
        the original source is controlled.</p>
      <p>The plan lists three key EPA actions regarding contaminated sediments:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Develop, by 1998, a multimedia strategy addressing mercury and other 
          persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic pollutants that cannot be fully 
          addressed through single medium controls or approaches. The strategy 
          will include enforcement and compliance efforts to address noncompliance 
          associated with contaminated fish and shellfish areas.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Release its Contaminated Sediment Strategy for coordinating program 
          goals to (1) prevent increases in the volume of contaminated sediment, 
          (2) reduce the volume of existing contaminated sediment, (3) ensure 
          that sediment dredging and disposal are managed in an environmentally 
          sound manner consistent with the needs of waterborne commerce, and (4) 
          develop scientifically sound sediment management tools for use in pollution 
          prevention, source control, remediation, and dredged material management.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Begin, in 1998, place-based contaminated sediment recovery demonstration 
          projects in five of the watersheds of greatest concern listed in EPA's 
          National Inventory of Sediment Quality. Remediation efforts will be 
          coordinated with federal resource trustees.</li>

      <p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>
      <p>Even with aggressive efforts to reduce the levels of mercury and other 
        pollutants in fish and sediment that make fish unsafe to eat, many years 
        will be required to stop and then reverse the buildup of these pollutants. 
        Before pollution reduction measures lower pollutants in fish to safe levels, 
        federal, state, and tribal agencies must work together to ensure that 
        the public is accurately informed about contaminated sediments and related 
        health risks of eating fish from specific waters.</p>

        Army Corps of Engineers</strong></p>
      <p>The Inland Testing Manual (ITM) contains up-to-date procedures to implement 
        requirements in the Clean Water Act (CWA) Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines 
        for evaluation of potential contaminant-related impacts associated with 
        the discharge of dredged material in fresh, estuarine, and saline (near-coastal) 
        waters. Formally titled <em>Evaluation of Dredged Material Proposed for 
        Discharge in Waters of the U.S. - Testing Manual,</em> it was prepared 
        by a joint Environmental Protection Agency/U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 
        (EPA/CE) Workgroup.</p>
      <p>In 1991, EPA and CE revised an Ocean Testing Manual (<em>Evaluation of 
        Dredged Material Proposed for Ocean Disposal - Testing Manual</em>) for 
        evaluation of potential contaminant-related impacts associated with the 
        discharge of dredged material in the ocean, under the Marine Protection 
        Research and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA). The ITM is patterned after this 
        manual.</p>
      <p>The ITM Addresses:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>contaminated-related impacts associated with discharges of dredged 
          material resulting from navigational dredging (or dredging activities 
          of essentially the same character as navigation dredging, such as open 
          water discharges of dredged material excavated from a soft-bottom flood 
          control channel or reservoir) in open water disposal areas.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>contaminated-related impacts to waters of the U.S. associated with 
          dredged material runoff from confined disposal areas.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The ITM Does Not Address:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>impacts associated with the dredging activity itself.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>impacts associated with dredged material discharges resulting from 
          excavation of drainage ditches and landclearing.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>impacts associated with the discharge of fill material. However, where 
          dredged material associated with navigational dredging will be discharged 
          in open water as fill, the procedures of this manual are applicable 
          (e.g., the construction of an underwater berm using dredged material).</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
      <p>The ITM provides a national testing framework which comprises one element 
        of an overall decision-making process for determining whether dredged 
        material can be discharged into CWA Section 404 waters. The ITM is intended 
        to provide for consistency between dredged material evaluations under 
        CWA and MPRSA. In recognition of the importance of site- and situation-specific 
        concerns, regional flexibility in implementation and application is allowed 
        within this national framework.</p>
      <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
      <p>The ITM uses a tiered testing approach:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong><em>Tier I</em></strong> - Involves an examination of existing 
          information to determine (1) whether or not there is &quot;reason to believe&quot; 
          that the material needs to be tested for potential adverse effects, 
          and (2) identification of any contaminants of concern relative to testing 
          in later tiers. Material may be excluded from further testing if there 
          is reasonable assurance that (1) it is not a carrier of contaminants, 
          or (2) it is adjacent and similar to the disposal site material, and 
          dispersal of the discharge can be controlled. Some limited testing may 
          be necessary to confirm such exclusions.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><strong><em>Tier II</em></strong> - Is concerned solely with sediment 
          and water chemistry. Tier II provides useful information through screening 
          tools, but not all possible determinations can be reached at this tier. 
          It presently consists of (1) measuring dissolved contaminants, (2) evaluation 
          of state Water Quality Standard (WQS) compliance using a numerical mixing 
          model, and (3) an evaluation of theoretical bioaccumulation potential 
          for nonpolar organic chemicals.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><strong><em>Tier III</em></strong> - Employs well-defined, nationally 
          accepted bioassays including: (1) water column laboratory toxicity tests, 
          (2) whole sediment laboratory toxicity tests, (3) whole sediment bioaccumulation 
          tests. Appropriately sensitive organisms are recommended, including 
          benchmark species for evaluating the sensitivity of regional species. 
          Summaries of test conditions and test acceptability criteria for all 
          recommended bioassay species are also provided. Toxicity testing emphasizes 
          acute responses, generally survival. Water column toxicity evaluations 
          consider mixing of the dredged material at the discharge site. Benthic 
          bioaccumulation testing provides for the determination of bioavailability 
          through 28-day exposure tests. Tier III testing will usually provide 
          sufficient information for use in the overall decision-making process 
          for compliance with the Guidelines.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><strong><em>Tier IV</em></strong> - Will only be used in special cases, 
          where results from tests in earlier tiers are insufficient to determine 
          the potential adverse effects of the material to be discharged. Tier 
          IV, like Tier III, uses toxicity and bioaccumulation tests, however: 
          (1) toxicity tests may involve field (rather than laboratory) exposures, 
          different end-points (e.g., chronic rather than acute), different species, 
          or longer laboratory exposures; (2) bioaccumulation tests may involve 
          field (rather than laboratory) exposures using transplanted or resident 
          organisms, or longer laboratory exposures. Tier IV can also include 
          benthos studies.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
      <p>The ITM is intended to provide greater national consistency in the (1) 
        testing process, and (2) level of environmental protection, both among 
        regions of the U.S. and between inland and ocean waters.</p>

      <p align="center"><strong>New Data Study Supports Existing Sediment Quality 
        Guidelines Developed Using Co-occurrence Approaches</strong></p>
      <p>Co-occurrence approaches for developing sediment assessment guidelines 
        rely on paired field and laboratory data to relate incidence of observed 
        biological effects to the dry-weight sediment concentration of a specific 
        chemical parameter.</p>
      <p>Long et al. (1995) and MacDonald et al. (1996) have generated marine 
        sediment quality guidelines using similar co-occurrence approaches. For 
        each chemical parameter, both approaches identify an upper threshold above 
        which adverse biological effects frequently occur, and a lower threshold 
        below which adverse biological effects rarely occur. Despite some differences 
        in methodology and data used, the thresholds derived from each approach 
        are generally in good agreement with one another.</p>
      <p>Comparison of independently derived sediment quality guidelines to existing 
        co-occurrence values, using the same methodology, can help determine how 
        applicable a particular co-occurrence approach is to other data sets and 
        to other measures of effects. Numerous sediment quality assessment surveys 
        using the sea urchin (<em>Arbacia punctulata</em>) fertilization and embryological 
        development tests have been conducted along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts 
        of the United States. The sea urchin test is performed using porewater 
        from sampled sediment. These data were used to generate co-occurrence 
        sediment quality guidelines using the Long et al. and MacDonald et al. 
        methods for four metals and for PAHs.</p>
      <p>In general, there was excellent agreement between the porewater-based 
        values and the existing sediment quality guidelines. The lower threshold 
        values tended to correspond more closely than the upper threshold comparisons, 
        which were generally within a factor of 2 and usually lower than the comparable 
        Long et al. and MacDonald et al. values. The close correspondence among 
        comparable values for these two distinctly different data sets demonstrates 
        the general applicability of sediment quality guidelines based on the 
        co-occurrence approach, and the comparability of the sea urchin porewater 
        test to other adverse biological effect measures.</p>
