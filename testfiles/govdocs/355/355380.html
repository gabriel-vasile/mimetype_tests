          <h3>Pre-1776 Mentality </h3>
          <p><strong>By U.S. Senator Russ Feingold</strong></p>   </center>
          
        <p>As posted on Daily Kos<br>
          February 2, 2006</p>
          <p>I've seen some strange things in my life, but I cannot describe the 
            feeling I had, sitting on the House floor during Tuesday's State of 
            the Union speech, listening to the President assert that his executive 
            power is, basically, absolute, and watching several members of Congress 
            stand up and cheer him on. It was surreal and disrespectful to our 
            system of government and to the oath that as elected officials we 
            have all sworn to uphold. Cheering? Clapping? Applause? All for violating 
            the law?</p>
          <p>The President and his administration continue their spin and media 
            blitz in attempts to defend the fact that they broke, and continue 
            to break, the law. Their weak and shifting justifications for doing 
            so continue. The latest from the President seems to be that basically 
            the FISA law, passed in 1978, is out of date. His decision that he 
            can apparently disregard &quot;old law&quot; fits the pattern with 
            the President and his administration. He's decided to disregard a 
            statute (FISA) and the Constitution (the 4th Amendment) by continuing 
            to wiretap Americans' phone calls and emails without the required 
            warrant, while at the same time claiming powers of the presidency 
            that do not exist. (Perhaps he feels the Constitution is too &quot;old,&quot; 
            as well.) This administration reacts to any questions about spying 
            on American citizens by saying that those of us who stand up for our 
            rights and freedoms are somehow living in a &quot;pre-September 11th, 
            2001 world.&quot; </p>
          <p>In fact, the President is living in a pre-1776 world. </p>
          <p>Our Founders lived in dangerous times, and they risked everything 
            for freedom. Patrick Henry said, &quot;Give me liberty or give me 
            death.&quot; The President's pre-1776 mentality is hurting America 
            and fracturing the foundation on which our country has stood for 230 
            years. The President can't just bypass two branches of government, 
            and obey only those laws he wants to obey. Deciding unilaterally which 
            of our freedoms still apply in the fight against terrorism is unacceptable 
            and needs to be stopped immediately. </p>
          <p>Many of you saw this week's story in the Washington Post on the exchange 
            Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and I had during his confirmation 
            hearing in January of last year. Mr. Gonzales misled me and the Senate 
            Judiciary Committee under oath about whether the President could spy 
            on Americans without a warrant. (Many of you blogged about it when 
            the story first broke and I thank you for getting the word out.) That 
            exchange is extremely telling about the depths to which this administration 
            will go to grab power. I look forward to a little more honesty from 
            the Attorney General when he testifies about the spying program before 
            the Judiciary Committee on Monday. </p>
          <p>I don't have to tell you how important this issue is. It gets to 
            the core of what we as a country are all about. We all agree that 
            we must defeat the terrorists who threaten the safety and security 
            of our families and loved ones. Why does this President feel we must 
            sacrifice our freedoms to fight terrorism? This is a gut check moment 
            for members of Congress. Do we sacrifice our liberty? Do we bow to 
            those who try to use security issues for political gain? Do we stand 
            and applaud when the President places himself above the law? Or, do 
            we say enough? </p>
          <p>Stop the power grab, stop the politics, stop breaking the law.</p>
          <p>It's time to stand up - not to cheer, but to fight back. <br>
