years learning to mistrust Russians. But for the 19 second graders in Janet
Sanchez's Petroglyph Elementary School classroom, Russians aren't reason
to &quot;duck and cover.&quot; They're pen pals, friends, summer camp companions,
perhaps. They're a good reason to check your classroom's e-mail.</P>

aloud a letter sent by a pen pal at School 121 in Snezhinsk, Russia, where
Chelyabinsk-70 is located. The letter was part of a goodwill package put
together by students in a Russian classroom and transported to Albuquerque
by John Taylor (5336). Twelve New Mexico teachers and several Sandians are

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>This school year 12 New Mexico teachers and their students are exchanging
e-mails, goodwill packages, and the occasional video conference greeting
with school children in Snezhinsk, Russia. Located in the southern Urals
800 miles southeast of Moscow, Snezhinsk is one of the Soviet Union's formerly
secret &quot;closed&quot; cities, home of the nuclear weapons design lab
known as Chelyabinsk-70.</P>

<P>Sandia is coordinating the program, largely through the volunteer efforts
of employees who travel regularly to and from Snezhinsk to work with Chelyabinsk
scientists. They provide technical support and often carry packages of small
gifts ranging from scrapbooks and video tapes to coins and candy.</P>

<P>The New Mexico participants include kindergarten-aged students at The
Learning Circle; elementary school students at Zuni, Georgia O'Keeffe, Petroglyph,
and Valencia; middle school students at Desert Ridge; and high school students
at Sandia High and the Career Enrichment Center.</P>

<P>&quot;How can we go back to wanting to shoot at each other when our kids
are getting to know each other like this?&quot; says Patricia Newman (5337),
who coordinates the School-to-School Program.</P>

<H4>Technologies making world smaller</H4>

<P>The Russians are particularly eager to get to know their American counterparts
because former Soviet policies prohibited foreign interactions by residents
of its secret cities. &quot;It's an elite, closed culture,&quot; she says.
&quot;These kids wouldn't have had these opportunities during the Cold War.&quot;</P>

<P>Sanchez's students correspond every few weeks with students in Nina Morozova's
and Anastasia Maslova's classes at Snezhinsk School 121, exchanging e-mail
greetings and sending by special courier drawings and stories depicting
their classrooms, classmates, homes, and families.</P>

<P>A few of the participating classes are taking advantage of video conferencing
equipment available at Sandia's Cooperative Monitoring Center and at Chelyabinsk-70
that have allowed some very personal exchanges, via satellite, between classrooms
more than 9,000 miles apart. The three video conferences so far have been
marked by amiable, sometimes lively exchanges, Patricia says. In one session,
Russian children sang Russian songs and taught their American counterparts
to sing along. In another, teachers got to know each other exchanging jokes
and intercontinental shop talk.</P>

<P>The students converse in English, as many schools in Snezhinsk begin
teaching English language skills at very early ages.</P>

<P>&quot;The world is becoming smaller and smaller, and it's important we
talk to each other,&quot; Sanchez says. &quot;These are relationships the
kids can take with them throughout their lifetimes.&quot;</P>

<P>The telecommunications equipment being used to conduct the video conferences
was installed at Chelyabinsk-70 last year as part of DOE's Initiatives for
Proliferation Prevention (IPP), an ongoing program under which researchers
at DOE labs work with former Russian weapons scientists to develop nonmilitary
technologies with possible commercial value.</P>

<P>IPP's goals include providing meaningful work for highly skilled Russian
scientists, removing the temptation for some Russian scientists to seek
weapons-related work outside Russia, and spurring Russian and US economic
development. In one IPP-sponsored project, Russian scientists are working
with a US company to develop an improved prosthetic foot using better materials
and a more comfortable design.</P>

<P>Patricia got the idea for the School-to-School Program following a visit
to Sandia last year by Chelyabinsk-70's director of human resources to discuss
educational partnerships. Later that year Patricia, who speaks Russian,
visited Chelyabinsk and met with a friend, Irina Shubina, an interpreter
in Snezhinsk. The two and Snezhinsk teacher Tatiana Rogozhina began recruiting
teachers in their areas to participate in the program. The first e-mail
exchanges began in September, with students and teachers getting more outgoing
as the school year progressed.</P>

<P>&quot;I don't think the children understand the historical significance
of what they're doing,&quot; says Lynn Taylor, a fourth grade teacher at
Valencia Elementary, &quot;but they certainly do understand that this is
a first-time thing.&quot; She says she will encourage the students to correspond
over the summer and hopes their fifth grade teacher will continue the project.</P>

<P>The program has been so successful at building relationships that the
possibility of a Snezhinsk summer camp is being discussed. Although most
of the Russian children don't have the means to travel to the United States,
parents of some of the participating Albuquerque students are considering
sending their children to Snezhinsk for a few weeks this summer.<BR>
