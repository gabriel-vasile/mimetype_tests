  <p align="center" class="forImmediateRelease">July 26, 2002</p>
      <P>
Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have been reading the popular press, as have most of us. As we watched the gyrations that occur in the stock market at the moment, I have been interested at the way people in the press have been portraying what has been happening.     <P>
We have been told in the last few weeks that the market went down because President Bush's speech was not tough enough when he spoke to Wall Street. We have been told that the market went up because Chairman Greenspan's presentation to the Banking Committee was encouraging. We have been told that the market went down because the Banking Committee's bill on corporate governance was too tough and was frightening people.     <P>
Then we were told that the market went up dramatically because the same bill was passed and people were reassured.     <P>
The consequence of all of this is to demonstrate to me that the popular press does not have a clue as to why the market does what it does. They do not understand market forces, and they are looking for reasons with little or nothing to do with what happens in the market.     <P>
I will make a few comments about the market and what it is we might really do in Congress if we want to have an impact on the market and the economy.     <P>
In the short-term, there are two factors that we know about investors in the stock market. No. 1, they hate uncertainty. They hate a situation where they do not know what is going on. This is one of the reasons why they reacted to the recent scandals with respect to accounting: They did not have the certainty that they could depend on the numbers.     <P>
Now, as they are beginning to sort through some of the information we have, they are beginning to feel a slight increase in certainty in their reaction to the numbers. That is showing up in some of the stabilization in the market. It has nothing to do with what kind of a speech the President gives or how eloquent we are in the Senate.     <P>
No. 2, the market has a herd mentality in the short-term. If everyone is selling, we ought to sell. That is the reaction in many brokerage houses. There are those who say: We are contrarians; if everyone is selling, we are going to buy; we are out of the herd mentality. But they are in a herd mentality among the contrarians.     <P>
So there is no careful analysis of what is going on but a flight from uncertainty and a herd mentality, both of which rule the market in the short-term.     <P>
In the long term, however, which is what really matters, there are also two factors in the market we must pay attention to. No. 1, in the long term, the market is self-correcting. Errors of judgment that are made on one side of a trade are compensated for by intelligent decisions on the other side of the trade. One brokerage house or one fund manager who overreacts and makes a serious mistake is offset by another fund manager who serendipitously makes the right decision. Over time, the markets are self-corrected so that the frantic headlines we see in Time Magazine or on the front pages of the New York Times, the market this or the market that, on the basis of the President's speech or the Congress's actions, over time they have no relevance to reality whatever. The market over time is self-correcting, goes in the right direction, and rewards people who do the right thing and punishes people who do the wrong thing.     <P>
Second, over time, the market depends on fundamentals. There are periods of time when we have froth. There are periods that I call ``tulip time''--remembering the tulip mania of the Netherlands. Over time, these periods of froth are squeezed out, and the market makes its decision on fundamentals.     <P>
I say to my friends in the popular press who are trying to sell air time or newspapers: Stop trying to frighten the American people one way or the other. Come back to an understanding that fundamentals in the economy are the things that really matter--not speeches by the President, not actions necessarily by the Congress.     <P>
I think we had to act on the corporate governance area, but we didn't drive the market up or down by the action that we took. We added to the question of fundamentals.     <P>
How well the Sarbanes-Oxley bill works will play itself out in the fundamentals. If it works in a solidly fundamental way, it will benefit the markets. If it turns out it has flaws, it will hurt the market. But the speeches we imagine as we pass the bill have little or no impact.     <P>
One final comment. If we were serious about doing something to change the culture in corporate America, we ought to consider removing taxation on dividends. We have had a lot of conversation about options and managing earnings. If dividends become a reason why people buy stocks, as they once were, that would change the nature of corporate governance fairly fundamentally.     <P>
If a CEO knew his stock price would go up if his dividend were increased and if his investors knew if they get an increase in dividends it would not be eaten up in taxes, there would be a change in the corporate boardrooms of this country that would be salutary.     <P>
I don't have the time to go into this, but at some future time I will explore it. I raised this with Chairman Greenspan when he testified before the Banking Committee and asked him about the propriety of removing taxation from dividends. That was the beginning of a conversation that I want to have over time.     <P>
As we go through the experience of the present economic difficulties and the gyrations of the market, it is time to reflect on fundamental things we can do that will change the nature of the corporate culture. Addressing stock options and expensing stock options is something we can talk about. Dealing with corporate compensation is something we can talk about.     <P>
Back to my earlier point. Over time, the market responds to fundamentals, and, over time, we ought to look at some fundamental changes. That means we have to look at the tax laws. There is nothing that government does that affects corporate activity more than the Tax Code. That is where we ought to look for serious cultural changes.     <P>
I yield the floor. <P>
