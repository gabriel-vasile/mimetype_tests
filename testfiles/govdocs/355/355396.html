<p></p>
<p>After reading the Daily Newsbulletin story &quot;Laboratory under scrutiny 
  at hearing Tuesday in Santa Fe,&quot; I was a little confused. Rep. Debbie Rodella 
  states the Laboratory must, &quot;get rid of that good old boy mentality&quot; 
  while simultaneously only hiring technical staff members from New Mexico schools 
  and not allowing the Johnson Control Northern New Mexico contract to come up 
  for rebid. Isn't only hiring from local schools and not allowing competition 
  in service contracts a &quot;good old boy mentality?&quot; Maybe the concern 
  is not that there are good old boys, but who the good old boys are.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Additionally, for the 2000-2001 school year, Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
  had students from all 50 states. This would include New Mexico. Unfortunately, 
  any student &quot;dumb&quot; enough to leave New Mexico to attend school at 
  MIT would not be allowed to work at the Laboratory if these legislators had 
  their way. I also found this information on MIT's Web page:</p>
<p></p>
<p>&quot;We admit people for their brains and their resourcefulness, not for their 
  pedigree or their parents' income. We believe that anyone who demonstrates an 
  exceptional level of drive and commitment is entitled to the opportunities available 
  here, so we offer need-based financial aid.&quot;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&quot;Women and minorities have been a part of the MIT community since the 
  earliest days of the Institute. Our commitment to diversity isn't lip service; 
  it's as much a part of MIT as the bricks and mortar.&quot;</p>
<p></p>
<p>And lastly, I believe the Laboratory is a national resource and should be committed 
  to seeking out and hiring the brightest individuals from around the country 
  and around the world regardless of where these individuals live or went to school. 
  And there is nothing &quot;good old boy&quot; about that.</p>
