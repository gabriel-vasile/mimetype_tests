Supports North Dakota Small Business</b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3" face="Arial"><b><i>Praised For
Efforts To Bring Small Business Friendly Regulation To State</i></b></font></p>

<p><font size="2">WASHINGTON, D.C. &#150; Governor John Hoeven
was praised today for his efforts to bring small business
friendly regulation to North Dakota by Chief Counsel for Advocacy
Thomas M. Sullivan. Sullivan heads the federal office charged
with reducing regulatory barriers to entrepreneurial success.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Governor Hoeven worked closely with the
legislature to bring small business issues to the forefront of
the legislative session,&quot; said Sullivan. &quot;This
cooperation led to the signing of H.B. 1212, a bill that helps
make the North Dakota regulatory process more small business
friendly. Without his hard work and dedication to small business,
the bill would never have become law. I&#146;m proud to say that
North Dakota small business has a real champion in Governor
Hoeven,&quot; he said.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Signed by Governor Hoeven, H.B. 1212 implements
elements of small business friendly regulatory legislation put
forward as a model by the Office of Advocacy of the SBA. The
legislation is modeled after the federal Regulatory Flexibility
Act (RFA). That act encourages entrepreneurial success by
requiring federal agencies to consider their impact on small
business before they issue final regulations.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;The Office of Advocacy saved small
business owners over $21 billion in foregone regulatory
compliance costs last year alone,&quot; said Sullivan. &quot;We
did that by bringing the voice of small business to federal
agencies early in the regulatory process. The same thing can
happen in the states if they adopt the model legislation,&quot;
he said.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">By listening to small business, federal
agencies can ensure that funds, which would have been spent on
over burdensome new regulations, are instead available for hiring
new employees, purchasing new equipment, and making other
investments. At the same time, agencies still meet their
regulatory goals such as higher environmental quality, greater
travel safety, better workplace conditions, and increased family
financial security.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">North Dakota small businesses and their
representatives strongly back small business friendly regulation,
rather than a one-size-fits-all regulatory mentality. Testifying
in support before the legislature were the National Federation of
Independent Business, then president of the Mandan-Bismarck
Chamber of Commerce Dave McIver, and Fargo caterer John Carson.</font></p>
