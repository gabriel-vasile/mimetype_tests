      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>I. &nbsp;PURPOSE AND BACKGROUND</b></font> 
      </p>
      <p>The purpose of this Director's Order is to prescribe program policies 
        and procedures governing the acquisition, utilization, and disposal of 
        leased space for official use by park units and other NPS organizational 
        elements. This Order will also acquaint NPS managers with the basic procedures 
        of the General Services Administration (GSA) in their dealings with customer 
        agencies. NPS managers need to know about GSA procedures because the GSA 
        has lead authority and responsibility within the Federal Government for 
        leasing space to meet the needs of civilian agencies. GSA has published 
        in the Code of Federal Regulations, Subchapter C - Real Property (41 CFR 
        102-71 through 102-85) policies and procedures controlling the acquisition 
        of real property by lease. This Order is consistent with Subchapter C 
        and conforms to Department of the Interior (DOI) real property policies 
        as written in the Departmental Manual (425 DM 1 through 8). </p>
      <p>For purposes of this Order, &quot;leased space&quot; means any office, 
        warehouse, laboratory, visitor center, vehicle parking location, curatorial 
        storage facility, berthing facility or other property that is acquired 
        from an independent source by mutual agreement and used for official purposes 
        for a specific period of time. It does not include house trailers, self-storage 
        units, short-term lodging or temporary conference space.</p>
      <p>A basic understanding of policies and procedures on leasing is important 
        because the Service often depends on leased space to provide a quality 
        workplace environment that supports program operations, preserves the 
        value of real property assets, and reduces Federal work space to essential 
        minimum requirements. As one means to help achieve that goal, this Order 
        provides a uniform approach in acquiring leased space for park purposes. 
        It also provides guidance for making the most efficient use of all space 
        resources and encourages managers to fully use existing NPS-owned facilities 
        prior to entering into a lease. A related handbook will also be issued 
        for the benefit of personnel who need more detailed information about 
        leasing procedures.</p>
      <p>This Order does not address the policies and procedures for leasing Government-owned 
        property to others. Those policies are published in regulatory form in 
        36 CFR part 18, and in Director's Order #38 (Real Property Leasing).</p>
      <p><b>II. &nbsp;AUTHORITY TO ISSUE THIS ORDER</b></p>
      <p>The authority to issue this Director's Order is found in the 1916 NPS 
        Organic Act (16 U.S.C. 1 through 4) and in part 245 of the Department 
        of the Interior Manual.</p>
      <p><b>III. &nbsp;GSA LEASING POLICY</b></p>
      <p><b>A. &nbsp;General.</b> &nbsp;GSA leases privately owned land and building 
        space when needs cannot be met in Government-controlled space, such as 
        Federal office buildings and courthouses. GSA considers the advantages 
        of leasing in comparison with new construction, alterations to an existing 
        Federally controlled building, maintenance and operational efficiencies, 
        and the prevailing scale for comparable facilities in the community. GSA 
        acquires space by negotiation, with full and open competition among suitable 
        available locations that meet minimum government requirements. GSA is 
        obligated to enforce the provisions of 41 CFR part 102-73 (Real Estate 
        Acquisition) regarding location of Federal facilities, and the provisions 
        of section 110(a) of the National Historic Preservation Act regarding 
        the use of historic properties (41 CFR part 102-78).</p>
      <p><b>B. &nbsp;Lease Acquisition by GSA.</b> &nbsp;Although GSA is not obligated 
        to accept every request for service, it will generally, upon request and 
        on a reimbursable basis, perform all functions of leasing building space 
        and land incidental thereto (41 CFR parts 102-74 through 82). GSA services 
        include:</p>
      <p>&middot; Facility management (part 102-74).<br>
        &middot; Disposal of leased property that is no longer needed prior to 
        expiration of lease (part 102-75). <br>
        &middot; Design and construction of repairs and alterations to leased 
        property (part 102-76).<br>
        &middot; Meeting art in architecture requirements (part 102-77).<br>
        &middot; Historic preservation (part 102-78).<br>
        &middot; Design and utilization of leased space to provide a quality workplace 
        environment and support program operations (part 102-79).<br>
        &middot; Safety and environmental management (part 102-80).<br>
        &middot; Security and utility services (parts 102-81 &amp; 82). </p>
      <p><b>C. &nbsp;Customer Obligations.</b> &nbsp;As GSA customers, NPS officials 
        and employees are obligated to:<br>
        <br>
        &middot; Seek to economize requirements for space. <br>
        &middot; Periodically review space needs.<br>
        &middot; Give GSA early notice of new or changing space requirements. 
        And<br>
        &middot; Cooperate with and assist GSA in conducting leasing actions on 
        behalf of the NPS.</p>
      <p><b>D. &nbsp;Prohibition on Contacts.&nbsp;</b> Where the NPS is occupying 
        space leased by GSA, NPS officials and employees must not contact lessors, 
        offerors, brokers or potential offerors for the purpose of making oral 
        or written representations or commitments or agreements with respect to 
        the terms of occupancy of particular space, tenant improvements, alterations 
        and repairs, or payment of overtime services unless authorized to do so 
        by the Director of the Real Estate Division in the responsible GSA regional 
        office or facility support center. Such contacts may minimize GSA's ability 
        to negotiate options on behalf of the NPS if a potential lessor receives 
        unauthorized information that the Government is in need of space. Formal 
        and informal contacts are strictly unauthorized without GSA permission. 
        Likewise, where the NPS leases space under a delegation of authority, 
        contact may be made only with the permission of the NPS real property 
        contracting officer (RPCO), or the contracting officer's representative 
        (COR).</p>
      <p><b>IV. &nbsp;LEASING PROCEDURES</b></p>
      <p><b>A. &nbsp;Delegation of Authority.</b> &nbsp;The leasing authority 
        delegated by GSA to DOI, and re-delegated to the NPS Director, is further 
        re-delegated to the Comptroller. Under this re-delegation, the Comptroller 
        may perform all functions related to the leasing of &quot;general purpose&quot; 
        space in buildings and land incidental thereto. The Comptroller may also 
        perform all functions related to the leasing of categorical space and 
        special purpose space, as described in 41 CFR 101-18.104-2 and -3, such 
        as antenna and repeater sites, ranger stations, mooring facilities and 
        visitor centers. This authority is subject to the limitations contained 
        in 41 CFR part 102-72 &quot;Delegation of Authority.&quot; </p>
      <p><b>B. &nbsp;Locating Newly Leased Properties.</b> &nbsp;The NPS is responsible 
        for determining the delineated area where its facilities are to be located. 
        In compliance with Title VI of the Rural Development Act of 1972, first 
        priority must be given to the location of new offices and other facilities 
        in rural areas. If it would not be practical or feasible to locate a new 
        office or other facility in a rural area, the superintendent or manager 
        must provide a brief written justification explaining why. </p>
      <p>In satisfying space requirements in urban areas, first consideration 
        must be given to Central Business Areas (CBA) and other designated areas. 
        GSA may review requested delineated areas to ensure that this requirement 
        is met. In cases where the delineated area is in a non?CBA location, the 
        NPS manager must provide adequate justification to support the request. 
      </p>
      <p>If there is a conflict between the rural and CBA requirements the Service 
        will, if necessary, request assistance from GSA to find a satisfactory 
        resolution.</p>
      <p><b>C. &nbsp;Requesting Leased Space.</b> &nbsp;When a new requirement 
        for leased space is identified by a park or other NPS entity, the superintendent 
        or manager will document park needs by completing the SF?81 &quot;Request 
        for Space&quot; form, which may be found on the GSA website at www.fillform.gsa.gov. 
        This form is accompanied by an SF?81a, entitled &quot;Space Requirements 
        Worksheet,&quot; which is helpful in preparing detailed plans for new 
        space needs. </p>
      <p>All requests for leased space must be forwarded through the responsible 
        regional office for concurrence. If the regional office concurs in the 
        action, it will notify the Comptroller, who will then:</p>
      <p>&middot; Approve or disapprove those requests for which leasing authority 
        is delegated, following review and recommendation by an authorized NPS 
        real property contracting officer.<br>
        &middot; Forward requests for space in the Washington, DC metropolitan 
        area to the DOI National Business Center (NBC) for approval. NBC will 
        review and coordinate the space requirements with GSA. <br>
        &middot; Forward requests for space outside the Washington, DC metropolitan 
        area to the appropriate GSA regional office if internal real property 
        contracting officer resources are not available to complete the leasing 
        action. </p>
      <p>Regional and Center space management coordinators will maintain copies 
        of space requests and related correspondence. Regions and parks will not 
        independently seek to acquire new space through GSA without the Comptroller's 
        written concurrence. </p>
      <p><b>D. &nbsp;Exception for Leasing from a Non-profit Organization.</b> 
        &nbsp;Space may be leased from a non-profit educational organization, 
        historical society or tribal organization as part of a cooperative agreement 
        between NPS and the organization, provided that the space is simply one 
        component of the agreement. Before entering into such an agreement, the 
        responsible superintendent or manager should ensure that the Office of 
        the Solicitor has the opportunity to review the lease provisions of the 
        agreement and that the regional director is aware of, and concurs in, 
        the arrangement. Leases that are part of an overarching cooperative agreement 
        will not be covered under the central space account without the Comptroller's 
        written approval before the lease is signed.</p>
      <p><b>E. &nbsp;ANILCA Leases.</b> &nbsp;Section 1306 of the Alaska Native 
        Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) provides special authority for 
        leasing visitor and administrative sites outside NPS boundaries. Although 
        leases issued under ANILCA are not acquired under the delegation of authority 
        from GSA, in those circumstances where the central space account is paying 
        for the leased space, the Comptroller must approve the project before 
        a lease is signed.<br>
        <b><br>
        V. &nbsp;OCCUPANCY AGREEMENTS (OAs)</b></p>
      <p><b>A. &nbsp;What is an Occupancy Agreement?&nbsp;</b> GSA requires an 
        OA for each customer agency's space assignment. The OA must be agreed 
        to by GSA and the customer agency prior to commitment of agency funds 
        for occupancy and formal assignment of space. An OA: </p>
      <p>&middot; Defines GSA's relationship with each customer agency with regard 
        to an individual lease;<br>
        &middot; Describes the actual or proposed space and services to be provided, 
        and all associated actual costs to the customer during the term of occupancy;<br>
        &middot; Establishes specific financial terms, provisions, rights and 
        obligations of GSA and its customer for each space assignment; <br>
        &middot; Minimizes exposure to future unknown costs for both GSA and customer 
        agencies; <br>
        &middot; Stabilizes rent payments to the extent reasonable and desired 
        by customers; and <br>
        &middot; Allows tailoring of space and related services to meet customer 
        agency needs.</p>
      <p>The customer agency must sign the OA prior to GSA's making any major 
        contractual commitments associated with the space request. Typically, 
        this should occur at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>
      <p><b>B. &nbsp;Funding Commitment.</b>&nbsp; An OA obligates the customer 
        agency to fund the current year rent obligation owed GSA, as well as to 
        reimburse GSA for any other bona fide obligations that GSA may have incurred 
        on behalf of the customer agency. Therefore, only authorized GSA and customer 
        agency officials who can commit or obligate the funds of their respective 
        agencies can execute an OA. Although the OA is an interagency agreement 
        memorializing the understanding of GSA and its customer agency, the OA 
        may not be construed as obligating future year customer agency funds until 
        they are legally available. A multi-year OA commitment assumes the customer 
        agency will seek the necessary funding through budget and appropriations 
        processes. In the event that funding is reduced or eliminated, the obligation 
        to continue annual payments through the conclusion of the lease term remains 
        the responsibility of the tenant agency. At its discretion, GSA may terminate 
        an assignment upon being provided with 120 day written notice of intent 
        to vacate unless the property has been designated as &quot;unique agency 
        space.&quot;</p>
      <p><b>C. &nbsp;Authority to Sign an Occupancy Agreement.</b> &nbsp;New OAs 
        for which funding will be provided by the central GSA space account must 
        be approved and signed by the Comptroller. The Comptroller may delegate 
        this authority in writing, including to a regional director if a regional 
        staff member is certified as a warranted leasing officer and a copy of 
        the certificate of appointment is on file in the office of the Comptroller. 
      </p>
      <p>For new leases that will be funded through region or park operational 
        resources throughout the period of the lease, the region will provide 
        a copy to the Comptroller, along with a written commitment for funding 
        through other than the Servicewide GSA space account. These leases will 
        be limited to an annual cost of no more than $25,000. For agreements associated 
        with the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA, 16 U.S.C. 
        3101 through 3233), signature authority rests with the Alaska Regional 
        Director.</p>
      <p>The regional space management coordinator will coordinate new OAs with 
        the Comptroller; the Comptroller will coordinate the review and facilitate 
        the processing of agreements through GSA. </p>
      <p><b>VI. &nbsp;BUDGETARY CONSIDERATIONS</b></p>
      <p><b>A. &nbsp;Rent Charges.&nbsp;</b> Generally, rent for Federally owned 
        space provided by GSA is based on market appraisals of fully serviced 
        rental values for the predominant use of the building in the immediate 
        market area. Rent for leased space is based on the actual cost of the 
        lease, including the costs of services not provided by the lessor, plus 
        a GSA fee, and security charges and parking. The rent is based on the 
        terms and conditions of the OA, starting with the shell rent. The rent 
        will also include amortization of tenant improvement (TI) allowances used, 
        real estate taxes, operating costs, extra services, parking, GSA's fee 
        for its services, and charges for security, joint-use, and other applicable 
        rental charges, such as an antenna site, land, or wareyard (for exterior 
        storage).</p>
      <p><b>B. &nbsp;Funding Not Guaranteed.&nbsp;</b> Most expenses incurred 
        by the NPS for renting space through GSA are budgeted and paid centrally. 
        However, should regions/parks execute space agreements directly with GSA 
        (i.e. emergency space needs), the region/park is responsible for the cost. 
        All leases or Occupancy Agreements in these circumstances over $25,000 
        must still have the Comptroller's written approval before signature. Even 
        if a region chooses to execute an agreement for new space out of its funds, 
        the reprogramming requirements are still in effect. Because of the timing 
        of the Federal budget cycle, decisions about leased space must often be 
        made in advance of knowing whether increased funding will be available 
        to cover the costs associated with a particular lease. Parks, centers 
        and regions must be prepared to cover the costs of a lease in the event 
        additional funding is not forthcoming. Thus, regions should not forward 
        for WASO approval a proposed lease that the region is not prepared to 
        pay for out of park base or regional funds. Allowances for inflationary 
        increases (increases in rental bills resulting from escalator clauses 
        in the lease contract) are provided for by the WASO budget office by including 
        them in the annual budget request as base adjustments. </p>
      <p><b>C. &nbsp;Operational Formulation System (OFS) Entries.&nbsp;</b> Funding 
        requirements for space in a region will be identified, entered and prioritized 
        within OFS by the region. WASO requirements will be coordinated by the 
        Comptroller. As the Service's budget request is compiled each year, the 
        NPS will use these OFS entries to formulate the Service's request for 
        additional programmatic space to the DOI. As with other funding needs 
        of the Service, entry into OFS does not constitute an approved request. 
        Parks should not provide any indication to local community leaders that 
        a new facility will be leased or constructed without first checking with 
        the region and WASO on the status of the approval process. In some cases, 
        WASO will seek to budget for increased requirements, but if the budget 
        is not approved, the NPS will not proceed with the new space.</p>
      <p><b>D. &nbsp;Space Budget Justification.</b> &nbsp;Section 54.5 of OMB 
        Circular A-11 requires that the NPS provide detailed information on space 
        requirements for a multi-year period in each budget cycle. Detailed guidance 
        with respect to completing the six forms that make up the exhibit may 
        be found at http://www.gsa.gov/exhibit54. Individual regions must be able 
        to identify their space needs along with expected expenses, effective 
        dates, changes to inventory and explanation of the changes. As with OFS 
        entries, completion of this required OMB form does not constitute approval 
        of a new space request. Funding requests for projects must be identified 
        in Exhibit 54 in order to be fulfilled. </p>
      <p><b>E. &nbsp;Comptroller's Review.</b> &nbsp;The Comptroller's office 
        will review all OAs. If, after evaluation, the Comptroller's office does 
        not concur in acquiring the new space, it will recommend an alternative 
        budgetary approach or cancellation of the project to the Regional Director, 
        in accordance with the following guidelines:</p>
      <p><b>&middot; Forced moves.</b>&nbsp; Moves from existing leased space 
        mandated by terms of the lease or GSA must be identified to the Comptroller, 
        who will submit the action in the next budget request as an uncontrollable 
        cost. The Comptroller and responsible region, in consultation with GSA, 
        will determine the cost estimate and timing of the move. Should the region 
        propose a substantial increase (10% or greater) in the space requirement, 
        the action will be treated as a request for new space.</p>
      <p><b>&middot; Acquiring new or expanded space.&nbsp;</b> The added annual 
        cost of new or expanded space will be considered as a program increase 
        and presumed to be a commitment by the region as its highest priority 
        for an operational increase. The region must reflect this in an OFS request 
        and assign it the highest priority. In the event the NPS is not successful 
        in obtaining a budgetary increase for the new space, including build-to-suit 
        facilities, the region will be assessed the added cost, which will continue 
        until a budget increase is appropriated. </p>
      <p><b>&middot; Build-to-suit facilities.</b>&nbsp; If WASO receives a proposal 
        that provides for a facility to be built through a lease (in lieu of building 
        a facility and funding it through the construction account), there are 
        additional considerations. Projects funded through the construction account 
        compete for priority Servicewide and are scrutinized for cost and effectiveness 
        through the Development Advisory Board (DAB). Projects funded through 
        lease arrangements compete for operating funds through the OFS and budget 
        formulation process as previously discussed. The cost and budgetary consequences 
        of a lease for park facilities must be weighed carefully. Therefore, proposals 
        to acquire such space must include a justification for locating the facility 
        outside the park boundary and a life cycle cost analysis that compares 
        lease versus construction costs. The Comptroller, in consultation with 
        other members of the DAB, will determine if a project is of such size 
        and complexity as to require DAB review. Single purpose projects, such 
        as those needed for office or storage space, generally do not need to 
        be reviewed by the DAB. Proposals for multi-use facilities that serve 
        visitors will require DAB review. Regions may request construction planning 
        funds if needed for contractor support to prepare the cost analysis and 
        DAB documents. </p>
      <p><b>F. &nbsp;Tenant Improvements.&nbsp; </b>A Tenant Improvement (TI) 
        allowance enables the customer agency to design, configure and build out 
        space to support its program operations and is paid by the agency. If 
        alterations that are made by the agency exceed the TI allowance, this 
        is known as an &quot;above standard&quot; improvement. The cost of such 
        an improvement is paid in a one-time lump sum or amortized over the length 
        of the lease at the discretion of the Comptroller.</p>
      <p><b>VII. NON-BUDGETARY CONSIDERATIONS</b></p>
      <p><b>A. &nbsp;Socio-economic Considerations.</b> &nbsp;In acquiring space 
        by lease, GSA and the NPS will avoid locations that will result in a hardship 
        on employees. Hardship is defined as meeting both of the following conditions: 
        (1) there is a lack of adequate low- and moderate-income nondiscriminatory 
        housing for employees within reasonable proximity to the location, and 
        (2) the location is not readily accessible from other areas of the community. 
      </p>
      <p><b>B. &nbsp;Energy Conservation and Sustainable Design.&nbsp;</b> Executive 
        Order No. 13123 (Greening the Government Through Efficient Energy Management), 
        issued June 3, 1999, requires that agencies of the Federal Government 
        significantly improve energy management to save taxpayer dollars and reduce 
        emissions that contribute to air pollution and global climate change. 
        The order requires agencies to incorporate lease provisions that encourage 
        energy and water efficiency. Build-to-suit lease solicitations must contain 
        criteria encouraging sustainable design and development, energy efficiency 
        and verification of building performance. Agencies must include a preference 
        for buildings having the Energy Star building label in their selection 
        criteria for leasing buildings. Likewise, agencies must encourage lessors 
        to apply for the Energy Star building label, and explore and implement 
        projects that would reduce costs to the Federal Government.</p>
      <p><b>C. &nbsp;Locating Facilities Outside Park Boundaries.</b> &nbsp;The 
        Service has adopted a policy that it &quot;&#133;will not develop, or 
        re-develop, a facility within a park until a determination has been made 
        that the facility is necessary and appropriate, and that it would not 
        be practicable for the facility to be developed, or the service provided, 
        outside the park.&quot; (See 2001 NPS Management Policies, section 9.1.) 
        In cases where it would be practicable to develop the facility, or provide 
        the service, outside the park, leasing will sometimes be the method by 
        which it is done. One required consideration is to determine whether the 
        financial cost would be practicable.</p>
      <p><b>D. &nbsp;Historic Properties.</b>&nbsp; Section 110 of the National 
        Historic Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 470h-2) and Executive Order 13006 
        require federal agencies-prior to acquiring, constructing, or leasing 
        buildings -to use, to the maximum extent feasible, historic properties 
        available to it, whenever operationally appropriate and economically prudent 
        (16 U.S.C. 470h-2(a)(1)). The Act also requires each agency to implement 
        alternatives for the adaptive use of historic properties it owns, if that 
        will help ensure the properties' preservation. Therefore, the Service 
        will consider first the adaptive use of historic buildings to meet its 
        needs before leasing space in non-historic buildings. </p>
      <p>The Service will also minimize all adverse impacts on historic properties 
        to the extent that is feasible and prudent, and consult with the Advisory 
        Council on Historic Preservation and the State Historic Preservation Officer 
        regarding proposed undertakings. (Other specific NPS requirements regarding 
        the adaptive use of historic structures may be found in NPS Management 
        Policies sections 5.3.5.4.7, 9.1.1.4, and 9.4.3.3.) </p>
      <p>Contemporary use of an historic structure may subject the structure to 
        physical stresses for which it was not originally designed. These may 
        include increased floor load, heating and air conditioning upgrade, telecommunications, 
        accessibility requirements and additional electrical power needs. For 
        this reason, park managers should ensure that, if such a structure is 
        intended to be used as office, storage space or other adaptive use, it 
        will be given a full electrical and structural survey before it is altered 
        in any way or occupied by park staff.</p>
