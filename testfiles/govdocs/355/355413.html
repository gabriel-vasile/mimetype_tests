           OFFICIALLY BANNED ALL BEEF IN 1989. WHEN THE U.S. SOUGHT

           AGREEMENT ON TARIFFS AND TRADE PROCESS, THE RESULT WAS THE
           SAME. THE E.U.'S BAN WAS FOUND TO BE WITHOUT MERIT, AND IN
           VIOLATION OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE RULES. THAT WAS THE RULING --

           OTHER W.T.O. MEMBER-NATIONS FINDING THEMSELVES ON THE WRONG
           SIDE OF A W.T.O. RULING, HAVE ACTED RESPONSIBLY. MEMBERS OF THE
           SENATE MAY ASK WHAT'S HAPPENED IN OTHER CASES WHEN OTHER
           COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN FOUND TO BE IN NONCOMPLIANCE, TO HAVE
           VIOLATED THE W.T.O. AND THE RULINGS HAS COME DOWN AND THEY HAVE
           LOST THEIR CASE AND LOST THEIR APPEAL WHAT HAVE THEY DONE?
           THE ANSWER MR. PRESIDENT IS THAT THEY HAVE DONE WHAT YOU WOULD
           EXPECTS THEM TO DO. THEY HAVE COMPLIED. THE UNITED STATES HAS

           THE EUROPEAN UNION. NOW MR. PRESIDENT, RETALIATION IS THE ONLY
           AUTHORIZED TOOL TO BRING A COUNTRY INTO COMPLIANCE WITH W.T.O.
           RULINGS. THAT'S THE POINT OF THIS AMENDMENT, TO MAKE THIS
           AUTHORIZED RETALIATION MORE EFFECTIVE, AND TO GET THE JOB DONE.
           WHAT IS A NATION TO DO IF ITS CURRENT LIST OF IMPORTS SUBJECT
           TO RETALIATORY TARIFFS IS NOT WORKING TO MOVE THE OFFENDER LIKE
           THE E.U. INTO COMPLIANCE?

           THE SOLUTION, I BELIEVE, IS TO SEEK OTHER PRODUCTS TO TARGET
           AND AT TARIFF LEVELS THAT WOULD IMPOSE THE KIND OF PAIN THAT
           WILL CAUSE THE EUROPEAN UNION TO SEEK COMPLIANCE AS THE RELY
           DIP. THIS IS A PROCESS KNOWN AS CAROUSELING, THAT'S WHAT THIS
           AMENDMENT IS ABOUT. IN BOTH THE CASE WITH BANANAS AND THE CASE
           WITH BEEF, WE CAME FORWARD IN A LIST OF PRODUCTS THAT WE WERE

           GREATER DETAIL LATER WHEN I FORMALLY OFFER THIS AMENDMENT --
           BUT WHAT OUR AMENDMENT PROVIDES FOR IS THAT IF THE FIRST LIST
           OF ITEMS THAT WE ARE IMPOSING TARIFFS ON TO RETALIATE AGAINST
           THE E.U., IF THE FIRST LIST QUITE CANDIDLY DOESN'T INFLICT
           ENOUGH PAIN TO GET THEIR ATTENTION, THEN WE NEED TO CAROUSEL OR

           THE ITEMS MUST BE CHANGED. PROVIDES TT MANY CAN BE CHANGED, BUT
           AT LEAST ONE HAS TO BE CHANGED. AND THE WHOLE IDEA IS, IN THIS
           ONLY WAY THAT WE CAN GET THEIR ATTENTION, THE ONLY REMEDY THAT
           WE HAVE, THE ONLY TOOL THAT WE HAVE, THE ONLY STICK THAT WE
           HAVE, IS THIS TYPE OF RETALIATION. WE MUST MAKE SURE IT IS
           EFFECTIVE. AND WE MUST MAKE SURE THE CORRECT PRODUCTS ARE BEING
           CHOSEN THAT DO INFLICT THE PAIN TO GET THE ATTENTION OF THE
           E.U., AND THAT'S WHAT THIS AMENDMENT IS ALL ABOUT. IT IS A
