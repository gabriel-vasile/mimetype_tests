My concern with this ruling if it were to pass is that it would negatively impact my business in the following ways:  the 7 day waiting period will certainly cool someone's enthusiam to purchase the product and if this potential buyer is not from your local area you have to get the address, phone numbers, etc., of local distributors from the corporate office to give them and this will take even longer to get things done. Not to mention the invasion of privacy this creates due to the fact that we don't have store front business and we work from our home that now anybody who wanted to could have a lot of my personal info.  This in my opinion stifles an entrepreneurship mentality that makes America so great and makes us move to a store front mentality and the cost and overhead entailed in that defeats the purpose of having this home based business. Also, why is it important to disclose all legal proceedings that may not be complete yet?  This could in fact give the wrong perception of this company, good or bad.  I feel you could do what you want with this Business Opportunity Rule &quot;RS511993&quot; but still protect the right of the honest Americans that are trying to make a better living out here. Could this rule be directed somehow at all business that have complaints and judgements on them and set guidelines to stop further business opportunities that do not meet the criteria set out?  Once again, thank you for doing a hard job and your willingness to take on a difficult issue and thank you for giving me this forum to speak out. Good luck and God Bless You. Sincerly, Travis and Tammi Clement</body></html>
