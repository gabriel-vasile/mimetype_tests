Inspection, Maintenance and Monitoring of Service and Emergency Spillways
Daniel L. Johnson
MWH Americas

Current Condition
* Change in Mentality
* Attention paid to safety of dams
* Understanding of design events
* Owners’ awareness

FEMA Workshop - Issues, Remedies and Research Needs Relating to Service and/or Emergency Spillways

Levels of Experience
* Rarity of large flood events
* Denver snowstorm of 1913
* Big Thompson Flood of 1976
* South Platte Flood of 1965
* Events do occur and spillways are leading cause of failures

FEMA Workshop - Issues, Remedies and Research Needs Relating to Service and/or Emergency Spillways

Personnel Issues
* Inspection Knowledge Needed
* Failure modes
* Service spillways see more use than emergency spillways
* Emergency spillway may have never been used

FEMA Workshop - Issues, Remedies and Research Needs Relating to Service and/or Emergency Spillways

Inspection Issues
* Capability to meet design criteria
* Conditions and components for successful operation
- Located on abutment
- Located on dam
* Condition assessment
* Changes with time

FEMA Workshop - Issues, Remedies and Research Needs Relating to Service and/or Emergency Spillways

Inspection Issues
* Observation of operation
* Annual flood
* 5, 10 and 25 year flood
* Normal flows give indication of ability for successful operations
* Normal flows may be most critical for maintenance

FEMA Workshop - Issues, Remedies and Research Needs Relating to Service and/or Emergency Spillways

Maintenance
* Maintenance is typically not frequent
* Emergency spillway may be forgotten
* Repairs are necessary to maintain in as-designed condition
* Concrete
	- Movement, foundation erosion, toe and head erosion
* Earth
	- Slope protection, erosion of channel, abutments, toe, head
* Deleterious materials

FEMA Workshop - Issues, Remedies and Research Needs Relating to Service and/or Emergency Spillways

Special Issue
* Over-the-dam spillways need additional attention
* Frequent use as they are cost effective using RCC
* Induces new failure mode
* Increases frequency of emergency spillway usage

Monitoring
* Monitoring is needed
	- to estimate performance
	- to set a maintenance/rehabilitation plan
* Measurements of
	- movement, cracking, deterioration, aging issues
* Documentation of
	- surveys, photos, checklists and notes

FEMA Workshop - Issues, Remedies and Research Needs Relating to Service and/or Emergency Spillways

Data Usage
* Review of monitoring data
	- by personnel experienced and qualified
* When first gathered to understand current condition
	- as comparison to historic records for evaluating changes
* Reporting of results to owner and safety agencies

Conclusion
* Spillways constructed of engineered materials age
* Criteria may not be up to date
* Modern designs may have less robust components
* Inspection, maintenance and monitoring may be last hope

Problem Statements:
* Spillway erosion analysis encounters variable nature of geometry, geologic material and unpredictable flood events.
* Dam Safety Portfolio Analysis needs a tool to determine the probability of spillway damage.

Risk Assessment
Process of Answering Three Questions
1. What can go wrong?
2. What is the likelihood it will go wrong?
3. What are the consequences if it does go wrong?
