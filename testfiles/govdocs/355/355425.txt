I'm in favor of more support for technology in the classroom,
especially in the area of Internet and electronic mail.   I would
also like to have the business community regulated so we have
more quality programs and less quanity.   We don't need more
channels.  We need the channels we have to be used to promote
literacy.   Not literacy only in the basics but in the classics. 
Many of our citizens today are victims of "trash" entertainment
and consider that "good" art.   I realize we cannot dictate each
individuals taste or "wants"  but we seem to live in a society
ruled by a big business mentality that believes we should give
the general populace what they "want."
Do you give a child what they want?  Is that the way we are to
raise our children?  We must consider that an uneducated 
populace is like a child.  In proper parenting you give the child
choices.  But make sure those choices are well presented.  
          It comes back to that same word we hear so often as of
late: responsibility.  We have a responsibility to our society
outside  of, and more important than material gain.  In ancient
cultures lessons were taught by elders passing down moral tales
to  enforce behavior and regulate the survivial of society.  
     I am suggesting that our elders--big business--are not good
elders.  They have not learned to be good stewards of our
society.
Somehow we have to get that back.

     Forgive me for begining  to ramble.  I'm a writer and as
such I think through my fingertips.  I just ran across this spot
on the net  while looking for something else in your agency.  I
would like to think it through some more and respond with
suggestions rather than mere comments.
