Comptroller of the Currency
Before the 
Independent Bankers Association of Texas
San Antonio, Texas

     I'm sure that IBAT was as relieved as any group in America when we
heard the announcement that the players' union and the major league
baseball owners had reached a settlement in their labor dispute.  After
all the work that had gone into developing this year's conference theme,
it would have been a real pity had it come to stand as nothing more than a
reminder that the national pastime had shut down for the season,
disappointing millions of fans and putting thousands of people out of
work.  Thankfully, the games continue, the playoffs and the World Series
loom, and I'm pleased to be joining IBAT once again, at its own annual
fall classic.

     As we contemplated the possibility of a baseball strike, I heard
plenty of speculation that another strike might spell the demise of
baseball as we know it - that this time, the fans might cast the final
vote with their feet.  Frankly, I never thought there was much chance of
that happening. Despite the economic challenges that the game faces, it's
always been part of our national identity.

     Of course, people once said the same thing about cock
fighting, corn husking, and minstrel shows - once popular
pursuits that no one pursues any more. It reminds us tastes and
habits change -- that nothing is forever.

     The question that has been much discussed of late is
whether community banking will share in the fate of other
venerable institutions overtaken by time and events - or whether
it can marshal the endurance, adaptability, and political
support necessary to avoid such a fate.  Certainly there's no
shortage of pessimists about the future of community banking -
and little dispute about some of the particulars of their basic
argument. Community banks are disappearing at an alarming rate -
nearly one a day, on average.  Some have fallen to merger and
acquisition, while others have succumbed to weak fundamentals,
such as shrinking loan margins, a consumer mentality that
focuses on small differences in price to the exclusion of all
other considerations, and, above all, the absence of the
economies of scale that might otherwise make the numbers work.

     Let me give you an example I can speak to with some
authority. In terms of your overall expenses, the cost of
regulatory compliance ranks pretty far down the list.  At least
I hope it does. But it's a conspicuous cost because - to be
frank about it - it's a cost whose benefits aren't always
obvious.

     Year after year our friends in Congress add new mandates
for consumer protection, community service, and more, and expect
the regulators to enforce them.  But the costs all come back to
you, in the form of the people you have to pay to do the extra
legwork and paperwork the law requires, and in the form of the
supervisory assessments you have to pay us so that our examiners
can certify that you're in compliance with the law.

     Big banks don't like this any better than small ones do.
They just don't seem to feel it as much.

     Community banks are feeling these pressures more than ever
before, partly because they are more exposed to big bank
competition than ever before.  There are no sheltered markets
anymore -- only places your competitors have chosen not to go.
The advent of true nationwide branching is one manifestation of
that; improvements in technology, which brings remote delivery
of financial services within reach of millions, is another; and
the removal of statutory prohibitions on the types of products
and services that integrated financial institutions can offer is
a third. Together, these market and regulatory changes add up to
what is probably the most challenging competitive environment
for community banking in decades.

     A cursory look at the numbers here in Texas - one of the
nation's traditional strongholds of community banking -- seems
to support what the analysts say about the unstoppable momentum
of financial services consolidation and community bank
evaporation.  In 1998, there were 798 commercial banks in
operation statewide.  As of the middle of this year, the number
was down to 675 - a drop of nearly 15 percent. Roughly 13,000
fewer people work in Texas banking today than four years ago.
Some of those same people might have once worked for you.

     But to me the remarkable thing is not that there's been
some contraction in the banking industry.  Given the number of
banks with which we began, contraction was a foregone
conclusion, especially in a softening economy.  And the Texas
economy, while no softer than most, has been affected by a
variety of circumstances unique to it.  I'm speaking now of the
state's heavy reliance on agriculture, which has been buffeted
by drought and low commodity prices; weakness in the Mexican
economy, to which the state's fortunes are so closely linked;
and fallout from the collapse of Enron and related businesses.

     In light of these bumps and bruises, I think we should be
focusing on a different set of numbers - the actual performance
and condition ratios of Texas banks. They tell a story of
resilience and underlying strength -- notwithstanding the dire
pronouncements of the industry analysts.

     Consider these 2001 numbers, using 1998 - a strong growth
year -- as a comparative benchmark. Return on equity, up. Return
on assets, up. Net charge-offs, down. Capital, up.  Noncurrent
loans, down.

     And the outlook for the near term is equally positive.
Many of you have reported a recent surge in retail deposits, as
individual investors seek sanctuary from the turbulence on Wall
Street in banks on Main Street.  Coupled with rising loan
demand, which seems likely as the national recovery gains speed,
community banks in Texas and throughout the country may be
poised to realize major gains to the bottom line.

     Some would have you believe that community bankers have
done nothing more than to prove the importance of good timing,
suggesting that you've been accidental beneficiaries of trends
you've had no hand in shaping. I don't share that view. I
believe, rather, (and the numbers confirm this), that the
community bank business model, with its emphasis on personal
service, is fundamentally sound.  I believe that the skill that
bankers like you have brought to the business has been
instrumental in proving the so-called experts wrong - at least
so far.  Most of all, I believe that the role you play in the
markets you serve is crucial to the health of our communities
and to the national economy. Your ability to react quickly and
rationally to local credit needs, to price fairly, and to
provide customers with a wide range of banking and related
financial products, is indispensable - and irreplaceable.

     I should hasten to add that while all of these factors have
played a role in your past success, none of it guarantees that
this success will continue. As I've said, peoples' habits do
change -- whether it's the games they watch and play or the way
they save and invest.

     In my view, the value you contribute is too important to be
left to chance or to the sometimes-merciless whims of the
marketplace. So I believe that the regulatory and legislative
policies of our government must explicitly embrace the interests
of community banks - much as we have embraced the interests of
family farms or small business generally -- as a matter of
fundamental national importance. Without taking anything away
from your great skills as bank managers, I am convinced that
such an embrace is crucial to the continued success - and long-
term survival - of our nation's community banking sector.

     I am not in any way implying that the interests of
community banks should prevail at the expense of large banks.
Big banks make their own outsized contribution to America's
international competitiveness and economic health.  Supporting
one sector on an industry is not equivalent to oppressing
another. The goal of economic regulation, after all, is to
achieve the appropriate parity between efficiency and equity - a
goal that's consistent with recognition of the fact that our
supervisory and regulatory policies have disproportionate impact
on the well being of community banks.

     Some may accuse the OCC of being a latecomer to this view.
There seems to be a notion out there - and it's nothing new --
that we're "the big bank regulator," and that we're less attuned
to the needs and concerns of community banks than, say, our
colleagues at the state banking departments and at the FDIC.
But let me ask you this: can we be accurately referred to as the
"big bank regulator" when nearly 2000 of the 2300 national banks
that we're responsible for are community banks with assets under
$1 billion?  And half of that number - 1000 national banks -
holds less than $100 million in assets.

     And is it fair to characterize the OCC as indifferent to
the needs of community banks when more than 1300 of our
examiners - nearly 80 percent of the OCC's total examination
force - is dedicated to community bank supervision?  I'm
referring to 1300 highly trained professionals, men and women
who are widely acknowledged to be the very best in the business
at what they do.  Most of them have deep roots in the
communities whose banks they serve.

     I should add that we restructured our procedures several
years ago so that those same local examiners and front-line
supervisors - we call them Assistant Deputy Comptrollers -- make
90 percent of the decisions that affect your institutions. That
move was designed to take advantage of the depth of experience -
averaging more than 20 years - possessed by our ADCs.

     I don't think we can fairly be accused of being
unresponsive to the banks we supervise when, in 2001 alone, the
OCC sponsored nearly 200 outreach events around the country - a
number that doesn't include the many events sponsored by others
that we attend or the dozens of meetings that we hold with state
banking associations delegations when they come to Washington.
I was pleased to welcome Chris, Steve, and a large IBAT
delegation to our offices just a few months ago, and look
forward to welcoming you back.  Let me assure you that there
will always be an open door - and a warm spot in our hearts -
for IBAT at the OCC.

     In our case, numbers alone - number of smaller banks that
we supervise and the number of examiners assigned to them --
tell only part of the story of our commitment to the health of
community banking.  It's reflected in our whole approach to
supervision, which draws on procedures formulated especially for
community banks.  These procedures take a risk-focused approach
that allows for streamlined, efficient examinations.  We focus
on practices and outcomes - an approach designed to get
examiners in and out of your bank as quickly as possible with
the information that they need to provide effective supervision.

     Our commitment to community banks is also reflected in our
sensitivity to regulatory burden - and an appreciation of how
profoundly community banks can be affected by it.  Today we
don't issue a regulation without first conducting a community
bank impact analysis.  Where we find that the costs of a given
regulation to community banks is out of proportion to the
benefits that regulation is likely to bring to the industry and
the public we'll step back and reconsider it.

     Technology offers tremendous potential for reducing
regulatory burden, and we're aggressively exploring possible
ways to automate supervisory communications and the examination
process itself. I believe that the day is not far off when most
of the exchanges between bankers and regulators will take place
through systems like the OCC's National BankNet.  Before much
longer you'll be able to comment on proposed regulations, pay
your regulatory assessment, and file corporate applications -
all online.

     And we're working to give examiners the ability to perform
even more of their routine supervisory duties remotely.  That
will mean fewer burdens on you - less staff time preparing for
exams, less time producing paperwork, and a less intrusive
examiner presence on-site.

     Burden reduction was an important consideration behind the
adoption of our Canary early warning system - a system that, as
many of you have heard, is designed to enhance our ability to
identify and respond to emerging risks.  Canary enables us to
zero in on those banks that have the greatest amount of
financial risk and the greatest possibility of problems. By the
same token, it also enables us to avoid imposing undue burden on
well-managed institutions.  If your bank is one of those - and
the vast majority of community banks fall squarely into the
well-managed category - Canary can result in real reductions in
regulatory burden.

     But I can assure you that whether yours is a troubled
institution, a problem-free institution, or something in
between, your examiner will be there for you. No matter how much
technology enables us to conduct supervision remotely, an
on-site presence will always be a central component of the
supervisory relationship.

     Many bankers prize that relationship.  They tell me that
they use our examiners like all- purpose consultants -- and for
good reason, because in the ranks of OCC examiners are men and
women whose expertise on a whole range of banking subjects is
recognized throughout the nation and around the world. I know
that some banks opt for a national charter precisely because the
organizers know they can count on expertise furnished by our
examiners to help them make it through the always-challenging
start-up period.

     But community banks that are also national banks pay for
the privilege - and pay more than they should have to, in my
judgment.  The unfair financial burden that you bear is the
result of what I believe is a serious flaw in our whole system
of bank supervision.  Although the OCC assessment schedule is
progressive -- that is, large national banks pay more than their
pro rata share of the costs of their supervision -- the
assessments you pay as national banks are still considerably
higher than you'd be paying under a state charter.  You know
this, and so do we.

     This fee disparity is the result of a system under which
the Federal Reserve and the FDIC provide the federal supervision
of state-chartered banks - indeed, they perform for state banks
virtually every function we perform for national banks -- but
they don't charge those banks for their services.  Instead, the
resources used by the FDIC for this purpose are provided in
large part by national banks, which account for more than half
of the balance in the Bank Insurance Fund.

     In other words, national banks are effectively subsidizing
the supervision of your state bank competitors.

     And because the states themselves actually provide only a
small part of the total supervision their banks require, the
states can afford to charge less -- much less -- than a
comparable national bank pays to the OCC, which provides all of
its supervision.

     We believe that this arrangement is patently unfair to
national banks and harmful to the dual banking system, and I
have repeatedly urged Congress to address this issue in the
context of deposit insurance reform.  Everyone agrees that banks
should contribute to the insurance funds based on the risks they
present, and that healthy banks should not be required to bear
the costs and risks of providing deposit insurance to poorly
managed institutions.  We strongly believe that the same
principle of equity should apply to supervisory assessments as
well, and that the fee disparity between national and state
banks should be eliminated.

     Let me emphasize that the OCC is not proposing -- and never
has, as long as I've been Comptroller - that the fee disparity
problem be resolved by charging additional fees to state banks.
Our proposed solution, which would draw on FDIC revenues to fund
all supervision, would benefit state banks every bit as much as
national banks.

     Our commitment to community banks is also reflected in OCC
policies designed to assist national banks in keeping up with
the demands of a highly competitive financial marketplace.  For
example, we launched a pilot program that allows national banks
with the highest supervisory ratings to exceed the customary 15
percent limit on loans to a single borrower where the limit is
higher for state-chartered institutions.  It was designed
exclusively for community banks, which may now be in a position
to compete favorably for larger borrowers who previously had to
go elsewhere to meet their financing needs.

     It's just another way that the OCC has "stepped up to the
plate" to support the interests of community banks.

     I opened my remarks by suggesting that the coming years
would be decisive ones for community banks -- and for the
organizations, like IBAT, that speak for them.  In that vein,
let me offer one final thought. While regulatory sensitivity to
community banking's unique needs is important, the future of
community banking in America will not be determined by
government action -- or inaction.  All the government support in
the world won't be enough if your customers feel ill served or
inadequately served banking with you. They will regret it if
they have to go elsewhere to have their financial needs well and
comprehensively met, but most of them will go nonetheless. The
challenge for community bankers is to help your customers make
the decision that's right for them - and right for you.

The OCC charters, regulates and examines approximately 2,200
national banks and 52 federal branches of foreign banks in the
U.S., accounting for more than 54 percent of the nation's
banking assets. Its mission is to ensure a safe and sound and
competitive national banking system that supports the citizens,
communities and economy of the United States.
