<H2><B>NASA SHARED SAVINGS CLAUSE</B></H2>
<P>
<I><B>PURPOSE:</B></I>   To establish the conditions for use and
the administrative procedures for a &quot;Shared Savings Clause&quot;
to be used in solicitations and contracts.
<P>
<I><B>BACKGROUND:  </B></I>On October 20, 1995, a proposed rule
to amend the NFS to add a &quot;Shared Savings Clause&quot; was
published in the Federal Register (60 FR 54208).  The intent of
the clause was to provide an incentive for contractors to identify
and implement significant cost reduction programs.  In return,
they would be eligible for a share of realized savings which resulted
from those cost-cutting projects once they were approved by the
contracting officer.
<P>
<I><B>REGULATIONS:</B></I>  Subpart 1843.71 and section 1852.243-71
are added as set forth in the enclosed pages to the NFS.
<P>
<I><B>REPLACEMENT PAGES:</B></I>  You may use the enclosed pages
to replace Structure page 7, Structure page 8, TOC 43:1, TOC 52:3,
TOC 52:4, 52-87, 52-88, 52-117 and 52-118 of the NFS.  You may
also use the enclosed page to add 52-88.1, 52-88.2, 52-88.3 and
52-88.4 of the NFS.  
<P>
<I><B>REGULATORY COMPLIANCE:</B></I>  This PN has been published
as a final rule in the Federal Register (61 FR  64823 - 64825,
December 9, 1996).
<P>
<I><B>EFFECTIVE DATE:</B></I>  This PN is effective as dated and
shall remain in effective until cancelled or superseded.

<H3>1843.7101  Shared Savings Program.</H3>

<P>
  This subpart establishes and describes the methods for implementing
and administering a Shared Savings Program.  This program provides
an incentive for contractors to propose and implement, with NASA
approval, significant cost reduction initiatives.  NASA will benefit
as the more efficient business practices that are implemented
lead to reduced costs on current and follow-on contracts.   In
return, contractors are entitled to share in cost savings subject
to limits established in the contract.  The contracting officer
may require the contractor to provide periodic reporting, or other
justification, or to require other steps (e.g., cost segregation)
to ensure projected cost savings are being realized.  
<H3>1843.7102  Solicitation provision and contract clause. </H3>

<P>
  The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.243-71,
Shared Savings, in all solicitations and contracts expected to
exceed $1,000,000, except those awarded under FAR Part 12, NRA,
or AO procedures, or those awarded under the SBIR or STTR programs.
 
<P>
<B>1852.243-70  Engineering Change Proposals.</B>
<P>
  As prescribed in 1843.205-70(a), insert the following clause,
modified to suit contract type:
<P>
<B>ENGINEERING CHANGE PROPOSALS</B>
<P>
<B>(OCTOBER 1995)</B>
<P>
  (a)  Definitions.
<P>
<I><B>   &quot;ECP&quot;</B></I>  means an Engineering Change
Proposal (ECP) which is a proposed engineering change and the
documentation by which the change is described, justified, and
submitted to the procuring activity for approval or disapproval.
<P>
  <I><B>&quot;MIL-STD-973&quot;</B></I> means a DOD publication
entitled,  Military Standard Configuration Control - Engineering
Changes, Deviations and Waivers, 15 July 1988.
<P>
  (b)  Either party to the contract may originate ECPs.  The originator
shall forward proposed ECPs to the Contracting Officer.  Unless
otherwise required by the Contracting Officer, the ECP formats,
forms and controls specified in MIL-STD-973 shall be used.  Implementation
of an approved ECP may occur by either a supplemental agreement
or, if appropriate, as a written change order to the contract.
<P>
  (c)  Any ECP submitted to the Contracting Officer shall include
a &quot;not-to-exceed&quot; <U>     </U>  [price or estimated
cost] increase or decrease adjustment amount, if any, and the
required [time of delivery or period of performance]  adjustment,
 if  any,  acceptable  to the originator of the ECP.  If the change
is originated within the Government, the Contracting Officer shall
obtain a written agreement with the contractor regarding the &quot;not-to-exceed&quot;
 <U>     </U> [price or estimated cost] and  [delivery or period
of performance]  adjustments, if any, prior to issuing an order
for implementation of the change.
<P>
  (d)  Concurrent with the submission of an ECP, the contractor
shall, in accordance with FAR 15.804-6, provide a completed Standard
Form 1411, Contract Pricing Proposal Cover Sheet (Cost or Pricing
Data Required), with appropriate attachments.  At the time of
agreement on the <U>     </U>  [price or estimated cost]  amount,
the contractor may be required to execute and submit to the Contracting
Officer a Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data (FAR 15.804-2
and 15.804-4).

at the end of paragraph (c) of the basic clause:
<P>
  An ECP accepted in accordance with the Changes clause of this
contract shall not be considered an authorization to the Contractor
to exceed the estimated cost in the contract Schedule, unless
the estimated cost is increased by the change order or other contract
modification.
<H6><B>1852.243-71  Shared Savings.</B></H6>

<H6>  As prescribed in 1843.7102, insert the following clause:
</H6>

<H6><B>SHARED SAVINGS</B></H6>

<P>
<B>(DECEMBER 1996)</B> 
<P>
  (a)  The Contractor is entitled, under the provisions of this
clause, to share in cost savings resulting from the implementation
of cost reduction projects which are presented to the Government
in the form of Cost Reduction Proposals (CRP) and approved by
the Contracting Officer.  These cost reduction projects may require
changes to the terms, conditions or statement of work of this
contract.  Any cost reduction projects must not change the essential
function of any products to be delivered or the essential purpose
of services to be provided under the contract. 
<P>
  (b)  <B>Definitions:</B>
<P>
        (1)  <I><B>Cost savings</B></I>, as contemplated by this
clause, means savings that result from instituting changes to
the covered contract, as identified in an approved Cost Reduction
Proposal.  
<P>
       (2)  <B>Cost Reduction Proposal (CRP) </B>- For the purposes
of this clause, a Cost Reduction Proposal means a proposal that
recommends alternatives to the established procedures and/or organizational
support of a contract or group of contracts.  These alternatives
must result in a net reduction of contract cost and price to NASA.
 The proposal will include technical and cost information sufficient
to enable the Contracting Officer to evaluate the CRP and approve
or disapprove it. 
<P>
      (3) <I><B>Covered contract</B></I> - As used in this clause,
covered contract means the contract, including unexercised options
but excluding future contracts, whether contemplated or not, against
which the CRP is submitted.
<P>
      (4)<I><B>  Contractor implementation costs</B></I> - As
used in this clause, contractor implementation costs, or &quot;implementation
costs&quot;, shall mean those costs which the Contractor incurs
on covered contracts specifically in developing, preparing, submitting,
and negotiating a CRP, as well as those costs the Contractor will
incur on covered contracts to make any structural or organizational
changes in order to implement an approved CRP.
<P>
     (5)  <I><B>Government costs</B></I> - As used in this clause,
the term government costs means internal costs of NASA, or any
other government agency, which result directly from development
and implementation of the CRP.  These may include, but are not
limited to, costs associated with the administration of the contract
or with such contractually related functions such as testing,
operations, maintenance and logistics support.  These costs also
include costs associated with other Agency contracts (including
changes in contract price or cost and fee) that may be affected
as a result of the implementation of a CRP.  They do not include
the normal administrative costs of reviewing and processing the
CRP.
<P>
  (c)  <B>General.</B>  The Contractor will develop, prepare and
submit CRPs with supporting information, as detailed in paragraph
(e) of this clause, to the Contracting Officer.  The CRP will
 describe the proposed cost reduction activity in sufficient detail
to enable the Contracting Officer to evaluate it and to approve
or disapprove it.  The Contractor shall share in any net cost
savings realized from approved and implemented CRPs in accordance
with the terms of this clause.  The Contractor's actual percentage
share of the cost savings shall be a matter for negotiation with
the Contracting Officer, but shall not, in any event, exceed 50
percent of the total cost savings recognized by the Contracting
Officer.  The Contractor may propose changes in other activities
that impact performance on its contract, including government
and other contractor operations, if such changes will optimize
cost savings.  A Contractor shall not be entitled to share, however,
in any cost savings that are internal to the Government, or which
result from changes made to any contracts to which it is not a
party even if those changes were proposed as a part of its CRP.
 Early communication between the Contractor and the Government
is encouraged.  The communication may be in the form of a concept
paper or preliminary proposal.  The Government is not committed
to accepting any proposal as a result of these early discussions.
<P>
  (d)  <B>Computation of cost savings.</B>  The cost savings to
be shared between the Government and the Contractor will be computed
by the Contracting Officer by comparing a current estimate to
complete (ETC) for the covered contract, as structured before
implementation of the proposed CRP, to a revised ETC which takes
into account the implementation of that CRP.  The cost savings
to be shared shall be reduced by any cost overrun, whether experienced
or projected, that is identified on the covered contract before
implementation of the CRP.  Although a CRP may result in cost
savings that extend far into the future, the period in which the
Contractor may share in those savings will be limited to no more
than five years.   Implementation costs of the Contractor must
be considered and specifically identified in the revised ETC.
 The Contracting Officer shall offset Contractor cost savings
by any increased costs (whether implementing or recurring) to
the Government when computing the total cost savings to be shared.
 The Contractor shall not be entitled, under the provisions of
this clause, to share in any cost reductions to the contract that
are the result of changes stemming from any action other than
an approved CRP.  However, this clause does not limit recovery
of any such reimbursements that are allowed as a result of other
contract provisions.
<P>
  (e)  <B>Supporting Information.</B>  As a minimum, the Contractor
shall provide the following supporting information with each CRP:
<P>
      (1)  Identification of the current contract requirements
or established procedures and/or organizational support which
are proposed to be changed.
<P>
     (2)  A description of the difference between the current
process or procedure and the proposed change.  This description
shall address how proposed changes will meet NASA requirements
and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the existing practice
and the proposed changes.
<P>
     (3)  A list of contract requirements which must be revised,
if any, if the CRP is approved, along with proposed revisions.
 Any changes to NASA or delegated contract management processes
should also be addressed.
<P>
     (4)  Detailed cost estimates which reflect the implementation
costs of the CRP.
<P>
     (5)  An updated ETC for the covered contract, unchanged,
and a revised ETC for the covered contract which reflects changes
resulting from implementing the CRP.  If the CRP proposes changes
to only a limited number of elements of the contract, the ETCs
need only address those portions of the contract that have been
impacted.  Each ETC shall depict the level of costs incurred or
to be incurred by year, or to the level of detail required by
the Contracting Officer.  If other CRPs have been proposed or
approved on a contract, the impact of these CRPs must be addressed
in the computation of the cost savings to ensure that the cost
savings identified are attributable only to the CRP under consideration
in the instant case.
<P>
     (6)  Identification of any other previous submissions of
the CRP, including the dates submitted, the agencies and contracts
involved, and the disposition of those submittals.
<P>
  (f) <B> Administration.</B>
<P>
      (1)  The Contractor shall submit proposed CRPs to the Contracting
Officer who shall be responsible for the review, evaluation and
approval.  Normally, CRPs should not be entertained for the first
year of performance to allow the Contracting Officer to assess
performance against the basic requirements.  If a cost reduction
project impacts more than a single contract, the contractor may,
upon concurrence of the Contracting Officer's responsible for
the affected contracts,  submit a single CRP which addresses fully
the cost savings projected on all affected contracts that contain
this Shared Savings Clause.  In the case of multiple contracts
affected, responsibility for the review and approval of the CRP
will be a matter to be decided by the affected Contracting Officers.

<P>
     (2)  Within 60 days of receipt, the Contracting Officer shall
complete an initial evaluation of any proposed cost reduction
plan to determine its feasibility.  Failure of the Contracting
Officer to provide a response within 60 days shall not be construed
as approval of the CRP.  The Government shall promptly notify
the Contractor of the results of its initial evaluation and indicate
what, if any, further action will be taken.  If the Government
determines that the proposed CRP has merit, it will open discussions
with the Contractor to establish the cost savings to be recognized,
the Contractor's share of the cost savings, and a payment schedule.
 The Contractor shall continue to perform in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the existing contract until a contract
modification is executed by the Contracting Officer.  The modification
shall constitute approval of the CRP and shall incorporate the
changes identified by the CRP, adjust the contract cost and/or
price, establish the Contractor's share of cost savings, and incorporate
the agreed to payment schedule.
<P>
     (3)  The Contractor will receive payment by submitting invoices
to the Contracting Officer for approval.  The amount and timing
of individual payments will be made in accordance with the schedule
to be established with the Contracting Officer.  Notwithstanding
the overall savings recognized by the Contracting Officer as a
result of an approved CRP, payment of any portion of the Contractor's
share of savings shall not be made until NASA begins to realize
a net cost savings on the contract (i.e., implementation, startup
and other increased costs resulting from the change have been
offset by cumulative cost savings).  Savings associated with unexercised
options will not be paid unless and until the contract options
are exercised.  It shall be the responsibility of the Contractor
to provide such justification as the Contracting Officer deems
necessary to substantiate that cost savings are being achieved.
  
<P>
     (4)  Any future activity, including a merger or acquisition
undertaken by the Contractor (or to which the Contractor becomes
an involved party), which has the effect of reducing or reversing
the cost savings realized from an approved CRP for which the Contractor
has received payment may be cause for recomputing the net cost
savings associated with any approved CRP.  The Government reserves
the right to make an adjustment to the Contractor's share of cost
savings and to receive a refund of moneys paid if necessary. 
Such adjustment shall not be made without notifying the Contractor
in advance of the intended action and affording the Contractor
an opportunity for discussion.
<P>
  (g)  <B>Limitations.</B>  Contract requirements that are imposed
by statute shall not be targeted for cost reduction exercises.
 The Contractor is precluded from receiving reimbursements under
both this clause and other incentive provisions of the contract,
if any, for the same cost reductions. 
<P>
  (h)  Disapproval of, or failure to approve, any proposed cost
reduction proposal shall not be considered a dispute subject to
remedies under the Disputes clause.     
<P>
  (i) Cost savings paid to the Contractor in accordance with the
provisions of this clause do not constitute profit or fee within
the limitations imposed by 10 U.S.C. 2306(d) and 41 U.S.C. 254(b).

<B>the</B> <B>Aerospace</B> <B>Program.</B>
<P>
  As prescribed in 1844.170, insert the following clause:
<P>
<B>GEOGRAPHIC PARTICIPATION IN THE</B>
<P>
<B>AEROSPACE PROGRAM</B>
<P>
<B>(APRIL 1985)</B>
<P>
  (a)  It is the policy of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration to advance a broad participation by all geographic
regions in filling the scientific, technical, research and development,
and other needs of the aerospace program.
<P>
  (b)  The Contractor agrees to use its best efforts to solicit
subcontract sources on the broadest feasible geographic basis
consistent with efficient contract performance and without impairment
of program effectiveness or increase in program cost.
<P>
  (c)  The Contractor further agrees  to  insert  this clause
in  all subcontracts of $100,000 and over.
<P>
<B>(End of clause)</B>
<P>
<B>1852.245-70  Acquisition of Centrally</B> <B>Reportable Equipment.</B>
<P>
  As prescribed in 1845.106-70(a), insert the following clause:
<P>
<B>ACQUISITION OF CENTRALLY</B> <B>REPORTABLE EQUIPMENT</B>
<P>
<B>(MARCH 1989)</B>
<P>
  (a)  <B>&quot;Centrally reportable equipment,&quot; </B>was
used in this clause, means plant equipment, special test equipment
(including components), special tooling,  and non-flight space
property (including ground support equipment) (1)  generally commercially
available and used either as a separate item or as a component
of a system, (2) having an acquisition cost of $1,000 or more
(unless a lower threshold is specified elsewhere in this contract),
and (3)  is identifiable by a manufacturer and model number.
<P>
  (b) (1) Before acquiring (including acquiring by fabricating)
any item of centrally reportable equipment under this contract
(unless for incorporation into flight-qualified or flight-monitoring
deliverable end items), the Contractor shall provide to the Contracting
Officer, at the earliest possible date, a description of the item
sufficiently detailed to enable screening of existing Government
inventories.
<P>
     (2)  For this purpose, the Contractor  shall (I) prepare
a separate DD Form 1419, DOD Industrial Plant Equipment Requisition,
for each item of centrally reportable equipment to be acquired
and (ii) forward it through the Contracting Officer to the NASA
Equipment Management System (NEMS) Coordinator at the cognizant
NASA installation at least 30  days in advance of the date the
Contractor intends to acquire or begin fabricating the item. 
If a  certificate of non-availability is not received within that
period, the Contractor may proceed to acquire the item, subject
to any other applicable provisions of this contract.  Instructions
for preparing the DD Form 1419 are contained in NASA FAR Supplement
1845.7103.  The same data may be provided in an alternate format
when requesting other than Defense Industrial Plant Equipment
Center (DIPEC) controlled items.
