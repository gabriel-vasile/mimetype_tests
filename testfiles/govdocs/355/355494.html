        <p> WASHINGTON -  U.S. Sen. Sam Brownback made the following comments after the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced the award of over $19 million to the State of Kansas to enhance the capabilities of the state and local first responder groups.   						  "I am pleased with this significant level of funding for Kansas," Brownback said.  "This will help better equip our state's first responders to provide essential services in the case of an emergency.  This funding is a sign of the Administration's commitment to those who serve on the front lines of our nation's domestic response force."    <P>
On June 5, the Department of Homeland Security announced a $19,603,000 award to the State of Kansas for equipment, training, planning and exercises for first responders.  In addition, a portion of the funds is available to help offset the costs associated with enhanced security measures deployed under the heightened threat period during the conflict in Iraq. <P>
