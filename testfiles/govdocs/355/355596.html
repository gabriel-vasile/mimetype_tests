        terms of the original &quot;global&quot; settlement
        approved by this court on September 1, 1994, various
        benefits were to be provided, in exchange for a release
        of claims, to persons (domestic and foreign) who had
        received breast implants from most U.S.-based
        manufacturers and who had not opted out of the <u>Lindsey</u>
        class. Foreign implant-recipients were offered more
        limited benefits than domestic members of the <u>Lindsey</u>
        class, but were also provided additional opt-out rights,
        as well as some opportunities to pursue breast-implant
        claims in the administrative and judicial tribunals of
        their own countries. To participate in this settlement,
        foreign claimants had to register with the Claims Office
        by March 1, 1995--and, to be treated as &quot;Current
        Claimants,&quot; they had to register by September 16,
        1994, and by December 1, 1994, they had to mail
        substantially complete claim forms and supporting medical
        documentation. Because of litigation pending in Australia
        and in the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec,
        implant-recipients residing in those locations were
        eligible to participate in the settlement in this court
        only if they affirmatively &quot;opted in&quot; to the <u>Lindsey</u>
        class by filing a Registration Form with the Claims
        Office by March 1, 1995.</font></td>

        bankruptcy of Dow Corning, it would not be possible to
        make payments under the announced terms of the
        &quot;global&quot; settlement, and that, accordingly,
        class members should be provided a second right to opt
        out of the <u>Lindsey</u> class, as the earlier notice

        participate in a Revised Settlement Program
        (&quot;RSP&quot;) offered to persons who had received
        Bristol, Baxter, 3M, or McGhan implants. However, the RSP
        was offered at that time only to domestic recipients of
        implants from those companies. To eliminate any need for
        ineligible Foreign Registrants to make the opt-out
        decision prematurely, they were allowed to remain in the
        class (and continue to receive protection from the
        running of statutes of limitations) or to opt out at any
        time within 45 days after being sent a Notification of

        Bristol, Baxter, or 3M breast implants would be offered
        an opportunity to participate in a foreign settlement
        program--provided they had registered by the March 1,

        requirements under the FSP and advising that, if

        Office in order to be placed on the mailing list when the
        detailed terms of the FSP (this Notice) were finally
        developed. After consultation with the Foreign Claimants
        Committee, the court determined that the provisions of
        paragraph 8 below provide the most economical,
        expeditious, and equitable manner of dividing and
        distributing the amounts to be contributed by the
        settling defendants with respect to participating foreign

        basis to eligible Foreign Claimants who have received
        breast implants from any of the three Settling Defendants
        (Bristol, Baxter, and 3M). Rather than the Settling
        Defendants offering to make a prescribed payment into a
        settlement fund that then would be divided in some manner
        among participating class members, the amounts to be paid
        to individual eligible participants are essentially
        unconditional, fixed, and unaffected by the number or
        amount of benefits paid to other participants, and the
        total amount to be paid by the Settling Defendants will
        be determined by the number of, and the payments to, the
        persons participating in the settlement. Benefits payable
        under the Program depend upon whether the person is
        classified as a &quot;Current Claimant&quot; or an
        &quot;Other Registrant.&quot;</font></td>

        Order No. 13 was entered in CV92-P-10000-S in July 1993
        in order to provide for the fair and equitable sharing
        among breast-implant recipients who presented claims in

        performed, and expenses incurred, by attorneys acting for
        the &quot;common benefit&quot; of all such claimants.
        Services in conducting common discovery, for example,
        would be beneficial not only to implant recipients who
        later chose to pursue litigation, but also to those who
        later accepted a settlement offer prompted at least in
        part by the existence of such discovery. As a means for
        complying with Order No. 13, the Settling Defendants
        under this Program will pay into the
        previously-established fund an amount equal to 4% of the

        that the document (or translated portion thereof) has
        been correctly translated, and that the translator has no
        personal or business relationship with the claimant or
        her attorney. Medical and hospital records relating to
        implantation surgery and offered only to prove the
        manufacturer of an implant (and not to support a claim
        under paragraph 7(c)) do not have to be translated into
        English if--without any translation--the Claims Office
        can determine that acceptable proof of manufacturer under
        rules 1-4 or 6-11 on Exhibit G2 has been filed.</font></td>
