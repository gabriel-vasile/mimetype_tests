      <h2><font face="Arial" size="3">Abstract</font></h2>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Objective:</b> To provide researchers, health care providers,
      patients, and the general public with a responsible assessment of the
      opportunities for and challenges of developing a framework for independent
      research on explanted medical implants. For the purpose of this
      conference, medical implants are defined as devices that have a minimum
      lifespan of three months; that penetrate and have a physiologic
      interaction with living tissue; and that can be retrieved.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Participants:</b> A non-Federal, nonadvocate, 14-member panel
      representing the fields of health policy, engineering, internal medicine,
      materials science, cardiology, pathology, law, theology, pharmacy,
      statistics, women's health and the public. In addition, 31 experts from
      these same fields presented data to the panel and a conference audience of
      215.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Evidence:</b> The literature was searched through Medline, and an
      extensive bibliography of references was provided to the panel and the
      conference audience. Experts prepared abstracts with relevant citations
      from the literature. Scientific evidence was given precedence over
      clinical anecdotal experience.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Consensus Process:</b> The panel, answering predefined questions,
      developed their conclusions based on the scientific evidence presented in
      open forum and the scientific literature. The panel composed a draft
      statement, which was read in its entirety and circulated to the experts
      and the audience for comment. Thereafter, the panel resolved conflicting
      recommendations and released a revised statement at the end of the
      conference. The panel finalized the revisions within a few weeks after the
      conference. The draft statement was made available on the World Wide Web
      immediately following its release at the conference and was updated with
      the panel's final revisions. </SEC>

      <h2><font face="Arial" size="3">Introduction</font></h2>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Medical implant devices (MIDs) have been used widely for more than 40
      years, and it is estimated that 8 percent to 10 percent of Americans
      (20-25 million people) currently have such a device. Although implant
      devices have produced great benefits, it must be recognized that all MIDs
      are subject to failure. They are in a continual state of development to
      improve their performance and extend their useful lifespan. Long-term data
      on the behavior of implanted devices and host response are essential
      inputs to the development process, yet there are no systematic programs
      for the retrieval and analysis of implants in this country. Independent
      data banks do exist. The contributions to implant design provided by
      retrieval and analysis will benefit patients through improvements in
      implant performance.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">For the purpose of this conference, implants are defined as having a
      minimum lifespan of 3 months, as penetrating living tissue, as having a
      physiologic interaction, and as being retrievable.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">A number of barriers exist to the establishment of an implant retrieval
      program. Major impediments are the costs associated with such a program
      and the fear of litigation affecting manufacturers, hospitals, physicians,
      and investigators.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">This conference is therefore timely and important. The panel addressed
      the following key questions:</font>
      <ol type="1">
        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">What are the patient, health care provider, and societal
          expectations of the lifetime costs, risks, and benefits of medical
          implants?</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">What are the legal, ethical, religious, cultural, public policy, and
          economic barriers to implant retrieval and reporting, and how can they
          be overcome?</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">What information is necessary to evaluate and improve implant and
          material performance and device design?</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">What can the role of information data systems be in educating the
          public, medical community, and policymakers about medical implants and
          retrieval?</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">What future research and institutional support is necessary to
          ensure continuing advances in implantable devices?</font></li>
      </ol>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Responses to these questions by an independent, non-Federal technology
      assessment panel are based on the study of pertinent written material from
      the medical/scientific literature and on 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>
      days of presentations by experts and audience discussion.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The primary sponsors of this conference were the National Heart, Lung,
      and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and the NIH Office of Medical Applications of
      Research (OMAR). Additional sponsors were the NIH Biomaterials and Medical
      Implant Science Coordinating Committee (which represents all of the NIH
      Institutes and Centers), the National Institute of Arthritis and
      Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, the National Institute of Dental and
      Craniofacial Research, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders
      and Stroke, the National Library of Medicine, and the National Institute
      of Standards and Technology. </SEC>
      <NOHSTAT>
      </font>
      <h2><font face="Arial" size="3">1. What are the patient,
      health care provider, and societal expectations of the lifetime costs,
      risks, and benefits of medical implants?</font></h2>
      <p><b><font face="Arial" size="3">Costs</font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The type or presence of health insurance and coverage provided likely
      modifies patient expectations of costs of implants. For life-saving
      devices that are not experimental or newly introduced, a patient should
      expect insurance coverage. Patient expectations of implant costs should
      include medications needed, if any, as well as coverage for explantation
      or revision, if necessary. Patients should not have to encounter
      unanticipated costs of revision, complications, or prescription drugs.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Health care provider expectations of the costs of medical implants are
      difficult to assess because many health care providers are insulated from
      costs of devices. However, hospitals or health care organizations may
      restrict the use of devices to certain manufacturers in order to contain
      costs, and physicians may feel constrained to choose less expensive
      devices if reimbursements are constant for the operative procedure.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Societal expectations of the costs of medical implants should conform
      to those of similar or alternative treatments, if available, and should
      factor in benefits provided by the implant, including recipients'
      increased productivity.</font>
      <p><b><font face="Arial" size="3">Benefits</font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Although quite variable, patient expectations of the benefits of
      medical implants are often unduly high, for a variety of reasons.
      Information presented to patients may be poorly understood, misleading, or
      inadequate. Expectations of medical implants vary according to the type of
      implant. Although there are gray areas and exceptions in individual cases,
      implants can be broadly categorized as form enhancing, life enhancing, or
      life saving. Expectations of the benefits of life-saving implants may be
      unduly high; for example, patients' perceptions of the benefits of
      artificial hearts and ventricular assist devices appear to exceed those of
      alternative therapies such as cardiac allografts (transplants). In
      general, patient expectations of life-enhancing or life-saving devices
      include survival, restoration of active lifestyle (function, quality of
      life, pain relief), gainful employment, and access to replacing the
      implant if necessary. The last expectation would also apply to
      form-enhancing implants.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Health care provider expectations of the benefits of medical implants
      are, and should be, similar to those of the patient. However, the
      patient's evaluation of the performance of an implant is different from
      that of the physician. For example, a patient may be satisfied by a hip
      replacement because of resolution of pain and enhanced range of motion.
      However, the physician may note x-ray abnormalities suggestive of imminent
      failure and not be satisfied. Whereas the patient will expect benefits to
      persist for his or her lifetime, the physician may be satisfied with
      immediate relief of the patient's disorder. Therefore, monitoring of
      implants needs to take into consideration perceptions of both physician
      and patient.</font>
      <p><b><font face="Arial" size="3">Risks</font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">As with the expectations of costs and benefits, expectations of risks
      of implants are greatly affected by the type of implant. For
      life-enhancing and especially form-enhancing implants, patients and
      physicians expect no catastrophic risks. For life-saving devices, patients
      and physicians understand there are risks; expectations are significantly
      affected by pre-operative education and the nature of the informed
      consent. It is also likely that cultural, socioeconomic, and ethnic
      considerations affect expectations of medical implants, but there are few
      data to support this contention. Health care provider expectations of
      risks of medical implants may, as in the case of benefits, be somewhat
      more short term than those of the patient. However, with optimal
      patient-provider communication and informed consent, the expectations of
      the physician and patient should become closer. </SEC>

      <h2><font face="Arial" size="3">2. What are the legal,
      ethical, religious, cultural, public policy, and economic barriers to
      implant retrieval and reporting, and how can they be overcome?</font></h2>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Implant retrieval and analysis is currently conducted on an ad hoc
      basis by implant manufacturers and academic health care institutions. Such
      analyses may provide the best opportunity to understand the long-term
      consequences of implantation and provide input to the evolutionary
      development of future implant technology.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">A number of obstacles inhibit such studies, including limited
      availability of implants, concerns about tort liability, and costs. But
      inasmuch as studies are already being done, it is clear that these
      obstacles are not insurmountable. Why implant retrieval and analysis does
      not occur on a more widespread and routine basis is a matter that requires
      attention.</font>
      <p><b><font face="Arial" size="3">Legal</font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Commentators have identified a number of legal obstacles or
      disincentives to implant retrieval and analysis. First, uncertainties
      exist about who owns an implanted device. As with other questions about
      the bundle of rights protected by property law, a number of parties may
      assert an interest in a device, and the resolution of disputes about
      ownership will depend to some extent on the terms of contractual
      agreements among these parties. Ultimately, however, the issue has less to
      do with ownership, as such, than with custody and control of potentially
      relevant evidence.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">If litigation is pending or reasonably can be anticipated, persons must
      preserve potentially relevant evidence so that parties not in possession
      may view it and, subject to court-ordered restrictions, engage in
      destructive testing. Even if litigation is not pending, entities in
      possession of an explant may avoid engaging in retrieval analysis because
      of fear of the prospect of subsequent litigation and charges of
      intentional destruction of evidence. The possibility of future litigation
      may also discourage attempts to retrieve devices in the first place.
      Because of the inapplicability of the &quot;self-critical analysis&quot;
      privilege, potential defendants will hesitate to generate internal
      documentation of implant performance that plaintiffs may then request
      during discovery and introduce as evidence. Finally, independent
      researchers may hesitate to undertake implant retrieval and analysis
      either because litigants may subpoena their work or manufacturers may
      threaten product disparagement lawsuits if unflattering results are
      published.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Several commentators have asserted that tort litigation stifles
      technological innovation and continues to cause unavailability of certain
      raw materials, and it may well create disincentives to more widespread
      implant retrieval and analysis. This subject deserves further research and
      possibly legislative attention. Notwithstanding the potential enormity of
      such an undertaking, health care practitioners and researchers have an
      important opportunity to influence some of these legal disincentives by
      defining the standard of care in a manner that may facilitate medical
      device research and improvement. Health care professionals already have an
      ethical obligation to report adverse events and device malfunctions, and
      explanting surgeons and facilities at least should not inhibit efforts at
      retrieval analysis.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Finally, regulatory requirements may impede or discourage implant
      retrieval and analysis. Although the FDA could mandate that manufacturers
      conduct such research as a condition of premarket approval or as an
      element of a postmarket surveillance order, it has exercised such
      authority only rarely. The FDA's quality system and medical device
      reporting requirements may negatively influence manufacturers' decisions
      about whether to conduct such research voluntarily. If reported to the
      FDA, manufacturers may fear that proprietary retrieval information may be
      disclosed to the public if it does not qualify as trade secret or
      confidential commercial data. On the other hand, the expansion of Federal
      and State privacy protections makes it difficult for independent
      researchers to link information about retrieved devices to the health
      records of patients.</font>
      <p><b><font face="Arial" size="3">Religious</font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Among Roman Catholics, mainstream Protestants, and Orthodox Christians,
      there are no magisterial or in principle objections to retrieval of
      medical devices from living or dead human bodies for purposes of analysis
      and assessment. However, some Christian sects strenuously oppose any
      mutilation of the body, either before or after death. If pre- or
      post-mortem retrieval procedures are done in a timely manner (i.e.,
      anticipating a prompt burial) and if the wound is sutured and the corpse
      treated with respect as though it were a living patient, liberal
      Jews-mostly Reform, Reconstructionist, and Conservative-have no objection
      on the principle of &quot;pikkuah nefesh,&quot; the obligation to save
      life or lives. Such an act is a &quot;mitzvah.&quot; Some Orthodox Jews
      and traditionalists, as a non-negotiable halachic norm, object to any
      mutilation of a corpse, including autopsy and embalming. Other religious
      groups have similar diversity of opinion.</font>
      <p><b><font face="Arial" size="3">Economic</font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">There are clear and impressive economic barriers to retrieval of
      devices for analysis and assessment. Not least among these are costs
      associated with the project itself, and despite cost variables for
      different devices, financing is problematic.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Academic health care institutions' submissions of study proposals to
      funding agencies are not typically funded. Joint industry-academic efforts
      have been undertaken, but these are the exception rather than the rule.
      The ability of manufacturers to conduct their own studies relates directly
      to their size and in-house capability; the reality is that most of the
      medical device industry consists of small entrepreneurial companies
      without such a capability. There currently exists no industrywide
      &quot;superfund&quot; to support implant retrieval and analysis, but even
      if it were feasible to establish such a fund, these monies would not
      likely be sufficient to secure retrieval and analysis of every implanted
      device.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Likewise, funding for implant registries is difficult to obtain and
      sustain. Institutions and professional societies have supported limited
      patient registries/databases, and manufacturers have established patient
      registries both voluntarily and when asked or ordered to do so by
      regulatory agencies. Moreover, third-party registries have been attempted.
      Provisioning a universal data bank-with components for tracking and
      adequate representation of device and patient experience over time-appears
      to be prohibitively expensive at this time.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Analysis and assessment of medical implants currently poses significant
      liability risks for physicians and hospitals as well as manufacturers, and
      fear of costly litigation is a major barrier to retrieval. Exemption of
      some life-saving devices, as innovative or experimental therapies, from
      risk of liability would diminish that anxiety. Further, a publicly funded
      shared cost-charged, for example, in part to basic research and in part to
      applied technology-could facilitate a retrieval and analysis project. We
      need to understand why, in other sectors, technology reduces cost and
      increases market availability.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Economic factors can result in a lack of accessibility to some
      high-tech tertiary interventions by substantial segments of American
      citizens, particularly the poor and ethnic minorities. As a result, the
      findings from an implant retrieval and analysis program may not be
      applicable to underrepresented groups.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">There is a strong sense that academic health care institutions would
      conduct more and varied studies, either alone or in concert with Federal
      laboratories and/or manufacturers, were funding available. A continuation
      of an ad hoc approach, however, is not a viable means to meet the need for
      a coordinated implant retrieval and analysis system. Not only is funding
      needed, but that funding should be managed as part of an NIH/FDA joint
      program to develop uniform functional, quality-of-life, and analytical
      measures that would ensure intercomparability and sharing of data. Such an
      effort should also be in harmony with efforts globally.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">An unexplored opportunity for funding is the third-party payer. As
      health maintenance organizations and other payers strive to contain costs
      while ensuring quality of health care, it becomes critical to conduct
      outcomes research. Implant retrieval and analysis, when coupled with
      information on the health status of patients at the time of explant,
      offers an opportunity to gather data in support of the cost-effectiveness
      of various implant technologies. The availability of chips that can
      monitor device performance, in ways similar to an airplane's &quot;black
      box,&quot; suggests the possibility of obtaining implant performance data
      at a feasible cost.</SEC>

      device design?</font></h2>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Technology progresses by facing its failures and learning from its
      successes. The goal of device research and development is to improve
      patient care through improvement of implants. A fundamental objective is
      to understand successful implants and assess failures through retrieval
      analysis. In addition, monitoring device performance in vivo may permit
      early corrective therapy. Explants will require specific analysis by
      qualified laboratories using appropriate protocols.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The information required to evaluate and improve implants is a
      combination of clinical data and device retrieval analysis.</font>
      <p><b><font face="Arial" size="3">At the Time of Implantation</font></b></p>

      according to protocols, based on existing American Society for Testing and
      Materials (ASTM) and International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
      standards, where applicable, including biocompatability as judged by local

      <h2><font face="Arial" size="3">4. What can the role of
      information data systems be in educating the public, medical community,
      and policymakers about medical implants and retrieval?</font></h2>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Many people understand that MIDs provide improvements in quality of
      life for their recipients. Less widely recognized is the importance of the
      retrieval and analysis of a medical implant when it has failed or when it
      is no longer useful. Information gained from such retrieval and analysis
      provides insight into the strengths and weaknesses of the design of the
      device and enables improvement in future product design. Moreover, for
      those devices that have serious design flaws, retrieval and examination
      can yield insight into how to monitor patients who currently have the
      implanted device.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Education about retrieval and analysis for the various constituencies
      should take different forms because the needs of the constituencies
      differ. Patients and families must understand the purpose of retrieval to
      motivate their willingness to allow retrieval and analysis of the device.
      Policymakers must learn about retrieval to help them formulate wise
      policy. The medical community, that is, practitioners, administrators, and
      medical societies, should be able to use education about retrieval to help
      them treat current and future patients more effectively. Finally, device
      manufacturers will find the information gained from the study of explanted
      devices useful in the improvement of the next generation of devices.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Patients need to understand their disease and the options they have in
      choosing whether to have an implantable device. To make informed choices,
      patients must receive interpretable information that will allow them to
      develop reasonable expectations about the immediate, short-term, and
      long-term risks, the functional benefits arising from the device, and the
      lifespan of the device. The process allowing a patient to give a truly
      informed consent should be complete and clear. A primer describing the
      function of the device and possible failure modes will help patients
      understand the experience they are about to undergo. Finally, part of the
      educational process should be an explanation of retrieval of the product
      if it fails or if the patient dies before it fails. A fully informed
      patient who appreciates the benefits and risks of the device may be more
      willing to allow retrieval than a person who has unreasonably optimistic
      expectations about lifelong success.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Policymakers must have all the information given to patients, as well
      as other data. They must understand that innovation is complex. They must
      appreciate the importance of analysis of explants, the economic impact of
      systems of retrieval and analysis, and the barriers to retrieval and
      analysis. Detailed, specific case histories of past failures of devices
      will help them understand how to establish policy.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The medical community should have all the information given to patients
      and policymakers, but they need still more information. Specifically,
      practicing physicians must decide which of the competing devices to use in
      a specific patient. To make that decision, they need comparative
      information about device models. Data on performance, with appropriate
      denominators, should help inform their choices. An educational program for
      physicians should stress that part of the standard of care should include
      retrieval of devices and return of retrieved devices to a laboratory along
      with the relevant medical history of the patient from whom the device was
      retrieved. A Web-based collaborative support system could facilitate and
      promote multi-site collaborative research and analysis.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Manufacturers, in their quest for improved devices, should have all the
      information available to the other stakeholders, in addition to their own
      proprietary information.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">An effective educational program should be multifaceted. Books and
      pamphlets, brochures, packet inserts, and videos all should be available,
      each written at a level of sophistication appropriate to the audience for
      which it is designed.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">In addition, a Web-based educational forum would allow rapid access to
      relevant data. The Web has a number of excellent medical sites with
      scientifically up-to-date information accessible both to professionals and
      the lay public. A Web site dealing with devices, modeled on one of these,
      would provide useful information. The portal page should have five themes.
      First, it should have a link to a section that educates the user about the
      fact that things in general eventually fail. This introduction should
      serve as a reminder that any medical device has a finite life. Second, it
      should link to a discussion of risk. This section should help patients
      understand how to assess the level of risk they personally are willing to
      assume. Third, it should link to a discussion of informed consent. Fourth,
      it should link to a section that describes the importance of retrieval and
      analysis. This part of the Web site should point out that the altruism of
      previous recipients of devices has contributed to the development of
      currently available devices, and it should encourage implant recipients to
      think about allowing retrieval when their devices are no longer of use to
      them.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The fifth and most extensive part of the portal page should be a set of
      links to more specialized Web sites that contain information about
      specific devices. The lay user will choose a body part (for example, a
      hip, an eye, a knee), which will link to a page containing all the
      patient-relevant information described earlier (for example, descriptions
      of the disease, the devices, and their lifespans). This page will also
      link to other relevant sites. Professional users may select by body
      system; their choices will include Web sites with more technical
      information.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Maintaining and updating the Web site will require considerable effort.
      The group responsible for the main site will need to provide critical
      appraisals of the linked sites so that the user will not be misled by raw
      data and biased selection. Cooperation between the FDA and NIH on
      developing and maintaining the Web site would be ideal.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Finally, an ongoing educational program should include support groups
      (both real and virtual), computer chat rooms, and list servers that allow
      patients and professionals to learn about the various devices.</SEC>

      implantable devices?</font></h2>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The NIH should develop an aggressive research and development program
      on sensors and other telemetry devices for early detection of potential
      problems.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The NIH has an exceptional opportunity to improve the care of patients
      with implants by providing support for state-of-the-art core laboratories
      for analysis of retrieved implants. This analysis would be done in full
      collaboration with and through participation of the medical specialty
      societies and medical device industry, which should identify areas of need
      for basic bioengineering analysis of implants.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">For new or significantly altered MIDs, studies should be funded
      competitively by the NIH to follow recipients regularly for a prolonged
      time in order to collect data on clinical and implant function and patient
      satisfaction. Sampling methods should be used to ensure valid
      epidemiologic inference where appropriate. Persons admitted to the study
      should be required to permit retrieval of the implant when it is no longer
      of value.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">An independent body commissioned by the NIH and FDA should examine
      current databases on devices for their completeness and their use in
      improving MIDs.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The field of medical implants is entering the exciting new phase of
      tissue engineering. The U.S. Government should prepare and plan to
      construct the regulatory protocols required by the nature of this new
      class of implants. For tissue engineered products, where there will be no
      implant to retrieve, alternate means of analysis of failures and successes
      need to be developed.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Medical societies should strive to educate their members about the
      importance of the informed consent process to medical device implantation.
      Informed consent documents should educate the patient before surgery
      regarding benefits, risks, potential complications, expected longevity of
      the device, need for follow-up, and possible future examination of the
      implant. The patient should be provided with copies of the informed
      consent document.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The NIH should sponsor technology assessment conferences on selected
      MIDs to assist patients, providers, and society in evaluating the clinical
      and economic outcomes associated with their use. The NIH also should fund
      multicenter studies with longer-term outcomes than those associated with
      pre-market approval. These studies should include relevant basic science
      aspects. Existing databases should be coordinated with each other and
      their funding continued.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Subspecialty medical societies should be involved in public education
      about devices, collaboration with the FDA, and dissemination of
      information to pathology laboratories and medical examiner's offices
      regarding the mechanism of forwarding the devices to the core
      laboratories.</SEC>

      <h2><font face="Arial" size="3">Conclusions</font></h2>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Implant retrieval and analysis is of critical importance in the process
      of improving care of patients in need of implants.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Attention needs to be directed toward reducing various obstacles to
      implant retrieval and analysis, particularly legal and economic
      disincentives.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Society's and patients' expectations of the risks and benefits of
      medical implants are often unrealistic, especially as to the lifespan of
      the implant. An inadequate process for allowing patients to give truly
      informed consent is a significant source of patients' dissatisfaction with
      the outcome of implant procedures. Patients' dissatisfaction with the
      informed consent process may adversely affect their willingness to consent
      to implant retrieval and analysis.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The failure to appreciate the value of MID retrieval and analysis is a
      serious impediment to medical device research. A focused educational
      program aimed at obtaining patients' consent to medical implant retrieval

      <h2><font face="Arial" size="3">Recommendations</font></h2>
      <ol type="1">
        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">The NIH and FDA should sponsor a consensus development conference on
          the relationship between (and possible adverse effects of) litigation
          and medical innovation. A goal of this proposed conference would be to
          determine mechanisms for mitigating the effects of litigation on
          medical innovation.</font>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">Patients should be provided with a card containing information about
          their implant(s), including date of implantation, make, model, and
          serial number. The card should also serve as an implant
          &quot;donor&quot; consent form, analogous to an organ donor card, to
          simplify post-mortem retrieval.</font>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">The NIH and the FDA should be encouraged to develop an aggressive
          educational program for teaching patients, policymakers, the medical
          community, and device manufacturers about the importance of device
          retrieval and analysis. To support this activity, the NIH and the FDA
          should develop a Web site that links to databases of devices.</font>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">The medical device industry should build on their existing strengths
          to enhance the process of implant retrieval and analysis by sharing
          information regarding adverse experiences with interested parties.</font>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">Encourage national medical societies and other organizations to meet
          regularly to discuss medical device issues of mutual concern. The
          Orthopaedic Device Forum, a group comprised of representatives of the
          clinical and scientific orthopaedic community, orthopaedic industry,
          government agencies, and professional societies, provides a useful
          model for fostering device-specific communication among clinicians,
          scientists, government, and industry.</font>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">The NIH should support training programs designed to develop
          expertise in analysis of retrieved MIDs.</font>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">Health care practitioners and researchers should define a standard
          of care in medical implant retrieval and analysis to moderate some of
          the legal system's disincentives.</font>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">Tissue engineering technologies are beginning to be applied to the
          development of medical implant devices. The U.S. Government should
          begin active preparation and planning to construct the regulatory
          protocols that this new class of implants likely will require.</font></li>
