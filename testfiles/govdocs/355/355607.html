In the former, <i>X. laevis<b>         </b></i>has led the way in establishing the mechanisms of early fate decisions,         patterning of the basic body plan, and organogenesis. Contributions in         cell biology and biochemistry include seminal work on chromosome replication,         chromatin and nuclear assembly, cell cycle components, cytoskeletal elements,         and signaling pathways. Information amassed from these studies provides         a strong underpinning for future work, and, although <i>X. laevis</i>         is superb for characterizing the activities of particular genes, only         a tiny fraction have as yet been assayed. A major goal now is to examine         the expressed genome in the context of the biological phenomena mentioned         above using genomic technology, specifically ESTs and full-length cDNA         libraries.</font></font></p>      <font face="Times">       <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">In recent years, <i>Xenopus         tropicalis</i> has emerged as a complementary system in which to combine         genetic approaches with the established strengths of the <i>X. laevis</i><B><i>         </i></B>system. New strategies will be feasible when genetic variants         are examined in an embryological context, e.g. by making genetic chimeras,         and generation of stable transgenic reporter lines in the short-generation         <i>X. tropicalis</i><b> </b>will increase the feasibility of many embryological         assays. Since the degree of sequence similarity and functional interchangeability         is high,<i> X. tropicalis</i><b> </b>studies will also benefit from the         <i>X. laevis</i> EST and cDNA cloning experiments. </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">In preparation for         this workshop, the opinions of the <i>Xenopus</i> community were canvassed         and the proposals below are based on this information together with discussions         at this workshop.&#9;</font></p>      <ul>        <li>          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>EST Database.             </b>The highest priority, one which is ready to be undertaken immediately,             is the generation of an <i>X. laevis</i> EST database that should             consist of 500,000 clones (estimated to be at least half of the expressed             sequence complexity). Initially this should capitalize on existing             cDNA libraries and should be complemented with normalized libraries             from selected stages. A small EST database in <i>X. tropicalis</i>             (50,000 clones) will provide a beginning for genomic research in this             organism. Estimated cost: $5,500,000 over two years.</font></p>        </li>        <li>          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Full length             cDNA Sequences. </b>Full length sequenced, unique cDNAs from <i>X.             laevis</i> eggs and embryos are needed for functional studies (e.g.             expression cloning strategies). Estimated cost for preparation, sequencing             and arraying 50,000 full length cDNAs is $15,000,000 over three years.</font></p>        </li>        <li>          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Microarrays.             </b> This rapidly evolving technology promises major advances. The             utility of <i>Xenopus</i> for developmental studies, e.g. explantation,             induction, and overexpression assays, make array technology especially             valuable in this system. Array technology will become applicable as             EST/cDNA sequences come on line. Therefore, funding to produce and             make available <i>Xenopus</i> chips to the community should begin             one year after EST/cDNA sequencing is initiated.

The expanded database should encompass the existing data,             more comprehensive information concerning gene expression patterns,             additional fate maps and anatomical atlases of embryonic stages, and             information generated from the EST database and cDNA libraries. Sequences             should be organized along the lines of databases for other organisms             so that data is easily retrievable. Initial requirements include computational             facilities and a skilled data manager; as the sequence database matures,             a bioinformatics professional will become essential.
