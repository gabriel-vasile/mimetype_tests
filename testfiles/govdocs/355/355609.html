      <h2><a name="Purpose"></a>Purpose</h2>
      <p>The purpose of radioactive seed localization (RSL) of non-palpable lesions<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> is to localize suspicious tissues for excision with the use of radioactive seeds.  RSL differs from current localization procedures, whereby a non-radioactive wire is implanted into the lesion site and excised along with the affected tissue.  The RSL technique offers advantages over the wire implantation technique for localizing lesions. For example, with the use of RSL, the bracketing of lesions and the post-localization of mammograms is not impeded by wires, and RSL can be performed up to 5 days before surgery, minimizing schedule conflicts.</p>
      <p>RSL uses radioactive seeds previously approved for the treatment of cancerous tumors.  For instance, typically, iodine-125 and palladium-103 seeds<sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup> between 200 &ndash; 300 &mu;Ci/seed are implanted into a breast lesion using a standard 18-gauge needle.  These seeds are normally implanted within mammography or ultrasound suites and removed within surgical suites between 2 and 5 days post implantation.  The radioactive seed(s) can be easily located with appropriate instrumentation (using a technique with which surgeons are familiar because of its similarity to sentinel lymph node biopsy and radioguided parathyroidectomy) and surgically removed with minimal injury to non-affected tissue.  The seed(s) may be removed from the tissue specimen in surgery, or the tissue specimen containing the seed(s) can be sent to pathology for removal of the seed and analysis of the tissue.  The seed or seeds are then disposed of in accordance with 10 CFR 35.92 or the equivalent Agreement State regulations.</p>
      <p><sup><a name="fn1">1</a></sup>An area of suspicious tissue detected by mammography that needs further evaluation.<br>
        <sup><a name="fn2" id="fn2">2</a></sup>Multiple seeds may be used to define irregularly shaped lesions.</p>

      <h2>Licensing Guidance</h2>
      <p>The use of these iodine-125 and palladium-103 seeds for therapy is currently regulated under 10 CFR 35.400: &ldquo;Use of sources for manual brachytherapy&rdquo; and the equivalent Agreement State regulations.  In the RSL procedure, the iodine-125 or palladium-103 seeds are implanted for localization by an authorized user and are not intended to deliver a therapeutic dose to tissue.  Therefore, this application is not regulated under 10 CFR 35.400 or the equivalent Agreement State regulation.  The use of these seeds for RSL procedures will be regulated under 10 CFR 35.1000: &ldquo;Other medical uses&rdquo; and the equivalent Agreement State regulations.</p>
      <p>This guidance is intended to address situations where the physical locations of implant, excision, and recovery of these seed(s) are all authorized by the same radioactive materials license.</p>
      <p>If the licensee intends to transfer the radioactive tissue samples, i.e., the tissues will still contain the seed(s), or more than 1 microcurie of iodine-125 or 100 microcuries of palladium-103 contamination from a leaking source, to an outside pathology laboratory, the licensee must ensure before shipment that the samples will be transferred to an NRC or Agreement State licensed laboratory authorized to receive the seeds or radioactive contaminated tissue (10 CFR 30.41).  The applicant must also ensure that packages will be properly prepared in accordance with 10 CFR 71.5 or an equivalent Agreement State regulation for shipping.      </p>
      <p>This guidance represents an acceptable means to the NRC and Agreement State staff of complying with regulations to apply for RSL and is not intended to be the only means of satisfying requirements for a license.  Therefore, to meet the requirements of 10 CFR 30.33 and 10 CFR 35.12 or the equivalent Agreement State regulations, the applicant must provide the information requested below or may, unless the information is specifically required by regulation, submit alternative commitments for review by the NRC or Agreement State staff to determine whether they meet regulatory requirements.  In addition, the commitments contained therein will be reviewed during routine inspections.</p>
      <p>Applicants are reminded that licenses issued pursuant to 10 CFR 35.1000 or the equivalent Agreement State regulation, must still meet the general requirements in 10 CFR Part 35 or the equivalent Agreement State regulations (e.g., applicable section of Subparts A, B, C, L, and M).  For example, 10 CFR 35.67, or the equivalent Agreement State regulation, contains requirements for leak testing sealed sources, 10 CFR 35.75, or the equivalent Agreement State regulation, contains provisions for release of patients containing implants, and 10 CFR 35.3045, or the equivalent Agreement State regulation, contains requirements for reporting medical events.</p>

      <h2>General</h2>
      <p><strong>Radionuclides, Form, Possession Limits, and Purpose of Use:</strong></p>
      <p>Identify the radionuclides, chemical/physical form, maximum possession limit, and purpose of use.  For example, the following provides the format for an acceptable request:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong> Radionuclides, Form, Possession Limits</strong></p>
        <p> Authorization 6: Iodine-125 or Palladium-103<br>
          Authorization 7: Sealed sources (manufacturer and model number)<br>
          Authorization 8: 1.5 millicuries maximum per treatment and 15 millicuries total;</p>
        <p><strong> Purpose of Use</strong></p>
        <p> Authorization 9: For use as temporary implants to localize non-palpable lesions.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><strong>Facility Address and Description:</strong></p>
      <p>Provide an address of use and submit a facility diagram and description of the location where the radioactive sources will be received, used, and stored.</p>
      <p>If the tissues sent to pathology will still contain the seed(s), or more than 1 microcurie of iodine-125 or 100 microcuries of palladium-103 contamination from a leaking source, the licensee should be aware that pathology is a location where radioactive sources will be received, used, and stored and therefore must be identified as a location of use in the application.</p>
      <p><strong>Authorized Users:</strong></p>
      <p>Identify each authorized user performing seed implants and explants and provide documention of their training and experience in the use of the iodine-125 or palladium-103 seeds for the RSL procedure.

      <h2>Notes to Licensees</h2>
      <p><strong>Survey Instrumentation</strong></p>
      <p>Licensees must have adequate equipment and provide information on equipment calibration.  The licensee should possess and use a properly calibrated  radiation survey instrument.  The survey instrument should be a portable survey instrument which is equipped with a thin crystal sodium iodide (NaI) probe when performing surveys  for RSL procedures involving iodine-125 and palladium-103.  A NaI probe is the most appropriate instrumentation because they are both very low energy gamma emitters and thus are very difficult to detect using a conventional survey instrument.  Applicants must submit a description of the survey instrumentation and calibration for the instruments they will use.</p>
      <p><strong>Emergency Response Equipment</strong></p>
      <p>Licensees must submit information showing it has equipment adequate to protect public health and safety and minimize danger.  In order to demonstrate this, it should submit a description of the equipment to be used in the case of an emergency such as loss or rupture of a seed.  This equipment should include gloves, reverse action tweezers, shielded containers, a low energy gamma scintillation survey instrument, and caution radioactive materials (CRAM) labels.</p>
      <p><strong>Change in Physical Conditions of Use</strong></p>
      <p>Because the conditions of use exceed those reported in the Sealed Source and Device (SSD) certificate due to the sources not having been tested for puncture, the limited specific medical use licensee must request an amendment for the new conditions of use.</p>
      <p>Note that certain states will not allow variations in the conditions of use unless the original SSD certificate is amended or a custom evaluation is performed.  NUREG 1556, Vol. 3, rev. 1, &ldquo;Consolidated Guidance About Materials Licenses: Applications for Sealed Source and Device Evaluation and Registration&rdquo; or equivalent Agreement State guidance documents may be used for custom evaluations.  A broad scope licensee can perform its own engineering and radiation safety evaluation addressing those differences.</p>
      <p>Licensees should submit documentation that addresses the safe use of the source in the normal and emergency conditions associated with this 10 CFR 35.1000, or equivalent Agreement State regulations, use.  This documentation for Agreement States may be, but is not limited to, an engineering, historical, or scientific analysis of the surgical removal of these sources.  NRC will review the licensee&rsquo;s procedures for routine monitoring before, during, and after all source uses and the licensee&rsquo;s emergency procedures to determine if they are adequate to ensure rapid identification and remediation of broken or leaking sources.</p>

      <h2>Suggested Revisions to Existing Iodine-125 and Palladium-103 Seed Localization Programs to Conform to this Licensing Guidance</h2>
      <p>(Note: Requesting authorization in accordance with the following guidance will permit a licensee to make certain changes under 10 CFR 35.26, &ldquo;Radiation protection program changes,&rdquo; or equivalent Agreement State regulations, to the RSL safety program that might otherwise require a license amendment).</p>
      <p>The above licensing guidance may be revised as additional experience is gained regarding medical use of RSL.  A licensee already authorized to use iodine-125 and/or palladium-103 seeds for RSL and committed by license condition to follow the provisions in the guidance existing at the time of commitment must apply for and receive an amendment to its license in order to make changes to conform to the revised provisions.</p>
      <p>An applicant initially applying for authorization for medical use of RSL (or a licensee applying later for an amendment to conform to revisions in this guidance) may request authorization to allow future changes to its radiation safety program, provided the following conditions are met:</p>
      <ul><li>The revision is in compliance with the regulations of the NRC or Agreement State;<br>
          </li>
        <li>The revision is based on the current guidance for RSL 35.1000 use posted on the NRC website;<br>
  </li>
        <li>The revision has been reviewed and approved by the licensee&rsquo;s Radiation Safety Officer and management;<br>
  </li>
        <li>The affected individuals are instructed on the revised program before the change is implemented;<br>
  </li>
        <li>The licensee will retain a record of each change for 5 years; and<br>
  </li>
        <li>The record will include a copy of the appropriate website guidance, the old procedure, the new procedure, the effective date of the change, and the signature of the licensee management that reviewed and approved the change.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If this authorization is approved, these conditions will be incorporated as license conditions in the licensee&rsquo;s license.</p>
      <p>The above guidance for changes to conform to the revised provisions does not prevent Agreement States from requiring the licensee request an amendment for each change to its radiation safety program if that is their policy.</p>
