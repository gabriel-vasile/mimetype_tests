      <h4><font face="Arial" size="3">Conclusions.</font></h4>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Cochlear implantation improves communication ability in most adults
      with severe to profound deafness and frequently leads to positive
      psychological and social benefits as well. Currently, children at least 2
      years old and adults with profound deafness are candidates for
      implantation. Cochlear implant candidacy should be extended to adults with
      severe hearing impairment and open-set sentence discrimination that is
      less than or equal to 30 percent in the best aided condition. Access to
      optimal education and (re)habilitation services is important for adults
      and is critical for children to maximize the benefits available from
      cochlear implantation.</font></p>
      <h2><font face="Arial" size="3">Introduction</font></h2>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Cochlear implants are now firmly established as effective options in
      the habilitation and rehabilitation of individuals with profound hearing
      impairment. Worldwide, more than 12,000 people have attained some degree
      of sound perception with cochlear implants, and the multichannel cochlear
      implant has become a widely accepted auditory prosthesis for both adults
      and children. The vast majority of deaf adults with cochlear implants
      derive substantial benefit when the implant is used in conjunction with
      speech reading. As a result of cochlear implantation, many of these
      individuals are able to understand some speech without speech reading, and
      some are able to communicate by telephone. Benefits have also been
      observed in children, including those who lost their hearing prelingually;
      moreover, there is evidence that the benefits derived improve with
      continued use. New speech-sound processing techniques continue to improve
      the effectiveness of cochlear implants, increasing user performance beyond
      previous levels.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The NIH sponsored a Consensus Development Conference (CDC) on Cochlear
      Implants in 1988. Since then, implant technology has improved
      substantially. Some questions unanswered at that conference have been
      resolved, and new issues have emerged that must be addressed.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">For example, the performance of some severely to profoundly
      hearing-impaired adults using hearing aids is poorer than that of more
      severely hearing-impaired individuals using cochlear implants with
      advanced speech-processing strategies. It is possible that cochlear
      implants could benefit some of these individuals. Therefore, the criteria
      for implantation should be re-examined. The ability to predict
      preoperatively the level of performance at which an individual implant
      recipient will function is highly desirable. Currently, the limited
      prediction of implant efficacy in a specific individual remains a pressing
      problem. Agreement does not exist on the definition of a successful
      implant user. What are the appropriate expectations for individuals using
      cochlear implants? How is benefit defined and measured? What are the
      audiological, educational, and psychosocial impacts of this intervention
      and is it cost-effective? Advancing technology will allow for the
      modification of existing devices or the development of new devices.
      Therefore, it is important to know what risks and benefits are associated
      with device explantation/reimplantation. Surgical and other risks and
      possible long-term effects of cochlear implants require evaluation.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Implantation of individuals with multiple disabilities, the elderly,
      and children, particularly children who are prelingually deaf, engenders
      special questions. Longitudinal studies are providing information on the
      development of auditory speech perception and production and language
      skills in deaf children with a cochlear implant. What educational setting
      is best for the development of speech and language in these children? Are
      cochlear implants efficacious in children who are prelingually deaf?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">To address the issues that have arisen since the 1988 CDC on Cochlear
      Implants, the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication
      Disorders, together with the NIH Office of Medical Applications of
      Research, convened a CDC on Cochlear Implants in Adults and Children, May
      15-17, 1995. The conference was cosponsored by the National Institute on
      Aging, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the
      National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, and the
      Department of Veterans Affairs.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The conference was convened to summarize current knowledge about the
      range of benefits and limitations of cochlear implantation that have
      accrued to date. Such knowledge is an important basis for informed choices
      for individuals and their families whose philosophy of communication is
      dedicated to spoken discourse. Issues related to the acquisition of sign
      language were not directly addressed by the panel, because the focus of
      the conference was on new information on cochlear implant technology and
      its use. The panel acknowledges the value and contributions of bilingual
      and bicultural approaches to deafness.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">This conference brought together specialists in auditory anatomy and
      physiology, otolaryngology, audiology, aural rehabilitation, education,
      speech-language pathology, bioengineering, and other related disciplines
      as well as representatives from the public. After 1-1/2 days of
      presentations and audience discussion, an independent, non-Federal
      consensus panel weighed the scientific evidence and developed a statement
      that addressed the following five questions:</font></p>

        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">What Factors Affect the Auditory Performance of Cochlear Implant
          Recipients?</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">What Are the Benefits and Limitations of Cochlear Implantation?</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">What Are the Technical and Safety Considerations of Cochlear

          Implantation?</font></li>
      </ul>
      <font face="Arial" size="3"><b>1. What Factors Affect the
      Auditory Performance of Cochlear Implant Recipients?</b><SS1>
      </font>
      <h4><font face="Arial" size="3">Subject Factors</font></h4>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Auditory performance, defined as the ability to detect, discriminate,
      recognize, or identify acoustic signals, including speech, is highly
      variable among individuals using cochlear implants. Since the 1988 CDC on
      Cochlear Implants, however, some factors associated with outcome
      variability are now better understood.</font></p>
      <SS2>
      <h4><font face="Arial" size="3">Etiology</font></h4>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Because of a larger subject sample, the effects of etiology can now be
      distinguished from other factors such as the duration of deafness and the
      age of onset. For example, deafness due to meningitis does not necessarily
      limit the benefit of cochlear implantation in the absence of central
      nervous system complications, cochlear ossification, or cochlear
      occlusion. Children with congenital deafness and children with
      prelingually acquired meningitic deafness, for example, achieve similar
      auditory performance if the cochlear implant is received before age 6. In
      general, etiology does not appear to affect auditory performance in either
      children or adults.</font></p>
      </SS2>
      <SS2>
      <h4><font face="Arial" size="3">Age of Onset of Deafness</font></h4>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The age of onset continues to have important implications for success
      with cochlear implantation, depending on whether the hearing impairment
      occurred before (prelingual), during (perilingual), or after (postlingual)
      learning speech and language. At the last CDC, data on cochlear
      implantation suggested that children or adults with postlingual onset of
      deafness had better auditory performance than children or adults with
      prelingual or perilingual onset. Current data about auditory performance
      in children over longer times support this finding. However, the
      difference between children with postlingual and those with
      prelingual-perilingual onset of deafness appears to lessen with time.
      Large individual differences remain within each group, however.</font></p>
      </SS2>
      <SS2>
      <h4><font face="Arial" size="3">Age at Implantation</font></h4>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Previous data suggested that prelingually or perilingually deafened
      persons who were implanted in adolescence or adulthood did not achieve the
      same level of auditory performance as those implanted during childhood,
      although individual differences were recognized. Current data continue to
      support the importance of early detection of hearing loss and implantation
      for maximal auditory performance. However, it is still unclear whether
      implantation at age 2, for example, ultimately results in better auditory
      performance than implantation at age 3.</font></p>
      </SS2>
      <SS2>
      <h4><font face="Arial" size="3">Duration of Deafness</font></h4>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">As deafness endures, even in postlingually deafened individuals, some
      auditory and linguistic skills may decline and some behavioral traits that
      work against successful adaptation to a sensory device may develop.
      Individuals with shorter durations of auditory deprivation tend to achieve
      better auditory performance from any type of sensory aid, including a
      cochlear implant, than do individuals with longer durations of auditory
      deprivation.</font></p>
      </SS2>
      <SS2>
      <h4><font face="Arial" size="3">Residual Hearing</font></h4>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Initially, cochlear implant use was restricted to persons with profound
      hearing loss (pure-tone threshold average (PTA) of greater than 100 dB HL
      and no open-set speech recognition ability with best-fit hearing aids).
      The average auditory performance of these cochlear-implant users has been
      better than the average auditory performance of hearing-aid users with
      some residual hearing, that is, severe hearing loss (PTA &gt; 90 dB HL)
      and some (&lt;30 percent) open-set speech recognition ability with
      best-fit hearing aids. Recent data show that auditory performance in
      people with residual hearing improves after cochlear implantation relative
      to preoperative auditory performance, although the degree of improvement
      could not be predicted from preoperative hearing sensitivity. Research is
      now addressing the critical distinction between the importance of residual
      hearing sensitivity compared with overall residual auditory capacities and
      functional communicative status.</font></p>
      </SS2>
      </SS1>
      <SS1>
      <h4><font face="Arial" size="3">Electrophysiological Factors</font></h4>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Some surviving spiral ganglion cells are necessary for auditory
      performance with a cochlear implant. Degenerative changes occur in both
      ganglion cells and central auditory neurons following sensorineural
      deafening. Although a relationship between the number of surviving
      ganglion cells and psychophysical performance has been demonstrated in
      animals, a direct relationship between ganglion cell survival and level of
      auditory performance in humans has not been shown. Animal studies also
      suggest that electrical stimulation increases ganglion cell survival and
      also modifies the functional organization of the central auditory system.
      The implications of these new findings for humans remain to be determined.</font></p>
      </SS1>
      <SS1>
      <h4><font face="Arial" size="3">Device Factors</font></h4>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The task of representing speech stimuli as electrical stimuli is
      central to the design of cochlear implants. Designs vary according to (1)
      the placement, number, and relationship among the electrodes; (2) the way
      in which stimulus information is conveyed from an external processor to
      the electrodes; and (3) how the electrical stimuli are derived from the
      speech input (and other signals). Changes in cochlear implant
      design/processing strategies and their effects on auditory performance are
      discussed in the section on technical and safety considerations.</font></p>
      <h2><font face="Arial" size="3">2. What Are the Benefits and
      Limitations of Cochlear Implantation?</font></h2>
      <SS1>
      <h4><font face="Arial" size="3">Impact on Speech Perception in Adults</font></h4>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Cochlear implantation has a profound impact on hearing and speech
      perception in postlingually deafened adults. Most individuals demonstrate
      significantly enhanced speech reading capabilities, attaining scores of
      90-100 percent correct on everyday sentence materials. Speech recognition
      afforded by the cochlear implant effectively supplements the information
      least favorably cued through speech reading. A majority of those
      individuals with the latest speech processors for their implants will
      score above 80-percent correct on high-context sentences, even without
      visual cues. Performance on single-word testing in these individuals is
      notably poorer, although these scores have improved significantly with
      newer speech-processing strategies. Recognition of environmental sounds
      and even appreciation of music have been repeatedly observed in adult
      implant recipients. Noisy environments remain a problem for
      cochlear-implanted adults, significantly detracting from speech-perception
      abilities. Prelingually deafened adults generally show little improvement
      in speech perception scores after cochlear implantation, but many of these
      individuals derive satisfaction from hearing environmental sounds and
      continue to use their implants.</font></p>

      <h4><font face="Arial" size="3">Speech Perception, Speech Production, and Language Acquisition in
      Children</font></h4>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Improvements in the speech perception and speech production of children
      following cochlear implantation are often reported as primary benefits.
      Variability across children is substantial. Factors such as age of onset,
      age of implantation, the nature and intensity of (re)habilitation, and
      mode of communication contribute to this variability. Using tests commonly
      applied to children and adults with hearing impairments (e.g., pattern
      perception, closed-set word identification, open-set perception),
      perceptual performance increases on average with each succeeding year post
      implantation. Shortly after implantation, performance may be broadly
      comparable to that of some children with hearing aids and over time may
      improve to match that of children who are highly successful hearing aid
      users. Children implanted at younger ages are on average more accurate in
      their production of consonants, vowels, intonation, and rhythm. Speech
      produced by children with implants is more accurate than speech produced
      by children with comparable hearing losses using vibrotactile devices or
      hearing aids. One year after implantation, speech intelligibility is twice
      that typically reported for children with profound hearing impairments and
      continues to improve. Oral-aural communication training appears to result
      in substantially greater speech intelligibility than manually based total
      communication.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The language outcomes in children with cochlear implants have received
      less attention. Reports involving small numbers of children suggest that
      implantation in conjunction with education and habilitation leads to
      advances in oral language acquisition. Data on cognitive and academic
      development following implantation are not yet available. The nature and
      pace of language acquisition may be influenced by the age of onset, age at
      implantation, nature and intensity of habilitation, and mode of
      communication.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">One current limitation is that children are typically implanted at no
      earlier than 2 years of age, which is beyond putative critical periods of
      auditory input for the acquisition of oral language. Benefits are not
      realized immediately, but rather are manifested over time, with some
      children continuing to show improvement over several years.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Few studies have used language as an outcome measure. The assessment of
      speech perception, language production, and language comprehension in
      young children is particularly challenging. Furthermore, results in
      children have been reported for single-channel or feature-based devices
      only, which do not include the effects of the relatively rapid evolution
      of alternatives in speech-coding strategies. Oral language development in
      deaf children, including those with cochlear implants, remains a slow,
      training-intensive process, and results typically are delayed in
      comparison with normally hearing peers.</font></p>
      </SS1>
      <SS1>
      <h4><font face="Arial" size="3">Psychologic and Social Issues in Adults and Children</font></h4>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Although psychological evaluation has been a part of the preimplant
      evaluation process, comparatively little research has been conducted on
      the long-term psychological and social effects of implantation. Still, the
      psychological and social impact for adults is generally positive, and
      there appears to be agreement between preimplantation expectations and
      later benefit. This benefit is expressed as a decline in loneliness,
      depression, and social isolation and an increase in self-esteem,
      independence, social integration, and vocational prospects.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Many adult implant recipients report being able to function socially or
      vocationally in ways comparable to those with moderate hearing loss.
      Furthermore, they describe a new or renewed curiosity about the experience
      of hearing and the phenomena of sound. In some cases the experience of
      implantation becomes an integral part of the individual's identity,
      leading these implant users to participate and share experiences in
      support and advocacy groups.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Negative psychological and social impact is less frequently observed
      and is often related to concerns about the maintenance and/or malfunction
      of the implant and external hardware. Other social insecurities may result
      from the difficulty of hearing amidst background noise, and from
      unreasonable expectations of aural-only benefit on the part of implant
      users or their family and friends.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The assessment of psychological impact in children with implants lags
      behind that for the adult population, in part because psychological
      outcome is a factor of audiological benefit, which is realized more slowly
      in children. Additionally, such assessment must consider the child's
      family setting. Because language acquisition is closely associated with
      identity, social development, and social integration, the impact of
      implantation on a child's development in these areas deserves more study
      to produce useful indicators that can bear upon the parental
      decision-making processes.</font></p>
      </SS1>
      <SS1>
      <h4><font face="Arial" size="3">Rehabilitation and Educational Issues</font></h4>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Although a cochlear implant can provide dramatic augmentation of the
      auditory information perceived by deaf children and adults, training and
      educational intervention are fundamental for optimal postimplant benefit.
      Access to postimplant rehabilitation involving professionals familiar with
      cochlear implants must be provided to ensure successful outcomes for
      implant recipients.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Rehabilitation efforts must be tailored to meet individual needs, and
      protocols should be developed to reflect therapies effective for various
      types of individuals receiving implants. Therapeutic intervention with
      prelingually deaf adults may differ significantly in both time and content
      from that with postlingually deaf recipients.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Pediatric cochlear implantation requires a multidisciplinary team
      composed of physicians, audiologists, speech-language pathologists,
      rehabilitation specialists, and educators familiar with deafness and
      cochlear implants. These professionals must work together in a long-term
      relationship to support the child's auditory and oral development.
      Although the effects of communication mode in implantation habilitation
      have not been sufficiently documented, it is clear that the educational
      programs for children with cochlear implants must include auditory and
      speech instruction using the auditory information offered by the implant.</font></p>
      </SS1>
      <SS1>
      <h4><font face="Arial" size="3">Cost-Utility</font></h4>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The cost-benefit or cost-utility of cochlear implantation must be
      calculated separately for adults and children. For adults, the cost of
      cochlear implantation includes the initial costs of assessment, the
      device, implantation, rehabilitation, system overhead, and maintenance.
      The benefit or utility is estimated as a function of quality of life over
      time. On this basis, cochlear implantation whether at age 45 years or 70
      years compares quite favorably to many medical procedures now commonly in
      use (e.g., implantable defibrillator insertion).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The cost-utility estimates for children also appear to be quite
      favorable, but we are still in the early stages of cochlear implant
      application and cannot yet estimate the cost or potential cost savings
      that will accrue in the area of (re)habilitation and education.</font></p>
      <h2><font face="Arial" size="3">3. What Are the Technical and
      Safety Considerations of Cochlear Implantation?</font></h2>
      <SS1>
      <h4><font face="Arial" size="3">Cochlear Implant Design Issues</font></h4>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">A cochlear implant works by providing direct electrical stimulation to
      the auditory nerve, bypassing the usual transducer cells that are absent
      or nonfunctional in a deaf cochlea. Over the past 10 years, significant
      improvements have been made in the technology used to accomplish auditory
      stimulation.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The best performance in speech recognition occurs with intracochlear
      electrodes that are close to the nerve fibers to be stimulated, thus
      minimizing undesirable side effects.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Early implants used only a single electrode; these single-channel
      implants rarely provide open-set speech perception. Most recent implants
      use multielectrode arrays that provide a number of independent channels of
      stimulation. Such devices provide more information about the acoustic
      signal and give better performance on speech recognition. No agreement
      exists on the optimum number of channels, although at least 4-6 channels
      seem to be necessary.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Much of the recent progress in implant performance has involved
      improvements in the speech processors, which convert sound into electrical
      stimuli. The best performance comes with speech processors that attempt to
      preserve the normal frequency code or spectral representation of the
      cochlea. These are distinguished from feature-based processors, which
      attempt to analyze certain features known to be important to speech
      perception and present only those features through the electrodes. A major
      problem in multichannel implants is channel interaction, in which two
      electrodes stimulate overlapping populations of nerves. Channel
      interaction has now been minimized with speech processors that activate
      the electrodes in a nonsimultaneous or interleaved fashion; this has been
      shown to improve speech recognition significantly.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">A final design issue is the means by which the stimulus information is
      passed through the skin from the speech processor to the electrodes. In a
      transcutaneous system, the skin is intact and the coupling is done
      electromagnetically to an implanted antenna. In a percutaneous system, the
      leads are passed directly through the skin. The two systems have slightly
      different surgical complications, which are discussed below. The
      percutaneous system (1) provides a more flexible connection to the
      electrodes in case a change in speech processor is desired, (2) is easier
      to troubleshoot in case of electrode problems, and (3) is magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) compatible. Percutaneous systems are not
      commercially available.</font></p>
      </SS1>
      <SS1>
      <h4><font face="Arial" size="3">Issues Related to Magnetic Resonance Imaging</font></h4>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is increasingly the diagnostic tool of
      choice for a variety of medical conditions. Implants that use
      transcutaneous connectors contain an implanted magnet and some ferrous
      materials that are incompatible with the high magnetic fields of an MRI
      scanner. Implant manufacturers are redesigning their devices to circumvent
      this problem. Potential MRI risks should be part of the informed consent
      procedure for persons considering an implant. The external speech
      processor cannot be made MRI compatible and should not be taken into the
      scanner.</font></p>
      </SS1>
      <SS1>
      <h4><font face="Arial" size="3">Surgical Issues</font></h4>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Cochlear implantation entails risks common to most surgical procedures
      (e.g., general anesthetic exposure), as well as unique risks that are
      influenced by device design, individual anatomy and pathology, and
      surgical technique. Comparative data of major complications incurred in
      adult implantation show a halving of the complication rate to
      approximately 5 percent in 1993. The complication rate in pediatric
      implantation is less than that currently seen in adults. Overall, the
      complication rate compares favorably to the 10 percent rate seen with
      pacemaker/defibrillator implantation.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Major complications (i.e., those requiring revision surgery), include
      flap problems, device migration or extrusion, and device failure. Facial
      palsy, although considered a major complication, is distinctly uncommon
      and rarely permanent. No mortalities have been attributed to cochlear
      implantation.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Alterations in surgical technique, especially flap design, have led to
      a considerable reduction in the flap complication rate, which is
      particularly relevant to transcutaneous devices. Alterations in surgical
      technique, particularly in methods used to anchor the device, have
      contributed to a decrease in device migration or extrusion.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">All implants are potentially prone to failure--because of either
      manufacturing defects or use-related trauma. Pedestal fracture is a
      problem unique to the percutaneous device, but occurs rarely. Manufacturer
      redesign has produced newer electrode arrays that are smaller and sturdier
      than earlier models. For the most commonly implanted device, 95 percent of
      implants are still functioning after 9 years. Implants with transcutaneous
      connectors that do not provide self-test capability for the implanted
      portion preclude detecting electrode failure, such as open and short
      circuits. Failure recognition is particularly problematic in young
      children. The newer cochlear implants do, however, include self-test
      circuitry that allows objective device monitoring.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Minor complications, that is, those that resolve without surgical
      intervention, include unwanted facial nerve stimulation with electrode
      activation, which is readily rectified by device reprogramming. In
      percutaneous devices, pedestal infections are uncommon but can be treated
      successfully with antibiotics; on rare occasions explantation may be
      required for control.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Reimplantation is necessary in approximately 5 percent of cases because
      of improper electrode insertion or migration, device failure, serious flap
      complication, or loss of manufacturer support. In general, reimplantation
      in the same ear is usually possible, and thus far individual auditory
      performance after reimplantation equals or exceeds that seen with the
      original implant.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Long-term complications of implantation relate to flap breakdown,
      electrode migration, and receiver-stimulator migration. The potential
      consequences of otitis media have been of concern, particularly in
      children. However, as the implanted electrode becomes ensheathed in a
      fibrous envelope, it becomes isolated from the consequences of local
      infection.</font></p>
      <h2><font face="Arial" size="3">4. Who Is a Candidate for
      Cochlear Implantation?</font></h2>
      <SS1>
      <h4><font face="Arial" size="3">Adults</font></h4>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Cochlear implants are often highly successful in postlingually deafened
      adults with severe to profound hearing loss and no speech perception
      benefit from hearing aids. Previously, individuals receiving marginal
      benefit from hearing aids were not considered implant candidates.
      Ironically, such individuals often have poorer speech perception with
      hearing aids than do more severely deafened persons who use implants.
      Recent data show that most marginally successful hearing aid users will
      have improved speech perception performance with a cochlear implant.
      Therefore, it is reasonable to extend cochlear implants to postlingually
      deafened adult individuals currently obtaining marginal benefit from other
      amplification systems. Prelingually deafened adults may also be suitable
      for implantation, although these candidates must be counseled regarding
      realistic expectations. Existing data indicate that these individuals
      achieve minimal improvement in speech recognition skills.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">However, other basic benefits, such as improved sound awareness, may
      provide psychological satisfaction and meet safety needs.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Because of the wide variability in speech perception and recognition in
      persons with similar hearing impairments, all candidates require indepth
      counseling about the surgery, its risks and benefits, rehabilitation, and
      alternatives to cochlear implantation. To give adequate informed consent,
      adult candidates should understand that large variability in individual
      audiologic performance precludes preoperative prediction of success.
      Determining implant candidacy requires consideration of both objective
      audiological variables as well as the subjective needs and wishes of
      individual candidates. Specific criteria for potential adult cochlear
      implant recipients are provided below.</font></p>
      <SS2>
      <h4><font face="Arial" size="3">Audiologic Criteria</font></h4>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Indications in favor of an implant are a severe-to-profound
      sensorineural hearing loss bilaterally and open-set sentence recognition
      scores less than or equal to 30 percent under best aided conditions.
      Duration of deafness and age of onset have been shown to influence
      auditory performance with cochlear implants and should be discussed with
      potential candidates.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">In general, when there is no residual hearing in either ear, the ear
      with better closed-set performance, more sensitive electrical thresholds,
      shorter period of auditory deprivation, or better radiologic
      characteristics is implanted. However, when there is residual hearing, the
      poorer ear should be chosen if there is radiologic evidence of cochlear
      patency to retain the option for continued hearing aid use and, thus, the
      potential advantages of binaural sound localization.</font></p>
      </SS2>
      <SS2>
      <h4><font face="Arial" size="3">Medical and Surgical Criteria</font></h4>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Traditionally, implantation candidacy was limited to persons in good
      health. Although there are specific medical contraindications to surgery
      and implantation, such as poor anesthetic risk, severe mental retardation,
      severe psychiatric disorders, and organic brain syndromes, cochlear
      implantation should be offered to a wider population of individuals.
      Individuals with low vision may find that implantation promotes
      independence and other quality-of-life goals. Age, per se, is not a
      contraindication to implantation.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests are
      important tools in candidacy evaluation. Individuals with active ear
      pathology require treatment and re-evaluation prior to implantation. The
      standard radiologic evaluation includes high-resolution computed
      tomography (CT) scanning to detect mixed fibrous and bony occlusions and
      anatomical abnormalities. MRI provides better resolution of soft tissue
      structures and should supplement the CT scan when indicated. These imaging
      techniques should be used to identify abnormalities that may compromise or
      impede implant surgery or device use.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The results of electrophysiologic tests do not predict implant success.
      However, in selected individuals, such as those with cochlear obliteration
      or in decisions regarding ear of implantation, the results of promontory
      stimulation may be useful.</font></p>
      </SS2>
      </SS1>
      <SS1>
      <h4><font face="Arial" size="3">Children</font></h4>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Cochlear implants have also been shown to result in successful speech
      perception in children. Currently, the earliest age of implantation is 24
      months, but there are reasons to reassess this age limit. A younger age of
      implantation may limit the negative consequences of auditory deprivation
      and may allow more efficient acquisition of speech and language.
      Determining whether cochlear implant benefits are greater in children
      implanted at age 2-3 compared with those implanted at age 4-5 might
      resolve this issue, but sufficient data are unavailable. Also, it is
      unclear whether the benefits of implantation before age 2 would offset
      potential liabilities associated with the increased difficulty in
      obtaining reliable and valid characterization of hearing and functional
      communication status at the younger age. A small number of children under
      age 2 have received implants, both internationally and in the United
      States. Cochlear implants principally have been performed in this
      population because of the risk of new bone formation associated with
      meningitis, which might preclude implantation at a later date. Speech and
      language data obtained on such children will be helpful in determining the
      potential benefits of early implantation and therefore may help to guide
      future policy.</font></p>
      <SS2>
      <h4><font face="Arial" size="3">Audiologic Criteria</font></h4>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Children age 2 years or older with profound (&gt; 90 dBHL)
      sensorineural hearing loss bilaterally and minimal speech perception under
      best aided conditions may be considered for cochlear implantation. In the
      young child, auditory brainstem response, stapedial reflex testing, and
      otoacoustic emission testing may be useful when combined with auditory
      behavioral responses to determine hearing status. Prior to implantation, a
      trial period with appropriate amplification combined with intensive
      auditory training should be attempted to ensure that maximal benefit is
      achieved. When the validity of behavioral test results is compromised by
      maturational factors, the above criteria should be applied in the most
      stringent manner (i.e., worse hearing sensitivity, longer trial periods,
      etc.). Current research may broaden audiometric criteria for candidacy to
      better reflect functional auditory capacity.</font></p>
      </SS2>
      <SS2>
      <h4><font face="Arial" size="3">Medical and Surgical Criteria</font></h4>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Children should also undergo a complete medical evaluation to rule out
      the presence of active systemic disease that would contraindicate
      implantation. The child must be otologically stable and free of active
      middle ear disease prior to cochlear implantation. The radiologic imaging
      criteria used in adult candidates are applicable to children.</font></p>
      </SS2>
      <SS2>
      <h4><font face="Arial" size="3">Psychosocial Criteria</font></h4>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Preoperative assessment should entail evaluation of the child in the
      home, social, and educational contexts to ensure that implantation is the
      proper intervention. In some instances psychosocial factors may be used as
      exclusionary criteria; however, in all cases psychosocial data should
      serve as a baseline for tracking cochlear implant outcomes. Parental
      expectations must be addressed, and commitment to habilitation is
      essential.</font></p>
      </SS2>
      <SS2>
      <h4><font face="Arial" size="3">Informed Consent</font></h4>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The parents of a deaf child are responsible for deciding whether to
      elect cochlear implantation. The informed consent process should be used
      to assist parents in making this decision. Parents must understand that
      cochlear implants do not restore normal hearing and that auditory and
      speech outcomes are highly variable and unpredictable. They must be
      informed of the advantages, disadvantages, and risks associated with
      implantation to establish realistic expectations. Furthermore, the
      importance of long-term habilitation with cochlear implants must be
      stressed. As part of the process of informed consent, parents must be told
      that alternative approaches to habilitation are available, for example
      through sign language. All children should be included in the informed
      consent process to the extent of their ability, as their active
      participation is crucial to (re)habilitative success.</font></p>

      Future Research on Cochlear Implantation?</font></h2>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">Research must attempt to explain the wide variation in performance

        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">Studies of the effects of cochlear stimulation on auditory neurons
          have provided clear evidence of plasticity both in the survival of
          neural elements and in receptive field organization. Comparisons of
          neural plasticity in animal experiments and of adaptation to cochlear
          implant electrical stimulation by humans provide a unique opportunity
          to study the relationships between neural activity and auditory

          hearing, children with hearing impairment who use hearing aids, deaf
          children with cochlear implants, and deaf children using American Sign
          Language should be conducted. These studies should be longitudinal and

          perception and speech production in cochlear implant users must
          continue. Implanted deaf children provide a unique opportunity to
          examine these developmental processes and their relationship to the
          acquisition of aural-oral language. Such information is crucial to
          understanding and enhancing the performance of implanted prelingually

          need to be studied. The identification of those features and services

      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">Cochlear implantation improves communication ability in most adults
          with severe to profound deafness and frequently leads to positive
          psychological and social benefits as well. The greatest benefits seen
          to date have occurred in postlingually deafened adults.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">Cochlear implantation in prelingually deafened adults provides more
          limited improvement in speech perception, but offers important
          environmental sound awareness. Cochlear implantation outcomes are more
          variable in children. Nonetheless, gradual, steady improvement in
          speech perception, speech production, and language does occur. There
          is substantial unexplained variability in the performance of implant
          users of all ages, and implants are not appropriate for all
          individuals.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">Currently children at least 2 years old and adults with profound
          deafness are candidates for implantation. Cochlear implant candidacy
          should be extended to adults with severe hearing impairment and
          open-set sentence discrimination that is less than or equal to 30
          percent in the best aided condition. Although theoretic reasons exist
          to lower the age of implantation in children, data are too scarce to
          justify a change in criteria. Additional data may justify a change in
          age and audiologic criteria.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">Auditory performance with a cochlear implant varies among
          individuals. The data indicate that performance is better in
          individuals who (1) have shorter durations of deafness, (2) acquired
          speech and language before their hearing loss occurred, and (3) if
          prelingual were implanted before age 6. Auditory performance is not
          affected by etiology of hearing loss.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">Access to optimal educational and (re)habilitation services is
          important for adults and is critical for children to maximize the
          benefits available from cochlear implantation.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">The current generation of intracochlear, multichannel implants with
          spectrally based speech processors provides a substantial improvement
          over the previous generation of devices, especially when
          nonsimultaneous electrode activation is used.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">The low complication rate and high reliability for cochlear implants
          compare favorably with other implanted electronic devices and continue
          to improve.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">Most devices are not MRI compatible, and users and physicians should
          be acutely aware of this problem. Implant manufacturers should modify
          future devices to be MRI compatible and to include internal self-test
          systems.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">Percutaneous connectors offer many research and clinical advantages,
          including MRI compatibility, ease of electrode testing, and processor
          upgrading, and they should not be abandoned.</font></li>
