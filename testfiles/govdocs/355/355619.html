			<h2><span lang="en-us">ICD-9-CM Coordination and Maintenance 
			Committee 2008 Summary</span></h2>
			<h3><span lang="en-us">V</span>olumes 1 and 2, Diagnosis 
			Presentations<br>
			March 19-20, 2008</h3>
		<p>The diagnosis portion of the meeting began on March 19th following 
		the completion of the procedure topics. Donna Pickett, co-chair of the 
		committee, welcomed the members of the audience. She reviewed the 
		timeline included at the beginning of the topic packet informing the 
		attendees that any written comments on topics being considered for 
		October 1, 2008 must be received by NCHS staff by April 11, 2008. She 
		also announced that comments for all other topics presented at this 
		meeting for consideration for October 1, 2009 would need to be submitted 
		by June 20, 2008. NCHS has begun a new policy that comments for the 
		Spring C&amp;M meeting will no longer be accepted all year as has been the 
		case in the past. She requested that comments be sent via electronic 
		mail since regular mail is often delayed due to security screening. The 
		email addresses of all NCHS staff and the NCHS website are included in 
		the topic packet. Attendees were also reminded that the full topic 
		packet and PowerPoint presentations would be posted on the NCHS website 
		shortly following the meeting.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Ms. Pickett also announced that continuing education (CE) credits 
		would be available at the close of the meeting for both AHIMA credits 
		and for AACC credits. 6 CE credits were awarded for Wednesday and 6 CE 
		credits were awarded for Thursday. Attendees will receive 12 credits 
		total for attending both full days.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Comments and discussion on the topics presented were as follows:</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h4>Status of TPA for stroke for October 1, 2008 consideration</h4>
		<p>Joseph P. Broderick, M.D., and Dawn Kleindorfer, M.D., representing 
		the American Academy of Neurology (AAN), gave a PowerPoint presentation 
		on the incidence of ischemic stroke and the data currently available on 
		the number of stroke patients who receive t-PA treatment. The PowerPoint 
		slides will be available in a separate file on the NCHS Classifications 
		of Diseases and Functioning &amp; Disability web site. The goal is to 
		provide this beneficial treatment within 3 hours of onset on symptoms. 
		They described the term drip and ship which is when a patient is started 
		on t-PA in an emergency department then immediately transferred to a 
		specialty stroke center for intensive care. What is being requested is a 
		new code that identifies the status of a patient having received the 
		t-PA and then being transferred. Dr. Kleindorfer explained that her 
		research is hindered by the lack of data available on drip and ship 
		incidence.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Dr. Broderick stated that the proposal in the topic packet does not 
		include the definition that the AAN is requesting for the code title, 
		which is<span lang="en-us"> </span>history of receiving rt-PA for acute 
		ischemic stroke in another hospital<span lang="en-us">&#39;</span>s 
		emergency department within the last 24 hours.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>A comment was made that it is often over 3 hours before stroke 
		patients present to a hospital, and the question was asked whether there 
		is any data on this. The answer was given that about 80 percent do not 
		arrive quickly enough for treatment with tPA, and ultimately only about 
		8% are actually eligible.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>A physician representing the stroke center at Johns Hopkins 
		University Medical Center as well as the Maryland Stroke Alliance 
		strongly supported the proposal. He assured the audience that 
		documentation in the medical record at specialty stroke centers is 
		required to be very detailed and would provide the information necessary 
		to assign this new code. He noted that it was extremely important to 
		have this data, and that it would help to make decisions.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>A question was raised as to whether patients are transferred while 
		receiving tPA, or afterward. The answer given was that either can occur, 
		although usually giving tPA will be completed before transfer. It was 
		noted that sometimes tPA does not work, and other treatments may be 
		tried at a stroke center. </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Several members of the audience expressed concern at the length and 
		specificity of the code title proposed. There was support expressed for 
		using the full definition in the code. It was also stated that the code 
		should be broad enough to allow its use for t-PA treatment for other 
		conditions as well, such as acute MI. There was a response that the 
		neurologists would prefer to have a specific code that would enable 
		unique identification of cases being treated for stroke. A comment was 
		made that a specific definition is needed.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>There was also concern expressed about the 24 hour timeframe, and how 
		it was defined. There was a comment that this could be better handled as 
		an aftercare code. The possibility was also raised of using a procedure 
		code for tracking these cases.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The audience was reminded that this topic is being considered for 
		implementation this October; comments are needed by April 11.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h4>Other venous embolism and thrombosis</h4>
		<p>Patrick Romano, M.D., representing the Agency for Healthcare Research 
		and Quality (AHRQ) gave a PowerPoint presentation on coding of venous 
		embolism and thrombosis. He explained that the current ICD-9-CM codes 
		are outdated from a terminology standpoint and that phlebitis is no 
		longer considered an important component of thrombosis.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>He also explained that it would be very helpful to be able to 
		distinguish between patients who are being treated for an acute embolic 
		or thrombotic event, and those who are on anticoagulation therapy for an 
		extended period during what he described as the subacute or chronic 
		period of treatment, which is generally 3 to 6 months. There is also a 
		third category of patients who are at high risk for future clots and so 
		are maintained on anticoagulants for a life time. At this time it is not 
		possible to distinguish cases that resolved in the more distant past 
		from cases still on treatment. He noted that the 5th digits for acute MI 
		in the ICD-9-CM allow for the classification of initial versus 
		subsequent episode of care, which is similar to the concept he is 
		interested in capturing for embolism of thrombosis. He noted that the 
		coding options included in the topic packet are a beginning framework 
		and that alternative options will be considered.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>A comment was made that the terms subacute and chronic are not used 
		to describe embolism and thrombosis. The question was raised whether 
		this would be more properly a history of<span lang="en-us"> </span>
		rather than subacute or chronic. There was also a comment that there is 
		the potential for overlap between these proposed codes and the personal 
		history codes.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>A comment was made about the iatrogenic code, and how it is used, and 
		uncertainty on how often it is actually used. Another comment raised the 
		issue of whether iatrogenic cases needed to be specifically identified 
		at category 453. The question was also raised whether a catheter 
		associated code was needed.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>There was a comment that the term episode of care is too generic and 
		that the terms initial and subsequent encounter are more descriptive and 
		better understood. Another comment noted that using episode of care 
		would be problematic, and unclear whether it would depend on the time 
		and facility involved.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Dr. Jeffrey Linzer, representing the American Academy of Pediatrics 
		(AAP), expressed support for the proposal, but noted a preference for 
		the alternate option described. He also suggested that the proposed code 
		453.7 could be instead handled with fifth digits at the proposed 
		subcategories 453.5 and 453.6, with modification.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Long term anticoagulation could also be coded. It could also be 
		appropriate to consider coding for long term use of antibiotics, and of 
		Total Parenteral Nutrition. </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h4>Venous complications in pregnancy and the puerperium</h4>
		<p>Patrick Romano, M.D., representing the Agency for Healthcare Research 
		and Quality (AHRQ) also presented a proposal for coding of major 
		puerperal infections and venous complications of pregnancy. Subcategory 
		670, Major puerperal infections, needs to be expanded to provide codes 
		for the different types of infections included in the subcategory. And 
		similar to the issues he presented for embolism and thrombosis, the 
		concepts for acute and subacute and chronic would also be useful for the 
		equivalent OB codes. He noted that the American College of Ob/Gyn 
		supports this proposal.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>There was support from the audience for the expansion of subcategory 
		670. There was a comment that most cases with 671.4 had septic pelvic 
		thrombophlebitis. There were no additional comments for this proposal.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h4>Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)&nbsp; for October 
		1, 2008 consideration</h4>
		<p>Rachel Gorwitz, M.D., of the Centers for Disease Control and 
		Prevention<span lang="en-us">&#39;</span>s Division of Healthcare Quality 
		Promotion, gave an audio and PowerPoint presentation on the increasing 
		problem of MRSA in the population and the difficulty in treating 
		patients resistant to this class of antibiotics.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>There was extremely strong support from many members of the audience 
		for this proposal. A further expansion of MRSA for other infections, 
		such as staphylococcal meningitis (320.3), was also requested.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>There was some question on the need for the V09 expansion, with the 
		other expansions and particularly the 041 expansion. Concern was raised 
		about whether V09 would need to be used with each of the new codes 
		created, as this would not provide any additional information. It was 
		explained that the V09 is a longstanding code to identify drug 
		resistance and its continued use may be desired by some facilities.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>There was a comment that coders should be permitted to assign a code 
		for a MRSA infection from the lab report without having to seek approval 
		from the primary provider. There was a question on whether a positive 
		nasal culture would be the same as colonization, and how coding for that 
		should be handled. It was noted that the expansion at V02 for carriers 
		of infectious diseases would make coding for carriers of MRSA more 
		specific. Adding the term colonization at the category level also would 
		be an expansion. There is also another code for positive cultures 
		(795.39), and instruction would be needed to differentiate use of the 
		codes. It would also be important to differentiate cases with MRSA 
		colonization and those with history of MRSA.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>One commenter noted that other staphylococcus should still be 
		included at the code V02.59, for carriers of other staphylococcus 
		besides S. aureus. </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>One question asked why stop with pneumonia, and why not have codes 
		for UTI (urinary tract infection) and cellulitis. It was noted that 
		there are not specific codes for these, and expanding may not be 
		feasible within the existing ICD structure. However, for such cases the 
		existing codes can be used with an 041 code.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Another comment was that family history of MRSA and exposure to MRSA 
		can be important reasons for screening or further testing. Thus, codes 
		for these situations could be useful.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The audience was reminded that this topic is being considered for 
		implementation this October; comments are needed by April 11.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h4>Fever and other physiologic disturbances of temperature regulation 
		for October 1, 2008 consideration</h4>
		<p>There was general support for this proposal. It was suggested that 
		the excludes note fever or chills due to confirmed infection code to 
		infection, be added at the subcategory level, since it applies to all of 
		the codes in this subcategory. It was also suggested that the proposed 
		code 780.60 have an excludes note for neonatal fever, to code 778.4.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The audience was reminded that this topic is being considered for 
		implementation this October; comments are needed by April 11.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h4>Disruption of operation wound&nbsp; for October 1, 2008 
		consideration</h4>
		<p>Sue Bowman, representing the American Health Information Management 
		Association (AHIMA), questioned the inclusion added at the 998.3 
		subcategory disruption of any suture materials or method. She 
		specifically asked what a disruption of a method referred to.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Dr. Nagel asked how a disrupted wound due to trauma would be coded, 
		trauma/injury code or disruption of wound code. That needs to be 
		decided.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The audience was reminded that this topic is being considered for 
		implementation this October; comments are needed by April 11.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h4>Activity codes/Injuries and external cause codes for military 
		operations for October 1, 2008 consideration</h4>
		<p><span lang="en-us">L</span>t. Col. Steven Bullock gave a PowerPoint 
		presentation on the Department of Defense<span lang="en-us">&#39;</span>s 
		need to identify the cause of injuries to military personnel. It is a 
		major factor in determining military readiness. The military has been 
		directed by the Office of the Secretary of Defense to reduce and prevent 
		injuries, so collection of this data is essential to achieve this goal. 
		His presentation covered the activity codes and also the military 
		proposals related to injuries, family circumstances, psychosocial 
		circumstances, and external cause codes.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>In both Lt. Col. Bullock<span lang="en-us">&#39;</span>s presentation and 
		in the topic discussion that followed it was explained that the proposed 
		activity codes are parallel to what is now in the ICD-10-CM and that 
		there is no redundancy with the existing codes. Activity and transport 
		accidents are mutually exclusive concepts in the ICD, and extensive 
		guidelines would be provided for the use of activity codes.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>There were many comments on these topics. Many expressed strong 
		objection to implementing these proposals for this year due to their 
		length and the lack of time to properly review them. One commenter 
		stated that the injury community at large has not had an opportunity to 
		review the proposals. It was noted that E codes are required by a number 
		of states for various purposes, and these proposed expansions would be 
		expected to impact them. </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Concerns were raised about the activity codes particularly. Concern 
		was raised about overlap with existing E codes, where activity may be 
		implied in various codes (such as certain transport accident and 
		accidental injury codes). Concern was raised about how well the proposed 
		codes would cover all activities, with an example given of housework, 
		not being leisure nor paid work, and thus not fitting well with the 
		proposed codes at E000, Activity code status. A specific concern also 
		was raised about mixing American tackle football and rugby. One 
		commenter noted that it would be important to make clear that the 
		proposed code for cell phone usage did not include usage while driving.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Dr. Jeffrey Linzer, representing the American Academy of Pediatrics 
		(AAP), expressed support for the parts of the proposal related to 
		injuries, family circumstances, psychosocial circumstances, and external 
		cause codes. However, he expressed concerns related to the activity 
		codes. He noted concerns about whether some things may be missing. He 
		stated he would like to take time to be sure the activity code expansion 
		will be effective.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Concerns were raised about student activities, including fraternity 
		sports, that it would be unclear how these should be coded in the 
		current proposal. Also, a question was raised on how to code sports for 
		military schools, and whether this would be leisure, student, work, or 
		military related activity.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>One commenter stated that she did not feel this proposal should be 
		expedited. She noted that her organization creates tools for use with 
		ICD-9-CM, and she stated that it would be difficult to do in the time 
		frame required.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>There was also concern that there are many states that require E 
		codes and because they will need to update their reporting systems prior 
		to October, if these are implemented this year, that notification will 
		need to be published soon. The audience was also reminded that since E 
		codes are not published in the IPPS Federal Register notice (Table 6), 
		since they are not part of the PPS system, a separate Federal Register 
		notice will need to be published by CDC to announce these codes.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The audience was reminded that these topics are being considered for 
		implementation this October; comments are needed by April 11.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h4>Exposure to harmful chemicals and other harmful substances for 
		October 1, 2008 consideration</h4>
		<p>One person asked why a new code was not included for exposure to 
		mercury. It was suggested to exclude exposure to lead (V15.86) from 
		exposure to metals (V87.0). There was a comment on proposed code V87.2, 
		related to whether it was appropriate to include exposure to gas and 
		hydrocarbons as potential inclusion terms. Other potential exposures 
		were noted for which it could be useful to be able to code encounters, 
		including exposures to chlorine gas, clay dust, coal dust, and meat 
		packing.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>It was suggested that the title at V87.3 be changed to reflect 
		exposure to other potentially hazardous biological substances. This 
		would be more specific, and would include mold. It was suggested that a 
		code V87.8 also be created for exposure to other potentially hazardous 
		substances (rather than using this title at the proposed code V87.39).</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The audience was reminded that this topic is being considered for 
		implementation this October; comments are needed by April 11.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h4>Incidental Dural Tear&nbsp; for October 1, 2008 consideration</h4>
		<p>John Shaw, President of NextWave, gave a PowerPoint presentation on 
		dural tears, also referred to as incidental durotomies. Though they are 
		most common during complex spinal cord procedures, and in these cases 
		often referred to as incidental, they may also occur during other types 
		of procedures. Regardless, they should always be coded, due to the 
		complications they can produce, such as cerebrospinal fluid leak and the 
		associated headache. Dural tears generally necessitate extending 
		in-patient hospital stays.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>There was strong support for this code. Concerning the placement of 
		the code within the classification, support was expressed for creating a 
		code within the nervous system chapter rather than the complications 
		section of codes. It was felt that providers would be more likely to 
		accept and use the code if it were in Chapter 6. There was also support 
		for including the term incidental durotomy as an inclusion term, since 
		it is a term frequently used to describe dural tears, although as it is 
		labeled incidental, it may be overlooked. One concern was raised as to 
		whether including the term incidental would lead to questions of whether 
		to code other things referred to as incidental; this should not usually 
		be the case.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>One commenter expressed support for either option, and noted that if 
		expansion was done at 998.2, that it would be possible to identify other 
		major punctures and lacerations that occur during procedures.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>There was some discussion about use of procedure codes for dural tear 
		repair, and how tracking might be able to use a procedure code.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>There was the comment that non-surgical dural tears do occur and that 
		the codes should distinguish this.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>There were also comments regarding the use additional code notes in 
		the proposals. The ICD generally has not included use additional code 
		notes with lists of possible risk factors. Some felt that the proposal 
		might be better without the use additional code note, for consistency in 
		handling risk factors. One commenter stated he had no argument with the 
		conditions listed, and stated that similar things could be added in 
		other places.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Though this topic was not initially presented for consideration for 
		October 1, 2008, the presenter asked that it might be considered for 
		this due to the importance of tracking dural tears and because the 
		subject has been discussed in the past. Dural tears was added to the 
		ICD-9-CM as an index entry with the October 2007 addenda.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The audience was notified that this topic will be considered for 
		implementation this October; comments are needed by April 11.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h4>Hepatic coma and hepatic encephalopathy</h4>
		<p><span lang="en-us">T</span>here were a couple of comments that the 
		term hepatic coma is generally not used. Common terminology is just 
		hepatic encephalopathy. It was suggested that instead of expanding the 
		code it be retitled to hepatic encephalopathy and the term hepatic coma 
		be an inclusion term.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h4>Premature birth status</h4>
		<p><span lang="en-us">T</span>here was a comment that these new codes 
		would overlap with the codes from the perinatal chapter (at 765.2), 
		since perinatal codes are to be used for the life of a patient. It was 
		discussed that these codes would be used when there is no current health 
		problem specifically associated with the prematurity, but the status is 
		an important consideration to document, since there are risks 
		associated, and it may impact future care. There may also be preventive 
		treatments needed, or psychosocial issues, without a current physical 
		diagnosis related to the prematurity. A comment was made that notes 
		would be needed to clarify how the proposed codes should be used, as 
		opposed to other existing codes.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>There were comments that it would be preferable to have these codes 
		in another section of the classification, since it is a personal history 
		concept. There was also a comment that the code titles should read, 
		completed weeks of gestation.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>A question was raised about whether similar codes would be needed for 
		post mature deliveries, with the response that there are not the same 
		long term issues. </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h4>Acute chemical conjunctivitis</h4>
		<p>It was asked whether this code overlaps with the poisoning codes. It 
		does not overlap, since chemical conjunctivitis is not due to an 
		overdose of a chemical which is the ICD definition of poisoning. But it 
		was noted that it may be helpful for poisonings to be excluded from the 
		proposed code. There was also a comment that it would be appropriate to 
		add a use additional E code note for adverse effects under the code. A 
		question was asked as to whether the proposed code would include 
		conjunctivitis related to pepper spray, with the response being 
		affirmative.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h4>Acute heart failure</h4>
		<p>There was a discussion among the audience that this proposal deviates 
		from the current coding of acute pulmonary edema associated with heart 
		failure described as congestive, even though it matches cases not 
		described as congestive. There were suggestions that instead of 
		identifying the presence of pulmonary edema in the heart failure codes, 
		it could be coded using a separate code, such as 514 for pulmonary edema 
		or 518.4 for acute pulmonary edema, although if this were to be done, 
		the excludes notes at these codes would need to be reviewed. There was 
		also concern expressed that these proposed codes overlap with the codes 
		for systolic and diastolic heart failure.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Nelly Leon-Chisen, Director of the Central Office on ICD-9-CM of the 
		American Hospital Association </p>
		<p>(AHA), the organization that submitted the original proposal, 
		commented that the proposal submitted by the AHA only asked for codes 
		for acute and chronic forms of heart failure, and that this proposal as 
		presented was more extensive than their initial request.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>A comment was also made that along with the proposed changes adding 
		codes for acute and chronic rheumatic heart failure, there should also 
		be a change to the title at the existing code 398.91, to add unspecified 
		at the end of the code title.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h4>Family circumstances</h4>
		<p>There was approval from the audience on this proposal. It was stated 
		that a code for problems between parent and biological child would also 
		be needed. There was no preference stated between the two options for 
		foster care status. There were comments related to the proposed code for 
		substance abuse in family, and potential ramifications of using such a 
		code. It was also noted that there could be a need for a way to code 
		problems due to death of a parent.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h4>Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome</h4>
		<p>There were no comments on this proposal.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h4>Nursemaid<span lang="en-us">&#39;</span>s Elbow</h4>
		<p>Some commenters stated a preference that the title of the code be 
		Nursemaid<span lang="en-us">&#39;</span>s elbow, since that is the commonly 
		used term. The term subluxation of radial head is usually not 
		documented. There was the question of whether a subluxation should be 
		coded within the dislocation codes. It was confirmed that the ICD groups 
		subluxation and dislocation together.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>One person raised a concern that this will set a precedent to allow 
		coding subluxation separately from dislocation. The issue was also 
		raised as to what age group would be involved with this condition. It 
		was stated that the diagnosis would not be made after 5 years of age. A 
		concern was expressed that the term might be applied to adults, but it 
		was stated that that would be inappropriate.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Dr. Linzer noted that the 5th digits for the other codes under 
		category 832 are not applicable for this new code.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h4>Awaiting joint prosthesis</h4>
		<p>There was extensive discussion on this proposal. The concept was 
		liked, but most commenters felt that the title was unclear. There was a 
		suggestion to title the code joint prosthesis explantation status.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>There were also comments that in some cases an explanted joint is 
		never replaced due to continuing infection or some other complication. 
		Two codes were recommended, a code for explantation status, and a reason 
		for encounter code for patients with an explanted joint being admitted 
		for the placement of a new prosthetic joint.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h4>Gastroschisis</h4>
		<p>There were no comments on this proposal.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h4>Underimmunized or lapsed immunization status</h4>
		<p>There was some discussion on the meaning of this code and how it 
		relates to the codes for vaccinations not carried out, subcategory 
		V64.0. Dr. Jeffrey Linzer, representing the American Academy of 
		Pediatrics (AAP), the organization that submitted this proposal, 
		explained that the term delinquent immunizations is the standard term 
		used by pediatricians and family practitioners.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Dr. Linzer also explained that the AAP feels that the V64.0 codes 
		should be used only when a vaccination is refused at the time of an 
		office visit. The new code proposed would be used when a child is being 
		seen, and it needs to be documented that the child has not previously 
		received vaccinations that would be expected for age.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>It was asked if it would be appropriate to use both a V64.0 code and 
		the code being proposed. Dr. Linzer agreed it would be appropriate.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h4>Encounter for serologic antibody testing</h4>
		<p>There was general agreement on this proposal, but there was a comment 
		that the includes note could be confused with other types of lab tests 
		not intended to be included with the proposed code. Immunity status 
		testing could be interpreted to be such things as allergy testing. There 
		was a comment that the code title and inclusion could also include HIV 
		antibody testing as written. </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h4>Pre-procedural evaluations</h4>
		<p>There were many commenters in favor of this proposal, but there was 
		lengthy discussion on the wording for the proposed code for laboratory 
		examination as part of a general physical examination. Some felt the 
		code title as presented was confusing. There was a suggestion to title 
		the code laboratory examination ordered as part of a general medical 
		examination, to clarify use of the code.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>There was also discussion on whether the guidelines should instruct 
		coders to use both the V70.0, Routine general medical examination at a 
		health care facility, and the proposed lab exam code. Wording of the 
		instructional note at code V70.0 will be reconsidered. It was noted that 
		V70.0 alone might be alright if all testing and examination was done at 
		one facility, but would be difficult otherwise. </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>There were also comments that the proposed addition of includes notes 
		under codes V72.6 and V72.83 should be expanded further from what was 
		proposed to better explain the intent of the codes. It was generally 
		agreed that expanded notes would be more useful.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h4>Poisoning by antidepressants and psychostimulants</h4>
		<p>There was support for this topic. There was a statement that it is 
		clinically common not to differentiate amphetamine and methamphetamine, 
		with a question of how it would be handled it if it is not clear which 
		is involved.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>There was a suggestion to consider certain specific drugs including 
		aminophylline and theophylline, as well as caffeine, which may be given 
		to neonates to stimulate breathing based on a psychostimulant effect. 
		Aminophylline is indexed elsewhere (975.7, Antiasthmatics), but can act 
		as a psychostimulant.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h4>Retinal and choroidal neoplasms of uncertain behavior</h4>
		<p>There was support for this proposal. There was a request to add an 
		excludes note for the proposed new code 239.81 to code 190.5, Malignant 
		neoplasm of retina, since this new code is for suspected melanoma of the 
		retina. There was a comment that if the medical record said suspected 
		melanoma, the coder would code melanoma (in the inpatient setting).</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h4>Inclusion body myositis (IBM)</h4>
		<p>There were no comments on this proposal.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h4>Mesial temporal sclerosis</h4>
		<p>There was a question on the intent of the excludes note on the 
		proposal excluding temporal sclerosis from the epilepsy codes. The 
		comments were that the note might be interpreted that an epilepsy code 
		and a temporal sclerosis code should not be used together, and both 
		conditions are generally present together. There were suggestions to 
		consider changing to a different type of note, or drop the note. There 
		was a comment that it would generally be appropriate to code the 
		epilepsy first.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>There were comments related to the indexing of all recurrent seizures 
		to epilepsy, with some objection to this default.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h4>Exposure to algae</h4>
		<p>There were no comments on this proposal.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h4>Addenda</h4>
		<p>There was a comment that the excludes note at 584.9 should include 
		the entire range of category 866. At codes 996.62 and 999.31, it was 
		suggested that the term Portacath should be consistently handled with 
		capitalization. There were no additional comments on the tabular addenda 
		items being considered for October 1, 2008. For the index entries being 
		considered for October 1, 2008, it was asked that the entry for end of 
		life for joint prosthesis not be approved, related to concerns about the 
		terms, and coding it as a complication. The audience was reminded that 
		any comments on these addenda items would be needed by April 11, 2008.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>For the tabular addenda items for consideration for October 1, 2009, 
		the only discussion was on the instructional note under the open wound 
		section 870-897. It was agreed that there is a possible sequencing 
		conflict between open wounds and infections such as wound botulism. No 
		final decision was reached as to how to resolve the conflict.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>For the index addenda items for consideration for October 1, 2009 the 
		only discussion was on the indexing of seizures. There was objection to 
		the indexing of Seizure(s) disorder to epilepsy, and there was a 
		response that this is a follow up to previous changes that have already 
		been made. Also, it was requested that the term non-epileptic seizure be 
		added to the index. The question of coding for alcohol withdrawal 
		related seizures was raised as an example of non-epileptic seizures.</p>
