	         <li> ROTENONE IS RELATIVELY FREE OF HAZARDS IN NORMAL USE, BECAUSE OF 1) THE LOW PERCENTAGE (1 TO 5%) COMMONLY USED IN FORMULATIONS; 2) THE UNSTABLE NATURE OF ROTENONE ... 3) ITS IRRITANT ACTIONS WHEN INGESTED ... 4) ITS LOW SOLUBILITY IN WATER. NO HUMAN FATALITIES HAVE BEEN REPORTED. ... ALTHOUGH THE MEAN LETHAL DOSE BY MOUTH VARIES WIDELY AMONG COMMON SPECIES OF LAB MAMMALS, A REASONABLE ESTIMATE FOR MAN IS 0.3 TO 0.5 G/KG. ... BECAUSE OF POOR /GI/ ABSORPTION, COARSE PARTICLES OF SOLID ROTENONE ARE MUCH LESS TOXIC THAN FINE POWDERS. FATS AND OILS PROMOTE ABSORPTION AND SO ENHANCE TOXICITY. [Gosselin, R.E., R.P. Smith, H.C.

The others experienced no inconvenience, except that one person noted a very mild smarting. When applied to the forearms as a 10% ointment in anhydrous lanolin, no local irritation or anesthesia was observed. About 10 min after derris or a water extract of it was taken into the mouth of volunteers, all experienced a sensation of numbness, as well as a metallic taste; these effects lasted 3 or 4 hr ... .

	         <li> A previously healthy 3.5-yr old girl died after drinking about 10 mL of an insecticidal preparation of rotenone ... Symptoms were initial vomiting and drowsiness leading rapidly to coma, depressed respiration, and apnea. Despite artificial ventilation begun within 2-2.5 hr of ingestion, the girl died at 8-8.5 hr. Postmortem showed anoxic damage in the cerebrum, lungs, and heart and serohemorrhagic pleural effusion. There was also evidence of an acute renal tubular necrosis, but the authors suggested that this could have been due to various etherial oils present in the insecticide. HPLC analysis of postmortem tissues showed rotenone concentration of 6 x 10-6 to 1 x 10-5 mol/kg and the estimated oral dose was 40 mg/kg. [Hayes, W.J., Jr., E.R. Laws, Jr., (eds.).

	         <li> Ingestion of rotenone was a common means of suicide by native of New Ireland ... When such persons were brought to medical attention while still alive, they were found to be in a state of collapse with feeble pulse and dilated pupils. Some, especially those suspected of having taken a very small dose, recovered following gastric lavage and stimulants. The only finding in numerous autopsies was that of acute congestive heart failure. The root was not generally found in the stomach, as vomiting before death was the rule. [Hayes, W.J., Jr., E.R.

Physicians observed some cases of severe irritation of the throat with partial destruction of the soft palate as well as of the anterior pillars and, very frequently, an irritation of the conjunctiva followed by ulcerative keratitis. Inflammation of the skin was notable in skin folds or where perspiration led to accumulation of the powder. [Hayes, W.J., Jr., E.R. Laws, Jr., (eds.). Handbook of Pesticide Toxicology. Volume 2.

	         <li> All workers in Lyon who encountered the fine powder developed in 2 or 3 days a violent dermatitis of the genital region. It was characterized by a red-violet color, slight edema, and some itching. In 24 hr, if exposure was topped, the irritated skin underwent desquamation in plaques of different sizes. If contact persisted, the dermatitis became worse; itching, erythema, and the leatherlike texture increased. The skin became covered with large, flat, excoriated, oozing papules in patches 0.5 cm in diameter. The dermatitis recurred with each new exposure. Workers also experienced ulcerative rhinitis and temporary but complete loss of the sense of smell. In some instances there was irritation of the lips and tongue. [Hayes, W.J., Jr., E.R.

	         <li> A 90% mortality of the 4th instar larvae of Aedes aegypti occurred after exposure for 24 hr to 1 day-aged rotenone (4 ppm) extracted from Derris elliptica roots. The mortality percentage was dose-dependent and decreased by aging rotenone extracts. The toxicity of rotenone to mosquitoes was completely lost within 14-15 days after extraction. The content of rotenone in roots was higher (2.27%) in winter than in summer (1.6%). [Ameen M et al; J Bangladesh Acad Sci 7 (1-2): 39-47 (1983)]**PEER REVIEWED**<br> </li>
	         <li> Technical grades of rotenone at 0, 2.5, 5 or 10 mg/kg doses, suspended in corn oil, were administered orally in single doses on days 6-15 of pregnancy to Wistar rats. The dams were killed on the last day of pregnancy and all fetuses were evaluated following routine teratologic methods. Rotenone was associated with an increased number of non-pregnant rats and resorptions at 10 mg/kg dose; reductions in maternal body wt gain, fetal wt and skeletal ossification; and increased incidence of extra ribs at 5-10 mg/kg; no significant effects were noted at 2.5 mg/kg.

	         <li> Applications of 2 or 5 ul/l concn of synergized rotenone (2.5%) in the Pro-Noxfish formulation to 2 shallow, 0.05 hectare ponds caused a temporary reduction in both total number and diversity of benthic invertebrates, a total mortality of caged Asiatic clams (Corbicula manilensis) in both ponds, and a partial mortality of a resident population of larval leopard frogs (Rana pipiens) in the 5 ul/l treatment. At day 7 after treatment, benthic organisms were reduced 67% by the 2 ul/l concn and 96% by the 5 ul/l application. The diversity index declined sharply in both ponds between days 3 and 7 after treatment, the lowest values being recorded on day 7 and day 37 in the 2 and 5 ul/l treatments, respectively. The equitability index declined from day 3 to day 37 in both ponds. By day 69, however, total numbers of benthic organisms had more than doubled over those originally present in the 2 ul/l treatment, had more than tripled in the 5 ul/l treatment, and were virtually unchanged in the control pond. Pretreatment zooplankton populations were low; no significant deleterious effects from the treatments were observed.

	         <li> Rotenone was tested for mutagenicity in the Salmonella/microsome preincubation assay using a protocol approved by the National Toxicology Program. Rotenone was tested over a wide range of doses (0, 100, 333, 1000, 3333, and 10,000 ug/plate) in four Salmonella typhimurium strains (TA98, TA100, TA1535, and TA1537) in the presence and absence of Aroclor-induced rat or hamster liver S9. Rotenone was negative in these tests and the highest ineffective dose level tested (not causing the formation of a precipitate) in any Salmonella tester strain was 333 ug/plate. [Zeiger E et al; Environ Mutagen 9: 1-110 (1987)]**PEER REVIEWED**<br> </li>
	         <li> Rotenone was not mutagenic when tested according to a preincubation protocol with Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100, TA1535, TA1537, and TA98 with or without metabolic activation by rat or hamster liver S9. Rotenone induced forward mutations in the mouse L5178K/TK + or - lymphoma assay without activation; it was not tested in the presence of S9. Results of tests with rotenone in Chinese hamster oveary cells were negative for induction of sister chromatid exchanges in the absence of exogenous metabolic activation (at concentrations at which the chemical was very toxic), equivocal for sister chromatid exchanges in the presence of rat liver S9 (due to a nonrepeatable positive response when tests were conducted up to toxic concentrations), and negative for chromosomal aberratons in both the presence and absence of metabolic activation.

	         <li> It is about one half as toxic as pyrethrum. Rotenone dust affects the nervous system and causes convulsions in animals. Animals repeatedly fed derris powder (the botanical source containing 9.6% rotenone) at levels from 312 to 4,000 ppm developed focal liver necrosis and mild kidney damage. Of 40 female rats given daily intraperitoneal injections of rotenone in sunflower oil of 1.7 mg/kg for 42 days, more than 60% developed mammary tumors 6-11 months after the end of treatment; most of the tumors were mammary adenomas and one was a differentiated adenocarcinoma; none of the control animals had tumors when examined 19 months after treatment.

	         <li> Dogs fed rotenone at the rate of 5 mg/kg/day for a month appeared well but showed fatty changes of the liver and kidneys. A dosage of 10 mg/kg/day killed 3/5 dogs, and one that was killed showed severe toxic injury of the liver, with possibly 1/3 of the bulk occupied by fat. [Hayes, W.J., Jr., E.R. Laws, Jr., (eds.).

	         <li> ... daily oral admin of rotenone to female rats at 5 mg/kg on days 6-15 of pregnancy resulted in reduced maternal weight gain and that 10 mg/kg/day killed 60% of the dams. ... the high dose increased the number of resorptions, but without producing significant fetal abnormalities. Some skeletal malformations such as extra ribs were seen at 5 mg/kg/day although this dose rate did not increase resorptions. Dosing at 2.5 mg/kg/day had no effects. [Hayes, W.J., Jr., E.R.

	         <li> There is some disagreement in the literature regarding the carcinogenic potential of rotenone ... rotenone may cause tumors only in vitamin-deficient animals. Rotenone suppresses weight gain at or above 50 ppm in the diet of rats ... or hamsters ... and so suppression of cell division may limit carcinogenic potential ... increased serum growth hormone, progesterone, and estrogen levels may be involved in rotenone carcinogenesis and showed a parallel between tumor incidence and low-level rotenone-induced obesity in rats.

	         <li> Rotenone is a potential spindle poison. At concn ranging from 1 x 10-7 to 1 x 10-5 M, the compound causes an increase in the mitotic index of cultured hamster cells within 15 min. The index reaches a peak, the height of which is proportional to the concn of the compound. [Hayes, W.J., Jr., E.R. Laws, Jr., (eds.). Handbook of Pesticide Toxicology. Volume 2.

	         <li> Rotenone ... reduced the background incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in male B6C3Fl mice. In the present studies, rotenone reduced the basal hepatic labeling index of male B6C3Fl mice in a dose dependent fashion and inhibited hepatocellular proliferation, but not peroxisome proliferation, induced by the peroxisome proliferator Wy-14,643. These results indicate that reduction of hepatic tumors by rotenone may have been due to decr liver cell replication, that peroxisome proliferation can be induced in the absence of hepatocellular proliferation and suggest rotenone as a potential tool in studies of relationships cell proliferation, peroxisomal proliferation and hepatocarcinogenesis.
