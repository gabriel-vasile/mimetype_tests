            </span><span class="text"> 
            <p> <strong>An emerging consensus is that somatic cell nuclear transfer 
              (SCNT) for the purpose of creating a child (also called "reproductive 
              cloning") is not acceptable for both moral and scientific reasons. 
              In contrast, SCNT with the goal of generating an embryonic stem 
              cell line ("therapeutic cloning") remains a controversial issue. 
              Although therapeutic cloning holds the promise of yielding new ways 
              of treating a number of degenerative diseases, it is not acceptable 
              to many because the derivation of an embryonic stem cell line from 
              the cloned embryo (an essential step in this process) necessarily 
              involves the loss of an embryo and hence the destruction of potential 
              human life. </strong></p>
            </span><span class="text"> 
            <p> In this article, I will develop two main arguments that are based 
              on the available scientific evidence. 1) In contrast to an embryo 
              derived by <I>in vitro</I> fertilization (IVF), a cloned embryo 
              has little if any potential to ever develop into a normal human 
              being. This is because, by circumventing the normal processes of 
              gametogenesis and fertilization, nuclear cloning prevents the proper 
              reprogramming of the clone&#39;s genome, <I></I>which is a prerequisite 
              for development of an embryo to a normal individual. It is unlikely 
              that these biological barriers to normal development can be solved 
              in the foreseeable future. Therefore, from a biologist&#39;s point 
              of view, the cloned human embryo, used for the derivation of an 
              embryonic stem cell and the subsequent therapy of a needy patient, 
              has <I>little if any potential</I> to create a normal human life. 
              <I> </I> 2) Embryonic stem cells developed from a cloned embryo 
              are functionally indistinguishable from those that have been generated 
              from embryos derived by in vitro fertilization (IVF). Both types 
              of embryonic stem cells have an <I>identical potential</I> to serve 
              as a source for therapeutically useful cells. </p>
            <p><strong>It is crucial that the ongoing debate on the possible therapeutic 
              application of SNCT is based on biological facts. The goal of this 
              article is to provide such a basis and to contribute to a more rational 
              discussion that is founded on scientific evidence rather than on 
              misconceptions or misrepresentations of the available scientific 
              data. </strong><span class="text"> </span></p>

            <p> It is important to distinguish between "reproductive cloning" 
              and "nuclear transplantation therapy" (also referred to as "SCNT" 
              or "therapeutic cloning"). In reproductive cloning a cloned embryo 
              is generated by transfer of a somatic nucleus into an enucleated 
              egg with the goal to create a cloned individual. In contrast, the 
              purpose of nuclear transplantation therapy is to generate an embryonic 
              stem cell line (referred to as "ntES cells") that is "tailored" 
              to the needs of a patient who served as the nuclear donor. The ntES 
              cells could be used as a source of functional cells that would be 
              suitable for treating an underlying disease by transplantation.

            <p> There is now experience from cloning of seven different mammalian 
              species that is relevant for three main questions of public interest: 
              1) Would a cloned human embryo be "normal"? 2) Could the problems 
              currently seen with cloning be solved in the foreseeable future? 
              3) Would ES cells derived from a cloned human embryo be "normal" 
              and useful for cell therapy? The arguments advanced in this article 
              are strictly based on molecular and biological evidence that has 
              been obtained largely in the mouse. I will not attempt to review 
              the cloning literature but only refer to selected papers on cloned 
              mice. The relevant literature on cloning of mammals can be found 
              in recent reviews (Byrne and Gurdon, 2002; Gurdon, 1999; Hochedlinger 
              and Jaenisch, 2002b; Oback and Wells, 2002; Rideout et al., 2001; 
              Wilmut, 2001; Young et al., 1998). <span class="text"> </span></p>

            </span><span class="text"> 
            <p> The majority of cloned mammals derived by nuclear transfer (NT) 
              die during gestation, and those that survive to birth frequently 
              display "Large Offspring Syndrome", a neonatal phenotype characterized 
              by respiratory and metabolic abnormalities and enlarged and dysfunctional 
              placentas (Rideout et al., 2001; Young et al., 1998).  In order 
              for a donor nucleus to support development into a clone, it must 
              be reprogrammed to a state compatible with embryonic development.  
              The transferred nucleus must properly activate genes important for 
              early embryonic development and also suppress differentiation-associated 
              genes that had been transcribed in the original donor cell.  Inadequate 
              "reprogramming" of the donor nucleus is most likely the principal 
              reason for developmental failure of clones (for definition of "reprogramming", 
              see footnote 1). Since few clones survive to birth, the question 
              remains whether survivors are fully <B></B>normal or merely the 
              least affected animals carrying through to adulthood despite harboring 
              subtle <B></B>abnormalities that originate in faulty reprogramming 
              but that are not severe enough to interfere with survival to birth 
              or beyond. <br>

            <p> <strong>III. Reprogramming of the genome during normal development 
              and after nuclear transfer </strong></p>
            </span>
            <p>The fundamental difference between nuclear cloning and normal fertilization 
              is that the nucleus used in nuclear cloning comes from a somatic 
              (body) cell that has not undergone the developmental events required 
              to produce the egg and sperm<B>. </B> Nuclear cloning involves the 
              transplantation of a somatic nucleus into the oocyte from which 
              the nucleus has been removed.  However, the genes in the somatic 
              nucleus are not in the same state as those in the fertilized egg 
              because nuclear transplantation short-cuts the complex process of 
              egg and sperm maturation which involves extensive "reprogramming" 
              of the genome, a process that shuts some genes off and leaves others 
              on. Reprogramming during gametogenesis prepares the genome of the 
              two mature gametes with the ability to activate faithfully the genetic 
              program that ensures <B></B>normal embryonic development when they 
              combine at fertilization (Fig 1a). <B></B>This reprogramming of 
              the genome begins at gastrulation, when primordial germ cells (PGCs) 
              are formed,<B><I></I></B>and continues during differentiation into 
              mature gametes resulting,<B><I></I></B>in a radically different 
              chromatin configuration of sperm and oocyte (Rideout et al., 2001). 
            </p>
            <span class="text">
            <p> Experiments have shown that uniparental embryos (embryos whose 
              genomes are derived solely from either the maternal or paternal 
              parent) do not develop normally. Uniparental embryos first seem 
              normal; they direct cleavage (early development to the blastocyst 
              stage) despite profound differences in their epigenetic organization 
              (Reik et al., 2001). However, uniparental embryos fail soon after 
              the implantation of the embryo into the wall of the uterus, indicating 
              that both parental genomes are needed and functionally complement 
              each other beginning at this later step of embryogenesis. Presumably, 
              the different epigenetic organization of the two genomes is crucial 
              for achieving normal development. Moreover, <B></B>it has been well 
              established that the imbalance of imprinted gene expression represents 
              an important cause of embryonic failure (for definition of "imprinting", 
              see footnote 2).  </p>
            </span><span class="text"> 
            <p> In order for cloned embryos to complete development, genes normally 
              expressed during embryogenesis<I></I>but silent in the somatic donor 
              cell,<I></I>must be reactivated. This complex process of epigenetic 
              remodeling (i.e., the reconfiguration of the genome by turning on 
              and turning off specific genes) that occurs during gametogenesis 
              in normal development ensures that the genome of the zygote can 
              faithfully activate early embryonic gene expression (Fig 1a; definition 
              of  "epigenetics", see footnote 3). In a cloned embryo, reprogramming, 
              which in normal gametogenesis requires months to years to complete, 
              must occur in a cellular context radically different from gametogenesis 
              and within the short interval (probably within hours) between transfer 
              of the donor nucleus into the egg and the time when zygotic transcription 
              becomes necessary for further development. Given these radically 
              different conditions, one can envisage a spectrum of different outcomes 
              to the reprogramming process ranging from (i) no reprogramming of 
              the genome, resulting in immediate death of the NT embryo; through 
              (ii) partial reprogramming, allowing initial survival of the clones, 
              but resulting in an abnormal phenotype and/or lethality at various 
              stages of development; to (iii) faithful reprogramming producing 
              fully normal animals (Fig 1b). The phenotypes observed over the 
              past five years in cloned embryos and newborns suggest that complete 
              reprogramming is the exception<I>,</I> if it occurs at all. <br>

            <p> <strong>IV. Development of clones depends on the differentiation-state 
              of the donor nucleus </strong><span class="text"></span></p>
            </span><span class="text"></span><span class="text"> 
            <p> The majority of cloned embryos fail at an early step of embryonic 
              development, soon after implantation in the wall of the uterus, 
              an early step of embryonic development <B></B>(Hochedlinger and 
              Jaenisch, 2002b; Rideout et al., 2001). Those that live to birth 
              often display common abnormalities irrespective of the donor cell 
              type (Table 1). In addition to symptoms referred to as "Large Offspring 
              Syndrome"<B>,</B> neonate clones often suffer from respiratory distress 
              and kidney, liver, heart or brain defects (Cibelli et al., 2002). 
              However, the abnormalities characteristic of cloned animals are 
              not inherited by their offspring (Tamashiro et al., 2002), indicating 
              that epigenetic aberrations (i.e., failure of genome reprogramming) 
              rather than genetic aberrations (changes in the sequences within 
              the DNA) are the cause. <span class="text"></span></p>
            </span><span class="text"> 
            <p> The efficiency of creating cloned animals is strongly influenced 
              by the differentiation-state of the donor nucleus (Table 1). In 
              the mouse, for example, only 1-3% of cloned blastocysts derived 
              from somatic donor nuclei, e.g., those prepared from <S></S>fibroblasts 
              or cumulus cells,<B><I></I></B>will develop to adult cloned animals 
              (Hochedlinger and Jaenisch, 2002b). <B> </B> In certain cases, such 
              as those using terminally differentiated B or T cell donor nuclei, 
              <B></B>the efficiency of cloning is so low as to preclude the direct 
              derivation of cloned animals. In stark contrast to these examples, 
              cloning using donor nuclei prepared from embryonic stem (ES) cells 
              is significantly more efficient (between 15 and 30 %, Table 1). 
              This correlation with differentiation-state suggests that embryonic 
              nuclei require less reprogramming of their genome, ostensibly because 
              the genes essential for embryonic development are already active 
              and need not be reprogrammed. In fact, the nucleus of an embryonic 
              cell such as an ES cell may well have the same high efficiency to 
              generate postnatal mice after nuclear transfer as the nucleus prepared 
              from a recently fertilized egg  (Table 1, compare Fig. 4). Nonetheless, 
              most if not all mice that have been cloned from ES cell donor nuclei, 
              in contrast to mice derived through natural fertilization from the 
              zygote, areabnormal, indicating that the processes of gametogenesis 
              (development of sperm and of egg) and fertilization endows the zygote 
              nucleus with the ability to direct <I>normal</I> development. In 
              summary, these data indicate that the potential of a nucleus to 
              generate a normal embryo is lost progressively with development.

              that leads to the demise of most clones just after implantation. 
              Recently, a set of about 70 key embryonic genes termed "Oct-4 like" 
              genes have been identified that are active in early embryos but 
              not in somatic donor cells. Importantly, the failure to faithfully 
              activate this set of genes can be correlated with the frequent death 
              of cloned animals during the immediate post-implantation period 
              (Bortvin et al., 2003). These results define "faulty reprogramming" 
              as the cause of early demise of cloned embryos as the failure to 
              reactivate key embryonic genes that are silent in the donor cell.

            <p> Clones that survive to birth suffer from serious problems, many 
              of which appear to be due to an abnormal placenta. The most common 
              phenotypes observed in animals cloned from either somatic or ES 
              cell nuclei are fetal growth abnormalities such as increased placental 
              and birth weight. This has suggested that surviving clones had accurately 
              reprogrammed the "Oct-4 like" genes that are essential for the earliest 
              stages of development, i.e. those immediately following implantation 
              of the embryo into the uterus. The abnormal phenotype of those clones 
              that do survive through these early stages and develop to birth 
              indicates that other genes that are important for later stages of 
              development but are <B></B>not essential for early survival are 
              not correctly reprogrammed.  To assess the extent of abnormal expression 
              of various genes in the cells of clones, global gene expression 
              has been assessed by microarray analysis of RNA prepared from the 
              placentas and livers of neonatal cloned mice, i.e., clones that 
              survived development and were viable at birth; these clones had 
              been derived by nuclear transfer (NT) of nuclei prepared either 
              from cultured ES cells or from freshly isolated cumulus cells (somatic 
              cells that surround the egg) <B></B>(Humpherys et al., 2002).  Direct 
              comparison of gene expression profiles of over 10,000 genes (of 
              the 30,000 or so in the mammalian genome) showed that for both classes 
              of cloned neonatal mice, approximately 4% of the expressed genes 
              in their placentas differed dramatically in expression levels from 
              those in controls, and that the majority of abnormally expressed 
              genes were common to both types of clones.  When imprinted genes, 
              a class of genes that express only one allele (either from maternal 
              or paternal origin), were analyzed, between 30 and 50% were not 
              correctly activated. These data represent strong molecular evidence 
              that cloned animals, even those that survive to birth, suffer from 
              serious gene expression abnormalities. </p>

            <p>The generation of adult and seemingly healthy adult cloned animals 
              has been taken as evidence that normal cloned animals can be generated 
              by nuclear transfer, albeit with low efficiency. Indeed, a routine 
              physical and clinical laboratory examination of 24 cloned cows of 
              1 to 4 years of age failed to reveal major abnormalities (Lanza 
              et al., 2001). Cloned mice of a corresponding age as that of the 
              cloned cows (2 - 6 months in mice vs. 1 - 4 years in cows) also 
              appear "normal" by superficial inspection. However, when cloned 
              mice were aged, serious problems, not apparent at younger ages, 
              became manifest. One study found that the great majority of cloned 
              mice died significantly earlier than normal mice, succumbing with 
              immune deficiency and serious pathological alterations in multiple 
              organs (Ogonuki et al., 2002). Another study found that aged cloned 
              mice became overweight with major metabolic disturbances (Tamashiro 
              et al., 2002). Thus, serious abnormalities in cloned animals may 
              often become manifest only when the animals age.  </p>
            <span class="text">
            <p> Firm evidence about aging and "normalcy" of cloned farm animals 
              is incomplete or anecdotal because cloned animals of these species 
              are still comparatively young (relative to their respective normal 
              life span). For example, the premature death of Dolly (Giles and 
              Knight, 2003) is entirely consistent with serious abnormalities 
              in cloned sheep that become manifest only at later ages. Also, two 
              of the analyzed cloned cows developed disease soon after the study 
              on "healthy and normal cattle" (Lanza et al., 2001) had appeared: 
              one animal developed an ovarian tumor and another one suffered brain 
              seizures (J. Cibelli, pers. comm.). While it cannot be ruled out 
              that these are "spontaneous" maladies unconnected with the cloning

            <p> It is a key question in the public debate whether it is ever possible 
              to produce a normal individual by nuclear cloning, even if only 
              with low efficiency. The available evidence suggests that it may 
              be difficult if not impossible to produce normal clones for the 
              following reasons: 1) As summarized above, all analyzed clones at 
              birth showed dysregulation of hundreds of genes. The development 
              of clones to birth and beyond despite widespread epigenetic abnormalities 
              suggests that mammalian development can tolerate dysregulation of 
              many genes. 2) Some clones survive to adulthood by compensating 
              for gene dysregulation. Though this "compensation" assures <I>survival</I>, 
              it may not prevent maladies to become manifest at later ages. Therefore, 
              most if not all clones are expected to have at least subtle abnormalities 
              that may not be so severe as to result in an obvious phenotype at 
              birth but will cause serious problems later as seen in aged mice.<B><I></I></B>Clones 
              may just differ in the extent of abnormal gene expression: if the 
              key "Oct-4 like" genes are not activated, clones die immediately 
              after implantation. If those genes are activated, the clone may 
              survive to birth and beyond. </p>
            </span><span class="text"> 
            <p> As schematically shown in Fig. 2, the two stages when the majority 
              of clones fail are immediately after implantation and at birth. 
              These are two critical stages of development that may be particularly 
              vulnerable to faulty gene expression. Once cloned newborns have 
              progressed through the critical perinatal period,  various compensatory 
              mechanisms may counterbalance abnormal expression of other genes 
              that are not essential for the subsequent postnatal survival. However, 
              the stochastic occurrence of disease and other defects at later 
              age in many or most adult clones implies that such compensatory 
              mechanisms do not guarantee "normalcy" of cloned animals. Rather, 
              the phenotypes of surviving cloned animals may be distributed over 
              a wide spectrum from abnormalities causing sudden demise at later 
              postnatal age or more subtle abnormalities allowing survival to 
              advanced age (Fig. 2). These considerations illustrate the complexity 
              of defining subtle gene expression defects and emphasize the need 
              for more sophisticated test criteria such as environmental stress 
              or behavior tests. However, the available evidence suggests that 
              truly normal clones may be the exception. </p>

            </span><span class="text"> 
            <p> A principal biological barrier that prevents clones from being 
              normal is the "epigenetic" difference (such as distinct patterns 
              of DNA methylation, for definition of "methylation", see footnote 
              4) between the chromosomes inherited from mother and from father, 
              i.e. the difference between the "maternal" and the "paternal" genome 
              of an individual. Such methylation of specific DNA sequences is 
              known to be responsible for shutting down the expression of nearby 
              genes.  Parent-specific methylation marks are responsible for the 
              expression of imprinted genes and cause only one copy of an imprinted 
              gene, derived either from sperm or egg, to be active while the other 
              allele is inactive (Ferguson-Smith and Surani, 2001). When sperm 
              and oocyte genomes are combined at fertilization, the parent-specific 
              marks established during oogenesis and spermatogenesis persist in 
              the genome of the zygote (Fig 3A). Of interest for this discussion 
              is that within hours after fertilization<I>,</I> most of the global 
              methylation marks (with the exception of those on imprinted genes) 
              are stripped from the sperm genome whereas the genome of the oocyte 
              is resistant to this active demethylation process (Mayer et al., 
              2000). This is because the oocyte genome is in a different "oocyte-appropriate" 
              epigenetic state than the sperm genome. The oocyte genome becomes 
              only partially demethylated within the next few days by a passive 
              demethylation process. The result of these post-fertilization changes 
              is that the two parental genomes are epigenetically different (as 
              defined by the patterns of DNA methylation) in the later stage embryo 
              and remain so in the adult in imprinted as well as non-imprinted 
              sequences. </p>

            <p> In cloning, the epigenetic differences that are established during 
              gametogenesis may be erased because both parental genomes of the 
              somatic donor cell are introduced into the egg from the outside 
              and are thus exposed equally to the demethylation activity present 
              in the egg cytoplasm (Fig 3B). This predicts that imprinted genes 
              should be particularly vulnerable to inappropriate methylation and 
              associated dysregulation in cloned animals. The results summarized 
              earlier are consistent with this prediction. For cloning to be made 
              safe, the two parental genomes of a somatic donor cell would need 
              to be physically separated and separately treated in an "oocyte-appropriate" 
              and a "sperm-appropriate" way, respectively. At present, it seems 
              that this is the only rational approach to guarantee the creation 
              of the epigenetic differences that are normally established during 
              gametogenesis. Such an approach is beyond our present abilities. 
              These considerations imply that <I>serious biological barriers</I> 
              exist that interfere with faithful reprogramming after nuclear transfer. 
              It is a safe conclusion that these biological barriers represent

              distinction between the goals and the end product of these two technologies. 
              The purpose of reproductive cloning is to generate a cloned embryo 
              that is then implanted in the uterus of a female to give rise to 
              a cloned individual. In contrast, the purpose of nuclear transplantation 
              therapy is to generate an embryonic stem cell line that is derived 
              from a patient (referred to as "ntES cells") and can be used subsequently 
              for tissue replacement. </p>
            </span><span class="text"> 
            <p> Many scientists recognize the potential of NtES cells for organ 
              transplantation (for recent review see (Hochedlinger and Jaenisch, 
              2003). This procedure is currently complicated by immune rejection 
              due to immunological incompatibility. Thus, virtually all organ 
              transplants undertaken at present involve the use of donor organs 
              that are recognized as foreign by the immune systems of the recipient 
              and thus are targeted for destruction by these immune systems. <B> </B> 
              To treat this "host versus graft" disease, immunosuppressive drugs 
              are routinely given to transplant recipients in order to suppress 
              this organ rejection. Such immunosuppressive treatment has serious 
              side effects including increased risks of infections and malignancies.  
              In principle, ES cells can be created from a patient&#39;s nuclei

              and the requirement for immunosuppression are eliminated. Moreover, 
              ES cells provide a renewable source of replacement tissue allowing 
              for repeated therapy whenever needed. Finally, if ES cells are derived 
              from a patient carrying a known genetic defect, the mutation in 
              question can be corrected in the ntES cells using standard gene 
              targeting methods before introducing these ES cells (or derived 
              tissue-specific stem cells) back into the patient&#39;s body. </p>

              experiments, some have concluded that "The experiment failed to 
              show success with therapeutic cloning" (Coalition and Ethics, 2003) 
              and that "This indicates that the only successful therapy using 
              cloned embryos would be through &#39;reproductive&#39; cloning, 
              to produce born clones who can serve as tissue donors for patients" 
              (Prentice, 2002). This is a troubling misinterpretation of the data. 
              (i) It has been shown that ES cell-derived hematopoietic cells can 
              successfully engraft and rescue lethally irradiated mice indicating 
              that increased NK activity is a peculiarity of Rag2-deficiency (Kyba 
              et al., 2002).  Therefore, it would seem that for most diseases, 
              no anti-NK treatment would be required to assure engraftment of 
              ES cell-derived somatic cells. (ii) It is correct that treatment 
              of a human patient with <I>Omenn syndrome,</I> which is equivalent 
              to Rag2 deficiency, by SCNT may also require anti-NK treatment to 
              <I>transiently</I> reduce NK activity. This would allow the transplanted 
              cells to engraft as in the mouse experiment.  Once these cells are 
              successfully engrafted, there is every reason to believe that such 
              anti-NK treatment would no longer be necessary.  <I> </I>   </p>

            <p> As mentioned repeatedly above, embryos can be derived from the 
              fertilized egg or from a somatic nucleus by SCNT. The potential 
              of the resulting blastocyst, when implanted into the womb, to develop 
              into a fetus and a postnatal animal depends strictly on the nature 
              of the <B></B>donor nucleus (Fig 5): (i) When derived from the zygote, 
              most embryos develop to birth and generate a normal animal; (ii) 
              Similarly, most blastocysts cloned from an embryonic stem cell donor 
              nucleus develop to birth but, in contrast to the normally fertilized 
              embryo, the great majority of the cloned animals will be abnormal 
              ("Large offspring syndrome") (Eggan et al., 2001; Humpherys et al., 
              2001); (iii) The great majority of cloned blastocysts derived from 
              somatic donor nuclei such as fibroblasts or cumulus cells will die 
              soon after implantation and only a few clones will survive to birth 
              and these too <B></B>will be abnormal, suffering once again from 
              the Large offspring syndrome (Wakayama and Yanagimachi, 2001); (iv) 
              Finally, the likelihood of cloned blastocysts derived from another 
              type of somatic donor nuclei - those present in terminally differentiated 
              lymphoid cells <B>-</B> to generate a cloned animal is extremely 
              low and has not been achieved except by using a two step procedure 
              involving the intermediate generation of embryonic stem cells (Hochedlinger 
              and Jaenisch, 2002a). These observations suggest that a blastocyst 
              retains an "epigenetic memory" of its donor nucleus. This memory 
              determines its potential for fetal development: while a fertilized 
              embryo develops normally, any embryo derived by SCNT will be abnormal 
              though the efficiency of a given clone to develop to birth is strongly 
              influenced by the differentiation state of the donor cell (see Table 
              1). In other words, the cloned embryo after implantation into the 
              womb will be abnormal because the cloned blastocyst retained an 
              epigenetic memory of its donor nucleus and this causes faulty fetal 
              development. This epigenetic memory is erased when a blastocyst, 
              either derived by nuclear cloning or from the fertilized egg, is 
              explanted into tissue culture and grown into an embryonic stem cell. 
              Erasure of the epigenetic memory has major consequences for the 
              "normalcy" of embryonic stem cells. </p>

              Of the blastocyst cells that are explanted in this way, those that 
              derive from the portion of the blastocyst termed the inner cell 
              mass (ICM) initially express "key" embryonic genes such as Oct-4. 
              However, soon after explantation, most ICM cells extinguish Oct-4 
              expression and cease proliferating (Buehr et al., 2003). Only one 
              or a few of the ICM-derived cells will eventually re-express Oct-4 
              and these few Oct-4-positive cells are those that resume rapid proliferation<B>,</B>

            <p> The important point for this discussion is that the propagation

              of surviving cells that have erased the "epigenetic memory" of the

              have, regardless of donor nuclear origin, an identical developmental 
              potential. In other words, ES cells derived from embryos produced 
              by normal fertilization and those produced from cloned embryos are 
              functionally indistinguishable (Hochedlinger and Jaenisch, 2002b; 
              Rideout et al., 2002; Wakayama et al., 2001). Because the ES cells 
              that derive from normally fertilized embryos are able to participate 
              in the generation of all normal embryonic tissues, we can conclude 
              that the ES cells derived from cloned embryos have a similar potential

            <p> Epigenetic instability appears to be a consistent characteristic 
              of ES cells. This was shown when individual ES cells were analyzed 
              for expression of imprinted genes: even cells in a recently subcloned 
              ES cell line differed strongly in the expression of genes such as 
              H19 or Igf2. The variable expression was correlated withthe DNA 
              methylation status of the genes, which switched from an unmethylated 
              to a methylated state between sister cells (Humpherys et al., 2001). 
              This was a surprising result in view of the known potential of ES 
              cells to generate terminally differentiated cells that function 
              normally after transplantation into an animal. Possible explanations 
              include (i) that epigenetic instability in ES cells is a consequence 
              of propagation of cells in tissue culture or (ii) that epigenetic 
              instability is a prerequisite for cells to be pluripotent, i.e., 
              this instability may be a manifestation of a plasticity in the gene 
              expression program that is required to enable the ES cells to generate

            <p> As outlined above, faulty reprogramming leads to abnormal phenotypes

              reprogramming and epigenetic instability a problem for reproductive 
              cloning but not for therapeutic applications? The main reason for 
              this seeming paradox is that, in contrast to reproductive cloning, 
              the therapeutic application of NT does not require the formation 
              of a fetus. Therapeutic applications involve the ability of cloned 
              ES cells to form a single tissue or organ, not to recapitulate all 
              of fetal development. For example, normal fetal development requires 
              faithful expression of the imprinted genes. As outlined above, nuclear 
              cloning causes between 30% and 50% of imprinted genes to be dysregulated 
              consistent with the notion that disturbed imprinting is a major 
              contributing factor to clone failure. As most imprinted genes have 
              no known function in the postnatal animal, the dysregulation of 
              imprinting would not be expected to impede functionality of <I>in 
              vitro</I> differentiated ES cells because this process does not 
              require the formation of a fetus. Therefore, the functionality of 
              mature cells derived in culture from ES cells would not depend on 
              the faithful reprogramming of the imprinted genes. Dysregulation 
              of some imprinted genes such as <I>Igf2</I> are known, however, 
              to cause disease in the adult. Thus, it will be important to test 
              whether dysregulation of such genes has adverse effects on the function

              technology for tissue therapy in humans is the argument that the 
              procedure involves the destruction of potential human life. From 
              a biological point of view, life begins with fertilization when 
              the two gametes are combined to generate a new embryo that has a 
              unique combination of genes and has a high potential to develop 
              into a normal baby when implanted into the womb. A critical question 
              for the public debate on SCNT is this one: is the cloned embryo 
              equivalent to the fertilized embryo? </p>
            </span><span class="text"> 
            <p> In cloning, the genetic contribution is derived from one individual 
              and not from two. Obviously, the cloned embryo is the product of 
              laboratory-assisted technology, not the product of a natural event. 
              From a biological point of view, nuclear cloning does not constitute 
              the creation of new life, rather the propagation of existing life 
              because no meiosis, genetic exchange and conception are involved. 
              Perhaps more important is, however, the overwhelming evidence obtained 
              from the cloning of seven different mammalian species. As summarized 
              above, the small fraction of cloned animals that survive beyond 
              birth, even if they appear "normal" upon superficial inspection,  
              are likely not so. The important conclusion is that a cloned human 
              embryo would have little if any potential to develop into a normal 
              human being. With other words, the cloned human embryo lacks essential 
              attributes that characterize the beginning of <I>normal</I> human 
              life. </p>

              three potential fates: disposal, generation of normal embryonic 
              stem cells or generation of a normal baby when implanted into the 
              womb. Similarly, the cloned embryo has three potential fates: it 
              can be destroyed or could be used to generate a normal ntES cell 
              line that has the same potential for therapy as an ES cell derived 
              from a fertilized embryo. In contrast to the fertilized embryo, 
              the cloned embryo has little if any potential to ever generate a 
              normal baby.<B><I></I></B>An embryonic stem cell line derived by

            <p>  If SCNT were accepted as a valid therapeutic option, 
              a major concern of its implementation as medical procedure would 
              be the problem of how to obtain sufficient numbers of human eggs 
              that could be used as recipients. Commercial interests may pressure 
              women into an unwanted role as egg donors. The recent demonstration 
              that embryonic stem cells can be coaxed into a differentiation pathway 
              that yields oocyte-like cells (Hubner et al., 2003) may offer a 
              solution to this dilemma. If indeed functional oocytes could be 
              generated from a generic human ES cell line, sufficient eggs could 
              be generated in culture and serve as recipients for nuclear transfer 
              without the need of a human egg donor. It seems that technical issues, 
              not fundamental biological barriers, need to be overcome so that 
              transplantation therapy can be carried out without the use of human 
              oocytes. </p>

            <p> <B>A:</B> The  genomes of oocyte and sperm are differentially 
              methylated during gametogenesis and are different in the zygote 
              when combined at fertilization. Immediately after fertilization 
              the paternal genome (derived from the sperm) is actively demethylated 
              whereas the maternal genome is only partially demethylated during 
              the next few days of cleavage.  This is because the oocyte genome 
              is in a different chromatin configuration and is resistant to the 
              active demethylation process imposed on the sperm genome by the 
              egg cytoplasm. Thus, the methylation of two parental genomes is 
              different at the end of cleavage and in the adult. Methylated sequences 
              are depicted as filled lollipops and unmethylated sequences as empty 
              lollipops. </p>

            <p> 1) <i>Reprogramming:</i> The genome of a somatic cell is in an 
              epigenetic state that is appropriate for the respective tissue and 
              assures the expression of the tissue specific genes (in mammary 
              gland cells, for example, those genes important for mammary gland 
              function such as milk production). In cloning, the somatic nucleus 
              must activate those genes that are needed for embryonic development 
              but which are silent in the donor cell in order for the cloned embryo 
              to survive. The egg cytoplasm contains "reprogramming factors" that 
              can convert the epigenetic state (see footnote 3) characteristic 
              of the somatic donor nucleus to one that is appropriate for an embryonic 
              cell. This process is very inefficient leading to inappropriate 
              expression of many genes and causes most clones to fail early. </p>
            </span><span class="text"> 
            <p> 2) <i>Imprinted genes:</i> For most genes, both copies, the one 
              inherited from father and the one inherited from mother, are expressed. 
              In contrast, only one of the two copies of an imprinted gene, either 
              the maternal one or the paternal one, is active. The two copies 
              are distinguished by methylation marks (see footnote 4) that are 
              imposed on imprinted genes either during oogenesis (maternally imprinted 
              genes) or during spermatogenesis (paternally imprinted genes). Thus, 
              the two copies of imprinted genes are epigenetically different in 
              the zygote and remain so in all somatic cells. These epigenetic 
              marks distinguish the two copies and cause only one copy to be expressed 
              whereas the other copy remains silent. It is estimated that between 
              100 and 200 genes (of the total of 30,000 genes) are imprinted. 
              Disturbances of normal imprinted gene expression lead to growth 
              abnormalities during fetal life and can be the cause of major diseases 
              such as Beckwith-Wiedeman or Prader-Willi syndrome. </p>

            <p> 3) <i>Epigenetic changes</i>: Cells of a multicellular organism 
              are genetically identical but express, depending on the particular 
              cell type, different sets of genes  ("tissue specific genes"). These 
              differences in gene expression arise during development and must 
              be retained through subsequent cell divisions. Stable alterations 
              of this kind are said to be "epigenetic", as they are heritable 
              in the short term (during cell divisions) but do not involve mutations 
              of the DNA itself. </p>
            </span><span class="text"> 
            <p> 4) <i>DNA methylation:</i> Reversible modification of DNA (methylation 
              of the base cytosine) that affects the "readability" of genes: usually, 
              methylated genes are silent and unmethylated genes are expressed. 
              DNA methylation represents an important determinant of the "epigenetic 
              state" of genes and affects the state of the chromatin: methylated 
              regions of the genome are in a "silent" state and unmethylated regions 
              are in an "open" configuration that causes genes to be active. </p>
