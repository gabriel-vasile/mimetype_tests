<div class="FieldValue" ><p>The results of the literature search on the subject of cataract were reviewed by the Cataract and Anterior Segment Panel and used to prepare the recommendations, which they rated in two ways. The panel first rated each recommendation according to its importance to the care process. This &quot;importance to the care process&quot; rating represents care that the panel thought would improve the quality of the patient's care in a meaningful way. The panel also rated each recommendation on the strength of the evidence in the available literature to support the recommendation made.</p></div>

<a name='1289'><h4 class="FieldLbl">COST ANALYSIS</h4>
<div class="FieldValue" ><p>In a study in Sweden and a study in the United States, the hypothetical cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained for cataract extraction in one eye was estimated respectively at US $4,500 and US $2,023. In a US study, the estimated cost per QALY gained for cataract surgery in the second eye was US $2,727 (calculated in 2003). These values for cataract surgery compare favorably with those reported for other ophthalmic procedures (e.g., laser photocoagulation for diabetic macular edema, $3,101; laser photocoagulation for extrafoveal choroidal neovascularization, $23,640).</p>

<p>A review of technological innovation looked at the costs and benefits of several treatments for disease conditions, including heart attack, low birthweight infants, depression, breast cancer, and cataracts. The authors concluded that expansion in treatment for patients operated at much less severe measures of visual acuity than in the past is almost certainly beneficial and that there have been substantial improvements in quality at no cost increase per patient. The present value of cataract surgery was estimated at $95,000, which is much greater than the estimated costs of $2,000 to $3,000. Thus, the benefits of expanded cataract treatment exceed the costs.</p></div>

<a name='1292'><h4 class="FieldLbl">MAJOR RECOMMENDATIONS</h4>
<div class="FieldValue" ><p>Ratings of importance to the care process (A-C) and ratings of strength of evidence (I-III) are defined at the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field.</p>

<p><strong><u>Diagnosis</u></strong></p>

<p>Preoperative visual acuity is a poor predictor of postoperative functional improvement; therefore, the decision to recommend cataract surgery should not be made on the basis of visual acuity alone (Schein et al., 1994; Schein et al., 1995) [A:II].</p>

<p>The patient should be asked specifically about near and distant vision under varied lighting conditions for activities that the patient views as important [A:III].</p>

<p><strong>Ophthalmic Evaluation</strong></p>

<p>The comprehensive evaluation (history and physical examination) includes those components of the comprehensive adult medical eye evaluation (Preferred Practice Patterns Committee, 2005) specifically relevant to the diagnosis and treatment of a cataract as listed below:</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Patient history [A:III], including the patient's assessment of functional status, pertinent medical conditions, medications currently used, and other risk factors that can affect the surgical plan or outcome of surgery (e.g., immunosuppressive conditions, sympathetic alpha-1a antagonists).</li>
<li>Visual acuity with current correction (the power of the present correction recorded) at distance and when appropriate at near. [A:III]</li>
<li>Measurement of best-corrected visual acuity (with refraction when indicated). [A:III]</li>
<li>External examination (lids, lashes, lacrimal apparatus, orbit). [A:III]</li>
<li>Examination of ocular alignment and motility. [A:III]</li>
<li>Assessment of pupillary function. [A:III]</li>
<li>Measurement of intraocular pressure (IOP). [A:III]</li>
<li>Slit-lamp biomicroscopy of the anterior segment. [A:III]</li>
<li>Dilated examination of the lens, macula, peripheral retina, optic nerve, and vitreous. [A:III]</li>

<li>Assessment of relevant aspects of the patient's mental and physical status. [B:III]</li></ul>

<p><strong><u>Management</u></strong></p>

<p><strong>Nonsurgical Management</strong></p>

<p>At the present time, the highest quality evidence does not support a benefit from nutritional supplementation in preventing or delaying progression of cataracts; therefore, treatment with supplements is not recommended. (Huang et al., 2006) [A:I]</p>

<p>Patients who are currently smoking should be informed of the increased risk of cataract progression and the benefits of smoking cessation in retarding the progression of cataracts that have been demonstrated in several studies. (West et al., 1989; Christen et al., 1992; Christen et al., 2000) [A:II] Studies have found that smokers report that a physician's advice to quit is an important motivator in attempting to stop smoking. (National Cancer Institute [NCI], 1994; Ockene, 1987; Pederson, Baskerville &amp; Wanklin, 1982; Ranney et al., 2006). Patients who are long-term users of oral or inhaled corticosteroids should be informed of the increased risk of cataract formation (Garbe, Suissa &amp; Lelorier, 1998; Jick, Vasilakis-Scaramozza &amp; Maier 2001; Klein et al., 2001; Smeeth et al., 2003; Urban &amp; Cotlier, 1986) [A:II] and may wish to discuss alternate medications with their primary care physician. Patients with diabetes mellitus should be informed of their increased risk of cataract formation. (Hennis et al., 2004; Klein, Klein &amp; Lee, 1998; Leske et al., 1999) [A:II]. Brimmed hats and ultraviolet-B blocking sunglasses are reasonable precautions to recommend to patients. (McCarty, Nanjan &amp; Taylor, 2000).</p>

<p><strong>Surgical Management</strong></p>

<p><em>Indications for Surgery</em></p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>The primary indication for surgery is visual function that no longer meets the patient's needs and for which cataract surgery provides a reasonable likelihood of improved vision. [A:III]</li>
<li>Other indications for a cataract removal include the following:

<ul type="disc">
<li>Clinically significant anisometropia in the presence of a cataract. [A:III]</li>
<li>The lens opacity interferes with optimal diagnosis or management of posterior segment conditions. [A:III]</li>
<li>The lens causes inflammation (phacolysis, phacoanaphylaxis). [A:III]</li>
<li>The lens induces angle closure (phacomorphic or phacotopic). [A:III]</li></ul>
</li></ul>

<p>The ophthalmologist who is to perform the cataract surgery has the following responsibilities:</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>To examine the patient preoperatively (see &quot;Ophthalmic Evaluation&quot; above). [A:III]</li>
<li>To ensure that the evaluation accurately documents the symptoms, findings, and indications for treatment. [A:III]</li>
<li>To obtain informed consent from the patient or the patient's surrogate decision maker after discussing the risks, benefits, and expected outcomes of surgery, including anticipated refractive outcome and the surgical experience. [A:III]</li>
<li>To review the results of presurgical and diagnostic evaluations with the patient or the patient's surrogate decision maker. [A:III]</li>
<li>To formulate a surgical plan, including selection of an appropriate intraocular lens (IOL). [A:III]</li>
<li>To formulate postoperative care plans and inform the patient or the patient's surrogate decision maker of these arrangements (setting of care, individuals who will provide care). [A:III]</li>
<li>To afford the patient or the patient's surrogate decision maker the opportunity to discuss the costs associated with surgery. [B:III]</li></ul>

<p>All patients undergoing cataract surgery should have a history and physical examination relevant to the risk factors for undergoing the planned anesthesia and sedation and as directed by a review of systems. [A:III] For patients with certain severe systemic diseases (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, recent myocardial infarction, unstable angina, poorly controlled diabetes, or poorly controlled blood pressure) a preoperative medical evaluation by the patient's physician should be strongly considered. (Lee et al., 1999). [A:II] Laboratory testing as indicated by the findings in the history and physical examination is appropriate. (Schein, et al., 2000) [A:I].</p>

<p>Given the lack of evidence for an optimal anesthesia strategy during cataract surgery, the type of anesthesia management should be determined by the patient's needs and the preferences of the patient and surgeon. (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [AHRQ], 2000) [A:II].</p>

<p>Use of a 5% solution of povidone iodine in the conjunctival cul de sac is recommended to prevent infection. (Speaker &amp; Menikoff, 1991; Wu et al., 2006) [A:II].</p>

<p>Further management recommendations can be found in the main body of the original guideline document.</p>

<p><em>Postoperative Follow-up</em></p>

<p>The frequency of postoperative examinations is based on the goal of optimizing the outcome of surgery and swiftly recognizing and managing complications. The table below provides guidelines for follow-up based on consensus in the absence of evidence for optimal follow-up schedules.</p>

<p><strong>Table. Postoperative Follow-up Schedule [A:III]</strong></p>

<p>Patients should be instructed to contact the ophthalmologist promptly if they experience symptoms such as a significant reduction in vision, increasing pain, progressive redness, or periocular swelling, because these symptoms may indicate the onset of endophthalmitis [A:III].</p>

<p>In the absence of complications, the frequency and timing of subsequent postoperative visits depend largely on the size or configuration of the incision; the need to cut or remove sutures; and when refraction, visual function, and the medical condition of the eye are stabilized. More frequent postoperative visits are generally indicated if unusual findings, symptoms, or complications occur, and the patient should have ready access to the ophthalmologist's office to ask questions or seek care [A:III].</p>

<p>Components of each postoperative examination should include: [A:III]</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Interval history, including use of postoperative medications, new symptoms, and self-assessment of vision</li>
<li>Measurement of visual function (e.g., visual acuity, pinhole testing)</li>
<li>Measurement of intraocular pressure (IOP)</li>
<li>Slit-lamp biomicroscopy</li>
<li>Counseling/education for the patient or patient's caretaker</li>
<li>Management plan</li></ul>

<p>A final refractive visit should be made to provide an accurate prescription for spectacles to allow for the patient's optimal visual function [A:III].</p>

<p><strong><u>Provider and Setting</u></strong></p>

<p>It is the unique role of the ophthalmologist who performs cataract surgery to confirm the presence of the cataract and to formulate and carry out a treatment plan [A:III]. The surgical facility should comply with standards governing the particular setting of care (e.g., the Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care, Inc., Joint Commission for Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, American Hospital Association) [A:III].</p>

<p><strong><u>Counseling/Referral</u></strong></p>

<p>Patients with functionally limiting postoperative visual impairment should be referred for vision rehabilitation (American Academy of Ophthalmology [AAO], 2001) and social services [A:III].</p>

<li><strong>Cataract Surgery</strong>: Major complications that are potentially sight-threatening include infectious endophthalmitis, intraoperative suprachoroidal hemorrhage, cystoid macular edema (CME), retinal detachment, corneal edema, and intraocular lens dislocation</li>

<li><strong>Intraocular Lenses (IOL)</strong>: The most common reasons for IOL explantation include incorrect power, opacification, decentration or dislocation, and glare or optical aberrations. A rare late complication of IOL implantation is uveitis-glaucoma-hyphema syndrome.</li>

<li><strong>Anesthesia</strong>: Anesthesia techniques with needle injection may be associated with complications such as strabismus, globe perforation, retrobulbar hemorrhage, and macular infarction not seen with topical, blunt cannula, and other non-needle injection techniques.</li>

<li><strong>Nd:YAG (Neodymium: Yttrium-Aluminum-Garnet) laser</strong>: Complications of Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy include transient and long-term increased intraocular pressure (IOP), retinal detachment, CME, damage to the intraocular lens (IOL), hyphema, dislocation of the IOL, and corneal edema and corneal abrasions from using a focusing contact lens for the laser surgery. Axial myopia increases the risk of retinal detachment after Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy, as does pre-existing vitreoretinal disease, male gender, young age, vitreous prolapse into the anterior chamber, and spontaneous extension of the capsulotomy.</li>

<li><strong>Ocular Comorbidities</strong>: High-risk characteristics include a history of previous eye surgery, special types of cataracts, very large and very small eyes, deeply set eyes, eyes with small pupils or posterior synechiae, eyes with scarred or cloudy corneas, eyes with weak or absent zonules, prior ocular trauma, and the systemic use of alpha-1a antagonists.</li></ul></div>

<li><strong>Preferred Practice Patterns provide guidance for the pattern of practice, not for the care of a particular individual</strong>. While they should generally meet the needs of most patients, they cannot possibly best meet the needs of all patients. Adherence to these Preferred Practice Patterns will not ensure a successful outcome in every situation. These practice patterns should not be deemed inclusive of all proper methods of care or exclusive of other methods of care reasonably directed at obtaining the best results. It may be necessary to approach different patients' needs in different ways. The physician must make the ultimate judgment about the propriety of the care of a particular patient in light of all of the circumstances presented by that patient. The American Academy of Ophthalmology is available to assist members in resolving ethical dilemmas that arise in the course of ophthalmic practice.</li>

<li><strong>Preferred Practice Patterns are not medical standards to be adhered to in all individual situations</strong>. The Academy specifically disclaims any and all liability for injury or other damages of any kind, from negligence or otherwise, for any and all claims that may arise out of the use of any recommendations or other information contained herein.</li>
