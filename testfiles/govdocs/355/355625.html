[Docket No. 2004N-0527]

 
Medical Devices; Medical Device Reporting

AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS.

ACTION: Direct final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or we) is amending its 
regulation governing reporting of deaths, serious injuries, and certain 
malfunctions related to medical devices. We are revising the regulation 
into plain language to make the regulation easier to understand, and we 
are making technical corrections. Elsewhere in this issue of the 
Federal Register, we are publishing a companion proposed rule, under 
FDA's usual procedures for notice and comment, to provide a procedural 
framework to finalize the rule in the event we receive any significant 
adverse comment and withdraw the direct final rule.

DATES: This rule is effective July 13, 2005, with the exception of 21 
CFR 803.55(b)(9) and (b)(10) and 21 CFR 803.58, which remain stayed 
indefinitely, in accordance with the stays of effective date published 
in the Federal Registers of July 31, 1996 (61 FR 39868), and July 23, 
1996 (61 FR 38346). Submit written or electronic comments by May 16, 
2005. If we receive no significant adverse comments within the 
specified comment period, we intend to publish a document confirming 
the effective date of the final rule in the Federal Register within 30 
days after the comment period on this direct final rule ends. If we 
receive any timely significant adverse comment, we will withdraw this 
final rule in part or in whole by publication of a document in the 
Federal Register within 30 days after the comment period ends.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. What Is the Background of This Rule?

    FDA's regulations governing device adverse event reporting, 
codified at part 803 (21 CFR part 803), implement section 519 of the 
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 360i). That 
statutory provision has undergone several changes since its enactment 
as part of the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 (the 1976 amendments) 
(Public Law 94-295). As a result, FDA's regulations at part 803 have 
also undergone multiple revisions.
    In the Federal Register of September 14, 1984 (49 FR 36326), FDA 
first issued final medical device reporting (MDR) regulations (part 
803) under section 519 of the act for manufacturers and importers, 
requiring reports of deaths, serious injuries, and certain malfunctions 
involving devices.
    To address shortcomings in the 1976 amendments, and to better 
protect the public health by ensuring more complete reporting of 
device-related adverse events, Congress enacted the Safe Medical 
Devices Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-629), which amended the statute to 
add requirements for medical device user facilities and distributors to 
report certain device-related adverse events. The reporting regulation 
for user facilities and for

[[Page 9517]]

distributors became effective by operation of law on May 28, 1992, 
following the November 26, 1991 (56 FR 60024), publication of those 
requirements in a tentative final rule. This regulation required user 
facilities to report deaths to FDA and to manufacturers, and to report 
serious illnesses and injuries to manufacturers, or to FDA if the 
manufacturer was unknown. Distributors were required to report deaths 
and serious illnesses or injuries to FDA and to manufacturers, and to 
report certain malfunctions to manufacturers. Existing reporting 
requirements for manufacturers and importers under the 1984 regulation 
remained in effect.
    In the Federal Register of September 1, 1993 (58 FR 46514), we 
published a notice confirming that the distributor reporting regulation 
had become final and was codified in part 804 (21 CFR part 804). 
Earlier, on June 16, 1992, the President signed into law the Medical 
Device Amendments of 1992 (the 1992 amendments) (Public Law 102-112) 
further amending certain provisions of section 519 of the act relating 
to reporting of adverse device events. Among other things, the 1992 
amendments modified the requirements for manufacturer and importer 
reporting. Consequently, under the regulation issued September 1, 1993, 
importers were required to report as manufacturers if they were engaged 
in manufacturing activities or to report as distributors if they were 
engaged solely in distribution activities.
    On November 21, 1997, the President signed the Food and Drug 
Administration Modernization Act (FDAMA) (Public Law 105-115) into law. 
FDAMA made several changes regarding the reporting of adverse 
experiences related to devices. In the Federal Register of May 12, 
1998, FDA published a direct final rule (63 FR 26069) and a companion 
proposed rule (63 FR 26129) to implement new amendments to the MDR 
provisions. We received significant adverse comments on the 1998 direct 
final rule and 1998 companion proposed rule; therefore, we withdrew the 
1998 direct final rule and issued a revised final rule on January 26, 
2000 (65 FR 4112). Under the act as amended by FDAMA, distributors are 
no longer required to report adverse events but are required to keep 
records. Importers are still required to report adverse events related 
to medical devices. Because of FDAMA's changes, we revised part 803 and 
rescinded part 804.
    In summary, the present version of part 803, as it is codified in 
the Code of Federal Regulations, imposes the following general 
reporting and recordkeeping requirements:
    Device user facilities must report deaths and serious injuries that 
a device has or may have caused or contributed to, establish and 
maintain adverse event files, and submit annual reports. Manufacturers 
and importers must report deaths and serious injuries that a device has 
or may have caused or contributed to, must report certain device 
malfunctions, and must establish and maintain adverse event files. 
Manufacturers also must submit specified followup and baseline reports. 
Distributors must maintain records of incidents but are not required to 
report these incidents.

II. What Does This Direct Final Rulemaking Do?

A. What Is the General Approach?

    In this direct final rule, FDA does not change the existing 
regulatory requirements described previously in this document. FDA is 
revising part 803 solely to ensure that despite the many revisions that 
have been made, part 803 is clear and easy to understand. To achieve 
this goal, we have rewritten part 803 into plain language, in 
accordance with the Presidential Memorandum on Plain Language, issued 
on June 1, 1998. That memorandum directed the agency to ensure that all 
of its documents are clear and easy to read. Part of achieving that 
goal involves having readers of a regulation feel that it is speaking 
directly to them. Therefore, we have attempted to incorporate plain 
language in this rule as much as possible. We have tried to make each 
section of the companion proposed rule easy to understand by using 
clear and simple language rather than jargon, by keeping sentences 
short, and by using active voice rather than passive voice whenever 
possible. We have also made changes to improve the consistency of the 
format and language used throughout parallel regulations governing user 
facilities, importers, and manufacturers that were added or amended at 
different times. We do not intend these changes to have any effect on 
the substantive requirements of part 803.

B. What Are Some Specific Changes Implemented by This Direct Final 
Rule?

    We believe the majority of the plain language revisions to part 803 
require no explanation, but we highlight some specific changes made to 
particular provisions in the following paragraphs:
    <bullet> In Sec.  803.1, we have described the scope of the 
regulation in relation to each of the types of entities that it 
covers--user facilities, manufacturers, importers, and distributors--to 
reflect more accurately the requirements established in the subsequent 
sections.
    <bullet> In Sec.  803.9(c), we have rephrased the regulation to 
state that we will delete the identity of a device user facility which 
makes a report under this part, except in specifically named 
circumstances. This change is a clearer expression of the underlying 
statutory prohibition on disclosure, found in section 519(d)(2) of the 
act, and reflects the agency's existing practice.
    <bullet> In Sec.  803.20(b)(1) and (b)(3), we have substituted the 
term ``work day'' for ``day'' in computing the time requirements for 
filing certain reports. This change clarifies that these regulations 
are congruent with section 519(b)(1)(A) of the act, which specifies 
that user facility reports be made within 10 ``working days'' and with 
Sec.  803.53, which is cross-referenced by Sec.  803.20(b)(3)(iii) and 
also specifies ``work days.'' We also changed ``day'' to ``work day'' 
in Sec.  803.10(c)(2).
    <bullet> In Sec.  803.20(c)(1), we have rewritten the regulation to 
highlight examples of the types of information that may reasonably 
suggest that a reportable event has occurred. This is consistent with 
the intent of the regulation as explained in the Federal Register of 
December 11, 1995 (60 FR 63578).
    <bullet> In Sec.  803.40(b), which describes importer requirements 
regarding reports of malfunctions, we have reworded the regulation to 
add the term ``reasonably suggests'' to the description of the 
information that triggers a reporting requirement. This addition more 
accurately reflects the underlying statutory language of section 
519(a)(1) of the act and is consistent with existing FDA interpretation 
of this regulation.
    <bullet> In Sec.  803.55(a)(1), we have changed terminology and 
inserted a cross-reference to part 807 (21 CFR part 807) to clarify 
that where an MDR is reported by a manufacturing site that is not 
registered as an establishment under part 807, and therefore does not 
have an existing establishment registration number, we will assign a 
number to be used in MDR reporting until such time as that site is 
registered and assigned a number under part 807. These changes are 
consistent with FDA's existing interpretation of and practice under 
this regulation. (See also 60 FR 63586.)
    We note that Sec. Sec.  803.55(b)(9) and (b)(10) and 803.58 were 
stayed indefinitely, under notices published in the Federal Registers 
of July 31, 1996 (61 FR 39868 at 39869) and July 23, 1996 (61 FR 38346 
at 38347). This direct final rule does not implement any changes to 
those provisions, which

[[Page 9518]]

remain stayed indefinitely, but for the sake of completeness, we 
include as follows the current text of those provisions.
    In addition to the plain language revisions made throughout part 
803, we have made technical corrections in three provisions. In Sec.  
803.3, in the definition of ``user facility report number,'' we have 
replaced references to the Health Care Financing Administration with 
references to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, to 
reflect the change in name of that agency. In Sec.  803.11, we have 
updated contact information regarding sources where forms may be 
obtained. In Sec.  803.22(b), we have changed an erroneous reference to 
reports ``required under this section'' to a correct reference to 
reports ``required under this part.''

III. What Are the Procedures for Issuing a Direct Final Rule?

    In the Federal Register of November 21, 1997 (62 FR 62466), FDA 
described when and how it will employ direct final rulemaking. We 
believe that this rule is appropriate for direct final rulemaking 
because it is intended to make noncontroversial amendments to an 
existing regulation, rewriting existing regulations into clearer 
language and format without altering their substance, and making two 
technical corrections. We anticipate no significant adverse comment.
    Consistent with FDA's procedures on direct final rulemaking, we are 
publishing elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register a companion 
proposed rule to amend certain existing regulations governing reporting 
of medical device adverse events. The companion proposed rule is 
identical to the direct final rule. The companion proposed rule 
provides a procedural framework within which the rule may be finalized 
in the event the direct final rule is withdrawn because of any 
significant adverse comment. The comment period for this direct final 
rule runs concurrently with the comment period of the companion 
proposed rule. Any comments received under the companion proposed rule 
will also be considered as comments regarding this direct final rule.
    If we receive any significant adverse comment, we intend to 
withdraw this final rule by publication of a document in the Federal 
Register within 30 days after the comment period ends. A significant 
adverse comment is defined as a comment that explains why the rule 
would be inappropriate, including challenges to the rule's underlying 
premise or approach, or would be ineffective or unacceptable without 
change. In determining whether a significant adverse comment is 
sufficient to terminate a direct final rulemaking, we will consider 
whether the comment raises an issue serious enough to warrant a 
substantive response in a notice-and-comment process. Comments that are 
frivolous, insubstantial, or outside the scope of the rule will not be 
considered significant or adverse under this procedure. For example, a 
comment recommending an additional change to the rule will not be 
considered a significant adverse comment, unless the comment states why 
the rule would be ineffective without the additional change. In 
addition, if a significant adverse comment applies to part of a rule 
and that part can be severed from the remainder of the rule, we may 
adopt as final those parts of the rule that are not the subject of a 
significant adverse comment.
    If we withdraw the direct final rule, all comments received will be 
considered under the companion proposed rule in developing a final rule 
under the usual notice-and-comment procedures under the Administrative 
Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 552 et seq.). If we receive no significant 
adverse comment during the specified comment period, we intend to 
publish a confirmation document in the Federal Register within 30 days 
after the comment period ends. We intend to make the direct final rule 
effective July 13, 2005.

IV. What Is the Legal Authority for This Rule?

    This direct final rule, like the existing medical device adverse 
event reporting regulations to which it makes nonsubstantive changes, 
is authorized by sections 502, 510, 519, 520, 701, and 704 of the the 
act (21 U.S.C. 352, 360, 360i, 360j, 371, and 374).

V. What Is the Environmental Impact of This Rule?

    We have determined under 21 CFR 25.30(h) and (i) that this action 
does not have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, 
neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact 
statement is required.

VI. What Is the Economic Impact of This Rule?

    We have examined the impacts of this direct final rule under 
Executive Order 12866, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-
612), and the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Public Law 104-4). 
Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits 
of available regulatory alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, 
to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including 
potential economic, environmental, public health and safety, and other 
advantages, distributive impacts, and equity). We believe that this 
direct final rule is not a significant regulatory action under the 
Executive order.
    The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires agencies to analyze 
regulatory options that would minimize any significant impact of a rule 
on small entities. Because this direct final rule will not change any 
existing requirements or impose any new requirements, we certify that 
this direct final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small entities.
    Section 202(a) of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 requires 
that agencies prepare a written statement, which includes an assessment 
of anticipated costs and benefits, before proposing ``* * * any rule 
that includes any Federal mandate that may result in the expenditure by 
State, local, and tribal governments in the aggregate, or by the 
private sector, of $100,000,000 or more (adjusted annually for 
inflation) in any one year.'' The current threshold after adjustment 
for inflation is $115 million, using the most current (2003) Implicit 
Price Deflator for the Gross Domestic Product. FDA does not expect this 
final rule to result in any 1-year expenditure that would meet or 
exceed this amount.

VII. How Does the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 Apply to This Rule?

    This final rule contains information collection provisions that are 
subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under 
the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (the PRA) (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520). 
The collections of information addressed in the direct final rule have 
been approved by OMB in accordance with the PRA under the regulations 
governing medical device reporting (part 803, OMB control number 0910-
0437).

VIII. What Are the Federalism Impacts of This Rule?

    We have analyzed this final rule in accordance with the principles 
set forth in Executive Order 13132. We have determined that the rule 
does not contain policies that have substantial direct effects on the 
States, on the relationship between the National Government and the 
States, or on the distribution of power and

[[Page 9519]]

responsibilities among the various levels of government. Accordingly, 
we have concluded that the rule does not contain policies that have 
federalism implications as defined in the Executive order and, 
consequently, a federalism summary impact statement is not required.

IX. How Do You Submit Comments on This Rule?

    Interested persons may submit to the Division of Dockets Management 
(see ADDRESSES) written or electronic comments regarding this direct 
final rule. Submit a single copy of electronic comments or two paper 
copies of any mailed comments, except that individuals may submit one 
paper copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found 
in brackets in the heading of this document. Received comments may be 
seen in the Division of Dockets Management between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., 
Monday through Friday.

Subpart A--General Provisions


Sec.  803.1  What does this part cover?

    (a) This part establishes the requirements for medical device 
reporting for device user facilities, manufacturers, importers, and 
distributors. If you are a device user facility, you must report deaths 
and serious injuries that a device has or may have caused or 
contributed to, establish and maintain adverse event files, and submit 
summary annual reports. If you are a manufacturer or importer, you must 
report deaths and serious injuries that your device has or may have 
caused or contributed to, you must report certain device malfunctions, 
and you must establish and maintain adverse event files. If you are a 
manufacturer, you must also submit specified followup and baseline 
reports. These reports help us to protect the public health by helping 
to ensure that devices are not adulterated or misbranded and are safe 
and effective for their intended use. If you are a medical device 
distributor, you must maintain records (files) of incidents, but you 
are not required to report these incidents.
    (b) This part supplements and does not supersede other provisions 
of this chapter, including the provisions of part 820 of this chapter.
    (c) References in this part to regulatory sections of the Code of 
Federal Regulations are to chapter I of title 21, unless otherwise 
noted.


Sec.  803.3  How does FDA define the terms used in this part?

    Some of the terms we use in this part are specific to medical 
device reporting and reflect the language used in the statute (law). 
Other terms are more general and reflect our interpretation of the law. 
This section defines the following terms as used in this part:
    Act means the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 301 
et seq., as amended.
    Ambulatory surgical facility (ASF) means a distinct entity that 
operates for the primary purpose of furnishing same day outpatient 
surgical services to patients. An ASF may be either an independent 
entity (i.e., not a part of a provider of services or any other 
facility) or operated by another medical entity (e.g., under the common 
ownership, licensure, or control of an entity). An ASF is subject to 
this regulation regardless of whether it is licensed by a Federal, 
State, municipal, or local government or regardless of whether it is 
accredited by a recognized accreditation organization. If an adverse 
event meets the criteria for reporting, the ASF must report that event 
regardless of the nature or location of the medical service provided by 
the ASF.
    Become aware means that an employee of the entity required to 
report has acquired information that reasonably suggests a reportable 
adverse event has occurred.
    (1) If you are a device user facility, you are considered to have 
``become aware'' when medical personnel, as defined in this section, 
who are employed by or otherwise formally affiliated with your 
facility, obtain information about a reportable event.
    (2) If you are a manufacturer, you are considered to have become 
aware of an

[[Page 9520]]

event when any of your employees becomes aware of a reportable event 
that is required to be reported within 30 calendar days or that is 
required to be reported within 5 work days because we had requested 
reports in accordance with Sec.  803.53(b). You are also considered to 
have become aware of an event when any of your employees with 
management or supervisory responsibilities over persons with 
regulatory, scientific, or technical responsibilities, or whose duties 
relate to the collection and reporting of adverse events, becomes 
aware, from any information, including any trend analysis, that a 
reportable MDR event or events necessitates remedial action to prevent 
an unreasonable risk of substantial harm to the public health.
    (3) If you are an importer, you are considered to have become aware 
of an event when any of your employees becomes aware of a reportable 
event that is required to be reported by you within 30 days.
    Caused or contributed means that a death or serious injury was or 
may have been attributed to a medical device, or that a medical device 
was or may have been a factor in a death or serious injury, including 
events occurring as a result of:
    (1) Failure;
    (2) Malfunction;
    (3) Improper or inadequate design;
    (4) Manufacture;
    (5) Labeling; or

    (iii) Device classification and product code.
    (2) You may consider devices that differ only in minor ways not 
related to safety or effectiveness to be in the same device family. 
When grouping products in device families, you may consider factors 
such as brand name and common name of the device and whether the 
devices were introduced into commercial distribution under the same 
510(k) or premarket approval application (PMA).
    Device user facility means a hospital, ambulatory surgical 
facility, nursing home, outpatient diagnostic facility, or outpatient 
treatment facility as defined in this section, which is not a 
physician's office, as defined in this section. School nurse offices 
and employee health units are not device user facilities.
    Distributor means any person (other than the manufacturer or 
importer) who furthers the marketing of a device from the original 
place of manufacture to the person who makes final delivery or sale to 
the ultimate user, but who does not repackage or otherwise change the 
container, wrapper, or labeling of the device or device package. If you 
repackage or otherwise change the container, wrapper, or labeling, you 
are considered a manufacturer as defined in this section.
    Expected life of a device means the time that a device is expected 
to remain functional after it is placed into use. Certain implanted 
devices have specified ``end of life'' (EOL) dates. Other devices are 
not labeled as to their respective EOL, but are expected to remain 
operational through activities such as maintenance, repairs, or 
upgrades, for an estimated period of time.

facilities. A hospital may be either independent (e.g., not a part of a 
provider of services or any other facility) or may be operated by 
another medical entity (e.g., under the common ownership, licensure, or 
control of another entity). A hospital is covered by this regulation 
regardless of whether it is licensed by a Federal, State, municipal or 
local government or whether it is accredited by a recognized 
accreditation organization. If an adverse event meets the criteria for 
reporting, the hospital must report that event regardless of the nature 
or location of the medical service provided by the hospital.
    Importer means any person who imports a device into the United 
States and who furthers the marketing of a device from the original 
place of manufacture to the person who makes final delivery or sale to

and intended to be used as is, or are processed by a licensed 
practitioner or other qualified person to meet the needs of a 
particular patient; or
    (4) Is the U.S. agent of a foreign manufacturer.
    Manufacturer or importer report number. Manufacturer or importer 
report number means the number that uniquely identifies each individual 
adverse event report submitted by a manufacturer or importer. This 
number consists of the following three parts:
    (1) The FDA registration number for the manufacturing site of the 
reported device, or the registration number for the importer. If the 
manufacturing site or the importer does not have an establishment 
registration number, we will assign a temporary MDR reporting number 
until the site is registered in accordance with part 807 of this 
chapter. We will inform the manufacturer or importer of the temporary 
MDR reporting number;
    (2) The four-digit calendar year in which the report is submitted; 
and
    (3) The five-digit sequence number of the reports submitted during

treatment facility must report that event regardless of the nature or 
location of the medical service provided by the outpatient treatment 
facility.
    Patient of the facility means any individual who is being diagnosed 
or treated and/or receiving medical care at or under the control or 
authority of the facility. This includes employees of the facility or 
individuals affiliated with the facility who, in the course of their 
duties, suffer a device-related death or serious injury that has or may 
have been caused or contributed to by a device used at the facility.
    Physician's office means a facility that operates as the office of 
a physician or other health care professional for the primary purpose 
of examination, evaluation, and treatment or referral of patients. 
Examples of physician offices include dentist offices, chiropractor 
offices, optometrist offices, nurse practitioner offices, school nurse 
offices, school clinics, employee health clinics, or freestanding care 
units. A physician's office may be independent, a group practice, or 
part of a Health Maintenance Organization.
    Remedial action means any action other than routine maintenance or 
servicing of a device where such action is necessary to prevent 
recurrence of a reportable event.

    (2) Results in permanent impairment of a body function or permanent 
damage to a body structure, or
    (3) Necessitates medical or surgical intervention to preclude 
permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body 
structure.
    Permanent means irreversible impairment or damage to a body 
structure or function, excluding trivial impairment or damage.
    Shelf life means the maximum time a device will remain functional 
from the date of manufacture until it is used in patient care. Some 
devices have an expiration date on their labeling indicating the 
maximum time they can be stored before losing their ability to perform 
their intended function.
    User facility report number means the number that uniquely 
identifies each report submitted by a user facility to manufacturers 
and to us. This number consists of the following three parts:
    (1) The user facility's 10-digit Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 
Services (CMS) number (if the CMS number has fewer than 10 digits, fill 
the remaining spaces with zeros);
    (2) The four-digit calendar year in which the report is submitted; 
and
    (3) The four-digit sequence number of the reports submitted for the 
year, starting with 0001. (For example, a complete user facility report 
number will appear as follows: 1234560000-2004-0001. If a user facility 
has more than one CMS number, it must select one that will be used for 
all of its MDR reports. If a user facility has no CMS number, it should 
use all zeros in the appropriate space in its initial report (e.g., 
0000000000-2004-0001). We will assign a number for future use and send 
that number to the user facility. This number is used in our record of 
the initial report, in subsequent reports, and in any correspondence 
with the user facility. If a facility has multiple sites, the primary 
site may submit reports for all sites and use one reporting number for 
all sites if the primary site provides the name, address, and CMS 
number for each respective site.)
    Work day means Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.

device, whichever is greater. You must maintain copies of these records 
for this period even if you no longer distribute the device.
    (3) You must maintain the device complaint files established under 
this section at your principal business establishment. If you are also 
a manufacturer, you may maintain the file at the same location as you 
maintain your complaint file under part 820 of this chapter. You must 
permit any authorized FDA employee, at all reasonable times, to access, 
to copy, and to verify the records required by this part.
    (e) If you are a manufacturer, you may maintain MDR event files as 
part of your complaint file, under part 820 of this chapter, if you 
prominently identify these records as MDR reportable events. We will 
not consider your submitted MDR report to comply with this part unless 
you evaluate an event in accordance with the quality system 
requirements described in part 820 of this chapter. You must document 
and maintain in your MDR event files an explanation of why you did not 
submit or could not obtain any information required by this part, as 
well as the results of your evaluation of each event.


Sec.  803.19  Are there exemptions, variances, or alternative forms of 
adverse event reporting requirements?

    (a) We exempt the following persons from the adverse event 
reporting requirements in this part:
    (1) A licensed practitioner who prescribes or administers devices 
intended for use in humans and manufactures or imports devices solely 
for use in diagnosing and treating persons with whom the practitioner 
has a ``physician-patient'' relationship;
    (2) An individual who manufactures devices intended for use in 
humans solely for this person's use in research or teaching and not for 
sale. This includes any person who is subject to alternative reporting 
requirements under the investigational device exemption regulations 
(described in part 812 of this chapter), which require reporting of all 
adverse device effects; and
    (3) Dental laboratories or optical laboratories.
    (b) If you are a manufacturer, importer, or user facility, you may 
request an exemption or variance from any or all of the reporting 
requirements in this part. You must submit the request to us in 
writing. Your request must include information necessary to identify 
you and the device; a complete statement of the request for exemption, 
variance, or alternative reporting; and an explanation why your request 
is justified.
    (c) If you are a manufacturer, importer, or user facility, we may 
grant in writing an exemption or variance from, or alternative to, any 
or all of the reporting requirements in this part and may change the 
frequency of reporting to quarterly, semiannually, annually or other 
appropriate time period. We may grant these modifications in response 
to

[[Page 9524]]

your request, as described in paragraph (b) of this section, or at our 
discretion. When we grant modifications to the reporting requirements, 
we may impose other reporting requirements to ensure the protection of 
public health.
    (d) We may revoke or modify in writing an exemption, variance, or 
alternative reporting requirement if we determine that revocation or 
modification is necessary to protect the public health.
    (e) If we grant your request for a reporting modification, you must 
submit any reports or information required in our approval of the 
modification. The conditions of the approval will replace and supersede 
the regular reporting requirement specified in this part until such 
time that we revoke or modify the alternative reporting requirements in 
accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.

Subpart B--Generally Applicable Requirements for Individual Adverse 
Event Reports


Sec.  803.20  How do I complete and submit an individual adverse event 
report?

    (a) What form must I complete and submit? There are two versions of 
the MEDWATCH form for individual reports of adverse events. If you are 
a health professional or consumer, you may use the FDA Form 3500 to 
submit voluntary reports regarding FDA-regulated products. If you are a 
user facility, importer, or manufacturer, you must use the FDA Form 
3500A to submit mandatory reports about FDA-regulated products.
    (1) If you are a user facility, importer, or manufacturer, you must 
complete the applicable blocks on the front of FDA Form 3500A. The 
front of the form is used to submit information about the patient, the 
event, the device, and the ``initial reporter'' (i.e., the first person 
or entity who reported the information to you).
    (2) If you are a user facility, importer, or manufacturer, you must 
complete the applicable blocks on the back of the form. If you are a 
user facility or importer, you must complete block F. If you are a 
manufacturer, you must complete blocks G and H. If you are a 
manufacturer, you do not have to recopy information that you received 
on a Form 3500A unless you are copying the information onto an 
electronic medium. If you are a manufacturer and you are correcting or 
supplying information that is missing from another reporter's Form 
3500A, you must attach a copy of that form to your report form. If you 
are a manufacturer and the information from another reporter's Form 
3500A is complete and correct, you may fill in the remaining 
information on the same form and submit it to us.
    (b) To whom must I submit reports and when?
    (1) If you are a user facility, you must submit MDR reports to:
    (i) The manufacturer and to us no later than 10 work days after the 
day that you become aware of information that reasonably suggests that 
a device has or may have caused or contributed to a death; or
    (ii) The manufacturer no later than 10 work days after the day that 
you become aware of information that reasonably suggests that a device 
has or may have caused or contributed to a serious injury. If the 
manufacturer is not known, you must submit this report to us.
    (2) If you are an importer, you must submit MDR reports to:
    (i) The manufacturer and to us, no later than 30 calendar days 
after the day that you become aware of information that reasonably 
suggests that a device has or may have caused or contributed to a death 
or serious injury; or
    (ii) The manufacturer, no later than 30 days calendar after 
receiving information that a device you market has malfunctioned and 
that this device or a similar device that you market would be likely to 
cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction 
were to recur.
    (3) If you are a manufacturer, you must submit MDR reports to us:
    (i) No later than 30 calendar days after the day that you become 
aware of information that reasonably suggests that a device may have 
caused or contributed to a death or serious injury; or
    (ii) No later than 30 calendar days after the day that you become 
aware of information that reasonably suggests a device has 
malfunctioned and that this device or a similar device that you market 
would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if 
the malfunction were to recur; or
    (iii) Within 5 work days if required by Sec.  803.53.
    (c) What kind of information reasonably suggests that a reportable 
event has occurred?
    (1) Any information, including professional, scientific, or medical 
facts, observations, or opinions, may reasonably suggest that a device 
has caused or may have caused or contributed to an MDR reportable 
event. An MDR reportable event is a death, a serious injury, or, if you 
are a manufacturer or importer, a malfunction that would be likely to 
cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction 
were to recur.
    (2) If you are a user facility, importer, or manufacturer, you do 
not have to report an adverse event if you have information that would 
lead a person who is qualified to make a medical judgment reasonably to 
conclude that a device did not cause or contribute to a death or 
serious injury, or that a malfunction would not be likely to cause or 
contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur. Persons 
qualified to make a medical judgment include physicians, nurses, risk 
managers, and biomedical engineers. You must keep in your MDR event 
files (described in Sec.  803.18) the information that the qualified 
person used to determine whether or not a device-related event was 
reportable.


Sec.  803.21  Where can I find the reporting codes for adverse events 
that I use with medical device reports?

    (a) The MEDWATCH Medical Device Reporting Code Instruction Manual 
contains adverse event codes for use with FDA Form 3500A. You may 
obtain the coding manual from CDRH's Web site at <A HREF="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&log=linklog&to=http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/mdr/373.html">http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/mdr/373.html</A>
; and from the Division of Small Manufacturers, 

International, and Consumer Assistance, Center for Devices and 
Radiological Health, 1350 Piccard Dr., Rockville, MD 20850, FAX: 301-
443-8818, or e-mail to <A HREF="mailto:DSMICA@CDRH.FDA.GOV">DSMICA@CDRH.FDA.GOV</A>.
    (b) We may sometimes use additional coding of information on the 
reporting forms or modify the existing codes. If we do make 
modifications, we will ensure that we make the new coding information 
available to all reporters.


Sec.  803.22  What are the circumstances in which I am not required to 
file a report?

    (a) If you become aware of information from multiple sources 
regarding the same patient and same reportable event, you may submit 
one medical device report.
    (b) You are not required to submit a medical device report if:
    (1) You are a user facility, importer, or manufacturer, and you 
determine that the information received is erroneous in that a device-
related adverse event did not occur. You must retain documentation of 
these reports in your MDR files for the time periods specified in Sec.  
803.18.
    (2) You are a manufacturer or importer and you did not manufacture 
or import the device about which you have adverse event information. 
When you receive reportable event information in error, you must 
forward this information to us with a cover letter

[[Page 9525]]

explaining that you did not manufacture or import the device in 
question.

until you register your reporting site in accordance with part 807. We 
will inform you of the temporary MDR reporting number;
    (2) FDA registration number of each site where you manufacture the 
device;
    (3) Name, complete address, and telephone number of the individual

    (4) Product identification, including device family, brand name, 
generic name, model number, catalog number, product code, and any other 
product identification number or designation;
    (5) Identification of any device that you previously reported in a 
baseline report that is substantially similar (e.g., same device with a 
different model number, or same device except for cosmetic differences 
in color or shape) to the device being reported. This includes 
additional identification of the previously reported device by model 
number, catalog number, or other product identification, and the date 
of the baseline report for the previously reported device;
    (6) Basis for marketing, including your 510(k) premarket 
notification number or PMA number, if applicable, and whether the 
device is currently the subject of an approved postmarket study under 
section 522 of the act;
    (7) Date that you initially marketed the device and, if applicable, 
the date on which you stopped marketing the device;
    (8) Shelf life of the device, if applicable, and expected life of 
the device;
    (9) The number of devices manufactured and distributed in the last 
12 months and an estimate of the number of devices in current use; and
    (10) Brief description of any methods that you used to estimate the 
number of devices distributed and the number of devices in current use. 
If this information was provided in a previous baseline report, in lieu 
of resubmitting the information, it may be referenced by providing the 
date and product identification for the previous baseline report.


Sec.  803.56  If I am a manufacturer, in what circumstances must I 
submit a supplemental or followup report and what are the requirements 
for such reports?

    If you are a manufacturer, when you obtain information required 
under this part that you did not provide because it was not known or 
was not available when you submitted the initial report, you must 
submit the supplemental information to us within 1 month of the day 
that you receive this information. On a supplemental or followup 
report, you must:
    (a) Indicate on the envelope and in the report that the report 
being submitted is a supplemental or followup report. If you are using 
FDA form 3500A, indicate this in Block Item H-2;
    (b) Submit the appropriate identification numbers of the report 
that you are updating with the supplemental information (e.g., your 
original manufacturer report number and the user facility or importer 
report number of any report on which your report was based), if 
applicable; and
    (c) Include only the new, changed, or corrected information in the 
appropriate portion(s) of the respective form(s) for reports that cross 
reference previous reports.
