Sec. 173.150  Milk-clotting enzymes, microbial.

    Milk-clotting enzyme produced by pure-culture fermentation process 
may be safely used in the production of cheese in accordance with the 
following prescribed conditions:
    (a) Milk-clotting enzyme is derived from one of the following 
organisms by a pure-culture fermentation process:
    (1) Endothia parasitica classified as follows: Class, Ascomycetes; 
order, Sphaeriales; family, Diaporthacesae; genus, Endothia; species, 
parasitica.
    (2) Bacillus cereus classified as follows: Class, Schizomycetes; 
order, Eubacteriales; family, Bacillaceae; genus, Bacillus; species, 
cereus (Frankland and Frankland).
    (3) Mucor pusillus Lindt classified as follows: Class, Phycomycetes; 
subclass, Zygomycetes; order, Mucorales; family, Mucoraceae; genus, 
Mucor; species, pusillus; variety, Lindt.
    (4) Mucor miehei Cooney et Emerson classified as follows: Class, 
Phycomycetes; subclass, Zygomycetes; order, Mucorales; family, 
Mucoraceae; genus, Mucor; species, miehei; variety, Cooney et Emerson.
    (5) Aspergillus oryzae modified by recombinant deoxyribonucleic 
(DNA) techniques to contain the gene coding for aspartic proteinase from 
Rhizomucor miehei var. Cooney et Emerson as defined in paragraph (a)(4) 
of this section, and classified as follows: Class, Blastodeuteromycetes 
(Hyphomycetes); order, Phialidales (Moniliales); genus, Aspergillus; 
species oryzae.
    (b) The strains of organism identified in paragraph (a) of this 
section are nonpathogenic and nontoxic in man or other animals.
    (c) The additive is produced by a process that completely removes 
the generating organism from the milk-clotting enzyme product.
    (d) The additive is used in an amount not in excess of the minimum 
required to produce its intended effect in the production of those 
cheeses for which
