            This research project provided various habitats at different stages 
            of maturity and tested and compared the 
            econometrics and ecological effectiveness of various random spatial 
            pattern densities that may be utilized in future restoration 
            projects.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman">Dr. Carolyn Keiffer of Miami 
            University conducted the research to investigate the most 
            effective density of seedlings and saplings for restoring forest 
            ecosystems at the Fernald site. Researchers analyzed vegetation of 
            existing Fernald woodlots to establish a baseline and profile of the 
            existing local vegetation. From this information, they identified 
            the species for experimental plots and evaluated the following 
            planting densities to determine the optimal target density for 
            establishing native forest cover:</font></p>

            </ul>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman">Researchers will monitor the growth 
          and survivability of the various tree species over a 5-year period.</font></p>
            <p><b>Research Findings<br>
            </b>The number of volunteer recruits is about the same in each of 
          the different planting plots and many are 
          invasive species. These findings seem to indicate that sapling-only 
          planting strategies may not adequately address understory conditions. 
          Future restoration designs need to account for shrub and seedling 
          plantings in order to establish a native understory within restored 
          areas.</p>
            <p>Also, tree seedlings responded differently to the use of 
          protective tree tubes. Plastic tubing was installed on approximately 
          one third of seedlings planted in the vegetation plots to evaluate the 
          effects of deer browsing.&nbsp;While browsing has not yet appeared to be 
          an issue, the use of tubes does appear to influence seedling survival. 
          Black walnut and Ohio buckeye seedlings had higher rates of survival 
          without the use of tree tubes; however, hackberry and green ash 
          seedlings had higher rates of survival with tree tubes.</p>
            <p>Lastly, deer rub data of saplings planted within the vegetation 
          plots indicates that deer prefer certain species to others. In the 
          fall of 1999, researchers found that deer preferred to rub green ash 
          and chinquapin oak saplings to the other three species.</p>

            </b>
            </font>DOE's cleanup plan for the Fernald site involves extensive soil 
            excavation, which leaves behind nutrient-poor soil for reclamation. 
            This research project provided information to 
            establish vegetation in disturbed areas of the site.</p>
            <p>Dr. Don Geiger of the University of Dayton conducted this 
            research to determine the optimal strategy for re-vegetating prairie 
            grasses on areas at the Fernald site where topsoil was excavated to 
            achieve site cleanup goals. Researchers evaluated native 
            prairie grass species and various techniques of soil preparation, 
            seeding, mulching and management to establish stable prairie 
            vegetation. Experimental design included testing various soil 
            amendments (topsoil, sewage sludge, wood chips and manure) and 
            planting and mulching regimes.&nbsp; Researchers  used specific 
            measurements during monitoring, including biomass, percent cover and 
            species diversity.</p>
            <p><b>Research Findings</b><br>
            Research findings indicated that woodchip mulch cover 
            provides the optimal conditions for establishing native grasses on 
            excavated areas.&nbsp;Soil amendments did not appear to influence the 
            rate of establishment.&nbsp;In fact, composted sewage sludge 
            actually increased the amount of weed establishment within the 
            research plots.</p>
            <p><b><font color="#008000" face="Times New Roman" size="4"><a name="3.">3.</a> American Chestnut
        Restoration<br>
            </font></b>The goal of this research project was to restore healthy American 
            chestnut trees and increase public awareness about the risks of severe damage 
            to American chestnut trees 
            associated with the spread of invasive plants and pathogens to 
            prevent accidental introductions.</p>
            <p>Dr. Carolyn Keiffer of Miami University  conducted this 
            research to reestablish a population of blight-resistant American 
            chestnut trees at the Fernald site. DOE signed a germplasm and 
            maintenance agreement to obtain approximately 300 hybrid seeds 
            (which are seven-eights pure American chestnut) from the American 
            Chestnut Foundation. During the first year of this project (1998), 
            researchers cultivated the seedlings in a Miami University 
            greenhouse along with 50 pure American chestnut (<i>Castanea dentata</i>) 
            seedlings and 50 Chinese chestnut (<i>Castanea mollissima</i>) 
            seedlings, which serve as a control.&nbsp;While in the green house, most 
            of the seedlings were infected with a fungus unrelated to the 
            chestnut blight. Miami University obtained additional seeds to 
            conduct this research.</p>
            <p>In 1999, researchers planted a combination of hybrid seedlings 
            and seeds in a half-acre plot on the Fernald site.&nbsp;They also 
            planted several Chinese chestnut seedlings along with the hybrids 
            for comparison purposes. This plot was protected from deer grazing 
            by a deer fence. Once the trees grow to a diameter of about 
            1-centimeter, they will be exposed to the chestnut blight (<i>Endothia 
            parasitica</i>) in the field.</p>
            <p>Over the next 30 years, researchers will monitor individual trees 
            for shape, growth characteristics, shade tolerance and resistance to 
            <i>Endothia parasitica</i>.&nbsp; Measurement parameters include survivability, 
            incidence of chestnut infection, and growth (i.e., stem diameter). When surviving trees begin to produce nuts, Fernald will turn over 
            the nuts to the American Chestnut Foundation.&nbsp;The chestnut plot is 
            visible (though not accessible) to the public. Interpretive signs 
            near the chestnut grove denote the importance of this species.</p>

            </font></b>This research project  demonstrated the optimal method(s) for controlling invasive plant species, and  evaluated 
            the feasibility of re-vegetating an area previously dominated by 
            invasive species.</p>
            <p>Dr. Brian McCarthy of Ohio University  conducted this research 
            project to identify invasive plant species and evaluate control 
            methods to use during ecological restoration at the Fernald site.&nbsp;Researchers conducted the first stage of this research in 1998 and 
            1999, which involved identifying prevalent invasive and indigenous 
            plant species on site. The primary invasive species identified were amur honeysuckle (<i>Lonicera macii</i>) and multiflora rose (<i>Rosa 
            multiflora</i>).</p>
            <p>Researchers used this information to establish an experimental 
            design to evaluate the effectiveness of seedling planting against 
            various invasive species removal methods and to evaluate deer 
            browsing effects. In the spring of 1999, researchers developed eight 
            replicates of three treatment plots in a wooded portion of the site, 
            as follows:&nbsp;</p>

                    <li><b>Control</b>: maintain existing honeysuckle and plant 60

                </tr>
              </table>
              <p>Half of the planted seedlings were protected with a tree tube. 
          Researchers  monitored these plots over a 4-year period to evaluate 
          tree seedling growth, their survival against each treatment and the 
          rates of native and invasive plant volunteering within the plots. 
          Evaluation  consisted of biometric (control efficacy, invasive species 
              return, native vegetation return, diversity, seedling growth and 
              survival) and econometric (time, money, cost-benefit) data.</p>
              <p><b>Research Findings</b><br>
              A complete management plan for the control of inventoried invasive 
              plant species at the Fernald site will facilitate large-scale 
              planting efforts during ecological restoration.&nbsp; Researchers  found that the EZ-Ject lance is effective in 
          eradicating amur honeysuckle and multiflora&nbsp; rose.&nbsp;Laborers can 
          inject herbicide directly into the invasive shrub more efficiently 
          than the conventional “lop and squirt” method, where shrubs are cut at 
          the stump and then sprayed with herbicide to prevent resprouting.&nbsp; 
              Data also indicated that control of invasive species benefits the 
          establishment of native species.&nbsp;Seedling survival of all planted 
          species was higher in treated plots than in control plots.</p>
