Abstract

A method was developed to uniformly and systematically induce
saprolegniasis in channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus. Three different methods
for inducing saprolegniasis were evaluated in waters containing known
zoospore concentrations of Saprolegnia parasitica (1) low-temperature shock
to induce immunosuppression: (2) physical abrasion stress; and (3) a
combination of both low temperature shock and abrasion stress.
Low-temperature shock or abrasion stress alone were not effective for
inducing saprolegniasis. Only 10% of fish stressed by low-temperature shock
alone became infected. No fish receiving abrasion stress treatments alone
became infected even though these fish were subject to significant abrasion
and dewatering stress. A combination of low-temperature and abrasion stress,
however, was sufficient to induce saprolegniasis in 100% of fish tested and
resulted in 90% mortality. No fish became infected in the positive control
group (exposed to zoospores of S. Parasitica without stress) or in the negative
control group. The combined-stress method should enable researchers to
induce saprolegniasis in channel catfish at will to study its pathogenesis or to
test the efficacy of candidate antifungal treatments. In conducting efficacy
studies, therapeutic treatments must begin immediately when the first signs of
saprolegniasis are observed because the disease progresses quickly and is
deadly.
