 I.  INTRODUCTION 
 1.  In  this  C  Block  Fourth  Report  and  Order,  we  resolve  the  Commission's  proposals  in  its  C  Block  Further  Notice  of  Proposed  Rule  Making  ("  C  Block  Further  Notice").  1  In  so  doing,  we  set  forth 
 the  rules  that  will  govern  reauctions  of  C  block  spectrum  surrendered  to  the  Commission  pursuant  to  the  C  Block  Second  Report  and  Order  2  and  the  C  Block  Order  on  Reconsideration  of  the  Second  Report  and 
 Order  ("  C  Block  Reconsideration  Order"),  3  as  well  as  any  other  C  block  spectrum  available  for  reauction.

 Communications  Services  (PCS)  Licensees,  WT  Docket  No.  97-  82,  Second  Report  and  Order  and  Further  Notice  of  Proposed  Rule  Making,  12  FCC  Rcd  16,436  ("  C  Block  Second  Report  and  Order"  and  "C  Block  Further 


 Notice").  The  Commission  received  14  comments,  11  reply  comments  and  one  ex  parte  filing  in  response  to  the  C  Block  Further  Notice.  Appendix  A  contains  a  list  of  full  and  abbreviated  names  of  commenting  parties.

 Communications  Services  (PCS)  Licensees,  WT  Docket  No.  97-  82,  Second  Report  and  Order  and  Further  Notice  of  Proposed  Rule  Making,  12  FCC  Rcd  16,436  ("  C  Block  Second  Report  and  Order"  and  "C  Block  Further 


 Notice"). 
 3  Amendment  of  the  Commission's  Rules  Regarding  Installment  Payment  Financing  For  Personal 
 Communications  (PCS)  Licensees,  WT  Docket  No.  97-  82,  Order  on  Reconsideration  of  the  Second  Report  and  Order,  13  FCC  Rcd  8345  (1988)  ("  C  Block  Reconsideration  Order").  We  have  received  11  petitions  for 


 reconsideration  and  clarification  of  the  C  Block  Reconsideration  Order.  See  Petitions  for  Reconsideration  and  Clarification  of  Action  in  Rulemaking  Proceedings,  Report  No.  2283,  63  Fed.  Reg.  38,404  (July  16,  1998).

 eligibility  in  the  initial  C  block  auctions  to  entrepreneurs  and  small  businesses.  5  The  C  block  auction  concluded  on  May  6,  1996,  6  and  the  subsequent  reauction  of  defaulted  licenses  concluded  on  July  16, 
 1996,  7  with  a  total  of  90  bidders  winning  493  licenses.  The  winning  bidders  were  permitted  to  pay  90  percent  of  their  net  bid  price  over  the  ten-  year  license  term.  8 


 3.  The  Commission  decided  in  the  C  Block  Second  Report  and  Order  (as  modified  by  the  C  Block  Reconsideration  Order)  to  allow  each  C  block  licensee  to  elect  one  of  four  options  for  each  of  its 
 licenses:  resumption  of  payments  under  the  licensee's  original  installment  payment  plan,  disaggregation,  amnesty,  or  prepayment.  The  array  of  choices  was  intended  to  provide  limited  relief  to  financially 
 troubled  licensees  without  harming  the  integrity  of  the  auction  process.  9  The  Commission  required  C  block  licensees  to  file  a  written  election  notice,  specifying  whether  they  would  resume  payments  under 
 the  terms  of  the  original  installment  payment  plan  or  would  proceed  under  one  of  the  alternative  options.  10  Included  with  the  C  Block  Second  Report  and  Order  was  the  C  Block  Further  Notice,  in  which 
 the  Commission  sought  comment  on  proposed  changes  to  the  C  block  rules  to  govern  the  reauction  of  surrendered  spectrum  in  the  C  block.  11  The  Wireless  Telecommunications  Bureau  (the  "Bureau") 
 announced  by  public  notice  on  April  17,  1998  an  election  date  of  June  8,  1998  and  a  payment  resumption  date  for  C  block  licensees  of  July  31,  1998.  12

 11  Second  Report  and  Order,  12  FCC  Rcd  at  16,437  para.  1.  The  language  of  the  C  Block  Second  Report  and 
 Order  suggests  that  there  will  be  a  single  C  block  reauction;  however,  for  reasons  discussed  below,  we  now  anticipate  that  there  could  be  more  than  one  reauction.

 4.  On  December  31,  1997,  we  released  the  Part  1  Third  Report  and  Order  in  which  we  adopted  general  competitive  bidding  rules  to  supplant,  wherever  practicable,  auction  rules  that  were 
 specific  to  each  auctionable  service  or  class  of  service.  13  Our  purpose  was  to  streamline  competitive  bidding  regulations,  eliminate  unnecessary  rules,  and  increase  the  overall  efficiency  and  consistency  of 
 the  auction  process.  14  In  the  process,  we  resolved  many  of  the  issues  that  had  been  raised  in  the  C  Block  Further  Notice.  15  Accordingly,  future  C  block  reauctions  will  adhere  to  Part  1  rules,  16  as  amended,  to  the 
 extent  applicable.  Where  our  rules  in  Part  1  are  not  determinative,  bidders  will  continue  to  look  to  Part  24  rules,  17  as  amended  in  this  C  Block  Fourth  Report  and  Order. 


 III.  LICENSES  TO  BE  REAUCTIONED 
 A.  Background 
 5.  In  the  C  Block  Further  Notice,  the  Commission  proposed  that  it  reauction:  (1)  all  licenses  representing  C  block  spectrum  returned  pursuant  to  the  disaggregation,  prepayment,  or  amnesty 
 options;  and  (2)  all  C  block  licenses  held  as  a  result  of  defaults.  18  The  Commission  believed  that  including  all  available  licenses  in  a  reauction  would  allow  it  fairly  and  efficiently  to  facilitate  the  rapid 
 provision  of  service  to  the  public  and  also  would  allow  for  the  most  efficient  aggregation  of  licenses.  19

 6.  We  adopt  the  Commission's  proposal  in  the  C  Block  Further  Notice  to  reauction  all  available  C  block  licenses  held  by  the  Commission.  Several  commenters  agree,  and  no  commenter 
 disagrees,  with  this  proposal.  20  Our  recent  modifications  to  the  C  block  payment  options  in  the  C  Block  Reconsideration  Order  provide  no  reason  to  deviate  from  this  basic  approach.  Any  C  block  license  that 
 becomes  available  for  reauction  after  the  next  C  block  reauction  will  be  reauctioned  in  a  subsequent  reauction  as  soon  as  practicable. 


 7.  NatTel,  Starcom,  and  CPCSI  argue  that  the  next  reauction  should  include  licenses  owned  by  entities  that  have  filed  for  bankruptcy  protection.  21  CPCSI  maintains  that  if  licenses  held  by  C  block 
 bankruptcy  petitioners  are  excluded  from  the  next  reauction,  the  uncertainty  surrounding  the  fate  of  those  licenses  will  make  business  planning  difficult  for  other  C  block  entities.  22  NatTel  urges  the  Commission 
 to  amend  its  rules  in  order  to  be  able  to  revoke  automatically  the  licenses  of  licensees  that  have  declared  bankruptcy.  23 


 8.  In  the  Part  1  Third  Report  and  Order,  we  addressed  the  issue  of  whether  the  Commission  can  immediately  reclaim  and  reauction  licenses  held  by  a  licensee  that  declares  bankruptcy.  24  As  we 
 stated  there,  we  are  confident  of  our  position  that  the  Commission  can  reclaim  licenses  quickly  since  the  Commission  conditions  licenses  upon  payment  and  requires  automatic  cancellation  in  the  event  of 
 nonpayment.  25  Nevertheless,  until  controlling  precedent  is  established  by  the  courts,  or  legislation  addressing  conflicting  rights  is  enacted,  a  delay  in  the  reauction  of  licenses  in  bankruptcy  litigation  may 
 occur.  26  The  pendency  of  bankruptcy  proceedings  involving  certain  C  block  licenses  27  makes  it

 impossible  for  us  to  resolve  at  this  time  whether  those  licenses  will  be  available  in  the  next  C  block  reauction.  We  do  not  intend,  however,  to  delay  a  reauction  of  other  available  C  block  licenses  because  of 
 such  litigation.  Such  a  delay  easily  could  become  the  first  in  an  interminable  series  of  delays,  undermining  our  primary  goal  of  getting  licenses  into  the  hands  of  parties  that  will  provide  service  to  the 
 public  and  competition  in  the  market.  For  this  reason,  we  believe  that  the  public  will  realize  a  greater  benefit  if  we  auction  all  available  C  block  spectrum  as  soon  as  practicable  than  it  will  if  we  postpone  a 
 reauction  until  we  have  resolved  all  issues  connected  with  every  bankruptcy  proceeding.  Licenses  made  available  in  any  bankruptcy  proceeding  will  be  included  in  the  next  appropriate  reauction. 


 9.  CPCSI  asks  that  the  Commission  also  address  the  issue  of  whether  a  reauction  will  additionally  encompass  licenses,  such  as  those  won  by  CPCSI,  that  are  the  subject  of  petitions  pending 
 before  the  Commission.  28  Because  the  Commission  granted  CPCSI's  application  for  review  on  December  24,  1997,  29  and  granted  its  license  applications  on  December  29,  1997,  30  CPCSI's  request  is  moot  as  to  the 
 licenses  at  issue  in  its  application  for  review.  The  decision  will  be  made  on  a  case  by  case  basis  whether  to  include  in  a  reauction  any  other  C  block  licenses  held  by  the  Commission  that  are  the  subject  of 
 pending  Commission  or  judicial  proceedings.

 IV.  ELIGIBILITY  FOR  PARTICIPATION 
 A.  Background 
 10.  In  the  C  Block  Second  Report  and  Order,  the  Commission  decided  that  the  public  interest  considerations  mandated  by  Section  309(  j)  of  the  Communications  Act  31  would  be  furthered  by  applying 
 to  a  C  block  reauction  the  same  eligibility  rules  that  had  been  used  for  the  original  C  block  auction.  32  The  Commission,  therefore,  deemed  eligible  to  participate  in  a  C  block  reauction:  (1)  all  applicants 
 qualifying,  as  of  the  start  of  the  reauction,  as  entrepreneurs  under  the  Commission's  rules;  33  and  (2)  all  entities  that  had  filed  a  short-  form  application  (FCC  Form  175)  to  participate  in,  and  had  been  eligible  to 
 participate  in,  the  original  C  block  auction.  34  Accordingly,  the  Commission  decided  that  all  entities  that  had  participated  in  the  original  C  block  auction  would  be  eligible  to  participate  in  the  next  reauction; 
 however,  the  Commission  prohibited  C  block  licensees  that  return  spectrum  pursuant  to  the  disaggregation  or  prepayment  options  from  reacquiring  their  returned  spectrum  for  a  period  of  two  years 
 from  the  start  date  of  the  next  C  block  reauction.  35  This  prohibition  extended  to  qualifying  members  of  the  licensee's  control  group,  and  their  affiliates.  36 


 11.  In  the  C  Block  Further  Notice,  the  Commission  sought  comment  on  whether  it  should  restrict  participation  in  the  C  block  reauction  to  entities  that  have  not  defaulted  on  any  payments  owed  the 
 Commission.  37  The  Commission  asked  for  comment  on  possible  alternatives  to  excluding  defaulters  from  participation  in  a  reauction.  One  possibility  was  for  the  Commission  to  have  an  expedited  hearing  on  a 
 winning  defaulter's  financial  qualifications,  allowing  the  defaulter  to  attempt  to  rebut  a  presumption  that  it  is  not  financially  qualified.  38  Another  idea  was  for  the  Commission  to  require  defaulters  to  submit  either 
 more  detailed  financial  information  at  the  application  stage  or  a  larger  upfront  payment.  39  The  Commission  observed  that  C  block  licensees  would  not  be  in  default  simply  by  virtue  of  having  elected 
 the  alternative  payment  options  established  in  the  C  Block  Second  Report  and  Order.  40

 12.  In  the  C  Block  Reconsideration  Order,  we  modified  the  alternative  payment  options  to,  inter  alia,  divide  the  amnesty  option  into  two  categories:  "pure  amnesty"  and  "amnesty/  prepayment."  41 
 We  decided  that,  while  licensees  returning  spectrum  pursuant  to  the  "pure  amnesty"  option  would  not  be  prohibited  from  reacquiring  their  returned  spectrum,  licensees  returning  spectrum  pursuant  to  the 
 "amnesty/  prepayment"  option  would  have  to  forgo,  for  a  period  of  two  years  from  the  start  date  of  next  C  block  reauction,  eligibility  to  reacquire  their  spectrum.  42  This  prohibition  extends  to  qualifying  members 
 of  a  licensee's  control  group,  and  their  affiliates.  43  In  addition,  we  retained  the  two-  year  prohibition  on  the  reacquisition  of  spectrum  returned  pursuant  to  the  disaggregation  or  prepayment  options  established  in 
 the  C  Block  Second  Report  and  Order.  44  We  also  responded  to  petitions  for  reconsideration  of  the  C  Block  Second  Report  and  Order  filed  by  Cellexis  International,  Inc.  and  RFW  PCS  Inc.,  both  of  which 
 disagree  with  comments  filed  by  Nextel  in  response  to  the  C  Block  Further  Notice.  45  As  discussed  below,  Nextel  asks  that  the  Commission  open  eligibility  for  a  reauction  to  "all  qualified  bidders."  We  disagreed 
 with  Nextel's  proposal,  affirming  the  Commission's  ruling  in  the  C  Block  Second  Report  and  Order  to  limit  eligibility  for  participation  in  C  block  reauctions  to  applicants  meeting  the  Commission's  definition 
 of  entrepreneur.  46

 No  application  is  acceptable  for  filing  and  no  license  shall  be  granted  for  frequency  block  C  or  frequency  block  F,  unless  the  applicant,  together  with  its  affiliates  and  persons  or  entities  that  hold  interests 
 in  the  applicant  and  their  affiliates,  have  gross  revenues  of  less  than  $125  million  in  each  of  the  last  two  years  and  total  assets  of  less  than  $500  million  at  the  time  the  applicant's  short-  form

 13.  We  retain  the  C  block  eligibility  parameters  established  in  the  C  Block  Second  Report  and  Order.  The  following  entities  will  be  eligible  for  C  block  reauctions:  (1)  entities  that  filed  an  FCC 
 Form  175  short-  form  application  for,  and  were  eligible  for,  the  original  C  block  auction  and  (2)  entities  qualifying  as  entrepreneurs  under  Section  24.709  of  the  Commission's  rules,  as  of  the  deadline  for  the 
 filing  of  short-  form  applications  for  the  reauction.  47  While,  under  these  rules,  entities  that  participated  in  the  original  C  block  reauction  will  be  eligible  for  C  block  reauctions,  we  retain  the  eligibility  restriction 
 established  in  the  C  Block  Second  Report  and  Order,  as  modified  in  the  C  Block  Reconsideration  Order,  for  licensees  that  surrender  licenses  pursuant  to  the  disaggregation,  prepayment,  and/  or 
 "amnesty/  prepayment"  options.  Such  licensees  will  be  ineligible  to  reacquire  their  surrendered  licenses  through  reauction  or  by  any  other  means  for  a  period  of  two  years  from  the  start  date  of  the  next  C  block 
 reauction.  48 
 14.  The  Commission's  decision  in  the  C  Block  Second  Report  and  Order  to  impose  a  two-year  bar  on  the  eligibility  of  licensees  to  reacquire  licenses  they  return  pursuant  to  the  disaggregation  and 
 prepayment  options  sparked  comment.  NextWave  wants  all  licensees  to  be  permitted  to  participate  in  a  reauction,  regardless  of  their  election  of  an  alternative  payment  option.  49  Sprint,  on  the  other  hand,  urges 
 the  Commission  to  bar  licensees  electing  the  amnesty  option  from  bidding  on  their  surrendered  spectrum  in  a  reauction.  50  We  dealt  with  the  respective  concerns  of  NextWave  and  Sprint  in  the  C  Block 
 Reconsideration  Order.  51  As  we  stated  there,  we  believe  that  the  modified  approach  we  adopted  in  that  order  addresses  the  concerns  of  both  of  these  parties.  52  Therefore,  we  affirm  the  decision  we  made  in  that 
 order.  Starcom  asks  that  the  qualifications  of  licensees  electing  any  of  the  alternative  payment  options  be  subjected  to  a  higher  level  of  scrutiny  regarding  their  financial  qualification  to  deal  with  the  requirements 
 of  additional  licenses.  53  We  believe  that  a  higher  level  of  scrutiny  is  not  warranted.  As  noted  above,  C  block  licensees  that  have  elected  alternative  payment  options  are  not  defaulters.  54  Moreover,  all 
 applicants  for  C  block  reauctions  will  be  required  to  pay  a  substantial  upfront  payment,  which  should  help  ensure  that  only  serious,  qualified  bidders  participate.  55

 15.  Because  we  are  not  planning  to  include  C  block  licenses  that  remain  involved  in  bankruptcy  proceedings  in  the  next  C  block  reauction,  56  there  likely  will  be  more  than  one  reauction  for  C 
 block.  Accordingly,  we  must  evaluate  whether  to  allow  applicants  for  and  participants  in  the  original  C  block  auction  to  remain  eligible  to  participate  in  all  future  C  block  reauctions,  regardless  of  whether  they 
 still  qualify  as  entrepreneurs  under  the  Commission's  rules  at  the  deadline  for  filing  a  short-  form  application.  While  we  believe  that  flexibility  in  this  regard  is  appropriate,  we  believe  that  fairness  to 
 other  future  bidders  prevents  our  providing  an  open  eligibility  standard  indefinitely.  Consequently,  in  order  to  be  eligible  for  any  C  block  reauction  that  begins  more  than  two  years  from  the  start  date  of  the 
 next  C  block  reauction,  an  applicant  must  qualify  as  an  entrepreneur  under  the  Commission's  rules  at  the  time  of  filing  its  short-  form  application.  57 


 16.  Several  parties  commented  on  the  eligibility  rules  established  in  C  Block  Second  Report  and  Order,  with  most  commenters  supporting  the  Commission's  decision.  58  As  mentioned,  however, 
 Nextel  urges  the  Commission  not  to  limit  a  reauction  just  to  entrepreneurs  but  rather  to  allow  "all  qualified  bidders"  to  participate.  59  Nextel  argues  that  a  restricted  auction  skews  the  marketplace  and  that 
 the  increasing  level  of  competition  in  the  wireless  arena  makes  it  less  likely  that  small  business  entrepreneurs  can  survive.  60  According  to  Nextel,  the  Commission  could  enable  small  businesses  to  bid 
 competitively  by  providing  them  bidding  credits  and  permitting  them  to  partition  and  disaggregate  30  MHz  licenses  after  the  auction.  61  No  other  commenter  supports  Nextel's  views,  and  several  parties 
 oppose  them.  62  As  stated,  we  recently  denied  Nextel's  request  in  the  C  Block  Reconsideration  Order,  and  the  record  in  this  proceeding  provides  us  with  no  basis  to  alter  our  decision. 


 17.  The  Commission  received  considerable  comment  on  whether  and  how  defaulters  on  payments  owed  the  Commission  should  be  able  to  participate  in  a  reauction.  Several  parties  would

 56  See  supra  para.  8. 


 57  An  entity  will  not  be  eligible  to  receive  bidding  credits  unless  it  meets  our  small  business  size  requirements 
 at  the  time  of  the  reauction.  See  discussion  infra  Section  V.  B.  10.

 preclude  defaulters  from  eligibility,  with  some  commenters  identifying  parties  that  have  defaulted  on  any  Commission  payment,  one  commenter  specifying  entities  that  have  defaulted  on  a  PCS  license  obligation, 
 and  another  commenter  targeting  parties  in  default  on  Commission  payments  at  the  time  their  reauction  upfront  payment  is  due.  63  CPCSI,  however,  would  allow  defaulters  to  participate  under  the  rationale  that 
 they  are  no  different  from  licensees  electing  an  alternative  payment  option.  64  CIRI  argues  that  a  reauction  should  be  restricted  to  parties  that  have  neither  defaulted  on  Commission  payment  obligations  nor  sought 
 bankruptcy  protection,  65  pointing  out  that  "[  t]  he  Debt  Collection  Improvement  Act  generally  prohibits  the  provision  of  any  federal  loan  to  an  entity  that  is  delinquent  on  any  non-  tax  debt  owed  to  a  federal 
 agency  66  .  .  .  ."  Commenters  oppose  allowing  (or  requiring)  defaulters  to  submit  more  detailed  financial  information  at  the  application  stage,  67  but  exhibit  little  reaction  to  the  idea  of  holding  an  expedited 
 hearing  or  requiring  defaulters  to  submit  a  higher  upfront  payment  amount.  68 
 18.  The  Commission's  FCC  Form  175  short-  form  application  for  all  auctions  requires  applicants  to  certify  that  they  are  not  in  default  on  any  Commission  debt  and  that  they  are  not  delinquent 
 on  any  non-  tax  debt  owed  to  any  Federal  agency.  69  We  believe  that,  in  order  to  preserve  the  integrity  of  C  block  reauctions  and  to  support  our  ongoing  effort  to  streamline  the  licensing  process,  it  is  necessary  to 
 limit  participation  in  C  block  reauctions  to  entities  that  can  make  the  certification.  Consequently,  to  be  eligible  to  participate  in  any  future  C  block  reauction,  an  applicant  must  certify  on  its  short-  form 
 application  that  it  is  not  in  default  on  any  Commission  licenses  and  not  delinquent  on  any  non-  tax  debt  owed  to  any  Federal  agency.  70  At  the  same  time,  we  believe  that  past  business  misfortunes  do  not

 inevitably  preclude  an  entity  from  being  able  to  meet  its  present  and  future  responsibilities  as  a  Commission  licensee.  Therefore,  we  will  allow  "former  defaulters,"  i.  e.,  applicants  that  have  defaulted  or 
 been  delinquent  in  the  past,  but  have  since  paid  all  of  their  outstanding  non-  Internal  Revenue  Service  Federal  debts  and  all  associated  charges  or  penalties,  to  be  eligible  to  participate  in  C  block  reauctions, 
 provided  that  they  are  otherwise  qualified. 
 19.  In  its  comments,  CIRI  asks  that  eligibility  for  a  reauction  include  the  Indian  tribal  affiliation  exemption  featured  in  the  Commission's  rules  for  broadband  PCS  auctions.  71  CIRI's  request  is 
 unnecessary.  Neither  the  Commission  nor  any  party  has  proposed  eliminating  or  altering  this  exemption,  which  applied  in  the  original  C  block  auction.  Moreover,  in  our  recent  Part  1  Third  Report  and  Order, 
 we  adopted  a  proposal  by  CIRI  to  include  this  exemption  in  our  general  definition  of  the  term  "affiliate."  72 
 V.  APPLICATION  OF  GENERAL  AUCTION  RULES  TO  C  BLOCK 
 A.  Background 
 20.  The  Commission  tentatively  concluded  in  the  C  Block  Further  Notice  that  the  next  reauction  will  be  conducted  in  conformity  with  the  general  competitive  bidding  rules  in  Part  1,  Subpart  Q, 
 of  the  Commission's  rules,  as  revised,  consistent  with  other  auctions  for  wireless  services.  The  Commission  also  proposed  to  use  Part  24  rules  to  the  extent  they  do  not  conflict  with  the  Commission's 
 Part  1  rules  or  with  rules  specifically  adopted  or  proposed  in  the  C  Block  Second  Report  and  Order  and  C  Block  Further  Notice.  The  Commission  sought  comment  on  the  application  of  Part  1  rules  to  the 
 following  aspects  of  the  C  block  reauction:  competitive  bidding  mechanisms;  73  bidding  application  and  certification  procedures  and  prohibition  of  collusion;  74  submission  of  upfront  payment,  down  payment 
 and  filing  of  long-  form  applications;  75  procedures  for  filing  long-  form  applications;  76  and  procedures  regarding  license  grant,  denial,  and  default.  77 


 percent  of  the  amount  of  the  past  due  payment.  If  any  licensee  fails  to  make  the  required  payment  at  the  close  of  the  90-  day  period,  it  will  automatically  be  provided  with  a  subsequent  90-  day  grace  period.  Any  licensee  making  a 
 required  payment  during  this  subsequent  period  will  be  assessed  a  late  payment  fee  equal  to  10  percent  of  the  amount  of  the  past  due  payment.  Id.  §1.2110(  f)(  4).

 21.  Subsequently,  in  the  Part  1  Third  Report  and  Order,  we  adopted  general  competitive  bidding  rules  that  apply  to  each  auctionable  service  or  class  of  service,  including  the  C  block  of 
 broadband  personal  communications  services.  78  In  that  order,  we  addressed,  and  in  some  cases  completely  or  partly  resolved,  the  issues  raised  in  the  C  Block  Further  Notice,  except  for  the  two  issues 
 discussed  above  in  this  C  Block  Fourth  Report  and  Order,  i.  e.,  licenses  to  be  reauctioned  and  eligibility  for  participation  in  C  block  reauctions.  We  also  clarified  that  specific  auction  procedures  not  established 
 by  Commission  rules  will  be  established  by  the  Bureau  in  advance  of  each  auction,  pursuant  to  public  notice  and  comment.  79  However,  the  Commission  received  sufficient  comment  in  response  to  the  C  Block 
 Further  Notice  to  make  further  comment  unnecessary  for  many  of  the  C  block  reauction  procedures.  Consequently,  in  the  remainder  of  this  C  Block  Fourth  Report  and  Order,  we  review  the  issues  raised  in 
 the  C  Block  Further  Notice  and  addressed  in  the  Part  1  Third  Report  and  Order.  Where  necessary,  we  clarify  the  effect  of  the  Part  1  Third  Report  and  Order  on  the  rules  for  future  C  block  reauctions.  In  cases 
 where  C  block  auction  rules  are  the  same  as  or  parallel  to  F  block  auction  rules,  we  also  clarify  the  effect  of  the  Part  1  Third  Report  and  Order  on  the  rules  for  F  block  reauctions.  We  have  included,  as  Appendix 
 B  herein,  a  discussion  of  the  comments  relevant  to  these  issues  filed  in  response  to  the  C  Block  Further  Notice. 


 B.  Discussion 
 1.  Competitive  Bidding  Design 
 22.  The  Commission  tentatively  concluded  in  the  C  Block  Further  Notice  that  it  would  award  all  licenses  and  spectrum  in  the  C  block  reauction  by  means  of  a  simultaneous  multiple-  round  electronic 
 auction.  80  This  type  of  auction  would  facilitate  any  aggregation  strategies  of  bidders  and  provide  the  most  information  about  license  values  during  the  auction.  The  Commission  further  tentatively  concluded  that 
 telephonic  bidding  (instead  of  electronic  bidding)  should  be  permitted  only  in  exceptional  circumstances,  and  that  those  circumstances  would  be  determined  by  the  Bureau  in  each  instance.  81  This  tentative 
 conclusion  was  prompted  by  the  Commission's  desire  to  conduct  the  reauction  quickly,  as  well  as  by  recent  improvements  in  the  Commission's  electronic  bidding  software.  82  In  the  Part  1  Third  Report  and 
 Order,  we  clarified  that  the  Bureau,  consistent  with  its  existing  delegated  authority,  83  would  seek

 (requiring  that,  in  the  scheduling  of  any  competitive  bidding,  an  adequate  period  be  allowed  before  issuance  of  bidding  rules,  to  permit  notice  and  comment  on  proposed  auction  procedures).

 comment  in  advance  of  each  auction  on  auction-  specific  issues,  including  the  competitive  bidding  design  of  the  auction.  84  We  note,  as  previously  mentioned,  that  there  likely  will  be  more  than  one  C  block 
 reauction.  85 
 23.  Even  though  the  Bureau  normally  would  determine  the  bidding  design  of  an  auction,  because  no  commenter  opposed  the  proposal  for  a  simultaneous  multiple-  round  auction,  86  we  believe  that 
 the  simultaneous  multiple-  round  design  is  appropriate  for  the  next  C  block  reauction.  If,  however,  in  preparing  for  a  C  block  reauction,  the  Bureau  determines  that  another  design  might  be  warranted,  it 
 remains  within  the  Bureau's  authority  to  seek  comment  on,  and  to  modify,  the  competitive  bidding  design  of  the  reauction.  The  Commission  received  two  comments  addressing  the  subject  of  telephonic  bidding, 
 with  one  party  supporting  the  proposal  that  telephonic  bidding  be  permitted  only  in  exceptional  circumstances  and  the  other  party  asking  that  telephonic  bidding  remain  an  option.  87  We  have  decided, 
 on  further  consideration,  to  permit  the  use  of  telephonic  bidding  as  an  alternative  to  electronic  bidding  in  the  next  C  block  reauction.  In  the  recent  local  multipoint  distribution  service  (LMDS)  auction  (Auction 
 No.  17),  88  telephonic  bidding  was  a  viable  option;  and  telephonic  bidding  is  being  made  available  to  bidders  in  the  upcoming  phase  II  220  MHz  service  auction  (Auction  No.  18).  89  We  believe  that  allowing 
 parties  to  use  either  electronic  or  telephonic  bidding,  as  their  circumstances  dictate,  will  promote  auction  participation  by  as  many  qualified  applicants  as  possible  and  is  not  inconsistent  with  our  decision  to 
 require  that,  beginning  January  1,  1999,  all  short  and  long-  form  applications  for  auctionable  services  be  filed  electronically.  90 


 2.  Activity  Rules 
 24.  In  the  C  Block  Further  Notice,  the  Commission  tentatively  concluded  that  a  reauction  should  be  conducted  in  three  stages,  as  the  Commission  has  done  in  other  simultaneous  multiple-  round

 auctions.  91  The  Commission  proposed  to  use  high  activity  requirements  in  C  block  reauctions,  with  bidders  required  to  be  more  active  in  each  subsequent  stage  than  they  had  been  in  the  last.  These  activity 
 levels  would  be  similar  to  those  used  in  other  auctions,  such  as  requiring  bidders  to  be  active  on  eighty  percent  of  their  eligible  licenses  in  Stage  I,  ninety  percent  in  Stage  II,  and  ninety-  eight  percent  in  Stage 
 III.  The  Commission  also  proposed  requiring  the  Bureau  to  use  its  delegated  authority  to  schedule  bidding  rounds  aggressively,  to  move  quickly  into  the  next  stage  of  the  auction  when  bidding  activity 
 falls,  and  to  use  higher  minimum  bid  increments  for  very  active  licenses.  In  the  Part  1  Third  Report  and  Order,  we  directed  the  Bureau  to  seek  comment  prior  to  the  start  of  each  auction  on  activity  requirements 
 for  each  stage  of  the  auction  and  activity  rule  waivers.  92 
 25.  We  believe  that  the  proposal  to  conduct  reauctions  in  three  stages  is  reasonable  for  the  next  C  block  reauction,  particularly  in  the  absence  of  opposing  comment  and  in  light  of  the  general 
 interest  in  beginning  the  reauction  as  soon  as  possible.  93  The  Bureau  normally  would  determine  this  structure,  however;  and  it  remains  within  the  Bureau's  discretion  to  deviate  from  the  proposed  three-  stage 
 structure  if,  after  appropriate  notice  and  comment,  it  determines  that  a  different  structure  would  better  serve  the  public  interest.  Given  that  the  C  Block  Further  Notice  mentioned  the  eighty,  ninety,  and  ninety-eight 
 percent  activity  levels  as  an  example,  94  we  continue  to  delegate  to  the  Bureau  determination  of  the  specific  activity  levels  to  employ  for  each  C  block  reauction.  As  proposed,  the  Bureau  will  use  its 
 delegated  authority  to  schedule  bidding  rounds  aggressively,  move  quickly  into  the  next  stage  of  the  auction  when  bidding  activity  falls,  and  use  higher  minimum  bid  increments  for  very  active  licenses. 


 3.  Reserve  Price,  Minimum  Opening  Bid,  and  Minimum  Bid  Increments 
 26.  The  Balanced  Budget  Act  of  1997  95  requires  the  Commission  to  prescribe  methods  by  which  a  reasonable  reserve  price  will  be  required  or  a  minimum  opening  bid  established,  unless  the 
 Commission  determines  that  neither  is  in  the  public  interest.  96  The  terms  "minimum  opening  bid"  and  "reserve  price"  are  generally  employed  for  different  purposes.  97  A  minimum  opening  bid  is  the  minimum

 bid  price  set  at  the  beginning  of  an  auction  below  which  no  bids  are  accepted.  98  A  reserve  price  is  the  minimum  price  below  which  an  auctioneer  will  not  sell  an  object.  99 
 27.  In  the  C  Block  Further  Notice,  the  Commission  stated  that,  in  the  C  block  reauction,  employing  a  minimum  opening  bid  would  help  make  certain  that  the  public  is  fairly  compensated,  the 
 auction  is  expedited,  and  the  Commission  is  able  to  make  adjustments  based  on  the  competitiveness  of  the  auction.  100  The  Commission  sought  comment  on  its  proposal  to  use  a  minimum  opening  bid  for  a 
 reauction,  as  well  as  on  which  methodology  to  employ  and  factors  to  consider  in  establishing  minimum  opening  bids.  101  The  Commission  proposed  minimum  opening  bids  for  each  market  equal  to  ten  percent 
 of  the  corresponding  net  high  bid  for  the  market  in  the  original  C  block  auction.  102  The  Commission  asked  commenters  to  explain  whether  this  proposal  would  be  reasonable  or  would  result  in  a  substantial 
 number  of  unsold  licenses.  103  The  Commission  asked  further  whether  the  amount  of  the  minimum  opening  bid  should  be  capped  and  whether  the  Commission  should  establish  a  different  amount.  104 


 28.  After  requesting  comment  on  minimum  opening  bids  in  the  C  Block  Further  Notice,  we  clarified  in  the  Part  1  Third  Report  and  Order  that  the  Bureau  has  the  authority  to  seek  comment  on 
 minimum  opening  bids  and  reserve  prices  and  to  establish  such  mechanisms  for  each  auction,  consistent  with  the  Bureau's  role  in  managing  the  auction  process  and  setting  valuations  for  other  purposes.  105  We 
 instructed  the  Bureau  to  consider  such  factors  as  the  amount  of  spectrum  being  auctioned,  levels  of  incumbency,  the  availability  of  technology  to  provide  service,  the  size  of  the  geographic  service  areas, 
 issues  of  interference  with  other  spectrum  bands,  and  any  other  relevant  factors  that  could  reasonably  affect  valuation  of  the  spectrum  being  auctioned.  106 


 29.  For  the  next  C  block  reauction,  we  believe  that  the  proposal  of  a  minimum  opening  bid  for  each  market  equal  to  ten  percent  of  the  corresponding  net  high  bid  for  the  market  in  the  original  C 
 block  auction  is  appropriate.  Because  the  Commission  has  already  sought  and  received  comment  on  this

 issue,  107  and  because  there  is  a  strong  public  interest  in  beginning  the  next  C  block  reauction  as  soon  as  possible,  the  Bureau  will  not  seek  further  comment  on  a  specific  amount  for  a  minimum  opening  bid  for 
 the  next  reauction.  Instead,  the  specific  amount  of  the  minimum  opening  bid  for  each  market  will  be  listed  in  a  public  notice  to  be  released  by  the  Bureau  in  advance  of  the  next  C  block  reauction.  The 
 Bureau  may  exercise  its  discretion  to  set  forth  a  minimum  opening  bid  smaller  than  ten  percent  if,  based  upon  further  evaluation,  the  Bureau  believes  that  a  smaller  amount  is  warranted. 


 4.  Electronic  Filing 
 30.  In  the  C  Block  Further  Notice,  the  Commission  sought  comment  on  its  tentative  conclusion  to  require  electronic  filing  of  all  short-  form  applications  in  a  reauction.  The  Commission 
 believed  that  electronic  filing  of  applications  would  serve  the  best  interests  of  auction  participants  and  members  of  the  public  monitoring  a  reauction.  108  Commission  policies  have  consistently  encouraged 
 electronic  filing.  In  the  Part  1  Third  Report  and  Order,  we  pointed  out  that  electronic  filing  helps  ensure  the  accuracy  and  completeness  of  applications  prior  to  submission,  and  we  required  electronic  filing  of  all 
 short-  form  and  long-  form  applications  by  January  1,  1999,  unless  operationally  infeasible.  109  More  recently,  we  proposed  mandatory  electronic  filing  of  applications  for  all  wireless  services,  whether 
 auctionable  or  non-  auctionable.  110  Accordingly,  we  will  require  electronic  filing  of  both  short-  form  and  long-  form  applications  for  C  block  reauctions. 


 5.  Upfront  Payment 
 31.  In  accordance  with  Section  1.2106  of  the  Commission's  rules,  which  requires  submission  of  an  upfront  payment  as  a  prerequisite  to  participation  in  spectrum  auctions,  111  the  Commission  proposed 
 in  the  C  Block  Further  Notice  to  set  an  upfront  payment  for  the  next  C  block  reauction  at  $.  06  per  MHz 
 107  Appendix  B,  infra,  summarizes  comments  received  by  the  Commission  on  reserve  price,  minimum  opening 
 bid,  and  minimum  bid  increments.

 per  pop.  112  The  Commission  determined  that  this  amount  was  appropriate  to  further  its  goal  of  allowing  only  serious,  qualified  applicants  to  participate  in  a  reauction.  113  The  Commission  noted  that  it  had 
 adopted  the  same  upfront  payment  for  its  most  recent  broadband  PCS  auction,  the  D,  E,  and  F  block  auction.  114  The  Commission  explained  that,  in  the  Competitive  Bidding  Second  Report  and  Order,  it  had 
 indicated  that  the  upfront  payment  should  be  set  using  a  formula  based  upon  the  amount  of  spectrum  and  population  ("  pops")  covered  by  the  license(  s)  for  which  the  parties  intend  to  bid.  115  It  had  also  concluded 
 that  the  best  approach  would  be  to  determine  the  amount  of  the  upfront  payment  on  an  auction-  by-  auction  basis.  116  In  the  C  Block  Further  Notice,  the  Commission  sought  comment  on  its  $.  06  per  MHz  per  pop 
 proposal,  as  well  as  on  alternative  methods  of  establishing  an  upfront  payment  and,  in  particular,  on  how  the  Commission  may  estimate  the  present  market  value  of  the  spectrum  to  be  auctioned.  117  Subsequently, 
 in  the  Part  1  Third  Report  and  Order,  we  affirmed  the  Commission's  reasoning  in  the  Competitive  Bidding  Second  Report  and  Order,  stating  our  belief  that  we  should  maintain  the  current  competitive 
 bidding  rules,  which  allow  the  amount  of  the  upfront  payment  and  the  terms  under  which  it  is  assessed  to  be  determined  on  an  auction-  by-  auction  basis.  118 


 32.  Deciding  the  amount  and  terms  of  the  upfront  payment  amount  on  an  auction-  by-  auction  basis  pursuant  to  the  Part  1  rule  is  consistent  with  past  auction  procedure.  The  Bureau  normally 
 establishes  the  upfront  payment  after  public  notice  and  comment.  We  therefore  find  that  specific  provisions  contained  in  Part  24  of  the  Commission's  rules  addressing  the  upfront  payment  amount  for  C 
 block  (and  F  block)  auctions  are  unnecessary.  119  Accordingly,  and  consistent  with  our  ongoing  streamlining  effort,  we  repeal  those  Part  24  provisions  as  of  the  effective  date  of  this  order. 


 33.  There  is  support  among  the  commenters  for  setting  the  upfront  payment  amount  at  the  proposed  $.  06  per  MHz  per  pop,  120  and  we  believe  that  in  the  next  C  block  reauction  the  upfront  payment

 113  The  amount  of  the  upfront  payment  is  intended  to  approximate  five  percent  of  the  expected  amount  of  the 
 winning  bid  for  a  given  license.  See  Amendment  of  Parts  21  and  74  of  the  Commission's  Rules  With  Regard  to  Filing  Procedures  in  the  Multipoint  Distribution  Service  and  in  the  Instructional  Television  Fixed  Service,  MM

 should  be  no  higher  than  this  amount.  The  Bureau  may  establish  a  lower  upfront  payment  if  it  deems  a  lower  amount  to  be  reasonable.  121  Because  the  Commission  has  already  sought  and  received  comment  on 
 this  issue,  and  because  there  is  a  strong  public  interest  in  beginning  the  next  C  block  reauction  as  soon  as  possible,  there  is  no  need  for  the  Bureau  to  seek  further  comment  on  the  upfront  payment  amount  for  the 
 next  reauction.  Instead,  the  specific  upfront  payment  amount  for  each  market  will  be  listed  in  a  public  notice  to  be  released  by  the  Bureau  in  advance  of  the  next  C  block  reauction. 


 34.  While  we  have  decided  not  to  prohibit  "former  defaulters"  from  participating  in  C  block  reauctions,  122  we  believe  that  the  integrity  of  the  auctions  program  and  the  licensing  process  dictates 
 requiring  a  more  stringent  financial  showing  from  applicants  with  a  poor  Federal  financial  track  record.  Consequently,  we  amend  our  rules  to  require  that  the  upfront  payment  amount  for  "former  defaulters"  be 
 fifty  percent  more  than  the  normal  amount  set  by  the  Bureau  for  any  given  license  in  a  C  block  reauction.  So  that  the  Bureau  may  implement  this  rule,  we  will  require  applicants  to  make  an  additional  certification 
 on  their  short-  form  applications  revealing  whether  they  have  ever  been  in  default  on  any  Commission  debt  or  have  ever  been  delinquent  on  any  non-  tax  debt  owed  to  any  Federal  agency.  Our  policy  here  is 
 analogous  to  the  Congressional  policy  reflected  in  the  Debt  Collection  Improvement  Act,  which  bars  delinquent  Federal  debtors  from  obtaining  Federal  loans,  loan  insurance,  or  guarantees.  123 


 6.  Down  Payment  and  Full  Payment 
 35.  The  Commission  tentatively  concluded  in  the  C  Block  Further  Notice  that  each  winning  bidder  should  be  required  to  tender  a  down  payment  sufficient  to  bring  its  total  amount  on  deposit  with 
 the  Commission  up  to  twenty  percent  of  its  winning  bid  within  ten  business  days  after  issuance  of  a  public  notice  announcing  the  winning  bidder  for  the  license.  124  The  Commission  also  proposed  to  require 
 a  winning  bidder  to  file  an  FCC  Form  600  long-  form  application  (since  renumbered  FCC  Form  601)  with  a  timely  down  payment,  125  pursuant  to  Section  1.2107  of  the  Commission's  rules.  126  Upon  review  of  the 
 long-  form  applications  and  receipt  of  the  down  payments,  the  Commission  would  announce  the  applications  that  were  accepted  for  filing,  triggering  the  filing  window  for  petitions  to  deny.  127  If  any  or 
 all  petitions  to  deny  were  dismissed  or  denied,  a  public  notice  announcing  that  the  Commission  was

 prepared  to  grant  the  license  conditioned  upon  final  and  full  payment  would  be  issued.  128  The  winning  bidder  would  then  have  ten  days  following  release  of  that  public  notice  to  submit  the  balance  of  its 
 winning  bid  in  order  to  be  awarded  its  license(  s).  The  C  Block  Further  Notice  proposed  having  a  period  of  fifteen  days,  following  the  issuance  of  the  public  notice  announcing  that  an  application  had  been 
 accepted  for  filing,  in  which  to  file  petitions  to  deny.  129 
 36.  The  Part  1  Third  Report  and  Order  adopted  a  standard  down  payment  of  twenty  percent  of  an  applicant's  high  bids,  which  is  similar  to  the  proposal  in  the  C  Block  Further  Notice.  130  It  also 
 amended  Sections  1.2109(  a)  of  the  Commission's  rules  131  to  permit  auction  winners  to  make  their  final  payments  within  ten  business  days  after  the  designated  deadline,  provided  that  they  also  pay  a  late  fee 
 equal  to  five  percent  of  the  amount  due.  132  In  accordance  with  the  1997  Balanced  Budget  Act,  133  the  Part  1  Third  Report  and  Order  amended  Sections  1.2108(  b)  and  (c)  to  prohibit  the  Commission  from  granting 
 a  license  earlier  than  seven  days  following  issuance  of  the  public  notice  announcing  the  application  is  accepted  for  filing.  134  Additionally,  the  Part  1  Third  Report  and  Order  established  that  the  filing  periods 
 for  petitions  to  deny,  oppositions,  and  replies  are  to  be  no  shorter  than  five  days.  135

 provision  states: 


 Notwithstanding  section  309(  b)  of  the  Communications  Act  of  1934  (47  U.  S.  C.  309(  b)),  no  application  for  an  instrument  of  authorization  for  frequencies  assigned  under  this  title.  .  .  shall  be  granted  by 
 the  Commission  earlier  than  7  days  following  issuance  of  a  public  notice  by  the  Commission  of  the  acceptance  for  filing  of  such  application  or  of  any  substantial  amendment  thereto. 
 Notwithstanding  section  309(  d)(  1)  of  such  Act  (47  U.  S.  C.  309(  d)(  1)),  the  Commission  may  specify  a  period  (no  less  than  5  days  following  issuance  of  such  public  notice)  for  the  filing  of 
 petitions  to  deny  any  application  for  an  instrument  of  authorization  for  such  frequencies.

 37.  The  conclusions  we  reached  in  the  Part  1  Third  Report  and  Order  do  not  conflict  with  our  proposals  in  the  C  Block  Further  Notice.  Accordingly,  we  will  apply  the  Part  1  rules,  as  amended. 
 The  Bureau  will  announce  by  public  notice  the  deadline  for  petitions  to  deny.  As  discussed  in  the  Part  1  Third  Report  and  Order,  in  order  to  preserve  the  integrity  of  the  auction  process,  it  is  important  to  use  an 
 indicator  of  potential  licensees'  financial  capability  to  attract  capital  to  build  out  and  operate  systems.  We  believe  that  the  use  of  one  substantial  down  payment  is  a  necessary  tool  to  gauge  an  applicant's  financial 
 viability,  its  seriousness  in  building  its  system,  and  the  likelihood  of  default.  136  For  these  reasons,  we  repeal  the  Part  24  C  block  rules  on  down  payment  and  full  payment.  137  Pursuant  to  the  same  rationale,  we 
 also  repeal  the  Part  24  F  block  rules  on  down  payment  and  full  payment.  138 
 7.  Amendments  and  Modifications  of  Applications 
 38.  In  the  C  Block  Further  Notice,  the  Commission  proposed  to  allow  applicants  to  amend  or  modify  their  short-  form  applications  at  any  time  before  or  during  the  auction,  pursuant  to  Section  1.2105 
 of  the  Commission's  rules.  139  In  the  Part  1  Third  Report  and  Order,  we  created  a  uniform  definition  of  minor  and  major  amendments  to  an  applicant's  short-  form  application  (FCC  Form  175).  140  We  also 
 amended  Section  1.2105  of  the  Commission's  rules  so  that  it  would  mirror  our  Part  24  rule,  Section  24.822,  and  allow  applicants,  after  the  short-  form  filing  deadline,  to  make  minor  amendments  to  their 
 short-  form  applications  both  prior  to  and  during  the  auction.  The  amendment  to  Section  1.2105  of  the  Commission's  rules  has  rendered  Section  24.822  unnecessary.  Accordingly,  we  repeal  Section  24.822  of 
 the  rules. 
 39.  The  Commission  also  proposed  in  the  C  Block  Further  Notice  to  create  an  exception  to  the  general  rule  prohibiting  major  amendments  and  permit  short-  form  amendments  to  reflect  the  departure 
 of  a  consortium  member.  141  In  the  Part  1  Third  Report  and  Order,  we  determined  that,  under  Part  1  of  the  Commission's  rules,  major  amendments  to  the  short-  form  include  changes  in  license  areas,  ownership 
 changes  constituting  a  change  in  control,  and  the  addition  of  members  to  a  bidding  consortium.  142  Minor  amendments  include,  inter  alia,  any  amendment  not  identified  as  major.  143  We  did  not  identify  the

 deletion  of  members  to  a  bidding  consortium  as  a  major  amendment.  Consequently,  it  would  be  a  minor  amendment  under  the  Part  1  rules,  as  amended,  and  permitted  after  the  short-  form  filing  deadline. 
 Accordingly,  the  Commission's  proposal  in  the  C  Block  Further  Notice  to  allow  short-  form  amendments  reflecting  the  departure  of  a  consortium  member  is  no  longer  necessary.

 8.  Bid  Withdrawal,  Default,  and  Disqualification 
 40.  The  Commission  tentatively  concluded  in  the  C  Block  Further  Notice  that  the  withdrawal,  default,  and  disqualification  rules  for  a  reauction  should  be  based  upon  the  procedures 
 established  in  our  general  competitive  bidding  rules.  144  In  the  Part  1  Third  Report  and  Order,  we  recognized  that  bidders  sometimes  improperly  withdraw  bids  (e.  g.,  to  delay  the  close  of  an  auction  for 
 strategic  purposes),  and  we  suggested  that  the  Bureau  exercise  its  discretion  to  prevent  such  abuses  of  the  auction  process.  145  We  asked  the  Bureau  to  consider  limiting  the  number  of  rounds  in  which  bids  may  be 
 withdrawn,  thereby  preventing  any  entities  that  violate  the  Commission's  withdrawal  procedures  from  continuing  to  bid  on  that  particular  market.  146  The  Bureau  has  announced  that,  in  the  upcoming  phase  II 
 220  MHz  service  auction  (Auction  No.  18),  it  will  limit  the  number  of  rounds  in  which  bids  may  be  withdrawn,  147  and  it  has  proposed  such  a  limitation  for  the  upcoming  156-  162  MHz  VHF  public  coast 
 station  spectrum  auction.  148  Similarly,  the  Bureau  will  seek  comment  in  advance  of  the  next  C  block  reauction  on  limiting  the  number  of  rounds  in  that  reauction  in  which  bids  may  be  withdrawn. 


 41.  For  bids  submitted  in  error,  the  Commission  proposed  in  the  C  Block  Further  Notice  to  follow  the  guidelines  it  had  developed  to  provide  relief  from  the  bid  withdrawal  payment  requirements 
 under  certain  circumstances.  149  In  the  Part  1  Third  Report  and  Order,  we  decided  that  when  a  winning  bidder  or  licensee  defaults,  and  its  license  has  yet  to  be  reauctioned,  the  Commission  will  assess  an  initial 
 default  payment  of  at  least  three  percent,  but  not  exceeding  twenty  percent,  of  the  defaulted  bid  amount.  150  Once  the  license  has  been  reauctioned,  when  the  total  default  payment  can  be  determined,  the 
 Commission  will  either  assess  the  balance  of  the  remaining  default  payment  or  refund  any  amounts  due.  151  As  a  result  of  "click  box  bidding"  and  other  mechanisms  employed  to  reduce  erroneous  bids,  we 
 concluded  that  a  decreased  bid  withdrawal  payment  rule,  meant  to  provide  some  bidders  relief  from  full

 application  of  bid  withdrawal  payments,  is  not  necessary.  152  We  direct  the  Bureau  to  follow  the  Part  1  rule  on  bid  withdrawal,  default,  and  disqualification,  Section  1.2104(  g),  to  the  extent  applicable.  153 
 9.  Anti-  Collusion  Rules 
 42.  The  Commission  proposed  in  the  C  Block  Further  Notice  to  apply  the  anti-  collusion  rules  enumerated  in  the  Competitive  Bidding  Second  Report  and  Order.  154  In  the  Part  1  Third  Report  and 
 Order,  we  created  an  exception  to  the  Commission's  general  anti-  collusion  rules.  155  Under  this  exception,  a  non-  controlling  attributable  interest  holder  in  an  applicant  may  obtain  an  ownership  interest  in,  or  enter 
 into  a  consortium  arrangement  with,  another  applicant  for  a  license  in  the  same  geographic  area,  provided  that  the  original  applicant  has  withdrawn  from  the  auction,  is  no  longer  placing  bids,  and  has  no  further 
 eligibility.  156  The  exception  provides  flexibility  for  non-  controlling  investors  to  invest  in  other  auction  applicants  if  their  original  applicant  fails  to  complete  the  auction.  157 


 43.  Although  one  commenter  to  the  C  Block  Further  Notice  raised  the  issue  of  creating  a  "safe  harbor"  for  discussions  of  non-  auction  related  business  matters  between  applicants  in  the  same 
 license  area,  158  we  determined  in  the  Part  1  Third  Report  and  Order  that  there  was  no  need  to  create  a  "safe  harbor."  159  Section  1.2105(  c)  of  the  Commission's  rules  places  significant  limitations  on  applicants 
 seeking  business  opportunities  in  geographic  license  areas  where  they  plan  to  bid.  We  concluded  that  interpretations  of  the  anti-  collusion  rules  provided  by  the  Bureau  instruct  the  public  as  to  permissible  non-auction 
 discussions,  obviating  the  need  for  a  "safe  harbor"  in  the  auction  process.  160

 44.  As  we  noted  in  the  Third  Report  and  Order,  however,  auction  applicants  should  be  aware  that  communications  concerning,  but  not  limited  to,  issues  such  as  management,  resale,  roaming, 
 interconnection,  partitioning  and  disaggregation  may  all  raise  impermissible  subject  matter  for  discussion  because  they  may  convey  pricing  information  and  bidding  strategy.  Because  auction  applicants  should 
 avoid  all  communication  with  each  other  that  will  likely  affect  bids  or  bidding  strategies,  we  believe  that  individual  applicants,  and  not  the  Commission,  are  in  the  best  position  to  determine  in  the  first  instance 
 which  communications  are  permissible  and  which  are  not.  161  Bidders  should  familiarize  themselves  with  Commission  rules  and  rule  interpretations  regarding  unauthorized  communications  in  auction 
 proceedings,  and  they  should  report  any  such  communications  to  the  Bureau.  162  As  always,  the  Commission  retains  the  right  to  investigate  possible  instances  of  collusion  or  to  refer  any  allegations  of 
 collusion  to  the  United  States  Department  of  Justice  for  investigation.  163 
 10.  Bidding  Credits 
 45.  The  original  C  block  auction  offered  winning  bidders  qualifying  as  a  small  business  or  a  consortium  of  small  businesses  a  bidding  credit  of  twenty-  five  percent  of  winning  bids.  The 
 Commission's  rules  defined  a  small  business  as  "an  entity  that,  together  with  its  affiliates  and  persons  or  entities  that  hold  interest  in  such  entity  and  their  affiliates,  has  average  annual  gross  revenues  that  are  not 
 more  than  forty  million  dollars  for  the  preceding  three  years."  164  Subsequent  to  that  auction,  we  amended  our  rules  to  define  also  a  very  small  business  in  the  C  or  F  blocks  as  "an  entity  that,  together  with  its 
 affiliates  and  persons  or  entities  that  hold  interest  in  such  entity  and  their  affiliates,  has  average  annual  gross  revenues  that  are  not  more  than  fifteen  million  dollars  for  the  preceding  three  years."  165  The

 Commission  proposed  in  the  C  Block  Further  Notice  to  have  two  tiers  of  bidding  credits  for  the  next  C  block  reauction,  a  twenty-  five  percent  bidding  credit  for  small  businesses  and  a  thirty-  five  percent  bidding 
 credit  for  very  small  businesses.  166 
 46.  In  order  to  provide  continuity  and  certainty  for  auction  participants,  we  adopted  a  schedule  of  bidding  credits  in  the  Part  1  Third  Report  and  Order  to  be  used  in  future  auctions  for  all 
 services.  167  The  schedule  sets  the  bidding  credit  percentage  according  to  the  average  annual  gross  revenues  of  the  designated  entity.  168  Applying  the  Part  1  schedule  to  the  gross  revenue  thresholds  for 
 small  and  very  small  businesses  under  our  rules  for  C  and  F  block  auctions,  we  conclude  that  a  small  business  will  receive  a  fifteen  percent  bidding  credit,  169  and  a 
 very  small  business  will  receive  a  bidding  credit  of  twenty-  five  percent.  170  We  recognize  that  the  amount  of  bidding  credits  differs  from  the  Commission's  proposal  in  the  C  Block  Further  Notice;  however,  use  of 
 the  Part  1  schedule  benefits  potential  bidders  by  providing  them  with  certainty  about  the  size  of  available  bidding  credits  well  in  advance  of  C  block  reauctions.  We  will  amend  Sections  24.712  and  24.717  of  the 
 Commission's  rules  171  to  reflect  our  application  of  the  Part  1  bidding  credits  schedule  to  C  and  F  block  reauctions. 


 47.  Eligibility  for  bidding  credits  will  be  determined  at  the  deadline  for  filing  short-  form  applications.  Thus,  if  an  entity  no  longer  qualifies  as  a  small  business  as  of  the  deadline  for  filing  short-form 
 applications,  but  is  eligible  to  participate  in  the  next  C  block  reauction  because  it  was  eligible  to  participate  in  the  original  C  block  auction,  172  it  will  not  be  eligible  for  bidding  credits.  Because  of  the 
 complex  issues  involved  in  the  original  C  block  auction,  173  we  are  willing  to  allow  former  C  block  auction  participants  and  eligible  applicants  to  participate  in  the  next  reauction  (and  in  reauctions  for  the  ensuing 
 two  years).  However,  we  do  not  feel  that  it  is  in  the  best  interests  of  the  public  and,  in  particular,  of  competing  small  business  bidders  and  licensees  to  provide  a  discount  to  applicants  that  no  longer  meet  the 
 small  business  size  standards.

 48.  We  remind  applicants  that,  under  Section  1.2111(  d)  of  our  rules,  as  amended,  C  block  licensees  that  utilize  a  bidding  credit,  and  during  their  initial  license  term  seek  to  make  a  change  in  the 
 ownership  or  control  of  a  license  that  would  result  in  the  license's  being  owned  or  controlled  by  an  entity  that  does  not  meet  the  eligibility  criteria  for  a  bidding  credit,  or  that  is  eligible  for  a  lower  bidding  credit, 
 will  have  to  reimburse  the  U.  S.  Government  for  a  percentage  of  the  amount  of  the  bidding  credit.  174  This  percentage,  in  some  circumstances,  will  be  as  high  as  the  full  amount  of  the  bidding  credit  plus  interest.  175 


 11.  Installment  Payment  Program 
 49.  The  Commission  tentatively  concluded  in  the  C  Block  Further  Notice  that  it  would  not  provide  an  installment  payment  program  in  the  next  reauction.  176  Subsequently,  in  the  Part  1  Third 
 Report  and  Order  we  suspended  the  installment  payment  program  for  the  immediate  future.  177 
 50.  We  will  apply  our  decision  in  the  Part  1  Third  Report  and  Order  and  not  offer  installment  payments  in  the  next  reauction.  It  is  our  responsibility  to  balance  the  competing  goals  in 
 Section  309(  j)  that  require,  inter  alia,  that  the  Commission  promote  the  development  and  rapid  deployment  of  new  spectrum-  based  services,  while  ensuring  that  designated  entities  are  given  an 
 opportunity  to  participate  in  the  provision  of  such  services.  178  We  recognize  that  conditioning  receipt  of  a  license  upon  payment  requires  greater  financial  resources.  179  However,  many  C  block  licensees  have 
 requested  relief  from  their  installment  payment  obligations  and  three  have  sought  bankruptcy  protection.  180  The  objective  of  Section  309(  j)  to  speed  service  to  the  public  cannot  be  achieved  when 
 licenses  are  held  in  abeyance  in  bankruptcy  court.  Other  financing  alternatives,  such  as  the  provision  of  bidding  credits,  181  will  help  to  ensure  meaningful  small  business  participation.  182

 Appendix  B 
 Comments  on  Issues  Addressed  in  Part  1  Third  Report  and  Order 


 Competitive  Bidding  Design 
 Omnipoint  supports  the  Commission's  proposal  to  have  a  single  simultaneous,  multiple-  round  reauction.  183  Duluth  also  supports  the  proposal,  provided  that  telephonic  bidding  remains  as  an  option; 
 whereas,  NextWave  asks  for  a  requirement  that  all  bids  be  submitted  electronically  with  emergency  telephone  backup.  184 


 Bidding  Procedures 
 Duluth  suggests  the  initial  C  block  competitive  bidding  rules  contained  in  Part  24  would  be  appropriate  for  a  reauction  since  both  the  initial  auction  and  the  next  reauction  involve  the  provision  of 
 only  one  frequency  block.  185 
 Activity  Rules 
 Parties  commenting  on  activity  rules  for  a  reauction  generally  support  the  Commission's  tentative  conclusion  and  its  proposal.  186 


 Reserve  Price,  Minimum  Opening  Bid,  and  Minimum  Bid  Increments 
 Conestoga  asks  that  the  Commission  set  neither  a  minimum  opening  bid  nor  a  reserve  price  for  any  C  block  license  or  spectrum.  187  Duluth  opposes  any  minimum  opening  bid  or  reserve  price  that 
 differs  from  that  used  in  the  original  C  block  auction.  188  Several  parties  disagree  with  setting  the  minimum  opening  bids  for  each  market  at  10  percent  of  the  corresponding  high  bid  for  the  market  in  the

 187  Conestoga  Comments  at  2,  3-  4. 


 188  Duluth  Comments  at  2.  We  note  that  no  minimum  opening  bids  or  reserve  prices  were  employed  for  the 
 original  C  block  auction.

 original  C  block  auction.  189  AT&  T  asks  that  the  Commission  set  a  reserve  price  of  not  less  than  fifty  percent  of  the  corresponding  high  bid  in  the  original  C  block  auction.  190 
 Electronic  Filing 
 Only  one  commenter  addressed  this  proposal,  supporting  mandatory  electronic  filing  for  short-form  applications.  191 


 Upfront  Payment 
 Several  parties  filed  comments  addressing  this  issue.  While  some  commenters  believe  that  $.  06  per  MHz  per  pop  is  excessive,  192  others  agree  that  this  upfront  payment  amount  is  appropriate.  193 


 Down  Payment  and  Full  Payment 
 Two  commenters  oppose  requiring  full  cash  payment  upon  winning  a  license.  194 
 Bid  Withdrawal,  Default,  and  Disqualification 
 NextWave  proposes  to  prohibit  a  bidder  from  rebidding  on  the  same  market  from  which  it  withdraws  a  bid,  once  overall  auction  activity  falls  below  a  certain  level.  195  ClearComm  suggests  that  no 
 withdrawal  payment  be  imposed  when  an  unintended  bidding  error  is  made.  196

 Anti-  Collusion  Rules 
 NextWave  proposes  the  creation  of  a  "safe  harbor."  197  Two  commenters  propose  that  the  Commission  clarify  specific  aspects  of  the  anti-  collusion  rules.  198 


 Bidding  Credits 
 CIRI  supports  the  Commission's  proposal  in  the  C  Block  Further  Notice  to  adopt  a  "very  small  business"  definition,  but  urges  the  adoption  of  "heightened"  bidding  credits  of  45  percent  for  very  small 
 businesses  and  35  percent  for  small  businesses.  199  CIRI  also  suggests  limiting  eligibility  for  bidding  credits  to  participants  that  are  not  delinquent  on  installment  payments  at  the  time  short-  form  applications 
 are  filed  for  a  reauction.  200  AirGate  suggests  that  eligibility  for  bidding  credits  be  determined  at  the  time  the  short-  form  is  filed  for  a  reauction,  so  that  an  entity  that  was  initially  eligible  for  bidding  credits,  but 
 has  grown  beyond  that  classification,  would  not  continue  to  receive  that  benefit.  201  Omnipoint  disagrees,  arguing  that  if  an  entity  received  bidding  credits  in  the  initial  auction,  it  should  be  awarded  bidding 
 credits  in  a  reauction,  even  though  it  no  longer  meets  our  criteria  for  bidding  credits.  202  Otherwise,  according  to  Omnipoint,  the  Commission  will  be  punishing  such  entities  for  their  "financial  progress."  203 
 Omnipoint  further  argues  that  the  Commission's  Competitive  Bidding  Fifth  Memorandum  Opinion  and  Order  states  a  licensee's  increased  gross  revenues  or  total  assets  or  that  of  its  attributable  entities  should 
 not  be  counted  against  that  licensee's  continuing  eligibility  as  an  entrepreneur.  204

 APPENDIX  D 
 Final  Regulatory  Flexibility  Analysis 
 As  required  by  the  Regulatory  Flexibility  Act  (RFA),  206  an  Initial  Regulatory  Flexibility  Analysis  (IRFA)  was  incorporated  into  the  C  Block  Further  Notice  of  Proposed  Rule  Making  in  WT  Docket  No. 
 97-  82  ("  C  Block  Further  Notice").  207  The  Commission  sought  written  public  comment  on  the  proposals  in  the  C  Block  Further  Notice,  including  comment  on  the  IRFA.  This  present  Final  Regulatory  Flexibility 
 Analysis  (FRFA)  conforms  to  the  RFA.  208 
 A.  Need  for,  and  objectives  of,  the  C  Block  Fourth  Report  and  Order  in  WT  Docket  No.  97-  82 
 This  C  Block  Fourth  Report  and  Order  sets  forth  the  rules  that  will  govern  reauctions  of  C  block  spectrum  surrendered  to  the  Commission  pursuant  to  the  C  Block  Second  Report  and  Order  209  and  the  C 
 Block  Order  on  Reconsideration  of  the  Second  Report  and  Order  ("  C  Block  Reconsideration  Order"),  210  as  well  as  any  other  C  block  spectrum  available  for  reauction.  The  C  Block  Fourth  Report  and  Order  also 
 reflects  the  Commission's  ongoing  effort  to  streamline  auction  procedures  by  eliminating  overlapping  or  redundant  rules  and  simplifying  procedures  for  auction  participants. 


 B.  Summary  of  significant  issues  raised  by  public  comments  in  response  to  the  IRFA 
 There  were  no  comments  filed  directly  in  response  to  the  IRFA.  The  Commission,  however,  has  considered  the  economic  impact  on  small  businesses  of  the  rules  adopted  herein.  See  section  E,  infra. 


 206  See  5  U.  S.  C.  §  603.  The  RFA,  see  5  U.  S.  C.  §  601  et  seq.,  has  been  amended  by  the  Contract  With  America 
 Advancement  Act  of  1996,  Pub.  L.  No.  104-  121,  110  Stat.  847  (1996)  ("  CWAAA").  Title  II  of  the  CWAAA  is  the  Small  Business  Regulatory  Enforcement  Fairness  Act  of  1996  ("  SBREFA").

 C.  Description  and  estimate  of  the  number  of  small  entities  to  which  the  rules  will  apply 
 The  RFA  directs  agencies  to  provide  a  description  of  and,  where  feasible,  an  estimate  of  the  number  of  small  entities  that  will  be  affected  by  our  rules.  211  The  RFA  generally  defines  the  term  "small 
 entity"  as  having  the  same  meaning  as  the  terms  "small  business,"  "small  organization,"  and  "small  governmental  jurisdiction."  212  In  addition,  the  term  "small  business"  has  the  same  meaning  as  the  term 
 "small  business  concern"  under  the  Small  Business  Act.  213  Under  the  Small  Business  Act,  a  "small  business  concern"  is  one  which:  (1)  is  independently  owned  and  operated;  (2)  is  not  dominant  in  its  field 
 of  operation;  and  (3)  meets  any  additional  criteria  established  by  the  Small  Business  Administration  ("  SBA").  214 


 The  rule  changes  effected  by  this  C  Block  Fourth  Report  and  Order  affect  all  small  businesses  that  participate  in  future  reauctions  of  C  block  and  F  block  spectrum,  including  small  businesses  currently 
 holding  C  block  and  F  block  broadband  personal  communications  services  (PCS)  licenses  that  choose  to  participate  and  other  small  businesses  that  may  acquire  licenses  through  reauction.  The  Commission 
 grants  C  block  and  F  block  licenses  only  to  applicants  that,  together  with  their  affiliates  and  persons  or  entities  that  hold  interests  in  the  applicants  and  their  affiliates,  have  gross  revenues  of  less  than  $125 
 million  in  each  of  the  last  two  years  and  total  assets  of  less  than  $500  million.  215  The  Commission,  with  respect  to  broadband  PCS,  defines  small  businesses  as  entities  that,  together  with  their  affiliates  and 
 persons  or  entities  that  hold  interest  in  such  entities  and  their  affiliates,  have  average  annual  gross  revenues  that  are  not  more  than  forty  million  dollars  for  the  preceding  three  years.  216  This  definition  has 
 been  approved  by  the  SBA.  217 
 On  May  6,  1996,  the  Commission  concluded  the  broadband  PCS  C  block  auction.  The  broadband  PCS  D,  E,  and  F  block  auction  closed  on  January  14,  1997.  Ninety  bidders  (including  the  C  block 
 reauction  winners,  prior  to  any  defaults  by  winning  bidders)  won  493  C  block  licenses  and  88  bidders  won  491  F  block  licenses.  Small  businesses  placing  high  bids  in  the  C  and  F  block  auctions  were  eligible 
 for  bidding  credits  and  installment  payment  plans.  For  purposes  of  our  evaluations  and  conclusions  in

 this  RFA,  we  assume  that  all  of  the  90  C  block  broadband  PCS  licensees  and  88  F  block  broadband  PCS  licensees,  a  total  of  178  licensees  potentially  affected  by  this  C  Block  Fourth  Report  and  Order,  are  small 
 entities.  In  addition  to  the  178  current  small  business  licensees  that  may  participate  at  the  reauction  of  C  block  licenses,  a  number  of  additional  small  business  entities  may  seek  to  acquire  licenses  through 
 reauction  and  would  thus  be  affected  by  these  rules. 
 In  addition,  the  Commission  will  provide  small  business  bidders  and  very  small  business  bidders  in  C  block  and  F  block  reauctions  with  bidding  credits,  with  a  greater  discount  given  to  very  small 
 businesses.  218  Under  Commission  rules,  very  small  businesses  in  the  C  block  and  F  block  are  entities  that,  together  with  their  affiliates  and  persons  or  entities  that  hold  interest  in  such  entities  and  their 
 affiliates,  have  average  annual  gross  revenues  of  not  more  that  fifteen  million  for  the  preceding  three  years.  219  As  discussed  below,  small  businesses  will  receive  a  fifteen  percent  bidding  credit,  and  very 
 small  businesses  will  receive  a  bidding  credit  of  twenty-  five  percent. 
 D.  Description  of  reporting,  recordkeeping,  and  other  compliance  requirements 
 As  a  result  of  the  C  Block  Fourth  Report  and  Order,  each  applicant  for  a  C  block  reauction  will  be  required  to  attach  to  its  short-  form  application  a  statement  indicating  whether  or  not  the  applicant  has 
 ever  been  in  default  on  any  Commission  licenses  or  has  ever  been  delinquent  on  any  non-  tax  debt  owed  to  any  Federal  agency.  220 


 E.  Steps  taken  to  minimize  significant  economic  impact  on  small  entities,  and  significant  alternatives  considered 
 The  Commission  will  include  in  the  next  C  block  reauction  all  licenses  representing  C  block  spectrum  returned  to  the  Commission  under  the  disaggregation,  prepayment,  or  amnesty  options 
 established  in  the  C  Block  Second  Report  and  Order,  as  modified  in  the  C  Block  Reconsideration  Order,  as  well  as  all  C  block  licenses  held  by  the  Commission  as  a  result  of  defaults.  While  some  commenters 
 argue  that  the  next  reauction  should  include  licenses  that  have  filed  for  bankruptcy  protection,  221  the  Commission  believes  that  the  public  and  C  block  reauction  applicants  will  realize  a  greater  benefit  if  the 
 Commission  auctions  all  available  C  block  spectrum  as  soon  as  practicable  than  they  will  if  the 


 218  In  the  C  block  auction,  a  winning  bidder  that  qualified  as  a  small  business  or  a  consortium  of  small 
 businesses  was  able  to  use  a  bidding  credit  equal  to  25  percent  of  its  winning  bid.  For  the  reauction,  the  Commission  proposes  tiered  bidding  credits,  as  were  offered  for  F  block  and,  more  recently,  Local  Multipoint 


 Distribution  Service  (LMDS)  small  business  bidders.

 220  See  C  Block  Fourth  Report  and  Order,  supra,  at  para.  34. 
 221  Certain  C  block  licensees  have  filed  for  bankruptcy  protection.  See  In  re  GWI  PCS1,  Inc.,  No.  397-  39676- 
 SAF-  11  (Bankr.  N.  D.  Tex.  April  24,  1998);  In  re  Pocket  Communications,  Inc.,  No.  97-  5-  4105(  ESD)  (Bankr.  D.  Md.);  In  re  NextWave  Personal  Communications,  Inc.,  98  21529  (ASH)  (Bankr.  S.  D.  N.  Y.).

 Commission  postpones  a  reauction  until  it  has  resolved  all  issues  connected  with  ongoing  bankruptcy  proceedings. 
 The  following  two  types  of  entities  will  be  eligible  to  participate  in  C  block  reauctions:  (1)  entities  that  filed  an  FCC  Form  175  short-  form  application  for,  and  were  eligible  for,  the  original  C  block 
 auction,  and  (2)  entities  qualifying  under  Section  24.709  of  the  Commission's  rules  222  as  of  the  deadline  for  the  filing  of  short-  form  applications  for  the  reauction.  All  but  two  of  the  entities  that  applied  for  and 
 were  eligible  to  participate  in  the  original  C  block  auction  qualified  as  small  businesses  under  Section  24.720  of  the  Commissions  rules.  223  In  order  to  ensure  the  integrity  of  C  block  reauctions,  the 
 Commission  retains  the  eligibility  restriction  established  in  the  C  Block  Second  Report  and  Order,  as  modified  in  the  C  Block  Reconsideration  Order,  for  licensees  that  surrender  licenses  pursuant  to  the 
 disaggregation,  prepayment,  and/  or  "amnesty/  prepayment"  options.  Such  licensees  will  be  ineligible  to  reacquire  their  surrendered  licenses  through  reauction  or  by  any  other  means  for  a  period  of  two  years 
 from  the  start  date  of  the  next  C  block  reauction.  224 
 To  further  ensure  auction  integrity  for  the  benefit  of  applicants  as  well  as  the  general  public,  the  Commission  will  restrict  C  block  reauctions  to  entities  not  in  default  on  any  Commission  debt  and  not 
 delinquent  on  any  non-  tax  debt  owed  to  any  Federal  agency.  However,  the  Commission  believes  that  past  business  misfortunes  do  not  inevitably  preclude  an  entity  from  being  able  to  meet  its  present  and  future 
 responsibilities  as  a  Commission  licensee.  Therefore,  the  Commission  will  allow  "former  defaulters,"  i.  e.,  applicants  that  have  defaulted  or  been  delinquent  in  the  past,  but  have  since  paid  all  of  their  outstanding 
 non-  Internal  Revenue  Service  Federal  debts  and  all  associated  charges  or  penalties,  to  be  eligible  to  participate  in  C  block  reauctions,  provided  that  they  are  otherwise  qualified. 


 In  the  Part  1  Third  Report  and  Order,  225  the  Commission  adopted  general  competitive  bidding  rules  to  supplant,  wherever  practicable,  specific  auction  rules  for  each  auctionable  service  or  class  of 
 service.  Accordingly,  future  C  block  reauctions  will  adhere  to  Part  1  rules,  insofar  as  applicable.  Part  1  rules  are  determinative  for  the  following  aspects  of  C  block  reauctions:  competitive  bidding  design; 
 activity  rules;  reserve  price,  minimum  opening  bid,  and  minimum  bid  increments;  electronic  filing;  upfront  payment;  down  payment  and  full  payment;  amendments  and  modifications  of  applications;  bid 
 withdrawal,  default,  and  disqualification;  anti-  collusion,  and  installment  payment  financing.  Based  upon  the  record  in  this  proceeding,  the  Commission  sets  a  ceiling  for  minimum  opening  bids  that  is  no  more

 than  ten  percent  of  the  amount  of  the  net  high  bid  for  the  corresponding  market  in  the  original  C  block  auction.  The  Commission  also  sets  the  upfront  payment  amount  for  the  next  C  block  reauction  at  no 
 higher  than  $.  06  per  MHz  per  pop.  The  Commission  will  require  that  the  upfront  payment  for  "former  defaulters"  be  50  percent  more  than  that  required  from  applicants  that  do  not  have  a  history  of  default. 
 This  increased  upfront  payment  formula  reflects  the  increased  risk  associated  with  these  parties. 
 In  the  Part  1  Third  Report  and  Order,  the  Commission  adopted  a  schedule  of  bidding  credits  to  be  used  in  future  auctions  for  all  services.  Applying  the  Part  1  schedule  to  the  gross  revenue  thresholds 
 under  the  Part  24  rules  for  small  and  very  small  C  block  and  F  block  businesses,  gives  small  business  applicants  in  C  block  reauctions  a  fifteen  percent  bidding  credit  and  very  small  business  applicants  a 
 twenty-  five  percent  bidding  credit.  Eligibility  for  bidding  credits  will  be  determined  by  the  size  of  the  applicant  as  of  the  deadline  for  filing  short-  form  applications. 


 Section  309(  j)  of  the  Communications  Act  of  1934,  as  amended,  directs  the  Commission  to  disseminate  licenses  among  a  wide  variety  of  applicants,  including  small  businesses  and  other  designated 
 entities.  226  Section  309(  j)  also  requires  that  the  Commission  ensure  the  development  and  rapid  deployment  of  new  technologies,  products,  and  services  for  the  benefit  of  the  public,  and  recover  for  the 
 public  a  portion  of  the  value  of  the  public  spectrum  resource  made  available  for  commercial  use.  227  The  Commission  believes  that  the  C  Block  Fourth  Report  and  Order  promotes  these  goals  while  maintaining 
 the  fair  and  efficient  execution  of  the  auctions  program. 
 F.  Report  to  Congress 
 The  Commission  will  send  a  copy  of  the  C  Block  Fourth  Report  and  Order,  including  this  FRFA,  in  a  report  to  Congress  pursuant  to  the  Small  Business  Regulatory  Enforcement  Fairness  Act  of  1996. 
 See  5  U.  S.  C.  §  801(  a)(  1)(  A).  A  copy  of  the  C  Block  Fourth  Report  and  Order  and  this  FRFA  (or  summary  thereof)  will  be  published  in  the  Federal  Register.  See  5  U.  S.  C.  §  604(  b).  A  copy  of  the  C 
 Block  Fourth  Report  and  Order  and  this  FRFA  will  also  be  sent  to  the  Chief  Counsel  for  Advocacy  of  the  Small  Business  Administration.
