      <p>Like many of my colleagues in academic medicine, I caught my first whiff 
        of science from popular books about men and microbes. By the time we had 
        finished high school, most of us had read and often reread Paul de Kruif's 
        Microbe Hunters; Sinclair Lewis' Arrowsmith; and Rats, Lice and History 
        by Hans Zinsser. It's hard nowadays to reread the work of de Kruif or 
        Sinclair Lewis without a chuckle or two over their quaint locution, but 
        Zinsser's <i>raffiné</i> account of lice and men remains a delight. Written 
        in 1935 as a latter-day variation on Laurence Sterne's The Life and Opinions 
        of Tristam Shandy, Zinsser's book gives a picaresque account of how the 
        history of the world has been shaped by epidemics of louseborne typhus. 
        He sounded a tocsin against microbes in the days before antibiotics, and 
        his challenge remains meaningful today: &quot;Infectious disease is one 
        of the few genuine adventures left in the world. The dragons are all dead 
        and the lance grows rusty in the chimney corner. . . . About the only 
        sporting proposition that remains unimpaired by the relentless domestication 
        of a once free-living human species is the war against those ferocious 
        little fellow creatures, which lurk in dark corners and stalk us in the 
        bodies of rats, mice and all kinds of domestic animals; which fly and 
        crawl with the insects, and waylay us in our food and drink and even in 
        our love&quot; (<a href="#1">1</a>).</p>
      <p>Despite the unwieldy subtitle &quot;Being a study in biography, which, 
        after twelve preliminary chapters indispensable for the preparation of 
        the lay reader, deals with the life history of TYPHUS FEVER,&quot; Rats, 
        Lice and History became an international critical and commercial success. 
        Zinsser's romp through the ancient and modern worlds describes how epidemics 
        devastated the Byzantines under Justinian, put Charles V atop the Holy 
        Roman Empire, stopped the Turks at the Carpathians, and turned Napoleon's 
        <i>Grand Armée</i> back from Moscow. He explains how the louse, the ubiquitous 
        vector of typhus, was for most of human history an inevitable part of 
        existence, &quot;like baptism, or smallpox&quot;; its habitat extended 
        from hovel to throne. And after that Murder in the Cathedral, the vectors 
        deserted Thomas à Becket: &quot;The archbishop was murdered in Canterbury 
        Cathedral on the evening of the twenty-ninth of December [1170]. The body 
        lay in the Cathedral all night, and was prepared for burial on the following 
        day…. He had on a large brown mantle; under it, a white surplice; below 
        that, a lamb's-wool coat; then another woolen coat; and a third woolen 
        coat below this; under this, there was the black, cowled robe of the Benedictine 
        Order; under this, a shirt; and next to the body a curious hair-cloth, 
        covered with linen. As the body grew cold, the vermin that were living 
        in this multiple covering started to crawl out, and, as … the chronicler 
        quoted, 'The vermin boiled over like water in a simmering cauldron, and 
        the onlookers burst into alternate weeping and laughter …'&quot;(<a href="#1">1</a>).</p>
      <p>Zinsser's literary range and magpie intellect prompted reviewers of the 
        day to compare him to an earlier Harvard Medical School author, Oliver 
        Wendell Holmes. Indeed, the first few chapters of Rats, Lice and History 
        sound a lot like Holmes' The Autocrat of the Breakfast Table. Both works 
        offer clean drafts of political and poetic history &quot;dipped from the 
        running stream of consciousness&quot;—to use Holmes' phrase, later made 
        famous by William James. Rats, Lice and History is still in print, but 
        it's playing to a different audience. A Yale academic worries that readers 
        &quot;may be puzzled by the acerbic references to the literary dandies 
        of the interwar period&quot; (<a href="#1">2</a>), while a scroll down 
        Amazon.com yields another complaint: &quot;Some of the writing assumes 
        that all readers were educated under an aristocratic university system, 
        so that there are bits thrown in Latin and Greek, not to mention French 
        and other modern languages&quot; (<a href="#1">3</a>). Be that as it may, 
        Zinsser's assumption of an &quot;aristocratic university system&quot; 
        did not prevent the book from becoming a best-seller in 1935 or from undergoing 
        75 subsequent printings. And as for those literary dandies: T.S. Eliot? 
        Gertrude Stein? Lewis Mumford? Edmund Wilson?</p>
      <p>Zinsser followed up with As I Remember Him: The Biography of R.S., a 
        third-person autobiography that survives as a distinguished work of literature. 
        The R.S. in the title is an abbreviation of &quot;Romantic Self,&quot; 
        or the last letters, inverted, of Hans Zinsser's first and last names. 
        In it, the author spells out his warm view of medicine as a learned profession: 
        &quot;There is in it a balanced education of the mind and of the spirit 
        which, in those strong enough to take it, hardens the intellect and deepens 
        the sympathy for human suffering and misfortune&quot; (<a href="#1">4</a>).</p>
      <p>As I Remember Him was written 2 years before Zinsser's death at age 61 
        of lymphatic leukemia in 1940. A selection of Book of the Month Club, 
        it reached the best-seller list as its author lay dying. News of its warm 
        reception by book reviewers filtered into the obituaries. The volume was 
        widely popular among doctors of my father's generation; the copy I first 
        read sat on his office shelves, wedged between Axel Munthe's The Story 
        of San Michele and Romain Rolland's Jean-Christophe.</p>
      <p>As I Remember Him tells the story of Zinsser and his cohort of American 
        physicians, who &quot;were more fortunate than they knew, because they 
        were about to participate in a professional evolution with few parallels&quot; 
        (<a href="#1">4</a>). Zinsser lived to see American medicine develop from 
        a &quot;relatively primitive dependence upon European thought to its present 
        magnificent vigor&quot; (<a href="#1">4</a>). He describes how over the 
        years the torch of medical science passed from England to France to Germany. 
        The flow of American medical students followed its path, which had led 
        in central Europe to &quot;a powerful reaction of the basic sciences upon 
        medical training and a true spirit of research [that] pervaded medical 
        laboratories and clinics&quot; (<a href="#1">4</a>). The Golden Age of 
        German medicine ended abruptly in 1933 when, as Zinsser lamented, &quot;common 
        sense became counter-revolution.&quot;</p>
      <p>Zinsser, a New Yorker, was of German liberal stock of the 1848 generation. 
        &quot;The spirit of this age of my German grandfathers was one of growing 
        philosophical materialism and the <i>Freie Deutsche Gemeinde</i> (free 
        German communities) or 'ethical culture societies' of the sort carried 
        on for many years by Felix Adler&quot; (<a href="#1">4</a>). Zinsser's 
        father, a free-thinking industrial chemist, raised him in a cultivated 
        Westchester home, with trips abroad, private tutors, music, and riding 
        lessons. He prepped for Columbia at a small private school (now the Dwight 
        School) on 59th Street, run on ethical culture lines by Dr. Julius Sachs. 
        At Columbia College, he fell under the spell of George Woodberry, the 
        Mark van Doren of his day, and became enchanted by the poet and essayist 
        who had been hailed &quot;the American Shelley&quot; by James Russell 
        Lowell. Woodberry introduced Zinsser to New England enlightenment and 
        sparked his lifelong love affair with poetry.</p>
      <p>Zinsser's Columbia years reinforced his distrust of credulity, later 
        strengthened by the skepticism of German enlightenment as interpreted 
        by H.L. Mencken. Heine, the skeptic, was the Zinsser family hero, and 
        Zinsser often repeated the poet's final words. Asked to turn to God, that 
        He might pardon him at death, Heine had replied, &quot;God will forgive 
        me. It's his business.&quot; It was in this spirit that Zinsser differed 
        from William James. &quot;I have been utterly incapable of that 'over-belief' 
        which William James postulates as necessary to faith. Moreover, to give 
        religious experience—as he does—a merely pragmatic value seems both to 
        be begging the question and to be making light of a grave problem&quot; 
        (<a href="#1">4</a>).</p>
      <p>At Columbia, Zinsser may have fallen under the spell of Woodberry in 
        the humanities, but in science, his mentor was Edmund B. Wilson (no relation 
        to the writer). Zinsser vastly admired Wilson, a founder of developmental 
        genetics in the United States. Wilson and his assistants, Zinsser knew, 
        were the direct spiritual offspring of the Darwinian period; they had 
        known Haeckel and Huxley. Wilson himself had described how chromosomes 
        divide before cell cleavage and are united in pairs in the new cells. 
        Zinsser became a convert to experimental biology after many hours in Wilson's 
        cytology laboratories and entered Columbia's College of Physicians and 
        Surgeons in 1903. Two of his contemporaries in the class of 1904 were 
        his future colleagues in bacteriology, Oswald Avery, who went on to prove 
        that bare DNA was the stuff of genes, and Joseph Thomas, father of Lewis 
        Thomas.</p>
      <p>Zinsser cut his teeth on research while still in medical school, earning 
        an M.A. in embryology and studying the effects of radium on bacterial 
        survival. (I wonder about the relationship between radium research in 
        those early days and Zinsser's leukemia). His record earned him a prized 
        internship at Roosevelt Hospital, then the primary teaching hospital of 
        Columbia. Zinsser and other house officers at Roosevelt lived in a small 
        world of their own, sharing the hazing rituals of medical training and 
        &quot;walking out,&quot; as dating was then called, chiefly with Roosevelt 
        nurses, among them Grace Peck: &quot;An interne [sic] who doesn't sooner 
        or later fall in love with a nurse is usually a depraved fellow&quot; 
        (<a href="#1">4</a>).</p>
      <p>The Roosevelt house officers in those days worked the wards and clinics 
        and rode ambulances. William Carlos Williams was also an intern at Roosevelt, 
        and his accounts of Hell's Kitchen (<a href="#1">5</a>) jibe with those 
        of Zinsser. Zinsser's tale of answering a 2 a.m. call to a tenement house 
        could be set as the beginning of a Williams poem: I found a man/Who had 
        been shot in the chest./He was lying diagonally/across a small room/lighted 
        by a single gas burner./He was bleeding heavily into his clothes/He also 
        had a scalp wound/Which bled profusely./My business was to get him to 
        the hospital . . ./I got him there alive . . . but he died (<a href="#1">4</a>).</p>
      <p>Zinsser picked up at Columbia what William Carlos Williams had acquired 
        at Penn: the spirit of pragmatic humanism that flourished in the &quot;aristocratic&quot; 
        American universities of John Dewey's era. Williams' &quot;No ideas but 
        in things&quot; became an anthem of the generation. Its direct predecessor 
        was James Russell Lowell's postbellum &quot;Commemoration Ode.&quot; Zinsser 
        would have seen a connection between William's plea for truth in things 
        and Lowell's ode to veritas: &quot;No lore of Greece or Rome/No science 
        peddling with the names of things,/Or reading stars to find inglorious 
        fates,/Can lift our life with wings . . . /But rather far that stern device,/The 
        sponsors chose that round thy cradle stood/In the dim, unventured wood,/The 
        Veritas that lurks beneath/The letters unprolific sheath….&quot; (<a href="#1">6</a>).</p>
      <p>Medical schools stopped peddling with the names of things and started 
        looking for veritas in the laboratory soon after the Flexner report of 
        1910. &quot;Oh, Abraham Flexner!&quot; Zinsser intoned, &quot;We hail 
        you the father—or, better the uncle—of modern medical education&quot; 
        (<a href="#1">4</a>).<sup><a href="#1f">1</a></sup> Flexner's exposé of 
        the practitioner-dominated medical diploma mills that flourished at the 
        turn of the century was the critical step in making American doctors members 
        of a learned profession. Before then, it was all words, words, words and 
        precious little experience; medical students sat on benches rather than 
        working at them. After Flexner, American medical schools embarked on a 
        century-long effort at empirical, laboratory-based medical instruction 
        that became the envy of the world, &quot;a phoenix rising.&quot; Zinsser 
        would not be pleased that nowadays, as in 1933 Germany, common sense is 
        again becoming a victim of counter-revolution. In our culture of HMOs, 
        healthcare providers, insurance scams, and for-profit hospital chains, 
        he'd worry that the phoenix of our youngest science might return to the 
        &quot;ill-smelling ashes of a big business&quot; (<a href="#1">4</a>).</p>
      <p>When their days at Roosevelt Hospital were over, William Carlos Williams 
        became a pediatrician in Rutherford, New Jersey; Joseph Thomas entered 
        medical practice in Flushing; and Zinsser became a microbe hunter in academia. 
        In 1915, he accompanied the American Red Cross Sanitary Commission to 
        investigate a devastating outbreak of typhus in Siberia. After much trial 
        and error, he eventually succeeded in isolating the European form of the 
        microbe that caused typhus and worked hard at developing a vaccine against 
        it. He also moved rapidly into the new science of immunology (<a href="#1">7</a>).</p>
      <p>Zinsser's scientific gifts were not limited to microbe hunting. He became 
        a prolific medical writer and editor. His Textbook of Bacteriology went 
        through many editions. From 1928 to 1940, he regularly published poems 
        in the journal first edited by James Russel Lowell and named by Holmes, 
        the Atlantic Monthly. Zinsser later explained that his cultural life bridged 
        &quot;the period between Emerson and Longfellow to T.S. Eliot and James 
        Joyce&quot; (<a href="#1">7</a>).</p>
      <p>After faculty positions at Stanford and Columbia, Zinsser was appointed 
        to the chair at Harvard in 1923. Harvard at the time was a phoenix rising 
        and its dean, David Linn Edsall, could truly report to his trustees that 
        &quot;There can be little doubt that the school has acquired the standing 
        of being the best place in the country and perhaps anywhere for advanced 
        training in research and for advanced training of teaching and research 
        personnel&quot; (<a href="#1">8</a>).</p>
      <p>Until the Flexnerian revolution came to Boston, indeed from the time 
        of its founding in 1782, Harvard's Medical School had functioned chiefly 
        as a cozy nursery for Yankee practitioners. In the days of Holmes' deanship 
        (1847–1853), the school offered little encouragement for laboratory research 
        to either faculty or students. In 1870, Holmes' clinical colleague James 
        Clark White urged rigorous standards of laboratory and bedside teaching—matching 
        those of Paris, Berlin, or Vienna—in Boston, at Harvard Medical School: 
        &quot;When I find the young men of Europe flocking to our shores and crowding 
        our native students from their seats and from the bedside, when the fees 
        of our best lecturers are mostly paid in foreign coin, and when thousands 
        of wealthy invalids from across the sea fill the waiting-rooms of our 
        physicians, then I will confess that I am wrong, and that of the two systems 
        of education ours is the best. Until then I shall seek in the spirit and 
        working of their schools the secret of their success, the cause of our 
        failings&quot; (<a href="#1">9</a>).</p>
      <p>Its provincial air had prompted the taunt that Harvard was the best medical 
        school in Boston. But by the 1920s, thanks to a new campus, a crop of 
        young, full-time professors, and an ebullient Dean Edsall, innovation 
        was in the air. Rote learning had largely yielded to learning by doing, 
        electives had sprouted, experimental spirit had spread to the clinics, 
        and Harvard was well on its way to becoming the best medical school in 
        the country.</p>
      <p>Edsall, a close friend and advisor to Flexner, assumed the deanship in 
        1918. He took medical education as a personal challenge and set about 
        recasting Harvard into a world-renowned academic medical center. Frugal 
        Edsall told of snaring Zinsser from New York, bragging that &quot;we got 
        this professor for $2,000 less than we could have because of [his] personal 
        income and because he wanted to come here&quot; (<a href="#1">8</a>).</p>
      <p>The &quot;here&quot; to which Edsall brought Zinsser in 1926 was the 
        neoclassic campus north of the Charles. Its open piazza was framed by 
        buildings well-endowed with laboratory space for students and faculty. 
        Edsall's medical acropolis attracted Zinsser, Otto Folin, Edwin Cohn, 
        and John Edsall (the dean's son) in biochemistry; Lawrence Henderson and 
        Walter B. Cannon in physiology; and S. Burt Wolbach and Tracy Mallory 
        in pathology. Among the clinicians were William B. Castle, Soma Weiss, 
        Herman Blumgart, and Maxwell Finland. Other contemporaries included future 
        Harvard Nobelists John F. Enders, Thomas Weller, George Minot, William 
        P. Murphy, and George Hitchings. Zinsser was in tune with Edsall's social 
        views; despite internal opposition, the dean had appointed Alice Hamilton 
        (1869–1970), a pioneer of industrial medicine, first woman assistant professor, 
        not only in the medical school but in all of Harvard University (<a href="#1">10</a>).</p>
      <p>Zinsser's scientific career flourished at Harvard. His work on typhus 
        carried him to Mexico and China. In Mexico, he went after the <i>Rickettsia 
        prowasekii</i> that caused disease, and he worked out innumerable approaches 
        to a vaccine. He also detailed the epidemiology of a recurrent variant 
        of typhus in European immigrants (Brill-Zinsser disease). Zinsser's work 
        on typhus in Serbia, Mexico, and China spelled it out: lice require dirty 
        humans, bad weather, and crowding—as in tents and barracks. That's why 
        typhus is the stuff of war and tragedies and has, as he predicted, outlived 
        Hans Zinsser. During World War II, typhus spread through North Africa 
        and the Pacific Islands and devastated central Europe, where it was the 
        second leading cause of death in German concentration camps. On or about 
        March 31, 1945, typhus killed Anne Frank in Bergen-Belsen, only two weeks 
        before the British Army came in to stamp out the lice (<a href="#11">11</a>). 
        American troops were protected by a vaccine based on the one developed 
        by Zinsser and Castaneda and applied on a large scale. Although epidemic 
        typhus declined at the end of World War II with the advent of DDT (<a href="#11">12</a>), 
        <i>R. prowasekii</i> is making a comeback. The largest recent outbreak 
        since World War II was in Burundi in the mid–90s, where modern molecular 
        techniques were used to show that a single outbreak of &quot;jail fever&quot; 
        sparked an extensive epidemic of louseborne typhus in the refugee camps 
        of Rwanda, Burundi, and Zaire—countries racked by ongoing civil war and 
        genocide (<a href="#11">13</a>). There was also a brisk outbreak in Russia 
        in 1997. In Europe in the past and Africa today, persons who &quot;recovered&quot; 
        from the epidemic typhus of their youth suffer relapses of Brill-Zinsser 
        disease and have become a reservoir of new louse-borne epidemics (<a href="#11">12</a>).</p>
      <p>Work on typhus was not Zinsser's only contribution. He was also a pioneer 
        in the study of autoimmunity, our allergy to self induced by microbes. 
        He was drawn to its study by the leading cause of cardiac disease in the 
        interbellum years, rheumatic fever. Zinsser had been studying allergy 
        to the streptococcus for several years, and in 1925 published a seminal 
        hypothesis, now accepted wisdom. Entitled &quot;Further Studies on Bacterial 
        Allergy: Allergic Reactions to the Hemolytic Streptococcus,&quot; it argued 
        that, &quot;Failure to find the organisms themselves . . . suggested either 
        a toxic or allergic pathogenesis. Such reasoning is especially applicable 
        to the various forms of arthritis, in which it is at least logical to 
        think of an allergic association&quot; (<a href="#11">14</a>).</p>
      <p>We now know that &quot;autoimmune&quot; reactions to the microbe are 
        responsible, but we are still in the dark as to how the disease comes 
        about. It remained for Zinsser's student, Albert Coons to put us on the 
        right track. Zinsser would have been pleased. In brief, Coons found that 
        if a fluorescent molecule were chemically hooked to purified antibody, 
        this labeled antibody could be added to samples of tissue to find the 
        suspected antigen (<a href="#11">15</a>). This powerful method, immunofluorescence, 
        was discovered by Coons and Melvin Kaplan in the 1950s to test Zinsser's 
        suggestion that rheumatic disease is due to what might be called friendly 
        fire: our immune defenses against the microbe are launched against our 
        own tissues because the strep and we share look-alike components. The 
        immune system is therefore tricked into treating the host as if it were 
        as invader that requires disposal. Zinsser laid the groundwork for much 
        of what we know, or think we know, of rheumatic diseases today.</p>
      <p>Zinsser was as fine a teacher as he was a scientist. His infectious enthusiasm 
        for pure science brought him the best and brightest students, who eventually 
        filled chairs of bacteriology, immunology, medicine, and public health 
        the world over and transmitted Zinsser's broad, humanistic concerns to 
        their students. Lewis Thomas was one of those vectors, and I confess that 
        I get twinges of what might be called a Brill-Zinsser recurrence of sentiment 
        when I'm asked about a lifetime of teaching in medical school: &quot;…as 
        we grow wiser we learn that the relatively small fractions of our time 
        which we spend with well-trained, intelligent young men are more of a 
        privilege than an obligation. For these groups are highly selected and 
        they force a teacher continually to renew the fundamental principles of 
        the sciences from which his specialty takes off. So while we are, technically 
        speaking, professors, we are actually older colleagues of our students, 
        from whom we often learn as much as we teach them&quot; (<a href="#1">4</a>).</p>
      <p>Zinsser died of a hematologic malignancy. The last chapter of As I Remember 
        Him forecasts in stoic detail the events of Zinsser's terminal illness. 
        He writes of himself in the third person: &quot;As his disease caught 
        up with him, R.S. felt increasingly grateful for the fact that death was 
        coming to him with due warning, and gradually. So many times in his active 
        life he had been near sudden death by accident, violence, or acute disease…. 
        But now he was thankful that he had time to compose his spirit, and to 
        spend a last year in affectionate and actually merry association with 
        those dear to him&quot; (<a href="#1">4</a>).</p>
      <p>Zinsser's legacy is indelible in the two cultures of writing and science; 
        his well-written books remain in print, and we live with his science. 
        He taught us how we get typhus, created a successful vaccine against it, 
        and told us how it can recur as Brill-Zinsser disease. He was the first 
        to reckon that rheumatic diseases result from the friendly fire of our 
        own armaments against microbes. But, his finest contribution was to warn 
        us, from the field, from the podium, and in his writing, that &quot;lice, 
        ticks, mosquitoes and bedbugs will always lurk in the shadows when neglect, 
        poverty, famine or war lets down the defenses&quot; (<a href="#1">1</a>). 
        The shadows remain.</p>
