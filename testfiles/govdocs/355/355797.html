      <P><B>SUBJECT:</B> <I>The Role of Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) as Part 
      of the Enforcement Process</I> (Audit Report No. 03-038)</P>
      <P>This report presents the results of an audit we conducted to determine 
      whether the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) provisions were used as part of 
      the FDIC’s enforcement process and served to reduce the losses to the 
      deposit insurance funds. This is a follow-up audit to our earlier report 
      entitled <I>The Effectiveness of Prompt Corrective Action Provisions in 
      Preventing or Reducing Losses to the Deposit Insurance Funds</I>, dated 
      March 26, 2002. Our earlier audit focused on determining whether prompt 
      corrective action provisions were implemented in a timely manner for 
      Superior Bank (Superior), First National Bank of Keystone (Keystone), and 
      Pacific Thrift &amp; Loan Company (PTL) and whether those actions 
      prevented or reduced losses to the insurance funds.</P>
      <P>Pursuant to our earlier audit, and in consultation with the FDIC’s 
      Divisions of Supervision and Consumer Protection (DSC) and Resolutions and 
      Receiverships (DRR), we expanded our work to a larger sample of 11 
      FDIC-supervised institutions to address our stated objectives. We selected 
      a sample of failed as well as open institutions so that we could determine 
      whether PCA provisions were used or should have been used. (Note: 
      Throughout this report, we use the term failed banks to mean banks closed 
      as well as ones acquired by other banks.) See Appendix I for the list of 
      11 institutions that we reviewed. (Note: As of May 31, 2003, six of these 
      banks were closed, two had been acquired, and three remained open. To 
      protect the identity of the open institutions, we refer to them throughout 
      our report as Open Banks #1, #2, and #3.)</P>
      <P>In performing this audit, we conducted case studies of the 11 
      institutions to gain insight into the use of PCA provisions and their 
      relation to the other elements of the FDIC’s supervisory authority. 
      Appendix II provides additional details on our objectives, scope, and 
      methodology. We also shared our case histories with the DSC, Legal 
      Division, Division of Insurance and Research (DIR), and DRR. In addition, 
      we shared a working draft of this report with the DSC, DRR, DIR, and Legal 
      Division. We have included their comments, where appropriate.</P>
      <H4>BACKGROUND</H4>
      <P>In response to the criticism that federal banking regulators were not 
      taking prompt and forceful action to minimize or prevent losses to the 
      insurance funds stemming from bank and thrift failures, the Congress 
      passed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 
      (FDICIA), Public Law 102-242, to improve the supervision and examination 
      of depository institutions and protect the insurance funds from further 
      losses.</P>
      <P>FDICIA’s Prompt Regulatory Action provisions created two new sections 
      in the Federal Deposit Insurance Act—sections 38 and 39, codified to 12 
      U.S.C. §1831o and 1831p-1—which required that regulators establish a 
      two-part regulatory framework to improve safeguards for the deposit 
      insurance funds. Enactment of this two-part system was intended to 
      increase the likelihood that regulators would respond promptly and 
      forcefully to prevent or minimize losses to the deposit insurance 
      funds.</P>
      <P>The first part of the framework, Section 38, <I>Prompt Corrective 
      Action</I>, of the FDI Act requires federal regulators to place depository 
      institutions into one of five categories on the basis of their capital 
      levels and mandates increasingly severe restrictions and supervisory 
      actions as an institution’s capital condition deteriorates. (Note: A 
      bank’s primary federal regulator is determined by the bank’s charter and 
      the status of membership in the Federal Reserve System. The FDIC is the 
      primary federal regulator for state-chartered banks that are not members 
      of the Federal Reserve System. The Office of the Comptroller of the 
      Currency (OCC) is the primary federal regulator for all national banks. 
      The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB) is the primary 
      federal regulator for state-chartered banks that are members of the 
      Federal Reserve System. The Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) is the 
      primary federal regulator for federal and state-chartered savings 
      associations.) The section further requires regulators to define 
      capital-level criteria for four of the five categories. The four 
      categories are identified as well capitalized, adequately capitalized, 
      undercapitalized, and significantly undercapitalized. Regulators must also 
      set the threshold for the fifth category, which is identified as 
      critically undercapitalized, at no less than 2 percent of tangible equity 
      capital. (Note: See Appendix V for a glossary of terms.) Section 38 
      establishes a system of restrictions and mandatory supervisory actions 
      that are to be triggered by an institution’s capital levels. For example, 
      regulators are required to obtain capital restoration plans from 
      undercapitalized institutions and to monitor the implementation of 
      approved plans.</P>
      <P>The regulators are generally required to close critically 
      undercapitalized institutions within a 90-day period. In addition, without 
      the FDIC’s prior written approval, section 38 restricts depository 
      institutions in the three lowest capital categories from engaging in 
      certain activities such as acquisition of branches or new lines of 
      business that could increase the risk of losses to the deposit insurance 
      funds.</P>
      <P>The second part of the framework, Section 39, <I>Standards for Safety 
      and Soundness</I>, directs regulatory attention to the non-capital areas 
      of an institution’s activities as they relate to safety and soundness. The 
      section requires regulators to develop and implement safety-and-soundness 
      standards in three areas: (1) operations and management; (2) asset 
      quality, earnings, and stock valuation; and (3) compensation. See Appendix 
      III for additional background discussion of sections 38 and 39. </P>
      <H4>RESULTS OF AUDIT</H4>
      <P>The FDIC generally used PCA directives as part of the supervisory 
      process, in conjunction with other supervisory actions, once institutions’ 
      capital levels reached designated thresholds. (Note: Throughout this 
      report, we use the term PCA directive to mean a Notice of Capital Category 
      or a PCA directive issued to the institutions. Both are used to implement 
      section 38 provisions.) Specifically, the FDIC used PCA directives in 8 (7 
      failed and 1 open) of 11 institutions that we reviewed, and its use of PCA 
      served to prevent or reduce losses to the deposit insurance funds. Prior 
      to the enactment of section 38, there was no mandate to close an 
      institution before its capital was depleted. However, this section 
      generally instituted a requirement that regulators close institutions when 
      their tangible equity drops to 2 percent or less of their total assets. 
      Because of PCA directives, insurance fund losses were prevented in two 
      institutions when other institutions acquired them. In four other 
      institutions, insurance fund losses were reduced when institutions were 
      closed before they became insolvent.</P>
      <P>PCA directives were used in 8 of 11 institutions in our sample; 
      however, we identified a number of factors that delay the use of section 
      38 and impact the effectiveness of its capital-related provisions. 
      Specifically:</P>
      <UL>
        <LI>PCA’s focus is on capital, and because capital can be a lagging 
        indicator of an institution’s financial health, a bank’s capital can 
        remain in the “well to adequate” range long after its operations have 
        begun to deteriorate from problems with management, asset quality, or 
        internal controls. Our review of seven failed institutions for which the 
        FDIC issued PCA directives showed that for those seven cases, one or 
        more examinations revealed deteriorating conditions in various aspects 
        of bank operations before capital began to deteriorate.<BR><BR>
        <LI>Capital ratios reported by institutions in their Call Reports did 
        not always reflect actual financial conditions. Capital ratios for PCA 
        purposes are reported every quarter by institutions in their Call 
        Reports. However, apart from some edits and validation checks, the FDIC 
        verifies the accuracy of this information only during examinations. 
        Consequently, depending on whether an institution’s examination cycle is 
        12 or 18 months, erroneous or intentionally misleading financial 
        information may go undetected by the FDIC for a period of a year or 
        more. We observed that for nine institutions, the FDIC lowered the 
        capital categories reported by the banks in Call Reports by one or more 
        levels during examinations.<BR><BR>
        <LI>Institutions increased their capital before or after the issuance of 
        PCA directives and thus avoided implementation of PCA directives or 
        closure. Various means were used to increase capital – assets were sold, 
        income was transferred from another affiliate, in-kind capital was 
        contributed, and cash was injected. These forms of capital infusion are 
        accepted business practices, and additional capital strengthens the 
        financial condition of institutions. Infusions can, nevertheless, 
        temporarily delay the institutions’ capital levels from triggering PCA 
        directives. In other cases, infusions can increase the capital levels 
        above the threshold after a PCA directive has been issued.<BR><BR>
        <LI>The current method of computing capital does not take into account 
        risks related to subprime loans. That is, the federal banking regulators 
        currently do not require institutions in their Call Reports to 
        risk-weight subprime loans commensurate with the risks associated with 
        those loans. Consequently, the capital ratios reported in Call Reports 
        for institutions engaged in subprime lending might be overstated, thus 
        delaying the initiation of PCA provisions. </LI></UL>
      <P>Although the primary focus of section 38 is capital, sections 38 and 39 
      also provide for certain actions based on non-capital factors to 
      facilitate the issuance of PCA directives or to address non-capital 
      problems. Specifically, section 38(g) allows regulators to reclassify the 
      capital categories of institutions based on non-capital factors. However, 
      the FDIC did not use this provision for any of the institutions in our 
      sample. Also, section 38(f)(2)(F) authorizes the regulatory agencies to 
      require an institution to improve management when the regulators consider 
      management to be deficient. The FDIC used this provision in 2 of the 11 
      institutions we reviewed. Finally, section 39 provides for regulators to 
      require a compliance plan from institutions when regulators identify 
      problems with operations, management, asset quality, earnings, stock 
      valuation, and compensation. The FDIC used this provision in 1 of the 11 
      institutions. Our analyses of the sections indicated that these provisions 
      do not provide objective or measurable criteria for implementation and, in 
      some instances, placed restrictions on their use. Consequently, these 
      provisions were seldom used, and the FDIC may have lost opportunities to 
      initiate additional supervisory actions to address problems.</P>
      <H4>SECTION 38 CAPITAL-RELATED PROVISIONS</H4>
      <P><B>PCA DIRECTIVES WERE PART OF THE FDIC’S SUPERVISORY PROCESS AND 
      PREVENTED OR REDUCED LOSSES TO THE DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUNDS</B></P>
      <P>Of the 11 institutions that we reviewed, the FDIC used PCA directives 
      as part of the enforcement process in 8 of these institutions after their 
      capital levels reached designated thresholds. Use of the PCA directives 
      served to prevent or reduce losses to the deposit insurance funds. Section 
      38(c) created a capital-based framework for bank and thrift oversight that 
      places financial institutions into one of five capital categories. Section 
      38 also restricts depository institutions in the three lowest capital 
      categories from engaging in certain activities such as acquisition of 
      branches or new lines of business that could increase the risk of losses 
      to the federal deposit insurance funds. Further, this section also 
      established a system of mandatory supervisory actions that are to be 
      triggered at the three lowest capital levels—undercapitalized, 
      significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized. </P>

      <P>Source: OIG analysis of institutions infor which PCA directives were 
      used.</P>
      <P>Of the remaining three institutions, a PCA directive was not used for 
      one failed institution, the Bank of Falkner, because it was closed 
      immediately after the detection of accounting improprieties. The other two 
      institutions are open, and the FDIC had not used PCA directives because 
      the institutions’ capital levels had not reached the thresholds that 
      require such action.</P>
      <P>Use of PCA directives served to prevent or reduce losses to the deposit 
      insurance funds. Prior to the enactment of section 38, there was no 
      mandate to close an institution before the institution’s capital was 
      depleted. Section 38 generally requires regulators to close institutions 
      when their tangible equity drops to 2 percent or less of their total 
      assets, thereby reducing instances of seriously troubled institutions 
      compounding their losses by continuing to operate. Therefore, institution 
      management sought a buyer for institutions with less than 2 percent 
      tangible equity, which prevented losses to the deposit insurance funds. 
      When institutions with less than 2 percent tangible equity were closed, 
      the decision was made to close the banks before they became insolvent, 
      thus minimizing losses to the deposit insurance funds. </P>
      <P>One of the factors that section 38 was meant to address was excessive 
      forbearance of federal regulators. Prior to enactment of this section, the 
      banking regulators had wide discretion in choosing the severity and timing 
      of enforcement actions that they took against depository institutions with 
      unsafe and unsound practices. In its report issued in 1991, the U.S. 
      General Accounting Office (GAO) noted that regulators had a common 
      philosophy of trying to work informally and cooperatively with troubled 
      institutions. (Note: See GAO/GGD-91-26, entitled Bank Supervision: Prompt 
      and Forceful Regulatory Action Needed, dated April 15, 1991.) This 
      approach, in combination with regulators’ wide discretion in the oversight 
      of financial institutions, had resulted in enforcement actions that were 
      neither timely nor forceful enough to (1) correct unsafe and unsound 
      banking practices or (2) prevent or minimize losses to the deposit 
      insurance funds.</P>
      <P>In addressing this situation, section 38 removed some regulatory 
      discretion by requiring stringent action to be taken against critically 
      undercapitalized institutions. After an institution becomes critically 
      undercapitalized, PCA gives the regulators 90 days to either place the 
      institution into receivership or conservatorship or take other action that 
      would better prevent or minimize long-term losses to the insurance funds. 
      </P>
      <P>In addition, in its report issued in 1996, the GAO stated that 
      according to regulators and banking industry analysts, section 38 provides 
      depository institutions with strong incentives to raise additional equity 
      capital. (Note: See GAO/GGD 97-18, entitled Bank and Thrift Regulation – 
      Implementation of FDICIA’s Prompt Regulatory Action Provisions, dated 
      November 21, 1996.) These officials explained that financial institutions 
      were concerned about the potential ramifications of becoming 
      undercapitalized. Also, once the implementing regulations were issued, 
      depository institutions had clear benchmarks as to the levels of capital 
      they needed to achieve to avoid mandatory regulatory intervention. </P>
      <P>Attempting to compute savings resulting from the use of PCA directives 
      would be very complex and require making numerous assumptions and 
      estimations. However, the requirement that institutions be closed within 
      90 days of reaching 2 percent tangible equity provides a means to observe 
      whether the institutions were acquired or closed before they became 
      insolvent. Of the eight failed institutions in our sample, the FDIC used 
      PCA directives in seven institutions as discussed earlier. Our 
      observations regarding (1) the time lapse between the use of PCA 
      directives and the closure or acquisition and (2) capital available at the 
      time the banks were closed are presented in Table 2.</P>
      <P><B>Table 2: Time Lapse Between Use of PCA Directives and 
      Closure/Acquisition and Capital Available at the Time of Closure</B> 
      (Note: Capital amounts in Table 2 were as of the date of bank closure. The 
      final loss to the insurance funds depends on the proceeds received from 
      the sale of assets available at closure.)</P>

      <P>Source: OIG analysis of institutions in which the FDIC issued a PCA 
      directive.</P>
      <P>Analysis of these banks indicates that six out of seven institutions 
      closed within 7 months after the FDIC used a PCA directive. In the case of 
      the seventh bank, the Bank of Sierra Blanca, the bank’s directors made 
      three capital injections over a 9-month period, thus extending the 
      eventual closure to 17 months. Of the 7 failed banks, two banks were 
      acquired by other institutions, without financial assistance from the 
      FDIC, after PCA directives were used and the directives thus served to 
      prevent losses to the insurance funds. Of the remaining five banks, four 
      were closed after PCA directives were used but before they became 
      insolvent. For the remaining bank—Bank of Sierra Blanca—the FDIC gave 45 
      days to submit a revised capital plan after the bank was identified as 
      “critically undercapitalized.” However, a subsequent review by the bank’s 
      data processing servicer led to the identification of $452,000 in 
      liabilities that had not been properly reflected on the bank’s balance 
      sheet. As a result, the bank’s capital had eroded by the time the bank was 
      closed. </P>
      <P>In summary, the FDIC was able to prevent fund losses in two banks that 
      were acquired by other institutions and minimize the losses for four banks 
      by closing them before they became insolvent. Had it not been for the PCA 
      provisions, which required action by the regulators when the tangible 
      capital dropped to 2 percent, there was a possibility that these banks 
      would have been allowed to operate until their equity was totally depleted 
      or they became insolvent.</P>
      <P><B>Contents of Text Box:</B> By setting the closure of banks to 2 
      percent capital instead of insolvency, troubled banks begin their 
      last-ditch efforts to recapitalize or merge earlier than they did prior to 
      FDICIA. This increases the chances that their efforts to find a private 
      sector solution and avoid failure will succeed.</P>

      <P><B>OTHER SUPERVISORY ACTIONS TAKEN PRIOR TO THE ISSUANCE OF PCA 
      DIRECTIVES</B></P>
      <P>During the periods leading up to the issuance of PCA directives in the 
      banks we reviewed, the FDIC addressed problems that were initially not 
      related to capital. Our review showed that for institutions with safety 
      and soundness concerns identified as well capitalized or adequately 
      capitalized, PCA does not afford the FDIC with an immediate supervisory 
      remedy. PCA directives can be issued only after a problem institution’s 
      capital category crosses the undercapitalized threshold, which our 
      analysis has shown trails the first identification of significant safety 
      and soundness issues. However, the FDIC initiated other supervisory 
      actions to address various problems prior to a bank’s becoming 
      undercapitalized. In fact, the supervisory actions taken before PCA 
      directives were issued also included some of the capital-related 
      provisions in section 38.</P>
      <P>As discussed in the next section of our report, capital is a lagging 
      indicator, and the institutions in our sample of banks first exhibited 
      problems unrelated to their capital. However, the FDIC and the states 
      addressed these problems through the use of other available supervisory 
      actions before issuing PCA directives such as Board Resolutions, 
      Memorandums of Understanding (MOU), Cease and Desist Orders (C&amp;D), 
      State Commitment Letters, and written agreements. PCA directives were 
      issued for 8 of the 11 banks in our sample. The CAMELS ratings provide a 
      clear indication of the breadth of the problems these banks were 
      experiencing before their capital conditions deteriorated to the point 
      where PCA directives were issued. Examples of the problems follow:</P>
      <UL>
        <LI>Deficiencies related to management and Board of Directors oversight. 

        <LI>Lack of adequate internal control processes and procedures. 
        <LI>Lack of or inadequate written loan policies and procedures. 
        <LI>Unsound lending practices. 
        <LI>Inadequate provisions for Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses. 
        (Note: The Interagency Policy Statement on Allowances for Loan and Lease 
        Losses (ALLL) Methodologies and Documentation for Banks and Savings 
        Associations, dated July 25, 2001, clarifies that the board of directors 
        of each institution is responsible for ensuring that controls are in 
        place to determine the appropriate level of ALLL.) 
        <LI>Violations of laws and regulations. </LI></UL>

      <P>Source: OIG analysis of institutions in which PCA directives were 
      used.</P>
      <P>The supervisory actions taken in advance of PCA directives included 
      capital-related provisions similar to those that are mandated under 
      section 38, demonstrating the flexibility of these supervisory tools as 
      well as the regulators’ awareness of the developing problems related to 
      capital conditions. Supervisory actions, both MOUs and C&amp;Ds, contained 
      section 38-type provisions for seven of eight banks listed in Table 3 for 
      which the FDIC used the PCA directives. Specific capital-related 
      provisions in supervisory actions taken prior to PCA directives 
follow:</P>
      <UL>
        <LI>Maintenance of Tier 1 capital at or above the threshold for the 
        “well capitalized” category. 
        <LI>Requirements to submit capital plans and abide by any conditions 
        stipulated within the plans. 
        <LI>Prohibitions against declaring dividends without the FDIC’s consent.

      <P><B>Contents of Text Box:</B> While sections 38 and 39 are a valuable 
      part of DSC’s financial institution supervision/enforcement processes, 
      similar, if not the same results can be achieved through the use of 
      various provisions of section 8 of the FDI Act. Relevant provisions 
      include the termination of insurance, cease and desist actions, temporary 
      cease and desist actions, and suspension and removal actions. Because of 
      the broader scope of corrective actions achieved by use of section 8(b), 
      DSC more commonly utilizes section 8(b) in addressing problem institution 
      situations. Section 8(b) orders typically include provisions covering the 
      various requirements and limitations of section 38, even when the subject 
      institution would not otherwise be subject to the PCA enforcement 
      framework. </P>
      <P>Source: FDIC Division of Supervision and Consumer Protection<BR>(Note:

      <P><B>Contents of Text Box:</B> PCA is most effective in the circumstances 
      in which an institution is already within a capital category that allows 
      for the issuance of a PCA directive and where the problems to be addressed 
      are essentially capital driven. When the institution’s problems include 
      other issues, such as the need to cease violations or correct unsafe or 
      unsound practices or for affirmative relief, other enforcement 
      remedies--cease and desist orders, for example--are more appropriate. 
      Experience has been that while PCA should be “prompt,” it is often as 
      quick to get a cease and desist or other order by consent in as little 
      time, with broader relief. In addition, the FDIC is not constrained by the 
      requirements of PCA regarding capital levels when pursuing cease and 
      desist actions.</P>

      <P><B>FACTORS IMPACTING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SECTION 38 CAPITAL-RELATED 
      PROVISIONS</B></P>
      <P>During our review, we observed that a number of factors impact the 
      effectiveness of PCA provisions. The foundation of section 38 is capital, 
      which can be a lagging indicator of an institution’s operational and 
      financial problems. In addition, use of PCA directives depends on the 
      accuracy of capital ratios reported in Call Reports. However, we noted 
      that capital ratios reported in Call Reports are not always reliable. 
      Further, institutions increased their capital before or after issuance of 
      PCA directives. Finally, risks related to subprime loans are not accounted 
      for in the current method of computing capital. All of these factors delay 
      the use of PCA directives. </P>
      <P><B>Capital Can Be a Lagging Indicator</B></P>
      <P>Section 38 has an inherent limitation because the foundation for its 
      provisions is capital, which can be a lagging indicator of an 
      institution’s operational and financial health. Traditionally, capital has 
      been a focus of regulatory oversight because it provides an important 
      cushion to absorb an institution’s losses. Although capital is an 
      objective measure of financial health, it may not show signs of decline 
      until a bank has experienced substantial deterioration in its operations. 
      Problems related to an institution’s asset quality, management, and 
      internal controls can occur years before capital is adversely affected. As 
      we discussed earlier, capital is the centerpiece of section 38 provisions, 
      and the actions provided for under that section are tied to declining 
      capital levels.</P>
      <P>Our review of the eight institutions for which the FDIC issued PCA 
      directives showed that, in all cases, one or more examinations revealed 
      deteriorating conditions in various aspects of bank operations before 
      capital began to deteriorate. Because the problems identified were 
      initially unrelated to capital, the FDIC took other supervisory actions to 
      address those problems. For purposes of our analysis, we defined the onset 
      of problems in an institution when the bank’s CAMELS composite rating was 
      first determined to be a 3, 4, or 5. Seven of the eight banks were 
      considered to be well capitalized when they were initially assigned 
      composite ratings of 3 or worse. Consequently, there is usually a time lag 
      between the initial identification of a bank’s problems and issuance of 
      PCA directives. Table 4 shows the eight institutions and the problems 
      identified by examiners, their capital category at the time problems were 
      identified, whether other supervisory actions were taken prior to PCA, and 
      the time between the initial identification of problems and subsequent 
      issuance of PCA directives.</P>

      <P>Source: OIG analysis of institutions in which the FDIC issued a PCA 
      directive.</P>
      <P>In reviewing the eight banks for which PCA directives were used, we 
      observed that in all cases, the examiners identified deteriorating asset 
      quality, which resulted from deficiencies related to bank management 
      and/or board oversight. Examiners identified the following examples of 
      deficiencies related to deteriorating asset quality:</P>
      <UL>
        <LI>problems related to one person dominating the institution, 
        <LI>weak or inadequate board oversight, 
        <LI>insider lending or related abuses, and 
        <LI>lack of expertise and/or qualified personnel. </LI></UL>
      <P>Although Open Banks # 1 and # 3 were not subject to PCA directives, 
      their component ratings for capital were 3 and 5, respectively (see Tables 
      7 and 6). Although examiners also identified problems related to 
      management and/or board oversight for these two banks, the problems were 
      due to the control exercised by their holding companies. These types of 
      deficiencies, with specific examples taken from our case studies, are 
      discussed in Appendix IV of the report.</P>
      <P><B>Capital Ratios Reported in Call Reports Are Not Always 
      Reliable</B></P>
      <P>The capital ratios reported by institutions in their Call Reports did 
      not always reflect actual financial conditions. Specifically, for 9 of the 
      11 banks that we reviewed, we observed that during examinations, the FDIC 
      lowered the capital categories reported by the banks in Call Reports by 
      one or more levels. In addition, two earlier reports that we issued 
      pointed out problems with the valuation of assets and the delay in 
      determining the fair value of assets and the appropriate capital category 
      for implementing PCA provisions. (Note: FDIC OIG Audit Report No. 02-013, 
      <I>The Effectiveness of Prompt Corrective Action Provisions in Preventing 
      or Reducing Losses to the Deposit Insurance Funds</I>, dated March 26, 
      2002, and Audit Report No. 03-017, <I>Material Loss Review of the Failure 
      of the Connecticut Bank of Commerce, Stamford, Connecticut</I>, dated 
      March 10, 2003.) The institutions report their capital ratios every 3 
      months in their Call Reports. However, apart from some edits and 
      validation checks, the FDIC verifies the accuracy of the information 
      submitted in Call Reports only during examinations.</P>
      <P>Consequently, depending on whether an institution’s examination cycle 
      is 12 or 18 months, erroneous or intentionally misleading financial 
      information may go undetected by the regulators for a period of a year or 
      more. During the time between examinations, an institution that is 
      experiencing worsening financial or operational problems may be successful 
      in forestalling capital-driven regulatory actions by submitting overly 
      optimistic or inaccurate information, thereby postponing the initiation of 
      PCA directives.</P>
      <P>The FDIC verifies the accuracy of information reported by institutions 
      during examinations or special visitations. Under Section 7 of the FDI 
      Act, codified to 12 U.S.C. §1817, FDIC-supervised institutions submit 
      quarterly Call Reports to the FDIC. The accuracy of a bank’s capital 
      ratios is based on the fair value of its assets, an assessment of the 
      risks in a bank’s portfolio as judged by its managers, and the adequacy of 
      a bank’s ALLL. During the past few years, there have been repeated 
      instances where troubled institutions did not fully disclose their true 
      financial condition in Call Report information. The consequences of these 
      situations have been large losses to the insurance funds.</P>
      <UL>
        <LI>We concluded in our March 2002 report on the effectiveness of PCA 
        that, in the cases of Superior Bank, First National Bank of Keystone, 
        and Pacific Thrift &amp; Loan Company, PCA provisions had not been 
        implemented in a timely manner. All three institutions had a high 
        concentration of residual assets and either valued those assets using 
        optimistic assumptions and/or failed to discount future cash flows that 
        inflated the institutions’ income and capital. Therefore, the capital 
        levels for those three institutions were above the minimum levels 
        required by the regulators to invoke section 38 actions because a fair 
        value of the residuals had not been determined. (Note: FDIC OIG Audit 
        Report No. 02-013, entitled <I>The Effectiveness of Prompt Corrective 
        Action Provisions in Preventing or Reducing Losses to the Deposit 
        Insurance Funds</I>, dated March 26, 2002. On November 29, 2001, federal 
        regulators issued Financial Institution Letter 99-01 entitled “Final 
        Rule to Amend the Regulatory Capital Treatment of Recourse Arrangements, 
        Direct Credit Substitutes, Residual Interests in Asset Securitizations, 
        and Asset Backed and Mortgage-Backed Securities,” which addressed the 
        capital requirements for residual assets.)<BR><BR>
        <LI>Our review of the failure of the Connecticut Bank of Commerce (CBC) 
        showed that in December 1996, the bank’s capital category reached an 
        acceptable position of “adequately capitalized” and remained in this 
        category until 1999, when it became “well-capitalized.” Because CBC 
        masked the true nature of certain financial transactions, examiners did 
        not determine its actual financial condition until a full investigation 
        was performed subsequent to the March 2001 examination. Once the bank’s 
        loan schemes were uncovered, the examiners concluded that CBC was 
        critically undercapitalized, and it was closed on June 26, 2002. (Note: 
        FDIC OIG Audit Report No. 03-017, entitled <I>Material Loss Review of 
        the Failure of the Connecticut Bank of Commerce, Stamford, 
        Connecticut</I>, dated March 10, 2003.) </LI></UL>
      <P>In addition, for 9 of the 11 banks reviewed, we noted instances where 
      the capital categories reported by the banks in their Call Reports 
      overstated the banks’ actual capital conditions. This observation is based 
      on our comparison of capital ratios reported by the banks in their Call 
      Reports with ratios developed by examiners during examinations for 
      corresponding periods. Table 5 shows the 9 institutions for which 
      examiners lowered the capital category.</P>

      <P>Source: OIG Analysis of 11 institutions in our sample.</P>
      <P>We noted that for the Bank of Sierra Blanca and Home State Bank, 
      examiners lowered each bank’s capital category on three occasions. The 
      Bank of Honolulu had its capital category reduced twice, and the remaining 
      six banks had their categories lowered once. Most (about 71 percent) of 
      the downward revisions in capital categories in our sample involved 
      lowering a bank’s category two or more levels. Notably, the capital 
      categories for the Bank of Alamo, Bank of Falkner, and Salt Lick Bank were 
      reduced to the maximum extent possible, four levels – from 
      “well-capitalized” to “critically undercapitalized.”</P>
      <P><B>Institutions May Delay Implementation of PCA Directives or Closure 
      by Increasing Capital</B></P>
      <P>During our review, we determined that several institutions increased 
      their capital before or after issuance of PCA directives, thereby delaying 
      implementation of the directives or, in some cases, closure. Institutions 
      or their holding companies used various ways to increase capital, 
      including selling assets, transferring income from another affiliate, 
      contributing in-kind capital, and injecting capital in cash. These forms 
      of capital infusion are accepted industry practices, and additional 
      capital strengthens the financial condition of institutions. The 
      infusions, nevertheless, can delay the initiation of PCA directives or 
      raise capital levels above capital thresholds, causing PCA directives to 
      be withdrawn without correcting the underlying problems at the 
      institutions.</P>
      <P><B>Sale of Assets:</B> The Bank of Honolulu serves as an example of an 
      institution in our sample that sold assets to increase its capital ratios 
      before PCA directives were issued. The bank had not achieved a CAMELS 
      composite rating better than a “3” since its September 30, 1991 joint 
      examination. In two examinations and a visitation occurring between 
      January 1999 and January 2000, examiners noted that the Bank of Honolulu 
      maintained its capital through asset shrinkage. In other words, the bank 
      sold assets to increase its capital. This bank’s capital category was 
      adequately capitalized during the January 1999 examination, the following 
      visit in June 1999, and an examination in January 2000. The FDIC issued a 
      PCA directive in August 2000 when the FDIC determined the bank’s capital 
      level to be “significantly undercapitalized.”</P>
      <P><B>Transfer of Income from Affiliate:</B> In Open Bank # 1, one of the 
      three open banks in our sample, the examiners noted that the bank 
      benefited from a transfer of income from an affiliate owned by the 
      institution’s parent. In fact, the examination report stated:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>High earnings are, in part, due to transfer of income from 
        affiliates. For example, [Open Bank # 1] received $73 million in 
        mortgage servicing income in 1999. However, this bank does not perform 
        any servicing and has minimal involvement in the programs. ... This 
        example illustrates that earnings of the bank are dependent on the 
        parent’s policy for allocating earnings among subsidiaries. Currently, 
        [Open Bank # 1] is the beneficiary of the parent’s policy. </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Even after the transfer of such a substantial amount, Open Bank # 1 
      reported a net income of just $48.6 million for 1999. Additionally, 
      examiners determined that net income was overstated by approximately $12.5 
      million because of (1) inappropriate recognition of $4 million in income, 
      (2) failure to recognize $4 million in operating losses, and (3) 
      underfunding of the ALLL by approximately $4.5 million. </P>
      <P>Assuming that the $73 million transfer of income was not made, the 
      institution would have incurred a net loss of $36.9 million, computed as 
      follows:</P>
      <P>Reported net income of $48.6 million<BR>Less: <BR>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>Operating losses not recognized of (4.0 million), <BR>Income 
        inappropriately recognized of (4.0 million), and <BR>Underfunded ALLL of 
        (4.5 million) </BLOCKQUOTE>Equals: Net income before adjustment for 
      transfer of income from affiliate of 36.1 million<BR>Less: Transfer of 
      income from affiliate of (73.0 million)<BR>Equals: a Net Loss of ($36.9 
      million) 
      <P></P>
      <P>This example illustrates how a parent company radically changed the 
      financial results of its subsidiary institution from a loss of $36.9 
      million in 1 year to a net income of $48.6 million, through a transfer of 
      income from an affiliate. In addition, the parent contributed capital 
      in-kind, discussed below, which further increased the institution’s 
      capital. Without the transfer of income and contribution of in-kind 
      capital, it is likely that this institution would have been subject to a 
      PCA directive.</P>
      <P><B>Contents of Text Box:</B> This affiliate transaction was considered 
      a form of parent company support for the financial institution. Had the 
      income from the affiliate not transferred, it would have required another 
      form of parent company support to support growth, such as a direct capital 
      injection. </P>
      <P>DSC further clarified that the bank included the transferred income in 
      its reported income in the Call Report. This transfer should not have been 
      reported as income on the Call Report. The FDIC has long taken the 
      position that income transfers by a holding company to a bank should be 
      reported as capital contributions. Banks should not report report in its 
      income any income that arose from assets owned by an affiliate (other than 
      its own subsidiary) or was otherwise generated by an affiliate that its 
      parent company transfers to it. Otherwise, the parent company could 
      conceivably make the bank’s earnings be any number the parent wanted it to 
      be. </P>
      <P>Source: FDIC Division of Supervision and Consumer Protection<BR>(Note: 
      End of Text Box.)</P>
      <P><B>In-Kind Capital Contribution: </B>Open Bank # 1 was also the 
      beneficiary of an in-kind capital contribution made by its parent. During 
      1999, this bank’s capital level was less than satisfactory. In response, 
      Open Bank # 1’s parent made an in-kind contribution from two of its 
      subsidiaries into the bank, representing a contribution of $41.5 million. 
      This amount included $38.2 million in assets from one of the parent’s 
      subsidiaries and consisted of a Class C retained interest on credit card 
      securitizations. The assets were contributed at book value without an 
      independent market value appraisal. The remaining $3.3 million consisted 
      of computer software and office equipment owned by another subsidiary of 
      the parent, which was also contributed without an independent market value 
      appraisal. This subsidiary continued to use these assets without 
      reimbursing the bank. </P>
      <P>These examples of transfers from affiliates clearly illustrate how a 
      parent holding company can manipulate the net income and capital levels of 
      a bank to prevent or delay the implementation of PCA directives.</P>
      <P><B>Contents of Text Box:</B> This affiliate transaction was considered 
      a form of parent company support for the financial institution. Had the 
      in-kind contribution not been made, it would have required another form of 
      parent company support to support growth, such as a direct capital 
      injection. </P>
      <P>Source: FDIC Division of Supervision and Consumer Protection<BR>(Note: 
      End of Text Box.)</P>
      <P><B>Contribution of Capital After a PCA Directive:</B> Based on a review 
      of the Bank of Sierra Blanca’s June 30, 2000 Call Report, the FDIC 
      determined the bank to be significantly undercapitalized. The FDIC issued 
      a PCA directive to the bank in August 2000. The bank’s directors then made 
      three capital injections between October 2000 and June 2001. Initially, 
      the directors made a capital injection of $514,000 in October 2000. The 
      directors injected an additional $301,000 in November 2000. These two 
      capital injections improved the bank’s capital position, and the bank 
      reported itself well capitalized as of December 31, 2000.</P>
      <P>In April 2001, the state conducted an examination and again determined 
      the bank’s capital level to be undercapitalized. In June 2001, the 
      directors injected an additional $100,000 of capital, and the bank became 
      adequately capitalized. However, anticipated loan loss recoveries did not 
      materialize for the bank, and in November 2001, the FDIC notified the 
      bank’s board that the bank was critically undercapitalized. On January 17, 
      2002, the FDIC and the state met with the board and directed an injection 
      of $1.5 million in new capital, which the board was unable to meet. The 
      state closed the bank the next day. </P>
      <P><B>Contents of Text Box:</B> Capital contributions (either directly or 
      indirectly through the transfer of income from an affiliate) are almost 
      always good for the FDIC—even if the institution ultimately fails. Capital 
      contributions increase the probability that the institution will survive 
      and reduce FDIC losses in the event of failure. </P>
      <P>Source: FDIC Division of Supervision and Consumer Protection<BR>(Note: 
      End of Text Box.)</P>
      <P>We agree that capital contributions will almost always serve to protect 
      the insurance funds. However, such contributions in the form of sales of 
      assets or in-kind capital contributions without independent valuations may 
      not always serve to prevent or reduce losses to the insurance funds. For 
      example, an institution may sell its quality income producing assets to 
      bring in additional capital, thus delaying the use of PCA directives 
      and/or closure. Also, with in-kind contributions, the quality of the 
      contributions may be suspect if bank management does not independently 
      value these assets. In both cases, the transactions delay closure, and 
      remaining assets may deteriorate further, resulting in additional losses 
      to the insurance funds. </P>
      <P><B>Risks Related to Subprime Loans Are Not Accounted for in the Current 
      Method of Computing Capital </B></P>
      <P>The current method of computing capital does not take into account 
      risks related to subprime loans. Specifically, the federal banking 
      regulators currently do not require institutions in their Call Reports to 
      risk-weight subprime loans commensurate with the risks associated with 
      those loans. Consequently, the capital ratios reported in Call Reports for 
      those institutions may be inflated, thus delaying the initiation of PCA 
      directives in banks that are experiencing problems.</P>
      <P>The FDIC collects, corrects, updates, and stores Call Reports submitted 
      by institutions it supervises on a quarterly basis. Call Reports are a 
      widely used source of financial data regarding a bank's condition and the 
      results of its operations. Under the banking agencies’ risk-based capital 
      guidelines, assets and credit equivalent amounts of derivatives and 
      off-balance sheet items are assigned to one of several broad risk 
      categories according to obligor, or, if relevant, the guarantor or the 
      nature of the collateral. The resulting weighted values from each of the 
      risk categories are added together, and this sum is the bank’s total 
      risk-weighted assets, which comprises the denominator of the risk-based 
      capital ratio. The risk-weights associated with each asset are included in 
      Schedule RC-R – Regulatory Capital, which is part of the Call Report. </P>
      <P>All three open institutions in our sample had subprime loans in their 
      portfolio. As early as 1997, regulators were cautioning financial 
      institutions regarding the potential risk associated with subprime 
      lending. However, there are no federal laws, regulations, or rules 
      concerning subprime lending. In March 1999, the Federal Financial 
      Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) issued the <I>Interagency 
      Guidelines on Subprime Lending</I>. (Note: The FFIEC was established by 
      the Congress to promote improved and consistent examination and 
      supervision policies and procedures among the five financial institution 
      regulatory agencies. The FFIEC includes representatives of the FDIC, FRB, 
      OCC, OTS, and National Credit Union Administration (NCUA).) The guidelines 
      defined subprime lending as “extending credit to borrowers who exhibit 
      characteristics indicating a significantly higher risk of default than 
      traditional bank lending customers” and required regulators to evaluate 
      the capital levels at examinations of banks engaged in subprime lending. 
      (Note: The FDI Act, Section 10(d), requires the appropriate federal 
      banking agency to conduct annual full-scope, on-site examinations of each 
      insured depository institution.) In January 2001, the FFIEC issued 
      <I>Expanded Guidance for Evaluating Subprime Lending Programs</I> 
      (Expanded Guidance). This Expanded Guidance supplements the FFIEC 
      guidelines issued in March 1999 and is specifically tailored to 
      institutions that have subprime lending programs with an aggregate 
      exposure greater than or equal to 25 percent of Tier 1 Capital. The 
      Expanded Guidance states that because subprime lending poses more risk 
      than standard lending, it is expected that capital levels would be at 
      minimum one and a half to three times greater than what is appropriate for 
      non-subprime assets of a similar type. (Note: Potential long-term risks 
      are protected against through higher capital requirements. ALLL absorb 
      credit losses, in the short term, over the current operating cycle, 
      typically 12 months in accordance with the Interagency Policy Statement on 
      the ALLL, dated December 21, 1993.) </P>
      <P>Because of concerns relating to risks posed by subprime loans, and in 
      an attempt to identify additional sources of information related to 
      subprime lending programs at FDIC-insured institutions, the regulators 
      proposed changes to the Call Report. On May 31, 2000, the federal banking 
      agencies published a notice for comment regarding the inclusion of 
      additional reporting items in the Call Report for subprime lending 
      activities. However, on December 9, 2002, the FFIEC voted to drop the 
      proposal due to responses from the industry and Congress. In making the 
      decision to drop the proposal, the agencies agreed with commenters that 
      the industry lacks standard definitions for the terms “subprime” and 
      “program.” Thus, rather than impose an additional burden on institutions 
      through the proposed regulatory reporting requirement, the agencies 
      concluded that the examination process should continue to be the focal 
      point for supervising the subprime lending activities of banks and savings 
      associations. Consequently, under the current method of reporting, 
      institutions do not risk-weight subprime loans in their Call Reports as 
      suggested by the Expanded Guidance, resulting in inflated capital ratios 
      that may delay initiation of a PCA directive.</P>
      <P>Because the FFIEC decided not to require banks to use the higher risk 
      weighting for subprime loans in Call Reports and compliance with the 
      Expanded Guidance is voluntary, the FDIC cannot enforce the risk-weighting 
      of subprime loans during examinations. As a result, we observed a wide 
      disparity between capital adequacy as reported in the Call Reports and 
      examiners’ CAMELS ratings. We also observed that examination reports 
      generally criticize institutions for non-compliance with the Expanded 
      Guidance and inadequate capital in relation to the risks associated with 
      subprime loans. </P>
      <P>Since the issuance of the Expanded Guidance in January 2001, examiners 
      conducted two examinations in Open Banks # 3 and # 1--banks that had 
      subprime loans in their portfolios. Information and comments from 
      examination reports are provided below:</P>

      for PCA purposes was “adequately capitalized” and “well capitalized”

      that the institution had not implemented the Expanded Guidance and that 
      capital levels were inadequate under the Expanded Guidance. The second

      <P>Source: OIG analysis of examination reports of Open Bank #1.</P>
      <P>The first examination report stated that although the bank was 
      considered “well capitalized” for PCA purposes, the above-average risk in 
      loan and lease portfolios demonstrated the need for higher capital. The 
      report also stated that the institution had not followed the Expanded 
      Guidance. The second examination report stated that the capital was 
      marginally deficient to support the overall risk profile of the 
      institution and that the institution did not comply with the FFIEC 
      Expanded Guidance.</P>
      <P>While the FDIC criticized Open Banks #3 and #1 for their capital 
      inadequacy and non-compliance with the Expanded Guidance, it chose to 
      enforce only the higher capital provisions included in the Expanded 
      Guidance in Open Bank #2. The FDIC examined this bank in November 2001 and 
      determined that it was “undercapitalized” as of September 30, 2001, 
      although the bank was “well capitalized” as reported in the Call Report. 
      As of that date, the total assets and deposits were $1.92 billion and 
      $1.42 billion, respectively. The CAMELS rating assigned during this 
      examination was 4/454442. Subsequently, in May 2002, the FDIC issued and 
      the bank consented to a Cease and Desist order that included the following 
      provision:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>Submission of a capital plan to achieve/maintain an 8 
        percent Total Risk-based capital ratio based on 300 percent 
        risk-weighting of loans, by September 30, 2002 and a 10 percent Total 
        Risk-based capital ratio by March 31, 2003. </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>By including this provision in the Cease and Desist Order, the FDIC 
      effectively made the higher risk-weighting for subprime loans a formal 
      requirement although use of risk weighting is only a guideline for the 
      institutions and the examiners. It is not clear, however, why this same 
      strategy was not used in the other two open institutions. </P>
      <P>The three open banks in our sample show the wide disparity between 
      capital levels reported by banks in their Call Reports and by examiners in 
      CAMELS ratings or examination comments on capital adequacy. In addition, 
      the three banks show an apparent inconsistency in how DSC officials 
      applied the risk-weighting provision of the Expanded Guidance at these 
      three institutions. Although we reviewed only 3 open institutions with 
      subprime assets, as of December 31, 2002, 125 FDIC-insured institutions 
      had $53.8 billion in subprime assets. The magnitude of the number of 
      institutions and total value of subprime assets points to the need to 
      better monitor the capital adequacy reported in Call Reports and to 
      consistently apply the provision in the Expanded Guidance during 
      examinations. However, as long as the provision for higher risk weighting 
      for subprime loans is not a requirement and is not reported in the Call 
      Reports, identification of capital inadequacy may be difficult to achieve 
      between examinations or during examinations. </P>
      <P><B>Contents of Text Box:</B> In the Financial Institution Letter 
      (99-01) sent to institutions entitled “Final Rule to Amend the Regulatory 
      Capital Treatment of Recourse Arrangements, Direct Credit Substitutes, 
      Residual Interests in Asset Securitizations, and Asset-Backed and 
      Mortgage-Backed Securities” dated November 29, 2001, federal banking 
      regulators changed the regulatory capital standards to address the 
      treatment of the above-mentioned instruments, and provided each regulatory 
      agency with the reservation of authority to modify a stated risk-weight or 
      credit-conversion factor on a case-by-case basis. The effective date of 
      this final rule was January 1, 2002, but under certain circumstances, 
      implementation could be delayed to December 31, 2002. Under the new rule, 
      the Director of the Division of Supervision and Consumer Protection may, 
      on a case-by-case basis, determine the appropriate risk weight for any 
      asset or credit equivalent amount that does not fit wholly within one of 
      the risk categories set forth in Appendix A of Part 325 of the FDIC 
      Regulations, or that imposes risks on a bank that are not commensurate 
      with the risk weight otherwise specified in Appendix A for the asset or 
      credit equivalent amount. </P>
      <P>The Legal Division has opined that such a determination should not be 
      made prior to the December 31, 2002, final implementation date of the 
      rule. Consequently, while higher risk weights were used in the C&amp;D of 
      Open Bank # 2 and in the examination evaluation of capital adequacy, no 
      higher risk weights were used for PCA calculations. </P>
      <P>Source: DSCFDIC Division of Supervision and Consumer 
      Protection<BR>(Note: End of Text Box.)</P>
      <P>With regard to DSC’s comments above, under Financial Institution Letter 
      99-01, the Director of DSC can determine on a case-by-case basis the risk 
      weights of assets that do not fit wholly within one of the risk categories 
      set forth in Appendix A of Part 325 of the FDIC Regulations, codified to 
      12 C.F.R. part 325. However, application of this provision on a 
      case-by-case basis may result in inconsistent application of this rule as 
      was demonstrated with regard to Open Bank # 2 and the other two open 
      banks. Further, an important benefit of the Call Report, which is early 
      detection of capital adequacy problems between examinations, is not 
      achieved if the institutions are not required to report subprime loans on 
      a risk-weighted basis as suggested in the Expanded Guidance. </P>
      <P><B>Conclusion </B></P>
      <P>In 1991, Congress enacted FDICIA, in part, because of concerns that the 
      exercise of regulatory discretion during the 1980s did not adequately 
      protect the safety and soundness of the banking system or minimize 
      insurance fund losses. Section 38 and 39 provisions were originally 
      enacted to limit regulatory discretion in key areas and to mandate 
      regulatory responses against financial institutions with safety and 
      soundness problems. With respect to the the capital-related provisions of 
      section 38, our review of 11 FDIC-supervised institutions disclosed that 
      PCA directives were part of the enforcement process and prevented or 
      reduced losses to the deposit insurance funds. </P>
      <P>Our audit results point to several factors that can limit the 
      effectiveness of section 38 capital-related provisions– capital being a 
      lagging indicator, unreliable Call Report data, transactions that increase 
      capital before or after PCA directives are issued, and the inadequate 
      accounting for risk associated with subprime loans. With respect to 
      capital being a lagging indicator, we propose several options later in 
      this report to strengthen the non-capital related provisions of PCA to 
      mitigate this inherent weakness in PCA. Regarding unreliable Call Report 
      data, the limitations of such data have been well documented and, to date, 
      a solution outside of examiners reviewing the data against their 
      examination results has not emerged, which emphasizes the critical need 
      for timely and periodic on-site examinations. Also, capital infusions that 
      occur before and after PCA directives are issued are to be expected, and 
      we can only offer that the source of those infusions must be analyzed 
      carefully to ensure the transactions actually improve rather than mask the 
      health of the institution. Analyzing capital infusions will help prevent 
      undue forbearance by regulators. Finally, inadequate accounting for risk 
      associated with subprime loans in Call Reports can be mitigated through 
      revised reporting requirements. Such additional information would improve 
      the FDIC’s ability to detect capital deficiencies. </P>
      <H4>SECTION 38 AND 39 NON-CAPITAL-RELATED PROVISIONS</H4>
      <P><B>NON-CAPITAL-RELATED PROVISIONS WERE SELDOM USED</B></P>
      <P>From our review of 11 institutions, we observed that the FDIC seldom 
      used the non-capital provisions of PCA. Although the primary focus of 
      section 38 is capital, sections 38 and 39 provide for certain actions 
      based on non-capital factors to facilitate issuance of PCA directives or 
      to address a non-capital problem. Specifically, section 38(g) provides for 
      reclassification of the capital category of institutions based on 
      non-capital factors. Also, section 38(f)(2)(F) provides for regulatory 
      agencies to require an institution to improve management when regulators 
      consider management to be deficient. Finally, section 39 provides for 
      regulators to require a compliance plan from institutions when they 
      identify problems with (1) operations and management; (2) asset quality, 
      earnings, and stock valuation; and (3) compensation. </P>
      <P><B>Reclassification of Capital Category Based on Non-capital 
      Factors</B></P>
      <P>The FDIC did not use section 38(g) in any of the 11 institutions that 
      we reviewed even though opportunities were present at 10 institutions to 
      implement this provision. The remaining institution was closed immediately 
      without a PCA directive after a fraud scheme was discovered. Section 38(g) 
      provides regulators a means to take prompt corrective action based on 
      criteria other than capital. Specifically, the regulators can downgrade an 
      institution by one capital level if an institution is in an unsafe and 
      unsound condition or is engaged in unsafe and unsound practices. For 
      example, the regulators could downgrade an adequately capitalized 
      institution to the undercapitalized category and require the institution 
      to comply with the restrictions applicable to that category, such as 
      limits on the institution’s growth. However, the implementing regulation 
      for section 38(g) is vague and does not provide a clear trigger for 
      implementing this provision. In addition, this provision and the 
      implementing regulation place additional restrictions on use of the 
      provision.</P>
      <P>The implementing regulation for section 38(g) is contained in section 
      325.103 of the FDIC Regulations, codified to 12 C.F.R. 325.103. This 
      section states:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE><I>Reclassifications based on supervisory criteria other 
        than capital.</I> The FDIC may reclassify a well capitalized bank as 
        adequately capitalized and may require an adequately capitalized bank or 
        an undercapitalized bank to comply with certain mandatory or 
        discretionary supervisory actions as if the bank were in the next lower 
        capital category (except that the FDIC may not reclassify a 
        significantly undercapitalized bank as critically undercapitalized) 
        (each of these actions are hereinafter referred to generally as 
        "reclassifications") in the following circumstances: <BR>(1) <I>Unsafe 
        or unsound condition.</I> The FDIC has determined, after notice and 
        opportunity for hearing pursuant to § 308.202(a) of this chapter, that 
        the bank is in unsafe or unsound condition; or <BR>(2) <I>Unsafe or 
        unsound practice.</I> The FDIC has determined, after notice and 
        opportunity for hearing pursuant to § 308.202(a) of this chapter, that, 
        in the most recent examination of the bank, the bank received and has 
        not corrected a less-than-satisfactory rating for any of the categories 
        of asset quality, management, earnings, or liquidity. </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>As can be seen, this section of the regulation provides for two 
      situations when an institution’s capital category can be reclassified. 
      However, both situations require judgment on the FDIC’s part before this 
      provision can be implemented. The first situation requires judgment as to 
      when the FDIC considers an institution to be in an unsafe and unsound 
      condition. Although the second situation provides an objective measure—the 
      CAMELS rating assigned during examinations—for the purpose of 
      reclassifying an institution to the next lower capital category, it is 
      still subjective in that this section does not define a 
      “less-than-satisfactory” rating. Consequently, section 38(g) does not 
      provide objective criteria for implementation and does not clearly state 
      when this provision can be used. Based on our review of 11 FDIC 
      institutions, using a composite rating of 4 or lower as the criteria, we 
      determined that the FDIC could have reclassified 10 of the 11 institutions 
      to the next lower capital category, but did not do so. </P>
      <P><B>Contents of Text Box:</B> Section 38(g) criteria for 
      “reclassification” includes that the appropriate banking agency may deem 
      the institution to be engaging in an unsafe and unsound banking practice, 
      a matter with which the banking agencies have significant experience. 
      Absent other available enforcement vehicles, the agencies would no doubt 
      utilize section 38(g) more often to “reclassify” troubled institutions. 
      However, enforcement authority under section 8(b) of the FDI Act is also 
      premised on unsafe and unsound banking practices. A major consideration 
      here is that mandatory actions triggered by non-capital criteria under an 
      enhanced PCA framework would likely be duplicative of those imposed 
      otherwise under a more comprehensive section 8 enforcement action.</P>
      <P>Source: FDIC Division of Supervision and Consumer Protection<BR>(Note: 
      End of Text Box.)</P>
      <P>In addition to not providing objective criteria, this provision also 
      imposes several restrictions on its implementation. For the FDIC to 
      implement this section, it is required to provide the institution with a 
      notice and an opportunity for hearing in accordance with section 
      308.202-<I>Procedures for reclassifying a bank based on criteria other 
      than capital</I> of the FDIC regulations, codified to 12 C.F.R. 325.202. A 
      review of this section of the regulation indicates that the FDIC is 
      required to provide prior notice to the institution, allow the institution 
      to file a written response to the notice, allow the institution to request 
      a hearing and present oral testimony or witness, order an informal 
      hearing, and designate a hearing officer. In addition, this section 
      describes hearing procedures and allows for a request for rescission of 
      reclassification by the institution when circumstances change. The lack of 
      objective criteria and these restrictions make the implementation of the 
      reclassification provision very difficult.</P>
      <P><B>Contents of Text Box:</B> To reclassify an institution, we must 
      determine, after a notice and hearing that an institution is in an unsafe 
      or unsound condition or is engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice under 
      section 8(b)(8)--which requires that an institution receive in its most 
      recent examination a less than satisfactory rating for asset quality, 
      management, earnings, or liquidity. If we meet that test, then the FDIC 
      issues a written notice of intent to reclassify. The bank may respond to 
      the notice within the time period set by the FDIC, which is 14 days 
      (unless the FDIC sets a shorter period). Failure to respond to a notice 
      within the specified time period constitutes a waiver of the right to 
      respond and consent to the reclassification. The bank may request an 
      informal hearing before designated FDIC officials to contest the proposed 
      reclassification. The FDIC will order the hearing to commence within 30 
      days or receipt of the request. The bank can introduce written testimony 
      and oral argument, although introduction of oral testimony and witnesses 
      is at the discretion of the hearing officer. Within 20 days of the hearing 
      and closing of the record, the presiding officer must make a 
      recommendation to the FDIC regarding reclassification. Within 60 days of 
      closing the record or, if there was no hearing, the date the response was 
      received, the FDIC has to make a decision on the reclassification. This 
      process saves little time and may require a substantial cost burden for 
      litigation, albeit informal litigation.</P>
      <P>An additional issue is what happens when an institution’s capital 
      category rises before the process of issuing a directive is complete, or 
      after the directive is issued. Banks can subsequently request that a 
      reclassification be rescinded and any directives issued in connection with 
      the reclassification be modified, rescinded, or removed upon a change in 
      circumstances.</P>
      <P>Thus the requirement that an institution be in a particular capital 
      category has at times been a problem. In instances in which an institution 
      is well capitalized or adequately capitalized, PCA does not provide a full 
      remedy. Getting an institution reclassified to a level that allows us to 
      take the action we need is often a difficult and lengthy process. In 
      addition, we only can obtain one level of downgrading through this 
      process.</P>

      <P><B>Improving Management</B></P>
      <P>During our review, we observed that for 2 of 11 institutions, the FDIC 
      issued a “Notice of Intent to Issue a Prompt Corrective Directive Ordering 
      Dismissal.” Although opportunities for similar actions were present in 
      four other institutions, the FDIC did not initiate this action. Section 
      38(f)(2)(F) provides that once an institution reaches the “significantly 
      undercapitalized” capital category, the regulators can initiate action to 
      improve management by requiring the board to take one of the following 
      actions:</P>
      <UL>
        <LI>Ordering a new election for the institution’s board of directors. 
        <LI>Requiring the dismissal of directors or senior executive officers. 
        <LI>Requiring the employment of qualified senior executive officers. 
        </LI></UL>
      <P>Of the eight failed or acquired institutions in our sample, six reached 
      the “significantly undercapitalized” capital category or worse. The FDIC 
      used the authority provided by section 38(f)(2)(F) in the following two 
      cases.</P>
      <UL>
        <LI>In the case of Victory State Bank, the examiners noted that the 
        bank’s condition was continuing to deteriorate as a result of the 
        Chairman’s detrimental influence. The examiners cited the main cause as 
        the Chairman’s excessive compensation. In addition, underwriting and 
        credit administration practices were weak. The FDIC issued a “Notice of 
        Intent to Issue a Prompt Corrective Directive Ordering Dismissal” of the 
        Chairman on March 5, 1999, and the bank was closed on March 26, 1999. 
        <BR><BR>
        <LI>In the case of Bank of Alamo, the problems started with the Chairman 
        of the Board, who had very little experience managing a bank. After 
        gaining control of the institution, he appointed unqualified or 
        inexperienced personnel to run the bank. Additionally, he entered into 
        personal business relationships that he did not divulge to the board or 
        to the examiners. Under his control, the bank extended a $4.23 million 
        line of credit (approximately 76 percent of Tier 1 capital) that was 
        broken into several smaller credits to conceal violations of state legal 
        lending limits. The bank also extended another poorly structured and 
        poorly documented $1.5 million credit to another borrower. When these 
        two loans, along with other loans, became delinquent, the bank’s capital 
        became deficient. The FDIC issued a “Notice of Intent to Issue a Prompt 
        Corrective Directive Ordering Dismissal” on October 18, 2002, and the 
        Chairman of the Board resigned on October 28, 2002. The bank was closed 
        on November 8, 2002. </LI></UL>
      <P>Four other institutions’ capital reached the “significantly 
      undercapitalized” level. In all four cases, the FDIC did not initiate 
      action under this section even though the banks’ management was considered 
      inadequate. For example, in the case of First Alliance Bank and Trust, the 
      bank reached the “significantly undercapitalized” capital category as of 
      June 30, 2000. Examiners noted that, in addition to lacking technical 
      expertise, management either failed to develop policies and procedures or 
      failed to follow those that were developed. Management and the board also 
      allowed the bank to deviate from its business plan, losses were higher 
      than projected because of poorly conceived business lines, no strategic 
      plan had been developed, and disagreements and dissention persisted 
      because of constant turnover on the board and within top management.</P>
      <P>The two banks—Victory State Bank and Bank of Alamo--for which the FDIC 
      used this provision, were closed within a month after the dismissal action 
      was taken. As we have demonstrated earlier, capital is a lagging 
      indicator, and capital can remain in the “well to adequate” range long 
      after deterioration has begun in a bank’s operations and/or finances. 
      Because section 38(f)(2) allows regulators to take actions to improve 
      management only after an institution reaches the “significantly 
      undercapitalized” category, by the time the actions are initiated, they 
      may have only marginal effect in improving management or the institution. 
      </P>
      <P><B>Contents of Text Box: </B>With regard to actions against 
      individuals, PCA has lesser standards than section 8(e) removal actions, 
      but the relief is not as broad. PCA dismisses an officer from his position 
      while section 8(e) removes any institution-affiliated party from the 
      banking industry. Again, an institution must fall within an appropriate 
      capital category in order for the FDIC to act.</P>

      <P><B>Supervisory Actions Based on Safety and Soundness Standards</B></P>
      <P>Section 39 directs regulatory attention to the non-capital areas of an 
      institution’s activities as they pertain to safety and soundness. To limit 
      deposit insurance losses caused by factors other than capital, section 39 
      directs each regulator to establish standards defining safety and 
      soundness in three overall areas: (1) operations and management; (2) asset 
      quality, earnings, and stock valuations; and (3) compensation. This 
      section also directs regulators to require a corrective action plan from 
      institutions that fail to meet any of the standards. The FDIC used section 
      39 in only 1—the Salt Lick Deposit Bank--of the 11 institutions that we 
      reviewed. For the other 10 institutions, the FDIC used other enforcement 
      actions, such as MOUs and C&amp;Ds, even though opportunities were present 
      in some institutions to implement section 39. Our review of the 
      legislative history of section 39 revealed that several provisions in the 
      original legislation were removed to provide discretion to the regulators 
      and, as a result, this section was weakened. In addition, this section 
      lacks objective criteria defining conditions that would trigger regulatory 
      action. The following example shows the FDIC’s use of section 39 in the 
      one institution in our sample.</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>The FDIC implemented section 39 in the case of the Salt Lick 
        Deposit Bank with little effect. This bank, with total assets of $47 
        million, had purchased 58 non-rated industrial development bonds (IDBs) 
        with a book value of $9.7 million. These bonds were essentially 
        commercial loans to under-capitalized corporate borrowers. These bonds 
        were not traded readily, so their fair market value was difficult to 
        ascertain. On November 28, 2000, the FDIC issued a notice under section 
        39 requiring a Safety and Soundness Compliance Plan to review all 
        non-rated assets contained in the investment portfolio and to make the 
        bank’s books reflect the market value of each non-rated security. 
        However, before the Safety and Soundness Compliance Plan was accepted, 
        the FDIC issued a C&amp;D on January 18, 2001, that included the same 
        requirements that were in the Safety and Soundness Compliance Plan. An 
        examination conducted in March 2001 classified approximately $4.5 
        million of the IDBs, causing the bank’s capital to drop to the 
        “critically undercapitalized” level. Salt Lick Deposit Bank was acquired 
        by another bank on May 9, 2001. </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>An analysis of the legislative history indicates that section 39 
      originally required banking regulators to prescribe safety and soundness 
      standards through regulations. For the operations and management 
      standards, section 39 had required the regulators to prescribe standards 
      on internal control, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit 
      underwriting, interest rate exposure, and asset growth. For asset quality, 
      earnings, and stock valuation, the section initially required regulators 
      to establish quantitative standards. For compensation standards, the 
      regulators were to specify when compensation, fees, or benefits to 
      executive officers, employees, and directors would be considered excessive 
      or could lead to material financial loss. In addition, another key 
      provision of the section directed regulators to require a corrective 
      action plan from institutions or holding companies that fail to meet any 
      of the standards. </P>
      <P>The Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994 
      (CDRI), Public Law 103-325, was passed on September 23, 1994, and 
      contained more than 50 provisions that were intended to reduce bank 
      regulatory burden and paperwork requirements. Among its provisions, CDRI 
      amended some of section 39’s requirements to provide regulators with 
      greater flexibility and to respond to concerns that section 39 would 
      subject depository institutions to undue “micromanagement” by the 
      regulators. The CDRI amendments allowed regulators to issue the standards 
      in the form of guidelines instead of regulations. If guidelines were used, 
      the amendments gave the regulators the discretion to decide whether a 
      corrective action plan would be required from institutions that were found 
      not to be in compliance with the standards. Finally, the amendments 
      eliminated the requirement that regulators issue quantitative standards 
      for asset quality and earnings, and excluded holding companies from the 
      scope of the standard. </P>
      <P>The CDRI did not change section 39’s original provision regarding the 
      content and review of any corrective action plan required as a result of 
      noncompliance with section 39’s safety and soundness standards. Thus, 
      regulators still were required to issue regulations governing the contents 
      of the plan, time frames for the submission and review of the plan, and 
      enforcement actions applicable to the failure to submit or implement a 
      required plan.</P>
      <P>The banking regulators had not used their section 39 enforcement 
      authority against an institution from inception of the section in December 
      1991 to September 1996. In July 1995, the regulators issued final 
      guidelines and regulations to implement parts of section 39. Specifically, 
      the regulators issued standards governing operations and management and 
      compensation. Regulators also issued requirements for the submission and 
      review of compliance plans. In August 1996, the regulators issued the 
      remaining standards required for the full implementation of section 
      39–asset quality and earnings.</P>
      <P>The safety and soundness standards contained in the guidelines are 
      general in nature and do not identify specific unsafe and unsound 
      conditions and practices. The standards consist of broad statements of 
      sound banking principles that are subject to considerable interpretation 
      by the regulators. For example, the standards for asset quality state that 
      “an insured depository institution should establish and maintain a system 
      that is commensurate with the institution's size and the nature and scope 
      of its operations to identify problem assets and prevent deterioration in 
      those assets.” Specifically, the guidelines require institutions to 
      conduct periodic reviews to identify problem assets, compare problem 
      assets to capital to establish reserves, take appropriate actions, etc. 
      Although these controls and processes are required as part of the 
      standards, these expectations do not provide measurable criteria of unsafe 
      and unsound conditions or practices that would trigger mandatory 
      actions.</P>
      <P>Further, the guidelines and regulations do not require regulators to 
      take corrective action against institutions that do not meet the standards 
      for safety and soundness. The CDRI amended the section 39 mandate that 
      regulators require an institution to file a corrective action plan if the 
      institution is found not to be in compliance with the standards. The new 
      provision allows regulators greater flexibility in deciding when or 
      whether to impose this requirement. Although requiring a corrective action 
      is within the discretion of the regulators, the guidelines do not provide 
      quantifiable criteria or specific guidance for measuring an institution’s 
      compliance with section 39 standards or triggering actions under this 
      section. </P>
      <P>Although the original intent of section 39 was to limit the deposit 
      insurance losses caused by factors other than capital, subsequent 
      amendments and the discretion provided to regulators substantially 
      weakened this section. In addition, the lack of objective criteria for 
      triggering action and the lack of quantifiable criteria or specific 
      guidance for measuring an institution’s compliance with section 39 
      standards make this section difficult to implement.</P>
      <P><B>Contents of Text Box: </B>Section 39 is designed to prompt a bank to 
      take steps to identify problems before its safety and soundness becomes 
      impaired. The process involved allows the FDIC to request that a bank file 
      a compliance plan indicating the steps it will take to correct noted 
      deficiencies. The bank is generally given 30 days to file an acceptable 
      compliance plan. The FDIC then has 30 days to consider the bank’s plan. If 
      the bank’s plan is acceptable, then the FDIC must allow a reasonable time 
      for its implementation. If the plan is unacceptable, the FDIC may issue a 
      Notice of Intention to Issue a section 39 Order directing the bank to 
      correct the deficiency. In most cases, the bank has 14 days to respond. 
      After considering the response, the FDIC may issue an Order. Often the 
      deadlines for correction set forth in the Order will be later than those 
      in the bank’s initial plan because of the lapse of time.</P>
      <P>Thus, Section 39 may be used to correct certain operational 
      deficiencies specified in the guidelines. However, not all deficiencies 
      are covered. Therefore, a section 8(b) cease and desist order, which 
      allows for more flexibility in its areas of coverage, may be necessary. In 
      addition, based upon the facts in a particular case, a consent 8(b) order 
      may be obtained more quickly than section 39 relief given the time frames 
      discussed above.</P>

      <P><B>Conclusion </B></P>
      <P>Sections 38 and 39 provide regulators with non-capital-related 
      enforcement tools that they can use to obtain corrective action or close 
      institutions with serious safety and soundness problems. Specifically, 
      these sections provide for (1) reclassification of a capital category 
      based on non-capital factors, (2) improving management when regulators 
      consider management to be deficient, and (3) supervisory actions based on 
      safety and soundness standards. </P>
      <P>Our review disclosed that provisions of sections 38 and 39 do not 
      provide objective, measurable criteria for implementation and in some 
      instances, placed restrictions on their use. Consequently, the non-capital 
      provisions of section 38 and 39 were seldom used.</P>
      <H4>LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY OPTIONS FOR CONSIDERATION</H4>
      <P>We acknowledge that PCA is one of many supervisory tools and that the 
      FDIC overcame the limitations of sections 38 and 39 through the use of 
      other enforcement actions, such as C&amp;Ds. However, to fulfill the 
      congressional intent and to provide the primary banking regulators with a 
      more effective set of supervisory tools, legislative or regulatory changes 
      may be needed. </P>
      <P>Our draft of this report included six recommendations for legislative 
      or regulatory changes to strengthen PCA provisions. However, in discussing 
      the draft report with DSC officials, they stated that the FDIC does not 
      have the authority to unilaterally initiate and enact such changes. In 
      addition, the officials provided various reasons why the Division 
      concluded that adopting the recommendations would not be productive at 
      this time. Details of DSC’s position are included in the Corporation 
      Comments and OIG Evaluation section of this report and in the 
      Corporation’s written comments included as Appendix VI. Taken as a whole, 
      DSC’s position and related comments had merit. We have, therefore, 
      modified the recommendations to be the following legislative and 
      regulatory options for consideration: </P>
      <OL>
        <LI>Regulatory changes such as making the higher capital expectations 
        specified in the Expanded Guidance on Subprime Loans part of the Call 
        Report instructions, or some other method, to ensure that the reported 
        capital ratios of institutions reflect the risk related to those 
        loans.<BR><BR>
        <LI>Legislative and regulatory changes to add the CAMELS rating or some 
        other objective criteria as the trigger for implementing section 38(g). 
        <BR><BR>
        <LI>Legislative or regulatory changes to remove or lessen the due 
        process provisions imposed by section 38(g). <BR><BR>
        <LI>Legislative and regulatory changes needed to allow implementation of 
        section 38(f)(2) when institutions become “undercapitalized.” <BR><BR>
        <LI>Regulatory changes to add objective or quantifiable criteria, such 
        as CAMELS ratings, to section 39 provisions to trigger actions. <BR><BR>
        <LI>Regulatory changes to make it mandatory to take corrective actions 
        when institutions do not meet section 39 safety and soundness standards. 
        </LI></OL>
      <P>To facilitate consideration of these options to improve the 
      effectiveness of PCA, we will include them in our Semiannual Report to the 
      Congress. We also intend to provide copies of this report to the Senate 
      Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, House Committee on 
      Financial Services, and the Chairman of the Federal Financial Institutions 
      Examination Council (FFIEC) after the next FDIC Audit Committee 
      meeting.</P>
      <H4>CORPORATION COMMENTS AND OIG EVALUATION</H4>
      <P>On September 4, 2003, the Corporation provided its comments on our 
      legislative and regulatory options for consideration. The Corporation’s 
      comments generally agreed with our observations regarding the use and 
      effectiveness of PCA provisions. However, the comments pointed out that 
      the report did not consider the following important issues and factors 
      that would complicate the implementation of proposed options: due process, 
      unintended consequences, and congressional and public sentiment. While we 
      agree that these issues and factors are important, we did not intend our 
      report to discuss every issue and nuance of PCA provisions. Instead, we 
      provided our observations and options for the Congress and the regulators 
      to consider in any reassessment of the PCA provisions. </P>
      <P>The Corporation’s comments also offered other factors that should be 
      considered and included specific comments for each option that we proposed 
      for consideration. However, we would like to provide additional 
      information in response to several statements included in the 
      Corporation’s comments. </P>
      <P>Specifically, the Corporation stated: </P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>The GAO [General Accounting Office} studied the PCA rules in 
        1996, using a sample of 61 banks that had been subject to PCA actions, 
        and issued a report. Although the GAO report noted the inherent 
        limitations of the capital-based safeguards set forth in section 38 and 
        the lack of objective criteria in section 39, it did not make any 
        recommendations to change or amend the law or the implementing 
        regulations. </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>We agree that the 1996 GAO report did not make any recommendations. 
      However, the GAO report points out that few institutions were subject to 
      section 38 enforcement actions from December 1992 through September 1996. 
      In fact, for GAO’s sample of 61 institutions, section 38 directives were 
      used against only 8 institutions. Further, section 39 was not fully 
      implemented until October 1, 1996, only 1 month before GAO issued its 
      report in November 1996. Further, the same report points out that in 1991, 
      the GAO recommended that Congress and the regulators develop a “trip wire” 
      system that would be based on clear, objective criteria as to what would 
      constitute unsafe and unsound conditions and practices and the regulatory 
      actions that would result if institutions violated the specified criteria. 
      This recommendation was adopted and, until it was amended, the original 
      legislation required quantitative standards for two of three areas under 
      section 39. Therefore, we believe our options 2, 3, 5, and 6 only 
      reiterate GAO’s recommendations in 1991 to Congress and the regulators, 
      and we would continue to offer them as options for consideration. </P>
      <P>We acknowledge in our report that the regulators elected not to include 
      higher capital requirements in the risk-based capital framework because of 
      the difficulty in defining the term “subprime.” However, we believe that 
      subprime loans continue to pose a significant risk to the deposit 
      insurance funds. Not establishing a formal method for reporting 
      risk-weighted capital and depending on the periodic examinations to 
      evaluate capital adequacy, in our opinion, do not mitigate the risks posed 
      by subprime loans. Therefore, we would continue to offer option 1 for 
      consideration.</P>
      <P>Finally, in its response to option # 4, the Corporation stated that 
      under section 38(e)(5), an undercapitalized institution may be subject to 
      section 38(f)(2) if the agency determines it is necessary to carry out the 
      purpose of section 38. Thus, section 38(f)(2) is already available to 
      regulators when an institution becomes “undercapitalized.” Our report 
      observes that the authority available to the regulators under section 
      38(f)(2)(F) to require the institution to dismiss or replace bank officers 
      or directors is not being used frequently. Specifically, our report 
      pointed out that of the six of institutions in our sample that reached the 
      “significantly undercapitalized” level and could have been subject to 
      section 38(f)(2)(F) actions, the FDIC used the section authority for only 
      two institutions. This contrasts with the multitude of examples of 
      management deficiencies (included in Appendix IV) that the examiners 
      identified during examinations. Further, our report also pointed out that 
      the two banks for which the FDIC used this provision were closed within a 
      month after the dismissal action was taken. Therefore, we continue to 
      believe that changes to section 38(f)(2) should be made to promote the 
      appropriate use of this important authority for both “undercapitalized” 
      and “significantly undercapitalized” institutions, and we would continue 
      to offer option 4 for consideration.</P>

      <H4>APPENDIX II</H4>
      <P align=center><B>OBJECTIVES, SCOPE, AND METHODOLOGY</B></P>
      <P>The objectives of this review were to determine whether PCA provisions 
      were used as part of the FDIC’s enforcement process and served to reduce 
      the losses to the deposit insurance funds. To achieve the objectives, we 
      conducted in-depth analyses (case studies) of a sample of a total of 11 
      failed and open banks in order to gain insight into the use of PCA 
      provisions. Institutions selected for review included only FDIC-supervised 
      banks. </P>
      <P>To select a sample of banks for our review, we contacted DRR and 
      obtained a list of resolution cases for the period 2000, 2001, and 2002. 
      The list contained the names of 22 banks that have failed or nearly 
      failed, banks in which DRR was conducting work, and banks that DRR was 
      monitoring. We did not test the list for its accuracy or completeness. 
      Using a judgmental sampling approach, and in consultation with DSC and 
      DRR, we selected 11 banks for review: 1 in DSC’s Atlanta region, 5 in the 
      Dallas region (Dallas-2, Memphis-3), 1 in the San Francisco region, and 4 
      in the New York region (New York-2, Boston-2). Based on DSC’s suggestion, 
      we included Victory State Bank in our sample even though it was closed in 
      1999. A listing of the banks we reviewed, eight failed or acquired and 
      three open, is in as Appendix I. The open banks we studied are identified 
      as Open Bank # 1, # 2, and # 3. </P>
      <P>For each bank selected, we reviewed all available DSC files, including: 
      FDIC and state reports of examination; supervisory actions initiated by 
      the regulators, including C&amp;Ds, PCA directives, and MOUs; results of 
      supervisory visits; interoffice memorandums; correspondence between the 
      regulators and bank officials; problem bank memorandums; and memorandums 
      presenting detailed analyses of failures. We may not have reviewed all 
      pertinent documents in cases for which corporate investigators and/or 
      attorneys were using file documents at the time we performed our field 
      visits. Additionally, we held discussions with corporate officials in 
      headquarters offices of DSC, Legal, DRR, and DIR. At the FDIC Regional and 
      Area Offices, we met with DSC regional and area office directors, 
      assistant regional directors, and case managers. In analyzing the banks in 
      our sample, we also reviewed their capital condition for the period 
      covered by our audit. We did not, however, test the accuracy of the 
      capital ratios that DSC had developed and provided to us for this part of 
      our analysis. Following the completion of our analyses, we provided our 
      case histories to DSC, Legal, DRR, and DIR for their review and comment. 
      Their comments were incorporated into our report where appropriate.</P>
      <P>To ensure our understanding of prompt corrective action provisions, we 
      reviewed sections 38 and 39 and other related sections of the FDI Act. In 
      addition, we reviewed the following previous audit reports:</P>
      <UL>
        <LI>The FDIC Office of Inspector General (OIG) Audit Report No. 03-019, 
        entitled <I>The Division of Supervision and Consumer Protection’s 
        Examination Assessment of Subprime Lending</I>, dated March 18, 
        2003;<BR><BR>

        Review of the Failure of the Connecticut Bank of Commerce, Stamford, 
        Connecticut</I>, dated March 10, 2003;<BR><BR>
        <LI>The FDIC OIG Audit Report No. 02-013, entitled <I>The Effectiveness 
        of Prompt Corrective Action Provisions in Preventing or Reducing Losses

        <LI>The GAO report, GAO/GGD 97-18, entitled <I>Implementation of 
        FDICIA’s Prompt Regulatory Action Provisions</I>, dated November 21, 
        1996. </LI></UL>
      <P>We also reviewed the report entitled “Differentiating Among Critically 
      Undercapitalized Banks and Thrifts” dated June 14, 2002. This report was 
      from the FDIC’s former Division of Research and Statistics, which 
      conducted a review of bank failures that occurred from 1994 through 2000 
      and of banks that fell below the 2 percent capital requirement for the 
      critically undercapitalized institutions. The report concluded that, from 
      1994 through 2000, most failures imposed significant costs (as a 
      percentage of assets) on the insurance funds. However, 55 percent of the 
      FDIC-insured institutions that fell below the PCA threshold for critically 
      undercapitalized institutions avoided failure, and about 30 percent of the 
      failed institutions never breached the PCA threshold. </P>
      <P>We limited our assessment of DSC’s system of internal controls to 
      gaining an understanding of the division’s procedures for reporting on 
      undercapitalized institutions and section 38 and 39 provisions. We did not 
      (1) test internal controls, (2) review Government Performance and Results 
      Act reporting, (3) test for fraud or illegal acts, or (4) determine the 
      reliability of computer-processed data obtained from the FDIC’s 
      computerized systems. However, the fact that we did not perform those 
      tests, reviews, or assessment of the reliability of data did not affect 
      our ability to achieve the stated audit objectives or the audit results. 
      The audit was conducted from January 6, 2003 through June 16, 2003 in 
      accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.</P>

      <H4>APPENDIX III</H4>
      <P align=center><B>ADDITIONAL BACKGROUND INFORMATIONON PROMPT CORRECTIVE 
      ACTION PROVISIONS</B></P>
      <P>The FDIC insures the deposits of banking and thrift institutions. 
      However, the FDIC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
      (FRB), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and the Office 
      of Thrift Supervision (OTS) share responsibility for regulating and 
      supervising federally insured banks and thrifts in the United States. The 
      FDIC is the primary federal regulator of state-chartered banks that are 
      not members of the Federal Reserve System; the FRB regulates 
      state-chartered, member banks; the OCC regulates nationally chartered 
      banks; and the OTS regulates all federally insured thrifts, regardless of 
      charter. The regulators carry out their oversight responsibilities 
      primarily by monitoring financial data that institutions file with them, 
      conducting periodic on-site examinations, and taking actions to enforce 
      federal safety and soundness laws and regulations.</P>
      <P>From 1980 through 1990, the failure of hundreds of banks and thrifts 
      threatened the solvency of the federal deposit insurance funds. The 
      insurance fund for banks (the Bank Insurance Fund) had a negative balance 
      for the first time in its history. In addition, the insurance fund for 
      thrifts (the Savings Association Insurance Fund) required a taxpayer 
      bailout. This crisis resulted in deposit insurance fund losses estimated 
      at over $125 billion. One of the many factors contributing to the size of 
      the losses was weakness in federal regulatory oversight. Federal 
      regulators were criticized for not taking prompt and forceful action to 
      minimize or prevent losses to the insurance funds due to bank and thrift 
      failures.</P>
      <P>In response, the United States Congress passed the Federal Deposit 
      Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) to improve the 
      supervision and examination of depository institutions and protect the 
      insurance funds from further losses. Two new sections, sections 38 and 39, 
      were enacted into the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. The provisions 
      required federal regulators to institute a two-part system of regulatory 
      actions that would be triggered when an institution fails to meet minimum 
      capital levels or safety and soundness standards. Enactment of this 
      two-part system was intended to increase the likelihood that regulators 
      would respond promptly and forcefully to prevent or minimize losses to the 
      deposit insurance funds.</P>
      <P>Section 38, <I>Prompt Corrective Action</I>, was codified to 12 U.S.C. 
      1831o and section 39, <I>Standards for Safety and Soundness</I>, was 
      codified to 12 U.S.C. 1831p-1. Section 38 provisions require federal 
      regulators to initiate actions when an institution fails to meet minimum 
      capital levels. Section 39 provisions address safety and soundness 
      standards relating to factors other than capital. </P>
      <P>Section 38(c) made capital the centerpiece of the PCA provisions 
      because funds invested by owners can absorb losses before the institutions 
      become insolvent. In addition, section 38(c) created a capital-based 
      framework for bank and thrift oversight that is based on the placement of 
      financial institutions into one of five capital categories. Section 38 
      required regulators to define criteria for four of the five categories, 
      which are identified as well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, 
      undercapitalized, and significantly undercapitalized. It also required the 
      regulators to set the threshold for the fifth category, which is 
      identified as critically undercapitalized, at no less than 2 percent of 
      tangible equity capital. The section also established a system of 
      mandatory supervisory actions that are to be triggered by an institution’s 
      capital levels. Section 38 restricts depository institutions in the three 
      lowest capital categories from engaging in certain activities that could 
      increase the risk of loss to the federal deposit insurance funds. Table 8 
      shows the minimum capital levels established by the regulators for each of 
      the five categories defined by section 38(c).</P>

      <P>Source: Section 38 of the <I>FDI Act</I> and 57 Federal Register 
      44866-01.</P>
      <P>The regulators jointly developed the implementing regulations for 
      section 38 based on the criteria for the top four capital categories on 
      international capital standards and adopted section 38’s tangible equity 
      ratio of 2 percent as the threshold for the critically undercapitalized 
      category. A well-capitalized or adequately capitalized institution must 
      meet or exceed all three capital ratios for its capital category. To be 
      deemed undercapitalized or significantly undercapitalized, an institution 
      need only fall below one of the three ratios listed for its capital 
      category. </P>
      <P>Section 7 of the FDI Act requires all insured financial institutions to 
      submit Call Reports or Thrift Financial Reports (TFR) to their primary 
      federal regulators each quarter. Primary regulators determine the capital 
      categories for section 38 purposes using the information that institutions 
      provide in their Call Reports or TFRs. Under the banking agencies’ 
      risk-based guidelines, assets and credit equivalent amounts of derivatives 
      and off-balance sheet items are assigned to one of several broad risk 
      categories according to obligor, or, if relevant, the guarantor or the 
      nature of the collateral. The aggregate dollar amount in each risk 
      category is then multiplied by the risk weight associated with that 
      category. The resulting weighted values from each of the risk categories 
      are added together, and generally, this sum is the bank’s total 
      risk-weighted assets, which comprises the denominator of the risk-based 
      capital ratio. Appendix A to part 325 of the FDIC Regulations establishes 
      FDIC’s Statement of Policy on Risk-Based Capital. The risk-weights 
      associated with various asset types that institutions should apply to 
      their assets are included under “Schedule RC-R – Regulatory Capital,” of 
      Call Report Instructions. The Total Risk-Based capital ratio consists of 
      the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital divided by risk-weighted assets. Tier 
      1 capital consists primarily of tangible equity. Tier 2 capital includes 
      subordinated debt, loan loss reserves, and certain other instruments. 
      Leverage capital is computed without risk weights. </P>
      <P>To simplify and illustrate the computation of leverage and Tier 1 
      risk-based capital, the example below considers an institution with assets 
      of $200 and $8 in Tier 1 capital. (Note: Section 38 requires three 
      measures of capital—Total Risk-based, Tier 1 Risk-based, and Leverage 
      capital. For the sake of simplicity and to explain the concept of 
      risk-based capital, we used only two measures in this example.) </P>
      <UL>
        <LI>If that institution’s assets had a risk-weight of 100 percent, both 
        its leverage and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios would be 4 percent. 
        The leverage capital ratio is computed by dividing $8 in capital by $200 
        in assets. The Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio is computed as follows: 
        $8/$200 ($200 multiplied by 1 for 100 percent risk weight). So, for PCA 
        purposes, this bank would be considered “Adequately capitalized.” 
        <BR><BR>
        <LI>If that same institution’s assets had a risk-weight of 150 percent, 
        its leverage capital would still be 4 percent ($8 divided by $200 in 
        assets). However, the risk-based capital for this institution would be 
        2.67 percent computed as follows: $8 in capital divided by $300 ($200 in 
        assets multiplied by 1.5 for a risk weight of 150 percent). With its 
        Tier 1 risk-based capital of 2.67 percent, this institution would be 
        considered “significantly undercapitalized” for PCA purposes. </LI></UL>
      <P>Depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital levels face 
      several mandatory restrictions or actions. Section 38(e) provisions 
      applicable to restrictions on undercapitalized institutions mandate that 
      federal regulators require institutions to (1) submit capital restoration 
      plans; (2) restrict the growth of assets; and (3) obtain prior approval 
      for additional acquisitions, branches, and new lines of business. Section 
      38 allows regulators to take additional actions against an 
      undercapitalized institution, if considered necessary. </P>
      <P>Under section 38, institutions that are classified as significantly 
      undercapitalized face more stringent restrictions. Regulators must take 
      one or more of the following actions:</P>
      <UL>
        <LI>Require the sale of equity or debt or, under certain circumstances, 
        requiring institutions to be acquired by or merged with another 
        institution. 
        <LI>Restrict otherwise allowable transactions with affiliates. 
        <LI>Restrict the interest rate paid on deposits by institutions. 
        <LI>Impose more stringent asset growth limitations than required for 
        undercapitalized institutions or require the institution to reduce its 
        total assets. 
        <LI>Require the institution, or its subsidiaries, to alter, reduce, or 
        terminate an activity that the regulator deems excessively risky to the 
        institution. 
        <LI>Improve management by (1) ordering a new election for the 
        institution’s board of directors, (2) dismissing directors or senior

        qualified senior executive officers. 
        <LI>Prohibit acceptance, renewal, or rollover of deposits from 
        correspondent banks. 
        <LI>Require prior approval for capital distributions from holding 
        companies having control of the institution. 
        <LI>Require divestiture by (1) the institution of any subsidiary that 
        poses significant risk to the institution, (2) the parent company of any 
        nondepository affiliate that poses a significant risk to the 
        institution, and/or (3) any controlling company of the institution if 
        that divestiture would improve the institution’s financial condition. 
        <LI>Prohibit payment of bonuses to or increasing compensation of senior 
        executive officers without prior approval. </LI></UL>
      <P>Each regulator is responsible for taking the actions included in 
      section 38 for the institutions it supervises. When an institution becomes 
      critically undercapitalized, federal regulators must either appoint the 
      FDIC as conservator or receiver or take other action to minimize losses to 
      the insurance funds within 90 days of becoming aware of the institution’s 
      condition. Section 38 also prohibits critically undercapitalized 
      institutions from doing any of the following without the FDIC’s prior 
      written approval:</P>
      <UL>
        <LI>Entering into any material transaction (such as investments, 
        expansion, and asset sales), other than in the normal course of 
        business. 
        <LI>Extending credit for any highly leveraged transaction. 
        <LI>Amending the charter or bylaws, except to carry out any other 
        requirement of any law, regulation, or order. 
        <LI>Making any material changes in accounting methods. 
        <LI>Engaging in any covered transactions. 
        <LI>Paying excessive compensation or bonuses. 
        <LI>Paying interest on new or renewed liabilities at a rate that would 
        increase the institution’s weighted average cost of funds to a level 
        significantly exceeding the prevailing rates of interest on insured 
        deposits in the institution’s normal market area. 
        <LI>Paying principal or interest on the institution’s subordinated debt 
        beginning 60 days after becoming critically undercapitalized. </LI></UL>
      <P>Section 38(d) provisions applicable to all institutions prohibit them 
      from making capital distributions or paying management fees that would 
      drop them into the undercapitalized category. In addition, according to 
      section 29 of the FDI Act, codified to 12 U.S.C. §1831f, an adequately 
      capitalized institution cannot accept brokered deposits without a waiver 
      from the FDIC.</P>
      <P>Finally, section 38 permits regulators to, in effect, downgrade an 
      institution by one capital category if the institution is in unsafe or 
      unsound condition or if it is engaging in an unsafe and unsound practice. 
      For example, regulators can downgrade an adequately capitalized 
      institution to the undercapitalized category if the institution received a 
      less than satisfactory rating in its most recent examination report for 
      asset quality, management, earnings, or liquidity. By downgrading an 
      institution, the regulators can require the institution’s compliance with 
      those restrictions applicable to undercapitalized institutions. This 
      provision allows regulators to take action against an institution that 
      poses a danger to the deposit insurance funds from factors other than its 
      capital level. </P>
      <P>Further, to limit deposit insurance losses caused by factors other than 
      inadequate capital, Section 39 of the FDI Act requires each regulator to 
      establish certain safety and soundness standards related to (1) operations 
      and management; (2) asset quality, earnings and stock valuation; and (3) 
      compensation. To allow for flexibility among the regulators based on the 
      scope and nature of the agencies’ activities, the regulators elected to 
      adopt broad guidelines instead of strict numerical standards. The 
      guidelines were designed to prompt depository institutions to implement 
      measures that would assist in identifying emerging problems in areas other 
      than capital and to correct those problems before capital became impaired.

      <H4>APPENDIX IV</H4>
      <P align=center><B>EXAMPLES OF DEFICIENCIES IDENTIFIED BY 
EXAMINERS</B></P>
      <P>In reviewing the eight banks in which PCA directives were used, we 
      observed that in all cases, the examiners identified deteriorating asset 
      quality, which culminated from deficiencies related to bank management 
      and/or board oversight. Examples of deficiencies identified included the 
      following:</P>
      <UL>
        <LI>Problems related to one person dominating the institution.<BR><BR>
        <UL>
          <LI>In the case of the Bank of Honolulu, the Chairman of the Board, 
          who owned over 99 percent of the bank, engaged in a number of insider 
          transactions with foreign individuals to whom the bank had extended $6 
          million in unsecured international loans. These loans played a 
          significant role in the eventual failure of the bank.<BR><BR>
          <LI>The extremely weak asset quality of the Bank of Sierra Blanca was 
          attributable to the reckless and self-serving lending practices of its 
          President, who resigned prior to the bank’s failure. This individual 
          apparently originated and approved loans in violation of state lending 
          limits, released collateral without corresponding reductions in the 
          related loan, and promoted the interests of another entity that 
          employed him.<BR><BR>
          <LI>The closure of Victory State Bank was primarily the result of 
          problems stemming from the Chairman’s disregard for the bank’s 
          financial well being. The Chairman’s excessive compensation over the 
          years was the major contributor to the bank’s operating losses and 
          depletion of capital. He dominated all aspects of Victory’s operations 
          and failed to implement corrective measures to address the continuing 
          deterioration of the bank’s condition, primarily resulting from weak 
          underwriting and credit administration practices.<BR><BR></LI></UL>
        <LI>Weak or inadequate Board oversight. <BR><BR>
        <UL>
          <LI>In the case of Victory State Bank, in spite of the fact that the 
          FDIC questioned the reasonableness of the Chairman’s compensation, the 
          Board took no action regarding the Chairman’s excessive compensation 
          or the detrimental influence he exerted on the bank.<BR><BR>
          <LI>In the case of Salt Lick Bank, the examiners noted that the Board 
          of Directors permitted the President of the bank to operate the 
          institution in a hazardous and objectionable manner. <BR><BR>
          <LI>In November 2001, the FDIC examiners dropped the composite CAMELS 
          rating from a 2 to a 4 for Open Bank # 2. The examiners noted that the 
          increase in its risk profile was due to a marked decline in the credit 
          quality of subprime assets, a significantly under-funded ALLL, an 
          inadequate capital level, imprudent credit management practices, and 
          other managerial deficiencies. Examiners attributed many of the 
          problems to weak Board oversight, particularly in the areas of credit 
          standards and underwriting. <BR><BR></LI></UL>
        <LI>Insider lending or related abuses. <BR><BR>
        <UL>
          <LI>In the case of Home State Bank, state examiners determined that a 
          sizable portion of the bank’s asset quality problems were directly 
          related to the former Board Chairman and related family and business 
          interests. Specifically, loans directly tied to or influenced by the 
          former Chairman comprised 35 percent of classified loans as of 
          December 1999, at which time the bank’s capital category was lowered 
          from “adequately capitalized” to “significantly undercapitalized.” 
          (Note: Classified loans are loans that are not protected adequately by 
          the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or the 
          collateral pledged. Therefore, full liquidation of the debt may be in 
          jeopardy.) This individual resigned before the bank was 
closed.<BR><BR>
          <LI>Without informing the regulators, the Bank of Alamo’s Chairman of 
          the Board had pledged his bank ownership as collateral on a loan of 
          approximately $4.2 million because he was experiencing great financial 
          difficulty. Examiners also noted that the Chairman and the Bank of 
          Alamo were named as defendants in a complex lawsuit involving several 
          interests of the Chairman. The plaintiff in this lawsuit alleged 
          specific acts of fraud, racketeering, and other violations. In 
          addition, the examiners noted that the Chairman was continuing to make 
          decisions that adversely impacted the bank, including drawing various 
          personal financial benefits without seeking Board approval. 
        </LI></UL><BR><BR>
        <LI>Lack of expertise and/or qualified personnel.<BR><BR>
        <UL>
          <LI>Shortly after the First Alliance Bank and Trust Company opened, a 
          joint visitation by the state and the FDIC disclosed deficiencies 
          related to many of the bank’s policies and procedures and a need for 
          management to develop a strategic plan. Problems at the institution 
          were magnified by changes in leadership. During the bank’s first 2 
          years, the bank had three different presidents with different goals 
          and objectives. In addition, during the bank’s 4-year existence, six 
          of the initial directors resigned, four of whom were the only board 
          members with prior banking experience. Other directors who had joined 
          the Board after the bank was established also departed. Also, 
          management continuously deviated from the business plan. <BR><BR>
          <LI>An individual who had been a Board member for 23 years took 
          control of policy-making and day-to-day operations of the Bank of 
          Alamo without formal bank training. Further, he appointed another 
          individual, a veterinarian, as President.<BR><BR></LI></UL>
        <LI>Holding company control.<BR><BR>
        <UL>
          <LI>For Open Bank # 1, examiners reported that Board oversight was 
          lacking and that all critical management decisions and functions were 
          performed by officers of affiliated entities of the parent company. 
          The parent of Open Bank # 1 also owned a national bank. (Note: 
          According to DSC, the parent is not required to register as a bank 
          holding company under the Bank Holding Companies Act. The parent owns 
          the national bank, which is a “bank” as defined under the BHCA, as 
          amended by the Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987 (CEBA). 
          However, under grandfathering provisions of CEBA, the parent is not 
          required to register as a bank holding company because the national 
          bank, which takes demand deposits but does not make commercial loans, 
          did not fall within the BHCA definition of the term “bank” prior to 
          the enactment of CEBA. Under CEBA, the state non-member bank is not 
          considered a “bank” for purposes of the BHCA. Accordingly, the parent 
          is not subject to examination by the Federal Reserve.) In addition, 
          examiners noted that Open Bank # 1 (in reality, the parent) had 
          commenced an aggressive strategy for loan growth that contributed to 
          significant deterioration in the bank’s asset quality. <BR><BR>
          <LI>For Open Bank # 3, examiners noted that the bank’s Board had 
          allowed officers of the parent company to make significant decisions. 
          In addition, the examiners noted that the organizational structure of 
          the bank and its position within the parent company did not provide 
          the bank’s Board with the necessary independence to accomplish its 
          fiduciary responsibilities. The parent company of Open Bank # 3 also 
          owned a national bank, and examiners noted that the state non-member 
          bank was being operated as a branch of the national bank.

      Action (PCA) as Part of the Enforcement Process</I> (Assignment No. 
      2003-016)</P>
      <P>Thank you for the opportunity to review and comment upon your report. 
      The stated objective of the audit associated with this report is to 
      determine whether Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) provisions were used as 
      part of the FDIC’s enforcement process and served to reduce the losses to 
      the deposit insurance funds. (Note: FDIC Office of Inspector General 
      Report: <I>The Role of Prompt Corrective Action as Part of the Enforcement 
      Process</I> (Assignment Number 2003-016), p. 1.) This audit covers a 
      sample of 11 FDIC-supervised institutions and is an expansion of an 
      earlier audit that focused on whether prompt corrective action provisions 
      were implemented in a timely manner.</P>
      <P>We have closely reviewed the results of this audit. This report has 
      been distributed to our Regional Directors and all other managers involved 
      in the enforcement action process for their review.</P>
      <P>With respect to the audit’s stated objective, the report’s findings are 
      summarized on page 5 as follows:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE><I>The FDIC generally used PCA directives as part of the 
        supervisory process, in conjunction with other supervisory actions, once 
        institutions’ capital levels reached designated thresholds. 
        Specifically, the FDIC used PCA directives in 8 of 11 institutions that 
        we reviewed, and its use of PCA served to prevent or reduce losses to 
        the deposit insurance funds.</I> </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>We appreciate and concur with the report’s favorable finding with 
      respect to the FDIC’s appropriate use of PCA. We believe that PCA, as 
      currently structured, has been a valuable addition to the enforcement 
      tools available to the federal banking agencies.</P>
      <P>The report also focuses considerable attention on the general 
      effectiveness of PCA as an enforcement tool. In summary, the report states 
      the following:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE><I>While PCA directives were used in 8 of 11 institutions in 
        our sample, we identified a number of factors that delay the use of 
        section 38 and impact the effectiveness of its capital related 
        provisions. (Note: OIG Report, p. 5.)<BR><BR>[With regards to the use of 
        non-capital factors on which PCA directives can be taken,] our analyses 
        of these sections indicated that these provisions do not provide 
        objective or measurable criteria for implementation and, in some 
        instances, placed restrictions on their use. Consequently, these 
        provisions were seldom used, and the FDIC <B>may [emphasis added]</B> 
        have lost opportunities to initiate additional supervisory actions to 
        address problems. (Note: OIG Report, p. 7-8.)</I> </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>To address these issues, the draft report made 6 recommendations “…to 
      fulfill the Congressional intent and to provide the primary banking 
      regulators with a more effective set of supervisory tools.” (Note: OIG 
      Report, p. 50.) Following discussions with DSC staff, the OIG revised its 
      formal recommendations to options for consideration by the federal banking 
      agencies and Congress.</P>
      <P>We have carefully considered the options proposed in this report, as 
      well as other important issues and factors in regard to the role of PCA as 
      part of the enforcement process. While we appreciate that the focus and 
      intent of the options are to improve the effectiveness of the PCA process, 
      we do not believe that the proposed changes are necessary. </P>
      <P>Prompt Corrective Action is but one of many enforcement tools available 
      to effect corrective measures in problem institutions. Since the 
      implementation of the PCA requirements in 1992, the FDIC has taken 
      enforcement actions on over 300 banks. Based on this experience, we 
      believe we currently have an adequate and effective set of enforcement 
      tools to deal with problem institutions. In fact, the report acknowledges 
      that the enforcement actions already in place through section 8 actions in 
      this sample of banks mandated many of the same actions as if a PCA action 
      had been taken.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, there are several important issues and factors that are 
      either not discussed in the report or are not fully explained. These 
      include:</P>
      <OL>
        <LI>the need to provide adequate procedural protections to insured 
        institutions and individuals prior to the agencies taking any 
        discretionary action; 
        <LI>the recognition that there are many circumstances where PCA actions 
        could result in unnecessary and counterproductive actions being taken 
        against financially sound institutions; and 
        <LI>the fact that the agencies have jointly solicited public comments on 
        these issues on several occasions before the rules were implemented, and 
        the overwhelming number of commenters were opposed to imposing a rigid 
        set of specific standards. </LI></OL>
      <P>We have provided a more detailed discussion of these issues, as well as 
      comments on the specific options listed in the report, on the pages that 
      follow.</P>
      <P>The proposed changes to the existing enforcement framework are 
      significant. We do not believe that Congress, the banking industry, or the 
      other regulators would be receptive to proposals that increase the 
      application of the prescriptions in sections 38 and 39 unless there are 
      clear and convincing benefits to the insurance funds. Without such 
      evidence, the pursuit of legislative and regulatory changes to PCA does 
      not appear to be a productive use of resources.</P>
      <P>However, we will continue to review and consider the impact on PCA of 
      regulatory changes to the risk-based capital requirements. The risk-based 
      capital requirements have been revised several times since the passage of 
      PCA to cover interest rate risk, nontraditional financial products, and 
      expanded credit risk standards. There are several interagency efforts 
      ongoing regarding risk-based capital standards and the impact of these 
      changes on the PCA regulations is an important factor that receives full 
      and complete consideration.</P>
      <P><B>General Comments on the Report’s Options for Consideration</B></P>
      <P>The report focuses on factors that delay the use of section 38 and 
      impact the effectiveness of its capital related provisions. Specifically, 
      these include:</P>
      <UL>
        <LI>Capital can be a lagging indicator of an institution’s financial 
        health. 
        <LI>Capital ratios reported by institutions in their Call Reports did 
        not always reflect actual financial conditions. 
        <LI>Institutions increased their capital before or after the issuance of 
        PCA directives or closure. 
        <LI>The current method of computing capital does not take into account 
        risks related to subprime loans. </LI></UL>
      <P>We agree that these are important factors. It is important to note, 
      however, that all these issues, with the exception of the subprime issue, 
      were fully considered during the rulemaking process when the PCA 
      regulations were implemented. The results in this report do not provide 
      any new or unknown factors since that time.</P>
      <P>As noted above, the report does not adequately consider several 
      important issues and factors that would complicate the implementation of 
      the options proposed or would discourage their adoption altogether. These 
      include:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE><B><I>Due process.</I></B> After considerable Congressional 
        debate, the PCA rules included a separate procedure that allows 
        regulators to subject an institution to more stringent treatment based 
        on supervisory factors other than capital (the “Reclassification Rule”). 
        The process includes adequate procedural protections to insured 
        institutions and individuals incident to the agencies taking any 
        discretionary actions. The FDIC is required by statute to prove 
        particular statutory elements and that certain due process procedures 
        are followed in the use of these enforcement powers.<BR><BR>While the 
        report does note the existence of this treatment and these restrictions, 
        it does not explain the rationale behind these protections. Furthermore, 
        the report does not investigate whether these protections are too 
        restrictive or cause significant harm to the insurance funds. If the 
        regulations were changed to include a trigger for the PCA provisions 
        other than capital, these protections would be greatly 
        diminished.<BR><BR><B><I>Unintended consequences.</I></B> The use of 
        triggers such as CAMELS ratings or other criteria would be a fundamental 
        change to the PCA framework that would unduly restrict regulatory 
        flexibility and discretion. These triggers would create many 
        circumstances where PCA actions could result in unnecessary and 
        counterproductive actions being taken against financially sound 
        institutions. We do not believe there is a set of measures or criteria 
        that would be appropriate for all institutions given their differing 
        sizes, types of activities, risk profiles and levels of management 
        expertise. <BR><BR>As for CAMELS, while there are numerical ratings 
        resulting from the evaluation of an institution’s condition and risk 
        management practices, the analysis is subjective and the evaluation 
        factors aren’t tied to objective measures and criteria. In our 
        experience, there are many cases, particularly for smaller institutions 
        whose loans are all tied to the local economy, where, despite good 
        management and compliance with sound policies and procedures, economic 
        factors outside management’s control has adversely affected asset 
        quality and resulted in a less than satisfactory CAMELS rating. The 
        capital ratios of these institutions often have been well above the well 
        capitalized threshold, in part because management maintained higher 
        capital levels so the institution could weather this sort of situation 
        and work its way out of it. We do not think we should unduly restrict 
        our regulatory discretion and flexibility in situations such as 
        this.<BR><BR><B><I>Congressional and public sentiment.</I></B> The 
        current enforcement framework has been established through extensive 
        Congressional debate and an exhaustive public review and comment 
        process. Section 38 was written to require that the PCA rules tie into 
        the agencies’ existing capital rules only after extensive Congressional 
        debate and public comment. With regard to section 39, the Standards for 
        Safety and Soundness, the agencies solicited public comments on 3 
        separate occasions before the rule was implemented. The overwhelming 
        number of commenters preferred general rather than specific standards. 
        The commenters argued that imposing a rigid set of specific standards on 
        an industry as diverse as banking would be overly complex and 
        burdensome, and potentially could lead to excessive micro-management of 
        the industry. The proposed changes in the report regarding section 39 
        are in direct conflict with these comments and the structure of the 
        regulation that was established in response to these comments and 
        concerns. </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Other important factors that should be considered include:</P>
      <UL>
        <LI>Many of the PCA provisions are directed at actions that either 
        require the institution to retain capital, restore capital, or sell 
        additional capital, thus attempting to limit loss to the deposit 
        insurance funds. PCA actions really do not directly address the 
        practices or conditions that caused the problems or prescribe actions to 
        correct these problems. The regulators use their other enforcement 
        powers to directly address these practices and conditions.<BR><BR>
        <LI>While the report acknowledges that infusions of capital strengthen 
        the condition of an institution, it states that institutions do this to 
        avoid implementation of or to terminate PCA directives. However, the 
        report does not acknowledge that once the FDIC has issued a PCA 
        directive, it contains language that the directive shall not be set 
        aside, modified, or otherwise terminated without the prior written 
        approval of the FDIC. Thus, an infusion of capital does not 
        automatically terminate a PCA directive. We also do not believe that the 
        report has adequately considered and explained the interagency aspects 
        (and thus the need solicit the views and support of the other agencies 
        before we propose regulatory changes) of these rules. <BR><BR>
        <LI>The GAO studied the PCA rules in 1996, using a sample of 61 banks 
        that had been subject to PCA actions, and issued a report. Although the 
        GAO report noted the inherent limitations of the capital-based 
        safeguards set forth in section 38 and the lack of objective criteria in 
        section 39, it did not make any recommendations to change or amend the 
        law or the implementing regulations. </LI></UL>
      <P><B>Response to Specific Options Listed in the Report</B></P>
      <P>The first option deals with the factor of accounting for risk 
      associated with subprime loans. </P>
      <OL>
        <LI><I>Regulatory changes such as making the higher capital expectations 
        specified in the FFIEC Expanded Guidance on Subprime Loans part of the 
        Call Report instructions, or some other method, to ensure that the 
        reported capital ratios of institutions with subprime loans reflect the 
        risk related to those loans.</I> 
        <P><B><I>Response:</I></B> The FFIEC cannot impose capital reporting 
        requirements based on the higher capital expectations discussed in the 
        January 31, 2001, Expanded Guidance for Subprime Lending Programs 
        (Subprime Guidance). The Call Report instructions for the regulatory 
        capital schedule (Schedule RC-R) require banks to report based on the 
        agencies' regulatory capital standards, which have been established 
        through rulemaking. </P>
        <P>The Subprime Guidance, including the higher capital expectations 
        discussed therein, is not a formal rule. Thus, in order to convert the 
        factors outlined in the Subprime Guidance into an explicit capital 
        requirement for all subprime lenders, we would have to go through the 
        rulemaking process to incorporate higher capital requirements for 
        subprime loans into the risk-based capital framework. The agencies 
        carefully considered this option when developing the January 2001 
        guidance, but elected not to do so for several reasons. Among these 
        reasons is the difficulty in defining the term “subprime” and the broad 
        spectrum of credit and other risks posed by subprime lending. The 
        agencies determined, after considerable debate that lasted well over a 
        year, that the capital framework for subprime lending should be 
        sufficiently flexible to reflect the significant variance in the 
        relative quality of subprime loan portfolios and in the corresponding 
        risk management programs of individual subprime lenders. Such 
        flexibility is best achieved outside the scope of a formal rule. 
        Instead, an institution has to self-identify its appropriate level of 
        capital and document its methodology, and the examiner must evaluate the 
        institution’s self assessments as well as its overall capital adequacy. 
        Therefore, the verification of higher risk weightings is dependent on 
        the examination process itself, and it would be virtually impossible to 
        enforce higher risk weightings using the current reporting structure. 
        </P>
        <P>This proposal likely arises out of the observation noted on page 31 
        of the report, which states, “…under the current method of reporting, 
        institutions do not risk-weight subprime loans in their Call Reports as 
        suggested by the Expanded Guidance, resulting in inflated capital 
        ratios, which may delay initiation of a PCA directive.” This is not 
        necessarily true in all cases. An institution can be required to 
        risk-weight its subprime loans at greater than 100% and to reflect this 
        treatment in its Call Report by incorporating a specific requirement to 
        do so in a formal enforcement action such as a C&amp;D. The FDIC has 
        incorporated such provisions in the Orders of a few subprime lenders for 
        which it is the primary supervisor. For these institutions, the higher 
        capital levels that would otherwise be held pursuant to informal 
        guidance have become formal requirements, thus the higher risk-weighting 
        on the Call Report schedule is appropriate. An example of this is 
        included in the report with respect to Open Bank #2, in which the FDIC 
        has effectively made a higher risk-weighting for subprime loans a formal 
        requirement through a cease and desist order. However, in other cases 
        where banks have voluntarily agreed to hold more capital against its 
        subprime loans in accordance with the Subprime Guidance, they would 
        continue to risk-weight their subprime loans at not more than 100% in 
        the Call Report.</P>
        <P>We recognize that the intent of this option is to provide the 
        agencies with better, more frequent information about the risks inherent 
        in subprime loan portfolios. This was also the intent of the two 
        separate FFIEC proposals, published for comment in May 2000 and July 
        2002, to collect subprime loan data on the Call Reports. The FFIEC chose 
        not to implement either of these proposals after careful and lengthy 
        consideration of the comments received. The agencies concluded, most 
        recently in December 2002, that the examination process should continue 
        to be the focal point of the supervision of the subprime lending 
        activities. </P>
        <P>Since this report does not provide any new or additional information 
        that was not considered at the time that the Subprime Guidance was 
        developed or when the FFIEC elected not to include subprime loan data in 
        the Call Report, we do not think it is worthwhile to revisit these 
        issues at this time. </P></LI></OL>
      <P>The other 5 options are intended to improve the effectiveness of 
      sections 38 and 39. While we do not dispute the assertion that the 
      implementation of these proposed changes would make sections 38 and 39 
      have a greater impact on a larger number of institutions, we do not 
      believe that this would be fulfilling the Congressional intent or prove 
      beneficial in a number of circumstances. The issues previously discussed 
      in this response apply to these 5 options as a group and individually. 
      Specifically, the report proposes the following options for 
      consideration:</P>
      <OL start=2>
        <LI><I>Legislative and regulatory changes to add the CAMELS rating or 
        some other objective criteria as the trigger for implementing section 
        38(g).<BR><BR>
        <LI>Legislative or regulatory changes to remove or lessen the due 
        process provisions imposed by section 38(g). 
        <P><B>Response:</I></B> For a section 38(g) reclassification, the FDIC 
        is required to make a determination, after notice and a hearing, that 
        the institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition or is engaging in 
        an unsafe or unsound practice under section 8(b)(8) of the Federal 
        Deposit Insurance Act. The definition of an “unsafe or unsound 
        condition” has long been left to agency discretion, and such has been 
        upheld by the courts. There appears to be no reason to require the FDIC 
        to define the term objectively simply for PCA reasons. Indeed, doing so 
        may likely limit rather than expand the use of PCA. We also do not think 
        that Congress or the industry would be receptive to a request to remove 
        the procedural protections of insured institutions and individuals. It 
        should be noted that the current scheme of PCA has been generally 
        criticized as lacking in due process because, unlike other enforcement 
        actions, there is no formal hearing process, only an informal agency 
        hearing. This scheme of capital based triggers has been approved by the 
        courts while not requiring more formal and lengthier procedures. It is 
        very questionable whether the use of “objective measures” as a trigger 
        would receive such approval.</P>
        <P>Also, the report states that these proposed changes are based, in 
        part, on the conclusion that institutions avoided implementation of PCA 
        directives by increasing capital before the issuance of a PCA directive. 
        While we agree that an infusion of capital before PCA is used would 
        preclude the use of PCA, it certainly would not preclude other 
        supervisory approaches that might be more appropriate in such 
        circumstances.</P>
        <LI><I>Legislative and regulatory changes needed to allow implementation 
        of section 38(f)(2) when institutions become “undercapitalized.”</I> 
        <P><B><I>Response:</I></B> According to the Legal Division, section 
        38(f)(2) is already available to institutions other than those that are 
        significantly undercapitalized. PCA provides that an undercapitalized 
        institution without an acceptable capital plan is subject to section 
        38(f)(2), and under 38(e)(5), an undercapitalized institution may be 
        subject to section 38(f)(2) if the agency determines it is necessary to 
        carry out the purposes of section 38. Thus, section 38(f)(2) is already 
        available to regulators when an institution becomes 
        ‘undercapitalized.’”</P>
        <LI><I>Regulatory changes to add objective measures or quantifiable 
        criteria, such as CAMELS ratings, to Section 39 provisions to trigger 
        actions.</I><BR><BR>
        <LI><I>Regulatory changes to make it mandatory to take corrective 
        actions when institutions do not meet section 39 safety and soundness 
        standards.</I> 
        <P><B><I>Response:</I></B> The guidelines for section 39 were enacted 
        after a very lengthy process that involved 3 separate solicitations for 
        public comments. Section 39, as originally passed in 1991, sought to 
        have the agencies enact stringent regulations. However, after the 
        overwhelming number of public comments were opposed to such stringent 
        objective measures and quantifiable criteria, Congress amended section 
        39, retroactive to its enactment, to provide the agencies more 
        discretion and to “remove regulatory micromanagement.” (Note: See H.R. 
        Rep. No. 652, 103d Cong., 2d Sess. 174-75(1994);139 Cong. Rec. H10,516 
        (daily ed. Nov.21, 1993).) The current balance between sections 38 &amp; 
        39, and the use of section 8 and other enforcement powers is adequate 
        for the FDIC’s needs. Generally, section 8 actions have a much broader 
        scope and are specifically tailored to the institution. There is no 
        clear or convincing evidence in this report that more stringent measures 
        to section 39 are needed, and nor should these “guidelines” be changed 
        to standards that require mandatory actions.</P></LI></OL>
