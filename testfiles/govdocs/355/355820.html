Sorting Groups
==============

   The `C-c C-s' (`gnus-group-sort-groups') command sorts the group
buffer according to the function(s) given by the
`gnus-group-sort-function' variable.  Available sorting functions
include:

`gnus-group-sort-by-alphabet'
     Sort the group names alphabetically.  This is the default.

`gnus-group-sort-by-real-name'
     Sort the group alphabetically on the real (unprefixed) group names.

`gnus-group-sort-by-level'
     Sort by group level.

`gnus-group-sort-by-score'
     Sort by group score.  See <A HREF="gnus.info,.GroupScore.html">Group Score</A>.

`gnus-group-sort-by-rank'
     Sort by group score and then the group level.  The level and the
     score are, when taken together, the group's "rank".  *Note Group
     Score::.

`gnus-group-sort-by-unread'
     Sort by number of unread articles.

`gnus-group-sort-by-method'
     Sort alphabetically on the select method.

   `gnus-group-sort-function' can also be a list of sorting functions.
In that case, the most significant sort key function must be the last
one.

   There are also a number of commands for sorting directly according to
some sorting criteria:

`G S a'
     Sort the group buffer alphabetically by group name
     (`gnus-group-sort-groups-by-alphabet').

`G S u'
     Sort the group buffer by the number of unread articles
     (`gnus-group-sort-groups-by-unread').

`G S l'
     Sort the group buffer by group level
     (`gnus-group-sort-groups-by-level').

`G S v'
     Sort the group buffer by group score
     (`gnus-group-sort-groups-by-score').  See <A HREF="gnus.info,.GroupScore.html">Group Score</A>.

`G S r'
     Sort the group buffer by group rank
     (`gnus-group-sort-groups-by-rank').  See <A HREF="gnus.info,.GroupScore.html">Group Score</A>.

`G S m'
     Sort the group buffer alphabetically by backend name
     (`gnus-group-sort-groups-by-method').

   When given a prefix, all these commands will sort in reverse order.

   You can also sort a subset of the groups:

`G P a'
     Sort the process/prefixed groups in the group buffer
     alphabetically by group name
     (`gnus-group-sort-selected-groups-by-alphabet').

`G P u'
     Sort the process/prefixed groups in the group buffer by the number
     of unread articles (`gnus-group-sort-selected-groups-by-unread').

`G P l'
     Sort the process/prefixed groups in the group buffer by group level
     (`gnus-group-sort-selected-groups-by-level').

`G P v'
     Sort the process/prefixed groups in the group buffer by group score
     (`gnus-group-sort-selected-groups-by-score').  See <A HREF="gnus.info,.GroupScore.html">Group Score</A>.

`G P r'
     Sort the process/prefixed groups in the group buffer by group rank
     (`gnus-group-sort-selected-groups-by-rank').  See <A HREF="gnus.info,.GroupScore.html">Group Score</A>.

`G P m'
     Sort the process/prefixed groups in the group buffer
     alphabetically by backend name
     (`gnus-group-sort-selected-groups-by-method').
