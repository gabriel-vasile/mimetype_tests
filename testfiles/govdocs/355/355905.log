 PROGRAM TO MAKE AN SIS SCIENCE FILE CLEANED OF ANOMALOUS PIXELS.
 
 * Anomalous pixels may consist of at least two populations.
 
 1. Persistent HOT pixels are removed by comparing to the chip mean.
 
 2. Flickering WARM pixels are removed by comparing to the cell mean.
 
 3. In faint areas (zero bgd), flickering pixels are removed with a
    cutoff threshold.
 
 Hints:
 Choose cell size and thresholds based on the expected background and the PSF.
 Use the DIRTYSIS option to examine the anomalous pixel spectra.
 Try a multiple pass clean:
     Choose a PHA cut to optimize the S/N of the flickering pixels,
     then a broad band clean.
 Be suspicious of extended source cleans.
 For very bright sources you may need to turn off the iteration option.

 PROGRAM TO MAKE AN SIS SCIENCE FILE CLEANED OF ANOMALOUS PIXELS.
 
 * Anomalous pixels may consist of at least two populations.
 
 1. Persistent HOT pixels are removed by comparing to the chip mean.
 
 2. Flickering WARM pixels are removed by comparing to the cell mean.
 
 3. In faint areas (zero bgd), flickering pixels are removed with a
    cutoff threshold.
 
 Hints:
 Choose cell size and thresholds based on the expected background and the PSF.
 Use the DIRTYSIS option to examine the anomalous pixel spectra.
 Try a multiple pass clean:
     Choose a PHA cut to optimize the S/N of the flickering pixels,
     then a broad band clean.
 Be suspicious of extended source cleans.
 For very bright sources you may need to turn off the iteration option.
 
 See the help page for further info (fhelp cleansis)
