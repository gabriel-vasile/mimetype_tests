[Docket No. FAA-2004-18716; Directorate Identifier 2003-NM-240-AD]
RIN 2120-AA64

 
Airworthiness Directives; BAE Systems (Operations) Limited Model 
BAe 146 and Avro 146-RJ Series Airplanes

AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.

ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) 
for all BAE Systems (Operations) Limited Model BAe 146 and Avro 146-RJ 
series airplanes. This proposed AD would require repetitive external 
eddy current inspections of the forward fuselage skin to detect 
cracking due to fatigue, and repair if necessary. This proposed AD is 
prompted by evidence of cracking due to fatigue along the edges of the 
chemi-etched pockets in certain front fuselage canopy skin panels. We 
are proposing this AD to prevent reduced structural integrity of the 
airplane fuselage.

DATES: We must receive comments on this proposed AD by August 30, 2004.

ADDRESSES: Use one of the following addresses to submit comments on 
this proposed AD.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Docket Management System (DMS)

    The FAA has implemented new procedures for maintaining AD dockets 
electronically. As of May 17, 2004, new AD actions are posted on DMS 
and assigned a docket number. We track each action and assign a 
corresponding directorate identifier. The DMS AD docket number is in 
the form ``Docket No. FAA-2004-99999.'' The Transport Airplane 
Directorate identifier is in the form ``Directorate Identifier 2004-NM-
999-AD.'' Each DMS AD docket also lists the directorate identifier 
(``Old Docket Number'') as a cross-reference for searching purposes.

Discussion

    Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness 
authority for the United Kingdom, notified us that an unsafe condition 
may exist on all BAE Systems (Operations) Limited Model BAe 146 and 
Avro 146-RJ series airplanes. The CAA advises that evidence of cracking 
due to fatigue has been found along the edges of the chemi-etched 
pockets in certain front fuselage canopy skin panels. This condition, 
if not corrected, could result in reduced structural integrity of the 
airplane fuselage.

Relevant Service Information

    BAE Systems (Operations) Limited has issued Inspection Service 
Bulletin ISB.53-167, including Appendices 2 and 3, all dated June 27, 
2003. The ISB describes procedures for repetitive external eddy current 
inspections of certain front fuselage canopy skin

[[Page 45615]]

panels to detect cracking, and repair if necessary. Accomplishing the 
actions specified in the service information is intended to adequately 
address the unsafe condition. The CAA mandated the service information 
and issued British airworthiness directive 007-06-2003 to ensure the 
continued airworthiness of these airplanes in the United Kingdom.

FAA's Determination and Requirements of the Proposed AD

    These airplane models are manufactured in the United Kingdom and 
are type certificated for operation in the United States under the 
provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 
21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant 
to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA 
informed of the situation described above. We have examined the CAA's 
findings, evaluated all pertinent information, and determined that AD 
action is necessary for products of this type design that are 
certificated for operation in the United States.
    Therefore, we are proposing this AD, which would require repetitive 
external eddy current inspections of certain front fuselage canopy skin 
panels to detect cracking, and repair if necessary. The proposed AD 
would require you to use the service information described previously 
to perform these actions, except as discussed under ``Differences 
Between the Proposed AD and Referenced Service Bulletin.''

Differences Between the Proposed AD and Referenced Service Bulletin

    Although the referenced service bulletin describes procedures for 
submitting Appendix 1 of the service bulletin with inspection results 
to the manufacturer, this proposed AD would not require that action. We 
do not need this information from operators.
    The service bulletin specifies that you may perform repairs in 
accordance with the structural repair manual (SRM), or that you may 
contact the manufacturer for instructions on how to repair conditions 
outside the limits defined in the SRM, but this proposed AD would 
require you to repair those conditions using a method that we or the 
CAA (or its delegated agent) approve. In light of the type of repair 
that would be required to address the unsafe condition, and consistent 
with existing bilateral airworthiness agreements, we have determined 
that, for this proposed AD, a repair we or the CAA approve would be 
acceptable for compliance with this proposed AD.

Costs of Compliance

    This proposed AD would affect about 54 airplanes of U.S. registry. 
The proposed actions would take about 40 work hours per airplane, at an 
average labor rate of $65 per work hour. Based on these figures, the 
estimated cost of the proposed AD for U.S. operators is $140,400, or 
$2,600 per airplane, per inspection cycle.

Regulatory Findings

    We have determined that this proposed AD would not have federalism 
implications under Executive Order 13132. This proposed AD would not 
have a substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship 
between the national Government and the States, or on the distribution 
of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.
    For the reasons discussed above, I certify that the proposed 
regulation:
    1. Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 
12866;
    2. Is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies 
and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and
    3. Will not have a significant economic impact, positive or 
negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria 
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
    We prepared a regulatory evaluation of the estimated costs to 
comply with this proposed AD. See the ADDRESSES section for a location 
to examine the regulatory evaluation.
