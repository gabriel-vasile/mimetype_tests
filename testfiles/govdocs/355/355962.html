                UARS WEEKLY STATUS REPORT - 28 JAN 2000

********************************************************************

***********
SOLSTICE
***********

We continue to gather enough data to meet all the SOLSTICE science
objectives during this period of reduced tape recorder operations. 
SOLSTICE operates normally, collecting solar data on all available 
orbital tracking periods and stellar calibration observations whenever 
possible.

***********
SUSIM
***********

SUSIM continues to gather a minimum set of daily solar scans scheduled
for periods of predicted telemetry.

MPG
***********

Routine processing of instrument Daily Activity Plans continues  
with no problems.  The MPG continues to assist the Project 
Scientist with the scheduling of instrument operations. 

Various options for future Narrow Band Tape Recoder operations
are being explored, and the MPG is supporting these studies.

***********
CDHF
***********

The CDHF continues to closely monitor production jobs CPU and Wallclock 
usage and notify PI's of any discrepancies encountered in the processing as 
a result of the UARS Spacecraft Anomaly.
                        
The CDHF processed current day data through level 3 for all active
   instruments. Additionally, CDHF personnel reprocessed: (R)= Requested
   (C) = Complete, (F)= Failed  (L) = Days remaining to reprocess.
        33 days WIN (5.11A) PROD (L1-L3)         (520R-344C-13F=163L)       

DAAC DATA:
   -  DAAC data created in the month of November 1999 has been loaded into the
      DAAC Transfer Tables for HALOE, PEM, NMC, and UKMO. 
   -  The CDHF will load December 1999 current day DAAC data in February 2000.

                                    REPORTING PERIOD    

This report covers 15 January, 2000 (Orbit 45604, GMT Day 015) through 21 
January 2000 (Orbit 45708, GMT Day 021).


                                   SPACECRAFT OPERATION

The observatory is now in Reverse Flight (Northern Hemisphere viewing) and is 
performing nominally under two-battery operations.  The instrument operational 
changes were:

                               INSTRUMENT OPERATIONAL CHANGES

                     Instrument     Time       Orbit     Comment
                       PEM        015/0103     45605     AXIS-1 On
                      WINDII      017/0110     45635     On

The beta angle ranged between the angles of 30.7 degrees to 59.4 degrees for 
this report period.  The beta angle is now increasing toward a maximum angle of 
76.0 degrees on 27 January 1999 (DOY 027).

Spacecraft battery 1, 2, and 3 performance monitoring continues. Battery 1 
remains OFF the charge relay.  Battery 2 and Battery 3 are currently 
maintaining greater than 23.8 V end-of-night (EON) load bus voltage.  Battery 
temperatures are stable with a temperature delta between Battery 2 and Battery 
3 of 1.0 to 1.3 degrees C.  Additional battery performance data for each 
battery on 14 January 2000 and 21 January 2000 are provided in Appendix D.

The clock error ranged from 12.5 to -11.1 msec during this report period.  
Clock rate adjustments are listed in Appendix C.

All instrument and subsystem engineers were advised on the initial excursion of 
ALERTS or Out-Of-Limits conditions detected by the FOT for this report.  A 
summary is listed below and the details of ALERT and Out-Of-Limits occurrences 
are listed in Appendix B.

%     OUT-OF-LIMITS   =     06
%     ALERTS          =     00

The following real-time command sheets were executed for the listed operational 
element(s) during this report period (see Appendix A).

%     FOT             =     09
%     HALOE           =     01
%     PEM             =     01
%     WINDII          =     01

UARS Anomaly Reports initiated during this report period are listed in Appendix 
E and summarized below.

%     FOT             =     01

Three (3) Anomaly Reports remained OPEN at the end of this report period (see 
Appendix E).

TRANSPONDER FREQUENCIES:
7 Transponder A:  99/358  -  2287.496855
7 Transponder B:  99/365  -  2287.499111


                                 GROUND SYSTEM OPERATION

One (1) operational support problems occurred this period.  Anomaly Reports are 
included in Appendix E.

The data loss calculations supplied by Data Capture Facility (DCF) from mission 
start through UTC Day 00/020 show the observatory data loss to be 564 hours, 16 
minutes, 10.825 seconds (an increase of 01 hours 09 minutes 20.224 seconds 
since the last report period).

The increase of 01 hours 09 minutes 20.224 seconds occurred over six (5) days:

- 18 minutes 18.528 seconds on Day 014 due to an unspecified problem.
- 11 minutes 54.048 seconds on Day 015 due to an unspecified problem.
- 02 minutes 42.752 seconds on Day 016 due to an unspecified problem.
- 10 minutes 24.352 seconds on Day 019 due to an unspecified problem.
- 26 minutes 00.544 seconds on Day 020 due to an unspecified problem.

These calculations are under repair.  They are being recalculated from the date 
where PASS 2 operations were scheduled exclusively.

                                OTHER SIGNIFICANT EVENTS

                                UARS SATELLITE OPERATIONS

No significant satellite operations to report.


                                      MEETINGS

20 January, 2000 - The FOT attended a meeting to discuss the status of the tape 
recorder.  Three TDRSS operations were discussed in detail.  The FOT was given 
some action items that are to delivered by next weeks tape recorder anomaly 
meeting (January 26).


                              FUTURE SIGNIFICANT EVENTS

The next UARS Yaw slew is scheduled for February 15, 2000 (DOY 046).  This 
maneuver will be a Reverse to Forward Flight maneuver (Southern Hemisphere 
viewing).
