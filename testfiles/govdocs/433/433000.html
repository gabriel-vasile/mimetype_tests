shaping the destiny of your organization.</strong>  New York: American Management

Association, 1994. 213 pp. (Shelved at HD58.9.A447 1994).<br />

facing managers, in this part case-study book. The book follows three people's difficult business

decisions from confrontation through to the ramifications of the decisions. Badaracco examines

the managers' options from the point of view of philosophers and literary history.<br /><br />

</li><li>Batten, Joe D.  <strong>Tough-minded leadership.</strong>  New York: American

</li><li>Bemis, Warren and Burt Nanus.  <strong>Leaders: the strategies for taking

charge.</strong>  New York: Harper & Row, 1985. 244 pp.<br /> 

1/98 version: The authors discuss the &quot;transformative leadership&quot; of leaders who can shape and

elevate the motives and goals of followers, thereby achieving significant change reflecting the

community of interests of both leaders and followers, and freeing up the collective energies in

pursuit of a common goal. Transformative leaders understand the collective aspirations of their

followers, and are able to create institutions that can empower employees to satisfy those

needs.<br /><br />

</li><li>Bennis, Warren and Burt Manus.  <strong>Leaders: strategies for taking

change.</strong>  2nd revised ed. New York: Harper Business, 1997. 235 pp. (Shelved at

HD57.7.B46 1985).<br />

Leadership, according to the authors, is about judgment and character, and can best be handled

by integrated human beings. This book concentrates on four themes shared by leaders: 1) vision -

leaders with intensity and commitment whose attention is focusing on the goal and the agenda

express a magnetism which attracts followers; 2) communication - the tool for sharing meaning;

3) trust - whereby the leader's position offers security to followers; 4) deployment of self through

positive self-regard. Leaders are shown as setting direction, managing change concurrently with

the provision of high-quality service, and attracting new resources.<br /><br />

leadership guide to developing high performance in contemporary organizations.</strong> 

New York: John Wiley, 1997. (Shelved at HD31.B722 1997).<br />

Leadership is crucial, but less to provide answers than to build the conditions under which

subordinates can give their best. The authors offer three fundamental assumptions for developing

individuals: most people can change, learn, grow; influence between boss and subordinate can be

mutual; most managers can learn the necessary skills. Following a number of practical how-to

chapters, Bradford and Cohen offer seven steps for building beyond adequacy to

excellence.<br /><br />

leadership.</strong>  New York: American Management Association, 1992. 172 pp.<br /> 

1/98 version: According to the author, there are serious questions regarding privilege and

accountability underlying the mystique of leadership. He offers practical advice on how to bring

out the best in employees while bypassing the shallow seductions of power and cultivating your

order).<br />

This guide presents a strategic framework for identifying and developing future leaders in

organizations. According to the book, the real leaders of the future are those employees who have

the ability to learn from their experiences and remain open to continuous learning. Author McCall

explains how management can create an environment that supports talent development; he also

shows how individuals can take charge of their own development and avoid pitfalls that lead to

falling off the executive track.<br /><br />

</li><li>McMaster, Michael D.  <em>Organizational theory.</em> In <strong>The intelligence

advantage: organizing for complexity.</strong> , 43-105. Boston: Butterworth-Heinemann,

1996. (Shelved at HD31.M3856 1996).<br />

In this section, the basis for a new theory of organization based on complexity is developed. The

theory calls for freedom designed with an understanding of complex intelligent systems and their

self-organizing nature.  The process of breaking free begins with a leadership able to understand

the grip of the past, as well as grasp the nature of possiblity, and willing to lead by

example.<br /><br />

</li><li>McNamara, Carlton P.  <em>Organizational excellence.</em> <strong>Business &

Economic Review (University of South Carolina)</strong> 43, no.4 (July-September 1997):

19+. (Shelved at BPR216; accessible online at

<a href="/global-pages/exit.html?link=http://research.badm.sc.edu/research/bereview/be43_4/mcnamara.htm">http://research.badm.sc.edu/research/bereview/be43_4/mcnamara.htm</a>).<br />

This article asserts that, in order to be successful, organizations must establish a flexible but clear

strategic direction with a team-based organizational concept and supporting processes and

systems in place. They must also show a relentless commitment to the intangibles of leadership

style, human resource planning, company values. According to the author, the bottom line is that

organizational excellence demands a new leadership style. As a result of that leadership, the most

successful organizations create a special culture with a unique blend of values, beliefs, tools, and

language. This article offers a lot of good information illustrated with quotes from business

leaders; one from John F. Welch, CEO of GE, calls for an organization with the &quot;type of liberated,

involved, excited, boundary-less culture that is present in successful start-up enterprises&quot;. Isn't

that where we would all like to work?<br /><br />

</li><li>Scott, Michael P.  <em>Being centered, setting limits, and having fun.</em>

<strong>Association Management</strong> 49, no.3 (March 1997): 55+.<br />

It is possible for individuals to manage change and develop a greater sense of career focus in the

midst of this dynamic environment by examining three principles: 1) the principle of centeredness

which means that as a centered person you have a strong mission or purpose in life, values to help

you in your decisionmaking efforts, and a vision to steer your future; 2) the principle of limits

which means that you can't do everything, but must focus on what is important versus what is

urgent. Create a greater sense of balance to the physical, mental, social, and spiritual aspects of

your life; 3) the principle of fun, which means keeping life in its proper perspective by having

fun.<br /><br />

</li><li>Simons, Robert and Antonio Davila.  <em>How high is your return on management.</em>

<strong>Harvard Business Review</strong> (January-February 1998): 70-81.<br />

1/98 version: The classic business rations for measuring performance - return on equity, return on

assets, and return on sales, to name a few - may be useful. But none is designed specifically to

reflect how well a company implements its strategy. Enter return on management (ROM), a new

ration that gauges the payback from an organization's scarcest resource: managers' time and

energy. Unlike other business rations, ROM is a rough estimate, not an exact percentage. Still it is

expressed like other business ratios by an equation in which the output is maximized by a high

numerator and a low denominator: productive organizational energy released/management time

and attention invested. Knowing which organizational factors conspire against or work to

maximize an organization's productive energy will help managers calculate a rough measure for

this equation. The authors suggest that organizations look at five factors - referred to as the &quot;five

acid tests&quot; to approximate this measure: Do employees know which opportunities do not directly

contribute to the organization's strategic mission? Do managers know what it would take for the

organization to fail? Can managers recall their key diagnostic measures with relative ease? Is the

organization free from drowning in a sea of paperwork and processes? Do all employees watch

the same performance measures that their bosses watch? If a manager can answer yes to these

questions, ROM is probably high. If the answer is no to some, ROM may be low, signaling that

managers may need to step up their
