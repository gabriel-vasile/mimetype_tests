            <h3> Dilemmas of an Aging Society<br>
              Chapter 1</h3>
            <p>M</B>odern medical science has been an unrivaled benefactor of 
              humankind-providing cures for terrible diseases, palliative care 
              for the sick and suffering, and longer and healthier lives for the 
              vast majority of us. Most citizens in developed countries can now 
              expect to live into their seventies and eighties, with many living 
              into their nineties and beyond. Not only are people living longer, 
              but they are staying healthier longer, with a real chance to enjoy 
              their "golden years." Even some of the chronic disabilities of old 
              age are in decline,<sup><font size="2"><sup><a href="#_edn1">1</a></sup></font></sup> 
              as medical science and improved risk management continue to succeed 
              in extending the disability-free stage of the natural life span. 
              An ever-growing cohort of people enjoys today a period of true retirement, 
              when the obligations of work and raising children are past, when 
              body and mind remain in health, and when there's still time to pursue 
              or renew the avocations of life. </P>
            <P> Yet these great accomplishments have also brought new challenges. 
              No one, of course, would want to "turn the clock back," but the 
              problems accompanying medical progress are real as well as perplexing. 
              Consider that around the world-and especially in the United States 
              and other advanced industrial democracies-there is increasing concern 
              about the "graying of the population," the "aging of society," and 
              the "retirement of the baby boomers." This concern takes many forms-economic, 
              ethical, social, and civic-and it promises to loom large in our 
              private lives and public debates. Many of the questions center around 
              caregiving: Who will need it? Who will do it? Who will pay for it? 
              And perhaps most importantly, what kind of <I>care</I> is owed to 
              those at the end of life? </P>
            <P> When thinking about caregiving, we have concerns about pension 
              insecurity, rising costs of health care, shortages of available 
              caregivers, and the insufficient number of good nursing homes. We 
              have concerns about the potential neglect or abandonment of the 
              elderly, and the possibility of welcoming euthanasia or assisted 
              suicide as ways to "solve the problem" of lingering old age. Many 
              of us face decisions about forgoing careers in order to act as caregivers, 
              or spending less time with young children in order to care for aged 
              parents, or using funds set aside for a daughter's college tuition 
              in order to pay for a father's nursing home. In short, we worry 
              about whether we can afford to care, whether we will be willing 
              and able to care, and what we must sacrifice in order to care for 
              the elderly. And many of us in the middle of life, thinking about 
              growing older ourselves, fear the loss of our powers, the deprivations 
              and loneliness that often accompany old age, and the prospect of 
              being a burden on those we love most. </P>
            <P> Thus, while people are living healthier into old age and doing 
              so on a mass scale, there remain many difficulties, both psychic 
              and physical, that eventually come with growing old. Precisely because 
              people are living longer, many are living long enough to suffer 
              age-related degenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's-diseases 
              that involve long-term decline and thus the need for long-term care. 
              And precisely because many individuals have taken advantage of modern 
              freedom's opportunities for education, careers, and geographic mobility, 
              many elderly persons will live in greater isolation from loved ones, 
              separated from children and grandchildren who have settled elsewhere 
              or whose lives are defined primarily by work and school. Smaller 
              and less stable families will likely compound these problems, as 
              the burdens of caregiving fall on one or two adult children, who, 
              in many cases, are called upon to care for parents who did not always 
              care well for them. And many among the growing population of childless 
              elderly will have no relatives at all to look after them. Taken 
              together, the need for family caregivers will almost certainly increase 
              while the availability of family caregivers may only decline. And 
              the same difficult choices and trade-offs faced by individuals and 
              families will confront society as a whole: the needs and plight 
              of the elderly will only seem more urgent; the costs of medical 
              and long-term care will only increase; and the need to balance the 
              obligations of caregiving with other civic and human goods will 
              only seem more difficult, even as America becomes wealthier. </P>
            <P> Before these difficulties we are hardly resourceless. With our 
              science and medicine, we are working to combat the ailments and 
              limitations that aging brings, seeking to reduce or remove the disabilities 
              that longevity has until now brought with it. We also look to insurance 
              plans and public policies to make aging affordable and secure, whether 
              by increasing Medicare benefits or creating retirement savings accounts 
              or providing private long-term care insurance. And we use civil 
              rights law to battle against "age discrimination," to ensure that 
              old people are not treated as second-class citizens in employment. 
              All of these approaches and efforts are necessary and welcome. </P>
            <P> But they are also limited, and limited in principle. For senescence 
              is best understood not as a problem but as an inescapable <I>condition</I>-as 
              part of what it means to be human and to live in a human society. 
              Absent awareness of this fact, we will be tempted to believe that 
              medicine, social policy, economics, or law can solve the problems 
              of aging, or that technological and social progress can make the 
              dilemmas of growing old and approaching death less serious than 
              they always were and always will be. Or else, preferring denial, 
              we will be tempted to live as if we will be young forever, or as 
              if the elderly among us will take care of themselves, or as if the 
              seeming "pointlessness" of the end of life means that neglecting 
              the elderly is nothing to worry about. </P>
            <P> In the end, however, aging and dying-even with the progress we 
              can still reasonably expect from medicine and social change-will 
              not yield to either the genius of the manager or the utopian hopes 
              of those who pretend that, by change of attitude, old age is somehow 
              avoidable. Good public policy matters profoundly in this area, but 
              even the best policies will never make aging, caregiving, and dying 
              easy. As individuals and as a society, we will need deeper wisdom 
              and resources of character if we are going to age well in the years 
              ahead. We will need greater ethical reflection on what the young 
              owe the old, what the old owe the young, and what we all owe one 
              another. And we will need prudence in designing effective public 
              policies and in making loving decisions at the bedside, so that 
              we accept the limits of modern medicine and economic resources while 
              never abandoning conscientious and compassionate human care. </P>
            <P> The aim of this chapter is to contribute, in a concrete if necessarily 
              limited way, to our understanding of the social question of what 
              the "graying of the population" means for our society and the human 
              question of what aging and dementia tell us about ourselves, as 
              finite creatures in need of care. </P>
            <P> The chapter has three major parts: Starting from a social perspective, 
              we first present an overview of our aging society, looking at certain 
              demographic, medical, and sociological trends; we try to understand 
              what is novel about our current situation, and why we might be facing 
              a "crisis" in long-term care. Second, we look at individual aging, 
              to understand what it means to age well, what it means today to 
              grow up and grow old within the cycle of the generations. Finally, 
              we look at the special challenges and lived experiences of age-related 
              dementia, a debility that in the coming decades will only become 
              more common as people live regularly into their eighties and beyond. 
              Our purpose here is to diagnose the dilemmas now before us, so that 
              policymakers and civic leaders can seek to ameliorate some of the 
              problems ahead and avoid the worst kinds of miseries and abuses. 
              But by reflecting on the character of aging itself, including those 
              aspects that cannot be "solved" but simply confronted and endured, 
              we also want to insist that there is an inescapable need for care 
              and caregiving, to be offered with as much equanimity, virtue, and 
              mutual support as individuals, families, and communities can muster.</P>

            <P> How we care for the dependent elderly will test whether modern 
              life has not only made things better for us but also made us better 
              human beings, more willing to accept the obligations to care and 
              more able to cope with the burdens of caregiving. Put simply: Can 
              a society that values self-reliance, personal freedom, and careerism 
              reconcile itself to the realities of dependence, diminished autonomy, 
              and responsibility for others? To consider this broad question, 
              we must first examine some sociological and demographic facts. </P>
            <em><strong> A. The Aging Society</strong></em> <P> In the years ahead, 
              the age structure of most advanced industrial societies will be 
              unlike anything previously seen in human history, with both the 
              average age of the population and the absolute number of old people 
              increasing dramatically. To think responsibly about the social and 
              ethical challenges of aging and caregiving, we need some sense of 
              this new demographic picture and what it will mean for crucial social 
              institutions and ordinary families. Although our focus is on the 
              United States, these same trends are visible-and often even more 
              dramatic-in Europe and Japan. </P>
            <P> Because demography employs a series of classifications, we need 
              first to examine how we tend to classify people as "old." In America, 
              we still look to age 65 as the cut-off between middle age and old 
              age, between work and retirement, between income and pensions, between 
              private health insurance and public health care. The place of 65 
              in the public imagination and in public policy is, however, largely 
              a social construct. The designation of 65 as the age of retirement 
              deserving of social support traces back to a decision by the 19<SUP>th</SUP>-century 
              Prussian statesman Otto von Bismarck, who thought it unlikely that 
              many people would live beyond this age to become burdens on the 
              state. Our own national system of social security, put in place 
              in 1935, adopted the same age, also with little expectation of many 
              people living much beyond this point. </P>
            <P> Today, as we are all well aware, the situation is quite different, 
              and our understanding of what it means to be "old" has become more 
              nuanced. There are the "young old," who despite having reached the 
              official retirement age of 65 continue to live vigorous and productive 
              lives. Then there are the "old old," who have perhaps begun to slow 
              down but still lead lives of relative health and activity. And, 
              finally, we now speak also of the "oldest old," or those who are 
              85 years and over, a group that tends to be mainly or wholly dependent 
              for their care on others. These new labels and terms are, moreover, 
              less about chronological age per se than about a person's bodily 
              and psychological condition. A 65-year-old might be either among 
              the "young old" in his well being and activity levels or, because 
              of the afflictions of disease, already in experiential terms among 
              the "oldest old." </P>
            <P> Whatever its limitations, however, the magic number of 65 still 
              provides a window of understanding into what's new about our condition. 
              Life at 65 today is often different from what it was a century or 
              half-century ago. For one thing, living to 65 and beyond is now 
              commonplace, when in the past it was a rare occurrence. During the 
              last century, the average American life expectancy at birth rose 
              from 47 years in 1900 to 77 years and climbing in 2000.<sup><font size="2"><sup><a href="#_edn2">2</a></sup></font></sup> 
              According to a study published in 2000, 78 percent of Americans 
              live past their 65th birthday;<sup><font size="2"><sup><a href="#_edn3">3</a></sup></font></sup> 
              and this figure is rising, from 69 percent for those born in 1925 
              to an estimated 80 percent for those born in 1955.<sup><font size="2"><sup><a href="#_edn4">4</a></sup></font></sup> 
              Moreover, living at65 and beyond is usually a much different experience 
              than it used to be. There is a much greater likelihood of being 
              relatively healthy, with major and potentially deadly diseases (like 
              heart disease or kidney disease) under better control and chronic 
              ailments (like arthritis or orthopedic problems) better managed 
              through pain-relieving medication or joint-replacement surgery. 
              We know much more about what it takes to stay healthier longer, 
              and many people have the good fortune and good sense to take advantage 
              of this knowledge. </P>
            <P> But if the "young-old" are younger than their predecessors, the 
              "old-old" and the "oldest old" often pay the delayed price of healthier 
              longevity. A very significant and growing number of people suffer 
              (or will suffer) years of enfeeblement, disability, and dementia, 
              eventually incapable of caring for their own elementary needs. As 
              we take stock of the changing demography of American society, therefore, 
              we need to keep both these dimensions of aging in mind: the unchanging 
              and unavoidable decline that comes with old age and the fact that 
              being old today usually does not mean utter debility. <I>The defining 
              characteristic of our time seems to be that we are both younger 
              longer and older longer</I>; we are more vigorous at ages that once 
              seemed very old and we are far more likely to suffer protracted 
              periods of age-related disability and dependence because we live 
              to ages that few people reached in the past.<font size="2"><sup><a href="#_ftn1">i</a></sup></font></P>
            <P> However one defines "old age," there is no question that the age 
              structure of American society is changing, the result of increasing 
              longevity, lower birthrates, and the special anomaly known as the 
              "baby boom"-the great increase in the birth rate between 1946 and 
              1964 that has produced an unusually large cohort of Americans now 
              between the ages of 40 and 60. These factors guarantee that the 
              dramatic shifts in age structure seen in the twentieth century will 
              continue through at least the middle of the twenty-first century. 
              In the year 1900, there were 3.1 million Americans over the age 
              of 65 (or 4.1 percent of the population). By mid-century, there 
              were 12.3 million people over 65 (or 8.1 percent of the population). 
              In 2000, 35.0 million people were over 65 (or 12.4 percent of the 
              population), a number that is projected to rise to 71.5 million 
              by 2030 (or 19.6 percent of the population) when the youngest baby-boomers 
              have passed age 65.<sup><font size="2"><sup><a href="#_edn5">5</a></sup></font></sup> 
              The rising average and median ages in the population are due also 
              to fewer births. Not only are the baby boomers aging, but they had 
              fewer children than their parents, and at present the American birthrate 
              remains low by historic standards (though it is significantly higher 
              than most of Europe and Japan and modestly higher than it was in 
              America in the 1970s and 1980s.) </P>
            <P> Moreover, and perhaps more significant for the subject of long-term 
              caregiving, the oldest of the old (people age 85 or older) are currently 
              the fastest growing segment of the population. In 2004, according 
              to estimates by the U.S. Census Bureau, an estimated 4.9 million 
              Americans were age 85 or older.<sup><font size="2"><sup><a href="#_edn6">6</a></sup></font></sup> 
              That number is expected to increase to 6.1 million by 2010 and to 
              9.6 million by 2030.<sup><font size="2"><sup><a href="#_edn7">7</a></sup></font></sup> 
              Over a somewhat longer term, the trends are even more startling: 
              Between 2000 and 2050, the U. S. Census Bureau expects the population 
              of Americans age 45 to 54 to grow moderately from 37 million to 
              43 million; but, in the same period, the population age 55 to 64 
              will grow from 24 million to 42 million; the population age 65 to 
              74 will nearly <I>double</I>, from 18 million to 35 million; the 
              population age 75 to 84 will more than double, from 12 million to 
              26 million; and the population age 85 and above will <I>more than</I> 
              <I>quadruple</I>, from 4 million to 18 million.<sup><font size="2"><sup><a href="#_edn8">8</a></sup></font></sup>

            <P> At present, roughly one third of Americans will live to age 85 
              and beyond, and that fraction is likely only to increase. Yet this 
              greater longevity comes with many greater burdens. After age 85, 
              only one person in twenty is still fully mobile; and roughly half 
              the people over 85 will suffer major cognitive impairment or dementia 
              as part of their final phase of life. At present, according to the 
              Alzheimer's Association, an estimated 4.5 million Americans have 
              Alzheimer's disease; by 2050, the number of Americans with Alzheimer's 
              disease is estimated to range between 11 million and 16 million<sup><font size="2"><sup><a href="#_edn9">9</a></sup></font></sup>-unless 
              a cure or prevention can be found soon enough to change this grim 
              forecast. (We will be discussing such medical efforts, which are 
              not without hope of success, below.)<font size="2"><sup><a href="#_ftn2">ii</a></sup></font> 
            </P>
            <P> This changing age structure will obviously have significant economic, 
              social, and political effects-though what they are cannot be fully 
              predicted in advance. The mass geriatric society will test the adequacy 
              of our caregiving institutions (such as nursing homes) and the solvency 
              of our caregiving programs (such as Medicare). We can hardly do 
              justice to this complicated set of social and policy questions here, 
              but a few salient facts seem worth noting, just to paint a picture 
              of some of the changes and developments that we can expect in the 
              years ahead:</P>
            <ul>
              <li> In 2000, only one state (Florida) had a population with at 
                least 17 percent of the population aged 65 and older. By 2030, 
                44 states will have populations with at least 17 percent of the 
                population aged 65 or older.<sup><font size="2"><sup><a href="#_edn10">10</a></sup></font></sup> 
              </li>
              <li> According to a recent estimate, 35 percent of the annual federal 
                budget goes to programs benefiting older persons. If these programs 
                continue unchanged, this percentage will only increase.<sup><font size="2"><sup><a href="#_edn11">11</a></sup></font></sup> 
              </li>
              <li> By the year 2020, it is estimated that nearly 157 million Americans 
                will have some form of chronic illness, up from 125 million in 
                2000.<sup><font size="2"><sup><a href="#_edn12">12</a></sup></font></sup> 
              </li>
              <li> The estimated cost of Alzheimer's disease to Medicare and Medicaid 
                totaled $50 billion in 2000 and is projected to be $72 billion 
                in 2010.<sup><font size="2"><sup><a href="#_edn13">13i</a></sup></font></sup> 
              </li>
            </ul>
            <P> In a society with more elderly citizens and fewer younger workers, 
              these changes will put ever-greater strain on programs like Medicare, 
              Medicaid, and Social Security. When Medicare was introduced in the 
              1960s, only 9 percent (seventeen million) of the population was 
              65 or older, and only 0.5 percent (one million) was older than age 
              85. By the time the baby-boom generation starts turning 85 in about 
              2030, Medicare-as it is now constituted-would be paying for the 
              care of an estimated 80 million Americans (22 percent of the population), 
              including 9 million people who are 85 and older, nearly all of them 
              with expensive health care needs. According to projections assuming 
              a "middle costs" scenario, Medicare will grow from 2.4 percent of 
              GDP today to 8.3 percent in 2050; and Medicare, Medicaid, and Social 
              Security will nearly double as a share of the nation's economy by 
              2035. Moreover, the desire to expand these programs and to add new 
              benefits will only become more powerful just as the capacity to 
              pay for them is tested. </P>
            <P> One of the greatest economic and social challenges will be funding 
              long-term care-the provision of daily medical and personal assistance 
              to individuals incapable of looking after themselves, ranging from 
              in-home nurses to adult day-care services to full-time nursing homes. 
              These services will grow more necessary in the years ahead and probably 
              more costly, but they are not at present covered under Medicare. 
              Medicaid pays a large percentage of the costs of long-term care 
              for the poor; arguably, it has become in large measure a de facto 
              long-term care program, as many middle-class people spend down their 
              assets or shift them to relatives in order to become eligible for 
              Medicaid. As a result, the strains on the system are already great, 
              and getting worse. As physician and long-term care specialist Joanne 
              Lynn points out: "The services needed during the last few years 
              of life are expensive. In fiscal year 2000, Medicaid paid for 45 
              percent of the $137 billion annual cost of institutional long-term 
              care. The Congressional Budget Office forecasts that the cost of 
              long-term care, roughly $123 billion in 2000, will reach $207 billion 
              in 2020 and $346 billion in 2040. These extraordinary costs risk 
              bankrupting state budgets, which currently devote 20 percent of 
              expenditures to Medicaid."<sup><font size="2"><sup><a href="#_edn11">14</a></sup></font></sup> 
              One likely response to these rising Medicaid costs will be demands 
              to include long-term care coverage as part of Medicare, especially 
              as middle-class persons are squeezed between providing for their 
              parents and their children and forced either to forgo work to care 
              for their elders at home or to pay the rising costs of professional 
              or institutional care. This creation of a long-term care benefit 
              would likely make Medicare's existing solvency problems far worse. 
            </P>
            <P> The effects of America's changing age structure are not limited 
              to the pension or health care systems, important as these are. The 
              coming of the mass geriatric society will affect every dimension 
              of human and social life: the culture of the workplace, the consumer 
              market, the housing market, and, most deeply, the rhythm and character 
              of family life. We will live differently, work differently, and 
              perhaps even think differently in a society in which the needs of 
              the old become ever more dominant. Our politics might change as 
              well, especially if older people increasingly vote their class interests 
              as elderly; in the extreme, there is the unwholesome possibility 
              of a "war between the generations," as people insist on securing 
              their own advantage with little regard for the intergenerational 
              common good and with no organized voice to speak up for the rising 
              generations. </P>
            <P> These broad social changes in how we live will be accompanied 
              by radically new patterns in the end of life. New trajectories of 
              illness and death will likely predominate in the coming decades, 
              and new questions will arise about who will care for those suffering 
              from chronic disabilities. If we are to understand what it means 
              to live in an aging society, we must take up these two crucial issues-namely, 
              <I>how we die</I> and <I>who</I> <I>will care</I>. </P>
            <em><strong> B. The Trajectory of Chronic Illness and Death</strong></em> 
            <P> In addition to radical changes in the overall age structure of 
              society, a growing percentage of the elderly are living through 
              longer periods of dependence and disability, including, and especially, 
              long periods of dementia. This rise in long-term disability and 
              dependence is, as already noted, the unintended consequence of our 
              success in preventing, curing, or managing the earlier and more 
              acute causes of death that once predominated. But there is more. 
              These advances have also changed the trajectory of chronic illness 
              and-most important-altered the leading causes of death. Because 
              we live longer, we die differently; and because medicine can better 
              confront the illnesses that would kill us quickly, we are far more 
              likely to die after a period of protracted physical disability and 
              cognitive impairment. </P>
            <P> In 1900, the usual place of death was at home; in 2000, it was 
              the hospital. In 1900, most people died from accidents or infections 
              without suffering a long period of disability. In 2000, people suffered, 
              on average, two years of severe disability on the way to death. 
              Acute causes of death (such as pneumonia, influenza, and septicemia) 
              are in decline; prolonged causes of death from age-related degenerative 
              diseases (such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and emphysema) are on 
              the rise. Already today, as Joanne Lynn points out, "Most Americans 
              die with failure of a major organ (heart, lungs, kidneys, or liver), 
              dementia, stroke, or general frailty of old age. . . . [T]hese conditions 
              lead to long periods of diminished function and involve multiple 
              unpredictable and serious exacerbations of symptoms."<sup><font size="2"><sup><a href="#_edn15">15</a></sup></font></sup> 
              Living longer also means suffering numerous chronic but not deadly 
              conditions-such as arthritis, hearing and vision loss, dental decay, 
              bowel problems, and urinary difficulties. Frailty becomes both more 
              extended and more commonplace, which means that "the body's systems 
              have little reserve and small upsets cause cascading health problems."<sup><font size="2"><sup><a href="#_edn16">16</a></sup></font></sup> 
            </P>
            <P> A 2003 study by researchers at the Rand Corporation sought to 
              explain, organize, and quantify the various "trajectories of chronic 
              illness," in an effort to describe how the character of aging and 
              dying has changed dramatically over the last many decades and to 
              show how unequipped we are for the caregiving challenges ahead. 
              To envision the caregiving needs of elderly people who are sick 
              enough to die, the study classified them into the three most common 
              groups, using the trajectory of decline over time that is characteristic 
              of the major type of disease or disability. </P>
            <P> The first group dies after a <I>short period of evident decline</I>; 
              this is the typical course of death from cancer. Many malignancies 
              are, of course, curable by surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. 
              And even many people who will die of cancer may be comfortable and 
              function well for a substantial period, until the illness becomes 
              overwhelming. Thereafter, the patient's status deteriorates rapidly, 
              especially in the final weeks and days before death. Death usually 
              occurs within a year. <I>Roughly 20 percent of all deaths are now 
              of this type</I>. </P>
            <P> The second group dies following <I>several years of increasing 
              physical limitations</I>, punctuated by intermittent acute life-threatening 
              episodes requiring hospitalization and vigorous intervention; this 
              is the typical course of death from chronic cardiac or respiratory 
              failure (for example, coronary artery disease or emphysema). Many 
              of these patients are at first little handicapped in daily life. 
              But as the disease progresses, "from time to time, some physiological 
              stress overwhelms the body's reserves and leads to a worsening of 
              serious symptoms. Patients survive a few such episodes but then 
              die from a complication or exacerbation, often rather suddenly."<sup><font size="2"><sup><a href="#_edn17">17</a></sup></font></sup> 
              <I>Roughly 20 percent of all deaths are now of this type</I>. </P>
            <P> The third-and already the largest-group dies only after <I>prolonged 
              dwindling, usually lasting many years</I>; this is the typical course 
              of death from dementia (including Alzheimer's disease or disabling 
              stroke) or generalized frailty of multiple body systems. This trajectory 
              toward death is gradual but unrelenting, with steady decline, enfeeblement, 
              and growing dependency, often lasting a decade or longer. In the 
              end, an overwhelming infection, a stroke, or some other insult that 
              a severely weakened body cannot handle becomes the proximate cause 
              of death. <I>Roughly 40 percent of all deaths are now of this type</I>.<font size="2"><sup><a href="#_ftn3">iii</a></sup></font>

            <P> The Rand study highlights the single most dramatic and socially 
              significant change in how we Americans die: four in ten of us die 
              only after an extended period of worsening debility, dementia, and 
              dependence. To be sure, most people over 65 at any given time are 
              still healthy. But as the cohort ages further, hundreds of thousands 
              slip into protracted dotage and feebleness, needing protracted long-term 
              care. And virtually every American family will be affected-indeed, 
              is already affected. </P>
            <P> Consider this implication. Every married couple, each with two 
              still living parents, may expect to be involved with or even fully 
              responsible for the care of at least one and, more likely, two of 
              these four parents who will live out their last five to ten years 
              in an increasingly enfeebled or demented condition, incapable of 
              looking after themselves.<font size="2"><sup><a href="#_ftn4">iv</a></sup></font> 
              And, because there is no reversing the disability, the better they 
              are cared for, the longer they will be in need of yet more expansive 
              (and often expensive) care. Later in life, close to half of these 
              caregiving children will themselves be in need of similar long-term 
              care. </P>
            <P> </P>
            <em><strong>C. The Availability of Caregivers</strong></em> <P> Dependence 
              means being dependent on others-on family members, professional 
              caregivers, and caregiving institutions. One's level of debility 
              shapes one's level of dependence: Some people require assistance 
              with only the most physically or mentally demanding tasks-like cleaning 
              the house or managing investments. Others require help with daily 
              activities-like preparing meals and paying bills. But those with 
              advanced dementia and grave physical illness require assistance 
              with the most basic activities of daily life-bathing, toileting, 
              dressing, and staying safe. Of course, those who suffer "prolonged 
              dwindling" progress through these stages of increasing dependence. 
              And this raises a major social question: As the incidence of dementia 
              and debility increase in the years ahead, who will provide such 
              caregiving for those who need it? And what burdens-economic and 
              personal-will such caregiving impose on caregiving individuals and 
              on society as a whole?</P>
            <P> <I>1. The Present Realities of Caregiving.</I><font size="2"><sup><a href="#_ftn5">v</a></sup></font></P>
            <P> Until now, unpaid family caregivers have supplied the bulk of 
              long-term care. In a national survey conducted in 2000, more than 
              a quarter of adult Americans reported that they had provided care 
              for disabled family members during the past year; that translates 
              into more than 50 million volunteer caregivers.<sup><font size="2"><sup><a href="#_edn18">18</a></sup></font></sup> 
              The federal Administration on Aging estimated that over 22 million 
              Americans are providing such care at any one time.<sup><font size="2"><sup><a href="#_edn19">19</a></sup></font></sup> 
            </P>
            <P> Within families, the practice of caregiving varies, but the responsibility 
              falls mainly on women:</P>
            <blockquote> 
              <p> For married elders, the first one to develop an eventually fatal 
                chronic illness can usually rely on the spouse for most of the 
                direct care needed. In a study of all caregivers assisting people 
                age sixty-five and older, spouses accounted for 24 percent, daughters 
                for 20 percent, and sons for 6 percent, meaning that immediate 
                family members are 50 percent of all caregivers. The onset of 
                illness in the caregiving spouse or in a widowed or unmarried 
                elder often precipitates a crisis for the rest of the family, 
                especially for daughters and daughters-in-law, who most often 
                assume the role of caregiver.<sup><font size="2"><sup><a href="#_edn21">20</a></sup></font></sup></p>
            </blockquote>
            <P> According to a 1999 study, the average length of time spent on 
              family caregiving was eight years, with a third of respondents providing 
              care for ten years or more.<sup><font size="2"><sup><a href="#_edn21">21</a></sup></font></sup> 
              Most family caregivers serve out of love and loyalty, and most of 
              them find caregiving meaningful and rewarding. </P>
            <P> But the challenges for family caregiving are increasingly weighty, 
              and the availability of unpaid family caregivers is diminishing, 
              in part because greater opportunities for women in the work force 
              leave fewer people free for volunteer caregiving, and in part because 
              of smaller family size and higher divorce rates. Single elderly 
              individuals often have to rely on paid care, and even when children 
              can provide some care, they often find they need additional paid 
              help. The average caregiving load is eighteen hours of direct services 
              per week; for those who care for persons needing assistance with 
              two or more activities of daily living (moving around, toileting, 
              feeding and dressing), the average rises to forty hours per week. 
              Yet most family caregivers also hold paying jobs, and the demands 
              of caregiving compel most of them to rearrange their schedules, 
              work fewer hours, or take unpaid leaves of absence. In addition, 
              caregiving work can and does cause health problems for the caregivers.<sup><font size="2"><sup><a href="#_edn22">22</a></sup></font></sup> 
              The average unpaid family caregiver is 60 years old, and many already 
              have chronic illnesses of their own.</P>
            <P> <I>2. The Future Availability of Caregivers</I>.</P>
            <P> In her recent book, Lynn cites a number of reasons why caregiving 
              for the elderly is so much more challenging today than it was in 
              the past, and why those challenges are likely to grow even more 
              daunting in the future. </P>
            <P> First, medical advances have enabled elderly and frail patients 
              to survive much longer with serious chronic illness and disability 
              than they could in the past. The patient's frailty, and the presence 
              of multiple illnesses and disabilities, may necessitate many different 
              kinds of care, including medication, cleaning, feeding, doctor's 
              visits, trips to the hospital, physical therapy, etc. The caregiver's 
              responsibility to provide some of these services and to supervise 
              others may last for years. Future medical advances are likely to 
              enable elderly patients to live even longer with an even greater 
              variety of chronic illnesses and disabilities. </P>
            <P> Second, families are smaller now, so that elderly patients on 
              average have fewer descendants to rely on for care. In the past, 
              there were few surviving grandparents, and they lived in large extended 
              families with many potential caregivers. Now the ratios are changing, 
              and an increasing percentage of the disabled elderly find themselves 
              without any living relatives: it is estimated that, by 2020, 1.2 
              million people aged 65 or older will have no living children, siblings, 
              or spouse.<sup><font size="2"><sup><a href="#_edn23">23</a></sup></font></sup> 
              The Institute for Health and Aging reports that, in 1990, for each 
              person over 85 years old, there were 21 people between the ages 
              of 50 and 64, the prime years for family caregiving; in 2030, for 
              each person over 85 years old, there will only be 6 people between 
              50 and 64.<sup><font size="2"><sup><a href="#_edn24">24</a></sup></font></sup> 
            </P>
            <P> Third, in the past, the typical family caregiver was a woman who 
              did not work outside the home, young enough to be able to care for 
              a sick parent alongside her own children; and the typical elderly 
              patient did not live very long with serious disability. Today's-and 
              tomorrow's-caregivers will typically have jobs outside the home, 
              unless they are ill or disabled themselves. Such working family 
              caregivers often have to give up years of income, or accept less 
              pay or advancement, in order to care for their elderly family members 
              for extended periods. Caring for elderly relatives will often come 
              into competition with raising a family of one's own; already, women 
              spend as long in caregiving for adult family members as in caring 
              for children.<sup><font size="2"><sup><a href="#_edn25">25</a></sup></font></sup> 
              In addition, because the elderly infirm are living longer, the potential 
              caregivers among their next of kin (especially spouses and children) 
              are likely to be older themselves, and hence more prone to illness 
              and less capable of the hard work required by care of the elderly. 
              All these factors make family care of the elderly more costly, more 
              challenging, and more burdensome to those providing the care. </P>
            <P> Fourth, it does not seem likely that an increase in <I>paid</I> 
              caregiving will be able to alleviate the growing strains on family 
              caregivers. To begin with, there is an ever-shrinking pool of workers 
              available for paid home health care. Home-care nursing used to be 
              an important opportunity for steady employment among women who lacked 
              advanced education and other skills, and especially among immigrants. 
              But several factors have combined to reduce the availability of 
              home-care aides and nurses, including the strenuousness of the work 
              involved, compensation barely above minimum wage, difficult relationships 
              with patients, language barriers, the lack of health insurance and 
              other benefits, and hindrances to immigration. To reverse this trend, 
              concerted efforts will be required to improve the working conditions, 
              wages, and advancement opportunities of paid home-care providers. 
              Without such costly improvements, we are likely to see a serious 
              shortage of paid care workers even as the supply of unpaid family 
              care-providers shrinks (for the reasons we have cited). Penny Hollander 
              Feldman estimates that by 2010, when the baby boomers begin to reach 
              old age, the pool of middle-aged women able and willing to provide 
              basic elder care services, whether in nursing homes or at home, 
              will be substantially smaller than it is now.<sup><font size="2"><sup><a href="#_edn26">26</a></sup></font></sup> 
              In addition, an ongoing shortage of trained nurses is likely to 
              be exacerbated in the future; the number of U.S.-educated nursing 
              school graduates who took the licensing examination for registered 
              nurses fell by 25 percent between 1995 and 2002,<sup><font size="2"><sup><a href="#_edn27">27</a></sup></font></sup> 
              and 75 percent of all hospitals already have vacancies for nurses.<sup><font size="2"><sup><a href="#_edn28">28</a></sup></font></sup> 
              It would be a tragic irony if our greater opportunities for individualistic 
              success have produced a world more in need of caregivers than ever, 
              but one that has lost its way of generating them.</P>
            <P CLASS="c4"> <em>3. A Caregiving Crisis?</em></P>
            <P> There is always a danger of declaring a social crisis prematurely, 
              especially in the face of many unknowns. Indeed, as we think about 
              the socio-economic dimensions of the challenge of caregiving, we 
              cannot ignore the fact that we are, as a society, much wealthier 
              than previous generations, with some reason to believe that the 
              generations that follow will be wealthier still. It may be that 
              changed patterns of saving and investment, new instruments such 
              as long-term care insurance, higher birthrates, increased immigration 
              of younger workers, and medical advances to prevent or treat these 
              chronic illnesses will make some of our current worries overwrought. 
              Just as it is foolish to ignore foreseeable problems, it is foolish 
              to assume that we can foresee everything. Free societies are also 
              creative societies, with a capacity to adapt to, as well as overcome, 
              hard and novel circumstances. </P>
            <P> But all that said, there <I>is</I> reason to think that a genuine 
              caregiving crisis may be looming, not only for the least well off 
              members of society but for those in the middle and upper classes 
              as well. Three unprecedented trends are about to converge, potentially 
              creating great stress on our systems of care. First, the age structure 
              in America is shifting, such that both in absolute and percentage 
              terms we are becoming a population of senior citizens. Second, although 
              many of us stay healthier longer, and this is a great blessing, 
              it is also the case that many of us will experience a lengthening 
              twilight of disability and dwindling. Today, as never seen before, 
              a vast majority of us will suffer a long period, as much as a decade, 
              of chronic illness and dependency before death comes. And finally, 
              just as these two trends create an increasing demand for good health 
              care providers, the actual supply of available caregivers appears 
              to be shrinking rapidly. Taken together these trends suggest an 
              impending public policy or socio-economic crisis in providing long-term 
              care for an expanding population of increasingly incapacitated seniors.<font size="2"><sup><a href="#_ftn6">vi</a></sup></font> 
            </P>
            <P> Confronting this grave social challenge will test us not only 
              as citizens and policymakers, but as individuals and families. It 
              will challenge us not only economically, but humanly and morally. 
              It will test our character and self-understanding, requiring us 
              to set aside self-interest in order to care for those who can no 
              longer provide for themselves. </P>
            <P> But if we are to confront well the challenges of long-term care, 
              we need also to attend to the human and ethical significance of 
              aging itself. To begin with, we should resist all notions of "solving" 
              the "problem of aging" and avoid acting as if aging is simply a 
              problem to be solved. Aging is part of human life, and aging well 
              requires the search for wisdom about what it means to ripen and 
              die. It requires the cultivation of the character necessary to endure 
              one's own decline. It requires a richer understanding of the lifecycle-seeing 
              oneself, as one ages, in relation to the young, and seeing death 
              in relation to the renewal of human possibility from generation 
              to generation. </P>
            <P> To think about the aging society, therefore, we must also think 
              about what it means to be an <I>aging person</I>: What shapes the 
              individual experience of growing old, and how does this experience 
              change from person to person, culture to culture, society to society? 
              For only by having some idea of what it means to age well and to 
              stay human in time do we have a compass to guide us as we face our 
              own potential crisis, as well as some way to measure whether we 
              have indeed averted the worst possible outcomes of aging badly.</P>
            <h3> II. Individual Aging and the Lifecycle</h3>
            <P> Aging is at once a biological, psychological, and social phenomenon. 
              It is a universal feature of human life. We grow, we grow up, we 
              grow older, and-if we are lucky-we grow old. In the broadest sense, 
              we are aging from the moment of birth until the moment of death. 
              In the <I>beginning</I> of life, to age means to develop-our bodies 
              grow larger, our mental capacities expand, our physical powers develop. 
              We learn to crawl, walk, run, speak, and write. In the long <I>middle</I> 
              of life, aging means developing and declining all at once-developing 
              new faculties and new perspectives but also gradually losing some 
              abilities that once came easily. For many, growth amid decline is 
              possible until the very end; the aging individual is still gaining 
              in wisdom and experience even as the body enters its final senescence. 
              But for others, at the <I>end</I> of life, biological aging eventually 
              means almost entirely loss and decline; it means the gradual or 
              swift eradication of one's physical and mental powers. In some cases, 
              the body declines in advance of the mind; in other cases, the mind 
              deteriorates in advance of the body. But in the end, for everyone, 
              aging leads to death and, with it, the loss of the whole person 
              as body-and-mind. This fact of being human and thus mortal is unavoidable 
              for everyone. </P>
            <P> Biological aging is not unique to human beings. All animals grow 
              and die, and the capacity for growth seems intertwined with the 
              reality of death. But for human beings, aging is not only a biological 
              experience but a psychological, existential, social, and religious 
              one: it involves seeing oneself in a new light as one's life progresses 
              and one's body changes; it involves looking back on one's past experiences 
              and looking ahead to one's shortening future; it involves treasuring 
              life and independence as long as possible and accepting dependence 
              and death when they can no longer be resisted. It involves changes 
              of familial and social roles, changes of responsibility at work 
              and at home, and differing forms of participation in civic and communal 
              life. </P>
            <P> Today, we have many images of being old-some perennial and some 
              unique to our time. There is the revered matriarch who commands 
              the respect of her entire family; the immobile and lonely resident 
              of a nursing home; the old man who gives youngsters a run for their 
              money on the tennis court; the doting grandmother who gives her 
              grandchildren sweets when their parents aren't looking; the senior 
              executive given "early retirement" by his younger and more ambitious 
              colleagues; the elder statesman who advises those who now stand 
              where she once stood; the demented elder statesman who no longer 
              knows his own name. Old age comes with many faces, and our image 
              of old age varies almost as much as the elderly persons we know 
              most intimately. Sometimes we revere the old and sometimes we pity 
              them. Sometimes we admire the timeless lessons they have to teach 
              us and sometimes we belittle them for not adapting to the times. 
            </P>
            <P> The two most prominent images of aging today stand in deep opposition 
              to one another: there is the idealized image of <I>healthy old age</I>, 
              with vigor and vitality until the end, and there is the sorrowful 
              image of <I>extended decline and dependence</I>, with the ravages 
              of long-term dementia and physical deterioration. Ours is the age 
              of both extended youth and extended degeneration-and often, for 
              many individuals, a life trajectory that is marked by one after 
              the other. <I>We are younger longer and we are aged longer. Living 
              well with this paradox of modern aging is perhaps the special challenge 
              of our time.</I> </P>
            <P> Aging well is thus a deeply ethical activity. It does not simply 
              mean having the good fortune of staying healthy and vigorous until 
              the end, but requires exhibiting certain virtues for as long as 
              one has the capacity to do so. As William F. May reflects in his 
              seminal essay on the ethical life of the elderly:</P>
            <blockquote> 
              <p> Such virtues do not come automatically with growing old. Even 
                limited dealings with the elderly disabuse us of that sentimentality. 
                Rather, the virtues grow only through resolution, struggle, perhaps 
                prayer, and perseverance. Further, these virtues hardly appear 
                only in the elderly. Some common human virtues-which men and women 
                of all ages might do well to cultivate-simply take special form 
                in the later years. When they do appear in the elderly, however, 
                they can instruct and sometimes even inspire. Their example can 
                encourage particularly the fainthearted among the young who believe 
                that full human existence is possible only under the accidental 
                circumstances of their own temporary flourishing.<sup><font size="2"><sup><a href="#_edn29">29</a></sup></font></sup></p>
            </blockquote>
            <P> May reminds us that the virtues required to age well are the universal 
              virtues needed by human beings of every age; the old are not a separate 
              species but human beings living human lives who should be held to 
              human standards. These virtues do not develop and manifest themselves 
              simply by living a long time; they require active cultivation throughout 
              life, culminating but rarely beginning in old age. </P>
            <P> Yet these virtues do take a special form among the elderly; old 
              age is a particular time of life with particular ethical and existential 
              demands, a time when vigor and ambition begin to wane and when the 
              very meaning of one's existence presents itself with looming finality. 
              May also reminds us that the old live (or should live) among the 
              generations, not separate from them. He reminds us that the young 
              often benefit from the moral example of the old, and that the old 
              are more likely to age well when the rising generations stand with 
              them-as caregivers, to be sure, but also as recipients of the gifts 
              that the old alone are equipped to give. Even in their days of total 
              dependence, the old can still be a gift to the young. </P>
            <P> There is great human variation in how people age-variation dictated 
              by the particularities of each person's circumstances and by the 
              culture in which the aging person lives. But certain traits of character, 
              as May suggests, are always necessary to age well: <I>courage</I>, 
              including the capacity to keep one's fears in check even as one's 
              prospects worsen; <I>simplicity</I>, including the capacity to "travel 
              light" on one's final journey; <I>wisdom</I>, including the avoidance 
              of excessive nostalgia and excessive remorse; and <I>humor</I>, 
              including the wit that sometimes flourishes when the carefulness 
              of middle age is no longer required.<sup><font size="2"><sup><a href="#_edn30">30</a></sup></font></sup> 
              These virtues of the elderly-to which could be added gratitude and 
              acceptance, among others-<I>draw strength</I> from a society that 
              honors the old even when they can no longer produce at the high 
              levels they once did, and these virtues <I>give strength</I> to 
              a society where the old always seek to benefit those who must replace 
              them in the cycle of generations. The need to face aging and death-our 
              own and that of our loved ones-with clear minds, caring hearts, 
              and human solidarity reminds us that virtue has not become obsolete 
              in our high-tech world. </P>
            <P> The personal experience of aging is, of course, more than a matter 
              of virtue. The particularities of that experience are shaped by 
              many factors-biological, psychological, and sociological-that we 
              might review in turn. </P>
            <P> </P>
            <strong><em>A. Biological Nature and Environment</em></strong> <P> 
              Gerontologists define "normal aging" as follows: "A time-dependent 
              series of cumulative, progressive, intrinsic, and harmful changes 
              that begin to manifest themselves at reproductive maturity and eventually 
              end in death. Primary aging would describe those changes that occur 
              over time independent of any specific disease or trauma to the body, 
              whereas secondary aging would describe disabilities resulting from 
              forces such as disease."<sup><font size="2"><sup><a href="#_edn31">31</a></sup></font></sup> 
              While aging is a shared biological fact for human beings as a species, 
              the trajectory of biological aging differs dramatically from person 
              to person, due both to one's unique genetic inheritance and to variable 
              environmental influences that shape each person differently throughout 
              life. For some, nature tragically prevents even the possibility 
              of old age, death arriving before the person can grow old or grow 
              up; for others, genetic predilections toward longevity are inherited 
              from long-lived ancestors. For those fortunate enough to live a 
              long life, the process of aging and decline takes many different 
              shapes: some live vigorously until the end, then die a swift or 
              sudden death; some suffer a gradual period of bodily decline, with 
              sufficient time and self-awareness to see aging as the final chapter 
              of a complete life; some suffer dementia and live through long years 
              of diminished awareness and total dependence. </P>
            <P> This biological trajectory is influenced significantly in our 
              time by the possibilities and limits of modern medicine. Medicine 
              can prevent, reverse, or slow down some ailments; before other diseases 
              and disabilities, medicine stands-at least for now-relatively helpless. 
              Sudden and premature deaths are far less common than in the past; 
              extended decline and disability are far more common. But the process 
              of growing old always moves toward decline and death, even if the 
              route is very different from person to person. The vital trajectory 
              varies; the post-vital outcome does not. </P>
            <em><strong>B. The Presence or Absence of Loved Ones</strong></em> 
            <P> In crucial respects, everyone ages alone: for it is the self's 
              body alone that changes, the self's faculties alone that decline, 
              and the self's death alone that looms; these personal realities 
              cannot be shared fully by others. But at best, individuals do not 
              age and die by themselves (even if they must age and die <I>as</I> 
              themselves alone), but with family, friends, and caregivers who 
              stand with them. The rhythm and happiness of old age are shaped 
              greatly by the presence or absence of loved ones: by living with 
              or outliving one's longtime spouse; by having one's adult children 
              and grandchildren live nearby or far away; by living at home with 
              family or in a nursing home; by having or not having family altogether. 
              It is precisely because we must age and die alone that we need the 
              presence of others to help us age purposefully; to remind us that 
              life does not end with us but carries forward beyond us; and to 
              show us that we are valued for what we have to offer and even when 
              we can offer little in return. </P>
            <P> Perhaps no friendship in life is deeper than that between husband 
              and wife. As spouses think together about aging and dying, the meaning 
              of being alone presents itself sharply: what loving spouse would 
              not give his or her life to save a husband or a wife, and yet what 
              spouse wants to leave his or her beloved to age and die alone. As 
              with spouses, so it is with lifelong friends: It is a great blessing 
              to live a long life, but also a burden to outlive all one's closest 
              friends, and to face death without the camaraderie that they alone 
              might offer. The weight of loneliness is also felt in the relation 
              between an aging father or mother and his or her adult children 
              and grandchildren: the noble desire not to disrupt the children's 
              lives with one's own neediness co-exists with the desire to be needed 
              by them even in one's days of dependence, and cherished by them 
              when one's usefulness has passed. In the face of aging, our devotion 
              to others is both most tested and most required. There is sometimes 
              a powerful temptation to believe that elderly persons' lives are 
              so limited that fellowship is insignificant, a temptation to regard 
              being with them as little more than sitting awkwardly in a small 
              room in a smelly nursing home. If, because they remind us of our 
              own inevitable decline, we shun their company, we isolate them even 
              more. But often, it is precisely because the elderly have nothing 
              else that they need our fellowship most of all. </P>
            <em><strong>C. Wealth and Poverty</strong></em> <P> As the body ages, 
              health problems proliferate and worsen. The capacity to face these 
              problems-not only medically, but existentially-is affected significantly, 
              often decisively, by one's economic condition. Money alone hardly 
              ensures that wealthy individuals can age well; the absence of money 
              alone hardly means that poor individuals will age poorly. Many wealthy 
              persons suffer terribly in old age despite the best medicine that 
              money can buy, and many lack the character to live well as their 
              powers diminish. At the same time, many poor persons demonstrate 
              heroic virtue despite the lack of economic means, and they still 
              savor the gift of life despite its many hardships. But it is quite 
              obvious that having reliable health care, good nursing, and the 
              wherewithal to make life decisions free from severe economic pressures 
              often makes it significantly easier to age well. Being wealthy ensures 
              that one's bodily needs are attended to as well as possible, and 
              it allows the elderly person (for as long as nature cooperates) 
              to enjoy his or her final phase of life without living in a constant 
              state of economic anxiety. </P>
            <P> Of course, there will always be large disparities in the economic 
              condition of the elderly; this fact is unavoidable in any free society 
              (not to mention un-free societies, where the disparities between 
              the wealthy and the poor are usually much starker). But as a society, 
              we should aspire to provide every aging person some basic level 
              of economic security and medical care-including long-term care-while 
              always recognizing that providing support for the elderly is but 
              one great civic good among many, and while always remembering that 
              wealth alone is never a sufficient answer to the human dilemmas 
              of aging.<font size="2"><sup><a href="#_ftn7">vii</a></sup></font> 
              Economic security does not translate simply into existential security. 
              Money does not give life meaning in the face of death. But as one 
              faces great physical trials and ultimate human questions in one's 
              final days, it is surely a great blessing to do so without the constant 
              fear or present reality of economic disaster, or the constant worry 
              that good care for oneself means years of hardship for one's spouse, 
              children, or grandchildren. </P>
            <P> </P>
            <em><strong>D. Vocation and Avocation</strong></em> <P> Since old 
              age is a distinguishable phase of human life, it makes sense to 
              consider the distinct purposes and obligations that define it and 
              the connection of these purposes and obligations to the other phases 
              of one's life. The answer is hardly the same for everyone, and it 
              obviously shifts from one period of old age to the next. For some, 
              old age is a time for novel pursuits-a time to explore interests 
              that have been put off year after year in order to meet the demands 
              of full-time parenting and full-time work. For others, it is a time 
              to return to old passions or to renew the existing bonds of family 
              and friendship. For some, aging is a time to continue one's life 
              work. For others-and eventually for everyone-aging means learning 
              to "let go" of the things one has done throughout life; it means 
              "retirement" in the true sense-no more fixing cars, taking hikes, 
              sailing boats, or attending concerts. To age is to experience intermittent 
              finitudes on the way to the ultimate finitude that is death. And 
              for some, the central work of growing old is learning how to die-how 
              to let go, how to say goodbye, how to ask forgiveness, and how to 
              put one's existence and one's memory in the hands of others. </P>
            <P> At best, the vocations and avocations of old age are not mere 
              distractions to pass the time, or simple amusements that temporarily 
              blur the realities of finitude. Amusement is not to be disparaged; 
              it is as essential to old age as to other phases of life, and being 
              amused is sometimes an achievement of character in circumstances 
              where there are many reasons to be miserable. But constant amusement-cruises, 
              bingo, television, and so on-may not be the best way to confront 
              the seriousness of being old. Aging rightly forces reflection on 
              the character of one's life as a whole. It often involves living 
              with opposites: cultivating new interests, new sensibilities, or 
              new understandings of the world, while letting go of old loves, 
              old jobs, and old pursuits that once loomed large in one's identity. 
              Pursuing the ideal of aging well is never work for the weak-spirited. 
              It invites us to see our final years as the culmination of a human 
              whole, with a deepening sense that one's life is not simply an arbitrary 
              sequence of events but a coherent narrative with a beginning, a 
              middle, and a meaningful end. Not everyone, alas, is so fortunate 
              as to be able to do so. </P>
            <P> </P>
            <strong><em>E. Male or Female</em></strong> <P> While aging is a common 
              human experience, it would be a mistake to ignore some differences 
              between men and women during this time of life. As a sociological 
              and demographic fact, women tend to outlive men, and thus more often 
              face the burdens of living as widows than do men the burdens of 
              living as widowers. This means that women are more likely than men 
              to sleep in beds that now feel empty, having spent months or years 
              caring for the person who once slept alongside them. This comparatively 
              longer life also means that women are more likely than men to become 
              impoverished in their golden years, spending down their final assets 
              on long-term care, including the kind of care they may once have 
              provided to their husbands free of charge. </P>
            <P> There may also be certain inherent differences between men and 
              women when it comes to aging, both biological and psychological. 
              As William May suggests:</P>
            <blockquote> 
              <p> [W]omen receive an earlier and clearer biological preview of 
                aging-if not of mortality; menopause gives them a clear signal 
                that the wheel of existence turns downward toward the ground, 
                while men find ways to obscure in themselves whatever signals 
                they receive. Women tend more often than men to associate aging 
                and death with the corruption of bodily form; men, with a flagging 
                vitality. The corruption of the body shows up relentlessly in 
                the morning mirror; the failure of vitality overtakes in more 
                elusive ways and is suppressed more easily in men.<sup><font size="2"><sup><a href="#_edn32">32</a></sup></font></sup><font size="2"> 
                <sup><a href="#_ftn8">viii</a></sup></font></p>
            </blockquote>
            <P> Other existential realities-such as the transition from work to 
              retirement or from a full nest to an empty nest-once affected men 
              and women in profoundly different ways. But as the familial and 
              social roles of men and women have become less clearly demarcated, 
              the differential effect of these experiences on men and women is 
              perhaps less significant, even as the experiences themselves are 
              no less profound. Yet despite the fluidity of male and female roles, 
              it still remains the case that women serve much more extensively 
              than men as caregivers for the dependent, including and especially 
              for the dependent elderly. And it may be that this experience of 
              caregiving makes women more attuned to the realities of aging, and 
              thus more prepared existentially and ethically when they age and 
              decline themselves. </P>
            <P> </P>
            <strong><em>F. Mind and Body</em></strong> <P> Although aging proceeds 
              in one direction-toward the gradual breakdown of the whole body, 
              ending in natural death-senescence is not a unified process that 
              affects equally all systems of the body and mind. Different people 
              age in different ways, in part because they lose different capacities 
              at different times, and in part because they lose some capacities 
              and not others before they die. Some individuals suffer long-term 
              physical disability with their mental capacities and self-awareness 
              firmly intact until the very end of their lives. For others, cognitive 
              disability or dementia sets in and grows severe even as the body 
              remains relatively healthy, with the total breakdown of the body's 
              systems coming only much later, often years later. The experience 
              of aging is thus shaped profoundly by the health of the body in 
              relation to the health of the mind, and the health of the mind in 
              relation to the health of the body. It is also shaped by the specific 
              manner in which the body fails or the mind deteriorates-as well 
              as by how well the individual is able to adapt to and compensate 
              for any diminution of function. </P>
            <P> The combination of physical debility and cognitive health can 
              bring a host of personal frustrations: the powerful desire to do 
              something for oneself or another, even the simplest thing, but not 
              being able to do it; the inability to control one's bowels, with 
              enough awareness to be embarrassed by it; the heartache of watching 
              loved ones sacrifice so much on one's behalf, when all one wants 
              is for them to flourish themselves. Yet the gift of self-awareness 
              until the end is also great. The aging individual with a healthy 
              mind and sick body can still savor some of life's greatest joys-experiential, 
              interpersonal, and intellectual. He might still be able to read 
              his favorite books, listen to his favorite music, see a grandchild 
              off to the prom, and thank a devoted family caregiver. But the grave 
              imbalance of physical and mental powers also often brings its own 
              special misery-including the feeling of being trapped inside a body 
              that does not respond to one's desires, needs, and efforts at control. 
            </P>
            <P> The gradual and extended loss of one's mental powers brings different 
              dilemmas, frustrations, and miseries, both for the suffering person 
              and for his or her caregivers. With a disease like Alzheimer's, 
              as we will explore more fully below, some people suffer at first 
              by knowing what is coming-by seeing one's mental powers decline, 
              one's memory erode, one's grasp of one's surroundings becoming hazy. 
              Eventually, this self-awareness of decline fades into the loss of 
              self-awareness entirely-including the inability to understand how 
              to behave appropriately, the incapacity to recognize loved ones, 
              and the confusion that comes with not remembering life from one 
              minute to the next or the paranoia that comes from not understanding 
              what others are doing and why. Eventually, with Alzheimer's and 
              other senile dementias, this cognitive disability becomes so severe 
              that it leads to physical disability-the inability to speak, to 
              control one's bowels, to eat and drink. Eventually, as the mind 
              shuts down completely, so too does the body. </P>
            <P> As we contemplate the imbalances of physical and mental health 
              that often shape how we age, we confront the puzzling unity and 
              disunity that is the human person. We come to see that we are an 
              indivisible unity of the mind-and-body, but that often our will 
              wants what our bodies cannot do and cannot be. The individual both 
              has a body and is a body, even when he resents all the things the 
              body cannot do or all the pain the body causes, experiences, and 
              endures. And eventually, in death, this experience of imbalance 
              leads to a unified ending: the death of the whole self, mind-and-body 
              together. </P>
            <em><strong> G. A Person's View of Death</strong></em> <P> Our views 
              on death obviously shape how we age, though these views often take 
              firmer shape only as we age. Aging leads to death-the final limit 
              on earthly life and a fact of our humanity that cannot be disputed 
              or avoided. But there is deep disagreement about what the end of 
              embodied life means for the human person who once lived. Many of 
              us live with great uncertainty about the meaning of death. We live 
              between faith and doubt, fear and serenity, obsession and blindness. 
              Many others have firmer ideas about what death is-whether a supreme 
              faith in redemption and resurrection after death, or a firm belief 
              that life here-and-now provides no evidence for life hereafter, 
              or a belief that an obsession with personal death only blurs the 
              perfect nothingness (or nirvana) that is being itself. </P>
            <P> Moreover, there is no simple formula for judging how one's views 
              on death will shape one's approach to aging. Some of those who believe 
              that the self disappears entirely after death will resist death 
              at all costs, struggling to preserve bodily life against the prospect 
              of total oblivion. Others with the same belief conclude that the 
              self is the final judge of its own existence, including the arbiter 
              of its own exit. In this view, the ravages of aging might be justifiably 
              preempted by choosing or embracing death, on the grounds that happiness 
              here-and-now is the only measure of life's worth and that some kinds 
              of old age are too miserable or undignified to endure. For still 
              others, a belief in the utter finality of personal death might lead 
              to a kind of stoic virtue, enduring aging and death as an example 
              of uprightness for those who will one day die themselves. </P>
            <P> The widespread belief that life does not end here-that salvation, 
              resurrection, or reincarnation is possible after death-can also 
              influence how one views one's own aging. For some, this means that 
              aging is both a burden that must be endured and a sacred passageway 
              to divine salvation. Such an emphasis on the hereafter might make 
              death seem less horrible because it is less final; or it might make 
              death seem more frightening because one fears eternal judgment. 
              To believe in heaven often means believing in hell; the comforts 
              of faith often coexist with terrible anxiety about the fate of one's 
              immortal soul. </P>
            <P> In the modern age, as suggested above, many people live somewhere 
              between certainty and doubt about the meaning of death: they hope 
              for salvation, but cannot be sure; they see little reason to believe 
              in life hereafter, but know that the origin and destiny of life 
              is a mystery they cannot finally solve. But whatever one's views 
              on these ultimate questions, death is both an <I>evil</I> and a 
              <I>necessity</I> for all bodily beings: Death is an evil, because 
              it can strike at any moment, because it robs us of those we love, 
              and because the overwhelming fear of death can deform how we live. 
              And death is a necessity, because as biological beings we are not 
              made to live forever, and because much that is good in human life 
              depends on accepting and living out our roles as self-conscious 
              mortals. In death, one generation stands aside for the next. The 
              ripeness of age gives way to the freshness of youth. In some ways, 
              aging appears as a series of small dyings on the way to death, but 
              also the drama of taking one's place in the ongoing chain of generations, 
              ideally with more gratitude than bitterness for the life one has 
              lived. </P>
            <em><strong>H. Conclusion: Modernity and the Lifecycle</strong></em> 
            <P> This drama of growing old, passing down, and passing on is hardly 
              new. It has always been at the heart of the human lifecycle, recognized 
              by the wise men and women of every age (even before old age as we 
              know it today became so commonplace). In <I>De Senectute</I>, Cicero 
              gave voice to this human reality of ascent and decline: "The course 
              of life is fixed, and nature admits of its being run but in one 
              way, and only once; and to each part of our life there is something 
              specially seasonable."<sup><font size="2"><sup><a href="#_edn33">33</a></sup></font></sup> 
              The question we now face, however, is whether the idea of a "cycle 
              of life," with its several and differently meaningful stages, still 
              makes sense to us-both as a lived experience and as a guiding belief. 
              Do we still regard each phase of life as possessing its own "seasonable" 
              quality, where the trajectory of one's own life interlocks with 
              the trajectory of the generations? Or do we live, in some sense, 
              "after the lifecycle," with the expectation of extended youth or 
              extended decline, and with a confused sense of how life's many phases 
              fit together or how the self's demise relates to the ascent of those 
              who will stand in our place?<font size="2"><sup><a href="#_ftn9">ix</a></sup></font> 
            </P>
            <P> Already, we seem to be extending youthful vitality into what once 
              seemed like old age, and at the very least, we now <I>expect</I> 
              healthy living and medical progress to keep us "feeling young" at 
              ages that were once considered old. In the future, we may not see 
              70 or 80 as part of old age but rather as part of the long middle 
              of life. At the same time, however, we may be entering an age in 
              which extended decline and dependence also become widespread, and 
              when a long period of being unable to care for oneself becomes the 
              normal pathway to death. These changes in how we age are taking 
              shape alongside myriad changes in the rhythm of the earlier phases 
              of life-including when people marry, when they have children, how 
              many children they have, and the kind of work they perform. The 
              old increasingly care for the very old, and the young increasingly 
              see the old at a distance-both geographically and pedagogically, 
              shaped by a culture that often prizes mobility and novelty over 
              stability and tradition. </P>
            <P> To say that we live "after the lifecycle" is surely an exaggeration: 
              the outlines of growth and decline still hold in our lives, as does 
              the sense that life has a shape, with different phases, each with 
              different qualities. But we also seem to be living in a new moment, 
              both sociologically and psychologically: The age structure of society 
              has changed and is changing; the decades of life are starting to 
              hold new meaning; and the expectations we impose on old age are 
              evolving both positively and negatively, with high hopes and great 
              fears. These changes have been brought about in part by modern medicine's 
              transformation of the trajectory of life, illness, and death and 
              by modern culture's emphasis on independence, individual self-rule, 
              and career as the major sources of self-esteem. </P>
            <P> The rising prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias 
              in old age only makes these questions about the trajectory of life 
              more acute. Besides the normal fear of senescence and death, many 
              people are horrified at the thought of ending their lives only after 
              a long period not just of physical frailty and disability but also 
              of mental incapacitation, impaired memory, diminished awareness, 
              loss of modesty and self-control, distortion of personality and 
              temperament, inability to recognize friends and loved ones, and 
              general dullness and enfeeblement of inner life. It seems a cruel 
              irony that the very medical advances that have kept many of us reasonably 
              healthy into a ripe old age have, by the same token, exposed us 
              to the ravages of incurable and progressive dementia, and to the 
              prospect that our life's drama may well end with an extended final 
              act marked by a gradual descent into mindlessness. In the next section 
              we set the stage for a deeper discussion of this dilemma by giving 
              an overview of the clinical and experiential facts about dementia 
              and specifically Alzheimer's disease-an illness that terrifies many 
              and requires years of constant care. </P>
            <h3></h3>
            <h3> III. Dementia and the Human Person</h3>
            <P> Dementia is not a specific disease but a condition of disordered 
              and diminished intellectual functioning, usually involving disorientation, 
              impaired memory, confused thinking, disturbed speech, defective 
              judgment, emotional instability and (later) apathy, and erosion 
              of self-awareness. These deficiencies, most often progressive, can 
              result from a wide variety of underlying diseases and disorders 
              of the brain, having a wide variety of causes-traumatic, toxic, 
              metabolic, vascular, degenerative. The dementias of old age are 
              largely of two types, though with possible overlap: the dementia 
              caused by vascular disease (so-called multi-infarct dementia, the 
              result of multiple small strokes) and the dementia caused by Alzheimer's 
              disease. Because its incidence is rising rapidly as our society 
              ages, and because it generates the most personal anxiety and public 
              disquiet, we shall concentrate on Alzheimer's disease. But many 
              of the implications for caregiving apply equally well for persons 
              suffering from the other dementias and, indeed, from other forms 
              of frailty that afflict the elderly. </P>
            <P> The assault on a person's mental faculties brought on by Alzheimer's 
              disease is insidious in onset and slowly but implacably progressive 
              in character. It usually runs a course from onset to death of about 
              6 to 10 years, though it may last up to twice as long. In its early 
              phase, the symptoms are mild and only modestly impairing. But as 
              it advances, slowly and with no particularly defined signposts of 
              its progress, essentially all aspects of human mental capacity are 
              first disordered and then destroyed, with the patient at the end 
              bedfast, helpless, and mute. It is a distressing condition to witness 
              and a frightening one in prospect.<font size="2"><sup><a href="#_ftn10">x</a></sup></font> 
            </P>
            <P> Alzheimer's disease is one of the most common mental disorders, 
              making up some 20 percent of patients in psychiatric hospitals and 
              a far higher percentage of patients in nursing homes and assisted 
              living facilities. Because the diagnosis cannot be definitively 
              established save by autopsy, it is difficult to get accurate numbers 
              for incidence (rate of new cases per year) and prevalence (total 
              number of cases at a given time) of the disease. Still, almost all 
              estimates indicate that both incidence and prevalence are increasing, 
              and rapidly, in parallel with the rapid growth in the numbers of 
              people living into their seventies, eighties, and nineties. Although 
              the personal risk of developing Alzheimer's disease in the United 
              States has not changed since Alois Alzheimer first described the 
              illness in 1907, clinicians are seeing more new cases each year 
              because Americans are living long enough to develop the disease. 
            </P>
            <P> Estimates vary as to the number of individuals affected by Alzheimer's 
              disease, but all studies concur that risk increases with age. Estimates 
              of the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease in the United States for 
              the year 2000 range from 2.17 to 4.78 million cases;<sup><font size="2"><sup><a href="#_edn34">34</a></sup></font></sup> 
              <sup><font size="2"><sup><a href="#_edn35">35</a></sup></font></sup> 
              4.5 million is the figure cited by the Alzheimer's Association.<sup><font size="2"><sup><a href="#_edn36">36</a></sup></font></sup> 
              Among persons 85 and over (4.86 million in 2004<sup><font size="2"><sup><a href="#_edn37">37</a></sup></font></sup>), 
              almost 40 percent (1.8 million) may be affected.<sup><font size="2"><sup><a href="#_edn38">38</a></sup></font></sup> 
              Assuming no major breakthroughs in treatment that would delay incidence 
              or retard disease progression, estimates of future prevalence (in 
              2050) are about fourfold the 2000 rate. And even with new treatment 
              modalities that might slow the onset of the disease, none of the 
              projections expects less than a three-fold rise in prevalence in 
              2050.<sup><font size="2"><sup><a href="#_edn39">39</a></sup></font></sup>

            <P> </P>
            <strong><em>A. The Phases of Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong> <P> 
              The typical course of Alzheimer's disease can be roughly divided 
              into three phases of increasing severity and disability. Patients 
              begin with barely noticeable lapses in "recent memory" (the memory 
              of immediate events). This memory deficit-first recognized perhaps 
              only by a tendency to repeat comments or questions-increases over 
              time to disorientation and confusion. This confusion may provoke 
              occasional but very distressing emotional reactions of bewilderment 
              and anger, dubbed "catastrophic reactions," that frighten both patient 
              and family. Many mental capacities, however, are retained in this 
              first phase, which usually lasts two to four years. The basic personalities 
              of the individuals remain intact and they can enjoy many of life's 
              experiences. Even as their friends and family look with fear for 
              the future, they also notice how engaged the afflicted individuals 
              can often be in daily events. </P>
            <P> As the cognitive decline worsens, the disorder enters a second 
              phase of another two or three years, marked by a progressive collapse 
              of language functions (word finding, reading, and writing) and difficulties 
              in manual skills (dressing, eating, and personal care). The patients 
              now tend to wander, becoming lost even in familiar neighborhoods 
              as their disorientation and confusion worsens. They often become 
              preoccupied with suspicions aroused usually by mistakes of comprehension 
              and attribution, but also by hallucinations and delusions. These 
              suspicions lead to more severe emotional outbursts and, sometimes, 
              physical aggression. A depression can emerge and become a crippling 
              and persisting state of mind. And as the disruptions of affect, 
              thought, language, and manual skills alter all their relationships 
              with others, patients begin to fail at recognizing friends and family 
              and seem to be fading out of contact with others. </P>
            <P> In the third and final stage, the disorder takes the form of loss 
              of control of bodily functions and motor powers. Walking becomes 
              impossible, soon followed by generalized paralysis, confinement 
              to bed, and incontinence of bladder and bowel function. Within a 
              year or two, the patients sink into a state of relative mutism and 
              unresponsiveness, neglecting all external stimuli or inner needs 
              and their continuing existence depends entirely on nursing care. 
              They eventually die from inanition or some intercurrent infection 
              such as aspiration pneumonia.<font size="2"><sup><a href="#_ftn11">xi</a></sup></font> 
            </P>
            <P> This basic description of the clinical course emphasizes the growing 
              losses of mental capacity that lead inexorably to the fading away 
              of the self-a phenomenon distressing to witness and, for many patients 
              early in their disease, distressing to experience. But the sense 
              of "curse" now evoked by the very name, "Alzheimer's," overlooks 
              the fact that patients-especially in the first phase-often have 
              much to enjoy in life, even as much is lost. And these pleasures 
              ("smelling the roses" is a useful shorthand)-perhaps becoming more 
              momentary and transient over time-extend even into later stages, 
              as patients wander in and out of relative lucidity. Many doctors 
              and nurses find great reward in caring for these patients and their 
              families. Clinical efforts to treat symptoms of depression and delusion, 
              to offer friendly social and occupational therapy, and to simplify 
              and regularize daily routines produce much comfort and reassuring 
              support for patients while they are still able to appreciate many 
              of life's simple pleasures. Yet the truth remains that Alzheimer's 
              disease is a most distressing human affliction in which almost all 
              that is vital to human character and dignity is gradually lost, 
              but for which certain forms of care, discussed below, can bring 
              great benefits to both patient and families. </P>
            <P> </P>
            <strong><em>B. Cause and Remedy</em></strong> <P> The symptoms of 
              Alzheimer's are caused by a generalized disease of the brain, characterized 
              by loss of neurons and resulting atrophy of the cerebral hemispheres, 
              especially in the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes. Extreme 
              atrophy of the hippocampus is uniformly characteristic, accounting 
              for the early and severe memory loss typical of all patients. Eventually, 
              though, the atrophy becomes generalized; at time of death, the brain 
              has shrunken by more than 20 percent of its original volume. On 
              microscopic examination, three identifiable pathologic changes are 
              characteristic: (1) "amyloid plaques," extra-cellular deposits of 
              accumulated beta-amyloid, an amorphous, insoluble, protein substance, 
              surrounded by bits of degenerated nerve fibers; (2) "neurofibrillary 
              tangles," diffusely distributed, shrunken neurons that are filled 
              with thickened tangled fibers; and (3) "granulovacuolar" degeneration, 
              which affects other neurons, particularly within the hippocampus. 
              These pathologic changes in the brain advance steadily and correlate 
              with the progressing severity of the patient's dementia. </P>
            <P> The underlying causes of Alzheimer's disease are complex, with 
              both genetic and environmental factors playing a role. But recent 
              biochemical studies on the plaques and neurofibrillary tangles have 
              led to a reasonably detailed hypothesis regarding the sequence of 
              pathogenetic steps that lead ultimately to neuronal death, atrophy, 
              and clinical dementia.<font size="2"><sup><a href="#_ftn12">xii</a></sup></font> 
              And this hypothesis is now directing intense scientific investigation 
              in search of measures that could prevent, interrupt, or retard the 
              pathological process that produces the plaques and tangles. For 
              the first time, scientists are hopeful of finding interventions 
              that could interfere with the pathogenic processes in ways that 
              might make radical correction and even prevention possible. </P>
            <P> At this time, therapeutic approaches are of three types: treatment 
              of symptoms, replacement therapies, and experimental efforts aimed 
              at interrupting the pathogenic process. Symptomatic treatments seek 
              to help patients and families with the growing disability brought 
              by the disease. They begin with aids to memory and orientation that 
              regularly remind the patient of the present time and place and ultimately 
              extend to protective services to help patients who wander or get 
              lost, to nursing services for dilapidating self-care, and to the 
              management (with medications) of some of the symptomatic depressions, 
              hallucinations, seizures and the like that come with the progress 
              of the condition.<font size="2"><sup><a href="#_ftn13">xiii</a></sup></font> 
            </P>
            <P> Replacement therapies seek to supply chemical deficiencies caused 
              by the degeneration of neurons, for example, acetyl choline, a stimulating 
              neurotransmitter whose reduced activity in the cerebral cortex correlates 
              roughly with the degree of cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's patients. 
              Medications that slow the breakdown of acetyl choline (by inhibiting 
              acetyl-cholinesterase, the enzyme responsible for its turnover) 
              and thus leave higher levels of this neurotransmitter in synapses 
              have been demonstrated to slow the progress of the disease in some 
              patients in the early first phase often by as much as a year or 
              more. </P>
            <P> Still unproven but extremely exciting are experimental trials 
              aimed directly at the pathological process itself, and particularly 
              at the presumptively toxic role of the accumulating beta-amyloid 
              protein. These include measures that could decrease the production 
              of the protein, block its agglutination, or protect the neurons 
              from the toxic effects of its accumulation. Perhaps the most exciting 
              experimental approach is the use of immunization to yield antibodies 
              to beta-amyloid protein, so as to reduce its amount in the brain 
              or to clear it after it has accumulated.<font size="2"><sup><a href="#_ftn14">xiv</a></sup></font> 
            </P>
            <P> All of these experimental approaches offer the promise of becoming 
              disease-modifying treatments that could prevent the onset or greatly 
              slow the progress of Alzheimer's disease. If it were possible by 
              one of these means to postpone the onset of the disease beyond the 
              normal lifespan or even for five to ten years, there would be a 
              great reduction in the incidence of the disease and many of those 
              who would get it later than they now do would die first of other 
              causes. This might be especially true if subjects genetically vulnerable 
              to Alzheimer's disease could be recognized before symptoms appear 
              and could be treated with measures to forestall the pathogenetic 
              "cascade." Optimism-long at a premium-is now growing in the research 
              community, where the view is held that within the coming decades 
              apt preventative and rational therapeutics will be found for Alzheimer's 
              disease. Yet at least for the present elderly and the baby boomer 
              generation, there is every reason to believe that Alzheimer's will 
              remain a major public health problem that will persist for decades. 
              Hope for a remedy is fitting; planning ahead based on its rapid 
              arrival is not. </P>
            <P> </P>
            <em><strong>C. Alzheimer's Disease and Human Experience</strong></em> 
            <P> Humanly speaking, Alzheimer's disease is not just a medical condition, 
              with a biological cause and sociological implications. It is also 
              a lived experience, for the ones who suffer it, for their family 
              and friends, and even for thousands of people who live in fear of 
              getting it. Not long ago, when dementia was less common and its 
              causes were unknown, a case of senile dementia was regarded by family 
              members as part of natural old age ("Dear grandpa has grown old 
              and forgetful") and of no direct concern to their own future. Today, 
              everyone is aware of this now-common disease that sometimes runs 
              in families, lacks effective treatment, and carries a dreaded name; 
              as a consequence, a case of Alzheimer's in the family is often experienced 
              as a terrifying or stigmatizing curse. People feel themselves at 
              risk of following the dreadful path they witnessed in parents or 
              grandparents, and many of them notice fearfully every clumsy mental 
              process they display after age 50, thinking it a harbinger of their 
              fate. The differentiation of Alzheimer's disease by name has successfully 
              launched effective and focused research enterprises, but it has 
              done so at the price of human disquiet and even terror, often inducing 
              depression in the "worried well," and sometimes even leading them 
              to suicide. </P>
            <P> The actual human experience of the disease itself varies greatly, 
              depending in part on the person's character and temperament, in 
              part on the progress of the disease. Many patients develop symptoms 
              so imperceptibly and gradually that, by the time someone brings 
              them for evaluation and the diagnosis is made, they are already 
              sufficiently impaired that they worry little about their future. 
              They are bothered rather by their present handicaps and especially 
              by the restrictions imposed on them, such as loss of independence 
              or revoking of driving privileges. But many people who come to doctors 
              seeking an explanation of their new mental impairments are already 
              worried about the import of their symptoms and are quite able to 
              appreciate the prognostically grim diagnosis. Individuals typically 
              respond according to their habitual ways of confronting bad situations. 
              Those with broad horizons and calm demeanors might look similarly 
              at this problem and seek to reassure their loved ones and themselves 
              that they are equipped to manage what comes. Those fortunate enough 
              to have a trusted physician who promises to stay with them all the 
              way through the illness might gain some comfort and reassurance. 
              Such support is, alas, unavailable to very many people, who lack 
              either a caring family or a trusted physician, or both. </P>
            <P> But for many, the uncertainty of their future is the most distressing 
              feature. Those who have habitually fought uncertainty by seeking 
              always to be in control will likely attempt a similar mastering 
              stance against this situation. But as they confront their loss of 
              control and their impotence to correct it, they can become the most 
              distressed of patients. They are particularly susceptible to the 
              urgings of those who advocate euthanasia and assisted suicide. Many 
              do in fact become despondent and dangerous to themselves, and some 
              contemplate suicide and occasionally succeed in the effort. Men 
              are more likely than women to take desperate action. Women are more 
              likely to become apathetically depressed. A kind, thoughtful, and 
              experienced physician can often bring a more detached sort of support 
              to this kind of patient than worried family members can. Indeed, 
              many of these desperate patients respond well to anti-depressant 
              medications and throw off their depression and their suicidal thoughts; 
              with the anti-depressant treatment their cognition can for a time 
              improve considerably.<font size="2"><sup><a href="#_ftn15">xv</a></sup></font> 
            </P>
            <P> With the advance of the disease, the patients' long-term worries 
              about prognosis are replaced by distress associated with their confusion 
              and occasional suspicions. They have trouble making themselves understood; 
              they cannot communicate what is bothering them. Here, as mentioned, 
              considerable comfort is brought when their daily schedule or rounds 
              of activity are routinized to minimize surprises, and they are frequently 
              reminded of the daily plan. Medications can help calm patients, 
              but if not used sparingly they can also undermine efforts to engage 
              patients in occupational therapy, daily exercise, or other stimulating 
              activities. With new nursing practices that emphasize cheerful and 
              responsive environments, patients often do better in skilled nursing 
              facilities than they do at home, and certainly better than they 
              once did under the restrain-and-restrict-them approach of the old 
              nursing homes. Ultimately, with the loss of all mental functions, 
              however, patients fall further away from human interaction, becoming 
              quite apathetic and absolutely dependent on nursing care. Yet even 
              in their largely apathetic state, they can often recognize and appreciate 
              the kindness shown to them and the affection represented in the 
              visits and responses of family. </P>
            <P> While the fear of Alzheimer's disease afflicts mainly the worried 
              well and some of those in the early stages of the disease, the psychic 
              distress caused by the disease often falls more heavily on loving 
              family members than on the patients themselves, especially as the 
              disease progresses. Paradoxically but mercifully, a patient's subjective 
              suffering frequently diminishes as his mental diminishment worsens. 
              The reverse is generally the case with the family. As the patient 
              fades from meaningful contact, the family's sorrow over what is 
              being lost increases; such distress is often held at bay only because 
              time and effort needed for the increased demands of care do not 
              allow for such reflective "indulgences." </P>
            <P> Alzheimer's disease is not the worst human affliction, nor is 
              it the only condition that oppresses the frail and feeble elderly. 
              But its special character-attacking not only the capacities that 
              are central to a flourishing human life but also the existence of 
              a self-knowing consciousness-creates its own special difficulties, 
              first for the patients, eventually for the onlookers. True, in the 
              early stages of the disease, reflective patients will suffer from 
              looking ahead to a future that is at once utterly uncertain and 
              utterly determined, a future before which those who like to be in 
              control will feel enormously discomfited. They will feel the frustrations 
              of failing to find the right words, of misremembering, of getting 
              lost. But the more the disease progresses, the more the sadness 
              resides with the family. The depression, the outbursts, the loss 
              of self-command, the disappearance of civilizing inhibitions, the 
              incontinence, and the inability to recognize or interact with loved 
              ones tear at the heart of spouses, children, and friends. It is 
              not easy to love in the same way a person who both is and is not 
              really there. </P>
            <P> Even those who believe in the redemptive power of suffering have 
              a hard time saying anything good about a condition that renders 
              the sufferer impervious to gaining any insight or improvement from 
              his troubles and burdens. And at the end, there is no possibility 
              for farewells, for reconciliations, for anything more than the harsh 
              reality of death modified by a relief that the ordeal is finally 
              over. Despite these hardships, many loving families continue to 
              care for those who have been given to them to love-loyally, steadfastly, 
              often heroically and without much outside support-continuing to 
              benefit as best they can the life that the person they love still 
              has. It is no wonder that this activity takes its toll, both mental 
              and physical, on the family caregivers, many of whom are often quite 
              elderly and infirm themselves and many of whom become depressed 
              or sick in other ways during what can be up to a decade of giving 
              care. </P>
            <P> Generalizations, of course, are always risky. As with the patients, 
              so different families will cope differently with their calling to 
              care, depending on temperaments and character, previous patterns 
              of family closeness and mutual assistance, and available economic 
              resources and social support. Families that have ever felt close 
              and supportive will be ready to do their utmost to care. Not only 
              devoted spouses, but also adult children of an affected parent often 
              take on the task of long-term care. Here the sense of loss can be 
              partially offset by a sense of satisfaction derived from the giving 
              of needed care, as well as from honoring the commitment to maintain 
              the dignity and modesty of the patient as much as possible through 
              the illness and its depredations. </P>
            <P> Occasionally, however, this sense of commitment can develop into 
              a guilt-ridden urge to do and give more than is reasonable or to 
              protect the patient against all change. Guilt and stress afflict 
              even the most devoted, strong, and resourceful families, who today 
              frequently find themselves in a bind, especially when adult women 
              try to care for their enfeebled parents or in-laws while holding 
              down jobs and caring for their own small children. The decision 
              to move Mom from her home into an assisted living facility, or Dad 
              from the spare room in our house to the nursing home is, for such 
              families, a wrenching decision, and the sense of betrayal that devoted 
              spouses and offspring feel on such occasions is often much to their 
              credit. But when home caregiving threatens the basic well-being 
              of the rest of the family, institutional care often becomes the 
              wisest choice under bad circumstances. Attentive physicians and 
              social service providers can help the family weather all stages 
              of the decline by advice, encouragement, medical interventions, 
              and the recruitment of support services for the patient and respite-care 
              for the caregivers. </P>
            <P> Finally, there are the decisions that must be made, ranging from 
              simple matters such as the use of ancillary medications to weighty 
              choices such as the use of "heroic measures" or life-sustaining 
              remedies. Choices that were simple and obvious early in the course 
              become more problematic as the disease worsens, and ultimately heart-wrenching 
              in their implications in the terminal phase. Close contacts between 
              a devoted physician, other professional caregivers, and the caregiving 
              family can help family members make their decisions conscientiously 
              and thoughtfully, with due regard for the life reaching the end 
              of this grim illness. But no one should pretend that this is anything 
              but anguishing for almost everyone involved. </P>
            <P CLASS="c2"></P>
            <h3> IV. Aging and the Common Good</h3>
            <P> Looking broadly, we seem to be on the cusp of an historically 
              unprecedented situation, both in the degree of care that elderly 
              individuals will need and in the proportion of society's resources 
              that will have to be devoted to such care. Medicine's success in 
              combating many acute illnesses has enabled us to live long enough 
              to suffer from various age-related chronic illnesses. For many, 
              longer, healthier life is enjoyed at the price of longer, later 
              periods of enfeeblement and disability. At the same time, our preoccupation 
              with individual self-fulfillment has weakened many intergenerational 
              attachments, and the privileged place of gainful employment and 
              career advancement in our notions of self-worth has diminished the 
              time available for and the value we place on caregiving. </P>
            <P> It was one thing to say that families should be responsible for 
              care of their aged relatives in an historical period when life expectancy 
              was 60 or 70 years of age and the period of dependency was limited. 
              But it is quite another when a period of dementia could stretch 
              out ten years, the last five of which require nonstop nursing care. 
              Moreover, the old social system that took care of aged family members 
              was dependent largely on the uncompensated labor of women; there 
              are extremely few families today that could provide this level of 
              support (by modern standards) without help from other social institutions 
              or social programs. And, as we have seen, many families are struggling, 
              especially women, who continue to bear the greatest burden of care 
              for the elderly, while also in many cases providing for growing 
              children and working outside the home in order to help make ends 
              meet. </P>
            <P> We cannot pretend that either families or society as a whole will 
              have unlimited resources, particularly as the age structure of our 
              population continues to change, with more elderly persons and fewer 
              young workers. We will have to make hard choices between competing 
              goods, both as families and as a nation. For example: Should Medicare 
              continue to cover every expensive new medical technology, and if 
              not, on what basis should the public set limits? Should families 
              accept inferior professional care for treasured elders to ensure 
              adequate resources to buy a home or send children to college? Should 
              we mandate that individuals with an annual income above a certain 
              threshold purchase long-term care insurance in order to socialize 
              the risk of dependence? These are not questions that we can address 
              in substantive detail in this inquiry. But they are the kinds of 
              questions that we must keep in mind as we think about the ethics 
              of caregiving for those elders who need it, including the ethical 
              dilemmas of deciding when to continue and when to forgo medical 
              treatment for persons with dementia (the main subject of the analysis 
              that follows). As we think about the meaning of aging and the moral 
              dilemmas that arise at the bedside, we cannot ignore the practical 
              realities that arise for society as a whole or the need to articulate 
              and pursue some shared vision of the common good. </P>
            <P> Of course, it is always best to state one's aspirations in the 
              positive, in terms of what we hope to achieve-such as a society 
              where aging has meaning, where death seems like the fitting conclusion 
              to a life well-lived, and where we help one another from generation 
              to generation. But there is also a wisdom in seeing clearly what 
              we hope to avoid, especially in situations where perfection is impossible 
              and where some hardship is inevitable. And here three points seem 
              worth stressing in relation to aging and the common good. </P>
            <P> First, we must avoid two errors or extremes: On the one hand, 
              we must erect firm and permanent safeguards against certain inhuman 
              "solutions" to the challenges of caring for the dependent elderly-such 
              as active euthanasia or the promotion of assisted suicide, solutions 
              that define a category of persons as "life unworthy of life" or 
              as persons deserving of abandonment and beyond the scope of our 
              care. On the other hand, we must avoid allowing long-term care for 
              the elderly and medical care in general to crowd out every other 
              civic good-such as educating the young, promoting human excellence 
              in the arts and beyond, and providing for our common defense. We 
              must never betray our elders, but we must also recognize that we 
              cannot (and should not) always do everything conceivable on their 
              behalf. </P>
            <P> Second, we must avoid two crises of caregiving: The first is the 
              danger that some old people will be abandoned or impoverished, with 
              no one to care for them, no advocate to stand with them, and inadequate 
              resources to provide for themselves. The second danger is the complete 
              transformation of caregiving into labor, creating a situation where 
              people's basic physical needs are efficiently provided for by "workers," 
              but their deeper human and spiritual needs are largely ignored, 
              because those with the closest ties are unable or unwilling to be 
              with them. </P>
            <P> Finally, we must avoid (or to some degree reverse) the full-scale 
              medicalization of old age, both in our outlook and in our institutions. 
              We increasingly see old age as both a bundle of needs and problems 
              demanding solution and as a time of life whose meaning is largely 
              given in terms of being and staying healthy and fit. This outlook 
              has created discontent with the lifecycle itself, produced an insatiable 
              desire for more and more medical miracles, created the illusion 
              that we can transcend our limitations and that death itself may 
              be pushed back indefinitely. More deeply, this outlook has engendered, 
              at least in some individuals, the illusion that independence is 
              in fact the whole truth about our lives, without giving full regard 
              to those attachments and obligations that bind and complete us. 
              We do not beget or rear ourselves, and neither do our children. 
              At every stage of life, we belong together, in sickness as in health. 
              Forgetfulness of these truths quickly converts independence into 
              loneliness, especially for the old. </P>
            <P> In the end, there is no "solution" to the problem of aging, at 
              least no solution that a civilized society could ever tolerate. 
              Rather, our task is to do the best we can with the world as it is, 
              improving what we can but especially avoiding as much as possible 
              the greatest evils and miseries of living with old age: namely, 
              the temptation of betrayal, the illusion of perpetual youth, the 
              despair of frailty, and the loneliness of aging and dying alone. 
              In the chapters that follow we will attempt to begin this task, 
              first, by outlining shortcomings in the current approach and then 
              by sketching an ethics of best care for the patient now here. </P>

              It is, of course, a leading goal of current medical research to 
              identify risk factors for our remaining chronic illnesses and to 
              reduce the disability that afflicts the "old-old," with the ultimate 
              objective of producing a pattern of life that is healthy almost 
              to the end.</font></P>

                It bears emphasizing that much could happen to alter these trends. 
                For example, increasing obesity and its consequences, widespread 
                industrial pollution, or greater vulnerability to global epidemics 
                (avian flu or antibiotic-resistant bacteria) might markedly alter 
                all the predictions, giving rise to a different set of medical 
                and social challenges than those anticipated in this report. Still, 
                it makes great sense to take our bearings from what we know and 
                what seems likely to occur if present trends continue. </font></P>

                The study also points out how the different trajectories toward 
                death require different strategies and instruments of care: hospice 
                for the first; ongoing disease management, advance-care planning, 
                and mobilizing service to the home for the second; Meals on Wheels 
                and home health aides, then institutional long-term care facilities 
                for the third. According to the study, the remaining 20 percent 
                of all deaths "are split between those who die suddenly and others 
                we have not yet learned how to classify." </font></P>

                Based on the RAND finding that 40 percent of people will die only 
                after a prolonged period of frailty and dwindling, elementary 
                statistics suggest that a married couple with four living parents 
                should have the following rough expectations: an 87 percent chance 
                that one or more of their parents will die in this way; a 52 percent 
                chance that two or more will; an 18 percent chance that three 
                or more will, and a 2.5 percent chance that all four parents will.

                In this section and the next we rely heavily on the work of Dr. 
                Joanne Lynn, a practicing physician long active in hospice care, 
                long-term care, and end of life issues, whose recent book, <I>Sick 
                to Death and Not Going to Take it Anymore!</I> (University of 
                California Press, 2004) offers a succinct summary and portrait 
                of caregiving today and an analysis of what may be a looming caregiving 
                crisis. Much of the following account of the present and future 
                realities of caregiving is based on the first chapter of her book.

                Making matters worse is a concurrent <I>ethical</I> crisis: we 
                are unclear about the moral significance of our new situation 
                and especially about what is owed, humanly speaking, to those 
                unable to care for themselves. We treat this subject in Chapters

                through public funds, it will come at the expense of other public

                Very few other dementia illnesses are exactly like Alzheimer's 
                disease. There is as yet no "biologic marker" identifiable during 
                life, and only evidence from brain tissue can confirm a clinical 
                diagnosis. However, in the 1980s a working group from the National 
                Institutes of Health developed clinical criteria with which the 
                diagnosis can be made with 85 to 90 percent accuracy (McKhann, 
                G., et al., "Clinical Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease," <I>Neurology</I> 
                34(7): 939-944, 1984 and Tierney, M. C., et al., "The NINCDS-ADRDA 
                Work Group Criteria for the Clincial Diagnosis of Probable Alzheimer's 
                Disease," <I>Neurology</I> 38(3): 359-364, 1988). This achievement 
                has been invaluable for epidemiologic studies (documenting the 
                prevalence of Alzheimer's disease in the population) and for research 
                purposes (identifying with confidence patients with Alzheimer's 
                disease for closer analysis and clinical research). </font></P>

                Several clinical features help differentiate the Alzheimer's course 
                from other forms of dementia and cognitive disablement. First, 
                there are no abrupt neurological events such as occur with cerebrovascular 
                strokes that can produce multi-infarct dementia. Alzheimer's disease 
                advances slowly and smoothly, problems with memory and other psychological 
                capacities dominate much of its course, and motor and sensory 
                symptoms such as paralysis do not appear until the terminal phase. 
                Second, the psychological impairments are global rather than specific 
                to memory or language alone. Detailed psychological testing will 
                often show this global feature even in the early stage when only 
                the memory seems disturbed. Third, consciousness in the sense 
                of awareness and wakefulness is also unaffected for most of the 
                course. Indeed, many observers of a patient note how he or she 
                retains much of their usual personality and interpersonal "style" 
                even as the analytic reasoning power is lost. This feature is 
                quite different from the states of mind associated with the intoxications 
                from kidney or liver failure. </font></P>

                Here is the hypothesis and its biochemical foundation. The plaques 
                consist largely of beta-amyloid protein (containing 40 or 42 amino 
                acids), produced by the normal turnover of a structural transmembrane 
                protein in brain cells (APP, for "beta-amyloid precursor protein") 
                that may have receptor functions. The neurofibrillary tangles 
                are masses of helically wound filaments, which are tangled and 
                thickened because they represent the aggregation of an insoluble 
                pathologic form of a normally highly soluble, cytoskeletal protein 
                called "tau." The "cascade" hypothesis for the pathogenesis of 
                Alzheimer's disease draws these biochemical observations into 
                a powerful explanatory idea. This hypothesis holds that the very 
                gradual extra-cellular accumulation (either through over-production 
                or slower clearance) of the beta-amyloid protein-particularly 
                the 42-amino acid form-is in theory toxic to cerebral neurons 
                and their synaptic connections. Accordingly, the beta-amyloid 
                protein could generate (by several mechanisms still under study) 
                a response in the neurons that leads (among other things) to the 
                intra-cellular (intra-neuronal) appearance of the pathologic form 
                of "tau" and gradual development of the destructive neurofibrillary 
                tangles that disrupt neuronal functioning and lead to neuronal 
                death. (See Dr. Dennis Selkoe's presentation to the Council, June 
                24, 2004, available online at http://www.bioethics.gov. See also

                Five particular psychic deficits call for symptomatic attention. 
                Amnesia, particularly difficulty retaining immediate happenings, 
                requires repetition and mnemonic aids. Aphasia or dysphasia, with 
                breakdown in word choice, requires patience and acceptance of 
                circumlocutions. Apraxia, particularly in managing simple manual 
                tasks such as dressing and toileting, requires close management 
                and assistance. Visual and spatial disorientation, including getting 
                lost in familiar places, requires regular support and guidance. 
                And affective disruptions, including episodic outbursts of anger 
                and fright produced by the sense of loss of control or change 
                of routine, are avoided more than treated by maintaining a daily 
                routine and by the reassuring presence of regular caregivers. 
                In addition, depression in the form of demoralized anxiety over 
                the implications of learning the diagnosis afflicts many patients 
                in the earliest phase; here, the reassurance of a committed physician 
                promising continuing care and assistance for the duration of the 
                disease is invaluable and essential. This "demoralization" must 
                be differentiated from a depressive disorder resting on the brain 
                pathology itself, quite frequent in Alzheimer's patients, which 
                typically responds to anti-depressant medications.</font></P>

                Such "vaccination" against beta-amyloid protein led to an antibody 
                response and the clearing of the beta-amyloid in mutant mice that 
                otherwise accumulated beta-amyloid in their brains. But the early 
                trials in humans ran into difficulties. "Active" immunization 
                of the antigen-antibody variety produced complications of an allergic 
                kind in some patients, so investigators have turned to "passive" 
                immunization by delivering exogenous anti-beta-amyloid antibodies 
                to patients with the disease. This "passive" immunization effort 
                is now undergoing clinical trial in human patients and the results 
                are eagerly awaited. </font></P>

              A crucial matter of differential diagnosis with middle-aged and 
              elderly patients is that severe depressive illness can slow cognition 
              severely all by itself. All neuropsychiatrists have seen patients 
              believed to have Alzheimer's disease turn out to be afflicted by 
              a recurrence of a depressive illness that, in attacks, had been 
              seen earlier in their life but that on this occasion was misidentified 
              (and thus long untreated) as Alzheimer's. Suicide in these depressed 
              and misdiagnosed patients is also not rare. </font></P>
