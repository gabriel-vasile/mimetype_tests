There are many faults in the Bay Area certain to produce large earthquakes in the future. All Bay Area communities are at risk from the damaging effects of quakes&#8212;strong shaking, landsliding, and liquefaction. Scientists estimate that there is more than a 60% chance of a damaging earthquake striking the region in the next 30 years.

<h5>Since the Great earthquake of 1906, much has been learned about earthquake hazards and vulnerabilities in the Bay Area:</h5>
<p><ul><li>
<i><font color="red">We know why earthquakes occur here&#8212;</font></i>The Bay Area straddles the boundary where two of the Earth&#8217;s largest tectonic plates meet and slowly move past one another. When boundary faults break and the North American and Pacific Plates lurch past each other, quakes occur.
</p>
<p><li>
<i><font color="red">We know large and damaging earthquakes are certain to occur in the future&#8212;</font></i>At least eight faults in the Bay Area are capable of producing earthquakes of magnitude 6.7 or larger. Such quakes can kill and injure many people and cause substantial damage to buildings, roads, bridges, and utilities.
</p>
<p><li>
<i><font color="red">We know how to reduce losses in future large earthquakes&#8212;</font></i>Building codes have been improved, some older buildings strengthened, and bond measures approved to upgrade critical facilities. Some Bay Area residents have secured their homes to better withstand shaking, created emergency plans and disaster supply kits, and held home earthquake drills.
<h5>BUT we have not done enough to be prepared for the next large earthquake:</h5>
<p><li>
<i><font color="red">Fewer than 10% of households have disaster plans&#8212;</font></i>If an earthquake occurred right now, where would you go to be safe? If you are at work and your children are at school when the earthquake occurs, how will you get back together?
</p>
<p><li>
<i><font color="red">Fewer than 10% of homeowners have taken steps to retrofit their homes&#8212;</font></i>Is your home bolted to its foundation? If you live in an older building, has it been retrofitted? Is your water heater strapped? Could unsecured furniture or objects fall and cause injury or damage?
</p>
<p><li>
<i><font color="red">Fewer than 50% of households have disaster supply kits&#8212;</font></i>You will likely be on your own in the hours and days following an earthquake. Are you prepared with water, food, first aid supplies, and medications?

We know that the San Andreas Fault produces large earthquakes and that many other Bay Area faults are also hazardous. However, even knowing this, it can be difficult to understand how to use this information to make us safer in our daily lives. Should we care only if we live near the San Andreas Fault, or is every place in the Bay Area just as dangerous?

<p>
This eight-page section describes where earthquakes occur in northern California. It also explains how earthquakes will shake the ground and cause damage in other ways, such as liquefaction and landslides (see pages 8 through 11). Technical terms used throughout this book are explained in the Glossary (see page 31).

The idea or myth of California sliding into the Pacific Ocean in an earthquake and creating new beachfront property to the east appeals to those having a bit of fun at the Golden State&#8217;s expense. Although part of the State west of the San Andreas Fault system is very slowly moving northward and in millions of years could become an island, earthquakes caused by this horizontal motion of the Earth&#8217;s tectonic plates will not make California disappear into the sea, like fabled Atlantis.

<h2><font color="red">History Shows That Damaging Earthquakes Have Occurred Throughout the Bay Area...</font></h2>
<p>
In the last half of the 1800s, damaging earthquakes (magnitude 6 or greater) occurred in the San Francisco Bay region on average every 4 years. However, this changed in 1906:
</p>
<p>
<ul><li>
On April 18, 1906, the San Andreas Fault ruptured violently over a length of 300 miles, causing damage from San Juan Bautista north as far as Eureka. This magnitude 7.8 earthquake&#8212;the &#8220;Great San Francisco earthquake&#8221;&#8212;relieved stresses on faults throughout the bay region. 
<br />
<li>
Because fault stresses were reduced, the rate of large quakes in the San Francisco Bay region dropped abruptly after the 1906 earthquake. 
<br />
<li>
The three-quarters of a century following the 1906 quake was a golden age for the bay region, in which urban areas and population expanded rapidly during a time of minimal quake activity.
<br />
<li>
Although the level of seismic activity has not yet reached that of the late 1800s, since 1906 stresses on Bay Area faults have been building up once again. The area can expect more frequent and stronger earthquakes in the future.

</p>

<p>
There is a 62% probability that at least one earthquake of magnitude 6.7 or greater will occur on a known or unknown San Francisco Bay region fault before 2032. After a century of study by geologists, many faults have been mapped in the region, but not all faults are apparent at the surface&#8212;some quakes occur on previously unknown faults.
</p>
<p>
An example of a damaging quake on a previously unknown fault is the September 3, 2000, Yountville (Napa) earthquake.  This magnitude 5.2 quake struck at 1:36 a.m., 10 miles northwest of Napa, rudely awakening many residents of the Bay Area. It injured 25 people, caused at least $10 million in damage, and forced 70 people to seek shelter at Red Cross facilities.
</p>



<h2><font color="red">Most Earthquake Damage Is Caused by Shaking...</font></h2>
<p>

Damage in earthquakes is mainly from shaking. The intensity of shaking that a structure will experience during an earthquake is a function of three main factors:
</p>
<ul><li>

(1) The magnitude of the earthquake&#8212;the larger the quake, the stronger the shaking.
</br>
<li>
(2)  The distance from the fault that ruptured&#8212;the nearer you are to the fault, the greater the shaking.
</br>
<li>
(3)  The type of ground materials beneath the structure&#8212;soft soils amplify the shaking; hard bedrock does not.
</ul></p>

<i>Buildings in the Marina District of San Francisco were badly damaged in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. &#8220;Soft story&#8221; buildings, typically with parking on ground floor, like the one pictured here, are common throughout the Bay Area and are particularly at risk when exposed to strong shaking.

<i>
<ul><li>
On this map, bands of highest expected shaking generally follow major faults. 
<br />
<li>
Shaking levels are also influenced by the type of materials underlying an area&#8212;soft soils tend to amplify and prolong shaking, even at great distances from a quake. 
<br />
<li>
The worst soft soils in the Bay Area are the loose clays and filled areas bordering San Francisco Bay and the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. 
<br />
<li>
Deep soils in valleys shake more than bedrock in the hills&#8212;most urban development 
is in the valleys.

Intense shaking can damage even strong, modern buildings and their contents.

<h2><font color="red">Earthquakes Also Cause Damage in Other Ways...</font></h2>

<p>

Although most earthquake damage is caused by shaking, other damaging effects of quakes can be just as devastating. For example, in the Great 1906 earthquake, the shaking damage in San Francisco was followed by fires that raged through the city almost uncontrolled, in part because water mains had broken in the quake. These and other destructive effects of quakes are discussed below.

<h2><font color="red">The Disastrous 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake Was Not the &#8220;Big One&#8221;!</font></h2>
<p>

The Loma Prieta earthquake released only 3% of the energy of the Great 1906 quake. Although it occurred in the Santa Cruz Mountains, far from the Bay Area&#8217;s urban centers, it caused destruction not only in nearby Santa Cruz and Watsonville but also in San Francisco and Oakland:
</p>
<p>
<ul><li>
More than 60 people died, most in the collapse of the Cypress freeway structure in Oakland.
<br />
<li>
About 16,000 homes and apartment units were so badly damaged that they could no longer be lived in. The American Red Cross operated 45 shelters housing more than 6,000 people, many of them for several months.
<br />
<li>
The San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge was closed for more than a month because a portion of its eastern span collapsed. This closure and the collapse of the Cypress Freeway were the most dramatic of 142 road closures in the Bay Area.
<br />
<li>
Direct physical damage to buildings and structures totaled $6 billion; other related losses were an additional $4 billion (losses in 1989 dollars).

<i>The Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) operates a Web site designed to provide this information in the form of earthquake-shaking hazard maps at <b><a href="http://quake.abag.ca.gov/">http://quake.abag.ca.gov/</a></b>. These maps show expected shaking intensities in the Bay Area for various earthquake scenarios, such as a quake on the Peninsula segment of the San Andreas Fault or the northern Hayward Fault. These maps can be &#8220;zoomed in&#8221; to display your neighborhood.
<p>

<font color="red">Some words of caution:</font>
</p>
<p>
<ul><li>
<i>Because these hazard maps are based on general information, they are reasonably accurate for a neighborhood, but much less accurate for a particular address.

The maps in this booklet or on ABAG&#8217;s Web site are based on probabilities, so actual earthquakes could produce different damage patterns.

<h2><font color="red">Many Likely Earthquake Scenarios for the Bay Area Will Cause More Damage Than the Loma Prieta Earthquake...</font></h2>
<p>
What if the Hayward Fault in the East Bay ruptured from San Pablo Bay to Fremont in an earthquake of magnitude 6.9, like Loma Prieta?
</p>
<p>
If this scenario earthquake for the Hayward Fault occurs, areas of soft soils along the margins of San Francisco Bay, particularly in the East Bay, are likely to experience intense shaking and liquefaction. These areas are heavily urbanized and may have devastation similar to or greater than that of the area around the Cypress freeway structure in Oakland in 1989, shown below.</p>

<h2><font color="red">Your Financial Situation Could Be Affected by a Quake...</font></h2>
<p>
Aid may not be immediately available following a major disaster. Without proper planning, the financial impact of an earthquake on you and your family could be devastating. Although many things are out of your control after a quake, your ability to recover financially depends on a number of factors that you can control. Prepare and follow a financial disaster recovery plan and you will be more likely to recover successfully. Consider the following:

The primary form of disaster relief is low-interest loans to eligible individuals, homeowners, and businesses made available through the SBA to repair or replace damaged property and personal belongings not covered by insurance.

FEMA disaster grants for emergency home repairs and temporary rental assistance are only available to individuals and households who do not qualify for loans.

<h3><font color="red">What Should I Do?&#8212; <i>Follow the Seven Steps to Earthquake Safety</i></font></h3>

<h2><font color="red">The Seven Steps to Earthquake Safety...</font></h2>
<p>
Earthquakes in the Bay Area are inevitable, but damage from them is not! Steps you can take before, during, and after earthquakes will help make you and your family safer and reduce your injuries, damage, and losses:
</p>
<p>
<ul><li>
First and foremost, plan for the personal safety of you and your loved ones.
</p>
<p>
<li>
Look into the safety of your home, workplace, and child&#8217;s school&#8212;don&#8217;t be afraid to ask your landlord, boss, or school&#8217;s principal if they are aware of the hazards and have taken measures to make these places safer and more earthquake resistant.
</p>
<p>
<li>
Find out if your home, workplace, and child&#8217;s school could be subjected to seismic hazards, such as landsliding or liquefaction, in addition to strong shaking.
</p>
<p>
<li>
Don&#8217;t forget to think about likely economic impacts to you and your family from a major quake (see pages 16, 17, and 29).
</ul></p>
<p>
The seven steps described in this section will help you to be safer in earthquakes. They are arranged as measures you should take before, during, and after quakes. In addition to following the steps at home, they should also be followed at schools and workplaces. If everyone makes an effort to follow these steps, billions of dollars could be saved, injuries avoided, and many deaths averted in the next big earthquake!

<A NAME="stepone"></a>

<h2><font color="red">STEP 1&#8212;Identify Potential Hazards in Your Home and Begin to Fix Them</font></h2>
<p>
The first step to earthquake safety is to look around your home and identify all unsecured objects that might fall during shaking.
</p>
<p>
<font color="red"><b><i>START NOW</i></b></font> by moving heavy furniture, such as bookcases, away from beds, couches, and other places where people sit or sleep! Also make sure that exit paths are clear of clutter.
</p>
<p>
Simple and inexpensive things that you can do now will help reduce injuries and protect belongings in a quake. Most hardware and home-improvement stores carry earthquake-safety straps, fasteners, and adhesives that you can easily use to secure your belongings.
</p>
<p>
The following tips describe simple solutions to situations in your home that could be dangerous during earthquake shaking. If these have not yet been done in your home, take action now:
</p>
<p>
<font color="orange"><b>Check List!</b></font>
</p>
<p>
<font color="red"><b><i>Hanging objects</i></b></font>
</p>
<p align="center">

It would be difficult for an earthquake to get the wire back out of this crooked slot" border="0" width="315" height="320">
</p>
<p>
Art and other heavy objects hung on walls may fall, and glass in pictures and mirrors may shatter.
</p>
<p>
____ Place only soft art, such as unframed posters or rugs and tapestries, above beds or sofas.
<br >
____  Hang mirrors, pictures, and other hanging objects on closed hooks.
</p>
<p>
<font color="red"><b><i>Objects on open shelves and tabletops</i></b></font>

Many people think that all injuries in earthquakes are caused by collapsing buildings. Actually, most injuries in quakes are from objects that break or fall on people. For example, in the 1994 magnitude 6.7 Northridge earthquake, 55% of quake-related injuries were caused by falling objects, such as televisions, pictures and mirrors, and heavy light fixtures.

<h2><font color="red">STEP 2&#8212;Create a Disaster-Preparedness Plan</font></h2>
<p>
Will everyone in your household know how to react during and after strong earthquake shaking? To be ready for the quakes that are certain to happen in the Bay Area, it is important that your family have a disaster-preparedness plan. Hold occasional earthquake "drills" to practice your plan. Share your disaster plan with your neighbors and discuss key points with babysitters, house sitters, and house guests. Your plan should include most of the following
</p>
<p>
<font color="red"><b><i>Plan NOW to be safe during an earthquake:</i></b></font>
</p>
<p>
<font color="red"><i>In a strong earthquake, individual survival skills will be crucial.</i></font>
</p>
<p>
<ul><li>Practice &#8220;drop, cover, and hold on.&#8221; (See <A HREF="#stepfive">STEP 5</a>)
<br />
<li>
Identify safe spots in every room, such as under sturdy desks and tables.
<li>
Learn how to protect yourself no matter where you are when an earthquake strikes. (See <A HREF="#stepfive">STEP 5</a>)
<br />
</ul></p>
<p>
<font color="red"><b><i>Plan NOW to respond after an earthquake:</i></b></font>
</p>
<p>
<font color="red"><i>Doing the following will enable you to help your family and  others after a strong quake.</i></font>
<p>
<ul><li>
Keep shoes and a working flashlight next to each bed.
<br />
<li>
Teach everyone in your household to use emergency whistles and (or) to knock 3 times repeatedly if trapped. Rescuers searching collapsed buildings will be listening for sounds.
<br />
<li>
Identify the needs of household members and neighbors with special requirements or situations, such as use of a wheelchair, walking aids, special diets, or medication.
<br />
<li>
Take a Red Cross first aid and CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) training course. Learn who in your neighborhood is trained in first aid and CPR.
<br />
<li>
Know the locations of utility shutoffs and keep needed tools nearby. Know how to turn off the gas, water, and electricity to your home. Only turn off the gas if you smell or hear leaking gas.  (See <A HREF="#stepsix">STEP 6</a>)
<br />
<li>
Get training from your local fire department in how to properly use a fire extinguisher.
<br />
<li>
Install smoke alarms and test them monthly. Change the battery once a year, or sooner if the alarm emits a &ldquo;chirping&rdquo; sound (low-battery signal).
<br />
<li>
Check with your fire department to see if there is a Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) in your area. If not, ask how to start one.
</ul></p>


<p>
<font color="red"><b><i>Plan NOW to communicate and recover after an earthquake:</i></b></font>
</p>
<p>
<font color="red"><i>Don&#8217;t wait until the next earthquake to do the following.</i></font>
</p>
<p>
<ul>

<li>
Locate a safe place outside of your home for your family to meet after the shaking stops.
<br />
<li>
Establish an out-of-area contact person who can be called by everyone in the household to relay information.
<br />
<li>
Provide all family members with a list of important contact phone numbers.
<br />
<li>
Determine where you might live if your home cannot be occupied after an earthquake or other disaster (ask friends or relatives).
<br />
<li>
Learn about the earthquake plan developed by your children's school or day care, and keep your children's school emergency release cards current.
<br />
<li>
Keep copies of insurance policies, financial records, and other essential documents in a secure location, such as with your household disaster kit. Include a household inventory (a list and photos or video of your belongings).

</p>
<p>
<i>
Your family may be sleeping when the next strong quake hits the Bay Area. After the shaking stops, the lights may be out and broken glass and other dangerous debris may litter the floor, making it unsafe to walk barefoot. Keep a flashlight and a pair of sturdy shoes secured to or within reach of everyone&#8217;s bed. A good way to do this is to use a drawstring bag tied to a bedpost at the head of the bed for each occupant.

<A NAME="stepthree"></a>
<h2><font color="red">STEP 3&#8212;Create Disaster Kits</font></h2>
<p>
<font color="red"><b><i>Personal Disaster Kits</i></b></font>
</p>
<p>
Everyone in your family should have their own personal disaster kits. These kits are collections of supplies they may need when a quake strikes, no matter where they are in the Bay Area.
</p>
<p>
Personalize these kits and keep them where they can easily be reached&#8212;at home, in the car, at work or school. A backpack or other small bag is best for these kits so that they can be easily carried in an evacuation. Include the following items:
</p>
<p>
<ul><li>
Medications, a list of prescriptions, copies of medical insurance cards, doctors&rsquo; names and contact information.
<br />
<li>
Medical consent forms for dependents.
<br />
<li>
First aid kit and handbook.
<br />
<li>
Spare eyeglasses, personal hygiene supplies, and sturdy shoes
<br />
<li>
Bottled water.
<br />
<li>
Whistle (to alert rescuers to your location).
<br />
<li>
Emergency cash.
<br />
<li>
Personal identification
<br />
<li>
List of emergency contact phone numbers.
<br />
<li>
Snack foods high in calories.
<br />
<li>
Emergency lighting&mdash;light sticks and (or) a working flashlight with extra batteries and light bulbs (hand-powered flashlights are also available).
<br />
<li>
Comfort items, such as games, crayons, writing materials, and teddy bears.
</ul></p>
<p>
<font color="red">Household Disaster Kit</font>
Electrical, water, transportation, and other vital systems can be disrupted for several days after a large earthquake. Emergency response agencies and hospitals will likely be overwhelmed and unable to provide you with immediate assistance.
To help your family cope after a strong earthquake, store a household disaster kit in an easily accessible location, preferably outdoors (not in your garage). This kit, which complements your personal disaster kits, should be in a large watertight container that can be easily moved and should hold at least a 3- to 5-day supply of the following items:
<br />
<ul><li>
Drinking water (minimum one gallon per person per day).
<br />
<li>
First aid supplies, medications, and essential hygiene items, such as soap, toothpaste, and toilet paper.
<br />
<li>
Emergency lighting&#8212;light sticks and (or) a working flashlight with extra batteries and light bulbs (hand-powered flashlights are also available).
<br />
<li>
A hand-cranked or battery-operated radio (and spare  batteries).
<br />
<li>
Canned and packaged foods and cooking utensils, including a manual can opener.
<br />
<li>
Items to protect you from the elements, such as warm clothing, sturdy shoes, extra socks, blankets, and perhaps even a tent. 
<br />
<li>
Heavy-duty plastic bags for waste and to serve other uses, such as tarps and rain ponchos.
<br />
<li>
Work gloves and protective goggles.
<br />
<li>
Pet food and pet restraints.
<br />
<li>
Copies of vital documents, such as insurance policies and personal identification.
</ul></p>
<p>
<font color="red"><i>NOTE: Replace perishable items like water, food, medications, and batteries on a yearly basis.</i></font>
</p>
<p>
<font color="red"><b>A Special Note About Children</b></font>
</p>
<p>
<font color="red">Before the next earthquake</font>, spend time with your kids to discuss what might occur. Involve them in developing your disaster plan, preparing disaster supplies kits (ask them what game or toy they want to include), and practicing &#8220;drop, cover, and hold on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
<font color="red">In the days after a quake</font>, kids need extra contact and support. They may be frightened and under great stress, and aftershocks won&#8217;t let them forget the experience. Parents may have to leave children with others in order to deal with the emergency, and this can be scary. Whenever possible, include your children in the earthquake recovery process.

<h2><font color="red">STEP 4&#8212;Identify Your Building&#8217;s Potential Weaknesses and Begin to Fix Them</font></h2>
<p>
Is your house, condo, or apartment strong enough to withstand an earthquake?
</p>
<p>
<font color="red">If you live in a single-family home or duplex...</font>
</p>
<p>
You can use the quiz at right to see if your home is likely to be so badly damaged in a future quake that people might be injured or that it would be unsafe to occupy.
</p>
<p>
If your home scores 13 or more points on the quiz, you probably should have a structural engineer, architect, or contractor evaluate it unless it has been strengthened in the last few years. They will check to see if it is strong enough to keep you and your family reasonably safe in a quake. For example:
</p>
<p>
<ul><li>
Does your home have enough bolts connecting the &#8220;sill plate&#8221; to the foundation? (See below)
<br />
<li>
Is there plywood on the inside surface of the crawl space extending from the sill plate to the base of the floor joist above to prevent the wall studs from collapsing? 
<br />
<li>
Are there metal brackets connecting the rim joists to the top plates?
<br />
<li>
Is the ground floor a large open space lacking interior walls (weak or &#8220;soft&#8221; story)?
<br />
<li>
Are there large openings in the walls of the lower story, such as a garage door, that should be better braced?
<br />
<li>
Is your home a hillside house that was not adequately designed to withstand strong earthquake shaking?
</ul></p>
<p>
Once you determine if your home needs retrofitting, identify problems, prioritize how and when to fix them, and get started!
</p>
<p>
The latest recommendations of structural engineers, contractors, and city building officials who are experts on retrofitting are available on the ABAG web site at <b><a href="http://quake.abag.ca.gov/fixit/">http://quake.abag.ca.gov/fixit/</a></b>.

<p align="center">
<img src="images/fig57_and_58.jpg" alt="drawings of studs and plywood in crawlspace" border="0" width="580" height="554">
</p>
<p>
<i>
The number of foundation bolts, linear feet of plywood, and floor-to-wall connections (brackets) that are required to seismically retrofit your home varies depending on its size and weight. Remember, earthquakes will find the weak spots in your house. So, if you add bolts but not plywood, you will still have a problem when the ground shakes!

</p>
<p>
<font color="red">Structural-Safety Quiz for Single-Family Home or Duplex</font>
</p>
<p>
If you live in a single-family home or duplex, the strength of your home depends on when it was built, its style of construction, and its location.
</p>
<p>
<b>1. When was your home built?</b>
</p>
<ul><li>
Before 1960 = 5 points
<br />
<li>
1961-1978 = 3 points
<br />
<li>
After 1978 = 1 point
</ul></p>
<p>
<b>2. How tall is your home?</b>
</p>
<p>
<ul><li>
2 or more stories with living area above a garage = 5 points
Split level, on a hillside or gentle slope = 6 points
<br />
<li>
1 story, 3 or more steps up to the front door = 4 points
<br />
<li>
1 story, less than 3 steps up to the front door = 1 point
</ul></p>
<p>
<b>3. How hard is the ground likely to shake under your home?</b>
</p>
<p>
<ul><li>
Portions of the Bay Area shown as yellow or green in color on the shaking hazard map (page 8) = 5 points
<br />

Many condominiums and apartments have parking on the ground floor.  These weak or &#8220;soft&#8221; first stories may lean or collapse in an earthquake. 
</p>
<p>
Some multi-story buildings in the Bay Area can have problems because they were constructed before 1972 of concrete or brick that is inadequately reinforced. Many cities have requirements that these buildings be seismically retrofitted.  You are less likely to be killed in a retrofitted building, but you may not be able to reoccupy it after a quake.

<p>
You can reduce the chance of bricks falling through a sheetrock ceiling in a quake by putting sheets of plywood above ceiling framing. However, &#8220;retrofitting&#8221; masonry chimneys with bracing or strapping is not an effective safety measure, because they may still fall as a unit when exposed to strong shaking.

<p>
The best building code in the world does nothing for buildings built before the code was enacted. Although building codes used in California have some of the strictest seismic provisions in the world, many older buildings have not been &#8220;retrofitted&#8221; to meet updated codes. Retrofitting&#8212;fixing problems in older buildings&#8212;is the responsibility of a building&#8217;s owner.

<h2><font color="red">STEP 5&#8212;Protect Yourself During Earthquake Shaking</font></h2>
<p>
<font color="red"><b><i>&#8220;DROP, COVER, AND HOLD ON&#8221;</i></b></font>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/fig63.jpg" alt="photo of father and little boy holding onto a table leg.  A bookcase has tipped against the table and there are books scattered all over the floor." border="0" width="530" height="580">
</p>
<p>
<i>
If you are indoors, when you feel strong earthquake shaking, drop to the floor, take cover under a sturdy desk or table, and hold on to it firmly until the shaking stops.
</i>
</p>
<p>
The previous pages have concentrated on getting you ready for future earthquakes in the Bay Area, but what should you do when the shaking starts?
</p>
<p>
<font color="red"><b><i>If you are indoors...</i></b></font>
</p>
<p>
<ul><li>
&#8220;DROP, COVER, AND HOLD ON.&#8221; If you are not near a desk or table, drop to the floor against an interior wall and protect your head and neck with your arms.
<br />
<li>
Avoid exterior walls, windows, hanging objects, mirrors, tall furniture, large appliances, and cabinets filled with heavy objects.
<br />
<li>
Do not go outside until well after the shaking stops!
</ul></p>
<p>
<font color="red"><i>In bed</i></font>
</p>
<p>
Hold on and stay there, protecting your head with a pillow. You are less likely to be injured staying where you are. Broken glass on the floor can cause injuries; be sure to put shoes on before stepping on the floor (see <A HREF="#steptwo">STEP 2</a>)!
</p>
<p>
<font color="red"><i>In a high rise building</i></font>
</p>
<p>
DROP, COVER, AND HOLD ON. Avoid windows and other hazards. Do not use elevators. Do not be surprised if sprinkler systems or fire alarms activate.
</p>
<p>
<font color="red"><i>At work</i></font>
</p>
<p>
DROP, COVER, AND HOLD ON. Know your workplace&#8217;s earthquake safety plan and put it into action. When safe, move to a specified meeting location.
</p>
<p>
<font color="red"><i>In a public building or theater</i></font>
</p>
<p>
DROP, COVER, AND HOLD ON if possible. If in a theater seat, duck down and protect your head and neck with your arms. Don&#8217;t try to leave until the shaking is over. Then walk out slowly, watching for fallen debris or anything that could fall on you in aftershocks.
</p>
<p>
<font color="red"><b><i>If you are outdoors...</i></b></font>
</p>
<p>
Move to a clear area if you can safely do so; avoid buildings, powerlines, trees, and other hazards. Always assume fallen powerlines are live!
</p>
<p>
<font color="red"><i>Near tall buildings</i></font>
</p>
<p>
Windows, facades, and architectural details are often the first parts of a building to collapse. Get away from this danger zone when shaking starts. Take refuge in a safe building or an open space.
</p>
<p>
<font color="red"><i>Driving</i></font>
</p>
<p>
When able, safely pull over to the side of the road, stop, and set the parking brake. Avoid overpasses, bridges, powerlines, signs, trees, and other things that might collapse or fall on the vehicle. Stay inside the vehicle until the shaking is over. If a powerline falls on the vehicle, stay inside until a trained person removes the hazard.
</p>
<p>
<font color="red"><i>In a stadium</i></font>
</p>
<p>
Stay at your seat and protect your head and neck with your arms. Don&#8217;t try to leave until the shaking is over. Then exit slowly, avoiding debris and watching for anything that could fall in aftershocks. 
</p>
<p>
<font color="red"><i>Near the shore</i></font>
</p>
<p>
Tsunamis from local earthquakes may flood low-lying coasts within minutes of the quake. Distant, large earthquakes can produce tsunamis that may arrive hours later at California&#8217;s beaches. If you feel a strong quake, hear a tsunami warning, or notice the water suddenly withdrawing from the beach, evacuate immediately to higher ground. Tsunami waves may continue to arrive for hours, so do not return to the shore until an &#8220;all clear message&#8221; has been issued. For more tsunami survival tips go to http://pubs.usgs.gov/circ/c1187/.
</p>
<p>
<font color="red"><i>Below a dam</i></font>
</p>
<p>
Dams can fail during a major earthquake. Catastrophic failure is unlikely, but if you are downstream from a dam, you should know flood-zone information and have prepared an evacuation plan. For more information go to the Association of Bay Area Governments Web site at <b><a href="http://www.abag.ca.gov/bayarea/eqmaps/eqfloods/floods.html">http://www.abag.ca.gov/bayarea/eqmaps/eqfloods/floods.html</a></b>.

<b>Don&#8217;t be fooled!&#8212; Myth number 6</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>&#8220;HEAD FOR THE DOORWAY&#8221;</b>
</p>
<p align=center>
<img src="images/Icon_6.jpg" alt="icon depicting doorway jiggling" border="0" width="309" height="320">
</p>
<p>
In the early days of California, many homes were made of adobe bricks with wooden doorframes. After a powerful earthquake, doorframes were sometimes only parts of these houses still standing. From this came the myth that a doorway is the safest place to be during an earthquake. Today, few people in the Bay Area live in old, unreinforced adobe houses. In modern houses, doorways may be no stronger than any other part of the house and do little to protect you from falling debris. You are safer under a table, so &#8220;DROP, COVER, AND HOLD ON.&#8221;

<h2><font color="red">STEP 6&#8212;After the Quake, Check for Injuries and Damage</font></h2>
<p>
Once earthquake shaking has stopped, follow your disaster preparedness plans (see <A HREF="#steptwo">Step 2</a>). Most importantly:
</p>
<p>
<font color="red"><b><i>Check for injuries</i></b></font>
</p>
<p>
<font color="red"><i>NOTE:  The manual in your first aid kit and the front pages of your telephone book have instructions on first aid measures.</i></font>
</p>
<p>
<ul><li>
Check yourself for serious injuries before helping others. Protect your mouth, nose, and eyes from dust.
<br />
<li>
If a person is bleeding, put direct pressure on the wound. Use clean gauze or cloth, if available.
<br />
<li>
If a person is not breathing, administer rescue breathing.
<br />
<li>
If a person has no pulse, begin CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation).
<br />
<li>
Do not move seriously injured persons, unless they are in immediate danger of further harm.
<br />
<li>
Cover injured persons with blankets or additional clothing to keep them warm.
</ul></p>
<p>
<font color="red"><i><b>Check for damage causing hazardous conditions</i></b></font>
</p>
<p>
<ul><li>
<font color="red">Fire&#8212;</font>If possible, put out small fires in your home or neighborhood immediately. Call for help, but don&#8217;t wait for the fire department.
<br />
<li>
<font color="red">Gas leaks&#8212;</font>Only turn off the gas if you suspect a leak because of broken pipes or detect the odor or sound of leaking natural gas. Use a manual gas shut off wrench to close your main gas valve by turning it counterclockwise. Don&#8217;t turn gas back on by yourself&#8212;wait for the gas company! (Your telephone book has information on this topic.)
<br />
<li>
<font color="red">Damaged electrical wiring&#8212;</font>Shut off power at the main breaker switch if there is any damage to your home wiring. Leave the power off until the damage is repaired! (Your telephone book also has information on this topic.)
<br />
<li>
<font color="red">Downed utility lines&#8212;</font>If you see downed power lines, consider them energized and keep yourself and others well away from them. Never touch downed power lines or any objects in contact with them!
<br />
<li>
<font color="red">Falling items&#8212;</font>Beware of heavy items tumbling off shelves when you open closet and cupboard doors.
<br />
<li>
<font color="red">Spills&#8212;</font>Use extreme caution; when in doubt, leave your home! Spilled medicines, drugs, or other relatively non-toxic substance can be cleaned up. Potentially harmful materials, such as bleach, lye, garden chemicals, paint, and gasoline or other flammable liquids should be isolated or covered with an absorbent material, such as dirt or cat litter.
<br />
<li>
<font color="red">Damaged masonry&#8212;</font>Stay away from brick chimneys and walls. They may be weakened and could topple during aftershocks. Don&#8217;t use a fireplace with a damaged chimney, as this could start a fire or trap toxic gases in your home!
</ul></p>
<p>
<font color="red"><i><b>If your home is seriously damaged...</i></b></font>
</p>
<p>
If your home is structurally unsafe or threatened by a fire or other secondary disaster, you need to evacuate. However, shelters may be overcrowded and initially lack basic services, so do not leave home just because utilities are out of service or your home and its contents have suffered moderate damage. 
</p>
<p>
If you evacuate, tell a neighbor and your family point-of-contact where you are going. Take the following, if possible, when you evacuate:
</p>
<p>
<font color="red"><i>Bring to a shelter</i></font>
</p>
<p>
<ul><li>
Personal disaster supply kits (see <A HREF="#stepthree">STEP 3</a>).
<br />
<li>
Supply of water, food, and snacks.
<br />
<li>
Blanket, pillow, and air mattress or sleeping pad.
<br />
<li>
Change of clothing and a jacket.
<br />
<li>
Towel and washcloth.
<br />
<li>
Diapers, formula, food, and other supplies for infants.
<br />
<li>
A few family pictures or other small comfort items, such as dolls or teddy bears for children.
<br />
<li>
Personal identification and copies of household and health insurance information.
<br />
<li>
Books and games (especially for children).
</p>
<p>
<font color="red"><i>However, do not bring</i></font>
</p
<p>
<li>
Pets (service animals for people with disabilities are allowed&#8212;bring food for them).
<br />
<li>
Large quantities of unnecessary clothing or other personal items.
<br />
<li>
Valuables that might be lost, stolen, or take up needed space.

<A NAME="stepseven"></a>

<h2><font color="red">STEP 7&#8212;When Safe, Continue to Follow Your Disaster-Preparedness Plan</font></h2>
<p>
Once you have met your and your family&#8217;s immediate needs after the next strong Bay Area earthquake, continue to follow your disaster-preparedness plan (see <A HREF="#steptwo">Step 2</a>).
</p>
<p>
<font color="red"><b><i>The first days after the earthquake. . .</i></b></font>
</p>
<p>
In the days following a damaging quake,  pay special attention to the following:
</p>
<p>
<font color="red"><i>Safety first</i></font>
</p>
<p>
Do not reenter your home until you know it is safe.
<br />
<ul><li>
Be sure there are no gas leaks at your home before using open flames (lighters, matches, candles, or grills) or operating any electrical or mechanical device that could create a spark (light switches, generators, chain saws, or motor vehicles).
<br />
<li>
Check for chemical spills, faulty electrical wiring, and broken water lines. Water in contact with faulty wiring is a shock hazard.
<br />
<li>
Unplug broken or toppled light fixtures or appliances. These could start fires when electricity is restored.
<br />
<li>
Never use the following indoors: camp stoves, kerosene or gas lanterns or heaters, gas or charcoal grills, or gas generators, as these can release deadly carbon monoxide gas or be a fire hazard in aftershocks. 
</ul></p>
<p>
<font color="red"><i>Be in communication</i></font>
</p>
<p>
<ul><li>
<b>Turn on your portable or car radio and listen for information and safety advisories.</b>
<br />
<li>
Place all phones back on their cradles.
<br />
<li>
Call your out-of-area contact, tell them your status, and then stay off the phone&#8212;emergency responders need the phone lines for life-saving communications.
<br />
<li>
Check on your neighbors.
</ul></p>
<p>
<font color="red"><i>Check your food and water supplies</i></font>
</p>
<p>
<ul><li>
If power is off, plan meals so as to use up refrigerated and frozen foods first. If you keep the door closed, food in your freezer may be good for a couple of days.
<br />
<li>
If your water is off, you can drink from water heaters, melted ice cubes, or canned vegetables. Avoid drinking the water from swimming pools or hot tubs; use it to fight fires.
</ul></p>
<p>
<font color="red"><b><i>The first weeks after the earthquake. . .</b></i></font>
</p>
<p>
This is a time of transition. Although aftershocks may continue, you will now work toward getting your life, your home and family, and your routines back in order. Emotional care and recovery are just as important as healing physical injuries and rebuilding a home. Make sure your home is safe to occupy and not in danger of collapse in aftershocks. If you were able to remain in your home or return to it after a few days, you will have a variety of tasks to accomplish while reestablishing routines:
</p>
<p>
<font color="red"><i>Tasks</i></font>
</p>
<p>
<ul><li>
If your gas was turned off, you will need to arrange for the gas company to turn it back on.
<br />
<li>
If the electricity went off and then came back on, check your appliances or electronic equipment for damage.
<br />
<li>
If water lines broke, look for water damage.
<br />
<li>
Locate or replace critical documents that may have been misplaced, damaged, or destroyed.
<br />
<li>
Contact your insurance agent or company right away to begin your claims process. 
<br />
<li>
Contact the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to find out about financial assistance (see <A HREF="#fema">FEMA information</a>).
<br />
<li>
If you cannot live at your home, set up an alternative mailing address with the post office.
</ul></p>
<p>
<font color="red"><b><i>If you cannot stay in your home...</i></b></font>
</p>
<p>
The American Red Cross (ARC) offers immediate emergency assistance with housing needs. ARC also supports shelter operations prior to a Presidential declaration of a Federal disaster. 
</p>
<p>
Once a Presidential declaration has been issued, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) may activate the &#8220;Assistance for Individuals and Households Program.&#8221; This program includes: 
</p>
<p>
<ul><li>
Home-repair cash grants; the maximum of Federal grant available is $26,200.
<br />
<li>
Housing Assistance in the form of reimbursement for short-term lodging expenses at a hotel or motel.
<br />
<li>
Rental assistance for as long as 18 months in the form of cash payment for a temporary rental unit or a manufactured home. 
<br />
<li>
If no other housing is available, FEMA may provide mobile homes or other temporary housing.

<p>
Many people wrongly believe that the U.S. Government will take care of all their financial needs if they suffer losses in an earthquake.  The truth is that Federal disaster assistance is only available if the President formally declares a disaster. Even if you do get disaster assistance, it is usually a loan that you must repay, with interest, in addition to mortgages and other financial obligations you still owe, even on damaged property. If you don&#8217;t qualify for loans, grants may be available to you. However, these are only designed to meet your most immediate needs, not to replace your losses (see <A HREF="#finance">Finance section</a>).

After an earthquake, knowing more about what just happened can reduce fears and help you understand what to expect next. Online earthquake information products include:
</p>
<p>
<font color="orange"><b><i>Location and magnitude of recent earthquakes</i></b></font>
</p>
<p>
Within 1 to 2 minutes of an earthquake, its location and magnitude are available at several Web sites, including

</p>
<p>

Within 5 to 10 minutes of most felt earthquakes (magnitude 3.5 and greater) in the Bay Area, a &#8220;ShakeMap&#8221; is posted on the Web. This map shows the range of shaking intensities across a region. Every quake has only a single magnitude, but it produces a range of shaking intensity values over the area in which it is felt.
</p>
<p>
ShakeMaps use data from seismic instruments to provide a rapid picture of where the strongest shaking occurred. These maps help to identify areas where a quake&#8217;s impact is greatest and are used by emergency managers to speed disaster response. ShakeMaps are available at

<p>
When you fill out this online survey, your observations of actual damage and shaking are combined with those of thousands of other people. The quake&#8217;s shaking intensities, derived from these observations, are displayed by ZIP code on a &#8220;Community Internet Intensity Map.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
<font color="red"><b><i>Who monitors California&#8217;s earthquakes?</i></b></font>

<h3><font color="orange">Glossary</font></h3>
<p>
<font color="orange"><b>Aftershock.</b></font> Earthquakes that follow the largest shock of an earthquake sequence. They are smaller than the &#8220;mainshock&#8221; and can occur over a period of weeks, months, or years. In general, the larger the mainshock, the larger and more numerous the aftershocks and the longer they will continue.
</p>
<p>
<font color="orange"><b>Creep. </b></font>Slow, more or less continuous movement occurring on some faults. Creep does not cause shaking.
</p>
<p>
<font color="orange"><b>Earthquake. </b></font>Ground shaking caused by a sudden movement on a fault or by volcanic disturbance.
</p>
<p>
<font color="orange"><b>Epicenter. </b></font>The point on the Earth&#8217;s surface above the point at depth in the Earth&#8217;s crust where an earthquake begins.
</p>
<p>
<font color="orange"><b>Fault. </b></font>A fracture or crack along which two blocks of rock slide past one another. This movement may occur rapidly, in the form of an earthquake, or slowly, in the form of creep.
</p>
<p>
<font color="orange"><b>Foreshock. </b></font>An earthquake that precedes the largest quake (&#8220;mainshock&#8221;) of an earthquake sequence. Foreshocks may occur seconds to weeks before the mainshock.
</p>
<p>
<font color="orange"><b>Intensity. </b></font>A measure of ground shaking describing the local severity of an earthquake in terms of its effects on the Earth&#8217;s surface and on humans and their structures. The Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) scale, which uses Roman numerals, is one way scientists measure intensity.
</p>
<p>
<font color="orange"><b>Landslide. </b></font>A mass movement of soil, mud, and (or) rock down a slope.
</p>
<p>
<font color="orange"><b>Liquefaction. </b></font>The process that occurs when an earthquake shakes wet sandy soil until it behaves like a liquid, allowing sand to &#8220;boil up&#8221; to the surface, buildings to sink, or sloping ground to move. 
</p>
<p>
<font color="orange"><b>Magnitude (M).</b></font> A number that represents the size of an earthquake source, as determined from seismographic observations. The original earthquake magnitude scale was the Richter or &#8220;local&#8221; scale (ML), defined by Charles Richter in 1935, but it has limited range and applicability. Modern magnitude scales are based on the area of fault rupture times the amount of slip (seismic moment).The moment magnitude (MW) is the preferred magnitude scale, as it provides the most reliable estimate of the size of the largest quakes. For smaller quakes, ML and MW values are nearly the same. An increase of one unit of moment magnitude (for example, from 4.6 to 5.6) corresponds approximately to a 31.6-fold increase in energy released [by definition, a two-unit increase in magnitude &#8212;for example, from 4.7 to 6.7&#8212;represents an increase in energy released of 1,000 times (31.6_31.6)]. Quakes below magnitude 2.5 are not generally felt by humans.
</p>
<p>
<font color="orange"><b>Plate tectonics. </b></font>The scientific theory that the Earth&#8217;s outer shell is composed of several large, thin, relatively strong &#8220;plates&#8221; that move  relative to one another. Movements on the faults that define plate boundaries produce most earthquakes.
</p>
<p>
<font color="orange"><b>Retrofit.</b></font> Strengthening an existing structure to improve its resistance to the effects of earthquakes.
</p>
<p>
<font color="orange"><b>Rupture zone. </b></font>The area of the Earth through which fault movement occurred during an earthquake. For large quakes, the section of the fault that ruptured may be several hundred miles in length. Ruptures may or may not extend to the ground surface.
</p>
<p>
<font color="orange"><b>Seismic hazard.</b></font> The potential for damaging effects caused by earthquakes. The level of hazard depends on the magnitude of likely quakes, the distance from the fault that could cause quakes, and the type of ground materials at a site.
</p>
<p>
<font color="orange"><b>Seismic risk. </b></font>The chance of injury, damage, or loss resulting from seismic hazards. There is no risk, even in a region of high seismic hazard, if there are no people or property that could be injured or damaged by a quake.
</p>
<p>
<font color="orange"><b>Soft story. </b></font>A building story that has significantly less stiffness than the story above. Some buildings with parking at ground level (and thus fewer walls or columns) or an otherwise open ground story have this condition. The term is sometimes also applied to a story that has less strength than the one above, a condition that is more precisely termed a &#8220;weak story.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
<font color="orange"><b>Strike-slip fault. </b></font>A generally vertical fault along which the two sides move horizontally past each other. The most famous example is California&#8217;s San Andreas Fault.
</p>
<p>
<font color="orange"><b>Subduction zone.</b></font> A boundary along which one plate of the Earth&#8217;s outer shell descends (subducts) at an angle beneath another.  A subduction zone is usually marked by a deep trench on the sea floor. An example is the Cascadia Subduction Zone offshore of Washington, Oregon, and northern California. Most tsunamis are generated by subduction-zone earthquakes.
</p>
<p>
<font color="orange"><b>Tsunami.</b></font> A sea wave of local or distant origin that results from large sea-floor displacements associated with powerful earthquakes, major submarine landslides, or exploding volcanic islands.
