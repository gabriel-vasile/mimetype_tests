Part XVIII--Proposed New Industry Structure for Primary Metal Manufacturing

Section A--NAICS Structure

North American Industry Classification System

(NAICS)

Agreement Number 29

  This Document represents the proposed agreement on the structure of the North American
Industry Classification System (NAICS) for the following industry:
Primary Metal Manufacturing  
  The detailed NAICS structure along with a brief description of the structure is attached
(Attachments 1 and 2).  Each country agrees to release a copy of the proposed NAICS structure
to interested data users.  Comments received will be shared among the countries and additional
discussions will be held before a final decision on the structure is made.  Each country may add
additional detailed industries, below the 4-digit level of NAICS, as necessary to meet national
needs, so long as this additional detail aggregates to a 4-digit NAICS level in order to ensure full
comparability among the three countries.  This NAICS structure was presented and provisionally
accepted at the NAICS Committee meeting held on November 8 and November 9, 1995 in
Washington, D.C.

Attachment 2--North American Industry Classification System  

Draft Classification for:
     Primary Metal Manufacturing

     Representatives of the statistical agencies of Canada, Mexico and the United States agree to a
draft industry classification for these industries
  The draft classification provides for the subsector, Primary Metal Manufacturing.  This
subsector is divided into five industry groups and nine industries.  The subsector is part of the
Manufacturing sector.
  
A General Outline

  The Primary Metal Manufacturing industries are well defined and include the production of
steel and steel products; the smelting, refining, and rolling of nonferrous metals; and the
production of metal castings.  The processes employed in these industries include the use of blast
furnaces to produce iron, and the use of basic oxygen and other steel making furnaces to produce 
steel. Rolling, drawing, and extruding processes to produce such products as pipe and tube, wire,
and sheet are also used in this subsector.  Similar processes are used to produce the nonferrous
metal and metal products also included in this subsector.
  A structure along the lines of function or process ( refining and smelting, or rolling, drawing,
and extruding) for all metals was considered for this subsector.  It was not adopted, because: (1)
the processes, although they have some similarity, are clearly distinct for steel versus nonferrous
metals.  Within nonferrous metal manufacturing, the processes are also different.  For example,
the primary reduction of aluminum involves the massive use of electricity, where the primary
reduction of copper is accomplished by using heat and chemicals;  (2) establishments that roll,
draw or extrude are highly specialized by type of nonferrous metal;  (3) due to the combination
of process activities in aluminum manufacture in Mexico, a separate trilateral NAICS industry
could not be created that would split primary aluminum from aluminum, rolling, drawing, and
extrusion.  For this reason, a separate NAICS 3-digit and 4-digit industry group and industry was
created for Smelting, Refining, Rolling, Drawing and Extruding Aluminum, and a 3-digit
NAICS group, Smelting, Refining, Rolling, Drawing, and Extruding of Other Nonferrous Metal,
that parallels the 3-digit structure for Aluminum. The "Other" nonferrous group, however,
contains 4-digit levels for process industries for copper and for nonferrous metals, except
aluminum and copper.
  The Iron and Steel Mills and Ferroalloy Manufacturing industry group comprises
establishments that produce steel products, beginning with the treatment of iron ore, using
furnaces or direct reduction techniques and establishments that begin their process with the
purchase of iron, pig iron, or scrap.  Establishments that produce ferroalloys are also included in
this subsector.  Establishments classified in the NAICS industry Rolling and Drawing of
Purchased Steel produce sheet and plate, pipe and tube, and wire drawn from purchased steel. 
The subsector also includes establishments that produce wire rods, bars, plates, sheet, wire, from
purchased primary shapes.
  The Smelting, Refining, Rolling, Drawing, and Extruding of Aluminum and Other
Nonferrous Metal industry groups include establishments that produce primary nonferrous
metals and those that produce nonferrous metal products such as sheet, foil, shapes, etc..

Limitations and Constraints of the Classification

  In the Primary Metal Manufacturing subsector, most activities that were identified in one
country exist in the others.  However, the combination of activities within establishments varied
across the three countries resulting in higher aggregations of some NAICS industries.  For
example, broad NAICS classes were created for nonferrous castings, due to production overlap
in Mexico.  Similarly, often an activity is not economically significant to the same degree in all
countries.  For example, a separate  NAICS industry cannot be created for the smelting and
refining of copper, because the resulting industries are too small in Canada.
  Each country may publish additional national industries that comprise subdivisions of
NAICS industries, to present data for activities that are nationally significant.  For those users
requiring detailed commodity information, each country will publish information on the products
of these industries.  Efforts are also underway to harmonize the commodity classifications to
allow for greater comparability of these statistics.  

Relationship to ISIC

  Each of the NAICS industries created in this subsector can be assigned without any
subdivision to Division 27, Manufacture of Basic Metals, of  the current International Standard
Industrial Classification of all Economic Activities (ISIC Revision 3) of the United Nations.  The
movement of steel and nonferrous wire drawing (CSIC's 3052 & 3381),  and precious metal
refining (CSIC 3922), for Canada; of  molding of metal castings (CMAP 381100) for Mexico;
and of the production of alumina (1987 SIC 2819 pt),  for the United States are all changes that
enhance the NAICS/ISIC relationship.  This means that one can combine the industries of this
subsector and be comparable to ISIC Division 27.

Some Changes to the National Classifications

  For Canada, an important improvement for both production precepts and for international
comparability was the movement of ferrous and nonferrous wire drawing to this subsector from
other areas.  Smelting and refining of precious metals was moved for the same reasons.  Other
changes for Canada were internal to the existing subsector structure.  These changes generally 
involved realignment of industries to achieve three country comparability, as well as to better
meet the production process principle.  Some examples are the split of the Other Primary Steel
industry to match the NAICS industries for Iron and Steel Mills and Ferroalloy Manufacturing
and Rolling and Drawing of Purchased Steel, and the separation of various types of castings
from other ferrous or nonferrous manufacturing to match agreed upon NAICS classes. 
  For Mexico, the only structural modification was to move the production of ferrous and
nonferrous castings from the current CMAP classes for machinery.  This change allows for three
country comparability, and improves the production definition of this subsector.  Other changes
are internal to the existing Mexican structure, but like those made for Canada above, they were
made to both achieve an international NAICS level, while at the same time, they are sound
production industry moves.  An example is splitting the production of rods and structural shapes,
pipe and tube  and wire made in a steel making facility from those made from purchased primary
steel shapes.  
  In the United States, a significant structural change was to move the production of alumina
from the Chemical Product Manufacturing subsector.  This change both matches the Canadian
and Mexican treatment, and groups the basic reduction of this ore with  metal manufacturing
rather than in a chemical processing group.  Other changes entailed the realignment of internal
nonferrous smelting, rolling and drawing, mostly to achieve three country compatibility.

Achievement of Objectives

  The classification meets the objectives for the North American Industry Classification
System.  It includes industries that group establishments with similar production processes, that
is, it applies the production-oriented economic concept.  The hierarchical structure of the
classification also follows the production concept.
  The classification achieves comparability for the three participating countries.  Based on
existing data, all three countries expect to be able to publish data regularly at the industry (4-digit) level of the structure.  All countries agree on the definitions of industries.  
  Other objectives of the NAICS project are not as relevant in this area of the classification as
in others.  These objectives are the delineation of new and emerging industries, service industries
and industries engaged in the production of advanced technologies.  The industrial sector in
question is relatively mature, generally produces goods and employs relatively stable
technology.  Therefore, the emphasis is on the objectives listed above.  
  The industries have high specialization ratios, and they are economically significant.  The
classification is suitable for sampling, data-publishing, and other aspects of survey operations.

Section B-Annex: United States National Industry Detail

  As explained in the Structure presentation of this notice, for a number of reasons 4-digit
industries in the NAICS industry subsector presented in Part XIX, Section A--Attachment 1,
contain less detail than is currently in the U.S. SIC system, and less detail than is required to
meet important analytical requirements in the U.S.  The three country agreement on NAICS
envisions that each country may develop national detailed industries below the NAICS industry
level, so long as the national detail can be aggregated to the NAICS classification, thus assuring
full North American comparability.
  The ECPC is proposing U.S. 5-digit industry detail for the NAICS industry subsector
covered in Part XIX of this notice.  For cases where no 5-digit detail is shown, the ECPC is
proposing that the NAICS 4-digit industries will also represent the most detailed U.S. industries.                                              TABLE 1

The definitions of status codes are as follows: E-existing industry; N-new industry; R-revised industry; and * means "part of". The abbreviation NEC is used for Not Elsewhere Classified.

     Description of Changes to the U.S. System
     
        A number of the changes listed in this section were made for reasons of
     international comparability.  Where one or more of the three North American countries
     had different definitions of an industry classification, adjustments to the definitions in
     one or more countries were required.  In constructing NAICS, the three countries
     agreed to move, where change was required to attain international comparability, in the
     direction of the country or countries whose existing classification definitions most
     closely corresponded to the production-oriented concept adopted for NAICS.  Cases
     where the U.S. changed are listed below; other cases where Canada or Mexico moved
     toward the U.S. classification are not, of course, listed in this section. 
        Four new industries were added to the 1997 industry structure for this industry
     subsector.  New industries were created for:
        Iron and Steel Mills, from 1987 SIC 3312, Steel Works, Blast Furnaces, and
     Rolling Mills, and part of 1987 SIC 3399, Primary Metal Products, NEC, for
     comparability with Canada and Mexico, and because the production processes include
     direct reduction and other furnace processes similar to those used in manufacturing
     steel. 
        Secondary Smelting of Aluminum from part of 1987 SIC 3341, Secondary
     Smelting and Refining of Nonferrous Metals, and part of 1987 SIC 3399, Primary
     Metal Products, NEC, because of specialized production processes involved, and for
     international comparability. 
        Alumina Manufacturing from part of 1987 SIC 2819, Industrial Inorganic
     Chemicals, in the 1987 Major Group 28, Chemicals and Allied Products, to achieve
     international comparability.  Canada has this in CSIC 2951, Primary Production of
     Aluminum.
        Drawing of Copper Wire from part of 1987 SIC 3357, Drawing and Insulating of
     Nonferrous Wire, for international comparability, and because it is a specialized
     production process.
        One complete industry was transferred out of 1987 Major Group 33, Primary
     Metals.
        Metal Heat Treating was transferred into the 1997 subsector Fabricated Metal
     Product Manufacturing. The move improves the production process classification for
     this activity. 
        Five activities were transferred out of 1987 Major Group 33, Primary Metals, and
     are described more fully in their new respective NAICS subsectors.
        Nails, spikes, paper clips, and wire, not made in wire drawing plants, were
     transferred from 1987 SIC 3315, Steel Wiredrawing and Steel Nails and Spikes, into
     Miscellaneous Fabricated Wire Product Manufacturing in the 1997 subsector
     Fabricated Metal Product Manufacturing.
        Communication and energy wire - insulating only, was transferred from 1987 SIC
     3357, Drawing and Insulating of Nonferrous Wire, into Communication and Energy
     Wire Manufacturing in 1997 subsector Electrical Equipment, Appliance and
     Component Manufacturing.
            Nonferrous nails, brads, staples, etc. were transferred from 1987 SIC 3399, Primary
     Metal Products, NEC, into Miscellaneous Fabricated Wire Product Manufacturing in
