<P>DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY</P>
<P>OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS</P>
<P>Opinion of the Director</P>
<P>Name of Case:  Albuquerque Operations Office</P>
<P>Date of Filing: September 27, 1996</P>
<P>Case Number:  VSA-0084</P>
<P>This Opinion considers a Request for Review filed by XXXXXX (hereinafter &quot;the
individual&quot;) concerning his eligibility to retain an access authorization
under the regulations set forth at 10 C.F.R. Part 710, entitled &quot;Criteria
and Procedures for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Matter or
Special Nuclear Material.&quot;  &lt;1&gt;The individual's access authorization
was suspended at the direction of the Manager of DOE's XXXXX Operations Office
(DOE/XXXXX).  The individual requested an administrative review of this action
before a Hearing Officer, and on August 23, 1996, the Hearing Officer assigned
by the DOE Office of Hearings and Appeals issued an Opinion recommending that
the individual's access authorization should not be restored.  On September 27,
1996, the individual filed a Request for Review of the Hearing Officer's Opinion
pursuant to 10 C.F.R. &#167; 710.28.  10 C.F.R. &#167;710.28(a).  On October 11,
1996, he filed a Statement setting forth the issues on which he wishes the
Director of the Office of Hearings to focus (Statement of Issues).  10 C.F.R. &#167;710.28(b).
 On October 30, 1996, the Director, Office of Safeguards and Security (OSS)
filed a response to the Request for </P>
<P>Review, indicating that his Office did not wish to submit additional
comments in this proceeding.  10 C.F.R. &#167; 710.28(b).  This Opinion
considers the issues raised by the Statement of Issues.  </P>
<P>I.  BACKGROUND </P>
<P>The facts in this case, as found by the Hearing Officer, are as follows.  On
February 11, 1993, the individual was arrested and charged with Criminal
Trespass for peeping into a female neighbor's window on February 3, 1993.  On
February 25, 1993, he was arrested for Indecent Exposure, which occurred when he
exposed himself to that woman on September 14, 1992, and for an additional
Criminal Trespass involving a February 3, 1993 peeping incident.  The individual
promptly reported these arrests to DOE/XXXXX's Personnel Security Division,
which took no action at that time to suspend his access authorization.  On
February 2, 1995, he was arrested again for Criminal Trespass, which occurred on
January 8, 1995.  In this instance, the individual is alleged to have peeped
into the same woman's window. The individual promptly reported the 1995 arrest
to the DOE/XXXXX.  The individual pled guilty to one of the charges arising out
of the February  3, 1993 incident, and the other charges were dropped after he
agreed to participate in a pre-trial diversion program, which commenced on May
15, 1995, and concluded on May 15, 1996. </P>
<P>In addition to the arrests for sex offenses committed in 1992, 1993 and
1995, during a Personnel Security Interview (PSI) conducted on February 22,
1995, the individual acknowledged that he was arrested in October 1985 for
Indecent Exposure and had plea bargained to reduce this charge to Disorderly
Conduct, for which he paid a $20 fine. On August 16, 1995, the individual was
evaluated by a DOE- consultant psychiatrist.  In his report, the DOE
psychiatrist found that the individual has two mental conditions, voyeurism and
exhibitionism.&lt;2&gt;  He opined that &quot;It is more likely than not that
[the individual] will reoffend and engage in either Voyeurism and Exhibitionism
again.&quot; The DOE psychiatrist also found that &quot;[the individual] would
be subject to blackmail were he to reoffend and a neighbor threatened to tell
authorities.&quot; DOE Exhibit 12 at 47.  </P>
<P>   </P>
<P>The DOE/XXXXX issued a Notification Letter to the individual which charged
under 10 C.F.R. &#167; 710.8(h) (Criterion H) that the individual has two
illnesses or mental conditions--voyeurism and exhibitionism--of a nature which
in the opinion of a board- certified psychiatrist, cause, or may cause, a
significant defect in his judgment or reliability.  The Notification Letter also
charged under 10 C.F.R. &#167; 710.8(l) (Criterion L) that in view of his
arrests for sex offenses, the individual has engaged in unusual conduct or is
subject to circumstances which tend to show that he is not honest, reliable, or
trustworthy; or which furnishes reason to believe that he may be subject to
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress which may cause him to act contrary
to the best interests of the national security.</P>
<P>The individual filed a request for a hearing on these charges. At the
hearing, the individual was represented by an attorney.  The individual
testified on his own behalf, and he called ten other witnesses, including his
wife, a number of his co-workers, the psychotherapist who has treated him for
voyeurism and exhibitionism, and officials from the DOE's Personnel Assurance
Program.  DOE/XXXXX presented nine witnesses at the hearing, including the
complaining witnesses who reported the individual's offenses, the investigating
police officer, the DOE psychiatrist, a DOE contractor-polygraph expert, and two
DOE personnel security specialists.  </P>
<P>A. Criterion H </P>
<P>Derogatory information that falls within Criterion H includes an illness or
mental condition of a nature which in the opinion of a board-certified
psychiatrist may cause a significant defect in judgment or reliability.  The
individual admitted at the hearing that he has the mental conditions described
in the Notification Letter, exhibitionism and voyeurism, and he accepts
responsibility for the peeping and exhibitionism incidents that occurred in 1992
and 1993.  According to the individual, he realized that he was in danger of
losing his job, his marriage and his family, and began individual psychotherapy
and took other steps to turn his life around, such as destroying his pornography
and returning to his church.  As a result of these actions, the individual
claimed that his marital relationship has significantly improved, and that he
has been rehabilitated.</P>
<P>While he admitted responsibility for the actions which led to his arrests in
February 1993, the individual denied that he exposed himself to a woman from his
garage in October 1985, the purported act that led to his first arrest for
Indecent Exposure.  He also denied that he committed the Criminal Trespass on
January 8, 1995, for which he was later arrested.  He offered alibi evidence to
show he was not present at the scene of that incident, and he insists that he
has been wrongly identified as the man who was peeping in a neighbor's window on
that night. </P>
<P>Before the hearing, the individual took a polygraph examination at his
lawyer's suggestion to prove that he was not involved in the 1995 peeping
incident, but the test format was defective and key records were lost, so that
this first polygraph does not provide any useful evidence. At the hearing on May
9, 1996, the individual offered again to take an exculpatory polygraph
examination, conducted by DOE contractors.  The DOE/XXXXX was agreeable, and the
record was kept open after the hearing while the DOE Counsel and the
individual's attorney attempted to make arrangements for the individual to take
a polygraph.  But the individual was unable to obtain clearance from his
personal physicians who are currently treating him with chemotherapy for cancer,
and DOE/XXXXX would not subject the individual to an exculpatory polygraph
without medical authorization. </P>
<P>At the hearing, the individual's therapist (who is a psychiatric social
worker) and the DOE psychiatrist both testified about the individual's mental
condition.  His personal therapist stated that in addition to exhibitionism and
voyeurism, the individual has &quot;a blending of schizoid personality disorder
with narcissistic personality disorder.&quot;  While conceding that persons with
exhibitionism and voyeurism often reoffend, he stated that he thought the
individual was rehabilitated.  Transcript of Hearing (hereinafter Tr.) at 242.
</P>
<P>The DOE psychiatrist concluded that although the individual may be
rehabilitated &quot;to some extent,&quot; he feared that &quot;it's to the wrong
extent in that he has grasped on to something that, even though it may be
helpful, it's not really the best way to treat this sort of problem.&quot;  Tr.
at 323.  Based on his experience treating persons with these sexual behaviors,
the DOE psychiatrist opined that the individual was more likely than not to &quot;exhibit
a very narrowly circumscribed defect in judgment,&quot; and to &quot;reengage in
that kind of behavior at some point in the future.&quot;  Tr. at 324-325; 333. 
However, the DOE psychiatrist agreed with several other witnesses who testified
at the hearing that the individual's judgment, reliability and safety in the
workplace were not affected by his sexual behavior off the job.  Id. at 338-340.
 </P>
<P>     </P>
<P>After considering the evidence in the record, the Hearing Officer found that
Notification Letter properly invoked the provisions of Criterion H.  The Hearing
Officer found that the individual had failed to come forward with evidence
showing that he was not involved in the January 1995 peeping incident.  He noted
the many witnesses at the hearing who testified about the individual's history
of peeping in the victim's window.  He stated that the only alibi testimony
comes from the individual's wife, who said that she checked on him in the hot
tub every ten minutes.  He found that it was physically possible for the
individual to get from his house to the victim's house in a short time,
estimated by various witnesses as no longer than five minutes.  Finally, he
determined that even without the 1995 incident, there was still enough evidence
in the record to support the Notification Letter's charge under Criterion H.  &lt;3&gt;</P>
<P>With respect to the question of rehabilitation, the Hearing Officer
considered the testimony of both the individual's therapist and the DOE
psychiatrist, both of whom are experienced in treating individuals with
exhibitionism and voyeurism.  Both witnesses agreed that persons with those
illnesses are caught only in a small percentage of the times in which they
engage in those behaviors, and that the behaviors tend to be chronic so that
many exhibitionists and voyeurs will reoffend.  The Hearing Officer noted that
they differ in their assessments of the individual's condition.  The
individual's therapist attributed greater significance to the individual's
marital problems, and stated that the individual has made progress toward
rehabilitation.  The therapist admitted that he did not know whether the
individual was telling the truth about his involvement in the 1995 peeping
incident, and he was not certain that the individual would not engage in
exhibitionism or voyeurism in the future.  The Hearing Officer pointed out that
the DOE psychiatrist had a differing opinion about the origins of the
individual's behavior, and consequently, more doubts about the efficacy of the
individual's treatment.  Although he was uncertain about whether the individual
would be able to control his exhibitionism and voyeurism in the future, the DOE
psychiatrist believed that the individual was still in denial, and more likely
than not to reoffend.   After considering the testimony of the individual's
therapist and the DOE psychiatrist, the Hearing Officer was not convinced that
the individual, a man with a ten year history of arrests for exhibitionism and
voyeurism, was rehabilitated. </P>
<P>B. Criterion L</P>
<P>The Notification Letter also raised a security concern pertaining to
Criterion L, which in relevant part includes information that an individual
engaged in any unusual conduct which furnishes reason to believe that he may be
subject to pressure, coercion, or exploitation, which may cause him to act
contrary to the best interests of the national security.   The security concern
under Criterion L is that engaging in exhibitionism and voyeurism could make the
individual susceptible to pressure, coercion, exploitation and duress.  </P>
<P>The individual maintained that his conduct after his recent arrests shows
that he is not susceptible to blackmail.  Tr. at 263-264; 278-280.  The Hearing
Officer recognized that the individual has promptly reported all of his recent
arrests to DOE/XXXXX, even though the information was embarrassing, and he knew
that it might subject his access authorization to review and possible
revocation.  Nevertheless, the Hearing Officer found that the psychiatric
evidence discussed above suggests that there is a substantial risk that the
individual might engage again in those behaviors.  Since future incidents would
jeopardize his security clearance and his job, it is possible that the
individual would be vulnerable to pressure from someone who threatened to report
his sexual misconduct to the authorities.  The Hearing Officer found that the
risk of exploitation is much greater for this individual than for a person
without his mental condition.  It was the Hearing Officer's opinion that this
individual's access authorization should not be restored because there is an
unacceptably high degree of risk that he would to be subject to exploitation. He
therefore concluded that the individual has failed to show that restoring his
access authorization would not endanger the common defense and security and
would be clearly consistent with the national interest.  Accordingly, he
recommended that the individual's access authorization not be restored.</P>
<P>II.  ANALYSIS</P>
<P>A. Standard of Review</P>
<P>As a general rule, findings of fact in these types of cases will not be set
aside unless they are clearly erroneous, giving due regard to the fact that the
trier of fact is in the best position to judge the credibility of witnesses. 
Compare, Pullman-Standard v. Swint, 456 U.S. 273 (1982) (Pullman) with Amadeo v.
Zant, 486 U.S. 214, 223 (1988)(Amadeo), quoting Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
52(a).  See also, <A HREF="/cases/whistle/ds0006.htm">Helen Gaidine Oglesbee v.
Westinghouse Hanford Company</A>, 25 DOE &#182; 89,001 (1995).  Findings not
supported by substantial evidence are taken to be clearly erroneous.  Freeport
Sulphur Co. v. S/S Hermosa, 526 F.2d 300 (5th Cir. 1976).  Substantial evidence
means &quot;such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate
to support a conclusion.&quot;  Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U.S. 552 (1988).  A
finding is considered clearly erroneous when, although there is evidence to
support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite
and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.  U.S. v. United States
Gypsum Co., 333 U.S. 364, 395 (1948). 
</P>
<P>In personnel security cases under Part 710, it is the role of the Hearing
Officer to issue an Opinion as to whether granting an access authorization would
not endanger the common defense and security and would be clearly consistent
with the national interest.  10 C.F.R. &#167; 710.27(a).  Thus, in reviewing the
Hearing Officer's Opinion in this case, I must assess whether there is
substantial evidence to support his finding that granting an access
authorization to this individual would endanger the common defense and security
and would not be clearly consistent with the national interest.  </P>
<P>After reviewing the entire record in this case, I find that both the record
and the Hearing Officer's Opinion contain substantial evidence that restoring
this individual's access authorization would not be clearly consistent with the
national interest.  As discussed fully below, I find no basis for the
individual's assertions that the Hearing Officer's conclusions are incorrect or
without foundation.  I now turn to the specific evidence in this case and the
Statement of Issues at hand. </P>
<P>B.  Statement of Issues</P>
<P>The individual first argues that the Hearing Officer improperly accepted the
conclusion of the DOE psychiatrist that the individual was not rehabilitated. 
In this regard he states that the Hearing Officer gave too much weight to the
DOE psychiatrist's opinion and did not give enough deference to other
psychiatric personnel who worked with the individual.  The individual maintains
that the DOE psychiatrist's opinion was not based on any facts, and was not
based on long term observation of the individual.  </P>
<P>The Hearing Officer is responsible for considering the demeanor and
credibility of witnesses.  10 C.F.R. &#167; 710.27(b).  He also assesses the
appropriate weight to be given to their testimony. 
<A HREF="/cases/security/vsa0014.htm">Personnel Security Review</A> (Case No.
VSA-0014), 25 DOE &#182; 83,002 at 86,512.  Absent some error, I will not
supplant my judgment for that of the Hearing Officer in such matters. 
<A HREF="/cases/security/vsa0049.htm">Personnel Security Review</A> (Case No.
VSA-0049), 25 DOE &#182; 83,011 (1996).  </P>
<P>In the present case, I see no error in the weight that the Hearing Officer
gave to the DOE psychiatrist's testimony.  The individual claims that the DOE
psychiatrist's opinion was not based on any facts, and that the opinion was not
based on the individual personally or based on his particular case.  I do not
agree.  As is clear from the record in this case, the DOE psychiatrist conducted
a two and one-half hour interview with the individual, and read the individual's
DOE personnel security file.  Tr. at 306; DOE Exhibit 12.  Thus, the DOE
psychiatrist did have direct contact with the individual and was able to draw
his conclusions based on direct observation of the individual, and based on a
substantial amount of written material related to him.</P>
<P>Moreover, the DOE psychiatrist has significant professional experience in
the area of evaluating and treating sex offenders.  As he stated in the hearing,
he has evaluated about 1000 sex offenders and treated 500 in the past twenty
years, including a number of voyeurs and exhibitionists.  Tr. at 295.  Thus,
even though the DOE psychiatrist did not spend as much time with the individual
as his treating therapist, I find that he was able to make a reliable
professional diagnosis of this individual, upon which the Hearing Officer could
properly rely.  </P>
<P>I further find that the Hearing Officer properly considered the testimony of
all of the experts regarding the rehabilitation picture for this individual.  He
weighed the testimony of the individual's therapist, who attributed greater
significance to the individual's marital problems, against the opinion of the
DOE psychiatrist, who believed that the individual suffers from chronic
psychological maladjustment.  While the individual's therapist thought that the
individual had made progress toward rehabilitation, the DOE psychiatrist
believed that the type of treatment that the therapist had provided the
individual was not really the best way to treat this sort of problem.  Tr. at
303-6, 323.  The DOE psychiatrist believed that the  individual is still in
denial and is more likely than not to reoffend.  Tr. At 308. </P>
<P>There was also testimony at the hearing by two psychologists who were
employed at the individual's plant.  Tr. At 381-95.  Both of these witnesses
examined the individual for purposes of determining whether he was able to
perform his job in a safe, reliable manner, and found that he was able to do so.
 However, this finding does not necessarily apply to the seriousness of the
illness and the question of rehabilitation for purposes of assessing a national
security risk.  With respect to the matter of national security, one of the
psychologists employed by the individual's plant admitted that he had rather
limited knowledge on the overall security issue.  Tr. at 384-386.  The other
psychologist could not give an unqualified opinion about whether the individual
was rehabilitated or about whether he presents a security risk.  Tr. at 394-95. 
Thus, the testimony by these two mental health witnesses was certainly far from
dispositive.  Moreover, the Hearing Officer had the opportunity to consider
their demeanor, and judge their credibility.  Considering these factors, I find
that there was a substantial basis in the record from which the Hearing Officer
could conclude that the testimony of these witnesses was outweighed by other
evidence.  </P>
<P>With respect to the issue of rehabilitation, the Hearing Officer was
persuaded by the testimony of the DOE psychiatrist that there was a real risk of
relapse.  I can find no error in that determination.  </P>
<P>In this regard, it is certainly possible for experts to differ honestly on
the causes, treatments and current status of a patient's mental illness.  E.g.,
<A HREF="/cases/security/vso0034.htm">Personnel Security Hearing</A> (Case No.
VSO-0034), 25 DOE &#182;82,768 (1995);
<A HREF="/cases/security/vso0032.htm">Personnel Security Hearing</A> (Case No.
VSO-0032), 25 DOE &#182; 82,765 (1995), aff'd,
<A HREF="/cases/security/vsa0032.htm">Personnel Security Review</A> (Case No.
VSA-0032), 25 DOE &#182; 83,004 (1995).  In making his determination regarding
the recommendation of access authorization, the Hearing Officer must make a
predictive assessment as to whether restoring the security clearance would not
endanger the common defense and security and would be clearly consistent with
the national interest.  10 C.F.R. &#182; 710.7(a). 
<A HREF="/cases/security/vso0044.htm">Personnel Security Hearing</A> (Case No.
VSO-0044), 25 DOE &#182; 82,780 (1995).  Thus, the considerations involved in
determining whether an individual is rehabilitated for clinical purposes may not
be identical to those involved in making an assessment as to whether an
individual is sufficiently rehabilitated for purposes of being granted an access
authorization.  In this case, the Hearing Officer had a sufficient basis for
determining that the individual had not shown that the offending sex behavior
would not recur.  Based on the DOE psychiatrist's testimony, he found the risk
of relapse was still too high to support a recommendation in favor of the
security clearance.    </P>
<P>Given the thorough testimony of the DOE psychiatrist, the weak testimony of
the two workplace psychologists, and other factors referred to by the Hearing
Officer's Opinion, such as the individual's ten year history of arrests for
exhibitionism and voyeurism, I find that there was a sufficient basis in the
record for the Hearing Officer's conclusion that the testimony of the DOE
psychiatrist outweighed that of the other mental health professionals.     </P>
<P>The individual next points to his three years of therapy, the traumatic
events caused by his mental disease (being physically attacked, and jailed), his
operation for cancer and subsequent chemotherapy,  his new-found religious
orientation and constant monitoring by DOE psychiatric personnel.  In light of
these events he argues that &quot;it is more likely than not that his behavior
has been modified,&quot; and that he has been rehabilitated.  In this regard,
the individual maintains that according to the testimony in this case, voyeurism
and exhibitionism tend to recede after the age of 40, and that these conditions
can also be affected by traumatic experiences.  The individual is XXXXX and
asserts that the cancer treatment will continue until he is approximately age
40.  He maintains that during his period of chemotherapy, his physical condition
will prevent him from engaging in any sexual offenses.  The individual contends
that given these circumstances he is unlikely to return to any of the offending
behaviors before the age of 40.  He believes that he has shown that once he
reaches that age he will no longer be at risk for that behavior.  </P>
<P>As an initial matter, I cannot agree with the contention that the individual
should no longer be considered a security risk because after age 40 voyeurism
and exhibitionism &quot;tend to recede&quot; and further because they recede
with trauma.  The testimony of the DOE psychiatrist was that there are fewer
arrests for exhibitionism after the age of 40.  Tr. at 320.  See also Exhibit 12
at 45.  However, the DOE psychiatrist went on to relate this to the fact that
the sex drive of a 50 or 60 year old man is half that of a man of 20 or 30.  Tr.
 at 320.  Thus, the testimony indicates that there is some continuum of
gradually reduced arrests for exhibitionism after the age of 40, and not that at
the age of 40 there is an immediate likelihood of no further sex offenses.&lt;4&gt;
Consequently, the fact that the individual will soon turn 40 does not
necessarily mean that the risk of recidivism will abruptly end, and that no
further security concern is therefore warranted.  </P>
<P>The individual also challenges the conclusion that he was involved in the
January 1995 peeping incident.  He argues that his wife checked on him in his
hot tub every ten minutes, so that there was only a 10 minute period of time in
which the incident could have taken place, implying that she would have
otherwise been aware that he was missing.  He contends that it is not feasible
for the incident to have taken place in that short time frame.  Specifically, he
maintains that it was not physically possible for him to have leaped over a
fence, run through the neighborhood without being seen, changed clothing, and
appeared at the door of his residence with his wife within ten minutes.  He
maintains that the Hearing Officer erred in disregarding the testimony of the
individual's wife to the effect that he could not have been the culprit in the
1995 peeping incident.  </P>
<P>Furthermore, the individual  argues that his polygraph examination
establishes his innocence in the 1995 peeping incident.   He also maintains that
he offered to take another polygraph, which the DOE did not agree to perform
because he could not obtain medical approval.  Given this fact, the individual
believes that he has met his burden of establishing that he was not involved in
the 1995 incident.  He believes that since the DOE &quot;prevented the
administration &quot; of another polygraph, it was inappropriate to find that
the individual had not met his burden of providing sufficient evidence to
support his lack of involvement in the 1995 incident.</P>
<P>The individual also believes that the DOE improperly &quot;threatened&quot;
him and his wife with a polygraph test.   He suggests that this &quot;threat&quot;
constitutes unethical behavior on the part of DOE personnel in connection with
the polygraph issue which should have been addressed by the Hearing Officer. 
</P>
<P>I see no error with respect to the Hearing Officer's treatment of this
incident.  Regarding the polygraph matter, the individual has incorrectly
asserted that he &quot;passed the test.&quot;  In fact, there was testimony by
the DOE polygraph expert to the effect that the test was defectively designed. 
Moreover, as the Hearing Officer noted, the recorded data was lost.  Therefore,
it was certainly appropriate for the Hearing Officer to determine that this test
should not be accorded any significant weight.  </P>
<P>Further, the individual's cancer treatment ruled out another polygraph
examination.  Contrary to the individual's assertion, it was not the DOE's
burden to provide the opportunity for a second polygraph.  Thus, the Hearing
Officer clearly had an ample basis for not referring to polygraph evidence in
drawing his conclusion about the 1995 incident.  I see no merit to the claim
that the Hearing Officer was in error in finding that the individual had not met
his burden of providing evidence with respect to the polygraph issue.  </P>
<P>Finally, the record does not support the assertion that there was any
improper behavior by DOE officials in connection with the polygraph test that
should have been addressed by the Hearing Officer.  The evidence in the record
shows that the DOE security specialist simply asked the individual how he would
feel about taking a polygraph test, and that the individual consented to do so. 
Transcript of February 22, 1995 Personnel Security Interview at 67.  At the
hearing, the security specialist stated that posing this question was a
technique to test the sincerity of an individual's statements.  Tr. at 65-66.  I
see no coercion or other impropriety in that question.  The individual argues
that since he was willing to take the polygraph test, he must not be &quot;guilty&quot;
of the 1995 peeping incident.  I certainly see no sufficient foundation for that
broad conclusion.  The Hearing Officer could reasonably determine that the
individual's consent to undergo a polygraph alone, was not enough evidence to
establish that he was not involved in the 1995 incident.  </P>
<P>I also see no error by the Hearing Officer in his overall conclusions
regarding the complicity of the individual in the 1995 incident.  The Hearing
Officer discussed in detail his reasons for deciding that the individual was
involved in that incident, and pointed to the evidence in the record supporting
his conclusions.  Specifically, he found the neighbor who identified the
individual as the culprit to be a credible witness at the hearing.   He also
pointed out that various witnesses estimated the time frame for the individual
to get from his house to the victim's house as no longer than five minutes.  The
Hearing Officer also noted that many witnesses at the hearing testified about
the individual's history of peeping in the victim's window.  The Hearing Officer
also pointed out that the only alibi testimony came from the individual's wife. 
 It is clear from his Opinion that the Hearing Officer found the wife's alibi
testimony alone to be less substantial than the combined testimony of the other
witnesses.  </P>
<P>From my independent review of the record, I find that there was
considerable, detailed testimony from four witnesses regarding the admitted
peeping incidents, as well as the 1995 disputed incident.  These witnesses
included the victim, her daughter, her boyfriend, and a neighbor.  Tr. at
89-176.  There was substantial testimony supporting the conclusion that the
individual was physically capable of committing the 1995 violation.  One witness
stated that the &quot;peeper&quot; was tall and athletic.  Tr. at 121.  Although
the individual claims that he was incapable of leaping over the victim's fence,
there was testimony at the hearing to the effect that an individual did leap
over the victim's fence on the occasions of the peeping incidents.  Tr. at
114-16, 131, 150-51, 163-64, 168-69.  At least one of those instances involved
an admitted peeping incident by the individual.   Witnesses testified that after
the incidents, the individual took off running and could not be caught.  Tr. at
108, 140, 145, 184.  There was also testimony that it took only 2 minutes, or at
the most five minutes to jog from the victim's house to the individual's house. 
Tr. at 155, 200.  Thus, the Hearing Officer had an adequate evidentiary basis
for concluding that it was possible to complete the peeping act, as described,
in a ten minute period, and further that the individual was physically capable
of climbing over the fence and jogging home in the short span of time involved
here. </P>
<P>On the other hand, after reviewing the record, I find the wife's testimony
to be insubstantial in confirming the individual's whereabouts on the evening in
question.  The wife stated, &quot;I don't remember this specifically--but I
don't ever remember a time not checking when people are in the hot tub.&quot; 
Tr. at 397.  She then testified, &quot;He [the individual] stayed out there [in
the hot tub] for about 3 sits--we do it in ten minute sits so that would be
about 30 minutes.&quot;  Id.  In this testimony the wife did not strongly
confirm that she actually observed the individual in the hot tub or checked on
him every ten minutes.  </P>
<P>The wife also testified that after coming into the house from using the hot
tub, the individual watched television with her.  The individual then went to
bed.  The wife indicated, however, that she was not with him in bed because she
was sitting with her sick daughter in another room for a period of time.  She
then testified that the police came to her home some time after 9:30 p.m.  She
stated that they asked her &quot;where the individual was 10 or 15 minutes ago.&quot;
 The wife testified that she told them, &quot;He's been right here, he's already
in bed.&quot;  Tr. at 399.  This testimony is certainly not very strong.  The
wife indicates that there was a period when the individual was not in her
presence, because she was watching her sick daughter while her husband was in
bed.  She then merely restates in a general way what she remembers telling the
police.  From my overall review of this testimony, there is certainly sufficient
evidence in the record to support the Hearing Officer's implicit conclusion that
the wife's alibi testimony was rather weak.  </P>
<P>In sum, I find that the Hearing Officer, who was able to observe these
witnesses and question them, was in the best position to determine whether the
cumulative testimony of the neighbors and complainants regarding the 1995
incident was more credible than that of the individual's wife.  This is
particularly so given the wife's obvious personal interest in protecting the
individual.  There is also a substantial evidentiary foundation, based on the
testimony of the complainants and neighbors, that the individual could well have
been responsible for 1995 peeping incident.  The determination of the Hearing
Officer that their testimony outweighed that of the wife was well grounded. I
see no error in the Hearing Officer's  determination and I will not reverse it.
 </P>
<P>The individual also points to testimony at the hearing that he was cleared
to handle nuclear weapons and their components under the Personal Assurance
Program (PAP) from 1993 through 1995.  He alleges that it is inconsistent to
allow him to handle nuclear weapons under the PAP, yet consider him a threat to
national security.  </P>
<P>The Hearing Officer did not specifically address this purported
inconsistency in his determination.  It is clear from the hearing transcript
that no inconsistency exists, and it hardly warrants detailed discussion.  As a
psychologist at the individual's workplace stated, PAP is a safety program. 
Under this program the employer evaluates whether a given employee poses a
safety risk on the job.  Tr. at 391-92.  There was testimony to the effect that
this individual does not pose a safety threat at work.  For example, the DOE
psychiatrist so testified, as did the two workplace psychologists.  Tr. at
338-40, 382, 386.  The Hearing Officer recognized this in his Opinion.  However,
a proceeding under Part 710 considers the broader issue of whether an individual
poses an overall security risk.  Thus, even though an individual may not present
a safety risk on the job, there may be circumstances under which he could pose a
security risk outside the work environment.  It is just this type of risk that
the Hearing Officer identified when he referred to the potential for blackmail
and coercion of this individual.  Thus, the record provides a reasoned
distinction between a security risk and a safety risk, and I see no error based
on the alleged failure to give proper weight to the individual's inclusion in
the PAP.  </P>
<P>In this regard, it is important to bear in mind that behavior that is
illegal and shows a failure of judgment poses a security threat, no matter where
it occurs.  The fact that an individual might engage in such behavior off the
job and still be a dependable worker does not eliminate the security risk
factor.  See <A HREF="/cases/security/vso0075.htm">Personnel Security Hearing</A>
(Case No. VSO-0075), 25 DOE &#182; 82,799 (1996) (request for review pending);
<A HREF="/cases/security/vso0068.htm">Personnel Security Hearing</A> (Case No.
VSO-0068), 25 DOE &#182; 82,804 (1996).  </P>
<P>The individual also contends that since his neighbors and coworkers all know
about these peeping incidents, blackmail is not possible, and that there is thus
no future risk to national security.  This argument misses the point, noted by
the Hearing Officer in his Opinion, that the individual might nevertheless be
subject to pressure in the future if his access authorization were restored.  As
the Hearing Officer pointed out, there is psychiatric evidence that there is a
substantial risk that the individual might engage again in the offending
behaviors.  Since his clearance and job would be in jeopardy if he does so, it
is possible that he individual would be vulnerable to pressure from someone who
threatened to report his misconduct.  Thus, the individual's repeated claim that
he is not subject to blackmail is not borne out by the record.  </P>
<P>In view of these circumstances, I find no error in the Hearing Officer's
determination this individual poses an unacceptably high degree of  security
risk.  </P>
<P>III. CONCLUSION</P>
<P>As is evident from the above discussion, the matters raised by the Statement
of Issues indicate that the individual strongly disagrees with the conclusions
reached by the Hearing Officer.  However, dissatisfaction and disappointment do
not amount to error by the Hearing Officer.  As I explained at the outset,
findings of fact by a Hearing Officer will be set aside only if they are not
supported by substantial evidence.  Although the non-prevailing party here may
well disagree with the outcome, as detailed above, there is ample evidence in
the record to support the Hearing Officer's determination.  </P>
<P>Accordingly, it is my opinion that the individual's access authorization
should not be restored.  10 C.F.R. &#167; 710.28(d).  </P>
<P>The regulations specify that within 30 days of receipt of this opinion, the
Director, Office of Security Affairs, will make a final determination regarding
restoration of the individual's access authorization based upon a complete
review of the record.  10 C.F.R. &#167; 710.28(e).  The Director, Office of
Security Affairs, shall through the Director, Office of Safeguards and Security,
inform the individual and his counsel in writing of the final determination, and
provide a copy of the present opinion.  Copies of the correspondence shall be
provided to the Director, Office of Hearings and Appeals, the Manager, DOE
Counsel and any other party.  In the event of an adverse determination, the
correspondence shall indicate finding by the Director, Office of Security
Affairs, with respect to each allegation contained in the Notification Letter.

<P>&lt;1&gt;An access authorization is an administrative determination that an
individual is eligible for access to classified matter or special nuclear
material.  10 C.F.R. &#167; 710.5.  Such authorization will be referred to in
this Opinion as access authorization or security clearance. </P>
<P>&lt;2&gt;As defined in the fourth revised edition of the American
Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
(DSM IV), exhibitionism involves the exposure of one's genitals to a stranger. 
Sometimes the person masturbates while exposing himself.  In some cases, the
person has the sexually arousing fantasy that the observer will become sexually
aroused. DSM IV at 525.  Voyeurism involves the act of observing unsuspecting
persons, usually strangers, who are naked, in the process of disrobing, or
engaging in sexual activity.  The act of &quot;peeping&quot; is for the purpose
of achieving sexual excitement, often through masturbation.  DSM IV at 532. </P>
<P>&lt;3&gt;That evidence includes the admitted peeping and exposure arrests of
1992 and 1993.  </P>
<P>&lt;4&gt;Further, a psychologist at the individual's workplace stated that
while arrests for exhibitionism tend to drop off at beginning at age  40,
voyeurism is persistent.  Tr. at 383.  </P>
