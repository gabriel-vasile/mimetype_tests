  <br>
  In the Case of: DJP, M.D., Petitioner,<br>
  - v -<br>
  The Inspector General.</p>
<p>DATE: July 16, 1993<br>
  <br>
  Docket No. C-93-050<br>
  Decision No. CR276<br>
  <br>
  DECISION<br>
  <br>
  I. PROCEDURAL OVERVIEW</p>
<p>On November 20, 1992, the Inspector General (I.G.) for the<br>
  Department of Health and Human Services <br>
  (DHHS) notified Petitioner that he was to be excluded from<br>
  participation in various federally-funded health <br>
  care programs, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, until<br>
  he regains his license to practice <br>
  medicine in the State of Colorado. The asserted basis for the<br>
  exclusion is section 1128(b)(4)(A) of the <br>
  Social Security Act (Act). Section 1128(b)(4)(A) of the Act<br>
  permits the Secretary of DHHS to exclude an <br>
  individual </p>
<p> whose license to provide health care has been revoked or<br>
  suspended by any State licensing authority ... <br>
  for reasons bearing on the individual's ... professional<br>
  competence, professional performance, or financial <br>
  integrity </p>
<p>Act, section 1128(b)(4)(A).</p>
<p>On January 14, 1993, Petitioner requested a hearing on the<br>
  propriety of his exclusion. He stated, as his <br>
  basis, &quot;[m]y license to practice medicine in Colorado was not<br>
  revoked for reasons relating to my &#338;professional competence, professional 
  performance, or financial<br>
  integrity, but because of an illness I am <br>
  recovering from.&quot; </p>
<p>During the prehearing conference of February 25, 1993, the parties<br>
  agreed to submit the case for summary <br>
  disposition. In accordance with my briefing order, the I.G. filed<br>
  a motion for summary disposition with <br>
  supporting brief (to be referred to herein as I.G. Br. at (page))<br>
  and four attached exhibits (to be referred to <br>
  herein as I.G. Ex. (number) at (page)). Petitioner filed his brief<br>
  in opposition (P. Br. at (page)), which was <br>
  followed by the I.G.'s reply brief (I.G. R. Br. at (page)). <br>
  Petitioner did not submit any exhibits.</p>
<p>The parties' submissions establish that they disagree on whether<br>
  Petitioner's medical license was revoked <br>
  for reasons bearing on his professional competence or performance. <br>
  The dispute exists because the <br>
  Colorado State Board of Medical Examiners (Medical Board) had<br>
  revoked Petitioner's license under a part <br>
  of the Colorado statutes that refers to the use of fraud,<br>
  misrepresenta-tion, or deception in applying for, <br>
  securing, or renewing a license. I.G. Ex. 3 at 23, 24. The<br>
  Medical Board specifically declined to revoke <br>
  Petitioner's license under the statutory section that refers to a<br>
  practitioner's inability to render medical <br>
  services with reasonable safety and skill due to a mental or<br>
  physical disability. Id. Even though Petitioner <br>
  was found to have a mental disability that adversely affects his<br>
  ability to practice medicine, the Medical <br>
  Board concluded -- in considering the discipline warranted by<br>
  Petitioner's mental disability alone -- that <br>
  Petitioner could be allowed to practice medicine with safety to his<br>
  patients, under certain restrictions. Id. at <br>
  29; I.G. Ex. 4. </p>
<p>For the reasons that follow, I affirm the exclusion imposed and<br>
  directed against Petitioner by the I.G. I <br>
  affirm the exclusion even though the Medical Board found that<br>
  Petitioner received consistently good <br>
  ratings throughout his medical career and that, had Petitioner not<br>
  given false statements in his license <br>
  application and license renewal form, he would have been allowed to<br>
  retain his medical license.</p>
<p> II. FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</p>
<p>A. Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law by Agreement of the<br>
  Parties&#338; 1. Petitioner was licensed to practice medicine in the State<br>
  of Colorado on March 16, 1990.</p>
<p> 2. Petitioner specialized in internal medicine during his<br>
  medical residency.</p>
<p> 3. The Colorado State Board of Medical Examiners (Medical<br>
  Board) is the State agency responsible for <br>
  the licensure of and discipline of physicians in Colorado.</p>
<p> 4. The Medical Board determined that Petitioner is suffering<br>
  from a severe and chronic mental <br>
  disability relating to a psychosexual disorder.</p>
<p> 5. The Medical Board determined that Petitioner acted with<br>
  reckless disregard for the truth when he <br>
  answered &quot;no&quot; to question 20 on his initial application for<br>
  licensure in Colorado that asked &quot;Do you now <br>
  have, or have you ever had, a physical or mental condition which<br>
  might affect your ability to practice <br>
  medicine?&quot;</p>
<p> 6. The Medical Board determined that &quot;[b]ased on the record<br>
  as a whole, [Petitioner's] false answer to <br>
  question 20 on his application demonstrates that he is not<br>
  qualified to practice medicine in Colorado at this <br>
  time&quot; and revoked Petitioner's license to practice medicine.</p>
<p> 7. Upon review, on June 19, 1992, Hearing Panel B of the<br>
  Medical Board rendered a &quot;Final Board <br>
  Order&quot; affirming the initial decision to revoke Petitioner's<br>
  license to practice medicine in the State of <br>
  Colorado.</p>
<p> 8. On November 20, 1992, the I.G. notified Petitioner that,<br>
  effective December 10, 1992, he was being <br>
  excluded from the Medicare and Medicaid programs pursuant to<br>
  section 1128(b)(4) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. <br>
  1320-7(b)(4). <br>
  <br>
  9. The I.G.'s exclusion was predicated upon the Medical<br>
  Board's revocation of Petitioner's license, <br>
  which was for unprofessional conduct, namely for recklessly<br>
  disregarding the truth when completing his <br>
  licensure application.</p>
<p> 10. The I.G. excluded Petitioner from the Medicare and<br>
  Medicaid programs until he regains a valid <br>
  license to practice medicine in Colorado.<br>
  &#338; 11. The regulations require that the length of an exclusion<br>
  imposed under section 1128(b)(4) will never <br>
  be for a period of time less than the period during which an<br>
  individual's license is revoked, unless <br>
  paragraph (c) applies. 42 C.F.R. 1001.501(b)(1) (1992). <br>
  Paragraph (c) allows for a lesser period of <br>
  exclusion when a second State licensing board, after being fully<br>
  apprised of all the circumstances <br>
  surrounding the revocation, suspension, or loss of the individual's<br>
  license, decides to grant that individual a <br>
  license or decides not to take any significant adverse action<br>
  relating to a currently held license. </p>
<p> 12. The regulations at 42 C.F.R. 1001.501(b)(1) are binding<br>
  upon the ALJs, the Departmental Appeals <br>
  Board, and federal courts. 58 Fed. Reg. 5618 (1993) (to be<br>
  codified at 42 C.F.R. 1001.1(b)).</p>
<p>B. Other Findings of Fact And Conclusions of Law.</p>
<p> 13. The Secretary of DHHS delegated to the I.G. the authority<br>
  to determine, impose, and direct <br>
  exclusions pursuant to section 1128 of the Act. 53 Fed. Reg. 12993<br>
  (1988). <br>
  <br>
  14. Petitioner cannot avail himself of the two<br>
  exceptions found at 42 C.F.R. 1001.501(c).</p>
<p> 15. With regard to section 1001.501(c)(1),<br>
  there is no evidence that Petitioner holds a<br>
  medical license outside of Colorado.</p>
<p> 16. With regard to section 1001.501(c)(2),<br>
  Petitioner is not entitled to an ALJ hearing<br>
  on the possibility of reinstatement into the<br>
  programs if he should secure a license from<br>
  another State.</p>
<p> 17. In deciding whether to revoke Petitioner's medical<br>
  license, the Medical Board determined, inter <br>
  alia, that:</p>
<p> a. Petitioner's psychosexual disorder (see finding 4,<br>
  above) has affected him in his dealings with <br>
  patients, including having caused him to be sexually aroused by his<br>
  patients, impaired his ability to make <br>
  differential diagnosis during October of 1990, and caused him to<br>
  have sexual intimacies with a patient. <br>
  I.G. Ex. 3 at 7, 13.<br>
  &#338; b. There exists a risk that Petitioner will act out<br>
  sexually in the context of the physician-patient <br>
  relationship. Id. at 13. <br>
  c. Various incidents, including Petitioner's giving a<br>
  false answer to question 20 on his application <br>
  form for a medical license in Colorado, demonstrate that Petitioner<br>
  engages in a pattern of trying to conceal <br>
  his sexual disorder by telling half-truths or lies. Id. at 18 -<br>
  21.</p>
<p> d. Petitioner has suffered from denial, which is<br>
  a fundamental<br>
  symptom of his sexual addiction.<br>
  Id. at 21.<br>
  <br>
  e. With treatment, Petitioner is in the early stage of<br>
  recovery, which is a lifetime process. Id. at 12.</p>
<p> f. Petitioner is at risk for relapse, which is a typical<br>
  feature of any addictive illness. Id. at 12 - 13.<br>
  <br>
  g. Petitioner's disorder renders him unable to perform<br>
  medical services with safety to patients. Id. at <br>
  24.</p>
<p> 18. In addition to having found that on his initial<br>
  application form for a medical license in Colorado <br>
  Petitioner had answered question 20 with reckless disregard for the<br>
  truth (finding 5), the Medical Board <br>
  found also that Petitioner had given a &quot;knowingly false&quot; answer to<br>
  the same question on his license renewal <br>
  application during the Spring of 1991. Id. at 19.</p>
<p> 19. Question 20 on the initial application and renewal<br>
  application forms bears on Petitioner's <br>
  professional competence and performance in that it asks about his<br>
  ability to practice medicine. Findings 5 <br>
  and 18.</p>
<p> 20. By falsely denying on his initial application form and<br>
  his renewal application form that he had any <br>
  mental condition that might affect his ability to practice<br>
  medicine, Petitioner misrepresented his <br>
  professional competence and performance. Findings 5, 18, 19. <br>
  <br>
  21. The decision to revoke Petitioner's medical license due<br>
  to his false answer to question 20 (finding <br>
  6) was made for reasons bearing on his professional competence and<br>
  performance. Findings 17, 19, and <br>
  20.&#338; 22. The I.G. acted within the scope of the I.G.'s authority<br>
  in directing and imposing the permissive <br>
  exclusion under section 1128(b)(4)(A) of the Act, for the<br>
  protection of the programs' beneficiaries and <br>
  recipients. Findings 17, 19 - 21. <br>
  <br>
  23. Both parties agree that the provisions of 42 C.F.R. <br>
  1001.501(b)(1) are binding and, therefore, that <br>
  the exclusion must be for the period during which Petitioner's<br>
  license remains revoked in Colorado. <br>
  Findings 10, 11, 14, 15, 16.</p>
<p> 24. There exists no dispute concerning thereasonableness of<br>
  Petitioner's period of <br>
  exclusion. Finding 23.</p>
<p> 25. The law and facts of record clearly establish<br>
  that there is a proper basis for Petitioner's<br>
  exclusion under section 1128(b)(4)(A) of the Act.<br>
  Findings 1 - 24.</p>
<p><br>
  III. ANALYSIS</p>
<p>A. My Decision centers on why the Medical Board revoked<br>
  Petitioner's license.<br>
  <br>
  The sole issue of material fact before me is whether the I.G. had<br>
  a basis for excluding Petitioner from <br>
  participating in the Medicare and Medicaid programs under section<br>
  1128(b)(4)(A) of the Act. Petitioner <br>
  and the I.G. agree that summary disposition is appropriate. P. Br.<br>
  at 8, 10. Both parties acknowledge that <br>
  the I.G.'s authority to exclude Petitioner can arise only from<br>
  section 1128(b)(4)(A) of the Act. Assuming <br>
  there exists a basis for the exclusion, the regulatory requirements<br>
  of 42 C.F.R. 1001.501(b)(1) control all <br>
  adjudications on the issue of whether the period of exclusion is<br>
  reasonable. I.G. Br. at 7, 18 - 19; P. Brief <br>
  at 4 (referring to the I.G.'s proposed finding number 21).</p>
<p>The regulations require that, unless the enumerated exceptions<br>
  apply, the length of an exclusion imposed <br>
  pursuant to section 1001.501(b)(1) &quot;will never be for a period of<br>
  time less than the period during which an <br>
  individual's or entity's license is revoked, suspended or otherwise<br>
  not in effect as a result of, or in <br>
  connection with, a State licensing agency action.&quot; 42 C.F.R. <br>
  1001.501(b)(1). Here the State's revocation <br>
  of Petitioner's license is to remain in effect indefinitely and theI.G. imposed 
  a minimum coterminous <br>
  exclusion pursuant to said regulation. The I.G. did not give any<br>
  consideration to the existence of any of the <br>
  aggravating factors listed in 42 C.F.R. 1001.501(b)(2) for<br>
  lengthening the exclusion. See the I.G.'s <br>
  November 20, 1992 exclusion letter. Thus, none of the mitigating<br>
  circumstances enumerated in the <br>
  regulation applies because they may be considered &quot;[o]nly if any of<br>
  the aggravating factors listed ... <br>
  justifies a longer exclusion.&quot; 42 C.F.R. 1001.501(b)(3).</p>
<p>Even though the facts of this case do not necessitate my reaching<br>
  the issue of what factors can mitigate the <br>
  length of Petitioner's exclusion, I note that Petitioner has<br>
  proposed several findings of fact that are <br>
  inconsistent with 42 C.F.R. 1001.501(b)(3). The absence of<br>
  alcohol or drug related problems (P. Br. at 9, <br>
  proposed finding 6), the Medical Board's ability to limit a<br>
  physician's practice (id., proposed finding 12), <br>
  the absence of an obligation to tell Petitioner's medical school of<br>
  his arrest (id., proposed finding 13), the <br>
  absence of patient complaints during Petitioner's residency (id.,<br>
  proposed finding 14), and praise by <br>
  Petitioner's supervisors (id., proposed finding 16) are not among<br>
  the enumerated mitigating factors that can <br>
  be considered under 42 C.F.R. 1001.501(b)(3) for reducing<br>
  Petitioner's exclusion period. I have therefore <br>
  rejected the use of these assertions as formal findings even though<br>
  they are not refuted. To the extent I <br>
  discuss these or like facts, I do so for background purposes only. <br>
</p>
<p>Petitioner objected to the I.G.'s proposed finding number 20 that<br>
  &quot;the exception found at 42 C.F.R. <br>
  1001.501(c) (1992) is inapplicable to the case at bar.&quot; I.G. Br.<br>
  at 7; P. Br. at 7. Petitioner argued that the <br>
  exception &quot;should be afforded to Petitioner at any time.&quot; P. Br.<br>
  at 7. Petitioner further argued that he has <br>
  the option of securing a license in another State, that he is not<br>
  limited to regaining his Colorado license, <br>
  and that, therefore, his exclusion should remain in effect only<br>
  until he obtains a valid license to practice <br>
  medicine in any State. Id. at 8. Even though Petitioner has not<br>
  indicated to which of the two possible <br>
  exceptions listed in subsection (c) he is directing his various<br>
  arguments, all aspects of his propositions lack <br>
  legal or factual support in the proceedings before me.</p>
<p>The first exception in subsection (c) refers to determining the<br>
  length of the exclusion where, &quot;prior to the &#338;notice of exclusion 
  by the OIG,&quot; the licensing authority of a<br>
  different State has granted an individual a <br>
  license or refrained from taking any adverse action against an<br>
  individual's license after having been fully <br>
  apprised of circumstances that gave rise to the individual's<br>
  license suspension or revocation in another <br>
  State. 42 C.F.R. 1001.501(c)(1) (emphasis added). This<br>
  regulatory exception, by its unequivocal terms, <br>
  is not available to Petitioner at any time as he argues. It was<br>
  available to Petitioner only prior to his receipt <br>
  of the I.G.'s November 20, 1992 letter notifying him of his<br>
  exclusion. Petitioner has never alleged that he <br>
  holds a license outside Colorado. In the record before me, there<br>
  is evidence only concerning the actions <br>
  taken by Colorado's licensing authority. Having agreed with the<br>
  I.G. that I should decide this case by <br>
  summary disposition on the present record (P. Br. at 8), Petitioner<br>
  has waived the submission of any <br>
  evidence he might have had relating to any valid license he may<br>
  hold elsewhere. This regulatory exception <br>
  is not available to Petitioner now or later.</p>
<p>The second exception in subsection (c) relates to the I.G.'s<br>
  discretionary authority to permit early <br>
  reinstatement of an excluded individual where another State's<br>
  licensing authority either grants the <br>
  individual a license or refrains from taking adverse action against<br>
  an individual's current license after being <br>
  fully apprised of the circumstances that gave rise to a license<br>
  suspension or revocation. 42 C.F.R. <br>
  1001.501(c)(2). Here, not only has the delegation been made to<br>
  the I.G., the regulation limits the <br>
  Petitioner's rights under this subsection to having the I.G.<br>
  &quot;consider a request for early reinstatement&quot; <br>
  (emphasis added). Id. I have no authority to adjudicate the issue<br>
  of whether Petitioner can or should <br>
  receive early reinstatement at the I.G.'s discretion. See, 42<br>
  C.F.R. 1001.2007. Moreover, Petitioner is not <br>
  entitled to an advisory opinion concerning the possibility that he<br>
  might be able to obtain a license from <br>
  another State.</p>
<p>On the issue of the I.G.'s basis for excluding Petitioner under<br>
  section 1128(b)(4)(A) of the Act, the parties <br>
  agree that the principal question of fact is whether Petitioner's<br>
  license was revoked for reasons bearing on <br>
  his professional competence or performance. P. Br. at 8.</p>
<p>The license revocation proceedings arose after Petitioner informed<br>
  the Medical Board, by letter dated &#338;December 31, 1990, that he had pled 
  guilty to a charge of indecent<br>
  exposure and was receiving treatment <br>
  for what he described as his sex addiction. I.G. Ex. 2 at 2; I.G.<br>
  Ex. 3 at 1 - 2. On July 25, 1991, Inquiry <br>
  Panel A of the Medical Board, upon reviewing Petitioner's file,<br>
  summarily suspended Petitioner's license to <br>
  practice medicine. Panel A's conclusion was that, due to<br>
  Petitioner's mental disability, his continued <br>
  practice of medicine constituted &quot;an imminent threat to the public<br>
  health, safety and welfare of the People <br>
  of Colorado...&quot; I.G. Ex. 2 at 4. Also, Panel A further directed<br>
  the Office of Attorney General to request <br>
  revocation of Petitioner's license at a hearing. Id. </p>
<p>An evidentiary hearing was held before State Administrative Law<br>
  Judge Nancy Connick, during September <br>
  and October 1991, on the issue of whether Petitioner's license to<br>
  practice medicine should be revoked <br>
  pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. 12-36-101 to 126 (1985, 1991). <br>
  I.G. Ex. 3. The State Attorney General <br>
  charged Petitioner with two separate counts of &quot;unprofessional<br>
  conduct&quot; which, under Colorado law, <br>
  subjects a licensee to discipline. Count I alleged that Petitioner<br>
  had violated Colo. Rev. Stat. 12-36-<br>
  117(1)(o) (1985), which defines &quot;unprofessional conduct&quot; as &quot;[s]uch<br>
  physical or mental disability as to <br>
  render the licensee unable to perform medical services with<br>
  reasonable skill and with safety to the <br>
  patients.&quot; I.G. Ex. 3 at 23, 24. Count II alleged that Petitioner<br>
  had violated Colo. Rev. Stat. 12-36-<br>
  117(1)(a) (1985), which defines &quot;unprofessional conduct&quot; as<br>
  &quot;[r]esorting to fraud, misrepresentation or <br>
  deception in applying for, securing, renewing, or seeking<br>
  reinstatement of a license ....&quot; Id. On the basis of <br>
  the evidence before her, Judge Connick concluded that violations<br>
  had been established under both counts; <br>
  however, revocation of Petitioner's medical license was warranted<br>
  only under Count II. Id. at 23 - 31.</p>
<p>Pursuant to exceptions filed by Petitioner, Judge Connick's Initial<br>
  Decision, dated November 18, 1991, was <br>
  reviewed by the Medical Board's Hearing Panel B. I.G. Ex. 4. In<br>
  a Final Board Order, Panel B <br>
  incorporated Judge Connick's hearing decision in full and affirmed<br>
  and adopted her findings of fact and <br>
  conclusions of law. Id. at 1. However, Panel B specifically<br>
  rejected that part of Judge Connick's decision <br>
  that serious consideration be given to any motion for<br>
  reconsideration Petitioner might file after the passage <br>
  of three or more years. Id. at 2. Panel B said it did not wish tocreate any 
  expectation of reinstatement. Id.</p>
<p>There was no further appeal of the Medical Board's decision to<br>
  revoke Petitioner's license. </p>
<p>In addressing the present issue of whether Petitioner's license was<br>
  revoked by the Medical Board for <br>
  reasons bearing on his professional competence or performance, I<br>
  have analyzed the relevant parts of Judge <br>
  Connick's decision as affirmed, adopted, and incorporated in the<br>
  Medical Board's Final Board Order. In <br>
  my Decision, I refer to the findings and conclusions as Judge<br>
  Connick's for convenience.</p>
<p>It is well settled that, in contesting their exclusions, parties<br>
  may not collaterally attack the findings made <br>
  against them in other forums by other adjudicators of competent<br>
  jurisdiction. Petitioner herein, while <br>
  urging me to decide this case on the basis of an evidentiary record<br>
  consisting solely of the administrative <br>
  decisions issued in his license revocation proceedings and parts of<br>
  the Colorado Revised Statutes (see, e.g., <br>
  P. Br. at 10 (proposed finding 19)), also urges me to draw<br>
  conclusions about his honesty and his fitness to <br>
  practice medicine that are not in total accord with Judge Connick's<br>
  findings (see, e.g., P. Br. at 8 - 10 <br>
  (proposed findings 4, 5, 9, 15)). Moreover, Petitioner reasserted<br>
  parts of his defense that had failed in the <br>
  license revocation proceedings. In deciding whether the I.G. had<br>
  a proper basis for excluding Petitioner <br>
  under section 1128(b)(4)(A) of the Act, I am not altering Judge<br>
  Connick's findings or conclusions on the <br>
  issues before her. Instead, I am rejecting Petitioner's proposed<br>
  findings and arguments that are at variance <br>
  with Judge Connick's decision.</p>
<p><br>
  B. The progression of Petitioner's disorder has caused him to deny<br>
  its impact on his ability to safely <br>
  practice medicine.</p>
<p>Judge Connick found that Petitioner suffers from a mental disorder<br>
  that has intensified over time and has <br>
  persisted despite treatment. I.G. Ex. 3 at 24. Judge Connick<br>
  adopted the diagnosis of various mental <br>
  health experts that Petitioner clearly suffers from a psychosexual<br>
  disorder, including the paraphilia of <br>
  exhibitionism and other paraphilia not otherwise specified, which<br>
  is characterized by significant addictive <br>
  features. In addition, Petitioner has suffered from depression attimes, as 
  well as from a personality <br>
  disorder that includes narcissistic, passive/dependent, and<br>
  obsessive/compulsive traits. His disorder is <br>
  chronic, severe, and compulsive because it has lasted more than six<br>
  months and he &quot;exhibits a <br>
  preoccupation with sexual behavior which becomes so strong that it<br>
  overrides the adverse consequences of <br>
  such behavior.&quot; Id. at 11, 16, 33. </p>
<p>In addition, Petitioner has suffered from denial as a part of his<br>
  addictive disorder, and he has engaged in a <br>
  pattern of trying to conceal his sexual disorder by telling<br>
  half-truths or lies to authorities. Id. at 21. <br>
  Petitioner's actions in this regard &quot;constitute[s] unprofessional<br>
  conduct by resorting to fraud, <br>
  misrepresentation, or deception in applying for and in securing his<br>
  license ....&quot; Id. at 29.</p>
<p>The record shows the impact Petitioner's disorder has had on his<br>
  dealings with patients and on his <br>
  willingness to tell the truth about the consequences of his<br>
  disorder. </p>
<p>When Petitioner was very young, he began to manifest symptoms of<br>
  what would later be diagnosed as his <br>
  sexual disorder. Id. at 2. His early symptoms included<br>
  exhibitionism, compulsive masturbation, and <br>
  attempts to participate in voyeurism. Id. The symptoms persisted<br>
  through his adolescence and college <br>
  years. Id. </p>
<p>After Petitioner enrolled in Northwestern University's School of<br>
  Medicine in September of 1984, the rate <br>
  of his exhibitionism increased. Id. The victims of his<br>
  exhibitionism were all unknown to him and tended <br>
  to be small groups of teenage girls -- although Petitioner has<br>
  exhibited himself to older women as well. Id. <br>
  at 2 - 3. Petitioner admitted to having been sexually aroused by<br>
  female patients while in medical school. <br>
  Id. at 13.</p>
<p>From 1985 to 1988, Petitioner obtained professional counselling for<br>
  his sexual disorder. Id. at 3. For two <br>
  of those years, 1986 to 1988, Petitioner also attended Sex Addicts<br>
  Anonymous (SAA) meetings on the <br>
  recommenda-tion of his counsellor. Id. </p>
<p>On March 10, 1988, during his last year of medical school and while<br>
  still attending SAA meetings, <br>
  Petitioner exited naked from his car in a residential neighborhoodof Cook County, 
  Illinois, and exposed <br>
  himself to three teenage girls. Id. </p>
<p>During April 1988, shortly after his arrest, Petitioner completed<br>
  a form that was used by the Air Force in <br>
  financing his medical education. Id. at 19. In this form, and<br>
  also in other forms he had previously <br>
  completed for the Air Force, Petitioner had answered &quot;no&quot; to the<br>
  question &quot;[h]ave you ever been treated for <br>
  a mental condition?&quot; Id. at 19 - 20. Due to the nature of<br>
  Petitioner's counselling sessions and SAA <br>
  meetings at that time, Judge Connick found the record insufficient<br>
  to establish that Petitioner's answers on <br>
  these forms were false. Id.<br>
  On April 11, 1988, Petitioner pled guilty to the charge of public<br>
  indecency for having exposed himself to <br>
  the three teenage girls. Id. at 3 - 4. Under the sentence that<br>
  was imposed, Petitioner was to receive <br>
  psychological and psychiatric counselling until the court<br>
  discharged him from its supervision on April 10, <br>
  1990. Id. During his residency at the University of Colorado<br>
  Health Science Center, Petitioner received <br>
  treatment at RSA, Inc., from late August 1988 to mid-January 1990. <br>
  Id. at 4 - 6. </p>
<p>During May 1989, while under continuing court ordered supervision<br>
  and treatment, Petitioner completed <br>
  another financial aid form for the Air Force. This time, in answer<br>
  to the question of whether he had been <br>
  treated for a mental condition, Petitioner answered &quot;[n]o meds<br>
  given, only counsel. `General Anxiety' -- <br>
  seen by private non-M.D. psychologist/ordained minister, Denver CO<br>
  10/88-4/89.&quot; Id. at 20. Later, at his <br>
  license revocation proceedings, Petitioner tried to assert that he<br>
  did not believe he was being treated for a <br>
  mental condition and viewed his exhibitionism as akin to a traffic<br>
  violation. Id. Judge Connick found his <br>
  answer of May 1989 to be inaccurate. Id.<br>
  <br>
  During November 1989, while still being treated at RSA pursuant to<br>
  court order, Petitioner applied for a <br>
  Colorado medical license. In an application form dated November<br>
  14, 1989, Petitioner answered &quot;no&quot; to <br>
  the question (number 20) &quot;[d]o you now have, or have you ever had,<br>
  a physical or mental disability which <br>
  might affect your ability to practice medicine ?&quot; Id. at 19. The<br>
  Medical Board issued him a license on <br>
  March 16, 1991, in reliance upon his answers on this application. <br>
  Id. at 1, 19. It later found that Petitioner <br>
  had given his answer on the application form in reckless disregardof the truth. 
  Id. at 28.</p>
<p>In RSA Petitioner was being taught, inter alia, the behavior<br>
  modification techniques that would reduce his <br>
  inappropriate arousal. Id. at 4. However, even during this court<br>
  supervised treatment course, Petitioner <br>
  continued to exhibit symptoms of his disorder while appearing to<br>
  progress in treatment. Id. at 3, 6. </p>
<p>After completing the RSA program in late January, 1990,<br>
  Petitioner's sexual compulsions escalated to the <br>
  point where he again exposed himself several times during the<br>
  ensuing months. Id. <br>
  In April 1990, during his last year of residency and about the time<br>
  he was being released from his legal <br>
  obligations under the court's order, Petitioner exhibited symptoms<br>
  of his sexual disorder by having a sexual <br>
  encounter with a patient who performed oral sex on him. Id. at 7. <br>
  Ethical standards prohibit a physician <br>
  from having a sexual relationship with a current or former patient. <br>
  Id. Petitioner's behavior towards this <br>
  patient (e.g., accepting a card with her phone number, interpreting<br>
  the giving of her card as a sexual <br>
  overture, initiating a visit to her several weeks after examining<br>
  her as a patient, and having the sexual <br>
  encounter with her) was &quot;symptomatic of his sexual disorder.&quot; Id. 
  <br>
</p>
<p>In June 1990, in filing another renewal form for financial aid from<br>
  the Air Force, Petitioner answered the <br>
  question of whether he had ever been treated for a mental condition<br>
  by stating: &quot;General Anxiety (Isolated <br>
  incident resulting from a patient's death) spring 1989.&quot; Id. at<br>
  20. Petitioner's answer was inaccurate and <br>
  affirmatively misleading. Id. He had actually completed a<br>
  treatment course of many months at RSA and <br>
  was continuing other regular treatment under a mental health<br>
  professional. Id. <br>
  <br>
  In August 1990, Petitioner exposed himself to two eight year old<br>
  girls in a residential area of Arapaho <br>
  County, Colorado. Id. at 7. One of the victims suffered an<br>
  adjustment disorder and anxiety as a result. Id <br>
  at 7 - 8.<br>
  On August 28, 1990, Petitioner was arrested and charged with<br>
  indecent exposure for having shown himself <br>
  to the eight year old girls. Id. at 7. After having been informed<br>
  that he had the right to remain silent, <br>
  Petitioner lied and denied the behavior to the police. Id. at 20. <br>
  He subsequently sought to justify his lying &#338;with the explanation that 
  he made his false statement in an effort<br>
  to see an attorney and have due process. <br>
  Id. <br>
  Around Labor Day of 1990, Petitioner drove to California intending<br>
  to kill himself. Id. at 8. He returned <br>
  to Denver after having had &quot;anonymous&quot; sex and resolved to obtain<br>
  help for his disorder. Id. </p>
<p>By October 3, 1990, Petitioner's preoccupation with sexual behavior<br>
  was interfering with his professional <br>
  concentration to the point where it was causing him to have<br>
  problems in making differential diagnoses. Id. <br>
  at 13. </p>
<p>On October 4, 1990, Petitioner purchased a gun and alerted his wife<br>
  that he wished to commit suicide. Id. <br>
  at 8. He was hospitalized for depression until October 16, 1990. <br>
  Id. He was then transferred to another <br>
  facility, where during the period October 16, 1990 to November 20,<br>
  1990, he received five weeks of <br>
  intensive, inpatient treatment for his psychosexual disorder. Id. </p>
<p>In November 1990, after the hospital released him to resume work<br>
  without restrictions, Petitioner began <br>
  monthly sessions with a psychiatrist. Id. On November 21, 1990,<br>
  Petitioner began receiving outpatient <br>
  treatment with a pastoral counsellor and also began attending SAA<br>
  meetings as well. Id. at 8 - 9.</p>
<p>Also on November 21, 1990, Petitioner reported his sexual disorder<br>
  to the director of his internal medicine <br>
  residency program. Id. at 9. From the lateness of this report,<br>
  from Petitioner's failure to voluntarily <br>
  disclose his arrest in Chicago to the Northwestern University<br>
  School of Medicine, and from the inaccurate <br>
  or misleading answer Petitioner had provided to the Air Force,<br>
  Judge Connick inferred that Petitioner may <br>
  have been actively concealing his sexual disorder. Id. at 20.</p>
<p>Upon being told of Petitioner's sexual disorder, the director of<br>
  Petitioner's residency program referred him <br>
  to the Colorado Physician Health Program (CPHP). Id. at 9. CPHP<br>
  is an independent organization that <br>
  evaluates, refers for treatment, and monitors Colorado physicians<br>
  with health problems. Id. </p>
<p>Dr. Michael Gendel, a CPHP staff psychiatrist, evaluated Petitioner<br>
  in November and December of 1990. <br>
  During these evaluations Petitioner initially denied havingexhibited symptoms 
  of his disorder in the <br>
  workplace. Id. at 9, 21. It was not until Dr. Gendel probed the<br>
  subject further that Petitioner admitted the <br>
  sexual encounter with his patient and said he had become cognizant<br>
  of its inappropriateness. Id. at 21. </p>
<p>Dr. Gendel found in his preliminary assessment as well as in his<br>
  completed analysis that Petitioner could <br>
  resume his residency in internal medicine with reasonable skill and<br>
  safety -- especially since he had agreed <br>
  to a complex treatment schedule and monitoring. Id. at 9 - 10. <br>
  Petitioner was then permitted to resume his <br>
  residency in December 1990. However, because Petitioner had<br>
  revealed his prior sexual relationship with <br>
  a patient, Dr. Gendel told Petitioner that either he (Dr. Gendel)<br>
  or Petitioner must report Petitioner's sexual <br>
  disorder to the Medical Board. Id. at 10. <br>
  <br>
  On December 13, 1990, Petitioner pled guilty to the indecent<br>
  exposure charge involving his behavior <br>
  before the two eight year old girls. Id. at 7. </p>
<p>On December 31, 1990, Petitioner notified the Medical Board of his<br>
  sexual disorder and treatment. Id. at <br>
  1. </p>
<p>On January 10, 1991, Petitioner signed a Participation Agreement<br>
  with CPHP. Id. at 10. The agreement <br>
  required Petitioner to attend three SAA or similar meetings a week,<br>
  to participate in weekly psychotherapy <br>
  sessions, to continue psychotherapy in order to address<br>
  work-related stress issues, and to refrain from <br>
  exposing himself, having &quot;anonymous&quot; sex, or having sex with<br>
  present or former patients. Id.</p>
<p>As a result of his August 1990 arrest for indecent exposure, on<br>
  February 28, 1991, the Arapaho County <br>
  court sentenced Petitioner to 60 days of incarceration -- which he<br>
  served during April and May of 1991. <br>
  The sentencing order entered by the court on February 28, 1991 also<br>
  barred Petitioner from treating anyone <br>
  under the age of 18 and required Petitioner to verify, in writing<br>
  to the Probation Office, that he had made <br>
  his supervisors aware of the court imposed restriction. Id. at 7.<br>
  <br>
  Petitioner, who was present at the hearing, heard the sentence, and<br>
  later received a copy of it, never <br>
  notified his supervisors that he was prohibited from treating<br>
  anyone under the age of 18. Id. As a result, <br>
  none of his supervisors was aware of the court-imposed limitation. Id. Petitioner 
  tried to use the excuse of <br>
  emotional stress to justify his silence. Id. He later conceded at<br>
  the hearing before Judge Connick that he <br>
  had no good reason for having violated the court's order. Id. </p>
<p>During the Spring of 1991, when Petitioner applied for renewal of<br>
  his Colorado medical license, he again <br>
  answered &quot;no&quot; to the question &quot;[d]o you now have or have you 
  ever<br>
  had, a physical or mental disability <br>
  which might affect your ability to practice medicine?&quot; Id. at 19. <br>
  Judge Connick found this answer <br>
  &quot;knowingly false&quot; in light of Petitioner's prior criminal offenses,<br>
  his having already received intensive <br>
  treatment from several professionals, his having been twice<br>
  informed (and having professed to understand) <br>
  that his sexual encounter with a patient was inappropriate and<br>
  symptomatic of his disorder, his having <br>
  entered into a participation agreement with the CPHP in the prior<br>
  months, and his having alerted the <br>
  Medical Board to his sex addiction and arrests. Id.</p>
<p>Until approximately July 1991, when Petitioner left Colorado to<br>
  begin orientation for his Air Force service, <br>
  he continued to attend meetings and treatment sessions pursuant to<br>
  his Participation Agreement with <br>
  CPHP. Id. at 10 - 11. However, between November 1990 and July<br>
  1991, Petitioner had several affairs <br>
  symptomatic of his sexual disorder. This was contrary to one<br>
  counsellor's instructions to remain celibate <br>
  for self-improvement. Id. One of Petitioner's affairs was with a<br>
  woman he met during an SAA meeting. <br>
  Petitioner had the affair, even though he had been told that sexual<br>
  relationships between group members <br>
  were strictly forbidden. Id.</p>
<p>In September 1991, Petitioner lied when he was being evaluated in<br>
  connection with his Colorado license <br>
  revocation proceedings. Richard Irons, M.D., headed a team of<br>
  professionals who evaluated Petitioner <br>
  prior to the hearing before Judge Connick in order to determine<br>
  whether, or under what conditions, <br>
  Petitioner could practice medicine with reasonable skill and<br>
  safety. Id. at 15. Even though Petitioner had <br>
  previously told other medical professionals that he knew his sexual<br>
  relationship with a patient had been <br>
  inappropriate and violated professional boundaries, he initially<br>
  told Dr. Irons that he had never had a sexual <br>
  contact with a patient. Id. at 21. He later indicated that he did<br>
  not see what this sexual relationship with <br>
  the patient had to do with the practice of medicine. Id. &#338;Sexual addiction 
  has three levels of increasing severity: 1)<br>
  victimless behavior such as excessive <br>
  masturbation, use of pornography, frequenting topless bars, and<br>
  calling sexually oriented recorded <br>
  messages; 2) behavior involving legal problems such as<br>
  exhibitionism, voyeurism, excessive obscene <br>
  telephone conversations, prostitution, and taking indecent<br>
  liberties; and 3) more extreme behavior such as <br>
  child molestation, incest, or rape. Id. at 11 - 12. Judge Connick<br>
  was of the view that Petitioner had never <br>
  exhibited behavior beyond level 2, and he has maintained his<br>
  behavior at level 1 since November 1990, for <br>
  reasons that are due, at least in part, to his legal problems. Id.<br>
  at 12. Events such as an arrest and the <br>
  proceedings to revoke a medical license can reduce the sex drive of<br>
  an individual suffering from a chronic, <br>
  psychosexual, addictive disorder. Id. </p>
<p>At the time of his license revocation hearing, Petitioner had<br>
  successfully completed primary treatment and <br>
  was in the early stage of a life-long recovery process. Id. <br>
  According to the experts, the early stage of <br>
  recovery can last several years; in addition, it takes typically<br>
  five to ten years before recovery from sex <br>
  addiction becomes self-sustaining. Id. Petitioner remains at risk<br>
  of a relapse, since relapse is a significant <br>
  problem during the early stage of recovery and a feature of any<br>
  addictive illness. Id. at 12 - 13. There <br>
  exists a risk to his acting out sexually in the physician-patient<br>
  relationship. Id. at 13.</p>
<p><br>
  C. Petitioner's license was revoked for reasons bearing on his<br>
  professional competence or performance.</p>
<p> The I.G. asks that I find: </p>
<p> Revoking petitioner's license for recklessly disregarding the<br>
  truth when completing his licensure <br>
  application is a revocation of petitioner's license for reasons<br>
  bearing on his professional performance.</p>
<p>I.G. Br. at 6 (proposed finding 16). The I.G. relies on Eric<br>
  Kranz, M.D., DAB CR148 (1991), aff'd DAB <br>
  1286 (1991). The I.G. notes that the license revocation at issue<br>
  in the Kranz case was also partially caused <br>
  by false statements on a license application form. I.G. Br. at 17. <br>
  The I.G. quotes language from the <br>
  appellate panel's decision and suggests that Kranz is controlling.<br>
  &#338;Petitioner, like the I.G., looks at the false answer as an<br>
  abstraction and asks that I find:</p>
<p> Revoking Petitioner's license for recklessly disregarding the<br>
  truth when completing his licensure <br>
  application is not a revocation of petitioner's license for reasons<br>
  bearing on his professional performance. </p>
<p>P. Br. at 10 (proposed finding 18). Petitioner repeatedly argues<br>
  that his license was revoked &quot;for medical <br>
  reasons&quot; and because he &quot;suffered from an illness, and not that he<br>
  lacked professional competence.&quot; P. Br. <br>
  at 3, 12. I find, however, that both the I.G.'s proposed finding<br>
  quoted above and the Petitioner's <br>
  propositions are overly broad and not fully appropriate to the<br>
  facts of this case.</p>
<p>Petitioner's medical license was not revoked merely because his<br>
  application contained a false statement. <br>
  Neither the Kranz decision nor any other legal precedent directs a<br>
  conclusion that any statement on a <br>
  license application form that is false or given with reckless<br>
  disregard for the truth and causes an <br>
  individual's license to be revoked or suspended constitutes<br>
  authority for the I.G. to direct and impose an <br>
  exclusion against an individual based upon the individual's<br>
  professional competence or performance. In <br>
  Kranz, the basis of the I.G.'s exclusion under section<br>
  1128(b)(4)(A) of the Act was that West Virginia had <br>
  revoked the physician's license because he had perpetrated a<br>
  criminal act upon a hospital employee in a <br>
  hospital setting and had falsely denied in his licensure<br>
  application to West Virginia that another state <br>
  (Ohio) had rejected his application to practice medicine. Ohio<br>
  denied Dr. Kranz a medical license because <br>
  he had offered to sell questions and answers to medical<br>
  examinations, because he had falsely claimed in his <br>
  Ohio application that he was licensed to practice in Canada, and<br>
  because he had failed to disclose that <br>
  Pennsylvania and Oklahoma had denied him licenses as well. It is<br>
  the totality of these very case-specific <br>
  facts that led the administrative law judge and the appellate panel<br>
  to conclude that the license revocation in <br>
  Kranz was for reasons bearing on the doctor's professional<br>
  competence and performance. </p>
<p>I reject the I.G.'s broad proposition that &quot;`professional<br>
  competence' and `professional performance' clearly <br>
  include the requirement that health care providers honestly respond<br>
  to questions in their licensing &#338;application.&quot; I.G. R. Br. at 3. There 
  is no per se rule that<br>
  whenever a license revocation action involves a <br>
  false answer on an application form, the resultant revocation is<br>
  due to a reason bearing on professional <br>
  competence or performance. Some false or incorrect answers on<br>
  application forms may have no bearing <br>
  on professional competence or performance. There is no evidence<br>
  that a state licensing authority is <br>
  prohibited from establishing rules that would authorize sanctions<br>
  for false answers of any type on an <br>
  application form -- even answers having nothing to do with<br>
  professional competence or performance. <br>
  <br>
  However, on the facts of this case, Petitioner's license was<br>
  revoked for reasons bearing on his professional <br>
  competence or performance because he had twice given a false answer<br>
  to a question concerning his ability <br>
  to practice medicine. The import of his false answers, and the<br>
  facts he sought to conceal, form the basis of <br>
  his exclusion under section 1128(b)(4)(A) of the Act. </p>
<p>Question 20 asked, &quot;Do you now have, or have you ever had, a<br>
  physical or mental disability which might <br>
  affect your ability to practice medicine?&quot; Judge Connick found<br>
  that Petitioner's &quot;response to question no. <br>
  20 inferred [sic] facts about the relationship between [his] mental<br>
  disability and his medical practice.&quot; I.G. <br>
  Ex. 3 at 26. By answering &quot;no,&quot; Petitioner had made himself appear<br>
  more professionally competent than <br>
  he was -- that is, he gave the impression that he could practice<br>
  medicine with safety to his patients even <br>
  though &quot;[t]he possibility of his mental condition's affecting his<br>
  medical practice was a feature of his <br>
  disability which existed at the time he completed the license<br>
  application.&quot; Id. at 26 - 27. After the true <br>
  extent of his psychosexual disorder came to light in the license<br>
  revocation hearing, there was not one <br>
  medical expert or Medical Board adjudicator who found Petitioner<br>
  capable of practicing medicine without <br>
  significant restrictions. I.G. Ex. 2, 3, 4. </p>
<p>Judge Connick found the false answer provided by Petitioner to be<br>
  part of the denial that is symptomatic of <br>
  Petitioner's addictive psychosexual disorder. Id. at 21. As<br>
  already discussed, Petitioner's false answers on <br>
  the license application and license renewal application are<br>
  intertwined with the progression of his disorder <br>
  and its impact on his practice of medicine. See also, id. at 28. <br>
  In addition, Judge Connick had especially <br>
  remarked on the falsity of Petitioner's answer to question 20 inlight of his 
  unprofessional sexual <br>
  relationship with a patient, his arousal by female patients, and<br>
  his difficulties in making differential <br>
  diagnosis by October, 1990. Those problems were of a professional<br>
  nature and resulted from Petitioner's <br>
  mental disorder. </p>
<p>The Medical Board did not modify Judge Connick's reasoning that: </p>
<p> Based on the record as a whole, [Petitioner's] false answer to<br>
  question no. 20 on his application <br>
  demonstrates that he is not qualified to practice medicine in<br>
  Colorado at this time. In addition, revocation <br>
  is the only discipline which would allow the Board the initial<br>
  opportunity missed to judge [Petitioner's] <br>
  conduct.</p>
<p>I.G. Ex. 3 at 31. This language indicates that the revocation<br>
  action was not merely intended to punish <br>
  Petitioner for a false answer on his application form. Rather,<br>
  the revocation was intended to restore the <br>
  Medical Board's opportunity to decide in the first instance<br>
  whether, based on a true answer to question 20, <br>
  Petitioner is qualified to practice medicine in the State. From<br>
  this statement, the I.G. may properly infer <br>
  that &quot;[m]aintaining the integrity of the licensing process is<br>
  integral to insuring that only qualified <br>
  practitioners are allowed to practice medicine.&quot; I.G. R. Br. at 3. <br>
  However, given the record before her and <br>
  her findings, Judge Connick was not using the phrase &quot;not qualified<br>
  to practice medicine&quot; to say that an <br>
  individual is unfit to practice medicine unless he has been<br>
  truthful in all matters on his application form.</p>
<p>For all these interrelated reasons, Petitioner's license was<br>
  revoked &quot;for reasons bearing on [his] professional <br>
  competence [or] professional performance&quot; within the meaning of<br>
  section 1128(b)(4)(A) of the Act. </p>
<p>I am aware that the Medical Board, in adopting Judge Connick's<br>
  decision, found nothing lacking in <br>
  Petitioner's technical skills. I.G. Ex. 3 at 22. He was, by all<br>
  accounts, a superior medical resident. Id. <br>
  Petitioner relies on the good quality of care he has delivered in<br>
  the past to define his professional <br>
  competence and performance. P. Br. at 7. He especially notes that<br>
  the Medical Board was not critical of <br>
  the professional care that he has administered. Id. I am aware<br>
  also that Petitioner may be able to practice <br>
  medicine with safety to his patients under certain restrictivecircumstances. 
  See, e.g., I.G. Ex. 3 at 16 - 18, <br>
  29 - 31. However, these and like factors do not alter my finding<br>
  that Petitioner was properly excluded <br>
  under section 1128(b)(4)(A) of the Act. </p>
<p>Section 1128(b)(4)(A) of the Act does not permit the use of a &quot;but<br>
  for&quot; test when examining the reasons for <br>
  a license revocation. That is, the federal statute does not<br>
  require that Petitioner's license be revoked as a <br>
  direct consequence of, or solely because of, his professional<br>
  competence or performance. The revocation <br>
  decision need only have been for reasons &quot;bearing on&quot; the<br>
  enumerated factors. Here, there is adequate and <br>
  incontrovertible evidence that satisfies the &quot;bearing on&quot; standard<br>
  of section 1128(b)(4)(A).</p>
<p>With respect to Petitioner's observations that he had provided good<br>
  medical services to his patients, I note <br>
  that section 1128(b)(4)(A) does not limit exclusions to those<br>
  individuals whose licenses have been revoked <br>
  on specific findings of professional incompetence or on past<br>
  delivery of poor health care services. The <br>
  terms &quot;professional competence&quot; and &quot;professional performance&quot;<br>
  connote what has occurred in the past as <br>
  well as what may occur in the future. As already noted, despite<br>
  some very superior professional <br>
  accomplishments, Petitioner has experienced problems in the<br>
  physician-patient context, and the experts <br>
  were in agreement that his continued practice of medicine poses<br>
  risks to patients. The Act is satisfied <br>
  when, as here, the reason an individual's license was revoked has<br>
  to do with professional competence or <br>
  performance. <br>
  <br>
  Additionally, I am unable to give weight to Judge Connick's opinion<br>
  that, in the absence of the false <br>
  answers to Question 20, Petitioner should be allowed to practice<br>
  medicine under certain restrictions and <br>
  probationary conditions. I.G. Ex. 3 at 29 - 31. Section 1128(b)<br>
  of the Act provides the Secretary with only <br>
  two choices: either to exclude or not to exclude health care<br>
  providers. The Secretary, in delegating to the <br>
  I.G. this discretionary authority, announced that the I.G. will<br>
  always consider on a case-by-case basis <br>
  whether an individual presents a risk to the programs or their<br>
  beneficiaries. 57 Fed. Reg. 3303 (1992). </p>
<p>Here, the Medical Board has already concluded that the<br>
  &quot;overwhelming evidence in the record ... supports <br>
  the conclusion that [Petitioner] suffers from a mental disabilitywhich renders 
  him unable to perform <br>
  medical services with safety to the patient.&quot; I.G. Ex. 3 at 24. <br>
  The Medical Board, which had the authority <br>
  to set limitations or impose conditions on Petitioner's medical<br>
  practice, did not do so because it chose to <br>
  revoke his license instead. The I.G., by contrast, is not<br>
  authorized to limit medical practices, to require <br>
  female chaperones for physicians, or to impose any conditions for<br>
  health care providers' continued <br>
  participation in the programs. The I.G. may only exclude (or not<br>
  exclude) health care providers. In <br>
  challenging the I.G.'s decision to exclude him from further<br>
  participation in the programs, Petitioner has not <br>
  shown that the I.G. deviated from the Act or the regulations.</p>
<p><br>
  IV. CONCLUSION </p>
<p>For the foregoing reasons, the I.G. is entitled to summary judgment<br>
  in the I.G.'s favor. </p>
