  <P>The Community Relations Service (CRS), an agency of the U.S. Department of 
    Justice, was created by the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to help resolve community 
    racial conflict through non-coercive, third party conciliation. CRS is called 
    upon to assist communities to resolve disputes arising from alleged use of 
    excessive force by police. CRS conciliators have extensive experience with 
    the issues associated with racial and ethnic conflict.</P>
  <P>CRS conducts formal mediated negotiations to help resolve differences between 
    the police and community groups. In addition, CRS provides a wide range of 
    informal assistance that attempts to keep communications open among affected 
    parties and to facilitate a mutually acceptable resolution of the conflict. 
    CRS offers its services either upon request or on its own initiative, when 
    there is a threat of disruption to peaceful community relations.</P>
  <P>The Community Relations Service is headquartered in Washington, D.C., and 
    has offices in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, 
    Kansas City, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and 
    Seattle. Assistance may be requested directly from any of these offices.</P>

  <P>I am particularly concerned about racial or ethnic confrontations that could 
    get out of hand and result in violence and danger to communities.<br>
  </P>
  <P>This guidebook describes what is required to help ensure that major public 
    events run smoothly and safely.<br>
  </P>
  <P>We have successfully participated in many public events from national conventions 
    to student demonstrations. As a result, our conciliators have developed extensive 
    experience with the planning and issues involved in those events. Lessons 
    learned from these events, from the partnerships we have formed with communities, 
    and from the eight community case histories are the focus of this guidebook.<br>
  </P>
  <P>We hope that you can profit from the experience of others so that when a 
    public event comes to your city it will be as peaceful as possible.<br>

  </P>
  <P> This guide is the joint product of the Community Relations Service and representatives 
    from eight cities who faced significant issues over hosting large gatherings 
    of minority college-age youths for weekend events.</P>
  <P> Most of these cities are beach communities where annual gatherings from 
    25,000 to 150,000 youths took place. The demand on community resources was 
    significant and the prospect of increased racial tension and the possibility 
    for disorder evident.</P>
  <P> A review of the experience in these cities generated a list of potential 
    community and participant concerns. For example:<br>

  </P>
  <P>CRS will conduct an assessment and provide conciliation assistance to the 
    community and law enforcement in San Antonio, Texas. Community tensions have 
    arisen in the aftermath of racial slurs which were painted on the front doors 
    of the Prince of Peace Baptist Church on Friday, December 1, 2000. The church 
    has a black congregation. CRS will offer its expertise and guidance to address 
    the racial tensions.<br>

  <P> Recognizing "flash points" that could ignite civil disturbances is the first 
    step in contingency planning. Municipal officials, law enforcement, community 
    leaders, organizers and promoters should consider all of the possible problems 
    well in advance of a public event.</P>

  <P><b><a name="54"></a>Contingency Planning</b><br>
  </P>
  <P> The primary goal of contingency planning is to be prepared for all emergencies 
    that might negatively impact residents in a community. Contingency plans are 
    the specific written assignments of roles and functions during times of crises 
    or for major community events. Each department, public and private organization 
    should have a contingency plan. Personnel and alternates should be identified 
    as contacts for emergency access.</P>
  <P> A designated site for a command center should be part of any contingency 
    plan. The command center should have representatives from the mayor's office, 
    law enforcement, public works, fire department, and health organizations who 
    will communicate and coordinate emergency activities.</P>
  <P> Those in charge of the command center and the elected officials need to 
    know what constitutional provisions, operating policies, and State statutes 
    will be in effect when there is a public event or civil disorder condition. 
    For example:<br>
  </P>
  <UL>
    <LI>Under what circumstances does the Governor assume partial or complete 
      responsibility for civil emergencies in a local jurisdiction? What criteria 
      would be used for a determination of a state of emergency? Under what conditions 
      may the State authorities activate the National Guard or call for other 
      external law enforcement assistance? Have personnel who may be mobilized 
      for an emergency received appropriate training in the complexities and sensitivities 
      of dealing with minority-centered disputes and protest issues? Do all state 
      law enforcement agencies have policies regarding non-lethal or disabling 
      means of apprehension? Do all agencies have the same policy?</LI>
  </UL>
  <P> Before State assistance is summoned, all means of using non-coercive force 
    should be employed. Staff of the Community Relations Service, minority community 
    leaders, clergy, human relations commission, police chaplains, volunteers 
    from minority police organizations, and community volunteers should be called 
    upon to conduct conciliation and peacekeeping activities.</P>

  <P ALIGN="center"><STRONG><font size="+1"><a name="6"></a>Event Organizing and 
    Planning</font></STRONG><br>
  </P>
  <P> <STRONG><a name="61"></a>Who Is Involved in Event and Activity Planning?</STRONG></P>
  <P> The answer is everyone who can affect the outcome. This will include the 
    mayor, city manager, police, and almost every municipal department In addition, 
    the community must be mobilized and involved. Volunteers will be required. 
    Community organizations and business must be involved.</P>
  <P> The unique feature of many major events, such as Spring Break and Special 
    Events is that they bring a large number of college-age and younger people 
    to a community for the "event." These are usually minimal or few officially-sponsored 
    activities. The main "event" is to be there to walk, to cruise in cars, to 
    be seen, and to visit with other students. Thus, when the event comes to the 
    city, everyone who works for the city - regardless of their regular duties 
    - will be working on the event for that period. All of a city's resources, 
    including churches, community organizations, and volunteers will be needed. 
    The event is not solely the responsibility of the police and fire departments.<br>
  </P>
  <P> <STRONG><a name="62"></a>Pre-event Activities</STRONG><br>
  </P>
  <P> Pre-event activities involve planning by all city, police, business, community, 
    student, and promoter personnel to engage the resources necessary for a successful 
    event. At this stage potential problems should be identified and addressed. 
    Planning should occur six to nine months in advance of large events. Even 
    if a firm date is not known in the early planning stages, it is usually well 
    known that the activity will occur around a particular holiday or vacation 
    time. The exact event date can be plugged in once it is publicized. Publication 
    of exact dates is now usually accomplished through student organization Internet 
    web sites, which local officials can monitor.</P>
  <P> <STRONG>Public Forum.</STRONG> Hold public forums in the community and arrange 
    for city officials to attend community organization meetings so that community 
    residents are aware of the upcoming event and have their views included in 
    the planning. Be sure to announce the traffic plan and try to involve residents 
    in the event as volunteers. The community needs to know that there is no backdoor 
    plan or hidden agenda. Use the public forum and any other community meeting 
    to provide information. Be positive and upbeat. This is a time to show off 
    your city and make people feel welcome.</P>
  <P> <STRONG>Establish a budget.</STRONG> City and police officials will need 
    to establish a budget and identify needed equipment. Know how much you have 
    to spend and what can be volunteered or contributed from outside sources; 
    then create a community task force for planning.</P>
  <hr>
  <P><EM>"The simplest thing can spark a major problem: a fight, someone blocking 
    a driveway, or traffic. Police have to deal with the event and keep traffic 
    moving along."</EM></P>
  <br>
  <br>
  <P><b>Lt. Edward Kirschenbaum</b><br>
    Monmouth County Prosecutor's Office<br>
    Freehold, New Jersey</P>
  <hr>
  <br>
  <P> <STRONG>Establish an effective traffic plan.</STRONG> The first and most 
    important planning activity is to establish a traffic plan to handle participants, 
    affected local residents and businesses, and emergency vehicles. Have a back-up 
    plan if bottlenecks occur and traffic ceases to flow. Because many of these 
    events occur in beach communities where natural boundaries define the road 
    patterns, the options may be limited. Make work what you have. Young people 
    will want to be near the beach, along the most popular major streets, or a 
    particular park area. Experience shows that this real estate will be small 
    and access limited, so you will have to develop a plan that allows access 
    to the place everyone is trying to get to and keeps them moving through.</P>
  <P> If the traffic plan fails, major problems will arise.</P>
  <P> <STRONG>Work with media to develop a positive attitude.</STRONG> Involve 
    the media early in letting them know you are aware of the event and are beginning 
    to prepare for it. Establish a positive environment for the event. As the 
    event gets closer, press releases, briefings, and announcements can be used 
    to prepare the community.<br>
  </P>
  <P> <STRONG>Training for all who will be providing services.</STRONG> Training 
    is the key for law enforcement, volunteers/task force members, internal staff, 
    and outside agencies.</P>
  <P> What should everybody expect? Many, including outside police help and internal 
    staff members, may not know what they are going to face. Don't make assumptions 
    about what you think they should know. Tell them what to expect, because this 
    is different from most anything they have seen. Training for most of these 
    people should take place right before the event.</P>
  <P> What will be the role of each person? This is especially important for the 
    volunteers. They need to know what they are expected and not expected to do. 
  </P>
  <P> What city information do they need? Many are coming from out of town, and 
    even volunteers who live in the city may not know enough about the area to 
    be helpful to a guest coming to the event. Give them maps and hotel lists 
    of hotels, restaurants, and other sites to pass out when people start asking 
    questions.</P>
  <P> <STRONG>Recruitment and Training for Volunteers. </STRONG>Coordinate early 
    all groups who will be part of the event, so that there is no need for rushed, 
    last minute accommodation of groups seeking to join. There are several kinds 
    of volunteers that cities can recruit for large events. Volunteers are very 
    important, because they represent the face of the community and help to show 
    that the community is embracing the event. This helps to create a positive 
    feeling among the visitors to the community. Also, when local citizens are 
    involved there will be less potential resentment and hostility from local 
    residents to disruptions caused by the large numbers of visitors. The recruitment 
    and training of these volunteers should be given a high priority. Start early 
    by recruiting leaders for the volunteer groups.</P>
  <P> The kinds of volunteers who can be recruited include "friendship teams," 
    minority community or civil rights groups, police chaplains, volunteer minority 
    police officers, and local volunteers to help with water stations, medical 
    stations, and trash disposal. Local civic organizations can be invited to 
    set up food and drink stands as fundraisers.</P>
  <P> <STRONG>Establishment of Friendship Teams. </STRONG>Friendship Teams composed 
    of local citizens can be formed to hand out welcome brochures. They can also 
    help people find places to eat, identify local landmarks, find bathroom and 
    medical facilities, and provide friendly faces to greet visitors. A cadre 
    of city employees might be used as the core group of Friendship Teams.</P>
  <P> They should be provided with maps of the area and thoroughly briefed on 
    the traffic plan and event arrangements in order to guide visitors. They must 
    be instructed that if they see a problem developing such as lewd behavior, 
    public exhibitionism, fighting and so forth, to contact their leader, volunteer 
    police officers, police chaplains, or a police officer. These volunteers are 
    not police officers and should not engage in or interfere with police activity.</P>
  <P> <STRONG>Training for Police. </STRONG>Make sure that police, both local 
    and outside forces, know and understand the "philosophy of enforcement" used 
    in your community. Make sure that the "philosophy of enforcement" remains 
    the same year round. Make sure that officers know what the role of volunteers 
    will be during the event. Police also need to know how to recognize the volunteers. 
    Be sure to introduce the leaders of the volunteer groups and let them speak 
    to the officers at pre-event roll calls. Some officers may not be comfortable 
    with civilian volunteers assisting during the event.</P>

  <br>
  <P> <STRONG>Involving and Informing the Community.</STRONG> City leaders should 
    start meeting with community leaders and organizations as early as possible 
    about major events. Use the media regularly to keep the public updated on 
    event planning. Make sure that the event is a regular agenda item on city 
    council meetings and is reported on by the city manager and department heads. 
    The event should not come as a surprise to anyone in the community.</P>
  <P><STRONG> Coordination of City, County, and State Law Enforcement.</STRONG> 
    Develop your traffic plan early and identify all of the law enforcement jurisdictions 
    to be involved. In some cases, your traffic plan may involve a neighboring 
    city or county jurisdictions that will need to be made part of the planning 
    team. This coordination will be especially important to help visitors to leave 
    the city at the end of the event. Everyone who has come will try to leave 
    within a short period of time and law enforcement in all of the jurisdictions 
    along the egress routes must be prepared for an unusually high volume of traffic. 
    The welcome brochure should identify anticipated bottlenecks.</P>
  <P> The host city's police department should identify their policing priorities 
    and protocols for the event as early as possible; then brief and coordinate 
    with other law enforcement commanders. The police department should establish 
    a command post near the event site and have representatives of all of the 
    jurisdictions and the volunteer organizations at the command post. The command 
    post should be at a separate site from the police department headquarters. 
    It will need separate telephones with well-publicized telephone numbers. Remote 
    videos of the event area can be fed into the command center via microwave. 
    It should also have computers, radios, and a fax machine. City or State Human 
    Relations Commission representatives should also be used as a resource by 
    the police department. A single command post for all law enforcement and other 
    agencies is recommended. If another law enforcement organization establishes 
    a separate command post, be sure that there are liaisons from each department 
    at both command posts. </P>
  <P> Most likely, all of the city's police officers will be needed for the event 
    along with some from other jurisdictions. Develop a deployment plan that distributes 
    the officers throughout the affected area, preferably in biracial or diverse 
    teams. Encourage officers to be friendly and outgoing. Instruct officers to 
    prevent problems from occurring by keeping animals out of the site, keeping 
    traffic moving, and avoiding actions that would create attention and generate 
    rumors. Tow trucks should be moving continuously through the area to tow stalled 
    cars or illegally parked cars that block traffic. The lot to where cars are 
    towed should be nearby so that the tow trucks can return to the site quickly. 
    Cars can be recovered more quickly and easily if they are towed to a close 
    site, lessening tensions and hard feelings. When arrests are required, those 
    arrested should be moved out of the site quickly, quietly, and with as little 
    force as possible. Special arrest extraction teams and SWAT teams, especially 
    those wearing or carrying riot gear, should be kept out of sight and moved 
    carefully to avoid creating tensions with visitors. </P>
  <P> <STRONG>Total Coordination of City Services.</STRONG> The arrival of large 
    numbers of visitors for a major event will require advance planning to ensure 
    that bathroom facilities, drinking water, medical facilities, and additional 
    trash containers are provided. This may be a heavy burden on the affected 
    departments and require temporary use of personnel from other departments 
    of the city. Volunteers from other departments can fill critical gaps in the 
    schedule. Every city or county employee should be considered as a potential 
    resource. Use the event as a team building experience that will bring employees 
    and departments closer together. Make special T-shirts for the city employees 
    for the event and all similar events.</P>
  <P> Plenty of trash cans should be made available to contain and dispose of 
    all refuse. </P>
  <P> <STRONG>Develop a City Welcome Brochure.</STRONG> The welcome brochure should 
    contain a greeting from the mayor, a map of the traffic plan and a description 
    of periods when the traffic plan will be in effect, locations of water, medical, 
    bathroom facilities, and the tow lot. Include telephone numbers for police, 
    emergency services, and the towing services. Include information on local 
    laws that will be enforced. An ending time for the event should be faxed and 
    announced to allow city services to return to order for the next workday.</P>
  <P> <STRONG>Use the Internet to Keep Event Participants and Regular Tourists 
    Informed About Event Activities.</STRONG> Post information about events in 
    your city on the city web site. The welcome brochure, traffic plan, towing 
    policy, costs of towing, and local laws should all be posted on the web site. 
    In addition, city officials and police should monitor student organization 
    web sites and selected chat rooms in which students exchange information about 
    the upcoming event. This information will be useful in preparing an effective 
    traffic plan and preparing law enforcement for the event. </P>

  <P><STRONG> <a name="63"></a>Activities During the Event</STRONG><br>
  </P>
  <P> <STRONG>Police Patrols and Enforcement Activity.</STRONG> The first major 
    goal of all police activity will be implementing the traffic plan. The second 
    goal will be to enforce the local laws and prevent conflicts from occurring. 
    The policies governing these activities should be no different from those 
    at other times of the year. Keep the snakes, dogs, and exotic animals and 
    birds out of the event area, as they draw attention and create the potential 
    for crowd control problems. Have ordinances in place year-round and publish 
    them well in advance and in the welcome brochure. Post ordinance signs during 
    the event and in hotel rooms.</P>
  <P> Use plainclothes officers to reduce the number of uniforms among the crowd. 
    Participants may become uneasy if they feel there is an excessive police presence. 
    The majority of uniformed officers should be in marked cars directing traffic 
    and on visible patrol. Use enough uniformed officers to let the crowd know 
    that police are present to help maintain order, but not to raise crowd tensions. 
    Be sensitive to how the crowds are responding to your officers. Use plainclothes 
    officers and volunteers to help monitor and report on the mood and behavior 
    of the crowd. A video surveillance system, if available, can help command 
    officers gain an overall picture of the event and make appropriate deployment 
    decisions. </P>
  <P> Lewd behavior and other acts of public exhibitionism may occur. People will 
    try to videotape this behavior and crowds will be drawn to the area. Disrobing 
    women are vulnerable to theft of clothes, purses, money, and sexual attacks. 
    Officers can prevent this by maintaining regular patrols of diverse teams 
    of officers throughout the area who take action immediately. Plainclothes 
    officers should be firm and fair. Make arrests only when absolutely necessary 
    and use extraction teams to remove those arrested quickly out of the area. 
    The volunteer police, police chaplains, and community teams will be very helpful 
    in encouraging youth to behave appropriately. They can say and do a lot to 
    ease tensions in these situations. </P>
  <P> If stage performers engage in lewd behavior, expect it to be mimicked throughout 
    the crowd. The situation may deteriorate into an uncontrollable situation, 
    if you attempt to make arrests in the crowd. Instead, inform the performers 
    in advance that any disrobing or lewd behavior will result in their removal 
    and arrest. Enforce this strictly.</P>
  <P> The biggest challenge will come from local people who use the event as cover 
    for criminal activities. The large number of people allows criminals to mix 
    in while the police are busy with crowd and traffic control. </P>
  <P> <STRONG>Keep Traffic Moving.</STRONG> Typically between 2:00 a.m. and 6:00 
    a.m. the police need to control cruising. There are minimal arrests during 
    this period. When traffic stops moving, crowd control issues arise; tempers 
    can flare and fights start, and pedestrian traffic can swell beyond capacity. 
    Crime tends to increase during these situations. Remove parked cars that block 
    traffic immediately. Do not allow double parking. Do not allow cars traveling 
    in opposite directions to stop so occupants can talk with one another. Students 
    will cruise, but keep them moving. Instruct your officers to be firm, but 
    remain pleasant in their demeanor. When cars are towed, ensure that all officers 
    and volunteers know where towed cars are taken and give them clear instructions 
    to hand out to dispossessed motorists.</P>
  <P> <STRONG>Employee and Volunteer Schedules.</STRONG> Keep the volunteer schedule 
    reasonable. Do not underestimate the wear and tear of such events on volunteers. 
    Shifts of 10-12 hours may be routine for employees during these events, but 
    a 4-hour shift for volunteers is more reasonable.</P>
  <P> Be sure that employees and volunteers are well fed. Arrange for a central 
    food station (sandwiches, chips, cookies, and sodas or juice may be all that 
    is needed). If possible, arrange for hot meals; but at least have the basics 
    available. Rotate staff from their stations to get rest, go to the bathroom, 
    and get something to eat and drink. During the summer it is especially important 
    to ensure that staff has enough fluids. Hotel and motel associations or other 
    community organizations may offer welcome hospitality rooms.</P>
  <P> <STRONG>Trash. </STRONG> Ensure that sufficient trash cans and temporary 
    receptacles are placed throughout the event area and that extra receptacles 
    are placed in the heaviest visitor traffic areas. Check the trash cans regularly. 
    Remove and tie-off full bags and place them nearby for later pickup. Replace 
    with fresh bags. This will help keep your event area clean and encourage the 
    visitors to be neat and clean. Arrange for trash to be picked up a couple 
    of times during the event during periods when the fewest number of people 
    will be present. Between 6:00 and 9:00 a.m. and mid-afternoon before car and 
    pedestrian traffic gets heavy, will probably be the best times for trash pickup.</P>
  <P> City street sweepers and trash trucks can be posted at key locations clearly 
    visible from the event site near the ending time of the event. This will signal 
    the conclusion of the event and the start of the clean up and unblocking of 
    roads to get the city back into shape for the next work day.</P>
  <P> <STRONG>Use of the Community Relations Service, U.S. Department of Justice.</STRONG> 
    CRS deploy biracial teams to event sites to assist in identifying potential 
    conflict situations and to facilitate communication between event organizers, 
    visitors and law enforcement. CRS can provide guidance on preventing conflict 
    and restoring calm, and facilitating communication among the community, visitors, 
    and officials. <br>
  </P>
  <P><STRONG> <a name="64"></a>After-Event Activities</STRONG> <br>
  </P>
  <P> <STRONG>Get the City Back in Order as Soon as Possible</STRONG>. By the 
    end of a special events activity, the community will be ready to take a breather 
    and recover. Return to normal traffic patterns as soon as possible. Have street 
    sweepers and sanitation workers clean streets and remove trash as soon as 
    possible, beginning immediately after the event.</P>
  <P> Ensure that city employees and police get rest. All of those who helped 
    with your event, from volunteers to police, will be tired. Set a schedule 
    that will bring fresh officers and employees to work when the normal routine 
    returns and allow the others to get rest. You will need many of these same 
    people next year. Be sure to take care of them so that they will be ready 
    to join the team for the next event.</P>
  <P> <STRONG>Survey Opinions of Workers and Volunteers.</STRONG> Immediately 
    after the event ask everyone to record their thoughts and recommendations. 
    Arrange for each department head and other leaders to fully debrief the experience. 
    Report findings to the city manager, mayor and other officials. <STRONG>Be 
    Sure to Thank Everyone. </STRONG> City officials and the Chief of Police should 
    thank all leaders, volunteers, organizations, and outside departments who 
    contributed to the success of the event. Do this as soon as possible after 
    the event.</P>

  <P> <STRONG><a name="71"></a>Asbury Park and Belmar, New Jersey.</STRONG> For 
    more than 25 years, Greekfest Weekend has been an unsponsored annual week-long 
    event in which 30,000 to 70,000 members of African American and Latino fraternities 
    and sororities from across the country come together for a celebration at 
    the Monmouth County, New Jersey, shores. The main event attended by approximately 
    100,000 members starts in the Fairmont park area of Philadelphia (see description 
    of the Philadelphia event below) as an officially sponsored event. It usually 
    ends on Saturday night in early June, and many members want then to spend 
    a relaxing weekend at the shore.</P>
  <P> For the first 25 years this gathering was held in the Belmar area of New 
    Jersey. After a concerted effort, it was moved in 1997 from Belmar to Asbury 
    Park, where it was welcomed enthusiastically. The Monmouth County Prosecutor's 
    Office and the Monmouth County Human Relations Commission of New Jersey have 
    worked proactively with the attendees and law enforcement.<br>

    <LI>Law Enforcement<br>
      Police should have available a large number of officers ready to report 
      within minutes if an emergency develops. Put plainclothes officers in the 
      crowd to handle assaults and to catch more criminals. This also cuts down 
      the number of visible uniforms in the crowd. Use shift schedules for police 
      officers to lessen fatigue on hot afternoons and late at night. A helicopter 
      can be used to videotape the event for review and planning purposes. Avoid 
      having too many officers in riot gear appearing in the area, because it 
      creates crowd tension.<br>
    </LI>
    <LI>Traffic Plans<br>
      Police set up temporary digital road signs alongside the road several days 
      before the event to alert drivers of road changes during the upcoming event. 
      Municipal planners alerted mass transportation authorities of the event 
      so that they had enough cars on the nearby light rail system and buses on 
      routes to the event site. <br>

      Municipal planners developed a welcome brochure with maps and a copy of 
      local laws that would be enforced. </LI>

      A specific ending time on Sunday afternoon was set. Street sweepers and

      take advantage of the special traffic plans. </LI>

  <P> <STRONG><a name="72"></a>Atlanta, Georgia.</STRONG> Black College Spring 
    Break began in 1982 when eight college students from Washington, D.C., organized 
    a picnic in John A. White Park, a small park in Southwest Atlanta. In 1983 
    the "the D.C. Metro Club," consisting of 50-60 students, held activities on 
    the Atlanta University Campus and named the Spring Break Weekend "Freaknik." 
    By1988 it had grown to fill Piedmont Park and downtown Atlanta streets, impacting 
    traffic and emergency responses by police, fire and rescue personnel. It became 
    a car cruising event drawing students from many States resulting in traffic 
    gridlock, destruction of hotel rooms, lewd behavior, and crime. In 1993, the 
    mayor of Atlanta, rejected the event and many hotels did not accept reservations 
    from Black youth. The youths came nevertheless, and the city has worked hard 
    to create a positive environment renaming it "Black College Weekend," and 
    introducing the Sweet Auburn Festival. A local Black college has sponsored 
    a job fair, which has drawn up to 70,000 serious youths. The city has enacted 
    special traffic plans and patrols to address traffic congestion and "Freaknik" 
    behavior, improving both the reception and outcome of the event.<br>

      At the beginning of each year police commanders must block off the third 
      weekend in April and advise officers that they should expect to be working 
      during that time.<br>
      <br>
      The Police Department should have a statistician on-duty during the event 
      to document all arrests and citations, so that the department can identify 
      specific patterns of criminal activity. Most of those arrested were local. 
      However, some gangs came from as far away as California. Statistics were 
      faxed into headquarters every two hours. They were compiled to show resident, 
      non-resident, juvenile, adult, felony, and misdemeanor arrests. When there 
      were mass arrests, processing was done away from the event area. When cars 
      were impounded and towed or when people were arrested, an information sheet 
      on recovering their cars or their court dates was provided. The municipal 
      courts were open on Saturday and Sunday during the event to accommodate 
      visitors.<br>
    </LI>
    <LI>Traffic Plan<br>
      After precinct commanders met and developed the traffic plan, they presented 
      the plan to the mayor's staff and city council members. Once approved, it 
      was presented to other law enforcement agencies, media, clergy, and neighborhood 
      and community groups. The plan was modified again after consulting with 
      other law enforcement agencies and the community. A hotline was established 
      to help local residents get to other important events such as weddings and 
      funerals. The hotline was also used to dispel rumors.</LI>
    <LI>Volunteers<br>
      The Mayor's Office of Community Affairs and the Atlanta Police Department 
      Chaplaincy created a "Friendship Team" to act as goodwill ambassadors for 
      Black College Spring Break. The Team served as the official welcome committee 
      for college students. The Team maintained a presence throughout event venues 
      and other sites in the city, local malls, Underground Atlanta, parks, and 
      main traffic corridors. The Team also acted as additional eyes and ears 
      throughout the city, reporting suspicious activity and behavior to police 
      immediately. Friendship Teams came from all areas of Atlanta, and were divided 
      into venue teams. Bright-colored T-shirts and caps identified team members. 
      The Team's shirt and cap were shown to all police officers at a police roll 
      call on the day of the event to ensure that the team was recognized by all 
      police officers. Team members were required to attend an orientation session. 
      Orientation included a discussion of the mission and duties of the Team, 
      role of team leaders, information on venues, interpersonal skills, and safety. 
      A Friendship Team Command Center was established for registration, daily 
      briefings throughout the event, and communication from venues. Communication 
      from each venue was reported hourly or as needed. Reports included: crowd 
      information, incidents, city service needs, and meals for team members.

    <LI>Event Planning<br>
      A Special Events Committee was established to plan for this and similar 
      events. The committee was composed of representatives of the police department, 
      MARTA transit police and operations personnel, city services departments 
      (public works, sanitation, parks and recreation, traffic, and transportation), 
      Emergency Medical Service, fire department, and the representatives and 
      sponsors of the event. The chief of police advised the command staff of 
      the city administration's position on policing the event. From this the 
      traffic plan was developed for cruising and non- cruising routes during 
      the event. <br>

    Party was first celebrated in 1985 by a small number of mostly African American 
    college students from the South East Texas region. Originally named KAPPA 
    weekend and KAPPA beach party. The event grew as did the problems and challenges. 
    During the 1992 event a Galveston police officer shot and killed a man. Racial 
    tensions rose when the media and victims family charged that the officer used 
    unnecessary lethal force. Public awareness of the event grew as did negative 
    attitudes toward many of the partying visitors who were not even KAPPAS or 
    college students. With major increases in law enforcement and city resources 
    for the event, violence was reduced in 1999 with no shootings or stabbings 
    reported among the 160,000 visitors. There was more interest shown in attending 
    organized events. Also, the police use of non-confrontational techniques reduced 
    the possibility of conflict with all participants. <br>

      The police department deployed a traveling jail bus that moved where it 
      was needed to pick up persons arrested. Officers did not have to leave the 
      beach where they were needed. This maintained an adequate ratio of officers 
      to visitors. <br>
    </LI>
    <LI>Traffic Plan<br>
      The city developed a comprehensive traffic plan to accommodate residents 
      who lived near the beach and emergency vehicles. This kept the traffic moving 
      and prevented congestion. The city also provided shuttle service into the 
      entertainment district to reduce traffic congestion.<br>
    </LI>
    <LI>Entertainment District<br>
      In 1999, the city of Galveston applied to the State of Texas Land Office 
      to form an entertainment district on its seawall. They planned to use a 
      promoter to defray the taxpayer costs which had been a major complaint in 
      the past. In 2000, the city charged $20.00 per car to drive through the 
      entertainment district on the event weekend. There was no charge for pedestrians

    enthusiasts. Between 1994 and 1999, the event grew significantly, and 100,000 
    attended in 1999. Along with the small area within the boundaries of Atlantic 
    Beach, the participants of Bikefest began using other areas of the Grand Strand, 
    particularly North Myrtle Beach and South Myrtle Beach. This resulted in severe 
    traffic congestion on the only highway running along the beach.</P>
  <P> In 1992, traffic problems in the North Myrtle Beach area became so severe 
    that law enforcement developed a plan to stage officers within Atlantic Beach 
    in an attempt to control traffic and encroaching crowds of pedestrians. In 
    1997, the traffic problems and reports of unlawful conduct continued to be 
    serious. In 1998, the cities of Myrtle Beach and North Myrtle Beach requested 
    State law enforcement assistance. <br>

      They were told to enforce laws fairly and evenly. Officers were told that 
      the event was not a normal summer night. Outside officers were paired with 
      local officers. Businesses and hotels were asked to police their own sites 
      and to help make people feel welcomed. <br>

      The Chiefs of Police of Myrtle Beach, Atlantic Beach, and North Myrtle Beach 
      embraced the concept of community-policing to guide their response to the

      of the volunteer group called THE FRIENDSHIP TEAM was a major "calming effect" 
      for the event when it was established in 1999. CRS assisted in the field 
      and classroom training of the volunteers.</LI>
    <LI>Event Planning<br>
      All local governments and law enforcement agencies are part of a Memorial 
      Day Task Force, which includes the Hotel/Motel Association, the Chamber 
      of Commerce organizations, and other business organizations. The Task Force 
      starts planning for the next event as soon as the current one ends. The 
      Task Force also includes community people, which adds other perspectives 
      to the planning process. Community participation was essential because of 
      racial tensions over allegations of excessive police responses to a "Black 
      event".<br>
      <br>
      The State of South Carolina's law enforcement response for this event is 
      coordinated on the local, State, and Federal levels through the command

      entertainment presented problems. City and business organizations are learning 
      how to target items for sale to the large youth market that exists each 
      year. <br>

      Myrtle Beach merchants and hoteliers in 1999 accepted the event and presented

  <P> <STRONG><a name="76"></a>Quincy and Gretna, Florida.</STRONG> The music 
    festival began as a small party sponsored by a college Greek organization 
    in Quincy near Tallahassee. In five years it grew into an event drawing 25,000 
    people to a rural farm with a large stage for music group performances. Participants 
    have parked for miles along rural roads near the event. The event had been 
    conducted without a traffic plan and with minimal need for law enforcement 
    to direct traffic. Law enforcement activity had centered on security for performers 
    and the stage, underage drinking, driving while intoxicated, and public lewdness. 
    The event will be moving to a large site in Gretna in 2000.<br>

    <LI>Law Enforcement<br>
      Law enforcement learned that lewd behavior by participants was directly 
      associated with the behavior of stage performers. If performers behaved 
      lewdly or removed their clothes, some participants would mimic the behavior 
      creating crowd control problems. To control the situation, law enforcement 
      immediately removed performers from the stage who included lewd behavior 
      or public nudity in their performance. Advising performers of the policy 
      of removing lewd performers is now standard policy.</LI>

  <P> <STRONG><a name="77"></a>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. </STRONG>In 1974, a 
    small group of African American college students and fraternity and sorority 
    members decided to have an annual picnic in a small park in the Germantown 
    section of Philadelphia. Today it has become one of the largest college fetes 
    in the Nation. The most recent event brought as many as 100,000 participants 
    to Fairmount Park's Belmont Plateau for the culmination of a series of week-long 
    events.</P>
  <P> During the last several years, however, despite the planned events in Fairmount 
    Park, other more spontaneous weekend celebrations drew significant numbers 
    of young adults to cruise streets and flock to the South Street area.</P>
  <P> While the Fairmont Park provided a large and expansive venue for the Greeks, 
    the South Street business corridor and Center City Philadelphia was not conducive 
    for such an influx of people and had the potential for public safety problems. 
    The number of arrests for serious incidents increased significantly over the 
    last few years bringing along a new phenomena called "whirling." Whirling 
    incidents occur when a female is surrounded by a group and sexually assaulted, 
    groped, or stripped of clothing. In most cases these incidents occur within 
    a public area and sometimes within a few feet of the police, who, because 
    of the large crowds, are unable to affect an arrest or prevent such an occurrence.</P>
  <P> Planning begins in the Spring. Based upon previous years' events, police 
    commanders are in almost daily contact with community and business leaders 
    to discuss traffic related detours, street closures, security, and crowd control 
    measures. Public service announcements as well as traffic service reports 
    are broadcast in the days leading up to the weekend and on the day of the 
    event. Police focus on ensuring access to all events and providing safety 
    and protection to the Greeks and their guests.</P>
  <P> More than 1,200 uniformed and plainclothes officers were deployed throughout 
    the event sites. The heavy vehicular traffic downtown virtually shut down 
    traffic and by 1 a.m. there were 15,000 pedestrians in a seven-block area. 
    As a result, there were several unfortunate "whirling" incidents reported.</P>
  <P> There have been no legal challenges or prohibitions to the Philadelphia 
    events. Experience has shown that generally "Greeks" were not involved in 
    criminal activity and that of those arrested most were local youths and had 
    not attended college; about half were juveniles. In 2000 the Greeks plan to 
    scale back and offer only private events to members.<br>

      The city deployed a combination of volunteers and police in monitoring potential 
      problem areas. In recent years, police began videotaping the event site 
      by helicopter at different times during the event to use as training for 
      police and volunteers the following year. This was used to show typical 
      crowds at different points and specific times for appropriate deployment 
      of police and volunteers. Videotaping at the site itself has helped to reduce 
      crime, because those who have potentially come to commit crime or engage 
      in wild behavior realize that they are being taped and that the existence 
      of the tapes will help in their identifications and arrests.<br>
      <br>
      Disruptive behavior occurred despite plans by the City of Philadelphia and 
      event organizers to stage events at several venues in order to spread the 
      crowds out and avoid traffic gridlock. The Greek picnic brings about $8.5 
      million into the local economy and costs about $900,000 for police overtime 
      over the three-day weekend.<br>
      <br>
      The Philadelphia Municipal Court has established a highly successful Nuisance 
      Court at the Third Police District, which covers the South Street Corridor. 
      It addresses unruly behavior. <br>

  <P> <STRONG><a name="78"></a>Virginia Beach, Virginia.</STRONG> As early as 
    1980, groups of predominantly Black students gathered at Croatan Beach, in 
    a residential area, for a traditional beach party. The event started by word 
    of mouth by students from various universities. In 1985, the event began to 
    take a more organized appearance and promoters of individual events became 
    involved. Local residents expressed concern that Croatan lacked public facilities, 
    was too confined, and was not an adequate place for the event. In 1986, problems 
    increased because of the lack of facilities and an increase in attendance 
    to about 8,000 people. In 1987, the event moved to the resort area and the 
    large city-owned Pavilion was used for 7,500 people without incident. In 1988, 
    the 7,500 person capacity of the Pavilion was reached and there was still 
    more than 3,000 people pressing to get in. The 1988 crowd, estimated at 40,000, 
    filled local venues to capacity and caused damage to city property. During 
    September in 1988, the city began planning for the 1989 event, communicating 
    with Pan Hellenic Councils and local universities and researching how other 
    cities were handling similar events. The city created the Beachfront Events 
    Committee, which developed plans for handling large oceanfront crowds and 
    recommended to promoters of Greekfest that the event move to a large regional 
    facility; but this did not occur. Police officers received additional human 
    relations and stress management training and extra officers were assigned 
    to the resort area. Visitors were informed of local public safety ordinances. 
    During Labor Day weekend in 1989, as more than 100,000 people crowded the 
    streets, traffic became gridlocked and behavior problems flared. As tensions 
    mounted late-night rioting occurred, resulting in violence and looting. Damages 
    were estimated at $1.9 million. The city, and especially the police department, 
    was criticized by both participants and citizens for its handling of the situation.</P>
  <P> The city appointed an independent Labor Day Review commission to investigate 
    the problems and recommended a strategy for future events. Public hearings 
    allowed the community to express concerns and share suggestions. A Labor Day 
    Community Coordination Committee and a Labor Day Task Force Office was created 
    to lead the planning and implementation. Members of the police department 
    visited campuses of historically black universities and student leaders participated 
    in a three-day planning summit. Information about "Laborfest '90" was distributed 
    to student organizations. The National Black Police Officers Association and 
    local clergy provided voluntary assistance to Virginia Beach Police. Crowd 
    sizes were similar to those of 1989, but pre-planning resulted in a weekend 
    free of major incidents.</P>
  <P> Cooperative planning and improvements have continued since 1990. The City 
    Council appointed a Human Rights Commission in 1991. Several other special 
    teams and programs such as a community/visitor relations team related to the 
    event have been created. Improvements to city property to improve the situation 
    during Labor Day weekend have been accomplished.<br>

      The police department simplified and began publishing the procedure for 
      filing complaints against police officers. Now, a citizen panel reviews 
      internal investigations when a citizen is not satisfied with the police 
      department's findings. The pamphlets are distributed at all police department 
      facilities and through the public libraries, including a braille version 
      for the visually impaired. In the future, the pamphlets may be made available 
      through the city visitor center.<br>
      <br>
      The Police Department has made numerous significant changes including rewriting 
      the Civil Disturbance Mobilization Plan; redesigning the Mobile Tactics 
      approach to handle a problem while it is still small and confined; and implementing 
      specialized training in crowd management, cultural diversity, and stress 
      management. Equipment improvements include a sophisticated video system 
      that serves as a crime deterrent, to monitor traffic, to find lost children, 
      and to apprehend criminals. <br>
    </LI>
    <LI>Traffic Plan<br>
      Traffic management plans included satellite parking, free public trolley 
      transportation, and other initiatives to reduce traffic congestion. The 
      city instituted a Youth Intervention Team, made up of young adults, which 
      served as a role model and provided youth with information on events and 
      activities. This helped to reduce tension between youths. <br>
    </LI>
    <LI>Volunteers<br>
      City officials reached out to Greek organizations and college campuses for 
      assistance, developed a volunteer program, solicited help from the Black 
      Police Officers Association, City Human Rights Commission, and formed a 
      Citizens Advisory Committee. <br>
    </LI>
    <LI>Training of City Employees included law enforcement personnel.<br>
      The city conducts on-going training across all departments with special 
      programs for police officers, which include cultural diversity awareness, 
      crowd management, mob psychology, stress management, and crisis and critical 
      incident management. The police department no longer uses outside police 
      departments to assist them, and only assigns additional police officers 
      and police chaplains from their own department.<br>
    </LI>
    <LI>Entertainment and Business Policies<br>
      Organized special events, improved parking, consistent hotel registration 
      and guest policies, and other pro-active initiatives have improved the situation.</LI>

      and work toward a solution to the racial or ethnic conflict.</LI>
    <LI>If you are a participant in a CRS training session or conference, you 
      will receive timely and useful information and materials that will assist 
      you in preventing or minimizing racial adn ethnic tensions. </LI>

      within 24 hours from the time when your community notifies CRS or CRS becomes
