     Re:  Proposed Revised Inquiries for Judicial Nomination
          Application
     
Dear Messrs. Green and Cohen:

     This letter responds to your request regarding certain
inquiries you propose to include in future judicial nomination
applications for the State of Florida.  Specifically, you have
requested guidance regarding whether, in the view of the U.S.
Department of Justice, questions you propose be included on the
Florida Judicial Nominating Commission's application form are
consistent with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42
U.S.C.  12101 et seq. ("ADA"). 

     The ADA authorizes the Department of Justice to provide
technical assistance to individuals and entities having rights or
obligations under the Act.  This letter provides informal
guidance to assist you in understanding the ADA's requirements. 
However, it does not constitute a legal interpretation or legal
advice and it is not binding on the Department of Justice.

     The analysis herein is based on the Florida Judicial
Nominating Commission's status as a public entity.  Title II of
the Americans with Disabilities Act contains a sweeping
prohibition of practices by public entities that discriminate
against persons with disabilities.  42 U.S.C.  12132.  The ADA 
defines "disability" to include not only a "physical or mental
impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major
life activities of such individual," but also "a record of such
impairment" or being "regarded as having such an impairment." 
42 U.S.C.  12101(2).  

     State organizations or entities responsible for screening
applicants for possible appointment to positions in the judiciary
would fall within Title II's definition of "public entit[ies],"
and may not discriminate on the basis of disability in conducting
these activities.  See 42 U.S.C.  12131(1)(B).  The regulations
under Title II prohibit policies that unnecessarily impose
greater requirements or burdens on individuals with disabilities
in the screening process than those imposed on others.  See
28 C.F.R.  35.130(b)(6) and 35.130(b)(3)(i).  The regulations
also prohibit public entities from imposing discriminatory
"eligibility criteria."  Specifically, the regulations state the
public entities may not impose or apply eligibility criteria that
screen out or tend to screen out individuals with disabilities
from fully and equally enjoying any service, program, or
activity, unless such criteria can be shown to be "necessary" for
the provision of the service, program, or activity being offered. 
28 C.F.R.  35.150(b)(8).

     A form appended to your letter captioned "Final Revised
Copy" dated January 13, 1997, set out proposed questions numbered
"Q 10-Q 22."  We first address those questions that in our view
either require revision in order to be consistent with the ADA,
or simply require explanation.  Next, we list the remaining
proposed questions, which we find consistent with the ADA.

     Question 10

     Are you currently addicted to or dependent upon the use of
     narcotics, drugs, or intoxicating beverages?  If yes, state
     the details, including the date.

     This question would be consistent with the ADA if the
reference to use of intoxicating beverages was omitted.  Only
current illegal drug users are excluded from the Act's
protection.  See 42 U.S.C. 12210, 12212.  

     The application could contain a question linking the
applicant's use of alcohol to his or her current ability to carry
out judicial duties in a competent and professional manner.  For
example, the application could, consistent with the ADA, contain
a question that reads:  "Do you consume intoxicating beverages
such that your current ability to exercise your duties as a
member of the Judiciary is impaired or limited?"  See also
proposed Questions 12a, 12b, and 15 below (found consistent with
the ADA), which inquire about behavior which may be connected to
the abuse of alcohol. 

     Further, we note that this inquiry could be broader in one
respect.  Since current illegal drug users are not protected
under the ADA, the application could inquire about all current
illegal drug use, not just about addiction or dependence.   

     Question 11a

     During the last ten years have you been hospitalized or have
     you consulted a professional or have you received treatment
     or a diagnosis from a professional for any of the following:
     Kleptomania, Pathological or Compulsive Gambling,
     Pedophilia, Exhibitionism or Voyeurism?

     This question, and its follow-up inquiry, are consistent
with the ADA because the conditions listed are specifically
exempted from coverage by the ADA.  See 42 U.S.C.  12211.

     Question 11b

     In the past (five) (ten) years have any of the following
     occurred to you which would (significantly) interfere with
     your ability to work in a competent and professional manner?
     
          .  experiencing periods of no sleep for 2 or 3 nights
          .  experiencing periods of hyperactivity
          .  spending money profusely with extreme poor judgment
          .  suffered from extreme loss of appetite
          .  issuing checks without sufficient funds
          .  defaulting on a loan
          .  experiencing frequent mood swings
          .  uncontrollable tiredness
          .  falling asleep without warning in the middle of an
             activity

     Questions that inquire into symptoms of disability must be
linked to an applicant's current ability to carry out judicial
duties in a competent and professional manner.  This question
therefore would be consistent with the ADA only if the word
"current" were inserted before "ability to work" in the first
sentence.  

     Two of the listed behaviors -- issuing checks without
sufficient funds, and defaulting on a loan -- cannot be construed
as symptoms of disability.  Therefore, the Commission may ask
about these behaviors.  

     Question 14

     During the last ten years, have you unlawfully used
     controlled substances, narcotic drugs or dangerous drugs as
     defined by Federal and State laws?  If your answer is "Yes,"
     explain in detail.  (Unlawful use includes the use of one or
     more drugs and/or the unlawful possession or distribution of
     drugs.  It does not include the use of drugs taken under
     supervision of a licensed health care professional or other
     uses authorized by Federal law provisions).

     A person who is addicted to drugs such that his or her
ability to perform major life activities is substantially limited
is protected by the ADA -- but only if he or she is not currently
using controlled dangerous substances.  Current illegal drug
users are not protected under the ADA.  Therefore, this question
should be narrowed to inquire about current illegal drug use,
instead of during the last ten years.
  
     The Commission may ask a question about the applicant's
record of committing illegal acts generally, however, that
extends further back in time.  For example, the application could
contain a question asking whether the applicant has committed any
illegal acts in the past ten years, and could include "unlawful
use of controlled substances, narcotic or dangerous drugs as
defined by Federal and State laws" on a list of various offenses
such as misdemeanors, fraudulent acts, or other illegal acts. 
The objective is to reframe the question to ask broadly about the
applicant's record of engaging in illegal behavior, instead of
focusing only upon illegal acts that may be connected to a record
of disability.

     Question 13

     During the last ten years have you ever been declared
     legally incompetent or have you or your property been placed
     under any guardianship, conservatorship or committee?  If
     yes, give full details as to court, date and circumstances.

     This question inquires into a record of disability that may
have no impact upon an applicant's current ability to carry out
professional duties.  The inquiry should be revised to ask about
only about current competence as follows: "Have you been declared
legally incompetent or are you or your property under any
guardianship, conservatorship or committee?"

Remaining Questions Consistent With ADA

     Certain of the remaining proposed revised inquiries are not,
in the Department's view, model questions under the ADA.  These
questions are not, however, inconsistent with the ADA. 

     Question 12a

     Do you currently have a physical or mental health problem
     which in anyway impairs or limits your ability or fitness to
     properly exercise your duties as a member of the Judiciary
     in a competent and professional manner?

     Question 12b

     If your answer to the question above is Yes, are the
     limitations or impairments caused by your physical or mental
     health problem reduced or ameliorated because you receive
     ongoing treatment (with or without medication) or
     participate in a monitoring or counseling program?  Describe
     such problem and any treatment or program of monitoring or
     counseling.

     Question 15

     In the past year, have you ever been reprimanded, demoted,
     disciplined, placed on probation, suspended, cautioned or
     terminated by an employer as a result of your alleged
     consumption of alcohol, prescription drugs or illegal use of
     drugs?  If so, please state the circumstances.

     Question 16

     Within the last five years, have you ever been formally
     reprimanded, demoted, disciplined, cautioned, placed on
     probation, suspended or terminated by an employer?  If so,
     please state the circumstances under which such action was
     taken, the date(s) such action was taken, the name(s) of any
     persons who took such action, and the background and
     resolution of such action.

     Question 17

     Have any of your current or former co-workers, subordinates,
     supervisors, customers or clients ever filed a complaint or
     accusation of misconduct against you with any regulatory or
     investigatory agency, or with your employer?  If so, please
     state the date(s) of such accusation(s), the specific
     accusation(s) made, and the background and resolution of
     such action(s).

     Question 18

     Have you ever refused to submit to a test to determine
     whether you had consumed or were under the influence of
     alcohol or drugs?  If so please state the date you were
     requested to submit to such a test, type of test required,
     the name of the entity requesting that you submit to the
     test, the outcome of your refusal and the reason why you
     refused to submit to such a test.

     Question 19

     In the past year, have you failed to meet any deadline
     imposed by court order or received notice that you have not
     complied with substantive requirements of any business or
     contractual arrangement?  If so, please explain in full.

     Question 20

     In the past ten years have you suffered memory loss or
     impaired judgment for any reason?  If so, please explain in
     full.

     Question 21

     Are you currently the subject of an investigation which
     could result in civil, administrative or criminal action
     against you?  If yes, please state the nature of the
     investigation, the agency conducting the investigation and
     the expected completion date of the investigation.
     
     Question 22

     In the past ten years, have you been subject to or
     threatened with eviction proceedings?  If yes, please
     explain.

promulgate judicial nomination application forms consistent with
the ADA.  Please feel free to forward any additional materials on
