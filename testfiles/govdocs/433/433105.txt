    GENERAL PROVISIONS

-HEAD-
    Sec. 701. Findings; purpose; policy

-STATUTE-
    (a) Findings
      Congress finds that - 
        (1) millions of Americans have one or more physical or mental
      disabilities and the number of Americans with such disabilities
      is increasing;
        (2) individuals with disabilities constitute one of the most
      disadvantaged groups in society;
        (3) disability is a natural part of the human experience and in
      no way diminishes the right of individuals to - 
          (A) live independently;
          (B) enjoy self-determination;
          (C) make choices;
          (D) contribute to society;
          (E) pursue meaningful careers; and
          (F) enjoy full inclusion and integration in the economic,
        political, social, cultural, and educational mainstream of
        American society;

        (4) increased employment of individuals with disabilities can
      be achieved through implementation of statewide workforce
      investment systems under title I of the Workforce Investment Act
      of 1998 [29 U.S.C. 2801 et seq.] that provide meaningful and
      effective participation for individuals with disabilities in
      workforce investment activities and activities carried out under
      the vocational rehabilitation program established under
      subchapter I of this chapter, and through the provision of
      independent living services, support services, and meaningful
      opportunities for employment in integrated work settings through
      the provision of reasonable accommodations;
        (5) individuals with disabilities continually encounter various
      forms of discrimination in such critical areas as employment,
      housing, public accommodations, education, transportation,
      communication, recreation, institutionalization, health services,
      voting, and public services; and
        (6) the goals of the Nation properly include the goal of
      providing individuals with disabilities with the tools necessary
      to - 
          (A) make informed choices and decisions; and
          (B) achieve equality of opportunity, full inclusion and
        integration in society, employment, independent living, and
        economic and social self-sufficiency, for such individuals.
    (b) Purpose
      The purposes of this chapter are - 
        (1) to empower individuals with disabilities to maximize
      employment, economic self-sufficiency, independence, and
      inclusion and integration into society, through - 
          (A) statewide workforce investment systems implemented in
        accordance with title I of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998
        [29 U.S.C. 2801 et seq.] that include, as integral components,
        comprehensive and coordinated state-of-the-art programs of
        vocational rehabilitation;
          (B) independent living centers and services;
          (C) research;
          (D) training;
          (E) demonstration projects; and
          (F) the guarantee of equal opportunity; and

        (2) to ensure that the Federal Government plays a leadership
      role in promoting the employment of individuals with
      disabilities, especially individuals with significant
      disabilities, and in assisting States and providers of services
      in fulfilling the aspirations of such individuals with
      disabilities for meaningful and gainful employment and
      independent living.
    (c) Policy
      It is the policy of the United States that all programs,
    projects, and activities receiving assistance under this chapter
    shall be carried out in a manner consistent with the principles of -
     
        (1) respect for individual dignity, personal responsibility,
      self-determination, and pursuit of meaningful careers, based on
      informed choice, of individuals with disabilities;
        (2) respect for the privacy, rights, and equal access
      (including the use of accessible formats), of the individuals;
        (3) inclusion, integration, and full participation of the
      individuals;
        (4) support for the involvement of an individual's
      representative if an individual with a disability requests,
      desires, or needs such support; and
        (5) support for individual and systemic advocacy and community
      involvement.

      By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution
    and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to
    increase the employment of adults with disabilities to a rate that
    is as close as possible to the employment rate of the general adult
    population and to support the goals articulated in the findings and
    purpose section of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 [42
    U.S.C. 12101 et seq.], it is hereby ordered as follows:
      Section 1. Establishment of National Task Force on Employment of
    Adults with Disabilities.
      (a) There is established the "National Task Force on Employment
    of Adults with Disabilities" ("Task Force"). The Task Force shall
    comprise the Secretary of Labor, Secretary of Education, Secretary
    of Veterans Affairs, Secretary of Health and Human Services,
    Commissioner of Social Security, Secretary of the Treasury,
    Secretary of Commerce, Secretary of Transportation, Director of the

    gainful employment at a rate that is as close as possible to that
    of the general adult population. The Task Force shall develop and
    recommend to the President, through the Chair of the Task Force, a
    coordinated Federal policy to reduce employment barriers for
    persons with disabilities. Policy recommendations may cover such
    areas as discrimination, reasonable accommodations, inadequate
    access to health care, lack of consumer-driven, long-term supports
    and services, transportation, accessible and integrated housing,
    telecommunications, assistive technology, community services, child
    care, education, vocational rehabilitation, training services, job
    retention, on-the-job supports, and economic incentives to work.
    Specifically, the Task Force shall:
        (1) analyze the existing programs and policies of Task Force
      member agencies to determine what changes, modifications, and
      innovations may be necessary to remove barriers to work faced by
      people with disabilities;
        (2) develop and recommend options to address health insurance
      coverage as a barrier to employment for people with disabilities;
        (3) subject to the availability of appropriations, analyze
      State and private disability systems (e.g., workers'
      compensation, unemployment insurance, private insurance, and
      State mental health and mental retardation systems) and their
      effect on Federal programs and employment of adults with
      disabilities;
        (4) consider statistical and data analysis, cost data,
      research, and policy studies on public subsidies, employment,
      employment discrimination, and rates of return-to-work for
      individuals with disabilities;
        (5) evaluate and, where appropriate, coordinate and collaborate
      on, research and demonstration priorities of Task Force member
      agencies related to employment of adults with disabilities;
        (6) evaluate whether Federal studies related to employment and
      training can, and should, include a statistically significant
      sample of adults with disabilities;
        (7) subject to the availability of appropriations, analyze
      youth programs related to employment (e.g., Employment and
      Training Administration programs, special education, vocational
      rehabilitation, school-to-work transition, vocational education,
      and Social Security Administration work incentives and other
      programs, as may be determined by the Chair and Vice Chair of the
      Task Force) and the outcomes of those programs for young people
      with disabilities;
        (8) evaluate whether a single governmental entity or program
      should be established to provide computer and electronic
      accommodations for Federal employees with disabilities;
        (9) consult with the President's Committee on Mental
      Retardation on policies to increase the employment of people with
      mental retardation and cognitive disabilities; and
        (10) recommend to the President any additional steps that can
      be taken to advance the employment of adults with disabilities,
      including legislative proposals, regulatory changes, and program
      and budget initiatives.
      (d)(1) The members of the Task Force shall make the activities
    and initiatives set forth in this order a high priority within
    their respective agencies within the levels provided in the
    President's budget.
      (2) The Task Force shall issue its first report to the President
    by November 15, 1998. The Task Force shall issue a report to the
    President on November 15, 1999, November 15, 2000, and a final
    report on July 26, 2002, the 10th anniversary of the initial
    implementation of the employment provisions of the Americans with
    Disabilities Act of 1990 [42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.]. The reports
    shall describe the actions taken by, and progress of, each member
    of the Task Force in carrying out this order. The Task Force shall
    terminate 30 days after submitting its final report.
      (e) As used herein, an adult with a disability is a person with a
    physical or mental impairment that substantially limits at least
    one major life activity.
      Sec. 2. Specific activities by Task Force members and other
    agencies.
      (a) To ensure that the Federal Government is a model employer of
    adults with disabilities, by November 15, 1998, the Office of
    Personnel Management, the Department of Labor, and the Equal
    Employment Opportunity Commission shall submit to the Task Force a
    review of Federal Government personnel laws, regulations, and
    policies and, as appropriate, shall recommend or implement changes
    necessary to improve Federal employment policy for adults with
    disabilities. This review shall include personnel practices and
    actions such as: hiring, promotion, benefits, retirement, workers'
    compensation, retention, accessible facilities, job accommodations,
    layoffs, and reductions in force.
      (b) The Departments of Justice, Labor, Education, and Health and
    Human Services shall report to the Task Force by November 15, 1998,
    on their work with the States and others to ensure that the
    Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act

    9201 of Title 20, Education]; (4) increase access to and
    utilization of health insurance and health care for young people

    and Ready to Work Interagency Council; (5) increase participation
    by young people with disabilities in postsecondary education and
    training programs; and (6) create a nationally representative Youth
    Advisory Council, to be funded and chaired by the Department of
    Labor, to advise the Task Force in conducting these and other
    appropriate activities.
      Sec. 3. Cooperation. All efforts taken by executive departments
    and agencies under sections 1 and 2 of this order shall, as
    appropriate, further partnerships and cooperation with public and
    private sector employers, organizations that represent people with
    disabilities, organized labor, veteran service organizations, and
    State and local governments whenever such partnerships and
    cooperation are possible and would promote the employment and
    gainful economic activities of individuals with disabilities.

    benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by a party
    against the United States, its agencies, its officers, or any

    GENERAL PROVISIONS

    Sec. 718. Traditionally underserved populations

-STATUTE-
    (a) Findings
      With respect to the programs authorized in subchapters II through
    VII of this chapter, the Congress finds as follows:
      (1) Racial profile
        The racial profile of America is rapidly changing. While the
      rate of increase for white Americans is 3.2 percent, the rate of
      increase for racial and ethnic minorities is much higher: 38.6
      percent for Latinos, 14.6 percent for African-Americans, and 40.1
      percent for Asian-Americans and other ethnic groups. By the year
      2000, the Nation will have 260,000,000 people, one of every three
      of whom will be either African-American, Latino, or Asian-
      American.
      (2) Rate of disability
        Ethnic and racial minorities tend to have disabling conditions
      at a disproportionately high rate. The rate of work-related
      disability for American Indians is about one and one-half times
      that of the general population. African-Americans are also one
      and one-half times more likely to be disabled than whites and
      twice as likely to be significantly disabled.
      (3) Inequitable treatment
        Patterns of inequitable treatment of minorities have been
      documented in all major junctures of the vocational
      rehabilitation process. As compared to white Americans, a larger
      percentage of African-American applicants to the vocational
      rehabilitation system is denied acceptance. Of applicants
      accepted for service, a larger percentage of African-American
      cases is closed without being rehabilitated. Minorities are
      provided less training than their white counterparts.
      Consistently, less money is spent on minorities than on their
      white counterparts.
      (4) Recruitment
        Recruitment efforts within vocational rehabilitation at the
      level of preservice training, continuing education, and in-
      service training must focus on bringing larger numbers of
      minorities into the profession in order to provide appropriate
      practitioner knowledge, role models, and sufficient manpower to
      address the clearly changing demography of vocational
      rehabilitation.
    (b) Outreach to minorities
      (1) In general
        For each fiscal year, the Commissioner and the Director of the
      National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research
      (referred to in this subsection as the "Director") shall reserve
      1 percent of the funds appropriated for the fiscal year for
      programs authorized under subchapters II, III, VI, and VII of
      this chapter to carry out this subsection. The Commissioner and
      the Director shall use the reserved funds to carry out one or
      more of the activities described in paragraph (2) through a
      grant, contract, or cooperative agreement.
      (2) Activities
        The activities carried out by the Commissioner and the Director
      shall include one or more of the following:
          (A) Making awards to minority entities and Indian tribes to
        carry out activities under the programs authorized under
        subchapters II, III, VI, and VII of this chapter.
          (B) Making awards to minority entities and Indian tribes to
        conduct research, training, technical assistance, or a related
        activity, to improve services provided under this chapter,
        especially services provided to individuals from minority
        backgrounds.
          (C) Making awards to entities described in paragraph (3) to
        provide outreach and technical assistance to minority entities
        and Indian tribes to promote their participation in activities
        funded under this chapter, including assistance to enhance
        their capacity to carry out such activities.
      (3) Eligibility
        To be eligible to receive an award under paragraph (2)(C), an
      entity shall be a State or a public or private nonprofit agency
      or organization, such as an institution of higher education or an
      Indian tribe.
      (4) Report
        In each fiscal year, the Commissioner and the Director shall
      prepare and submit to Congress a report that describes the
      activities funded under this subsection for the preceding fiscal
      year.
      (5) Definitions
        In this subsection:
        (A) Historically Black college or university
          The term "historically Black college or university" means a
        part B institution, as defined in section 1061(2) of title 20.
        (B) Minority entity
          The term "minority entity" means an entity that is a
        historically Black college or university, a Hispanic-serving
        institution of higher education, an American Indian tribal
        college or university, or another institution of higher
        education whose minority student enrollment is at least 50
        percent.
    (c) Demonstration
      In awarding grants, or entering into contracts or cooperative
    agreements under subchapters I, II, III, VI, and VII of this
    chapter, and section 794e of this title, the Commissioner and the
    Director, in appropriate cases, shall require applicants to
    demonstrate how the applicants will address, in whole or in part,
    the needs of individuals with disabilities from minority
    backgrounds.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Findings; purpose; policy
      (1) Findings
        Congress finds that - 
          (A) work - 
            (i) is a valued activity, both for individuals and society;
          and
            (ii) fulfills the need of an individual to be productive,
          promotes independence, enhances self-esteem, and allows for
          participation in the mainstream of life in the United States;

          (B) as a group, individuals with disabilities experience
        staggering levels of unemployment and poverty;
          (C) individuals with disabilities, including individuals with
        the most significant disabilities, have demonstrated their
        ability to achieve gainful employment in integrated settings if
        appropriate services and supports are provided;
          (D) reasons for significant numbers of individuals with
        disabilities not working, or working at levels not commensurate
        with their abilities and capabilities, include - 
            (i) discrimination;
            (ii) lack of accessible and available transportation;
            (iii) fear of losing health coverage under the medicare and
          medicaid programs carried out under titles XVIII and XIX of
          the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq. and 1396 et
          seq.) or fear of losing private health insurance; and
            (iv) lack of education, training, and supports to meet job
          qualification standards necessary to secure, retain, regain,
          or advance in employment;

          (E) enforcement of subchapter V of this chapter and of the
        Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et
        seq.) holds the promise of ending discrimination for
        individuals with disabilities;
          (F) the provision of workforce investment activities and
        vocational rehabilitation services can enable individuals with
        disabilities, including individuals with the most significant
        disabilities, to pursue meaningful careers by securing gainful
        employment commensurate with their abilities and capabilities;
        and
          (G) linkages between the vocational rehabilitation programs
        established under this subchapter and other components of the
        statewide workforce investment systems are critical to ensure
        effective and meaningful participation by individuals with
        disabilities in workforce investment activities.
      (2) Purpose
        The purpose of this subchapter is to assist States in operating
      statewide comprehensive, coordinated, effective, efficient, and
      accountable programs of vocational rehabilitation, each of which
      is - 
          (A) an integral part of a statewide workforce investment
        system; and
          (B) designed to assess, plan, develop, and provide vocational
        rehabilitation services for individuals with disabilities,
        consistent with their strengths, resources, priorities,
        concerns, abilities, capabilities, interests, and informed
        choice, so that such individuals may prepare for and engage in
        gainful employment.
      (3) Policy
        It is the policy of the United States that such a program shall
      be carried out in a manner consistent with the following
      principles:
          (A) Individuals with disabilities, including individuals with
        the most significant disabilities, are generally presumed to be
        capable of engaging in gainful employment and the provision of
        individualized vocational rehabilitation services can improve
        their ability to become gainfully employed.
          (B) Individuals with disabilities must be provided the
        opportunities to obtain gainful employment in integrated
        settings.
          (C) Individuals who are applicants for such programs or
        eligible to participate in such programs must be active and
        full partners in the vocational rehabilitation process, making
        meaningful and informed choices - 
            (i) during assessments for determining eligibility and
          vocational rehabilitation needs; and
            (ii) in the selection of employment outcomes for the
          individuals, services needed to achieve the outcomes,
          entities providing such services, and the methods used to
          secure such services.

          (D) Families and other natural supports can play important
        roles in the success of a vocational rehabilitation program, if
        the individual with a disability involved requests, desires, or
        needs such supports.
          (E) Vocational rehabilitation counselors that are trained and
        prepared in accordance with State policies and procedures as
        described in section 721(a)(7)(B) of this title (referred to
        individually in this subchapter as a "qualified vocational
        rehabilitation counselor"), other qualified rehabilitation
        personnel, and other qualified personnel facilitate the
        accomplishment of the employment outcomes and objectives of an
        individual.
          (F) Individuals with disabilities and the individuals'
        representatives are full partners in a vocational
        rehabilitation program and must be involved on a regular basis
        and in a meaningful manner with respect to policy development
        and implementation.
          (G) Accountability measures must facilitate the
        accomplishment of the goals and objectives of the program,
        including providing vocational rehabilitation services to,
        among others, individuals with the most significant
        disabilities.
    (b) Authorization of appropriations
      (1) In general
        For the purpose of making grants to States under part B of this
      subchapter to assist States in meeting the costs of vocational
      rehabilitation services provided in accordance with State plans
      under section 721 of this title, there are authorized to be
      appropriated such sums as may be necessary for fiscal years 1999
      through 2003, except that the amount to be appropriated for a
      fiscal year shall not be less than the amount of the
      appropriation under this paragraph for the immediately preceding
      fiscal year, increased by the percentage change in the Consumer
      Price Index determined under subsection (c) of this section for
      the immediately preceding fiscal year.
      (2) Reference
        The reference in paragraph (1) to grants to States under part B
      of this subchapter shall not be considered to refer to grants
      under section 732 of this title.
    (c) Consumer Price Index
      (1) Percentage change
        No later than November 15 of each fiscal year (beginning with
      fiscal year 1979), the Secretary of Labor shall publish in the
      Federal Register the percentage change in the Consumer Price
      Index published for October of the preceding fiscal year and
      October of the fiscal year in which such publication is made.
      (2) Application
        (A) Increase
          If in any fiscal year the percentage change published under
        paragraph (1) indicates an increase in the Consumer Price
        Index, then the amount to be appropriated under subsection
        (b)(1) of this section for the subsequent fiscal year shall be
        at least the amount appropriated under subsection (b)(1) of
        this section for the fiscal year in which the publication is
        made under paragraph (1) increased by such percentage change.
        (B) No increase or decrease
          If in any fiscal year the percentage change published under
        paragraph (1) does not indicate an increase in the Consumer
        Price Index, then the amount to be appropriated under
        subsection (b)(1) of this section for the subsequent fiscal
        year shall be at least the amount appropriated under subsection
        (b)(1) of this section for the fiscal year in which the
        publication is made under paragraph (1).
      (3) Definition
        For purposes of this section, the term "Consumer Price Index"
      means the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, published
      monthly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

        applicable statute to carry out certain acts or make certain
        determinations which are necessary for the continuation of the
        program authorized by this subchapter, if such acts or
        determinations are required during the terminal year of such
        program, such acts and determinations shall be required during

    (a) Plan requirements
      (1) In general
        (A) Submission
          To be eligible to participate in programs under this
        subchapter, a State shall submit to the Commissioner a State
        plan for vocational rehabilitation services that meets the
        requirements of this section, on the same date that the State
        submits a State plan under section 112 of the Workforce
        Investment Act of 1998 [29 U.S.C. 2822].
        (B) Nonduplication
          The State shall not be required to submit, in the State plan
        for vocational rehabilitation services, policies, procedures,
        or descriptions required under this subchapter that have been
        previously submitted to the Commissioner and that demonstrate
        that such State meets the requirements of this subchapter,
        including any policies, procedures, or descriptions submitted
        under this subchapter as in effect on the day before August 7,
        1998.
        (C) Duration
          The State plan shall remain in effect subject to the
        submission of such modifications as the State determines to be
        necessary or as the Commissioner may require based on a change
        in State policy, a change in Federal law (including
        regulations), an interpretation of this chapter by a Federal
        court or the highest court of the State, or a finding by the
        Commissioner of State noncompliance with the requirements of
        this chapter, until the State submits and receives approval of
        a new State plan.
      (2) Designated State agency; designated State unit
        (A) Designated State agency
          The State plan shall designate a State agency as the sole
        State agency to administer the plan, or to supervise the
        administration of the plan by a local agency, except that - 
            (i) where, under State law, the State agency for
          individuals who are blind or another agency that provides
          assistance or services to adults who are blind is authorized
          to provide vocational rehabilitation services to individuals
          who are blind, that agency may be designated as the sole
          State agency to administer the part of the plan under which
          vocational rehabilitation services are provided for
          individuals who are blind (or to supervise the administration
          of such part by a local agency) and a separate State agency
          may be designated as the sole State agency to administer or
          supervise the administration of the rest of the State plan;
            (ii) the Commissioner, on the request of a State, may
          authorize the designated State agency to share funding and
          administrative responsibility with another agency of the
          State or with a local agency in order to permit the agencies
          to carry out a joint program to provide services to
          individuals with disabilities, and may waive compliance, with
          respect to vocational rehabilitation services furnished under
          the joint program, with the requirement of paragraph (4) that
          the plan be in effect in all political subdivisions of the
          State; and
            (iii) in the case of American Samoa, the appropriate State
          agency shall be the Governor of American Samoa.
        (B) Designated State unit
          The State agency designated under subparagraph (A) shall be -
        
            (i) a State agency primarily concerned with vocational
          rehabilitation, or vocational and other rehabilitation, of
          individuals with disabilities; or
            (ii) if not such an agency, the State agency (or each State
          agency if 2 are so designated) shall include a vocational
          rehabilitation bureau, division, or other organizational unit
          that - 
              (I) is primarily concerned with vocational
            rehabilitation, or vocational and other rehabilitation, of
            individuals with disabilities, and is responsible for the
            vocational rehabilitation program of the designated State
            agency;
              (II) has a full-time director;
              (III) has a staff employed on the rehabilitation work of
            the organizational unit all or substantially all of whom
            are employed full time on such work; and
              (IV) is located at an organizational level and has an
            organizational status within the designated State agency
            comparable to that of other major organizational units of
            the designated State agency.
        (C) Responsibility for services for the blind
          If the State has designated only 1 State agency pursuant to
        subparagraph (A), the State may assign responsibility for the
        part of the plan under which vocational rehabilitation services
        are provided for individuals who are blind to an organizational
        unit of the designated State agency and assign responsibility
        for the rest of the plan to another organizational unit of the
        designated State agency, with the provisions of subparagraph
        (B) applying separately to each of the designated State units.
      (3) Non-Federal share
        The State plan shall provide for financial participation by the
      State, or if the State so elects, by the State and local
      agencies, to provide the amount of the non-Federal share of the
      cost of carrying out part B of this subchapter.
      (4) Statewideness
        The State plan shall provide that the plan shall be in effect
      in all political subdivisions of the State, except that - 
          (A) in the case of any activity that, in the judgment of the
        Commissioner, is likely to assist in promoting the vocational
        rehabilitation of substantially larger numbers of individuals
        with disabilities or groups of individuals with disabilities,
        the Commissioner may waive compliance with the requirement that
        the plan be in effect in all political subdivisions of the
        State to the extent and for such period as may be provided in
        accordance with regulations prescribed by the Commissioner, but
        only if the non-Federal share of the cost of the vocational
        rehabilitation services involved is met from funds made
        available by a local agency (including funds contributed to
        such agency by a private agency, organization, or individual);
        and
          (B) in a case in which earmarked funds are used toward the
        non-Federal share and such funds are earmarked for particular
        geographic areas within the State, the earmarked funds may be
        used in such areas if the State notifies the Commissioner that
        the State cannot provide the full non-Federal share without
        such funds.
      (5) Order of selection for vocational rehabilitation services
        In the event that vocational rehabilitation services cannot be
      provided to all eligible individuals with disabilities in the
      State who apply for the services, the State plan shall - 
          (A) show the order to be followed in selecting eligible
        individuals to be provided vocational rehabilitation services;
          (B) provide the justification for the order of selection;

        selected first for the provision of vocational rehabilitation
        services; and
          (D) provide that eligible individuals, who do not meet the
        order of selection criteria, shall have access to services
        provided through the information and referral system
        implemented under paragraph (20).
      (6) Methods for administration
        (A) In general
          The State plan shall provide for such methods of
        administration as are found by the Commissioner to be necessary
        for the proper and efficient administration of the plan.
        (B) Employment of individuals with disabilities
          The State plan shall provide that the designated State
        agency, and entities carrying out community rehabilitation
        programs in the State, who are in receipt of assistance under
        this subchapter shall take affirmative action to employ and
        advance in employment qualified individuals with disabilities
        covered under, and on the same terms and conditions as set
        forth in, section 793 of this title.

        that certain buildings financed with Federal funds are so
        designed and constructed as to be accessible to the physically

          eligible individual, except those services specified in
          paragraph (5)(D) and in paragraphs (1) through (4) and (14)
          of section 723(a) of this title, the designated State unit
          will determine whether comparable services and benefits are
          available under any other program (other than a program

        responsible for the vocational rehabilitation program and other
        appropriate agencies, will ensure that an interagency agreement
        or other mechanism for interagency coordination takes effect
        between any appropriate public entity, including the State
        entity responsible for administering the State medicaid
        program, a public institution of higher education, and a
        component of the statewide workforce investment system, and the
        designated State unit, in order to ensure the provision of
        vocational rehabilitation services described in subparagraph

                  SERVICES                        
    SUBCHAPTER I - VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION SERVICES
    Part A - General Provisions

-HEAD-
    Sec. 722. Eligibility and individualized plan for employment

-STATUTE-
    (a) Eligibility
      (1) Criterion for eligibility
        An individual is eligible for assistance under this subchapter
      if the individual - 
          (A) is an individual with a disability under section
        705(20)(A) of this title; and
          (B) requires vocational rehabilitation services to prepare
        for, secure, retain, or regain employment.
      (2) Presumption of benefit
        (A) Demonstration
          For purposes of this section, an individual shall be presumed
        to be an individual that can benefit in terms of an employment
        outcome from vocational rehabilitation services under section
        705(20)(A) of this title, unless the designated State unit
        involved can demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that
        such individual is incapable of benefiting in terms of an
        employment outcome from vocational rehabilitation services due
        to the severity of the disability of the individual.
        (B) Methods
          In making the demonstration required under subparagraph (A),
        the designated State unit shall explore the individual's
        abilities, capabilities, and capacity to perform in work
        situations, through the use of trial work experiences, as
        described in section 705(2)(D) of this title, with appropriate
        supports provided through the designated State unit, except
        under limited circumstances when an individual cannot take
        advantage of such experiences. Such experiences shall be of
        sufficient variety and over a sufficient period of time to
        determine the eligibility of the individual or to determine the
        existence of clear and convincing evidence that the individual
        is incapable of benefiting in terms of an employment outcome
        from vocational rehabilitation services due to the severity of
        the disability of the individual.
      (3) Presumption of eligibility
        (A) In general
          For purposes of this section, an individual who has a
        disability or is blind as determined pursuant to title II or
        title XVI of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 401 et seq. and
        1381 et seq.) shall be - 
            (i) considered to be an individual with a significant
          disability under section 705(21)(A) of this title; and
            (ii) presumed to be eligible for vocational rehabilitation
          services under this subchapter (provided that the individual
          intends to achieve an employment outcome consistent with the
          unique strengths, resources, priorities, concerns, abilities,
          capabilities, interests, and informed choice of the
          individual) unless the designated State unit involved can
          demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that such
          individual is incapable of benefiting in terms of an
          employment outcome from vocational rehabilitation services
          due to the severity of the disability of the individual in
          accordance with paragraph (2).
        (B) Construction
          Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to create an
        entitlement to any vocational rehabilitation service.
      (4) Use of existing information
        (A) In general
          To the maximum extent appropriate and consistent with the
        requirements of this part, for purposes of determining the
        eligibility of an individual for vocational rehabilitation
        services under this subchapter and developing the
        individualized plan for employment described in subsection (b)
        of this section for the individual, the designated State unit
        shall use information that is existing and current (as of the
        date of the determination of eligibility or of the development
        of the individualized plan for employment), including
        information available from other programs and providers,
        particularly information used by education officials and the
        Social Security Administration, information provided by the
        individual and the family of the individual, and information
        obtained under the assessment for determining eligibility and
        vocational rehabilitation needs.
        (B) Determinations by officials of other agencies
          Determinations made by officials of other agencies,
        particularly education officials described in section
        721(a)(11)(D) of this title, regarding whether an individual
        satisfies one or more factors relating to whether an individual
        is an individual with a disability under section 705(20)(A) of
        this title or an individual with a significant disability under
        section 705(21)(A) of this title shall be used, to the extent
        appropriate and consistent with the requirements of this part,
        in assisting the designated State unit in making such
        determinations.
        (C) Basis
          The determination of eligibility for vocational
        rehabilitation services shall be based on - 
            (i) the review of existing data described in section
          705(2)(A)(i) of this title; and
            (ii) to the extent that such data is unavailable or
          insufficient for determining eligibility, the provision of
          assessment activities described in section 705(2)(A)(ii) of
          this title.
      (5) Determination of ineligibility
        If an individual who applies for services under this subchapter
      is determined, based on the review of existing data and, to the
      extent necessary, the assessment activities described in section
      705(2)(A)(ii) of this title, not to be eligible for the services,
      or if an eligible individual receiving services under an
      individualized plan for employment is determined to be no longer
      eligible for the services - 
          (A) the ineligibility determination involved shall be made
        only after providing an opportunity for full consultation with
        the individual or, as appropriate, the individual's
        representative;
          (B) the individual or, as appropriate, the individual's
        representative, shall be informed in writing (supplemented as
        necessary by other appropriate modes of communication
        consistent with the informed choice of the individual) of the
        ineligibility determination, including - 
            (i) the reasons for the determination; and
            (ii) a description of the means by which the individual may
          express, and seek a remedy for, any dissatisfaction with the
          determination, including the procedures for review by an
          impartial hearing officer under subsection (c) of this
          section;

          (C) the individual shall be provided with a description of
        services available from the client assistance program under
        section 732 of this title and information on how to contact
        that program; and
          (D) any ineligibility determination that is based on a
        finding that the individual is incapable of benefiting in terms
        of an employment outcome shall be reviewed - 
            (i) within 12 months; and
            (ii) thereafter, if such a review is requested by the
          individual or, if appropriate, by the individual's
          representative.
      (6) Timeframe for making an eligibility determination
        The designated State unit shall determine whether an individual
      is eligible for vocational rehabilitation services under this
      subchapter within a reasonable period of time, not to exceed 60
      days, after the individual has submitted an application for the
      services unless - 
          (A) exceptional and unforeseen circumstances beyond the
        control of the designated State unit preclude making an
        eligibility determination within 60 days and the designated
        State unit and the individual agree to a specific extension of
        time; or
          (B) the designated State unit is exploring an individual's
        abilities, capabilities, and capacity to perform in work
        situations under paragraph (2)(B).
    (b) Development of an individualized plan for employment
      (1) Options for developing an individualized plan for employment
        If an individual is determined to be eligible for vocational
      rehabilitation services as described in subsection (a) of this
      section, the designated State unit shall complete the assessment
      for determining eligibility and vocational rehabilitation needs,
      as appropriate, and shall provide the eligible individual or the
      individual's representative, in writing and in an appropriate
      mode of communication, with information on the individual's
      options for developing an individualized plan for employment,
      including - 
          (A) information on the availability of assistance, to the
        extent determined to be appropriate by the eligible individual,

          erroneous on the basis of being contrary to the approved
          State plan, this chapter (including regulations implementing
          this chapter) or any State regulation or policy that is
          consistent with the Federal requirements specified in this

        (B) Review and revision
          Effective July 1, 1999, the Commissioner shall review and, if
        necessary, revise the evaluation standards and performance
        indicators every 3 years. Any revisions of the standards and
        indicators shall be developed with input from State vocational
        rehabilitation agencies, related professional and consumer
        organizations, recipients of vocational rehabilitation
        services, and other interested parties. Any revisions of the
        standards and indicators shall be subject to the publication,

        (C) Bases
          Effective July 1, 1999, to the maximum extent practicable,
        the standards and indicators shall be consistent with the core
        indicators of performance established under section 2871(b) of
        this title.
      (2) Measures
        The standards and indicators shall include outcome and related
      measures of program performance that facilitate the
      accomplishment of the purpose and policy of this subchapter.
      (3) Comment
        The standards and indicators shall be developed with input from

      rehabilitation services, and other interested parties. The
      Commissioner shall publish in the Federal Register a notice of
      intent to regulate regarding the development of proposed
      standards and indicators. Proposed standards and indicators shall
      be published in the Federal Register for review and comment.
      Final standards and indicators shall be published in the Federal
      Register.
    (b) Compliance
      (1) State reports
        In accordance with regulations established by the Secretary,
      each State shall report to the Commissioner after the end of each
      fiscal year the extent to which the State is in compliance with
      the standards and indicators.
      (2) Program improvement
        (A) Plan
          If the Commissioner determines that the performance of any
        State is below established standards, the Commissioner shall
        provide technical assistance to the State, and the State and
        the Commissioner shall jointly develop a program improvement
        plan outlining the specific actions to be taken by the State to
        improve program performance.
        (B) Review
          The Commissioner shall - 
            (i) review the program improvement efforts of the State on
          a biannual basis and, if necessary, request the State to make
          further revisions to the plan to improve performance; and
            (ii) continue to conduct such reviews and request such
          revisions until the State sustains satisfactory performance
          over a period of more than 1 year.
    (c) Withholding
      If the Commissioner determines that a State whose performance
    falls below the established standards has failed to enter into a
    program improvement plan, or is not complying substantially with
    the terms and conditions of such a program improvement plan, the
    Commissioner shall, consistent with subsections (c) and (d) of
    section 727 of this title, reduce or make no further payments to
    the State under this program, until the State has entered into an
    approved program improvement plan, or satisfies the Commissioner
    that the State is complying substantially with the terms and
    conditions of such a program improvement plan, as appropriate.
    (d) Report to Congress
      Beginning in fiscal year 1999, the Commissioner shall include in
    each annual report to the Congress under section 710 of this title
    an analysis of program performance, including relative State
    performance, based on the standards and indicators.

      the Commissioner shall notify such State agency that no further

      organization or agency within such State or to any political
      subdivision of such State submitting a plan meeting the
      requirements of section 721(a) of this title. The Commissioner
      may not make any payment under this paragraph unless the entity
      to which such payment is made has provided assurances to the
      Commissioner that such entity will contribute, for purposes of
      carrying out such plan, the same amount as the State would have
      been obligated to contribute if the State received such payment.

      the Commissioner under section 721(b) of this title or subsection
      (c) of this section may file a petition for judicial review of
      such determination in the United States Court of Appeals for the
      circuit in which the State is located. Such a petition may be
      filed only within the 30-day period beginning on the date that
      notice of such final determination was received by the State. The
      clerk of the court shall transmit a copy of the petition to the
      Commissioner or to any officer designated by the Commissioner for
      that purpose. In accordance with section 2112 of title 28, the
      Commissioner shall file with the court a record of the proceeding
      on which the Commissioner based the determination being appealed
      by the State. Until a record is so filed, the Commissioner may
      modify or set aside any determination made under such
      proceedings.
      (2) Submissions and determinations
        If, in an action under this subsection to review a final
      determination of the Commissioner under section 721(b) of this
      title or subsection (c) of this section, the petitioner or the
      Commissioner applies to the court for leave to have additional
      oral submissions or written presentations made respecting such
      determination, the court may, for good cause shown, order the
      Commissioner to provide within 30 days an additional opportunity
      to make such submissions and presentations. Within such period,
      the Commissioner may revise any findings of fact, modify or set
      aside the determination being reviewed, or make a new
      determination by reason of the additional submissions and
      presentations, and shall file such modified or new determination,
      and any revised findings of fact, with the return of such
      submissions and presentations. The court shall thereafter review
      such new or modified determination.
      (3) Standards of review
        (A) In general
          Upon the filing of a petition under paragraph (1) for
        judicial review of a determination, the court shall have
        jurisdiction - 
            (i) to grant appropriate relief as provided in chapter 7 of
          title 5, except for interim relief with respect to a
          determination under subsection (c) of this section; and
            (ii) except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (B), to
          review such determination in accordance with chapter 7 of
          title 5.
        (B) Substantial evidence
          Section 706 of title 5 shall apply to the review of any
        determination under this subsection, except that the standard
        for review prescribed by paragraph (2)(E) of such section 706
        shall not apply and the court shall hold unlawful and set aside
        such determination if the court finds that the determination is
        not supported by substantial evidence in the record of the
        proceeding submitted pursuant to paragraph (1), as supplemented
        by any additional submissions and presentations filed under
        paragraph (2).

    Sec. 730. State allotments

-STATUTE-
    (a) Computation; additional amount; minimum amount; adjustments
      (1) Subject to the provisions of subsection (c) of this section,
    for each fiscal year beginning before October 1, 1978, each State
    shall be entitled to an allotment of an amount bearing the same
    ratio to the amount authorized to be appropriated under section
    720(b)(1) of this title for allotment under this section as the
    product of - 
        (A) the population of the State; and
        (B) the square of its allotment percentage,

    bears to the sum of the corresponding products for all the States.
      (2)(A) For each fiscal year beginning on or after October 1,
    1978, each State shall be entitled to an allotment in an amount
    equal to the amount such State received under paragraph (1) for the
    fiscal year ending September 30, 1978, and an additional amount
    determined pursuant to subparagraph (B) of this paragraph.
      (B) For each fiscal year beginning on or after October 1, 1978,
    each State shall be entitled to an allotment, from any amount
    authorized to be appropriated for such fiscal year under section
    720(b)(1) of this title for allotment under this section in excess
    of the amount appropriated under section 720(b)(1)(A) (!1) of this
    title for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1978, in an amount
    equal to the sum of - 

        (i) an amount bearing the same ratio to 50 percent of such
      excess amount as the product of the population of the State and
      the square of its allotment percentage bears to the sum of the
      corresponding products for all the States; and
        (ii) an amount bearing the same ratio to 50 percent of such
      excess amount as the product of the population of the State and
      its allotment percentage bears to the sum of the corresponding
      products for all the States.

      (3) The sum of the payment to any State (other than Guam,
    American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of the
    Northern Mariana Islands) under this subsection for any fiscal year
    which is less than  1/3  of 1 percent of the amount appropriated
    under section 720(b)(1) of this title, or $3,000,000, whichever is
    greater, shall be increased to that amount, the total of the
    increases thereby required being derived by proportionately
    reducing the allotment to each of the remaining such States under
    this subsection, but with such adjustments as may be necessary to
    prevent the sum of the allotments made under this subsection to any
    such remaining State from being thereby reduced to less than that
    amount.
    (b) Unused funds; redistribution; increase in amount
      (1) Not later than 45 days prior to the end of the fiscal year,
    the Commissioner shall determine, after reasonable opportunity for
    the submission to the Commissioner of comments by the State agency
    administering or supervising the program established under this
    subchapter, that any payment of an allotment to a State under
    section 731(a) of this title for any fiscal year will not be
    utilized by such State in carrying out the purposes of this
    subchapter.
      (2) As soon as practicable but not later than the end of the
    fiscal year, the Commissioner shall make such amount available for
    carrying out the purposes of this subchapter to one or more other
    States to the extent the Commissioner determines such other State
    will be able to use such additional amount during that fiscal year
    or the subsequent fiscal year for carrying out such purposes. The
    Commissioner shall make such amount available only if such other
    State will be able to make sufficient payments from non-Federal
    sources to pay for the non-Federal share of the cost of vocational
    rehabilitation services under the State plan for the fiscal year
    for which the amount was appropriated.
      (3) For the purposes of this part, any amount made available to a
    State for any fiscal year pursuant to this subsection shall be
    regarded as an increase of such State's allotment (as determined
    under the preceding provisions of this section) for such year.
    (c) Funds for American Indian vocational rehabilitation services
      (1) For fiscal year 1987 and for each subsequent fiscal year, the
    Commissioner shall reserve from the amount appropriated under
    section 720(b)(1) of this title for allotment under this section a
    sum, determined under paragraph (2), to carry out the purposes of
    part C of this subchapter.
      (2) The sum referred to in paragraph (1) shall be, as determined
    by the Secretary - 
        (A) not less than three-quarters of 1 percent and not more than
      1.5 percent of the amount referred to in paragraph (1), for
      fiscal year 1999; and
        (B) not less than 1 percent and not more than 1.5 percent of
      the amount referred to in paragraph (1), for each of fiscal years
      2000 through 2003.

    Sec. 731. Payments to States

-STATUTE-
    (a) Amount
      (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), from each State's
    allotment under this part for any fiscal year, the Commissioner
    shall pay to a State an amount equal to the Federal share of the
    cost of vocational rehabilitation services under the plan for that
    State approved under section 721 of this title, including
    expenditures for the administration of the State plan.
      (2)(A) The total of payments under paragraph (1) to a State for a
    fiscal year may not exceed its allotment under subsection (a) of
    section 730 of this title for such year.
      (B) For fiscal year 1994 and each fiscal year thereafter, the
    amount otherwise payable to a State for a fiscal year under this
    section shall be reduced by the amount by which expenditures from
    non-Federal sources under the State plan under this subchapter for
    the previous fiscal year are less than the total of such
    expenditures for the second fiscal year preceding the previous
    fiscal year.
      (C) The Commissioner may waive or modify any requirement or
    limitation under subparagraph (B) or section 721(a)(17) of this
    title if the Commissioner determines that a waiver or modification
    is an equitable response to exceptional or uncontrollable
    circumstances affecting the State.
      (3)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the amount of a
    payment under this section with respect to any construction project
    in any State shall be equal to the same percentage of the cost of
    such project as the Federal share that is applicable in the case of
    rehabilitation facilities (as defined in section 291o(g) of title
    42), in such State.
      (B) If the Federal share with respect to rehabilitation
    facilities in such State is determined pursuant to section
    291o(b)(2) of title 42, the percentage of the cost for purposes of
    this section shall be determined in accordance with regulations
    prescribed by the Commissioner designed to achieve as nearly as
    practicable results comparable to the results obtained under such
    section.
    (b) Method of computation and payment
      The method of computing and paying amounts pursuant to subsection
    (a) of this section shall be as follows:
        (1) The Commissioner shall, prior to the beginning of each
      calendar quarter or other period prescribed by the Commissioner,
      estimate the amount to be paid to each State under the provisions
      of such subsection for such period, such estimate to be based on
      such records of the State and information furnished by it, and
      such other investigation as the Commissioner may find necessary.
        (2) The Commissioner shall pay, from the allotment available
      therefor, the amount so estimated by the Commissioner for such
      period, reduced or increased, as the case may be, by any sum (not
      previously adjusted under this paragraph) by which the
      Commissioner finds that the estimate of the amount to be paid the
      State for any prior period under such subsection was greater or
      less than the amount which should have been paid to the State for
      such prior period under such subsection. Such payment shall be
      made prior to audit or settlement by the Government
      Accountability Office, shall be made through the disbursing
      facilities of the Treasury Department, and shall be made in such
      installments as the Commissioner may determine.

    Sec. 732. Client assistance program

-STATUTE-
    (a) Establishment of grant program
      From funds appropriated under subsection (h) of this section, the
    Secretary shall, in accordance with this section, make grants to
    States to establish and carry out client assistance programs to
    provide assistance in informing and advising all clients and client
    applicants of all available benefits under this chapter, and, upon
    request of such clients or client applicants, to assist and
    advocate for such clients or applicants in their relationships with
    projects, programs, and services provided under this chapter,
    including assistance and advocacy in pursuing legal,
    administrative, or other appropriate remedies to ensure the
    protection of the rights of such individuals under this chapter and
    to facilitate access to the services funded under this chapter
    through individual and systemic advocacy. The client assistance
    program shall provide information on the available services and
    benefits under this chapter and title I of the Americans with
    Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12111 et seq.) to individuals
    with disabilities in the State, especially with regard to
    individuals with disabilities who have traditionally been unserved
    or underserved by vocational rehabilitation programs. In providing
    assistance and advocacy under this subsection with respect to
    services under this subchapter, a client assistance program may
    provide the assistance and advocacy with respect to services that
    are directly related to facilitating the employment of the
    individual.
    (b) Existence of State program as requisite to receiving payments
      No State may receive payments from its allotment under this
    chapter in any fiscal year unless the State has in effect not later
    than October 1, 1984, a client assistance program which - 
        (1) has the authority to pursue legal, administrative, and
      other appropriate remedies to ensure the protection of rights of
      individuals with disabilities who are receiving treatments,
      services, or rehabilitation under this chapter within the State;
      and
        (2) meets the requirements of designation under subsection (c)
      of this section.
    (c) Designation of agency to conduct program
      (1)(A) The Governor shall designate a public or private agency to
    conduct the client assistance program under this section. Except as
    provided in the last sentence of this subparagraph, the Governor
    shall designate an agency which is independent of any agency which
    provides treatment, services, or rehabilitation to individuals
    under this chapter. If there is an agency in the State which has,
    or had, prior to February 22, 1984, served as a client assistance
    agency under this section and which received Federal financial
    assistance under this chapter, the Governor may, in the initial
    designation, designate an agency which provides treatment,
    services, or rehabilitation to individuals with disabilities under
    this chapter.
      (B)(i) The Governor may not redesignate the agency designated
    under subparagraph (A) without good cause and unless - 
        (I) the Governor has given the agency 30 days notice of the
      intention to make such redesignation, including specification of
      the good cause for such redesignation and an opportunity to
      respond to the assertion that good cause has been shown;
        (II) individuals with disabilities or the individuals'
      representatives have timely notice of the redesignation and
      opportunity for public comment; and
        (III) the agency has the opportunity to appeal to the
      Commissioner on the basis that the redesignation was not for good
      cause.

      (ii) If, after August 7, 1998 - 
        (I) a designated State agency undergoes any change in the
      organizational structure of the agency that results in the
      creation of one or more new State agencies or departments or
      results in the merger of the designated State agency with one or
      more other State agencies or departments; and
        (II) an agency (including an office or other unit) within the
      designated State agency was conducting a client assistance
      program before the change under the last sentence of subparagraph
      (A),

    the Governor shall redesignate the agency conducting the program.
    In conducting the redesignation, the Governor shall designate to
    conduct the program an agency that is independent of any agency
    that provides treatment, services, or rehabilitation to individuals
    with disabilities under this chapter.
      (2) In carrying out the provisions of this section, the Governor
    shall consult with the director of the State vocational
    rehabilitation agency, the head of the developmental disability
    protection and advocacy agency, and with representatives of
    professional and consumer organizations serving individuals with
    disabilities in the State.
      (3) The agency designated under this subsection shall be
    accountable for the proper use of funds made available to the
    agency.
    (d) Class action by designated agency prohibited
      The agency designated under subsection (c) of this section may
    not bring any class action in carrying out its responsibilities
    under this section.
    (e) Allotment and reallotment of funds
      (1)(A) The Secretary shall allot the sums appropriated for each
    fiscal year under this section among the States on the basis of
    relative population of each State, except that no State shall
    receive less than $50,000.
      (B) The Secretary shall allot $30,000 each to American Samoa,
    Guam, the Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of the Northern
    Mariana Islands.
      (C) For the purpose of this paragraph, the term "State" does not
    include American Samoa, Guam, the Virgin Islands, and the
    Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.
      (D)(i) In any fiscal year that the funds appropriated for such
    fiscal year exceed $7,500,000, the minimum allotment shall be
    $100,000 for States and $45,000 for territories.
      (ii) For any fiscal year in which the total amount appropriated
    under subsection (h) of this section exceeds the total amount
    appropriated under such subsection for the preceding fiscal year,
    the Secretary shall increase each of the minimum allotments under
    clause (i) by a percentage that shall not exceed the percentage
    increase in the total amount appropriated under such subsection
    between the preceding fiscal year and the fiscal year involved.
      (2) The amount of an allotment to a State for a fiscal year which
    the Secretary determines will not be required by the State during
    the period for which it is available for the purpose for which
    allotted shall be available for reallotment by the Secretary at
    appropriate times to other States with respect to which such a
    determination has not been made, in proportion to the original
    allotments of such States for such fiscal year, but with such
    proportionate amount for any of such other States being reduced to
    the extent it exceeds the sum the Secretary estimates such State
    needs and will be able to use during such period, and the total of
    such reduction shall be similarly reallotted among the States whose
    proportionate amounts were not so reduced. Any such amount so
    reallotted to a State for a fiscal year shall be deemed to be a
    part of its allotment for such fiscal year.
      (3) Except as specifically prohibited by or as otherwise provided
    in State law, the Secretary shall pay to the agency designated
    under subsection (c) of this section the amount specified in the
    application approved under subsection (f) of this section.
    (f) Application by State for grant funds
      No grant may be made under this section unless the State submits
    an application to the Secretary at such time, in such manner, and
    containing or accompanied by such information as the Secretary
    deems necessary to meet the requirements of this section.
    (g) Regulations; minimum requirements

    client assistance program which shall include the following
    requirements:

      serve as staff or consultants of any rehabilitation project,
      program, or facility receiving assistance under this chapter in
      the State.
        (2) Each program shall be afforded reasonable access to
      policymaking and administrative personnel in the State and local
      rehabilitation programs, projects, or facilities.
        (3)(A) Each program shall contain provisions designed to assure
      that to the maximum extent possible alternative means of dispute
      resolution are available for use at the discretion of an
      applicant or client of the program prior to resorting to
      litigation or formal adjudication to resolve a dispute arising
      under this section.
        (B) In subparagraph (A), the term "alternative means of dispute
      resolution" means any procedure, including good faith
      negotiation, conciliation, facilitation, mediation, factfinding,
      and arbitration, and any combination of procedures, that is used
      in lieu of litigation in a court or formal adjudication in an
      administrative forum, to resolve a dispute arising under this
      section.
        (4) For purposes of any periodic audit, report, or evaluation
      of the performance of a client assistance program under this
      section, the Secretary shall not require such a program to
      disclose the identity of, or any other personally identifiable
      information related to, any individual requesting assistance
      under such program.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 741. Vocational rehabilitation services grants

-STATUTE-
    (a) Governing bodies of Indian tribes; amount; non-Federal share
      The Commissioner, in accordance with the provisions of this part,
    may make grants to the governing bodies of Indian tribes located on
    Federal and State reservations (and consortia of such governing
    bodies) to pay 90 percent of the costs of vocational rehabilitation
    services for American Indians who are individuals with disabilities
    residing on or near such reservations. The non-Federal share of
    such costs may be in cash or in kind, fairly valued, and the
    Commissioner may waive such non-Federal share requirement in order
    to carry out the purposes of this chapter.
    (b) Application; effective period; continuation of programs and
      services; separate service delivery systems
      (1) No grant may be made under this part for any fiscal year
    unless an application therefor has been submitted to and approved
    by the Commissioner. The Commissioner may not approve an
    application unless the application - 
        (A) is made at such time, in such manner, and contains such
      information as the Commissioner may require;
        (B) contains assurances that the rehabilitation services
      provided under this part to American Indians who are individuals
      with disabilities residing on or near a reservation in a State
      shall be, to the maximum extent feasible, comparable to
      rehabilitation services provided under this subchapter to other
      individuals with disabilities residing in the State and that,
      where appropriate, may include services traditionally used by
      Indian tribes; and
        (C) contains assurances that the application was developed in
      consultation with the designated State unit of the State.

      (2) The provisions of sections 450c, 450d, 450e, and 450f(a) of
    title 25 shall be applicable to any application submitted under
    this part. For purposes of this paragraph, any reference in any
    such provision to the Secretary of Education or to the Secretary of
    the Interior shall be considered to be a reference to the
    Commissioner.
      (3) Any application approved under this part shall be effective
    for not more than 60 months, except as determined otherwise by the
    Commissioner pursuant to prescribed regulations. The State shall
    continue to provide vocational rehabilitation services under its
    State plan to American Indians residing on or near a reservation
    whenever such State includes any such American Indians in its State
    population under section 730(a)(1) of this title.
      (4) In making grants under this part, the Secretary shall give
    priority consideration to applications for the continuation of
    programs which have been funded under this part.
      (5) Nothing in this section may be construed to authorize a
    separate service delivery system for Indian residents of a State
    who reside in non-reservation areas.
    (c) "Reservation" defined
      The term "reservation" includes Indian reservations, public
    domain Indian allotments, former Indian reservations in Oklahoma,
    and land held by incorporated Native groups, regional corporations,
    and village corporations under the provisions of the Alaska Native
    Claims Settlement Act [43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.].

    The resources of the President's Committees on Employment of People
    With Disabilities and on Mental Retardation shall be made fully
    available to the Committee. It shall be the purpose and function of
    the Committee (1) to provide a focus for Federal and other
    employment of individuals with disabilities, and to review, on a
    periodic basis, in cooperation with the Commission, the adequacy of
    hiring, placement, and advancement practices with respect to
    individuals with disabilities, by each department, agency, and
    instrumentality in the executive branch of Government and the
    Smithsonian Institution, and to insure that the special needs of
    such individuals are being met; and (2) to consult with the

    instrumentality, or Institution. Such plan shall include a
    description of the extent to which and methods whereby the special
    needs of employees who are individuals with disabilities are being

    provide adequate hiring, placement, and advancement opportunities
    for individuals with disabilities.
    (c) State agencies; rehabilitated individuals, employment
      The Commission, after consultation with the Committee, shall

    facilitate the hiring, placement, and advancement in employment of
    individuals who have received rehabilitation services under State
    vocational rehabilitation programs, veterans' programs, or any
    other program for individuals with disabilities, including the
    promotion of job opportunities for such individuals. The Secretary
    shall encourage such State agencies to adopt and implement such
    policies and procedures.

    recommendations as to legislation which have been submitted to the
    Commission under subsection (a) of this section, or other
    appropriate action to insure the adequacy of such practices. Such
    report shall also include an evaluation by the Committee of the
    effectiveness of the activities of the Commission under subsections
    (b) and (c) of this section.

    agency, shall not, by reason thereof, be considered to be a Federal

    EX. ORD. NO. 13163. INCREASING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH
           DISABILITIES TO BE EMPLOYED IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
      Ex. Ord. No. 13163, July 26, 2000, 65 F.R. 46563, provided:
      By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution
    and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to
    promote an increase in the opportunities for individuals with
    disabilities to be employed at all levels and occupations of the
    Federal Government, and to support the goals articulated in section
    501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791), it is hereby
    ordered as follows:
      Section 1. Increasing the Federal Employment Opportunities for
    Individuals with Disabilities. (a) Recent evidence demonstrates
    that, throughout the United States, qualified persons with
    disabilities have been refused employment despite their
    availability and qualifications, and many qualified persons with
    disabilities are never made aware of available employment
    opportunities. Evidence also suggests that increased efforts at
    outreach, and increased understanding of the reasonable
    accommodations available for persons with disabilities, will permit
    persons with disabilities to compete for employment on a more level
    playing field.
      (b) Based on current hiring patterns and anticipated increases
    from expanded outreach efforts and appropriate accommodations, the
    Federal Government, over the next 5 years, will be able to hire
    100,000 qualified individuals with disabilities. In furtherance of
    such efforts, Federal agencies shall:
        (1) Use available hiring authorities, consistent with statutes,
      regulations, and prior Executive orders and Presidential
      Memoranda;
        (2) Expand their outreach efforts, using both traditional and
      nontraditional methods; and
        (3) Increase their efforts to accommodate individuals with
      disabilities.
      (c) As a model employer, the Federal Government will take the
    lead in educating the public about employment opportunities
    available for individuals with disabilities.
      (d) This order does not require agencies to create new positions
    or to change existing qualification standards for any position.
      Sec. 2. Implementation. Each Federal agency shall prepare a plan
    to increase the opportunities for individuals with disabilities to
    be employed in the agency. Each agency shall submit that plan to
    the Office of Personnel Management within 60 days from the date of
    this order.
      Sec. 3. Authority to Develop Guidance. The Office of Personnel
    Management shall develop guidance on the provisions of this order
    to increase the opportunities for individuals with disabilities
    employed in the Federal Government.
      Sec. 4. Judicial Review. This order is intended only to improve
    the internal management of the executive branch and does not create
    any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law
    or equity by a party against the United States, its agencies, its
    officers, its employees, or any person.

        EX. ORD. NO. 13164. REQUIRING FEDERAL AGENCIES TO ESTABLISH
    PROCEDURES TO FACILITATE THE PROVISION OF REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION
      Ex. Ord. No. 13164, July 26, 2000, 65 F.R. 46565, provided:
      By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution
    and the laws of the United States of America, including the
    Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 701 et seq.), as amended, and
    in order to promote a model Federal workplace that provides
    reasonable accommodation for (1) individuals with disabilities in
    the application process for Federal employment; (2) Federal
    employees with disabilities to perform the essential functions of a
    position; and (3) Federal employees with disabilities to enjoy
    benefits and privileges of employment equal to those enjoyed by
    employees without disabilities, it is hereby ordered as follows:
      Section 1. Establishment of Effective Written Procedures to
    Facilitate the Provision of Reasonable Accommodation. (a) Each
    Federal agency shall establish effective written procedures for
    processing requests for reasonable accommodation by employees and
    applicants with disabilities. The written procedures may allow
    different components of an agency to tailor their procedures as
    necessary to ensure the expeditious processing of requests.
      (b) As set forth in Re-charting the Course: The First Report of
    the Presidential Task Force on Employment of Adults with
    Disabilities (1998), effective written procedures for processing
    requests for reasonable accommodation should include the following:
        (1) Explain that an employee or job applicant may initiate a
      request for reasonable accommodation orally or in writing. If the
      agency requires an applicant or employee to complete a reasonable
      accommodation request form for recordkeeping purposes, the form
      must be provided as an attachment to the agency's written
      procedures;
        (2) Explain how the agency will process a request for
      reasonable accommodation, and from whom the individual will
      receive a final decision;
        (3) Designate a time period during which reasonable
      accommodation requests will be granted or denied, absent
      extenuating circumstances. Time limits for decision making should
      be as short as reasonably possible;
        (4) Explain the responsibility of the employee or applicant to
      provide appropriate medical information related to the functional
      impairment at issue and the requested accommodation where the
      disability and/or need for accommodation is not obvious;
        (5) Explain the agency's right to request relevant supplemental
      medical information if the information submitted does not clearly
      explain the nature of the disability, or the need for the
      reasonable accommodation, or does not otherwise clarify how the
      requested accommodation will assist the employee to perform the
      essential functions of the job or to enjoy the benefits and
      privileges of the workplace;
        (6) Explain the agency's right to have medical information
      reviewed by a medical expert of the agency's choosing at the
      agency's expense;
        (7) Provide that reassignment will be considered as a
      reasonable accommodation if the agency determines that no other
      reasonable accommodation will permit the employee with a
      disability to perform the essential functions of his or her
      current position;
        (8) Provide that reasonable accommodation denials be in writing
      and specify the reasons for denial;
        (9) Ensure that agencies' systems of recordkeeping track the
      processing of requests for reasonable accommodation and maintain
      the confidentiality of medical information received in accordance
      with applicable law and regulations; and
        (10) Encourage the use of informal dispute resolution processes
      to allow individuals with disabilities to obtain prompt
      reconsideration of denials of reasonable accommodation. Agencies
      must also inform individuals with disabilities that they have the
      right to file complaints in the Equal Employment Opportunity
      process and other statutory processes, as appropriate, if their
      requests for reasonable accommodation are denied.
      Sec. 2. Submission of Agency Reasonable Accommodation Procedures
    to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). Within 1
    year from the date of this order, each agency shall submit its
    procedures to the EEOC. Each agency shall also submit to the EEOC
    any modifications to its reasonable accommodation procedures at the
    time that those modifications are adopted.
      Sec. 3. Collective Bargaining Obligations. In adopting their
    reasonable accommodation procedures, agencies must honor their
    obligations to notify their collective bargaining representatives
    and bargain over such procedures to the extent required by law.
      Sec. 4. Implementation. The EEOC shall issue guidance for the
    implementation of this order within 90 days from the date of this
    order.
      Sec. 5. Construction and Judicial Review. (a) Nothing in this
    order limits the rights that individuals with disabilities may have
    under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended.
      (b) This order is intended only to improve the internal
    management of the executive branch and does not create any right or
    benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or equity by
    a party against the United States, its agencies, its officers, its
    employees, or any person.
                                                     William J. Clinton.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 793. Employment under Federal contracts

-STATUTE-
    (a) Amount of contracts or subcontracts; provision for employment
      and advancement of qualified individuals with disabilities;
      regulations
      Any contract in excess of $10,000 entered into by any Federal
    department or agency for the procurement of personal property and
    nonpersonal services (including construction) for the United States
    shall contain a provision requiring that the party contracting with
    the United States shall take affirmative action to employ and
    advance in employment qualified individuals with disabilities. The
    provisions of this section shall apply to any subcontract in excess
    of $10,000 entered into by a prime contractor in carrying out any
    contract for the procurement of personal property and nonpersonal
    services (including construction) for the United States. The
    President shall implement the provisions of this section by
    promulgating regulations within ninety days after September 26,
    1973.
    (b) Administrative enforcement; complaints; investigations;
      departmental action
      If any individual with a disability believes any contractor has
    failed or refused to comply with the provisions of a contract with
    the United States, relating to employment of individuals with
    disabilities, such individual may file a complaint with the
    Department of Labor. The Department shall promptly investigate such
    complaint and shall take such action thereon as the facts and
    circumstances warrant, consistent with the terms of such contract
    and the laws and regulations applicable thereto.
    (c) Waiver by President; national interest special circumstances
      for waiver of particular agreements; waiver by Secretary of Labor
      of affirmative action requirements
      (1) The requirements of this section may be waived, in whole or
    in part, by the President with respect to a particular contract or
    subcontract, in accordance with guidelines set forth in regulations
    which the President shall prescribe, when the President determines
    that special circumstances in the national interest so require and
    states in writing the reasons for such determination.
      (2)(A) The Secretary of Labor may waive the requirements of the
    affirmative action clause required by regulations promulgated under
    subsection (a) of this section with respect to any of a prime
    contractor's or subcontractor's facilities that are found to be in
    all respects separate and distinct from activities of the prime
    contractor or subcontractor related to the performance of the
    contract or subcontract, if the Secretary of Labor also finds that
    such a waiver will not interfere with or impede the effectuation of
    this chapter.
      (B) Such waivers shall be considered only upon the request of the
    contractor or subcontractor. The Secretary of Labor shall
    promulgate regulations that set forth the standards used for
    granting such a waiver.
    (d) Standards used in determining violation of section
      The standards used to determine whether this section has been
    violated in a complaint alleging nonaffirmative action employment
    discrimination under this section shall be the standards applied
    under title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42
    U.S.C. 12111 et seq.) and the provisions of sections 501 through
    504, and 510, of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42
    U.S.C. 12201-12204 and 12210), as such sections relate to
    employment.
    (e) Avoidance of duplicative efforts and inconsistencies
      The Secretary shall develop procedures to ensure that
    administrative complaints filed under this section and under the
    Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 [42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.]
    are dealt with in a manner that avoids duplication of effort and
    prevents imposition of inconsistent or conflicting standards for
    the same requirements under this section and the Americans with
    Disabilities Act of 1990.

    (a) Requirements for Federal departments and agencies
      (1) Accessibility
        (A) Development, procurement, maintenance, or use of electronic
          and information technology
          When developing, procuring, maintaining, or using electronic
        and information technology, each Federal department or agency,
        including the United States Postal Service, shall ensure,
        unless an undue burden would be imposed on the department or
        agency, that the electronic and information technology allows,
        regardless of the type of medium of the technology - 
            (i) individuals with disabilities who are Federal employees
          to have access to and use of information and data that is
          comparable to the access to and use of the information and
          data by Federal employees who are not individuals with
          disabilities; and
            (ii) individuals with disabilities who are members of the
          public seeking information or services from a Federal
          department or agency to have access to and use of information
          and data that is comparable to the access to and use of the
          information and data by such members of the public who are
          not individuals with disabilities.
        (B) Alternative means efforts
          When development, procurement, maintenance, or use of
        electronic and information technology that meets the standards
        published by the Access Board under paragraph (2) would impose
        an undue burden, the Federal department or agency shall provide
        individuals with disabilities covered by paragraph (1) with the
        information and data involved by an alternative means of access
        that allows the individual to use the information and data.
      (2) Electronic and information technology standards
        (A) In general
          Not later than 18 months after August 7, 1998, the
        Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board

        consultation with the Secretary of Education, the Administrator
        of General Services, the Secretary of Commerce, the Chairman of
        the Federal Communications Commission, the Secretary of
        Defense, and the head of any other Federal department or agency
        that the Access Board determines to be appropriate, including
        consultation on relevant research findings, and after
        consultation with the electronic and information technology
        industry and appropriate public or nonprofit agencies or
        organizations, including organizations representing individuals
        with disabilities, shall issue and publish standards setting
        forth - 
            (i) for purposes of this section, a definition of
          electronic and information technology that is consistent with
          the definition of information technology specified in section
          11101(6) of title 40; and
            (ii) the technical and functional performance criteria
          necessary to implement the requirements set forth in
          paragraph (1).
        (B) Review and amendment
          The Access Board shall periodically review and, as
        appropriate, amend the standards required under subparagraph
        (A) to reflect technological advances or changes in electronic
        and information technology.
      (3) Incorporation of standards
        Not later than 6 months after the Access Board publishes the
      standards required under paragraph (2), the Federal Acquisition
      Regulatory Council shall revise the Federal Acquisition
      Regulation and each Federal department or agency shall revise the
      Federal procurement policies and directives under the control of
      the department or agency to incorporate those standards. Not
      later than 6 months after the Access Board revises any standards
      required under paragraph (2), the Council shall revise the
      Federal Acquisition Regulation and each appropriate Federal
      department or agency shall revise the procurement policies and
      directives, as necessary, to incorporate the revisions.
      (4) Acquisition planning
        In the event that a Federal department or agency determines
      that compliance with the standards issued by the Access Board
      under paragraph (2) relating to procurement imposes an undue
      burden, the documentation by the department or agency supporting
      the procurement shall explain why compliance creates an undue
      burden.
      (5) Exemption for national security systems
        This section shall not apply to national security systems, as

        software or the attachment of a specific accessibility-related
        peripheral device at a workstation of a Federal employee who is
        not an individual with a disability.

    described in subsection (a)(1) of this section, compared to the
    access to and use of the technology by individuals described in
    such subsection who are not individuals with disabilities, and
    submit a report containing the evaluation to the Attorney General.

      extent to which the electronic and information technology of the
      Federal Government is accessible to and usable by individuals
      with disabilities described in subsection (a)(1) of this section.
      (2) Biennial reports

    Sec. 794e. Protection and advocacy of individual rights

-STATUTE-
    (a) Purpose and construction
      (1) Purpose
        The purpose of this section is to support a system in each
      State to protect the legal and human rights of individuals with
      disabilities who - 
          (A) need services that are beyond the scope of services
        authorized to be provided by the client assistance program
        under section 732 of this title; and
          (B)(i) are ineligible for protection and advocacy programs
        under subtitle C of the Developmental Disabilities Assistance
        and Bill of Rights Act of 2000 [42 U.S.C. 15041 et seq.]
        because the individuals do not have a developmental disability,
        as defined in section 102 of such Act [42 U.S.C. 15002]; and
          (ii) are ineligible for services under the Protection and
        Advocacy for Mentally Ill Individuals Act of 1986 (!1) (42
        U.S.C. 10801 et seq.) because the individuals are not
        individuals with mental illness, as defined in section 102 of
        such Act (42 U.S.C. 10802).

      (2) Construction
        This section shall not be construed to require the provision of
      protection and advocacy services that can be provided under the
      Assistive Technology Act of 1998 [29 U.S.C. 3001 et seq.].
    (b) Appropriations less than $5,500,000
      For any fiscal year in which the amount appropriated to carry out
    this section is less than $5,500,000, the Commissioner may make
    grants from such amount to eligible systems within States to plan
    for, develop outreach strategies for, and carry out protection and
    advocacy programs authorized under this section for individuals
    with disabilities who meet the requirements of subparagraphs (A)
    and (B) of subsection (a)(1) of this section.
    (c) Appropriations of $5,500,000 or more
      (1) Reservations

          For any fiscal year in which the amount appropriated to carry
        out this section equals or exceeds $5,500,000, the Commissioner
        shall set aside not less than 1.8 percent and not more than 2.2
        percent of the amount to provide training and technical
        assistance to the systems established under this section.
        (B) Grant for the eligible system serving the American Indian
          consortium
          For any fiscal year in which the amount appropriated to carry
        out this section equals or exceeds $10,500,000, the
        Commissioner shall reserve a portion, and use the portion to
        make a grant for the eligible system serving the American
        Indian consortium. The Commission shall make the grant in an
        amount of not less than $50,000 for the fiscal year.
      (2) Allotments
        For any such fiscal year, after the reservations required by
      paragraph (1) have been made, the Commissioner shall make
      allotments from the remainder of such amount in accordance with
      paragraph (3) to eligible systems within States to enable such
      systems to carry out protection and advocacy programs authorized
      under this section for individuals referred to in subsection (b)
      of this section.
      (3) Systems within States
        (A) Population basis
          Except as provided in subparagraph (B), from such remainder
        for each such fiscal year, the Commissioner shall make an
        allotment to the eligible system within a State of an amount
        bearing the same ratio to such remainder as the population of
        the State bears to the population of all States.
        (B) Minimums
          Subject to the availability of appropriations to carry out
        this section, and except as provided in paragraph (4), the
        allotment to any system under subparagraph (A) shall be not
        less than $100,000 or  1/3  of 1 percent of the remainder for
        the fiscal year for which the allotment is made, whichever is
        greater, and the allotment to any system under this section for
        any fiscal year that is less than $100,000 or  1/3  of 1
        percent of such remainder shall be increased to the greater of
        the two amounts.
      (4) Systems within other jurisdictions
        (A) In general
          For the purposes of paragraph (3)(B), Guam, American Samoa,
        the United States Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of the
        Northern Mariana Islands shall not be considered to be States.
        (B) Allotment
          The eligible system within a jurisdiction described in
        subparagraph (A) shall be allotted under paragraph (3)(A) not
        less than $50,000 for the fiscal year for which the allotment
        is made.
      (5) Adjustment for inflation
        For any fiscal year, beginning in fiscal year 1999, in which
      the total amount appropriated to carry out this section exceeds
      the total amount appropriated to carry out this section for the
      preceding fiscal year, the Commissioner shall increase each of
      the minimum grants or allotments under paragraphs (1)(B), (3)(B),
      and (4)(B) by a percentage that shall not exceed the percentage
      increase in the total amount appropriated to carry out this
      section between the preceding fiscal year and the fiscal year
      involved.
    (d) Proportional reduction
      To provide minimum allotments to systems within States (as
    increased under subsection (c)(5) of this section) under subsection
    (c)(3)(B) of this section, or to provide minimum allotments to
    systems within States (as increased under subsection (c)(5) of this
    section) under subsection (c)(4)(B) of this section, the
    Commissioner shall proportionately reduce the allotments of the
    remaining systems within States under subsection (c)(3) of this
    section, with such adjustments as may be necessary to prevent the
    allotment of any such remaining system within a State from being
    reduced to less than the minimum allotment for a system within a
    State (as increased under subsection (c)(5) of this section) under
    subsection (c)(3)(B) of this section, or the minimum allotment for
    a State (as increased under subsection (c)(5) of this section)
    under subsection (c)(4)(B) of this section, as appropriate.
    (e) Reallotment
      Whenever the Commissioner determines that any amount of an
    allotment to a system within a State for any fiscal year described
    in subsection (c)(1) of this section will not be expended by such
    system in carrying out the provisions of this section, the
    Commissioner shall make such amount available for carrying out the
    provisions of this section to one or more of the systems that the
    Commissioner determines will be able to use additional amounts
    during such year for carrying out such provisions. Any amount made
    available to a system for any fiscal year pursuant to the preceding
    sentence shall, for the purposes of this section, be regarded as an
    increase in the allotment of the system (as determined under the
    preceding provisions of this section) for such year.
    (f) Application
      In order to receive assistance under this section, an eligible
    system shall submit an application to the Commissioner, at such
    time, in such form and manner, and containing such information and
    assurances as the Commissioner determines necessary to meet the
    requirements of this section, including assurances that the
    eligible system will - 
        (1) have in effect a system to protect and advocate the rights
      of individuals with disabilities;
        (2) have the same general authorities, including access to
      records and program income, as are set forth in subtitle C of the
      Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of
      2000 [42 U.S.C. 15041 et seq.];
        (3) have the authority to pursue legal, administrative, and
      other appropriate remedies or approaches to ensure the protection
      of, and advocacy for, the rights of such individuals within the
      State or the American Indian consortium who are individuals
      described in subsection (a)(1) of this section;
        (4) provide information on and make referrals to programs and
      services addressing the needs of individuals with disabilities in
      the State or the American Indian consortium;
        (5) develop a statement of objectives and priorities on an
      annual basis, and provide to the public, including individuals
      with disabilities and, as appropriate, the individuals'
      representatives, an opportunity to comment on the objectives and
      priorities established by, and activities of, the system
      including - 
          (A) the objectives and priorities for the activities of the
        system for each year and the rationale for the establishment of

      U.S.C. 12101 et seq.) as the Act relates to employment of
      individuals with disabilities.
    (b) Requirements for payment
      No payment shall be made by the Commissioner under any agreement
    with a grant recipient entered into under subsection (a) of this
    section unless such agreement -

      placed under such agreement shall receive at least the applicable
      minimum wage;
        (2) provides an assurance that any individual with a disability
      placed under this part shall be afforded terms and benefits of

      (1) The Commissioner shall develop standards for the evaluation
    described in subsection (a)(5) of this section and shall review and
    revise the evaluation standards as necessary, subject to paragraph
    (2).
      (2) In revising the standards for evaluation to be used by the
    grant recipients, the Commissioner shall obtain and consider
    recommendations for such standards from State vocational
    rehabilitation agencies, current and former grant recipients,
    professional organizations representing business and industry,
    organizations representing individuals with disabilities,
    individuals served by grant recipients, organizations representing
    community rehabilitation program providers, and labor
    organizations.
    (e) Period of grant; renewal; award on competitive basis; equitable
      distribution
      (1)(A) A grant may be awarded under this section for a period of
    up to 5 years and such grant may be renewed.
      (B) Grants under this section shall be awarded on a competitive
    basis. To be eligible to receive such a grant, a prospective grant
    recipient shall submit an application to the Commissioner at such
    time, in such manner, and containing such information as the
    Commissioner may require.
      (2) The Commissioner shall, to the extent practicable, ensure an
    equitable distribution of payments made under this section among
    the States. To the extent funds are available, the Commissioner
    shall award grants under this section to new projects that will
    serve individuals with disabilities in States, portions of States,
    Indian tribes, or tribal organizations, that are currently unserved
    or underserved by projects.
    (f) Indicators for compliance with evaluation standards; annual
      reports; onsite compliance reviews; analysis included in reports

      (1) The Commissioner shall, as necessary, develop and publish in
    the Federal Register, in final form, indicators of what constitutes
    minimum compliance consistent with the evaluation standards under
    subsection (d)(1) of this section.
      (2) Each grant recipient shall report to the Commissioner at the
    end of each project year the extent to which the grant recipient is
    in compliance with the evaluation standards.
      (3)(A) The Commissioner shall annually conduct onsite compliance
    reviews of at least 15 percent of grant recipients. The
    Commissioner shall select grant recipients for review on a random
    basis.
      (B) The Commissioner shall use the indicators in determining
    compliance with the evaluation standards.
      (C) The Commissioner shall ensure that at least one member of a
    team conducting such a review shall be an individual who - 
        (i) is not an employee of the Federal Government; and
        (ii) has experience or expertise in conducting projects.

      (D) The Commissioner shall ensure that - 
        (i) a representative of the appropriate designated State unit
      shall participate in the review; and
        (ii) no person shall participate in the review of a grant
      recipient if - 
          (I) the grant recipient provides any direct financial benefit
        to the reviewer; or
          (II) participation in the review would give the appearance of
        a conflict of interest.

      (4) In making a determination concerning any subsequent grant
    under this section, the Commissioner shall consider the past
    performance of the applicant, if applicable. The Commissioner shall
    use compliance indicators developed under this subsection that are
    consistent with program evaluation standards developed under
    subsection (d) of this section to assess minimum project
    performance for purposes of making continuation awards in the
    third, fourth, and fifth years.
      (5) Each fiscal year the Commissioner shall include in the annual
    report to Congress required by section 710 of this title an
    analysis of the extent to which grant recipients have complied with
    the evaluation standards. The Commissioner may identify individual
    grant recipients in the analysis. In addition, the Commissioner
    shall report the results of onsite compliance reviews, identifying
    individual grant recipients.
    (g) Technical assistance to entities conducting or planning
      projects
      The Commissioner may provide, directly or by way of grant,
    contract, or cooperative agreement, technical assistance to - 
        (1) entities conducting projects for the purpose of assisting
      such entities in - 
          (A) the improvement of or the development of relationships
        with private industry or labor; or
          (B) the improvement of relationships with State vocational
        rehabilitation agencies; and

    Sec. 796e. Allotments

-STATUTE-
    (a) In general
      (1) States
        (A) Population basis
          Except as provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C), from sums
        appropriated for each fiscal year to carry out this subpart,
        the Commissioner shall make an allotment to each State whose
        State plan has been approved under section 796d-1 of this title
        of an amount bearing the same ratio to such sums as the
        population of the State bears to the population of all States.
        (B) Maintenance of 1992 amounts
          Subject to the availability of appropriations to carry out
        this subpart, the amount of any allotment made under
        subparagraph (A) to a State for a fiscal year shall not be less
        than the amount of an allotment made to the State for fiscal
        year 1992 under part A of this subchapter, as in effect on the
        day before October 29, 1992.
        (C) Minimums
          Subject to the availability of appropriations to carry out
        this subpart, and except as provided in subparagraph (B), the
        allotment to any State under subparagraph (A) shall be not less
        than $275,000 or  1/3  of 1 percent of the sums made available
        for the fiscal year for which the allotment is made, whichever
        is greater, and the allotment of any State under this section
        for any fiscal year that is less than $275,000 or  1/3  of 1
        percent of such sums shall be increased to the greater of the
        two amounts.
      (2) Certain territories
        (A) In general
          For the purposes of paragraph (1)(C), Guam, American Samoa,
        the United States Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of the
        Northern Mariana Islands shall not be considered to be States.
        (B) Allotment
          Each jurisdiction described in subparagraph (A) shall be
        allotted under paragraph (1)(A) not less than  1/8  of 1
        percent of the amounts made available for purposes of this
        subpart for the fiscal year for which the allotment is made.
      (3) Adjustment for inflation
        For any fiscal year, beginning in fiscal year 1999, in which
      the total amount appropriated to carry out this subpart exceeds
      the total amount appropriated to carry out this subpart for the
      preceding fiscal year, the Commissioner shall increase the
      minimum allotment under paragraph (1)(C) by a percentage that
      shall not exceed the percentage increase in the total amount
      appropriated to carry out this subpart between the preceding
      fiscal year and the fiscal year involved.
    (b) Proportional reduction
      To provide allotments to States in accordance with subsection
    (a)(1)(B) of this section, to provide minimum allotments to States
    (as increased under subsection (a)(3) of this section) under
    subsection (a)(1)(C) of this section, or to provide minimum
    allotments to States under subsection (a)(2)(B) of this section,
    the Commissioner shall proportionately reduce the allotments of the
    remaining States under subsection (a)(1)(A) of this section, with
    such adjustments as may be necessary to prevent the allotment of
    any such remaining State from being reduced to less than the amount
    required by subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section.
    (c) Reallotment
      Whenever the Commissioner determines that any amount of an
    allotment to a State for any fiscal year will not be expended by
    such State in carrying out the provisions of this subpart, the
    Commissioner shall make such amount available for carrying out the
    provisions of this subpart to one or more of the States that the
    Commissioner determines will be able to use additional amounts
    during such year for carrying out such provisions. Any amount made
    available to a State for any fiscal year pursuant to the preceding
    sentence shall, for the purposes of this section, be regarded as an
    increase in the allotment of the State (as determined under the
    preceding provisions of this section) for such year.

    Sec. 796f. Program authorization

-STATUTE-
    (a) In general
      From the funds appropriated for fiscal year 1999 and for each
    subsequent fiscal year to carry out this subpart, the Commissioner
    shall allot such sums as may be necessary to States and other
    entities in accordance with subsections (b) through (d) of this
    section.
    (b) Training
      (1) Grants; contracts; other arrangements
        For any fiscal year in which the funds appropriated to carry
      out this subpart exceed the funds appropriated to carry out this
      subpart for fiscal year 1993, the Commissioner shall first
      reserve from such excess, to provide training and technical
      assistance to eligible agencies, centers for independent living,
      and Statewide Independent Living Councils for such fiscal year,
      not less than 1.8 percent, and not more than 2 percent, of the
      funds appropriated to carry out this subpart for the fiscal year
      involved.
      (2) Allocation
        From the funds reserved under paragraph (1), the Commissioner
      shall make grants to, and enter into contracts and other
      arrangements with, entities that have experience in the operation
      of centers for independent living to provide such training and
      technical assistance with respect to planning, developing,
      conducting, administering, and evaluating centers for independent
      living.
      (3) Funding priorities
        The Commissioner shall conduct a survey of Statewide
      Independent Living Councils and centers for independent living
      regarding training and technical assistance needs in order to
      determine funding priorities for such grants, contracts, and
      other arrangements.
      (4) Review
        To be eligible to receive a grant or enter into a contract or
      other arrangement under this subsection, such an entity shall
      submit an application to the Commissioner at such time, in such
      manner, and containing a proposal to provide such training and
      technical assistance, and containing such additional information
      as the Commissioner may require. The Commissioner shall provide
      for peer review of grant applications by panels that include
      persons who are not government employees and who have experience
      in the operation of centers for independent living.
      (5) Prohibition on combined funds
        No funds reserved by the Commissioner under this subsection may
      be combined with funds appropriated under any other Act or part
      of this chapter if the purpose of combining funds is to make a
      single discretionary grant or a single discretionary payment,
      unless such funds appropriated under this part are separately
      identified in such grant or payment and are used for the purposes
      of this part.
    (c) In general
      (1) States
        (A) Population basis
          After the reservation required by subsection (b) of this
        section has been made, and except as provided in subparagraphs
        (B) and (C), from the remainder of the amounts appropriated for
        each such fiscal year to carry out this subpart, the
        Commissioner shall make an allotment to each State whose State
        plan has been approved under section 796d-1 of this title of an
        amount bearing the same ratio to such remainder as the
        population of the State bears to the population of all States.
        (B) Maintenance of 1992 amounts
          Subject to the availability of appropriations to carry out
        this subpart, the amount of any allotment made under

        than the amount of financial assistance received by centers for
        independent living in the State for fiscal year 1992 under part
        B of this subchapter, as in effect on the day before October
        29, 1992.

        fiscal year in which the amounts appropriated to carry out this
        subpart exceed the amounts appropriated for fiscal year 1992 to
        carry out part B of this subchapter, as in effect on the day
        before October 29, 1992 - 
            (i) if such excess is not less than $8,000,000, the

          less than $450,000 or  1/3  of 1 percent of the sums made
          available for the fiscal year for which the allotment is
          made, whichever is greater, and the allotment of any State
          under this section for any fiscal year that is less than
          $450,000 or  1/3  of 1 percent of such sums shall be
          increased to the greater of the 2 amounts;
            (ii) if such excess is not less than $4,000,000 and is less
          than $8,000,000, the allotment to any State under
          subparagraph (A) shall be not less than $400,000 or  1/3  of
          1 percent of the sums made available for the fiscal year for
          which the allotment is made, whichever is greater, and the
          allotment of any State under this section for any fiscal year
          that is less than $400,000 or  1/3  of 1 percent of such sums
          shall be increased to the greater of the 2 amounts; and
            (iii) if such excess is less than $4,000,000, the allotment
          to any State under subparagraph (A) shall approach, as nearly
          as possible, the greater of the 2 amounts described in clause
          (ii).
      (2) Certain territories
        (A) In general
          For the purposes of paragraph (1)(C), Guam, American Samoa,
        the United States Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of the
        Northern Mariana Islands shall not be considered to be States.
        (B) Allotment
          Each jurisdiction described in subparagraph (A) shall be
        allotted under paragraph (1)(A) not less than  1/8  of 1
        percent of the remainder for the fiscal year for which the
        allotment is made.
      (3) Adjustment for inflation
        For any fiscal year, beginning in fiscal year 1999, in which
      the total amount appropriated to carry out this subpart exceeds
      the total amount appropriated to carry out this subpart for the
      preceding fiscal year, the Commissioner shall increase the
      minimum allotment under paragraph (1)(C) by a percentage that
      shall not exceed the percentage increase in the total amount
      appropriated to carry out this subpart between the preceding
      fiscal year and the fiscal year involved.
      (4) Proportional reduction
        To provide allotments to States in accordance with paragraph
      (1)(B), to provide minimum allotments to States (as increased
      under paragraph (3)) under paragraph (1)(C), or to provide
      minimum allotments to States under paragraph (2)(B), the
      Commissioner shall proportionately reduce the allotments of the
      remaining States under paragraph (1)(A), with such adjustments as
      may be necessary to prevent the allotment of any such remaining
      State from being reduced to less than the amount required by
      paragraph (1)(B).
    (d) Reallotment
      Whenever the Commissioner determines that any amount of an
    allotment to a State for any fiscal year will not be expended by
    such State for carrying out the provisions of this subpart, the
    Commissioner shall make such amount available for carrying out the
    provisions of this subpart to one or more of the States that the
    Commissioner determines will be able to use additional amounts
    during such year for carrying out such provisions. Any amount made
    available to a State for any fiscal year pursuant to the preceding
    sentence shall, for the purposes of this section, be regarded as an
    increase in the allotment of the State (as determined under the
    preceding provisions of this section) for such year.

        Unless the director of a designated State unit awards grants
      under section 796f-2 of this title to eligible agencies in a
      State for a fiscal year, the Commissioner shall award grants
      under this section to such eligible agencies for such fiscal year
      from the amount of funds allotted to the State under subsection
      (c) or (d) of section 796f of this title for such year.
      (2) Grants
        The Commissioner shall award such grants, from the amount of

    unless the Commissioner makes a finding that the agency involved
    fails to meet program and fiscal standards and assurances set forth
    in section 796f-4 of this title.
    (d) New centers for independent living
      (1) In general
        If there is no center for independent living serving a region
      of the State or a region is underserved, and the increase in the
      allotment of the State is sufficient to support an additional
      center for independent living in the State, the Commissioner may
      award a grant under this section to the most qualified applicant
      proposing to serve such region, consistent with the provisions in
      the State plan setting forth the design of the State for
      establishing a statewide network of centers for independent
      living.

        proposing to serve geographic areas within each State that are
        currently unserved or underserved by independent living
        programs, consistent with the provisions of the State plan
        submitted under section 796c of this title regarding

        living.
      (3) Current centers
        Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (2), a center for

      fiscal year under this subsection.
    (e) Order of priorities
      The Commissioner shall be guided by the following order of
    priorities in allocating funds among centers for independent living
    within a State, to the extent funds are available:

      independent living, as described in subsection (c) of this
      section, that comply with the standards and assurances set forth
      in section 796f-4 of this title, at the level of funding for the
      previous year.
        (2) The Commissioner shall provide for a cost-of-living
      increase for such existing centers for independent living.
        (3) The Commissioner shall fund new centers for independent
      living, as described in subsection (d) of this section, that
      comply with the standards and assurances set forth in section
      796f-4 of this title.
    (f) Nonresidential agencies
      A center that provides or manages residential housing after
    October 1, 1994, shall not be considered to be an eligible agency
    under this section.
    (g) Review
      (1) In general
        The Commissioner shall periodically review each center
      receiving funds under this section to determine whether such
      center is in compliance with the standards and assurances set
      forth in section 796f-4 of this title. If the Commissioner
      determines that any center receiving funds under this section is
      not in compliance with the standards and assurances set forth in
      section 796f-4 of this title, the Commissioner shall immediately
      notify such center that it is out of compliance.
      (2) Enforcement
        The Commissioner shall terminate all funds under this section
      to such center 90 days after the date of such notification unless
      the center submits a plan to achieve compliance within 90 days of
      such notification and such plan is approved by the Commissioner.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Establishment
      (1) In general
        (A) Initial year
          (i) Determination
            The director of a designated State unit, as provided in
          paragraph (2), or the Commissioner, as provided in paragraph
          (3), shall award grants under this section for an initial
          fiscal year if the Commissioner determines that the amount of
          State funds that were earmarked by a State for a preceding
          fiscal year to support the general operation of centers for
          independent living meeting the requirements of this subpart
          equaled or exceeded the amount of funds allotted to the State
          under subsection (c) or (d) of section 796f of this title for
          such year.
          (ii) Grants
            The director or the Commissioner, as appropriate, shall
          award such grants, from the amount of funds so allotted for
          the initial fiscal year, to eligible agencies in the State
          for the planning, conduct, administration, and evaluation of
          centers for independent living that comply with the standards
          and assurances set forth in section 796f-4 of this title.
          (iii) Regulation
            The Commissioner shall by regulation specify the preceding
          fiscal year with respect to which the Commissioner will make
          the determinations described in clause (i) and subparagraph
          (B), making such adjustments as may be necessary to
          accommodate State funding cycles such as 2-year funding
          cycles or State fiscal years that do not coincide with the
          Federal fiscal year.
        (B) Subsequent years
          For each year subsequent to the initial fiscal year described
        in subparagraph (A), the director of the designated State unit
        shall continue to have the authority to award such grants under
        this section if the Commissioner determines that the State
        continues to earmark the amount of State funds described in
        subparagraph (A)(i). If the State does not continue to earmark
        such an amount for a fiscal year, the State shall be ineligible
        to make grants under this section after a final year following
        such fiscal year, as defined in accordance with regulations
        established by the Commissioner, and for each subsequent fiscal
        year.
      (2) Grants by designated State units

      the grants described in paragraph (1) and carry out this section
      for a fiscal year with respect to a State, the designated State
      agency shall submit an application to the Commissioner at such
      time, and in such manner as the Commissioner may require,
      including information about the amount of State funds described
      in paragraph (1) for the preceding fiscal year. If the
      Commissioner makes a determination described in subparagraph
      (A)(i) or (B), as appropriate, of paragraph (1), the Commissioner
      shall approve the application and designate the director of the
      designated State unit to award the grant and carry out this
      section.
      (3) Grants by Commissioner
        If the designated State agency of a State described in
      paragraph (1) does not submit and obtain approval of an
      application under paragraph (2), the Commissioner shall award the
      grant described in paragraph (1) to eligible agencies in the
      State in accordance with section 796f-1 of this title.
    (b) Eligible agencies
      In any State in which the Commissioner has approved the State
    plan required by section 796c of this title, the director of the
    designated State unit may award a grant under this section to any
    eligible agency that - 
        (1) has the power and authority to carry out the purpose of
      this subpart and perform the functions set forth in section 796f-
      4 of this title within a community and to receive and administer

        (3) submits an application to the director at such time, in
      such manner, and containing such information as the head of the
      designated State unit may require.
    (c) Existing eligible agencies
      In the administration of the provisions of this section, the
    director of the designated State unit shall award grants under this
    section to any eligible agency that has been awarded a grant under
    this subpart by September 30, 1997, unless the director makes a
    finding that the agency involved fails to comply with the standards
    and assurances set forth in section 796f-4 of this title.
    (d) New centers for independent living
      (1) In general
        If there is no center for independent living serving a region
      of the State or the region is unserved or underserved, and the
      increase in the allotment of the State is sufficient to support
      an additional center for independent living in the State, the
      director of the designated State unit may award a grant under
      this section from among eligible agencies, consistent with the
      provisions of the State plan under section 796c of this title
      setting forth the design of the State for establishing a
      statewide network of centers for independent living.
      (2) Selection
        In selecting from among eligible agencies in awarding a grant
      under this subpart for a new center for independent living -

        chairperson of, or other individual designated by, the
        Statewide Independent Living Council acting on behalf of and at
        the direction of the Council, shall jointly appoint a peer
        review committee that shall rank applications in accordance
        with the standards and assurances set forth in section 796f-4
        of this title and criteria jointly established by such director
        and such chairperson or individual;
          (B) the peer review committee shall consider the ability of
        each such applicant to operate a center for independent living,
        and shall recommend an applicant to receive a grant under this
        section, based on - 
            (i) evidence of the need for a center for independent
          living, consistent with the State plan;
            (ii) any past performance of such applicant in providing
          services comparable to independent living services;
            (iii) the plan for complying with, or demonstrated success
          in complying with, the standards and the assurances set forth
          in section 796f-4 of this title;
            (iv) the quality of key personnel of the applicant and the
          involvement of individuals with significant disabilities by
          the applicant;
            (v) the budgets and cost-effectiveness of the applicant;
            (vi) the evaluation plan of the applicant; and
            (vii) the ability of such applicant to carry out the plans;
          and

          (C) the director of the designated State unit shall award the
        grant on the basis of the recommendations of the peer review
        committee if the actions of the committee are consistent with
        Federal and State law.
      (3) Current centers
        Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (2), a center for
      independent living that receives assistance under subpart 2 for a
      fiscal year shall be eligible for a grant for the subsequent
      fiscal year under this subsection.
    (e) Order of priorities
      Unless the director of the designated State unit and the
    chairperson of the Council or other individual designated by the
    Council acting on behalf of and at the direction of the Council
    jointly agree on another order of priority, the director shall be
    guided by the following order of priorities in allocating funds
    among centers for independent living within a State, to the extent
    funds are available:
        (1) The director of the designated State unit shall support
      existing centers for independent living, as described in
      subsection (c) of this section, that comply with the standards
      and assurances set forth in section 796f-4 of this title, at the
      level of funding for the previous year.
        (2) The director of the designated State unit shall provide for
      a cost-of-living increase for such existing centers for
      independent living.
        (3) The director of the designated State unit shall fund new
      centers for independent living, as described in subsection (d) of
      this section, that comply with the standards and assurances set
      forth in section 796f-4 of this title.
    (f) Nonresidential agencies
      A center that provides or manages residential housing after
    October 1, 1994, shall not be considered to be an eligible agency

        The director of the designated State unit shall periodically
      review each center receiving funds under this section to
      determine whether such center is in compliance with the standards
      and assurances set forth in section 796f-4 of this title. If the
      director of the designated State unit determines that any center
      receiving funds under this section is not in compliance with the
