(1) ""Truck"" as a single mode includes shipment that were made by only private truck only for-hire truck, or a combination of private and for-hire truck.
(2) Estimates for pipeline exclude shipments of crude petroleum.",,,,,,,
"NOTE: Value-of-shipment estimates have not been adjusted for price changes. Appendix B tables provide estimated measures of sampling variability. The Introduction and appendixes give information on confidentially protection, sampling error, nonsampling error, sample design, and definitions.

Coverage for the 2002 Commodity Flow Survey (CFS) differs from the previous surveys due to a change from the 1987 Standard Industrial Classification System to the 1997 North American Industry Classification System and other survey improvements. Therefore, data users are urged to use caution when comparing 2002 CFS estimates with estimates from prior years.",,,,,,,
