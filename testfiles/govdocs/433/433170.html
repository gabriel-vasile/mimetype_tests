<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Final:</b></font> The Vietnam School Nutrition Assistance 
Program (VSNAP) received approval for a larger school-feeding program from the 
Prime Minister and the Government of Vietnam in July 2002. The GFEI pilot 
program was expanded to provide individual cartons of UHT milk and a fortified 
biscuit serving to 330,000 beneficiaries per day for the entire 2002/2003 school 
year. The expanded program includes 2074 school locations in six provinces and 
33 districts throughout Vietnam. All children received de-worming medication 
twice a year. The monetization process generated excess proceeds that are being 
used to build high efficiency burners and separate bathrooms for girls.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Because of Vietnam’s declining birthrate and corresponding 
decline in enrollment nationwide of 4% per year, enrollment objectives could not 
be met. <b></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In order to prevent the environmental pollution in schools by 
the garbage created by the milk cartons and biscuits wrappers, LOL has 
collaborated with Tetra Pak to install these burners to dispose of the garbage. 
As of now burners are built in 90% of the schools all over Vietnam.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Midterm:</b></font> During the pilot program, which operated 
from January-May 2002, 65,000 beneficiaries in 301 school locations received 
daily rations of ultra-high-temperature (UHT) milk. LOL and the Vietnamese 
Ministry of Education and Training (MOET) launched a pilot program as they 
waited for Government of Vietnam approval of the larger school-feeding program. 
With government approval, the school feeding program will be expanded to 315,000 
beneficiaries per day in the 2003 school year. Fortified wheat biscuits will be 
provided with the UHT milk. A de-worming program was successfully implemented in 
all GFE schools. The monetization process generated proceeds 2% over budget. The 
LOL GFE school feeding project will continue through May 2003.</p>

		<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Country Overview</p>
		</b></u></font>
		<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
	</dir>
</dir>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Vietnam is the second most populous country in Southeast 
Asia, with a population of almost 79 million of which 40% are concentrated in 
the Mekong River and Red River Deltas. Agriculture, fishing, and forestry 
account for 70 % of employment but only 25% of GDP.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Beginning in 1986, Vietnam launched a series of economic 
reforms. Key elements include decentralization of state economic management; 
autonomy to state-owned enterprises; replacement of administrative measures and 
controls by economic ones, particularly the use of market-oriented monetary 
policies to control inflation; acceptance of market-based exchange rates; and 
implementation of agricultural policies that allow for long term user rights and 
greater freedom in product marketing.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Collective rice production was phased out in the late 1980’s 
and Vietnam soon became a net exporter of rice. Rural families now have much 
greater choice on how to best manage agricultural land, and the result has been 
diversification toward higher value cash crops. In addition to being the world’s 
number two rice exporter, Vietnam is now the world’s third largest exporter of 
coffee. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These economic changes are occurring in the context of a 
&quot;young&quot; country where 70% of the population is 34 years of age or younger. More 
than half the population is under 25 and nearly one-fourth of the population is 
between the ages of 5 and 14. This age distribution places a special pressure on 
health and educational institutions to provide services to a large and still 
growing population.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Despite impressive economic achievements in recent years and 
a sharp reduction in poverty rates, Vietnam remains one of the poorest countries 
in the region with a per capita GDP of about $380 per year. Vietnam ranks 51<sup>st</sup> 
out of 92 developing countries on the Human Poverty Index. More than 90% of the 
population lives on $5 per day or less, and 45% of the people in rural 
communities live below the poverty line. The incidence of poverty varies by 
region, with the highest poverty rate in the northern mountainous region. About 
75% of the people live in rural areas that lack adequate sources of potable 
water. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Child Nutrition Center in Ho Chi Minh City estimates that 
children living in rural areas receive only 70% of their daily calorie 
requirements, and a significant percentage travel long distances to school on 
empty stomachs. Schools participating in the pilot school feeding program in the 
Mekong River Delta region report that anywhere from 20-50% of students do not 
have a breakfast. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA’s) GFE monitor 
reported even higher percentages of children who come to school without 
breakfast. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although 51.5% of the children were underweight in 1985 and 
improvements have been made over the last 10-15 years, the malnutrition rate in 
Vietnam still remains very high, particularly in the rural and mountainous 
regions. Reducing malnutrition continues to be a high priority for the 
Government of Vietnam. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The 1990’s was a decade of progress for primary education in 
Vietnam. Improving access to primary education and the eradication of illiteracy 
were major government goals. By 2001, this effort resulted in a nationwide 
literacy rate of 90% and enrollment and attendance rates at more than 90%. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although reported enrollment of primary school aged children 
is 100%, there is significant room for improvement in secondary and high school 
enrollment. As shown on the chart on the following page, while 48% of all 
students are primary school students (100% of the eligible population), only 27% 
of all students are secondary school students, representing a significant 
drop-off in enrollment after primary school,<a NAME="_Toc10874792"> even 
considering age distribution.</p>
<b></b><font COLOR="#ff00ff"></font><b>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">Total = 21 Million Students</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Despite increasing enrollment and promotion rates during the 
1990’s, dropout and repetition rates remain a concern in Vietnamese primary 
education. Ministry of Education and Training data indicate that the repetition 
and dropout rates for the 1999-2000 school year were 2.8% and 4.7%, 
respectively, or 7.5% in total. Grades one and five are the most problematic 
grades for students. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At that time, the fortified biscuits made with U.S. wheat 
will also be distributed. Indications from the Ministry of Planning and 
Investment are that all processors supplying milk and biscuits to the program 
will receive a value added tax (VAT) rebate. The LOL-VINAMILK barter contract 
has a clause that states that in the event of any VAT rebate, all savings will 
be passed back to the school feeding program in the form of additional 
quantities of milk units, estimated to be another 1.65 million units more than 
the contract-stipulated total. Similar clauses will be included in any future 
milk and biscuit contracts.</p>

<font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><u><b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Project Overview </p>
</b></u></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most children in rural Vietnam travel long distances to get 
to school, and many arrive without having eaten breakfast. A healthy snack 
provided by the VSNAP would give these children micronutrients and calories that 
would reduce their hunger and should lead to improved performance and a better 
quality educational experience. A positive educational experience would 
encourage more students to go on to secondary and high school, where enrollment 
rates are currently 60% and lower – significantly less than the 
government-reported 100-% rates for enrollment at the primary school level. LOL 
decided to try to have some impact through the GFE project on the dropout and 
repetition rates seen in grades one and two. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the LOL-USDA agreement, LOL proposed to carry out a large 
distribution program. This would include delivering milk and nutritious biscuits 
as a daily snack to 400,000 primary school children in several targeted regions 
of the country to be chosen by a committee of government and private sector 
representatives. However, the Government of Vietnam does not allow international 
donor projects of more than $500,000 to be implemented without concurrence of 
all government ministries. This approval process can take a long time. 
Therefore, LOL and MOET agreed to carry out a small pilot project feeding 65,000 
primary school students in the Mekong River Delta region. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Delta area was chosen for the pilot because of the high 
dropout rate the region experienced during the October-December rainy season, 
when flooding was unusually heavy. The Delta region’s proximity by automobile to 
Ho Chi Minh City (three to five hours) would allow both LOL and the processors 
to monitor logistics and manage other reporting issues carefully in the pilot 
phase.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Both LOL and the Government of Vietnam wanted to implement 
the VSNAP pilot project as soon as possible in order to reach hungry children 
and also to reduce the time for the approval of the project expansion to the 
original GFE project size. Because the commodities, and the revenues from their 
sale, would not arrive until the end of December 2001, LOL decided to advance 
its own funds so that the project could begin in September. The staff 
immediately began the implementation planning and startup activities. In early 
January 2002, milk distribution began to 65,000 beneficiaries daily in 301 
school locations in the Mekong River Delta region.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The VSNAP daily nutritious snack consists of a 200-milliliter 
carton of fortified milk and a nutritious wheat biscuit. The two products 
combined provide the children with 300 calories and about 50% of the recommended 
daily allowance (RDA) of needed vitamins and minerals. The 300 calories 
represent about 60% of the estimated calorie deficit facing children in rural 
Vietnam. The snack, combined with planned de-worming twice a year, is expected 
to have significant impact on the nutritional status of children participating 
in the program.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An additional component of LOL’s GFE project is to strengthen 
the production capacity of dairy and food producers in the private sector. 
Technical assistance through LOL and other technical specialists will be 
targeted at those producers with the goal of expanding their capacity and 
improving the quality of their products. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Goals and objectives:</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">
</font></b>The goals of the VSNAP are to increase enrollment and attendance by 
20% and increase overall performance in primary schools. LOL staff also expected 
to improve dairy and food processing operations in the country.</p>

<dir>
	<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">MOET’s Primary Education Department is LOL’s lead partner 
	in the VSNAP. LOL works with a small management team in Hanoi, as well as 
	with government representatives at the province and district levels. This 
	partnership provided LOL direct access to primary schools and allowed for a 
	quick startup of milk delivery to students. </p>
	<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Nutrition Institute (Ministry of Health) will 
	continue to work with the VSNAP to develop the nutrition education component 
	of the program to be implemented at the start of the 2002/03 school year. 
	District and local level offices assist in the de-worming program.</p>
	<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under a contract with LOL, the Vietnam Red Cross, which 
	has a nationwide network and local connections, monitors school level 
	participation on a random, spot-check basis. It ensures that schools follow 
	program guidelines and alerts LOL if other problems or issues are identified 
	during school visits. The Vietnam Red Cross was particularly valuable in 
	alerting LOL to the carton disposal and environmental issues.</p>
	<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tetra Pak and its Ho Chi Minh City office provided 
	startup support in the form of staff time and office space during 
	October–December 2001. Tetra Pak is also offering packaging discounts to 
	suppliers and has designated staff from its Singapore office to work with 
	LOL to come up with solutions for dealing with empty cartons in a country

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Final</font></b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">:</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">
</font>The Government of Vietnam has prioritized population and family planning 
in recent years. In 1999, women in the childbearing age group had an average of 
2.3 children compared with 3.8 ten years ago. Additionally, the child mortality 
rate in 2000 and 2001 was 2.7 and 3% respectively. Both of these factors have 
contributed to the declining numbers of students enrolled in school. While the 
numbers are down, the percentage of school aged children enrolled in and 
attending school still remains high. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another factor making trend measurement hard is that the 
Government of Vietnam had initiated a program, starting in 1994, to get children 
into school and finish basic education. Enrollment peaked at 12.2 million in 
1997 and included children aged 6-18 years, or older because the Government 
wanted to ensure primary education for all. Enrollment from 1994 – 1997 
increased from 8.9 to 12.2 million (37%) and included many older students. After 
1997, enrollment started to decline because the age range being considered as 
&quot;school age&quot; reduced from earlier period and included mostly children in the 
6-14 year old range. Current school year statistics are counting only 6-12 
year-old students, with the older students out of the system.</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While the birthrate for 2000 was up as mentioned previously, 
the child mortality rate<b> </b>remained about the same, offsetting the 
increase, which means that school age population has not been increasing.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p>Attachment 1 includes statistics for the Mekong River Delta region, the area 
that has participated in VSNAP the longest. The numbers enrolled follow general 
population trends, but there has been an impact on the retention/drop out rate 
as well as performance by students. LOL plans to continue to track and follow 
performance trends in schools participating in the program as a good area to 
measure impact.</p>
<p>Mr Hoa, the Leader of the Department of Education and Training (DOET ), of 
Thap Muoi District, stated that &quot;the USDA/ GFEI program in Vietnam gave 
Vietnamese children who live in the poorest areas many good things. Three things 
we can recognize are: First: Improvement in their health and performance, 
physically more energetic and eager to learn.<font COLOR="#ff0000"> </font>
Second: Drop out rate is decreased. Third: The relationship between PTA and 
schools has improved. I would like to say thank you so much to U.S. Department 
of Agriculture for sponsoring this program and LOL for implementing this program 
in Vietnam.&quot; </p>

</font>
<p>Midterm</b>: LOL originally planned to feed more children sooner. However, 
the pilot program worked well given the bureaucratic obstacles, distribution and 
infrastructure issues, product development and packaging cycles, and timing of 
commodity arrival. Over the course of the five month pilot, the VSNAP staff 
learned the following lessons that will be incorporated into the larger program:</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<dir>
	<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sweetened, fortified milk works best.<b> </b>Milk sold 
	commercially in Vietnam is sweetened and/or flavored. For the first three 
	months of the program, a commercially sold sweetened formula was used in the 
	VSNAP. After the third month, LOL asked VINAMILK to produce an unsweetened 
	run (10,000 units) to test with the children. Although the tests were not 
	scientific, the unsweetened milk was not popular. Popular taste preferences, 
	coupled with the approximately 500-calorie daily gap for children living in 
	rural communities, drove the decision to switch back to sweetened milk. The 
	extra calories are not &quot;empty&quot; in rural Vietnam. The milk formula will also 
	be adjusted to include additional vitamin A and D. </p>
	<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fortified biscuit/snack products do not exist in the 
	commercial market. The LOL team has been working with four different biscuit 
	manufacturers to develop a tasty, 150-calorie/30 gram wheat biscuit 
	fortified with 50% of the recommended daily allowance (RDA) of vitamins and 
	minerals. Because there are no fortified biscuit or snack products available 
	in the market, processors must go through a cumbersome approval process<b>
	</b>with the Vietnam Food and Drug Administration. </p>
	<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Educating parents about micronutrients and the benefits 
	of fortified products will be a key part of sustainability. VSNAP staff has 
	learned from the pilot project that there is a need to include parents in 
	the nutrition training process. Many parents do not fully appreciate the 
	nutritional value of milk and often have concerns that too much milk will 
	cause a child to be &quot;obese.&quot; The VSNAP will include parents in future 
	nutrition education efforts so that they are fully aware of the importance 
	of the milk and fortified biscuits in improving the physical and mental 
	health of their children.</p>
	<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Change in packaging materials will increase the number of 
	children that can be fed. The 2002/03 VSNAP will use a combination of brick 
	or box-shaped (30%) and fino or pouch (70%) packaging. LOL has decided to 
	switch because of a 2-cent per serving savings. The capacity of the existing 
	Tetra Fino lines currently operating in Vietnam is about 70% of target 
	numbers. Tetra Pak has offered to further discount the Tetra Brik packaging 
	(discount increased from 5% to 10%) for the remaining volume as a way to 
	show support for the program. </p>
	<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Empty carton and biscuit wrappers create a garbage 
	problem. VSNAP needs to find a better way to dispose of empty milk cartons 
	because rural communities do not have a formal system of garbage collection. 
	The empty cartons (and future biscuit wrappers) are more garbage than some 
	communities have ever seen, especially at small branch school locations. The 
	current practice is to burn the cartons in shallow holes very near the 
	school. LOL will have to develop a better trash disposal system and ensure 
	that appropriate education and training is conducted to ensure schools 
	dispose of their garbage in the most logical, environmentally safe way.</p>
	<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The most efficient approach to deliver products to the 
	schools is for the suppliers to deliver to the branches and let the teachers 
	teach. The pilot program fed 65,000 beneficiaries at 96 schools and 301 
	locations. Providing product directly to branch schools will have to be kept 
	in mind for the expanded program. As new schools are added, it will require 
	training more school staff.</p>
	<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Identifying key people responsible for recordkeeping is 
	essential. LOL understood the importance of accurate recordkeeping and did a 
	thorough job in training school staff to assume responsibility for tracking 
	inventory and consumption. However, the people trained did not do the 
	recording and did not teach others how to do accurately. The need to 
	complete forms accurately and on a regular basis has been a learning 
	experience for school staff.</p>
	<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Three strikes and you’re out&quot; needs to be the rule. Some 
	schools do not take the program guidelines seriously and do not maintain 
	accurate records or adequately store the milk. This lack of responsible 
	cooperation cannot be accepted, especially as the program expands. The team 
	is working to develop a warning system that will allow a school two chances 
	to improve its reporting, storage, and/or garbage disposal systems. If the 
	school does not improve or at least show a serious effort, then it will be 
	removed from the program. </p>

	de-worming as part of the VSNAP. A de-worming program was implemented in all

	as the program continues.</p>
	<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By involving multiple processors to ensure competitive

	sector processing and distribution of processed products to schools in rural 
	communities. Although the VSNAP will use multiple processors, the processors 
	are required to use VSNAP-only designated packaging design. Packaging will

joy. Despite their noise, the children remain seated. Tran Van Lang, the man 
responsible for receiving and distributing milk at this school, explains, &quot;This 
first set of drum beats is the signal that it is milk time.&quot; Then the drum beats 
10 minutes, telling the teachers it is time to collect milk for their students. 
This is why the students wait patiently at their desks. After the milk is 
consumed, the drum beats again indicating that the children can go outside and

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A teacher in a primary school in Dong Thap said: &quot;I’m very 
grateful to the school milk program because, thanks to this program, I rarely 
have to encourage children to go to school. The children become so milk-addicted 
that the attendance is normally 100%. During school time, they just look forward 
to milk time. Sometimes I forget about milk time and they remind me right away. 
They rush out with eager faces whenever I bring the milk to the classroom.&quot; 
Another teacher reported, &quot;There are 38 pupils in my class. Most of them love to 
drink milk. Lately, the only time they are absent from school is when they are 
sick. When they came back, they often comment that being sick meant that they 
missed having milk that day. School milk really helps us a lot in attracting 
pupils to schools.&quot; </p>

afraid he will be obese.&quot; The principal explained that gaining weight is a good 
sign, and their son will not become obese from drinking milk. However, the 
parents did not believe the school principal and took their son to a local 
clinic for examination. Only after the doctor concluded that the boy’s health

<p>NOTES/CONCLUSIONS:</p>
<dir>
	<dir>
		<p>MOET Plan is based on estimate of primary school age population.</p>
		<p>Consistent stats from VN Govt, Census, any source are very hard to 
		come by. (i.e. General Statistics Dept reports primary school age 
		population 9.3 which would mean 100% enrollment)</p>
		<p>VN Govt had initiated a program in 1994 to get children into school 
		and finish basic, enrollment peaked at 12.2 million in 1997 and included 
		children aged 6-18 years, older, because govt wanted to be sure 
		everybody received not less than primary education. Increase in 
		enrollment from 1994 – 1997 was from 8.9 to 12.2 (37%) and included many 
		older students. </p>
		<p>After 1997 enrollment started to decline because the age range being 
		considered as &quot;school age&quot; reduced from the earlier period and included 
		mostly children in 6-14 year age range.</p>
		<p>Current school year counting only 6-12 year-old students, with the 
		older students out of the system.</p>
		<p>The birthrate for 2000 was up 1.4%, but child mortality (ages 1-5 yr) 
		was about 1%, offsetting the increase, meaning that school age 
		population not increasing.</p>
		<p>Given the above and the difficulty of getting accurate and consistent 
		statistics, it is very difficult to compare enrollment trends from year 
		to year.</p>
