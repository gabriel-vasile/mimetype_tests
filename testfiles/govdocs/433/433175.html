<strong> Q.  In terms of mass, how much carbon does 1 part per million by volume of

<strong> A.</strong>  Using 5.137 x 10<sup><font size=-1>18</sup></font> kg as the mass of the atmosphere

<p>


<strong> Q.  What percentage of the CO<sub><font size=-1>2</sub></font> in the atmosphere has been
produced by human beings through the burning of fossil
fuels?</strong>
<p>

<strong> A. </strong> Anthropogenic CO<sub><font size=-1>2</sub></font> comes from fossil
fuel combustion, changes in land use (e.g., forest clearing), and cement manufacture.
<a href="/trends/landuse/houghton/houghton.html">Houghton and Hackler</a>
have estimated land-use changes from 1850-2000, so it is convenient to use 1850 as
our starting point for the following discussion. Atmospheric CO<sub><font size=-1>2</sub></font>
concentrations had not changed appreciably over the preceding 850 years
(<a href="http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/015.htm"</a>IPCC; The Scientific Basis</a>) so
it may be safely assumed that they would not have changed appreciably in the 150 years
from 1850 to 2000 in the absence of human intervention.
<p>

In the following calculations, we will express atmospheric concentrations of
CO<sub><font size="-1">2</sub></font> in units of parts per million by volume (ppmv). Each ppmv
represents 2.13 X10<sup><font size="-1">15</sup></font> grams, or 2.13 petagrams of carbon (PgC) in the atmosphere. According to
<a href="/trends/landuse/houghton/houghton.html">Houghton and Hackler</a>,
land-use changes from 1850-2000 resulted in a net transfer of 154 PgC to the atmosphere.
During that same period, 282 PgC were released by
<a href="/trends/emis/em_cont.htm">combustion of fossil fuels</a>, and 5.5 additional PgC were released
to the atmosphere from cement manufacture. This adds up to 154 + 282 + 5.5 = 441.5 PgC,
of which 282/444.1 = 64% is due to fossil-fuel combustion.
<p>

Atmospheric CO<sub><font size=-1>2</sub></font> concentrations rose from
<a href="/trends/co2/siple-gr.htm">288 ppmv in 1850</a> to <a href="/ftp/trends/co2/maunaloa.co2">369.5 ppmv
in 2000</a>, for an increase of 81.5 ppmv, or 174 PgC. In other words, about
40% (174/441.5) of the additional carbon has remained in the atmosphere, while the
remaining 60% has been transferred to the oceans and terrestrial biosphere.
<p>

The 369.5 ppmv of carbon in the atmosphere, in the form of CO<sub><font size=-1>2</sub></font>,
translates into 787 PgC, of which 174 PgC has been added since 1850. From the second
paragraph above, we see that 64% of that 174 PgC, or 111 PgC, can be attributed to
fossil-fuel combustion. This represents about 14% (111/787) of the carbon in the atmosphere
in the form of CO<sub><font size=-1>2</sub></font>.

<strong> Q. How much carbon dioxide is produced from the combustion of 1000 cubic feet
of natural gas? </strong></a>
<p>

<strong> A. </strong> If we start with 1000 cubic feet of natural gas (and assuming
it is pure methane or CH<sub><font size=-1>4</sub></font>) at STP (standard temperature and pressure,
i.e., temperature of 273&#176K = 0&#176C = 32&#176F and pressure of 1 atm = 14.7
psia = 760 torr), and burn it completely, here's what we come up with:
<p>

1 cubic foot (cf) = 0.0283165 cubic meters (m<sup><font size=-1>3</sup></font>)<br>
and 1 m<sup><font size=-1>3</sup></font> = 1000 liters (L)<br>
so 1 cf = 28.31685 L<br>
and 1000 cf = 28316.85 L
<p>

Since 1 mole of a gas occupies 22.4 L at STP, 28316.85 L of CH<sub><font size=-1>4</sub></font> contains
28316.85/22.4 = 1264.145 moles of CH<sub><font size=-1>4</sub></font> (each mole of CH<sub><font size=-1>4</sub></font> = approx. 16 g)
<p>
If we burn CH<sub><font size=-1>4</sub></font> completely, it follows this equation:<br>
CH<sub><font size=-1>4</sub></font> + 2O<sub><font size=-1>2</sub></font> => CO<sub><font size=-1>2</sub></font> + 2H<sub><font size=-1>2</sub></font>0
<p>

That is, for each mole of methane we get one mole of carbon dioxide.
<p>

One mole of CO<sub><font size=-1>2</sub></font> has a mass of approx. 44 g,
so 1264.145 moles of CO<sub><font size=-1>2</sub></font> has a mass of approx. 1264.145 x 44 or 55622.38 g
<p>

A pound is about equivalent to 454 g,
so 55622.38 g is about equivalent to 55622.38/454 or 122 lb
<p>

That is, the complete combustion of 1000 cubic feet at STP of natural gas
results in the production of about 122 lb of carbon dioxide.
<p>

Of course, the mass of the methane in 1000 cubic feet will vary if the
temperature and pressure are NOT as assumed above, and this will affect the
mass of CO<sub><font size=-1>2</sub></font> produced. According to the Ideal Gas Law:
<p>

<pre>
PV = nRT

where	P = pressure
	V = volume
	n = moles of gas
	T = temperature
	R = constant (0.08206 L atm/mole K or 62.36 L torr/mole K)

at STP, 1000 cf contains

n = PV/RT moles of methane
  = (1 atm)(28316.85 L)/(0.08206 L atm/mole K)(273&#176K)
  = 1264 moles CH<sub><font size=-1>4</sub></font> (the value given in the example above)
</pre>
<p>

In the energy industry, however, 1 standard cubic foot (scf) of natural gas
is defined at 60&#176F (= 15.6&#176C = 288.6&#176K) and 14.7 psia, rather than at STP
(<a href="http://www.littleredbook.com/INDEX.HTML" target="resource window">Handbook of Formulae,
Equations and Conversion Factors for the Energy Professional</a>, JOB
Publications, Tallahassee, FL;). Solving again at this higher (relative
to STP) temperature, we get:
<p>

<pre>
n = (1 atm)(28316.85 L)/(0.08206 L atm/mole K)(288.6&#176K)
  = 1196 moles CH<sub><font size=-1>4</sub></font>
</pre>
<p>

That is, at the higher temperature, a given volume of gas will contain fewer
moles, and less mass. Going again through the calculation for CO<sub><font size=-1>2</sub></font> emitted,
but using the value of 1196 moles of CH<sub><font size=-1>4</sub></font>, results in an answer of
approximately 115 lb of carbon dioxide.

<strong> Q.  Why do some estimates of CO<sub><font size=-1>2</sub></font> emissions seem to be about
3 1/2 times as large as others? </strong></a><p>

<strong> A. </strong>  When looking at CO<sub><font size=-1>2</sub></font> emissions estimates, it is
important to look at the units in which they are expressed.  The numbers are sometimes
expressed as mass of CO<sub><font size=-1>2</sub></font> but are listed in all of our estimates only in
terms of the mass of the C (carbon).  Because C cycles through the atmosphere, oceans,
plants, fuels, etc. and changes the ways in which it is combined with other elements,
it is often easier to keep track only of the flows of carbon. Emissions expressed in
units of C can be easily converted to emissions in CO<sub><font size=-1>2</sub></font> units by adjusting
for the mass of the attached oxygen atoms, that is by multiplying by the ratios
of the molecular weights,  44/12, or 3.67.

<strong> Q.  Why is the sum of all national and regional CO<sub><font size=-1>2</sub></font> emission
estimates less than the global totals? </strong></a><p>

<strong> A. </strong>  The difference between the sum of the individual countries
(or regions) and the global estimates is generally less than 5%.  There are four
primary reasons for this.
<p>
<ol>
<li>global totals include emissions from bunker fuels whereas these are not
included in national (or regional) totals.  Bunker fuels are fuels used by ships
and aircraft in international transportation,<p>

<li>global totals include estimates for the oxidation of non-fuel hydrocarbon products
(e.g., asphalt, lubricants, petroleum waxes, etc.) whereas national totals do not,<p>

<li>national totals include annual changes in fuel stocks whereas the global total does
not, and<p>

<li>due to statistical differences in the international statistics, the sum of exports
from all exporters is not identical to the sum of all imports by all importers.

<strong> Q.  Why do some smaller nations have larger per capita emission estimates
than industrialized nations like the US? </strong></a>
<p>

<strong> A. </strong>  Often it is difficult to attribute emissions to a source. Many
small island nations have military bases that are used for re-fueling or have large
tourist industries.  Who do you assign the emissions to; the US whose military planes
are re-fueling on the Wake Island with aviation and jet fuel or the Wake Island? The
accounting  practices used within the UN Energy Statistics Database assign this fuel
consumption to the Wake Island thus elevating the Wake Island's per capita estimate.
The same is true for tourist nations like Aruba who are assigned the fuels used in
the commercial planes carrying tourists back to their native countries.  Although this
distorts the per capita emission estimates it makes it easier from an accounting
standpoint than trying to trace each plane or ship to its final destination.  One
should be cautious in using only the per capita CO<sub><font size=-1>2</sub></font>
emission estimates.<font size=-1>[TAB]</font>

<strong> Q.  What is the greenhouse effect? Is it the same as the ozone hole
issue?</strong></a>
<p>

<strong> A. </strong>  No, they are two different (but related) issues.The greenhouse
effect issue concerns the warming of the lower part of the atmosphere, the troposphere
(the layer in which temperature drops with height; it is about 10-15 kilometers thick,
varying with latitude and season), by increasing concentrations of the so-called
greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, ozone, and others) in the
troposphere. This warming occurs because the greenhouse gases, while they are transparent
to incoming solar radiation,  absorb infrared (heat) radiation from the Earth that
would otherwise escape from the atmosphere into space; the greenhouse gases then
re-radiate some of this heat back towards the surface of the Earth.<p>

The ozone hole issue concerns the loss of ozone in the upper part of the atmosphere,
the stratosphere, resulting from increasing concentrations of certain halogenated
hydrocarbons (such as chlorinated fluorocarbons, known as CFCs). Through a series
of chemical reactions in the stratosphere, the halogenated hydrocarbons destroy ozone
in the stratosphere. This is of concern because the ozone blocks incoming ultraviolet
radiation from the Sun, and portions of the ultraviolet radiation spectrum have been
found to have adverse biological effects.<p>

The greenhouse effect and ozone hole issues are, however, related. For example, CFCs
are involved in both issues: CFCs, in addition to destroying stratosphere ozone, are
also greenhouse gases. It has traditionally been thought there is not much mixing
of the troposphere and stratosphere. But there is recent evidence of transport of
stratospheric ozone into the troposphere (see "Ozone-rich transients in the upper
equatorial Atlantic troposphere," by Suhre et al., <i> Nature </i>, Vol. 388,
14 August 1997, pages 661-663, and the related discussion paper, "Ozone clouds
over the Atlantic," by Crutzen and Lawrence, on pages 625-626 in the same issue
of <i> Nature </i>). So ozone depletion in the stratosphere could result in reduced
concentrations of this greenhouse gas in the troposphere. Conversely, global
climate change could also affect ozone depletion through changes in stratospheric
temperature and water vapor (see "The effect of climate change on ozone depletion
through changes in stratospheric water vapour," by Kirk-Davidoff et al., <i>Nature</i>,
Vol. 402, 25 November 1999, pages 399-401). <font size=-1>[RMC]</font>

<strong> Q. Should we be concerned with human breathing as a source of
CO<sub><font size=-1>2</sub></font>? </strong></a>
<p>

<strong> A. </strong> No. While people do exhale carbon dioxide (the rate is approximately
1 kg per day, and it depends strongly on the person's activity level), this carbon dioxide
includes carbon that was originally taken out of the carbon  dioxide in the air by
plants through photosynthesis - whether you eat the plants  directly or animals that eat
the plants. Thus, there is a closed loop, with no net  addition to the atmosphere. Of course,
the agriculture, food processing, and marketing industries use energy (in many cases
based on the combustion of fossil fuels), but their emissions of carbon dioxide are
captured in our estimates as<a href="/ndps/ndp030.html"> emissions</a> from solid, liquid,
or gaseous fuels.
<font size=-1>[RMC]</font>

<p>

<strong> Q. How does the oxygen cycle relate to the greenhouse effect and global warming?
</strong></a>
<p>

<strong> A. </strong>With recent developments it is now feasible to measure variations in
the oxygen content of the atmosphere at the parts per million (ppm) level.  Regular
measurements of changes in atmospheric oxygen (O<sub><font size=-1>2</sub></font>) are currently being made
at a number of locations around the world using two independent techniques, one based
on interferometry and one based on stable isotope mass spectroscopy.  Oxygen measurements
can inform us about fundamental aspects of the global carbon cycle.  Oxygen is generated
by green plants in photosynthesis and converted to carbon dioxide (CO<sub><font size=-1>2</sub></font>) in
animal and human respiration. Carbon dioxide is the greenhouse gas of most concern due
to its abundance in the atmosphere (~ 360 ppm) and anthropogenic sources.  Variations
in atmospheric O<sub><font size=-1>2</sub></font> are controlled largely by fluxes of carbon
(e.g., photosynthesis and respiration CO<sub><font size=-1>2</sub></font> + H<sub><font size=-1>2</sub></font>O <=>
CH<sub><font size=-1>2</sub></font>O + O<sub><font size=-1>2</sub></font>).

<strong> Q. Is it possible to reduce CO<sub><font size=-1>2</sub></font> emissions without cutting back on
the burning of fossil fuels? In other words, can higher efficiency or better technology
reduce the impact of the consumption of fossil fuels? </strong></a>
<p>

<strong> A. </strong>Fossil fuels are basically carbon and hydrogen.  When fossil fuels
are burned the carbon is oxidized to produce carbon dioxide and the hydrogen is oxidized
to water. During these reactions heat is released, which is why we burn the fossil fuels
in the first place.  There are all kinds of issues involved in the efficiency with which
the heat is used to provide services for mankind, but basically, if you burn fossil
fuels - you get carbon dioxide (and water, but we don't care about the water).  People
have debated ways to collect the carbon dioxide, and what you would do with it if you
did collect it, but to collect it requires a significant portion of the energy (heat)
that you got by burning the fossil fuel in the first place.  That is, it is very expensive
to collect the carbon dioxide and it is still not very clear what you would do with it -
lots of it.  I think that many people envision that carbon dioxide is like sulfur dioxide
in that it is a pollutant the comes along with burning coal and that if we had better
technology or more care, we could eliminate it.  This is simply not true, if you burn coal,
you get carbon dioxide as a necessary and unavoidable product.  Like I say, there is a
fair amount of literature now on ways to collect and dispose of carbon dioxide, but you
really can't burn fossil fuels without getting it.

<strong> Q. How much CO<SUB><FONT SIZE=-1>2</SUB></FONT> is emitted as a result of my using specific
electrical appliances? </strong></a>
<p>

<strong> A. </strong> For this answer, we refer you to an excellent article,
"Your Contribution to Global Warming," by George Barnwell, which appeared on
p. 53 of the February-March 1990 issue of <I>National Wildlife</I>, the magazine
of the National Wildlife Federation. The article, assuming that your electricity
comes from coal, calculates CO<SUB><FONT SIZE=-1>2</SUB></FONT> emissions corresponding to the use of
various electrical appliances. For example, one hour's use of a color television
produces 0.64 pounds (lb) of CO<SUB><FONT SIZE=-1>2</SUB></FONT>, and each use of a toaster produces
0.12 lbCO<SUB><FONT SIZE=-1>2</SUB></FONT>, whereas a day's use of a waterbed heater produces 24 lb
CO<SUB><FONT SIZE=-1>2</SUB></FONT>.
<P>
In general, the coefficient is about 2.3 lb CO<SUB><FONT SIZE=-1>2</SUB></FONT> per kilowatt-hour (kWh)
of electricity. You can calculate the kWh of electricity by multiplying the
number of watts (W) the appliance uses times the number of hours (h) it is
used, then dividing by 1000. For example a 60-W light bulb operated for 24 h uses
 <P>
<CENTER>(60 W) x (24 h) / (1000) = 1.44 kWh.</CENTER>
<P>
This use of electricity would produce an emission of<P>
<center>
(1.44 kWh) x (2.3 lb CO<sub><font size=-1>2</sub></font> per kWh) = 3.3 lb CO<SUB><FONT SIZE=-1>2</SUB></FONT></center>
<p>if the electricity is derived from the combustion of coal.

<strong>Q.  What are the conditions happening in certain countries that
could upset or disturb the oxygen cycle?</strong>
<p>

<strong>A.</strong>  Probably the leading investigator of the global oxygen cycle
is Dr. Ralph Keeling of Scripps Institution of Oceanography. The web link
(http://earth.agu.org/revgeophys/keelin01/keelin01.html) provides information on
his work. Given that oxygen is produced by vegetation, it might be argued that
mankind has the greatest influence on the oxygen cycle by means of alterations
in the world's vegetation (e.g., deforestation, effects of increasing
atmospheric CO<sub><font size=-1>2</sub></font> on photosynthesis).

<strong>Q.  Why do certain compounds, such as carbon dioxide, absorb and emit
infrared energy?</strong>
<p>

<strong>A.</strong>  Molecules can absorb and emit three kinds of energy: energy
from the excitation of electrons, energy from rotational motion, and energy from
vibrational motion. The first kind of energy is also exhibited by atoms, but the
second and third are restricted to molecules. A molecule can rotate about its
center of gravity (there are three mutually perpendicular axes through the center
of gravity). Vibrational energy is gained and lost as the bonds between atoms,
which may be thought of as springs, expand and contract and bend. The three kinds
of energy are associated with different portions of the spectrum: electronic energy
is typically in the visible and ultraviolet portions of the spectrum (for example,
wavelength of 1 micrometer, vibrational energy in the near infrared and infrared (for
example, wavelength of 3 micrometers), and rotational energy in the far infrared to
microwave (for example, wavelength of 100 micrometers). The specific wavelength of
absorption and emission depends on the type of bond and the type of group of atoms
within a molecule. Thus, the stretching of the C-H bond in the
CH<sub><font size=-1>2</sub></font> and CH<sub><font size=-1>3</sub></font> groups
involves infrared energy with a wavelength of
3.3-3.4 micrometers. What makes certain gases, such as carbon dioxide, act as
"greenhouse" gases is that they happen to have vibrational modes that absorb energy
in the infrared wavelengths at which the earth radiates energy to space. In fact, the
measured "peaks" of infrared absorbance are often broadened because of the overlap of

<strong>Q.  What kinds of radiation pass through the atmosphere, and
what kinds are absorbed?</strong>
<p>

<strong>A.</strong>  Visible radiation ranges from about 0.35 to
about 0.75 micrometers in wavelength. Very little visible radiation is absorbed
by gases in the atmosphere. About 30-31 percent of incoming solar radiation is
reflected and about 19 percent more is
absorbed, mostly by clouds and particulate matter rather than by carbon dioxide
and water vapor and oxygen. Those gases absorb a small amount of visible light,
but not much. This is in contrast to
the infrared (wavelengths greater than about 0.75 micrometer) radiation emitted
by the earth's surface. This radiation has wavelengths mostly between about 2
and 20 micrometers and over 90% of it is absorbed by water vapor, carbon
dioxide, methane, ozone, nitrous oxide, fluorocarbons, and other radiatively
active (&quot;greenhouse&quot;) gases on the way up.
<p>

Radiatively active gases are active in specific
wavelengths of radiation. For example,
if we could see in the infrared spectrum between 5 and 8 micrometers, we could
not see the earth's surface (even on a clear day) from an aircraft at 10 km
altitude. This is because water vapor
is &quot;opaque&quot; in those wavelengths, and there is water vapor in the atmosphere
even when there are no clouds. On the
other hand, on a clear day, you can see snow-capped mountains pretty clearly at
distances of over 100 km, because water vapor is transparent in the visible
wavelengths. Admittedly, at large
distances (e.g., about 100 km), things usually get pretty hazy because of light
scattering by particulate matter and other aerosols in the atmosphere, which
increase with line-of-sight distance. However, this reduction in visibility is not due to absorption by
atmospheric gases. Because
&quot;seeing&quot; in the infrared is not a part of most people's everyday
experience (unless they work for the border patrol or as a bombardier), it is a
little difficult to come up with &quot;everyday&quot; examples of what things
would be like, for comparison with &quot;everyday&quot; visibility.
<p>

Probably the best example from
&quot;everyday&quot; experience in the visible range, at least for those of us
who fly a lot, is to notice that the moon is not any brighter when you're
flying above 80% of the atmosphere than it is at the ground on a clear night. (Checking this by looking at the sun is NOT
recommended, you can injure your retina pretty badly that way). If you live near the mountains, you can vary
your elevation without having to fly. Also, a temperature map of the United States reveals that surface
temperature is more related to latitude and distances from the coast than to
elevation; the amount of solar radiation available to warm the earth's surface
is about the same at high elevations as it is near sea level. In fact, at a given latitude it's often
colder at higher elevations (one would expect it to be warmer if higher
elevations get more solar radiation), but this is due to factors other than
solar radiation.
<p>

Solar radiation&quot; and &quot;visible
light&quot; are not exactly the same thing. Solar radiation contains some wavelengths less than 0.35 micrometers,
and some longer than 0.75 micrometers. Fortunately for us and other living things, most of the ultraviolet
radiation (wavelengths shorter than visible) from the sun is picked off in the
high atmosphere. This highly energetic
radiation can strip electrons from atoms, causing the ionosphere and its
associated phenomena such as aurora and the variations in your radio's ability
to pick up distant broadcasting stations. Ozone in the middle and high stratosphere also picks off a lot of
ultraviolet radiation, thereby preventing it from reaching the surface and
causing skin cancers. The atmosphere's
ability to absorb radiation drops off sharply between about 0.3 micrometers
(near-visible ultraviolet) and 0.4 micrometers (visible blue-violet). Thus, we are protected from the harmful
ultraviolet radiation, but still can see clearly for large distances. This differentiation is not always made in
meteorology textbooks, so students sometimes come away thinking that the small
percentage of &quot;solar radiation&quot; absorbed by the atmosphere is a part
of the visible spectrum; instead, a lot of it is in the ultraviolet.

<strong>Q.  Why do clear winter nights tend to be colder
than cloudy ones; and why is the daily temperature variation in the desert
greater than that found in a moist environment?</strong>
<p>

<strong>A.</strong>  For this question, it is
helpful to differentiate between absolute humidity and relative humidity. Absolute humidity refers to the amount of
water vapor actually in the air, which can be higher than 2% of the
atmosphere's mass if it's very warm, but is limited to around 0.1% or less of
the atmosphere's mass if it's colder than about zero degrees Fahrenheit. Relative humidity is the amount of water vapor
actually in the air expressed as a percentage of the amount that could be there
(at a given temperature) given the amount of heat the atmosphere has available
to maintain water molecules in the vapor state (i.e., without condensing to
liquid water). At low temperatures, the
air can't maintain much water in the vapor state, but at high temperatures it
can. (In hot, dry, weather, sweat evaporates faster because the surrounding air
contains a lot less water vapor than it can maintain.) Over a desert, the absolute humidity can be
pretty high (e.g., in the Middle East, near the Mediterranean Sea), but the
associated high temperatures typically allow much more water to be maintained
in the vapor state than there actually is, so the relative humidity is
typically low (but not always, fog occurs over coastal deserts, but that's
another subject).
<p>

Clouds absorb a lot of outgoing (infrared)
radiation, and re-radiate it in all directions including back down to earth. On
nights when clouds are sparse or nonexistent, much less radiation comes back to
us and more goes through the atmosphere out to space. This explains the large amount of radiative cooling at night in
deserts, where clouds are sparse or nonexistent even though the ABSOLUTE
humidity can be high. On clear, cold, winter nights, the lack of clouds is
complimented by a low amount water vapor actually in the air (because it's
cold, not much vapor can be there), so that the amount of outgoing infrared
radiation absorbed by the atmosphere is reduced, and more escapes to space. In both cases, the increased nighttime
cooling increases the daily temperature range.
<p>

Also, in many deserts, the thermal conductivity
of the (dry) soil is really small, especially in a sandy desert where the soil
particles are relatively large and there is a lot of space for air in
between. This means that less heat is
transported to, and stored in, the soil during the day. When you visit the beach, you may notice
that the surface sand is hot while an inch below the surface it is much cooler
(nothing like the Tennessee clay in my backyard). When the sun goes down, that hot surface is radiating a lot of
energy away very quickly and there isn't much heat in the subsurface
&quot;bank&quot; to draw on. The result
is some pretty low surface temperatures in the wee hours of the morning. In summary, the reduced thermal inertia near the
desert surface explains the wider variations in temperature, as compared to an
agricultural area, for example.
<p>

Also, the dew point is a big influence on
minimum temperatures. Once the dew
point is reached, the conversion of water molecules from gas to a liquid
releases a bunch of heat (ca. 2500 J/g)* which tends to keep the temperature
from falling further. In deserts, even
though the ABSOLUTE humidity might be pretty high (on a really hot day), the
RELATIVE humidity tends to be low, so that the air can cool a lot before the
dew point is reached. This allows
greater cooling at night. On the clear
winter nights the air is usually dry to begin with (after all, no clouds were
formed) so, it can cool off a lot before getting to the dew point (or, to the
frost point).
<p>

* If you lick your hand and blow in it you will
notice that your skin cools off. In the
same way evaporation of sweat cools me off during the warm afternoon that I am
refereeing a soccer match, and panting can help even more (that's how dogs keep
cool). What is happening is that a lot
of energy is required to get the water molecules from the liquid state to the
much more energetic gaseous state, and that (heat) energy comes from the
surface from which the molecule is evaporated (e.g., your skin). When the reverse happens (vapor condenses to
liquid) the molecules lose energy, which is realized as heat. More water vapor can coexist with warm air
than with cold air; in warm air, more heat energy is available to maintain the
water molecules in their (more energetic) gaseous state. If the air cools, then some energy will be
lost by the water molecules and some of them will revert to the liquid state.

<strong>Q.  Is it possible to separate the carbon and oxygen from
CO<SUB><FONT SIZE=-1>2</SUB></FONT> as is possible with other molecules?</strong>
<p>

<strong>A.</strong>  The problem in separating the carbon and oxygen from
CO<SUB><FONT SIZE=-1>2</SUB></FONT> is that CO<SUB><FONT SIZE=-1>2</SUB></FONT>
is a VERY stable molecule, because of the bonds that hold the carbon and oxygen
together, and it takes a lot of energy to separate them. Most schemes being
considered now involve conversion to liquid or solids. One present concept
for capturing CO<sub><font size=-1>2</sub></font>, such as from flue gases of boilers, involves chemical
reaction with MEA (monoethanol amine). Other techniques include physical
absorption; chemical reaction to methanol, polymers and copolymers,
aromatic carboxylic acid, or urea; and reaction in plant photosynthetic
systems (or synthetic versions thereof). Overcoming energetic hurdles is a
major challenge; if the energy needed to drive these reactions comes from
burning of fossil fuels, there may not be an overall gain. One aspect of
the current research is the use of catalysts to promote the reactions. (In
green plants, of course, chlorophyll is such a catalyst!) One area of
current research is looking at using cellular components to imitate
photosynthesis on an industrial scale. For example, see
http://www.ornl.gov/ornl94/looking.html which describes research of the
Chemical Technology Division at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.

<strong>Q.  I am curious about the global warming potential of water vapor.  Do you
know if estimates are done of this in the same way as global warming potentials are
calculated for other greenhouse gases?  I am also interested in why no mention is
ever made of the enhanced greenhouse effect caused by anthropogenic emissions of water
vapor.  Are the anthropogenic emissions not significant?</strong>
<p>

<strong>A.</strong>  Water vapor is indeed a very potent "greenhouse" gas, in terms of
its absorbing and re-radiating outgoing infrared radiation. It is commonly not
mentioned as an important factor in global warming, because it is not clear that
the atmospheric concentration (as compared with CO<sub><font size=-1>2</sub></font>,
methane, etc.) is rising. Some (Richard Lindzen at MIT, prominently) have argued that
the uncertain potential feedbacks involving water vapor represent a serious
shortcoming in models of climate warming. See the following online resource for a
good discussion of this issue:

<strong>Q.  Is there environmental impact/concern (greenhouse emissions) associated
with technologies using CO<sub><font size=-1>2</sub></font> (e.g. dry ice blasting,
supercritical cleaning, painting, etc.,).  If so, are there current or impending
regulation specific to their use?</strong>
<p>

<strong>A.</strong>  "Most of the CO<sub><font size=-1>2</sub></font> used in these
kinds of applications is recovered from processes like fermentation and it is either
CO<sub><font size=-1>2</sub></font> that it is being extracted from the atmosphere by
plants or CO<sub><font size=-1>2</sub></font> that would have been released from
fossil fuel burning anyhow.  In essence it passes through this kind of use rather
than being emitted immediately and there is no extra CO<sub><font size=-1>2</sub></font>
produced". <font size=-1>[GM]</font>
<p><hr>
<p>


<strong>Q.  Could you tell me, please, if I have 1 gallon of fuel in my car, how many
(units?) of CO<sub><font size=-1>2</sub></font> will be emitted? Is there any difference
if the car 4 or 6 or 8 cylinders or in respect of horse power in percentage?</strong>
<p>

<strong>A.</strong>  A good estimate is that you will discharge 19.6 pounds of
CO<sub><font size=-1>2</sub></font> from burning 1 gallon of gasoline.  This does not
depend on the power or configuration of the engine but depends only on the chemistry
of the fuel.  Of course if the car gets more miles per gallon of gasoline, you will
get less CO<sub><font size=-1>2</sub></font> per unit of service rendered (that is,
less CO<sub><font size=-1>2</sub></font> per mile traveled).<font size=-1>[GM]</font>

<strong>Q.  How much CO<sub><font size=-1>2</sub></font> do you get from combustion of
fossil fuels?  How can the mass of the CO<sub><font size=-1>2</sub></font> be greater
than the mass of the fuel burned?</strong>
<p>

<strong>A.</strong>  Let us illustrate with the combustion of natural gas (methane).
<p>

C = carbon, atomic weight approximately 12
<br>
H = hydrogen, atomic weight approximately 1
<br>
O = oxygen, atomic weight approximately 16
<p>

CH<sub><font size=-1>4</sub></font> = methane, molecular weight approximately 16
<br>
O<sub><font size=-1>2</sub></font> = molecular oxygen, molecular weight approximately 32
<br>
CO<sub><font size=-1>2</sub></font> = carbon dioxide, molecular weight approximately 44
<br>
H<sub><font size=-1>2</sub></font>O = water, molecular weight approximately 18
<p>

For combustion of methane
<p>

CH<sub><font size=-1>4</sub></font> + 2O<sub><font size=-1>2</sub></font> =
CO<sub><font size=-1>2</sub></font> + 2H<sub><font size=-1>2</sub></font>O
<p>

So, combustion of 16 mass units (grams, pounds, whatever) of methane
produces 44 mass units of carbon dioxide and 36 mass units of water while
consuming 64 mass units of oxygen.

<strong>Q.  Is there any ONE person who discovered global warming? If not, what year was
global warming discovered?.</strong>
<p>

<strong>A.</strong>  The first person to have predicted that emissions of carbon dioxide
from the burning of fossil fuels would cause a global warming is considered to be
S. Arrhenius, who published in 1896 the paper "On the influence of carbonic acid in the
air upon the temperature of the ground." That atmospheric carbon dioxide was actually
increasing was confirmed beginning in the 1930s, and convincingly so beginning in the
late 1950s when highly accurate measurement techniques were developed (the most
famous demonstration of this is in C.D. Keeling's record at Mauna Loa, Hawaii). By
the 1990s, it was widely accepted (but not unanimously so) that the Earth's surface
air temperature had warmed over the past century. An ongoing debate is whether such a
warming can, in fact, be attributed to increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

<strong>Q. I would like to know whether or not significant amounts of soil organic
matter (SOM) and freshly fallen litter in a forest ecosystem can be degraded

CO<sub><font size=-1>2</sub></font>.  In other words, can I consider that entire
CO<sub><font size=-1>2</sub></font> emitted from soil is derived from biological
processes?</strong>
<p>

<strong>A.</strong> Earliest quantitative measurements indicate that decomposition
can be entirely attributed to biological processes.

<strong>Q. I understand that atmospheric concentrations of CO<sub><font size=-1>2</sub></font>
are increasing, but when I look at a graph (for example, <a href="/trends/co2/sio-mlo.htm">
Keeling's Mauna Loa data</a>), the curve is squiggly. For half of each year, the
concentrations increases, and for the other half it decreases. What is the reason for this?</strong>
<p>

<strong>A.</strong> The variations within each year are the result of the annual cycles
of photosynthesis and respiration. Photosynthesis, in which plants take up carbon
dioxide from the atmosphere and release oxygen, dominates during the warmer part of the
year; respiration, by which plants and animals take up oxygen and release carbon dioxide,
occurs all the time but dominates during the colder part of the year. Overall, then,
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere decreases during the growing season and increases
during the rest of the year. Because the seasons in the northern and southern
hemispheres are opposite, carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is increasing in the
north while decreasing in the south, and vice versa. The magnitude of this cycle is
strongest nearer the poles and approaches zero towards the Equator, where it reverses
sign. The cycle is more pronounced in the northern hemisphere (which has relatively
more land mass and terrestrial vegetation) than in the southern hemisphere (which is
more dominated by oceans). The <a href="http://www.cmdl.noaa.gov/ccg/" target="resource window">Carbon Cycle Group</a>
of the NOAA <a href="http://www.cmdl.noaa.gov/" target="resource window">Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory (CMDL)</a>,

<strong>Q. How may I perform CO<sub><font size=-1>2</sub></font> calculations of the carbon dioxide system in
seawater?</strong>
<p>

<strong>A.</strong> The <i>Program Developed for CO<sub><font size=-1>2</sub></font> System Calculations</i>
(ORNL/CDIAC-105), recently released by Ernie Lewis, Department of Applied Science,
Brookhaven National Laboratory, and Doug Wallace, Abteilung Meereschemie, Institut
fuer Meereskunde, was developed to help calculate inorganic carbon speciation
in seawater.<p>

This program, <strong><a href="/oceans/co2rprt.html">CO2SYS</strong></a>, performs
calculations relating parameters of the carbon dioxide system in seawater
and freshwater by using two of the four measurable parameters of the CO<sub><font size=-1>2</sub></font>
system [total alkalinity (TA), total inorganic CO<sub><font size=-1>2</sub></font> (TCO<sub><font size=-1>2</sub></font>), pH, and either fugacity
(fCO<sub><font size=-1>2</sub></font>) or partial pressure of CO<sub><font size=-1>2</sub></font> (pCO<sub><font size=-1>2</sub></font>)] to calculate the other two parameters
at a set of input conditions (temperature and pressure) and a set of output
conditions chosen by the user.
