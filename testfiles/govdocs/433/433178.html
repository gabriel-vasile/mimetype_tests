21 CFR Parts 510 and 520

 
New Animal Drugs; Change of Sponsor

AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS.

ACTION: Final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the animal 
drug regulations to reflect a change of sponsor for two approved new 
animal drug applications (NADAs) and an approved abbreviated new animal 
drug application (ANADA) from Lambert-Kay, A Division of Carter-
Wallace, Inc., to Church & Dwight Co., Inc. The drug labeler code for 
Church & Dwight Co., Inc., is also being listed.

DATES: This rule is effective June 27, 2002.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Lonnie W. Luther, Center for 
Veterinary Medicine (HFV-101), Food and Drug Administration, 7500 
Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855, 301-827-0209, e-mail: 
<A HREF="mailto:lluther@cvm.fda.gov">lluther@cvm.fda.gov</A>.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Lambert-Kay, A Division of Carter-Wallace, 
Inc., P.O. Box 1001, Half Acre Rd., Cranbury, NJ 08512-0181, has 
informed FDA that it has transferred ownership of, and all rights and 
interest in, NADA 101-497 for TINY TIGER (dichlorophene/toluene) 
Worming Capsules, NADA 101-498 for LK (dichlorophene/toluene) Worming 
Capsules, and ANADA 200-028 for EVICT (pyrantel pamoate) Liquid Wormer 
to Church & Dwight Co., Inc., 469 North Harrison St., Princeton, NJ 
08543-5297. Accordingly, the agency is amending the regulations in 
Secs. 520.580 and 520.2043 (21 CFR 520.580 and 520.2043) to reflect the 
transfer of ownership.
    Church & Dwight Co., Inc., has not been previously listed in the 
animal drug regulations as a sponsor of an approved application. 
Following these changes of sponsorship, Lambert-Kay is no longer the 
sponsor of any approved applications. Accordingly, 21 CFR 510.600(c)(1) 
and (c)(2) is being amended to add entries for Church & Dwight Co., 
Inc., and to remove the entries for Lambert-Kay. Also, Sec. 520.2043 is 
being revised to reflect a current format.
    This rule does not meet the definition of ``rule'' in 5 U.S.C. 
804(3)(A) because it is a rule of ``particular applicability.'' 
Therefore, it is not subject to the congressional review requirements 
in 5 U.S.C. 801-808.

21 CFR Part 510
    Administrative practice and procedure, Animal drugs, Labeling,

    Therefore, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and under
