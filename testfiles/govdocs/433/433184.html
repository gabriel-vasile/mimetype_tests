<h1>Beyond Bloodletting:<br>
  FDA Gives Leeches a Medical Makeover</h1>

<p><i>By Carol Rados</i></p>

<p>     For thousands of years, leeches
have been worming their way in and out of medicine as a questionable cure for
anything from headaches to gangrene, reaching their height of medicinal use in
the mid-1800s. Today, the slimy aquatic creatures are making a comeback as a
legitimate treatment that can help heal skin grafts and restore blood
circulation. Their primary function is to drain blood. Pooled blood around a
wound can threaten tissue survival.</p>

<p> In June 2004, the Food and Drug Administration cleared the first application 
  for leeches <i>(Hirudo medicinalis)</i> to be used in modern medicine as medical 
  devices. By definition, a medical device is an article intended to diagnose, 
  cure, treat, prevent, or mitigate a disease or condition, or to affect a function 
  or structure of the body, that does not achieve its primary effect through a 
  chemical action and is not metabolized.</p>

<p>     Surgeons who do plastic and
reconstructive surgery find leeches especially valuable when regrafting
amputated appendages, such as fingers or toes. Severed blood vessels in such
cases often are so damaged that they lack the ability to clear the area of
blood. In these cases, it is difficult for the surgeon to make a route for
blood to leave the affected part and return to circulation.</p>

<p>     &quot;The idea behind the
leeches is to cause blood to ooze so that the body's own blood supply will
eventually take over and the limb can go on and survive,&quot; says Rod J.
Rohrich, M.D., president of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons and
chairman of the Department of Plastic Surgery at the University of Texas
Southwestern Medical Center. Leeches apply the perfect amount of suction to get
the blood flowing. But Rohrich also says he uses the leeches only when there's
a compromised situation, such as following surgery, &quot;when the patient's
own blood supply isn't adequate.&quot;</p>

<p>     Packing a one-two chemical
punch, the benefit of leech therapy comes not from the amount of blood that is
extracted, but in the powerful anti-clotting agent hirudin, contained in the
parasite's saliva, which keeps blood flowing freely. At the same time, leeches
emit a natural anesthetic that minimizes pain during their feast.</p>

<p>     Having disk-shaped suckers on
each end of their bodies helps leeches feed, as well as hang on. The number of
leeches used varies with each patient--typically two or three leeches are
applied to the body until they drop off after about 40 minutes, and then the
process is repeated with a new leech &quot;team.&quot; At $7 to $10 apiece,
their expense won't break budgets of physicians or hospitals.</p>

<p>     The FDA considered safety data
as part of reviewing the marketing application for the leeches submitted by
Ricarimpex SAS of Eysines, France. In addition, the agency studied published
literature on the use of leeches in medicine, how the leeches are fed, their
environment, and the personnel who handle them.</p>

<p>     Leeches were already being used
in hospitals. A 1976 law has allowed companies that raised and sold medical
leeches before that year to continue doing so. Newcomers seeking to market
leeches for medical purposes, however, were required by the 1976 law to gain
FDA approval.</p>

<p>     You won't find the type of
leeches approved for medical use in a lake, river, or swamp. Rudy Rosenberg, owner
and vice president of Leeches USA Ltd., the initial importer and distributor
for Ricarimpex in the United States, says the leeches are raised under optimum
conditions in controlled basins and laboratories. The facilities are certified,
and all lots are tracked. This, he says, protects patients from infection.
Leeches drop off after &quot;feeding,&quot; and must be treated as infectious
waste material. Rosenberg says that he knows of no case of leech-borne
infection having been reported.</p>

<p>     How do people react to being
treated with these slimy parasites? &quot;Initially, they're repulsed by the
idea of leeches as a treatment,&quot; says Rohrich, &quot;but eventually, they
come to terms with the fact that it may be saving their lives.&quot;</p>
