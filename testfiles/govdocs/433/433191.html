			<blockquote>
				
			  <p><span class="bodytext">William A. Cooper, artist and preacher gives the story of his 
				life as follows:</span></p>
				
			  <p><span class="bodytext">&quot;My work has been my life. Whatever degree of succes I have 
				had has come about, I believe, as a result of my dogged determination 
				to do something tangible for my race.</span></p>
				
			  <p><span class="bodytext">&quot;I was born in the country near Hillsboro, N.C. As a small 
				boy I worked on the farm. I worked in the tobacco fields, worming 
				and stemming tobacco as well as in the cotton fields. For about 
				four months in the winter I attended a Mission school in Hillsboro 
				for negros. In summer time I worked as a janitor and some times 
				as a cook or house boy.</span></p>
				
				<p><span class="bodytext">&quot;My father was an ordinary field hand who loved to train possum dogs. My mother had a grammar school education
				and at the age of fourteen taught other boys and girls how to read and write.</span></p>
				
			  <p><span class="bodytext">&quot;When I was about fourteen I began to support myself, and 
				soon there after went to the Industrial Institute at High Point, 
				N.C. as a work student. I worked on the school farm, got up at 
				five o'clock in the morning to milk the cows, plow and hoe cotton 
				and corn, and anything else that needed to be done. While I was 
				at this school I also took up brick laying along with my other 
				studies.</span></p>
				
			  <p><span class="bodytext">&quot;From High Point I went to the National Religious Training 
				School at Durham, N.C. There I took the four year Theological 
				Course. Still working my way through school, I received the Bachelor 
				of Theology Degree from that institution.</span></p>
				
			  <p><span class="bodytext">&quot;As soon as I had finished I went to Wilson, N.C. where 
				I started out as an insurance man, and at the same time preaching 
				at a small church on Sunday.</span></p>
				
			  <p><span class="bodytext">&quot;I went from there to Burlington, N.C. where I was elected 
				Principal of a high school. I also served as Principal of the 
				high school at Graham, N.C. and taught at various other places. 
				All this time I was studying law at night and passed the State 
				Bar examination in 1922.</span></p>
				
			  <p><span class="bodytext">&quot;I became interested in art for the first time a few years 
				before this. I was in bed with a severe cold and while lying idle 
				I thought I would try to {Begin inserted text} {Begin handwritten} 
				do {End handwritten} {End inserted text} two pictures illustrating 
				the Biblical quotation: 'Wide is the gate and broad is the way 
				that leadeth to destruction, but straight is the gate and narrow 
				is the way that leadeth unto life, and few there be who find it.' 
				The members of my church were quite pleased with the pictures. 
				Their pleasure encouraged me a great deal, and from that time 
				on I began to paint other things. It was then I started painting 
				the members of my race, anybody I could get to sit-- field hands, 
				teachers, children, cooks or washerwomen. I had taken no formal 
				lessons at the time but I kept right on trying to see what I might 
				do.</span></p>
				
			  <p><span class="bodytext">&quot;I have attempted to show the real negro through art. I 
				believe that unless we have some record of the negro that is neither 
				burlesqued with black face nor idealized with senmentality, the 
				younger generation of negroes will be deprived of inspiration 
				from their own race.</span></p>
