    Following the withdrawal of approval of these NADAs, Biocraft 
Laboratories, Inc., IMPAX Laboratories, Inc., Jorgensen Laboratories, 
Inc., Pliva d.d., and Teva Pharmaceuticals USA are no longer sponsors 
of an approved application. Therefore, we are removing entries for 
these five sponsors from 21 CFR 510.600(c).
    As provided below, the animal drug regulations are amended to 
reflect the withdrawal of approvals and a current format. In addition, 
FDA has noticed that the regulations do not reflect approved NADA 065-
063 for Tetracycline Capsules sponsored by Eon Labs Manufacturing, Inc. 
At this time, the regulations in 21 CFR 520.2345a are amended to 
reflect this approved product.
    This rule does not meet the definition of ``rule'' in 5 U.S.C. 
804(3)(A) because it is a rule of ``particular applicability.'' 
Therefore, it is not subject to the congressional review requirements 
in 5 U.S.C. 801-808.
