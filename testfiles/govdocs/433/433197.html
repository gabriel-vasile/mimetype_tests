    WASHINGTON, March 19, 2002--Double D Meat Company Inc., a Bogalusa, La., 
    establishment, is voluntarily recalling approximately 14,100 pounds of 
    fresh, ready-to-eat pork sausage that may be contaminated with <i>Salmonella</i>, 
    the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service 
    announced today. </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 30">The products subject to recall are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>10 lb. cases of &quot;DD RANCH Hickory Smoked Country Made Sausage,&quot; which 
      bear the case code &quot;070,&quot; and the establishment code &quot;EST. 13211&quot; located 
      inside the USDA seal of inspection. The product was produced on March 11 
      and distributed to hotels, restaurants and institutions in Louisiana and 
      Mississippi.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>1-1.5 lb. packages of &quot;DD RANCH Hickory Smoked Country Made Sausage,&quot; 
      which bear the sell-by date &quot;SELL BY MAY 11 02&quot; and the establishment code 
      &quot;EST. 13211&quot; located inside the USDA seal of inspection. The product was 
      produced on March 11 and distributed to retail stores in Louisiana and 
      Mississippi. </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="text-indent: 30">&quot;Because of the potential for serious foodborne 
    illness, consumers who have purchased this product are urged not to eat it 
    but to return it to the place of purchase,&quot; said Margaret O'K. Glavin, 
    acting FSIS administrator. &quot;Diners also may wish to ask whether their meals 
    contain the recalled product.&quot;</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 30">The problem was discovered through routine FSIS 
    microbiological sampling. </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 30">Consumption of food contaminated with <i>
    Salmonella </i>can cause salmonellosis, one of the most common bacterial 
    foodborne illnesses. <i>Salmonella</i> infections can be life-threatening, 
    especially for infants, the frail or elderly and persons with chronic 
    disease, with HIV infection, or taking chemotherapy. The most common 
    manifestations of salmonellosis are diarrhea, abdominal cramps and fever 
    within eight to 72 hours. Additional symptoms may be chills, headache, 
    nausea and vomiting that can last up to seven days.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 30">FSIS has received no reports of illness 
    associated with consumption of this product. Anyone concerned about an 
    illness should contact a physician. </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 30">Consumers and media with questions about the 
    recall may contact Mike Stogner, owner, Double D Meat Company Inc., at (985) 
    735-6581. </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 30">Consumers with food safety questions can phone 
    the toll-free USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline at 1-800-535-4555. The hotline 
    can be reached from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. (Eastern Time) Monday through Friday, 
    and recorded food safety messages are available 24 hours a day.</p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0080C0">Reheat until steaming hot the following
    types of ready-to-eat foods: hot dogs, luncheon meats, cold cuts, fermented and dry
    sausage, and other deli-style meats and poultry products. Thoroughly reheating food can
    help kill any bacteria that might be present. If you cannot reheat these foods, do not eat
    them. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0080C0">Observe all expiration dates for perishable
    items that are precooked or ready-to-eat.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0080C0">Cook raw meat and poultry to safe internal
    temperatures before eating. The safe internal temperature for meat such as beef and pork
    is 160 ºF, and 180 ºF for poultry. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0080C0">Refrigerate raw meat and poultry as soon as
    possible after purchase, and cooked meat and poultry within two hours after cooking. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0080C0">Wash hands with hot, soapy water after
    handling these types of ready-to-eat foods. (Wash for at least 20 seconds). Also wash
    cutting boards, dishes, and utensils. Thorough washing helps eliminate any bacteria that
    might get on your hands or other surfaces from food before it is reheated. </font></td>
