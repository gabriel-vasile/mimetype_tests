      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Participants:</b> 
        Shaun Larson, Jim Pisarowicz, Darren Ressler </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Duration of Trip:</b> 
        3 hours</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>New Cave Surveyed: 
        </b>135 feet</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It sure seemed like 
        a long day. We had a blowing lead and all of us could not wait to get 
        back into the cave. Six o'clock finally rolled around though and we were 
        standing in the elevator building getting set for the next adventure up 
        Plummer's Pit.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Shaun climbed the 
        rope first into Shattered Hall. Darren would go in the middle since he 
        had never climbed a rope with ascenders. In this way we would have cavers 
        both above and below him in case he needed any assistance. Everything 
        went smoothly and before we knew it we were all standing in Shattered 
        Hall.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The climb out of Shattered 
        Hall did not look as serious as the Plummer's Pit climb. I attached the 
        climbing rope into my harness and with Shaun as belayer, began the climb. 
        It was fairly easy and soon I was worming my way through the floor of 
        another room. It was smaller than Shattered Hall, but just as broken up. 
        I called it the Shattered Sky.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The others scrambled 
        up into Shattered Sky, but unfortunately the passage ended in this room. 
        The ceiling was a breccia of red clay, limestone, chert, and sandstone 
        but did not go.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We then took out the 
        survey gear and began the mapping of these rooms and the pits that eventually 
        led down to the level of the tour trail. This was most interesting survey 
        as we had to hang off our rope while we measured the distances or read 
        our instruments. All the time we were doing this we were being showered 
        by debris knocked loose from above.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fortunately many of 
        the survey shots were vertical and before long we were tying our survey 
        into the previous point at the bottom of the drop. The only bad part of 
        the day was that we had topped out Plummer's Pit.</font></p>
