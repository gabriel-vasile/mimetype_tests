Agricultural Summary

                  WARMER TEMPERATURES IMPROVED CROP CONDITIONS                  

The State experienced warm, wet weather this week, according to the USDA, 
NASS, Georgia Field Office.  High temperatures averaged from the upper 60's 
to mid-70's for most of the week with average lows in the high 30's and low 
40's.  On Sunday, a cold front moved through the State causing the 
temperature to drop back down into the low 50's.  There was heavy rainfall on 
Thursday which was accompanied by damaging winds, especially in the 
southwest.  Recent rains have filled ponds and streams and suppressed 
existing deficits.  Soil moisture conditions were rated at 0% very short, 4% 
short, 67% adequate, and 29% surplus.

Warmer temperatures improved crop conditions in pastures and vegetables.  
Some farmers applied fertilizer to pastures.  Small grains continued to do 
well.  The lack of hay and a long winter had livestock producers scrambling 
for options to provide forage for their animals.  Some producers resorted to 
selling cattle.  Apple growers set out insect monitoring traps in the 
orchards in accordance with the apple growers integrated pest management 
program.

Farmers in the southern part of the state planned to begin planting corn in 
10-12 days with continued warm weather. Other activities included preparing 
land for spring crops, spreading poultry litter and lime, worming beef cattle 
and goats, and the routine care of poultry and livestock.  County Extension 
Agents reported an average of 4.7 days suitable for fieldwork.

DISTRICT COMMENTS
March 4, 2007

DISTRICT 1 - NORTHWEST
No comments available.


DISTRICT 2 - NORTH CENTRAL
Set out insect monitoring traps in the apple orchards.  This will begin a 
season long scouting program monitoring for Coddling Moth, Oriental Fruit 
Moth and Tufted Apple Budmoth. This program is part of the apple growers 
integrated pest management program they have been following for the past 4 
years.

Warmer conditions and heavy rain this week - rain total Thursday near 2.75 
inches - major activities include routine care of livestock and poultry and 
some pasture fertilization in early week.

Rain...short hay....cattle sales resulting.


DISTRICT 3 - NORTHEAST
Recent rainfall and warm weather should get things growing.  The lack of hay 
and a long winter have producers scrambling for options to provide forage for 
their animals.

Four -five inches of rain throughout county on Thursday.


DISTRICT 4 - WEST CENTRAL
We received 2.4 inches of rain, some minor wind damage to structures and some 
scattered trees blown over.


DISTRICT 5 - CENTRAL
Very heavy rains and severe weather on Thursday and Thursday night.  Small 
grains continue to look good and heavy hay feeding continues for livestock.  
Hay supplies getting critically short.

We have gotten our share of very wet weather recently which should suppress 
any deficits that were existing.

No storm damage in the county.  Fertilization of small grains ending.  Ponds 
and streams filling up from recent rains.  Thoughts turning to corn planting.

The southern portion of the county received 4 inches of rain or more.  Some 
places experienced damaging winds on Thursday.


DISTRICT 6 - EAST CENTRAL
Wheat coming on fast, corn planting will be in earnest in 10-12 days if 
weather continues warm.


DISTRICT 7 - SOUTHWEST
We received 0.84" of rainfall.


DISTRICT 8 - SOUTH CENTRAL
Preparing land to plant.  Spreading poultry litter and lime.  Applying 
herbicides to wheat. Tobacco transplants in greenhouse look good.  Worming 
beef cattle and goats.  Got almost 3" of rain in last two days.  No damage 
from bad weather reported.

Warmer temperatures have improved crop conditions in pastures and vegetables.  
Winter grazing has also benefitted from the warmer temperatures.


DISTRICT 9 - SOUTHEAST
On Thursday 1.5 inches of rain fell on most of the county.
