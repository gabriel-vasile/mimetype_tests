Sirs,
    I am writing to you because I have 3 boys, one has C.P. and
is in a wheel chair. IWe have noticed their aren't any situation
commidy's on telivision for the familly that has any physically
challenged kids on. No, being physically chalenged is not funny,
it can be down right crewl at times. But it can be very heart
worming and funny things can grow out from it. as well as
inspirational. If it is writen with heart and sensitivity, and it
can show the ignorant and uneducated that there are kids who do
have physicall handicapps
    A few years ago one of the neteworks had a show on about an
Autistic teen
"Life Goes On" a vary excolent show, and a good start to what I
am talking about, but it is only a start.
    Won't you please take my siggestion under advisement

thank you,
Dana McCleland
