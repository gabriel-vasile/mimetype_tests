                         County Agent Comments

"Weekend rain stopped all planting and ground preparation. The 1 3/4
inches of rain we received will help the rice that had been planted.
Early planted corn and soybeans are coming up and looking good."

                                    -- Don Respess, Bolivar

"Producers were able to get some soybeans and corn planted this week. We
received 1 to 2 inches of rain over the weekend, and that will keep
producers out of the fields for the upcoming week."

                                   -- Anthony Bland, Tunica

"Recent wet weather has hampered fieldwork in most cases. Farmers are
ready to start planting as soon as field conditions permit."

                              -- Patrick Poindexter, Alcorn

"The heavy rains that we received on Sunday will stop fieldwork for most
of the week."

                                  -- Andy Braswell, Leflore

"The corn crop is being planted 2-3 weeks later than established
recommended planting dates. Although this may not cause severe problems
with regard to temperatures and moisture, it may cause the crop to be
more susceptible to the Southwestern Corn Borer. If the pattern of
increase in this insect continues this year as it has in the past 2-3
years, it could mean significant problems with the pests this year."

                                        -- Pam Lee, Carroll

"Producers used this week to catch up on corn planting. Hybrid bermuda
grass is showing some frost damage from a couple of weeks ago."

                                          -- Mark Mowdy, Franklin

"Because of the frost during the earlier part of the week, one watermelon
grower is replanting about 30% of his crop."

                                    -- Thomas Brewer, Jefferson Davis

"Farmers were in the fields for about 5 days, but rains Friday and Sunday night
have halted all fieldwork. Rain Sunday night averaged about 1 to 1-1/2 
inches."
                                        	    -- Mack Young, Quitman   

"Sunshine and 10-to-20 MPH winds dried the ground out during the week. Burndown
looks good and is getting close in most fields to allow tillage. De-worming 
cattle, lice control, fly tags, and clean-up in feeding areas seems to be the
practice for cattlemen."

                                         -- Jimbo Burkhalter, Tallahatchie

"Producers were busy planting corn and applying burndown herbicides to fields.
Rain delayed all fieldwork over the weekend." 

                                                   -- Melvin Oatis, Benton

"Corn planting is about done and soybean planting is in full force. Burndowns
put out in the last 3 weeks are working very slowly."

                                               -- Stephen Winters, Grenada 

"Producers were able to get in a few days of fieldwork last week before the
rain came. Corn planting has just begun, but replanting is a good possibility.
Wheat and pastures are responding to the good growing conditions. Vegetable
planting has been limited."

                                             -- Dalton G. Garner, Prentiss

"Corn planting is almost complete. Early soybeans are being planted, and a
great deal of land is being burned down or fields cultivated to get ready
for planting."
	                                         -- Tommy Baird, Sunflower

"This has been a good week for corn planting and other fieldwork. Pastures
are also looking good after the rain."
	                                         -- Otis L. Davis, Madison

"Corn is being planted at a record rate; however, rain is forecast."

	                                         -- Kay Emmons, Montgomery

"At present 10-1/2 inches of rainfall have occurred in the last 24 hours."

	                                              -- Anita Webb, Scott

"This is the first good week we've had in some time to do any extended
fieldwork. However, we had a heavy rain last night that will slow fieldwork
down."

	                                            -- Stacy Brown, Monroe

"Corn planting is continuing with the drier weather we have had the last two
weeks. Baleage and haylage are being put up." 
	                                             -- Richard Hay, Amite

"A tornado dropped down on the west side of Lincoln County, causing severe
damage to trees and homes last night. Rains have left farming activities nearly
impossible for the moment."
	                                       -- Perry Brumfield, Lincoln

"Essentially, we have finished up corn planting. The first soybean seed went in
this week, but weekend showers held planting to a few hundred acres. Wheat
looks good, as do most pastures."
	                                           -- Terry Rector, Warren

"Warm, sunny days all week allowed pasture fertilization. Ryegrass hay harvest
and corn planting are proceeding in full swing. Hundreds of acres of ryegrass
were harvested for bale silage this week as producers took advantage of ideal
weather conditions. Beef and dairy producers are fertilizing their perennial
pastures of bahiagrass and bermudagrass in preparation for spring and summer
grazing/hay production. Roughly ten percent of our corn for silage acres were
planted this week as producers hit the fields on higher ground that was dry
enough for soil preparation. Heavy rains moved into our area Sunday evening
and are continuing this morning to further hinder corn planting and hay
harvest operations. Many dairy producers are greatly reducing their corn
acreage this year due to budget constraints not allowing them to invest in the
crop. Tough times lie ahead if summer weather conditions do not allow optimal
grass growth and milk production."
	                                          -- Lamar Adams, Walthall

"Soils were just getting dry enough to do fieldwork. Some corn has been planted
and land for cotton and peanuts is being broken up. Cattle are looking better
although some are still a little thin. Planted pines are growing well. Hay
supplies are holding up."
	                                            -- Lee Taylor, Forrest

"Soils were beginning to dry out and farmers were just being able to get into
the fields for planting."
	                                         -- Walter Walker, Jackson

"Rain Sunday afternoon, Sunday night and Monday morning has brought all field
operations to a halt. Strong straight line winds up-rooted trees around the
county and blew branches and limbs down. County schools are closed today as a
result. Part of Decatur is still without electrical power this morning."

	                                             -- Victor Lee, Newton

"Ryegrass pastures continue to excel with the improvement of the weather
conditions."
	                                     -- Billy Joe Lee, Pearl River

"Frost and temperatures below 32 degrees for 6 hours caused damage to
pasture grasses, emerging corn and watermelon. Early spring vegetables also
have been damaged from this late frost. This damage will have an affect on
pasture grasses, corn and watermelon crops. Pasture grasses have the potential
for recovery, but some corn and watermelon crops in extremely low areas will
have to be replanted due to long exposure to temperatures below 32 degrees
and frost."
	                                       -- Florieda K. Mason, Perry
