<p class=MsoNormal><a name=Paragraph1Begin></a>Klinge Corporation protests the
U.S. Marine Corps’s (USMC) award of a contract to Sea Box, Ltd., under request
for proposals (RFP) No. M67854-07-R-5060, for large field refrigeration systems
(LFRS).<!span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Klinge asserts that Sea Box’s
proposal should have been rejected as unacceptable.<a name=Paragraph1End></a></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><a name=OutcomeBegin></a>We deny the protest.<a name=OutcomeEnd></a></p>



<p class=MsoNormal>The solicitation provided for award of an indefinite&#8209;delivery/indefinite-quantity
contract for a base period of 1 year, with four 1-year options, to furnish up to
300&nbsp;LFRSs, as well as spare parts and training.<!span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Each LFRS was to be comprised of two primary
components:<!span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>(1) a 20-x-8-x-8-foot
insulated container, compliant with International Organization for
Standardization (ISO) standards, with double doors at one 8&#8209;x&#8209;8&#8209;foot
end, and (2) (to be installed at the opposite end of the container) an
electrically-powered refrigeration/freezing/heater unit (RU).<!span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span><o:p></o:p></p>



<p class=MsoNormal>The solicitation included a performance specification that
divided the specified performance characteristics into Critical Performance
Parameters that “must be met for minimum acceptability,” and other parameters
that were only objectives and were subject to tradeoff in the best value
analysis.<!span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>RFP at 1; Performance Specification
sections 1.0, 3.0, 3.1, 3.2.<!span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The solicitation
also incorporated the standard Trade Agreements Act (<!span style='mso-fareast-font-family:
"JFPEB H+ Century";mso-bidi-font-family:"JFPEB H+ Century";color:black'>19
U.S.C. sect. 2501 <u>et seq.</u></span>) clauses requiring (1) that offerors
certify, “[f]or all line items subject to the Trade Agreements clause of this
solicitation,” that “each end product to be delivered under this contract,
except those listed in paragraph (c)(2) of this provision, is a U.S.-made,
qualifying country, or designated country end product,” <!span style='mso-fareast-font-family:
CenturySchoolbook'>Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS)</span>
sect.&nbsp;252.225-7020, <!span style='mso-fareast-font-family:CenturySchoolbook'>Trade
Agreements Certificate; and (2) that </span>t<!span style='mso-fareast-font-family:
CenturySchoolbook'>he contractor “deliver under this contract only U.S.-made,
qualifying country, or designated country end products,” absent exceptions not
applicable here, DFARS </span>sect.&nbsp;<!span style='mso-fareast-font-family:CenturySchoolbook'>252.225-7021(c),
Trade Agreements.<!span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span></span>In this regard,
DFARS standard clause 252.225-7021(a)(12), Trade Agreements, incorporated in
the solicitation, provided that:</p>

<blockquote>U.S.-made end product means an article that --
<br />
<br />
(1)<!span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Is mined,
produced, or manufactured in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>;
or
<br />
<br />
(2)<!span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Is substantially
transformed in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
into a new and different article of commerce with a name, character, or use
distinct from that of the article or articles from which it was transformed.
</blockquote>

<p class=MsoNormal>Award was to be made to the offeror whose proposal
represented the “best value” based on four evaluation criteria:<!span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>operational effectiveness, past performance,
supportability, and price.<!span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>RFP, Federal
Acquisition Regulation (FAR) sect. 52.212-2, Evaluation&#8209;&#8209;Commercial
Items.<!span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Sea Box, Klinge and three other
offerors submitted proposals.<!span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Based on
its evaluation of the initial proposals, the Corps determined that Sea Box’s
proposal represented the best value and made award to that firm on <st1:date
Year="2007" Day="16" Month="7">July 16, 2007</st1:date>.<o:p></o:p></p>



<p class=MsoNormal>Klinge filed a protest with our Office challenging the
award, asserting that (1) the agency had improperly determined Klinge’s
proposal to be unacceptable for failure to satisfy a Critical Performance
Parameter in the performance specification&#8209;&#8209;the requirement that
the RU start and operate in ambient temperatures from &#8209;25°&nbsp;Fahrenheit
(F.) to +131° F, Performance Specification sect. 3.9.1, and (2) Sea Box’s proposal did
not comply with the Trade Agreements provisions included in the RFP.<!span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>In response to Klinge’s protest, the USMC
determined to take corrective action; it suspended performance under Sea Box’s
contract, established a competitive range of three&nbsp;offerors (including
Klinge and Sea Box), and conducted discussions.<!span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>
</span>We dismissed the protest as academic (B-309930, <st1:date Year="2007"
Day="27" Month="8">Aug. 27, 2007</st1:date>).<!span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>
</span><o:p></o:p></p>



<p class=MsoNormal>In its September 6 letters opening discussions, the agency
requested that Klinge and Sea Box (1) “[p]lease provide specific test data or
analysis that supports your claim of meeting the 131&nbsp;degrees F. operating
temperature Critical Performance Parameter”; and (2) “specifically identify the
country of origin for each line item number and . . . address your compliance
with DFARS 252.225-7021,” Trade Agreements.<!span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>
</span>Discussion Letters to Klinge and Sea Box, <st1:date Year="2007" Day="6"
Month="9">Sept.&nbsp;6, 2007</st1:date>.<!span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>
</span>Thereafter, the USMC requested final proposal revisions (FPR).<!span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Based upon its evaluation of FPRs, the agency
again determined that Sea Box’s proposal offered the best overall value.<!span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>In this regard, while both Sea Box’s and
Klinge’s proposals received acceptable ratings for the operational
effectiveness and supportability evaluation factors, Sea Box’s proposal was
evaluated as offering four value added features and five&nbsp;exceptional
attributes, while Klinge’s was evaluated as offering only two “value added”
features and three&nbsp;exceptional attributes.<!span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>
</span>Further, while Sea Box was rated low risk for past performance based on
57&nbsp;outstanding, 4&nbsp;satisfactory, 15 meets expectations, and
8&nbsp;neutral past performance ratings from 12&nbsp;references, Klinge was
rated moderate risk for past performance based on 3&nbsp;satisfactory, 3 meets
expectations, 8&nbsp;unsatisfactory, and 1 neutral rating from 3&nbsp;references.<!span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Overall, Sea Box’s proposal was evaluated as
technically superior to Klinge’s, and its evaluated price ($[REDACTED]) was
lower than Klinge’s ($[REDACTED]).<!span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Upon
learning of the resulting award to Sea Box, Klinge filed this protest with our
Office.<o:p></o:p></p>



<p class=MsoNormal>We have considered each of Klinge’s arguments and find that
they are without merit. We discuss Klinge’s primary arguments below.<o:p></o:p></p>



<p class=MsoNormal>TRADE AGREEMENTS REQUIREMENTS<o:p></o:p></p>



<p class=MsoNormal>LFRS<o:p></o:p></p>



<p class=MsoNormal>Klinge asserts that Sea Box’s proposal should have been

requirement in the solicitation requiring that the offeror provide “<!span

in China before being shipped to the U.S., it is clear that, for Sea Box’s

<p class=MsoNormal>In this regard, our review of the record supports the

<p class=MsoNormal><!span style='mso-fareast-font-family:CenturySchoolbook'>Thus,
it appears from the record that the information available to the contracting
agency prior to award concerning Sea Box’s contemplated production process
indicated that the Singapore refrigeration units would be simply bolted to the
Chinese containers in China, and that the work and processes necessary to
combine the two components into a functioning refrigerated container systems,
which would be substantial in terms of effort (whether measured by time
required or cost), instead would first occur in the United States.<!span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Based on this information, the USMC
determined that the components of Sea Box’s LFRS would be substantially

<p class=MsoNormal>Klinge asserts that the agency unreasonably determined that
Sea Box’s proposed LFRS satisfied a Critical Performance Parameter in section
3.9.1 of the performance specification&#8209;&#8209;the requirement that the RU
“start and operate in ambient external temperatures from -25° F. to +131°
F.”<!span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Specifically, Klinge questions
whether the agency had a basis for determining that Sea Box’s LFRS could start
and operate in ambient temperatures up to 131° F. <o:p></o:p></p>



<p class=MsoNormal>In this regard, market research conducted by the agency
prior to issuance of the solicitation led the agency to conclude that it was
“uncertain” whether Klinge and Sea Box could meet the ambient temperature
requirement with a commercial product.<!span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

<p class=MsoNormal>Klinge asserts that the Carrier letter did not furnish a reasonable
basis for finding Sea Box’s proposal compliant with the ambient temperature
requirement.<!span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>We disagree.<!span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Although Klinge maintains that Sea Box was
required to support its stated compliance with test data (similar to the data
Klinge supplied in its own proposal), the language in the discussion letter on
which Klinge relies did not establish a solicitation requirement for an offeror
to furnish test data in support of its proposal such that failure to furnish
such data required rejection of the proposal as unacceptable.<!span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Instead, as noted above, the agency’s discussion
letter simply requested that Sea Box (and Klinge) “[p]lease provide specific

furnished an analysis supporting its statement of compliance with the ambient
temperature range requirement.<!span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>In this
regard, we conclude that, given that the Carrier standard commercial
specification for Sea Box’s proposed refrigeration unit had indicated an
ambient range of up to 130° F., only 1&nbsp;degree below that required, Carrier’s
explanation that because Sea Box’s proposed container had a better “heat
leakage” rate than a standard container, the resulting LFRS would have a higher
(and thereby compliant) ambient temperature range than otherwise, provided the
agency with a reasonable basis for finding Sea Box’s proposed LFRS compliant
with the ambient temperature requirement.<o:p></o:p></p>

As further explained by Sea Box in response to the protest, the Chinese
container is manufactured with one end open; the refrigeration unit is seated
in a metal panel and the panel is simply bolted to the end of the container so
as to close off the container and thereby facilitate shipment to the U.S.<!span

China other than bolting the panel to the container for shipment purposes; all
other required work, including the addition of all other necessary parts and
all mechanical and electrical labor operations and integration, is performed at
Sea Box’s facility in the U.S.<!span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Sea Box

asserts that the communications between agency counsel and Sea Box’s director

amounted to discussions such that the agency was required to reopen discussions
with Klinge as well.<!span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Klinge states that,
had it been provided further discussions, “this would have included another
opportunity to potentially revise its pricing and, perhaps more importantly, to
