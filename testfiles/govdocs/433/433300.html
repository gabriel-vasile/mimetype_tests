<p align="left">(a) Charges will be made to a license for
quantities of sugar transferred under the license, effective as
of the date of transfer, when the licensee submits the
information required by Sec. 1530.204 or when the Licensing
Authority otherwise determines that a transfer has been made.</p>

<p align="left">(b) At the request of the licensee and upon
satisfactory and timely proof that the licensee has complied with
all of the requirements of this program, the Licensing Authority
will credit a license for:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left">(1) Quantities of sugar in the sugar
    containing products for which proof of export has been
    submitted in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 1530.205
    of this subpart, but such credit, if granted conditionally,
    will become final only when the Licensing Authority is
    satisfied that no refund, as drawback, of any duties paid on
    the importation of any sugars, syrups or molasses described
    in subheadings 1701.11.03, 1701.12.02, 1701.91.22,

    has been or will be claimed or received on the basis, or as a
    result, of the exportation of the sugar containing product;
    and</p>
    <p align="left">(2) Quantities of sugar charged to the
    license which the Licensing Authority determines have been
    destroyed, lost in the production process, or otherwise
    disposed of so as to render the use or exportation of a
    corresponding quantity of sugar in sugar containing products
    impossible or unnecessary.</p>
    <p align="left">(c) The Licensing Authority may revoke any
    credit previously made to a license if the Licensing
    Authority determines, on the basis of evidence obtained after
    the credit was granted, that the licensee had not complied
    with all of the requirements of this subpart or if the
    exported sugar containing products are re-exported or
    returned to the customs territory of the United States
    without having undergone a substantial transformation.</p>

<p align="left">(b) Each licensee requesting credit for valueless
sugar lost in normal product manufacture, or destroyed or
otherwise disposed of, shall also keep records to establish the
quantity of valueless sugar lost, disposed of, or destroyed.</p>

<p align="left">(c) All records required by this section to be
kept by a licensee shall be retained for at least 5 years after a
license is credited for the exportation of the sugar containing
product.</p>

records covered by this section available for inspection and

sugar containing product was manufactured, valueless sugar was
lost or destroyed, appropriate sugar containing products were
exported, drawback of duties paid on the importation of any
sugars, syrups or molasses described in subheadings 1701.11.03,

Enforcement.</strong></p>

<p align="left">(a) If at any time after receiving the proof of
export described in Sec. 1530.205 of this subpart, the Licensing
Authority determines that the export of sugar in the form of
sugar containing products corresponding to the quantity of sugar
transferred under the license did not occur, and has not been
otherwise disposed of or lost in the manufacturing process as
valueless sugar, and if the bond has been released under Sec.
1530.203, the Licensing Authority may hold the licensee liable
for the difference between the Number 11 contract price and the
Number 14 contract price, per pound of raw sugar, in effect on
the last market day before the date of transfer of the sugar or
the last market day before the end of the period during which
export was required, whichever difference is greater, times the
quantity of sugar, converted to raw value, that should have been,
but was not, exported in sugar containing products. In the event
no Number 11 contract price or Number 14 contract price is
reported by the New York Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, for
the relevant market day, the Licensing Authority may estimate
such price as he or she deems appropriate.</p>

<p align="left">(b) If at any time after receiving the licensee's
certification that no refund, as drawback, of any duties paid on
the importation of any sugars, syrups or molasses described in
subheadings 1701.11.03, 1701.12.02, 1701.91.22, 1701.99.02,
1702.90.32, 1806.10.42, or 2106.90.12 of the HTS has been or will
be claimed or received on the basis, or as a result, of the
exportation of any sugar containing product, the Licensing
Authority determines that a refund of such customs duties has
been claimed or received by the licensee or any other person, and
if the bond has been released under Sec. 1530.203, the Licensing
Authority may hold the licensee liable for the difference between
the Number 11 contract price and the Number 14 contract price,
per pound of raw sugar, in effect on the last market day before
the date of transfer of the sugar or the last market day before
the end of the period during which export was required, whichever
difference is greater, times the quantity of sugar, converted to
raw value, that should have been, but was not, exported in sugar
containing products. In the event no Number 11 contract price or
Number 14 contract price is reported by the New York Coffee,
Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, for the relevant market day, the
Licensing Authority may estimate such price as he or she deems
appropriate.</p>

<p align="left">(c) If at any time the Licensing Authority
determines that a licensee has failed to comply with the
requirements of this subpart, including the requirements of HTS
subheading 1701.11.02 and of the relevant provisions of
additional U.S. note 3, the Licensing Authority may, after notice
to the licensee, suspend or revoke the license issued to the
licensee under this program and may refuse to issue a license to
that manufacturer. The Licensing Authority may suspend or revoke
a license if claims are filed under 19 CFR part 191 for the
refund, as drawback, of any duties paid on the importation of any
sugars, syrups or molasses described in subheadings 1701.11.03,
1701.12.02, 1701.91.22, 1701.99.02, 1702.90.32, 1806.10.42, or
2106.90.12 of the HTS on the basis, or as a result, of the
exportation of a sugar containing product under this program or
if any other claim under 19 CFR part 191 is denied on the basis
that the sugar containing product was not exported.</p>

imposed by this subpart if such waiver or modification is
necessary or appropriate under unusual, unforeseen or
extraordinary circumstances and will not frustrate the purposes
of this program and if compliance with the relevant provisions of
HTS subheading 1701.11.02, additional U.S. note 3 is established

<p align="left">(b) Any manufacturer who, on September 30, 1990,
held a license which had a balance of charges and credits other
than zero and which is canceled pursuant to paragraph (a) of this
section may be issued a new license upon such manufacturer's
agreement to:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left">(1) Fully settle the balance outstanding on
    such previous license, by bringing such balance to zero;</p>

including the requirements that a manufacturer make a written
application for a license prior to the issuance of the license
and make a written application for a waiver under Sec. 1530.210
