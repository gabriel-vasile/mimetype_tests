Bulletins of the National Archives<br />

Number 8 (October 1956)</p>



<p>CONCLUSIONS</p>

<p>Several general observations may now be made regarding the appraisal

of modern public records, to wit:</p>

<p>First, the considerations that should be borne in mind in ascertaining

values in records cannot be reduced to exact standards. Our standards can

be little more than general principles. They can never be made precise,

though, of course, the series or types of records produced by a particular

public agency that meet certain general standards may be precisely identified.

The standards should never be regarded as absolute or final. At best they

will serve merely as guidelines to steer the archivist through the treacherous

shoals of appraisal.</p>

<p>Secondly, since appraisal standards cannot be made exact or precise,

it follows that they need not be applied with absolute consistency. Archivists

may use different criteria in evaluating records of different periods,

for what is valuable for a past age may be valueless for the present. The

American historian Justin H. Smith (1857-1930) observed that &quot;a great

deal is said by some people about 'rubbish,' but one investigator's 'rubbish'

may be precious to another, and what appears valueless to-day may be found

highly important tomorrow.&quot; (<a name="footnote14"></a><a

href="/research/alic/reference/archives-resources/appraisal-footnotes.html#footnote14">Footnote

14</a>). Archivists of different archival institutions may also use different

criteria in evaluating similar types of records, for what is valuable to

one archival institution may be valueless to another. Complete consistency

in judging informational values is as undesirable as it is impossible of

accomplishment. Diverse judgments may result in records on particular matters

being preserved at particular places, although the records arc not deserving

of general preservation. Diverse judgments may also spread the burden of

preserving the documentation of a country among its various archival institutions,

making one preserve what another may discard. Certain Federal records may

thus be more appropriately preserved in regional depositories than at the

National Archives because the information they contain is in such detail

that it can be preserved only in concentrated form at the national level

or because the information they contain is predominantly of a local or

regional rather than a national interest.</p>

<p>Thirdly, since appraisal standards cannot be made absolute or final,

they should be applied with moderation and common sense. An archivist should

keep neither too much nor too little. He should follow the Aristotelian

precept of &quot;moderation in everything, excess in nothing.&quot;</p>

<p>This precept, for that matter, is similar to two of Meissner's standards,

which are &quot;extremes are to be avoided,&quot; and that &quot;too great

an abstraction is an evil.&quot;</p>

<p>Fourthly, appraisals of records should not be based on intuition or

arbitrary suppositions of value they should be based instead on thorough

analyses of the documentation hearing on the matter to which the records

pertain. Analysis is the essence of archival appraisal. While appraising

the evidential values of records the archivist must take into account the

entire documentation of the agency that produced them. He should not make

his evaluations on a piecemeal basis or on the basis of individual organizational

units within an agency. He should relate the particular group of records

under consideration to other groups to understand its significance as evidence

of organization and function. His appraisals, it is apparent, are dependable

to the degree to which he has analyzed the origins and inter-relations

of records. Similarly, while appraising the informational values of records,

the archivist must take into account the entire documentation of society

on the matter to which the information relates. He must determine if the

particular group of records under consideration contains unique information

and if it has a form that makes it valuable as a source of information,

and only after he has done this should he enter into the realm of the imponderable -- into

questions of research importance. His appraisals of records, again, are

dependable to the degree to which he has analyzed all other available documentary

sources on the matter to which the records pertain.</p>

<p>Fifthly, if his analysis does not yield the information that is needed

in the appraisal of records, the archivist should seek the help of experts.

Obviously an archivist cannot be expected to know the research needs of

all scholarly disciplines. Occasionally he will be called on to evaluate

records that involve a knowledge beyond his sphere. In evaluating records

needed for disciplines in which he is not trained he should, if necessary,

seek the help of specialists in those disciplines. If the archival institution

is a very large one, a number of subject-matter specialists are likely

to be found on its staff whose special competencies can be brought to bear

on the evaluation of special groups of modern public records. If the institution

is small, the number of staff subject-matter specialists will be limited,

and the need for outside help will be greater. In the National Archives

a panel of experts was used to help evaluate the records of the General

Accounting Office, an agency of the legislative branch of the Government

that audits the fiscal operations of agencies of the executive branch.

(<a name="footnote15"></a><a href="/research/alic/reference/archives-resources/appraisal-footnotes.html#footnote15">Footnote

15</a>). The records offered by this office spanned the years 1776-1900

and comprised over 65,000 cubic feet. They obviously had very little value

for the evidence they contained of organization and function; but since

they covered the whole of the national history of the United States, they

were likely to contain incidental or accidental information on important

historical, economic, and social phenomena. Appraisal of these records

was an onerous task that could not very well be accomplished by any one

person, no matter how comprehensive his knowledge of research resources

and research needs might be. After the records were reviewed by various

subject-matter specialists on the stall of the National Archives, therefore,

help was obtained from specialists in the fields of military history, western

history, and public administration.</p>

<p>Sixthly, before seeking the help of experts the archivist should do

the basic analytical work that is preliminary to the appraisal of records.

He should first accumulate the data about the records in question that

are essential in determining the uniqueness and form of the information

contained in them. He should describe the various series to be appraised,

indicating their form and volume, the types of information available in

them, their relation to other groups or series that contain similar information,

their relation to published sources, and the like, in order that the scholars

consulted may more quickly get at the business of determining which particular

series or groups contain information valuable for investigations of various

matters and which contain this information in the most usable and condensed

form.</p>

<p>Seventhly, while exploring the interest of scholars in particular groups

of records, the archivist should assume the role of moderator. An archivist

dealing with modern records realizes that not all of them can be preserved,

that some of them have to be destroyed, and that, in fact, a discriminating

destruction of a portion of them is a service to scholarship. He is therefore

inclined to agree with the observation that &quot;too great an abstraction&quot;

in the appraisal of records &quot;is an evil,&quot; for he knows that any

scholar with a little intellectual ingenuity can find a plausible justification

for keeping almost every record that was ever produced. In evaluating certain

of the large series of records that are useful for social and economic

studies, therefore, he must take into account the practical difficulties

in the way of their preservation and bring these to the attention of the

scholars who are interested in preserving them. He must show that a careful

selection of the documentation produced by a modern government is necessary

if he is not to glut his stacks with insignificant materials that will

literally submerge those that are valuable. He must call attention to the

fact that a government has only a limited amount of funds for the preservation

of its documentary resources and that these funds must be applied judiciously

for the preservation of the most important of these resources.</p>
