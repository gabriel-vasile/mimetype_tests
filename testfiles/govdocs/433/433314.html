<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Dear ______</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Thank you for contacting
me.&nbsp; I am strongly against the President’s effort to weaken Social
Security and I am playing a leading role in Congress in our resistance to these
efforts.&nbsp; I am enclosing a copy of an article I wrote in the Boston Globe
last fall which gives my general position on the matter.&nbsp; The fact is that
if Social Security is credited with every penny that was paid in and will be
paid in for it - as it certainly should be - there is no crisis, and there does
not even to begin to be any difficulty until forty years or more from
now.&nbsp; There is plenty of time for us to make the small adjustments that
might need to be made in this system.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The one adjustment I do favor
is to apply the Social Security payroll tax to more of the income levels than
it currently covers.&nbsp; Right now, people who make $90,000 or below pay
Social Security tax on all of their income.&nbsp; This allows the wealthiest
people in our society to pay a far smaller percentage of their income in Social
Security taxes, while they have at the same time been benefiting from George
Bush's tax cuts.&nbsp; Levying the Social Security tax on all of income would
in itself produce enough revenue to forestall any need to make the kind of
drastic reductions in Social Security that are being argued.&nbsp; I don’t
think it would be wise to increase taxes on people who are now making between $90,000
and $115,000, since in this economy people in that range are hardly
wealthy.&nbsp; I am therefore inclined to support a break in the tax but then <span
class=SpellE>reimposing</span> it at about $125,000 of income.&nbsp; It could
also be that we could take the cap off, and <span class=GramE>engineer</span> a
slight reduction in the rate, so that some people would get a small reduction
while others would in fact begin to pay.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I believe that the notion
that we should substitute private stock accounts for some portion of Social
Security is gravely mistaken.&nbsp; Of course people who can afford it should
be investing in ways that will supplement their Social Security.&nbsp; But
Social Security is meant to be a minimum safety net.&nbsp; Clearly if we let
people invest with their Social Security money, even the best- informed will
make mistakes.&nbsp; Some of the smartest investors in the world were putting
their money into Enron, MCI, and other companies which have subsequently become
valueless.&nbsp; In </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Massachusetts</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> over the years we have seen some of the major banks -
The Bank of </span><st1:place><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>New England</span></st1:place><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>, for example - become valueless.&nbsp; If we follow
the Administration’s view that we should allow people to invest on their own,
the question we will then have is whether when these investments go bad as they
will in some cases, we are prepared to let people live in desperate poverty, as
was the case before the adoption of Social Security.&nbsp; I don’t think we
either will or should do that, which means that the notion that we can simply
let people buy stock and cut them off on their Social Security for that amount
is unrealistic.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Beyond that, allowing people
to divert a substantial portion of their Social Security into private accounts
breaks a commitment that has been made with those who have gone before
them.&nbsp; All of us who have paid into Social Security have done so knowing
that our payments were going to help support current retirees while those of us
who will retire later would get a similar benefit from people then
working.&nbsp; What the President proposes would require a borrowing of a
couple of trillion dollars at least, which will be a negative for the economy
as a whole, and could lead to pressure to further cut Social Security.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>While I will be fighting all
aspects of this, I have a particularly important role because I am the Senior
Democrat on the Committee on Financial Services, which has jurisdiction over
the financial industry, including the securities industry.&nbsp; One of my top
staffers has been assigned by me to the job of documenting the significant
costs that will be incurred if the Social Security system now becomes a
mechanism for people to make stock investments.&nbsp; The President argues that
we should give people a lot of choice in picking their own stocks, but since
this will be with funds restricted under Social Security, the costs of this will
be very significant.&nbsp; Social Security now administers a very large program
with very low administrative costs.&nbsp; The President’s proposal, which will
allow people to use Social Security proceeds for the stock market, would
significantly increase the percentage of administrative costs.&nbsp; And if the
response from the Administration is that this will not be expensive because
people will not have much choice but will have to put their money into one or
two designated funds, then they have undercut their own argument that the very
purpose of this is to allow people to decide where to put their own money.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Social Security was enacted
in 1936.&nbsp; It has worked extremely well in the nearly seventy years since
then.&nbsp; Poverty among older people in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt'>America</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> has substantially been reduced, and Social Security -
along with Medicare - is a major reason for that.&nbsp; There is no reason to
think that the program will begin to be in any difficulty for another forty
years or so.&nbsp; This means that the Social Security program will have been
in existence for well over one hundred years before we have to begin to make
any adjustment in the future, and even then we do not now know what kind of
adjustment we will have to make.&nbsp; If we raise the tax base, as I have
suggested, we will almost certainly not have to do very much at all.&nbsp; That
is why I am strongly resistant to the President’s effort to pretend that there
is a crisis when there is none, so that he could achieve his ideological goal
of undermining the Social Security system.</span></p>

Social Security Swindle”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>By
Barney Frank</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Sometimes
mixed metaphors say it best.&nbsp; Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan’s
call for significant reductions in Social Security can best be described as a case
of the fox in the chicken coop crying wolf.&nbsp; He is greatly exaggerating
the dimensions of a problem that he helped create.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Greenspan
recently said, “We have promised more than our economy has the ability to
deliver to retirees.”&nbsp; He argued that we have the choice either of raising
payroll taxes, which are regressive and economically burdensome, or reducing
cost-of-living adjustments while <span class=GramE>raising</span> the
retirement age.&nbsp; The assumption that leads him to pose this stark choice
is that the federal government does not have enough revenue available to
deliver the benefits we have promised retirees.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>What
he omitted to note is that if all of the payroll taxes that have been and will
be paid into Social Security are made available for Social Security payments as
they are supposed to be, the system is entirely solvent until 2042 at least.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>When
the Bush administration took office, we were on the path to accumulating the
level of surpluses sufficient for the federal government to meet this legal and
moral commitment to Social Security without causing severe fiscal
distress.&nbsp; Then <span class=GramE>came</span> the deficits of the last
four years, caused in substantial part by the large tax cuts pushed through
Congress by President Bush, predominately for the benefit of our wealthier
citizens and with the strong support of Greenspan.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Greenspan
argued in 2001 for the first Bush tax cut on the grounds that if we did not
enact it, the federal government would have too much money by 2010.&nbsp; It is
the absence of this “too much money” that now leads him to claim that we cannot
afford to meet our Social Security commitments.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Greenspan
rests his case not just on the revenues of the federal government but on the
broader economic picture.&nbsp; It is unlikely, he believes, that we will
produce enough wealth to pay the retirement benefits the law currently calls
for.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>He
stressed that the critical element in determining this will be the level of
savings in our economy, and he notes that “critical to national saving will be
the level of government, specifically federal government, saving.”&nbsp; But he
has helped lower that rate below what he says we need.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>To
quote the July 2004 Federal Reserve Monetary Policy Report: “As of the first
quarter of 2004, national saving…was still equal to just about 2 ½ percent of
GDP, compared with the recent high of 6 ½ percent in 1998.”&nbsp; Why is
national savings this year only one-third of what it was six years
earlier?&nbsp; The cause is “the deterioration in the unified budget since
2000.”&nbsp; Specifically, “measured net of estimated depreciation, federal
savings fell from 2 percent of GDP to minus 4 percent of the GDP over this
period.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Of
course, a major reason we face this situation is the Bush tax-cutting that
Greenspan endorsed.&nbsp; According to the report, “In large part, the rise in
the deficit is attributable to further rapid increases in spending on defense
and other programs and the loss of revenues resulting from the tax legislation
enacted in recent years.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>We
do face a problem in the financing of Medicare, but that is best seen as part
of our need to overhaul the way in which we pay for medical care in
general.&nbsp; But as to Social Security, it does not begin to need any
additional resources until 2042, and maybe not then if economic growth is
strong.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Even
then, the choices are not simply raising the payroll tax or cutting back
substantially on benefits but could include making some general revenues
available for some of the expenditures now covered under Social Security.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>That
would, of course, be difficult by a continuation of the policy of
simultaneously waging wars and enacting periodic large tax cuts, and I would be
heartened if Greenspan’s concern over the consequences of this pattern led him
to be more supportive of our efforts to break it.</span></p>
