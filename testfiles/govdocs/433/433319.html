September 14, 2007</p>
<p>I am writing to voice my concern and disgust with the state of the economy, and more specifically, the state of the market within the economy.  </p>

<p>I am a CMKX shareholder and this company has been shorted so badly that it was delisted, leaving me with valueless shares.  Hundreds of billions of shares of this stock were purchased or to be more accurate, shorted.  Naked shorting.  Naked shorting may be common in day to day operations on Wall Street, but when the brokers don't pay for their shares EVER, it leaves hundreds of thousands of Americans and Canadians with stock that is worth a fraction of its original value, if anything at all.  </p>

<p>I am also a USXP and GWGO shareholder and between the three companies, I couldn't sell my shares to buy a Greyhound ticket to Saskatchewan.  These brokers and market makers owe the common shareholder the real value of each real share and each phony share, plus dividends, plus interest on lost income, plus damages for market fraud.  This is no secret, and it needs to be corrected.  The offenders need to correct this massive fraud conspiracy and the victims need, no, demand compensation.  This problem won't go away on its own.  </p>

<p>The SEC is supposed to be the watchdog so that ordinary, hard-working citizens can invest their hard-earned dollars into the American economy and have peace of mind that their money is not being stolen via naked short selling aka fraud.  This blatant disregard for the Constitution of the United States of America must be stopped.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Ryan Bouchard
