    <b>Subject: </b>Software licensing issue</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">I recently, as part of a career change, I obtained several copies of
    Autodesk AutoCAD software. The assets were not needed and I intended to submit them for
    auction on a popular auction site. My auction was preemptively canceled; as though the
    auction site and Autodesk had the authority to declare my legally obtained assets
    valueless. It is nothing more than a (heretofore successful) heavy handed attempt to
    restrict legal commerce in a legal product for the sole purpose of coercing additional
    sales. These software assets belong to me and I should have some means for recapturing
    that capital if I so desire.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Below, is the shot-across-the-bow message that Autodesk's representatives
    sent to me (and to all those who attempt an AutoCAD action).</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">It's outrageous and needs to be changed.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">John Cavin</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">*****************</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">This firm represents Autodesk, Inc. (&quot;Autodesk&quot;) in connection
    with investigating instances of illegal duplication and/or distribution of its proprietary
    software products.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">We have reviewed your auction posted at http://www.ebay.com in which you
    have offered for sale, or have sold, copies of Autodesk's proprietary software. Please be
    advised that the Autodesk License Agreement prohibits the transfer of any Autodesk
    software license (under the Agreement, Autodesk grants you a &quot;nontransferable
    license&quot;) and thus even legitimate copies of the software may not generally be sold
    or otherwise transferred.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">My client views the unauthorized transfer of its proprietary software
    products very seriously and is prepared to pursue its civil remedies. However, Autodesk
    will forego the filing of a civil action, provided you immediately cease all attempts to
    sell any Autodesk software product. If we discover more activity of this sort, we will
    immediately seek to have your account barred from eBay permanently, and we will seek
    maximum legal remedies against you.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Accordingly, we must request that you respond to me within 48 hours.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Very truly yours,</p>
