<p><strong>National Surveillance Data for Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, and Syphilis</strong></p>
<p><a href="04pdf/trends2004.pdf">Print Version</a> (requires <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html">Adobe
      Reader</a>)</p>
<p>Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) remain a major public health challenge
  in the United States. While substantial progress has been made in preventing,
  diagnosing, and treating certain STDs in recent years, CDC estimates that 19
  million new infections occur each year, almost half of them among young people
  ages 15 to 24.<sup><a href="#ref1"><strong>1</strong></a></sup> In addition to the physical and psychological consequences
  of STDs, these diseases also exact a tremendous economic toll. Direct medical
  costs associated with STDs in the United States are estimated at $13 billion
  annually.<sup><a href="#ref2"><strong>2</strong></a></sup></p>
<p>    This document summarizes 2004 national data on trends in notifiable STDs &mdash; <a href="chlamydia.htm">chlamydia</a>,
    <a href="gonorrhea.htm">gonorrhea</a>, and <a href="syphilis.htm">syphilis</a> &mdash; that are published in CDC's report, <em>Sexually
    Transmitted Disease Surveillance 2004</em> (available at <a href="default.htm">www.CDC.gov/STD/stats</a>).
    These data, which are useful for examining overall trends and trends among
    populations at risk, represent only a small proportion of the true national
    burden of STDs. Many cases of notifiable STDs go undiagnosed, and some highly
    prevalent viral infections, such as <a href="../HPV/default.htm">human papillomavirus</a> and <a href="../Herpes/default.htm">genital
    herpes</a>,
    are not reported at all.</p>
<h3>  <strong><a name="trendschlamydia" id="trendschlamydia"></a>Chlamydia: Expanded Screening Efforts Result in More Reported Cases, But Majority
    of Infections Remain Undiagnosed</strong></h3>
<p>    <a href="../Chlamydia/default.htm">Chlamydia</a> remains the most commonly reported infectious disease in the United
    States. In 2004, 929,462 chlamydia diagnoses were reported, up from 877,478
    in 2003. Even so, most chlamydia cases go undiagnosed. It is estimated that
    there are approximately 2.8 million new cases of chlamydia in the United
      States each year.<sup><a href="#ref1"><strong>1</strong></a></sup></p>
<p>    The national rate of reported chlamydia in 2004 was 319.6 cases per 100,000
      population, an increase of 5.9 percent from 2003 (301.7). The increases
      in reported cases and rates likely reflect the continued expansion of screening
      efforts and increased use of more sensitive diagnostic tests, rather than
      an actual increase in new infections. </p>
<p><strong>Impact on Women</strong></p>
<p>    <img src="images/trends-chlam-rates.gif" alt="Female Chlamydia Rates, 2004" width="366" height="308" align="right" />Women, especially young women, are hit hardest by chlamydia. Studies have
      found that chlamydia is more common among young women than young men, and
      the long-term
      consequences of untreated disease for women are much more severe. The chlamydia
      case rate for females in 2004 was 3.3 times higher than for males (485.0
      vs. 147.1). However, much of this difference reflects the fact that women
      are far more likely to be screened than men. Females ages 15 to 19 had
      the highest chlamydia rate (2,761.5), followed by females ages 20 to 24
      (2,630.7).</p>
<p> African-American women are also disproportionately impacted by chlamydia.
  In 2004, the rate of reported chlamydia among black females (1,722.3) was more
      than 7.5 times that of white females (226.6). Because case reports do not
      provide a complete account of the burden of disease, researchers also evaluate
      chlamydia prevalence in subgroups of the population to better estimate
  the
      true extent of the disease. For example, data from chlamydia screening
  in family planning clinics across the United States indicates that roughly
  6
      percent of 15- to 24-year-old females in these settings are infected. </p>
<p> <strong>Importance of Screening</strong> </p>
<p>    Because chlamydia is most common among young women, CDC recommends annual
        chlamydia screening for sexually active women under age 26, as well as
        older women with
      risk factors such as new or multiple sex partners.<sup><a href="#ref5"><strong>5</strong></a></sup> Data from a study in
        a managed care setting suggest that chlamydia screening and treatment
      can reduce
      incidence of PID by over 50 percent.<sup><a href="#ref6"><strong>6</strong></a></sup> Unfortunately, many sexually active
        young women are not being tested for chlamydia, in part reflecting a
      lack of awareness
      among some providers and limited resources for screening.<sup><a href="#ref5"><strong>5,7</strong></a></sup> Recent research
      has shown that a simple change in clinical procedures &mdash; coupling chlamydia
      tests with routine Pap testing &mdash; can sharply increase the proportion
      of sexually active young women screened.<sup><a href="#ref8"><strong>8</strong></a></sup> Stepping up screening efforts is
      critical to preventing the serious health consequences of this infection, particularly
      infertility.</p>
<p>    While screening is critical for sexually active young women, improved testing
        and treatment among men could help reduce transmission to women. The
      availability of urine tests for chlamydia may be contributing to increased
      detection
        of the disease in men, and consequently the rising rates of reported
      chlamydia in men in recent years (from 99.6 in 2000 to 147.1 in 2004).</p>
<p class="pale-orange"><span class="ruddy"><strong>Health Consequences of Chlamydia</strong></span><strong><br />
  <br />
</strong>Chlamydia is a bacterial infection that can easily be cured with antibiotics,
      but it is usually asymptomatic and often undiagnosed. Untreated, it can
      cause severe health consequences for women, including <a href="../PID/STDFact-PID.htm">pelvic
      inflammatory disease</a>      (PID), ectopic pregnancy, and infertility. Up to 40 percent of females
      with untreated chlamydia infections develop PID, and 20 percent of those
      may become
      infertile.<sup><a href="#ref3"><strong>3</strong></a></sup> In addition, women infected with chlamydia are up to five times
      more likely to become infected with <a href="../HIV/default.htm">HIV</a>, if exposed.<sup><a href="#ref4"><strong>4</strong></a></sup> Complications from
      chlamydia among men are relatively uncommon, but may include epididymitis
      and urethritis, which can cause pain, fever, and in rare cases, sterility.</p>
<h3><strong><a name="trendsgonorrhea" id="trendsgonorrhea"></a>Gonorrhea: Disease Rate Falls to Historic Low But Drug Resistance on the Rise</strong></h3>
<p><a href="../Gonorrhea/default.htm">Gonorrhea</a> is the second most commonly reported infectious disease in the United States, with 330,132 cases reported in 2004. From a high of 467.7 cases per 100,000 population reported in 1975, the U.S. gonorrhea rate fell to 113.5
    in 2004 (a 76% decline) &mdash; the lowest recorded level since reporting began
    in 1941. More recently, from 2003 to 2004, the rate fell 1.5 percent (from
    115.2 cases per 100,000 population to 113.5). Like chlamydia, however, gonorrhea
    is substantially under diagnosed and under reported, and approximately twice
    as many new infections are estimated to occur each year as are reported.<sup><a href="#ref1"><strong>1</strong></a></sup>    </p>
<p><img src="images/trends-gon-rates.gif" alt="Gonorrhea Rate, 1941-2004" width="600" height="227" /></p>
<p><strong>Racial Disparities Persist</strong></p>
<p>    African Americans remain the group most heavily affected by gonorrhea. While
      the rate of gonorrhea among blacks fell 3.0 percent from 2003 to 2004,
      the reported 2004 rate per 100,000 population for blacks (629.6) was 19
      times
      greater than for whites (33.3). In 2003, the rate for blacks was 20 times
      higher than the rate for whites.</p>
<p>    American Indians/Alaska Natives had the second-highest gonorrhea rate in
        2004 (117.7, up 14.8% from 2003), followed by Hispanics (71.3, up 2.3%
        from 2003), whites (33.3, up 2.1% from 2003), and Asians/Pacific Islanders
        (21.4,
        down 3.2% from 2003). </p>
<p>    Ethnic minorities in the United States have traditionally had higher
          rates of reported gonorrhea and other STDs, in part a reflection of
      limited access
          to quality health care, poverty, and higher background prevalence of
          disease in these populations. </p>
<p>    <strong>Drug Resistance Increasing In Communities Across the United States</strong></p>
<p>    Drug resistance is an increasingly important concern in the treatment and
      prevention of gonorrhea.<sup><a href="#ref10"><strong>10</strong></a></sup> CDC
      monitors trends in gonorrhea drug resistance through the <a href="../GISP/default.htm">Gonococcal
        Isolate Surveillance Project</a> (GISP), which tests gonorrhea samples
        (&#8220;isolates&#8221;)
        from the first 25 men with urethral gonorrhea attending STD clinics each
        month in sentinel clinics across the United States (28 cities in 2004).<sup><a href="#ref11"><strong>11</strong></a></sup> </p>
<p>    Overall, 6.8 percent of gonorrhea isolates tested through GISP in 2004
          demonstrated resistance to fluoroquinolones, a leading class of antibiotics
          used to treat
          the disease, compared to 4.1 percent in 2003 and 2.2 percent in 2002.
          Resistance is especially worrisome among men who have sex with men
      (MSM), where resistance
          was eight times higher than among heterosexuals (23.8% vs. 2.9%). </p>
<p>    In April 2004, CDC recommended that fluoroquinolones no longer be used
            as treatment for gonorrhea among MSM. Fluoroquinolones are also not
            recommended to treat gonorrhea in anyone in California and Hawaii,
            where fluoroquinolone-resistant
            cases have been widespread for several years. Outside of these states
            in 2004, 17.8 percent of gonorrhea isolates among MSM were resistant
            to fluoroquinolones,
            while resistance among heterosexuals remained low at 1.3 percent.  </p>
<p class="pale-orange"><span class="ruddy"><strong>Health Consequences of Gonorrhea</strong></span><strong><br />
  <br />
</strong>While gonorrhea is easily cured, untreated cases can lead to serious health
        problems. Among women, gonorrhea is a major cause of <a href="../PID/STDFact-PID.htm">PID</a>, which can lead
        to chronic pelvic pain, ectopic pregnancy, and infertility. In men, untreated
        gonorrhea can cause epididymitis, a painful condition of the testicles
        that can result in infertility. In addition, studies suggest that presence
        of
        gonorrhea infection makes an individual three to five times more likely
        to acquire <a href="../HIV/default.htm">HIV</a>, if exposed.<sup><a href="#ref9"><strong>9</strong></a></sup></p>
<h3><strong><a name="trendssyphilis" id="trendssyphilis"></a>Syphilis: Cases Increase for Fourth Consecutive Year</strong></h3>
<p>    The rate of primary and secondary (P&amp;S) <a href="../Syphilis/default.htm">syphilis</a> &mdash; the most infectious
        stages of the disease &mdash; decreased throughout the 1990s, and in 2000 reached
        an all-time low. However, over the past four years the syphilis rate in the
        United States has been increasing. Between 2003 and 2004 alone, the national
        P&amp;S syphilis rate increased 8 percent, from 2.5 to 2.7 cases per 100,000
        population; during this time, reported P&amp;S cases in the United States increased
        from 7,177 to 7,980. </p>
<p>    Overall, increases in P&amp;S syphilis rates between 2000 and 2004 were observed
          only among men. The rate of P&amp;S syphilis among males rose 81 percent between
          2000 and 2004 (from 2.6 to 4.7), and 11.9 percent between 2003 (4.2) and 2004.
          Notably, in 2004 &mdash; for the first time in over 10 years &mdash; the rate
          among females did not decrease, remaining at 0.8. Between 2003 and 2004, the
          rate of congenital syphilis (i.e., transmission from mother to child) decreased
          17.8 percent (from 10.7 to 8.8 per 100,000 live births), likely reflecting
          the substantial reduction in syphilis among women that has occurred over the
          past decade. </p>
<p><img src="images/trends-syph-rates.gif" alt="P&amp;S Syphilis Rates By Sex, 1981-2004" width="590" height="306" /></p>
<p>    <strong>Rising Rate Driven By Cases Among Men</strong></p>
<p>    <img src="images/trends-syph-transmission-ca.gif" alt="Estimated P&amp;S Syphilis Cases, 2004 - Transmission Category" width="270" height="243" align="left" />Increasing cases of <a href="../Syphilis/STDFact-MSM&Syphilis.htm">P&amp;S syphilis among MSM</a> are believed to be largely
      responsible for the overall increases in the national syphilis rate observed
      since 2000. Until very recently, CDC has not collected data by risk group.
      However, the male-to-female ratio for P&amp;S syphilis has risen steadily
      between 2000 and 2004 (from 1.5 to 5.9), suggesting increased syphilis transmission
      among MSM. This increase occurred among all racial and ethnic groups. Additionally,
      CDC estimates that MSM comprised 64 percent of P&amp;S syphilis cases in
      2004, up from 5 percent in 1999.<sup><a href="#ref12"><strong>12</strong></a></sup><br clear="left" />
 </p>
<p><strong>Recent Declines Among African Americans Possibly Reversing</strong></p>
<p>    In 2004, the P&amp;S syphilis rate among blacks increased for the first time
    in more than a decade &mdash; 16.9 percent from 2003 to 2004 (from 7.7 to 9.0),
    with the most significant increases among black men. Between 2003 and 2004,
    the syphilis rate among black males increased 22.6 percent (from 11.5 to 14.1),
    while the rate among black women rose 2.4 percent (from 4.2 to 4.3). In addition,
    the male-to-female ratio for blacks rose from 2.7 in 2003 to 3.3 in 2004, suggesting
    increases among black MSM. </p>
<p>    Racial gaps in syphilis rates are narrowing, with rates in 2004 5.6 times
      higher among blacks than among whites, a substantially lower differential
      than in
      2000, when the rate among blacks was 24 times greater than among whites.
      This narrowing reflects both declining disease rates among African Americans
      and
      the significant increases among white men in recent years. Continued progress
      in <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/stopsyphilis/">eliminating this disease</a> will require an ongoing commitment to syphilis
      education, testing, and treatment in all populations affected.<br />
      <br />
      <strong>Urban Areas Bear Greatest Syphilis Burden</strong></p>
<p>    Syphilis remains a public health problem in metropolitan areas with large
        populations of MSM. For the third consecutive year, San Francisco had
      the highest P&amp;S
        rate of any U.S. city in 2004 (45.9). Other leading cities include Atlanta,
        Georgia (34.6); Baltimore, Maryland (33.2); New Orleans, Louisiana (16.4);
        St Louis, Missouri (14.1); Detroit, Michigan (13.5); Washington, D.C.
      (12.2); Dallas, Texas (11.6); Jersey City, New Jersey (10.8); and Chicago,

  <br />
</strong>Syphilis, a genital ulcerative disease, is highly infectious, but easily
          curable in 
          its early (primary and secondary) stages. If untreated, it can lead
          to serious long-term complications, including nerve, cardiovascular,
          and
          organ damage,
          and even death. Congenital syphilis can cause stillbirth, death soon
          after birth, and physical deformity and neurological complications
          in children
          who survive. Syphilis, like many other STDs, facilitates the spread
          of <a href="../HIV/default.htm">HIV</a>, increasing
          transmission of the virus at least two- to five-fold.<sup><a href="#ref13"><strong>13</strong></a></sup></p>
