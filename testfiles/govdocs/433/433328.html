The September 11th Fund<BR><BR>


Dear President Bush,<BR><BR>

I was amazed and dismayed at the decision of Kenneth Feinberg relating to how 
he intends to recommend the administration of funds for the victims of the 
disaster that befell this country six months ago today.   I gather, from some 
news accounts I've read, that he intends to "follow state law" in terms of 
recognizing gay and lesbian relationships when deciding whether or not to 
grant relief to those families.<BR><BR>  

Mr. President, he knows, you know and I know that the State laws to which he 
refers nearly unanimously declare those relationships void and  valueless 
and, consequently, he's permitting (hoping for?) them to be his 'cover' for 
not granting benefit to these victims.<BR><BR>

President Bush, you and I were once distant colleagues - you on the Board of 
Directors of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

 and me as its Chief Financial 
Officer of the Southern Division in 1992 to 1995.  At that time, I trusted 
your judgment as a member of our Board of Directors and I hope that I can 
trust your judgment again today to overturn Mr. Feinberg's decision.<BR><BR>

Its just plain wrong and I'm sure you know that.  Please confirm back to me 
that you intend to do just that.  I'd appreciate that. <BR><BR> 

Geez, the timing couldn't be worse - Katie Couric (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) 
just had &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mother on the Today Show this morning.  She reported 
on what a hero &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; was unsuspecting, I'm certain, that this news would break 
about such a miscarriage of justice.<BR><BR>

You need to act, Mr. President.<BR><BR>

Respectfully submitted,<BR><BR>


Atlanta, Georgia
