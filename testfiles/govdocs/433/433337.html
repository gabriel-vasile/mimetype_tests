Defendant-Appellant,<br>                            _____________________<br><br>            Lloyd Haggert,  appeals the sentence imposed  by the district<br><br>            court   following   his   conviction   for   bank   fraud.   <br><br>            Specifically,  Haggert challenges the court's imposition of a<br><br>            five-level increase  from his  base offense under  Sentencing<br><br>            Guideline    2F1.1, which mandates such  an increase when the<br><br>            "loss" attendant to fraud is "more than $40,000."  U.S.S.G.  <br><br>            2F1.1(b)(1)(F) (Nov. 1991).  The district court looked to the<br><br>            amount of  loss that Haggert intended  to obtain fraudulently<br><br>            from the bank, in assessing loss at $62,508.50, the sum total<br><br>            of Haggert's  fraudulent sight drafts.   Haggert asserts that<br><br>            the  court  ought  instead  to  have  used  the  actual  loss<br><br>            resulting  from his  criminal  conduct, which  the court  had<br><br>            determined was $5,511.30.  We  affirm the sentence imposed by<br><br>            the district court.<br><br>                                         I.  <br>                                         I.<br><br>                                     Background  <br>                                     Background<br>                                     __________<br><br>                    Lloyd Haggert was convicted  by a jury in the  United<br><br>            States District Court for the District  of Maine of violating<br><br>            Title 18  U.S.C.   1344, by  defrauding the federally-insured<br><br>            Skowhegan  Savings  Bank.     The  act  underlying  Haggert's<br><br>            conviction  was his  attempt  to pay  delinquent real  estate<br><br>            mortgages  with valueless  sight drafts.   On  May 30,  1989,<br><br>            Haggert presented two sight drafts, totalling $62,508.50,  to<br><br>            the  assistant manager of the  Skowhegan Savings Bank who, at<br><br><br><br>                                         -2-<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>            that time, believed them  to be cashier's checks  and stamped<br><br>            them  as paid.  The  bank later discovered  that these drafts<br><br>            lacked   a   financial  institution   identification  number.<br><br>            Further investigation revealed that the financial institution<br><br>            upon which  they were drawn  was not a  legitimate, operating<br><br>            institution.<br><br>                    When the Skowhegan Savings  Bank refused to discharge<br><br>            Haggert's mortgages, Haggert  obtained a judgment to  enforce<br><br>            the  sight  drafts.1    The  bank  eventually  foreclosed  on<br><br>            Haggert's mortgages.  After  accounting for the proceeds from<br><br>            foreclosure,  the bank  suffered a  loss  of $20,248.10.   In<br><br>            addition, the  bank incurred  costs of $5,511.30,  in fending<br><br>            off  Haggert's  attempts  to  force  the  bank  to  honor the<br><br>            fraudulent sight drafts.    <br><br>                    Prior  to  his sentencing,  Haggert responded  to the<br><br>            pre-sentence report  prepared  by the  government.    Haggert<br><br>            objected to  the determination of the  amount of restitution,<br><br>            which had been set  at $25,759.40, to reflect the  total loss<br><br>            to  the  bank in  its dealings  with  Haggert.   In addition,<br><br>            Haggert  challenged  two  factual  assertions  that  are  not<br><br>            pertinent  to the issue before  us.  Haggert  made no further<br><br>            objections  either at  the pre-sentence  stage or  during the<br><br>            sentencing  hearing.   In fact,  the district  judge directly<br><br><br>                                <br>            ____________________<br><br>            1  It would appear  that the defendant  obtained the judgment<br>            himself, without going through any judicial procedures.<br><br>                                         -3-<br>                                          3<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>            asked Haggert  whether he  had any additional  objections, at<br><br>            the beginning of  the sentencing hearing, and whether  he had<br><br>            anything to add, near the end of the hearing.  <br><br>                    The district court determined  that the amount of the<br><br>            defendant's  fraud was  $62,508.50, and  added  the mandatory<br><br>            five-level  increase  for  loss   of  more  than  $40,000  to<br><br>            Haggert's   sentence.  For   the   purpose   of   calculating<br><br>            restitution,  the  court determined  that  the  bank's actual<br><br>            damages were  limited by statute to the loss directly related<br><br>            to the criminal conduct  of the defendant and  thus exclusive<br><br>            of  the bank's  foreclosure  costs.   See  18 U.S.C.     3664<br>                                                  ___<br><br>            (1988).  The court established  that the actual damage caused<br><br>            by  the defendant's fraud was $5,511.30, the cost to the bank<br><br>            of Haggert's attempts to enforce the fraudulent sight drafts.<br><br>            Haggert  was sentenced to a term of fifteen months in prison,<br><br>            followed by a  two-year term of  supervised release, and  was<br><br>            ordered  to pay  $5,511.30  in restitution  to the  Skowhegan<br><br>            Savings Bank. <br><br>                                         II. <br>                                         II.<br><br>                                      Discussion<br>                                      Discussion<br>                                      __________<br><br>            A.

The  pre-sentence  report<br><br>            assessed  the amount  of fraud  as $62,508.50,  and expressly<br><br><br><br>                                         -5-<br>                                          5<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>            recommended the five-level increase eventually adopted by the<br><br>            district court.   In  his memorandum responding  to the  pre-<br><br>            sentence report,  Haggert offered three  objections, none  of<br><br>            which concerned either the calculation of the amount of fraud<br><br>            or the five-level increase.   Moreover, during the sentencing<br><br>            hearing,  the  district  court  judge took  care  to  inquire<br><br>            whether  Haggert  had  further objections  or  comments,  and<br><br>            Haggert voiced no additional concerns.

The Sentencing Guidelines<br>                _________________________<br><br>                    The issue raised  on appeal is the  meaning of "loss"<br><br>            in  the Sentencing  Guideline covering  fraud.   The district<br><br>            court measured loss by the amount that the defendant intended<br>                                                                 ________<br><br>            to obtain fraudulently from the bank.

We<br><br>            begin with an examination of the Sentencing Guidelines.<br><br>                    Guideline   2F1.1 covers  crimes involving fraud  and<br><br>            deceit.  That Guideline  begins with a base offense  level of<br><br>            six, which  level is adjusted  upward in accordance  with the<br><br>            dollar  value of  the loss  involved in  the crime.

The<br>            Commentary  in    2B1.1, in  turn, refers  for  discussion of<br>            partially   completed   offenses   to       2X1.1   (Attempt,<br>            Solicitation,  or Conspiracy).    The example  provided in   <br>            2B1.1 of  a partially completed offense is  a completed theft<br>            that is part of a  larger, attempted theft.  This example  is<br>            closely analogous to the case at hand where the defendant was<br>            not  successful in  reaping  the anticipated  profits of  his<br>            fraud.   See generally, United States  v. Schneider, 930 F.2d<br>                     ___ _________  _____________     _________<br>            555,  556  (7th  Cir.  1991)("Many  fraudulent   schemes  are<br>            interrupted  before they  reach fruition.

The example provides  that, "if the fraud consisted<br><br>            in . .  . representing that  a forged check  for $40,000  was<br><br>            genuine,  the loss  would  be $40,000."    U.S.S.G.    2F1.1,<br><br>            comment.  (n.7).   The fraudulent  sight drafts  that Haggert<br><br>            presented to  the bank  as genuine  totalled $62,508.50.   By<br><br>            analogy  to this example,  the loss would  be $62,508.50, the<br><br>            assessment made by the district court.<br><br>                    Notwithstanding the general rule whereby loss for the<br><br>            purpose of  sentencing  is  the  greater  of  the  actual  or<br><br>            intended losses, Haggert  urges us  to apply to  his case  an<br><br>            exception narrowly created for  loan application and contract<br><br>            procurement cases.  The exception, articulated in subpart (a)<br><br>            of  Application  Note 7,  defines  a  category of  fraudulent<br><br>            actions for which the  expected or actual loss to  the victim<br><br>            provides the basis for the sentence enhancement.  Application<br><br>            Note 7(a), in pertinent part, provides as follows: <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>                                         -9-<br>                                          9<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>                         In fraudulent loan application cases and<br>                    contract   procurement    cases   where   the<br>                    defendant's  capabilities   are  fraudulently<br>                    represented, the  loss is the actual  loss to<br>                    the victim (or  if the loss has  not yet come<br>                    about, the expected loss).  For example, if a<br>                    defendant  fraudulently  obtains  a  loan  by<br>                    misrepresenting the value  of his assets, the<br>                    loss is the amount of  the loan not repaid at<br>                    the time the  offense is discovered,  reduced<br>                    by  the amount  the  lending institution  has<br>                    recovered, or can expect to recover, from any<br>                    assets pledged to secure the loan.<br>                         In some cases, the loss determined above<br>                    may significantly understate or overstate the<br>                    seriousness of  the defendant's conduct . . .<br>                    .<br><br>            U.S.S.G.    2F1.1,  comment. (n.7(a)).   We  fail to  see the<br><br>            relevance of this exception  for the factually distinct crime<br><br>            of fraudulent loan  payments made well after  loans have been<br><br>            secured.    Nevertheless,  we   examine  the  scope  of  this<br><br>            exception  in   order  to  underscore  our   conclusion  that<br><br>            Haggert's  fraud is  precisely the  sort of  criminal conduct<br><br>            that the exception does not cover.    <br><br>                    The Seventh  Circuit has  explained the scope  of the<br><br>            exception for fraudulent information in a loan application or<br><br>            in contract procurement by  distinguishing between two  types<br><br>            of  fraud.

In the latter case, and only<br>                                        __<br><br>            in the latter case, is the intended loss not to be considered<br><br>            for sentencing.<br><br>                    Contrary to Haggert's attempt to place himself in the<br><br>            latter category of offenders, Haggert's conduct is a paradigm<br><br>            of the  first type  of fraud.   Haggert had  no intention  of<br><br>            paying the loans  for which  he was in  default.  He  drafted<br><br>            valueless  forms of payment which he presented to the bank as<br><br>            valid.  When  he succeeded momentarily  in his ploy,  Haggert<br><br>            went so far  as to attempt to enforce a  judgment against the<br><br>            bank for the amount of his fraudulent sight drafts.  When the<br><br>            bank had  difficulty locating the financial  institution upon<br><br>            which the  fraudulent drafts  were drawn, Haggert  evaded the<br><br>            bank's requests for his assistance, and obstructed the bank's<br><br>            attempts to determine the facts, by continuing to insist upon<br><br>            the  veracity  of  the  information  he  provided  the  bank.<br><br>            Finally,  Haggert knowingly  presented the sight  drafts that<br><br>            had  been  falsely stamped  as "paid"   to  another financial<br><br>            institution to support  new loan applications.  Any  of these<br><br>            actions alone would suffice  to establish Haggert's intention<br><br>            not to  pay the  debts he  owed to  the bank;  together, they<br><br><br>                                <br>            ____________________<br><br>            3 See generally, United States v.
