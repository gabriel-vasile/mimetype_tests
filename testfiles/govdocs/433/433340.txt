MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING

Between the
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development

and Rural Development of the
U.S. Department of Agriculture


PURPOSE

This Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) establishes the framework for a continuing working relationship between the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and Rural Development of the U.S. Department of Agriculture to develop jointly and to implement inter-agency efforts cooperatively in providing housing assistance to low-income households in Rural America.


SITUATION

The Department of Housing and Urban Development administers a variety of housing assistance programs that serve rural families and individuals as well as those living in non-rural communities.  These programs are under various authorities, including the National Housing Act (1934), the Housing Act of 1937, the Housing Act of 1949, and the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, all as amended.

Rural Development, an Agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, administers programs to improve housing conditions specifically in rural areas for very low, low-, and moderate-income families and individuals.  Financial assistance is available to eligible organizations, including public and private nonprofit entities, and to households.  The housing programs are authorized by the Housing Act of 1949, as amended.


AGREEMENT

As detailed in the attached Exhibits, it is mutually agreed that HUD and Rural Development will maintain an on-going working relationship among its respective staffs to address a variety of mutual issues in providing housing assistance to Rural America in a cooperative, cost effective, and non-duplicative manner.

It is the intent of both parties to have this MOU represent current and critical areas of concern for both Agencies.  Therefore, it is further agreed that, on the anniversary date of this Agreement, HUD and Rural Development will review the attached Exhibits, adding new issues to be addressed, modifying existing Exhibits on continuing issues if necessary, and deleting Exhibits on accomplished activities.

HUD – RURAL DEVELOPMENT MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING

EXHIBIT K

							DATE:  October 16, 1991

I.   Issue:

Rural Development Single Family Housing (SFH) inventory properties used in the HUD HOPE 3 program.

II.  Objective of Coordinated Activities:

Rural Development acquires SFH properties in inventory as a result of its loan program.  Inventory properties suitable for Rural Development program applicants are repaired and sold, preferably to program applicants on program terms. Nonprogram properties are broom cleaned and sold for cash or on nonprogram terms.

HUD, through the HOPE 3 program, provides homeownership opportunities for low income families and individuals (Participants) by providing grantees (Grantees) with Federal assistance to initially acquire and rehabilitate government owned properties from government agencies and sell them to Participants at affordable prices, after making needed repairs.  Alternatively, Grantees can facilitate direct acquisition and repair of housing by Participants by providing financing, funds for down payments, repairs and/or subsidized interest rates.

Rural Development and HUD cooperate and coordinate the use of Rural Development inventory properties for the benefit of Participants.

III. Tasks Proposed to Accomplish Objectives:

1.  Upon request, Rural Development will provide to Grantees lists of all SFH properties in inventory in the areas of interest.

2.  Grantees may submit to Rural Development, for themselves or a Participant, a written offer for a property to be closed within 30 days.

3.  Whether or not the property was listed for sale, Rural Development may sell and will give preference to offers from Grantees and Participants for inventory sales.  If Rural Development contracts for repairs have not been awarded, repairs will not be made, except for decent, safe and sanitary (DSS) requirements.

4.  If Rural Development has listed the property for sale, the listing will be withdrawn when the written offer from a

Participant or Grantee is received by Rural Development.  Rural Development will not pay a sales commission for properties sold to Participants or Grantees.

5.  Rural Development will repair NP properties not meeting Rural Development DSS requirements to remove the decent, safe and sanitary problem(s) if the value of the property increases more than the cost of repairs.  Otherwise, Rural Development will sell NP properties with the DSS clause.  Grantees are responsible for meeting DSS conditions and having the DSS clause removed from the deed before Participants occupy the dwelling.

6.  Rural Development will sell properties to Grantees or Participants with a 10 percent price discount from current market value or the listed price, which ever is less.

7.  Rural Development may sell program properties to Grantees or Participants with Rural Development program financing or for cash.  Rural Development may sell nonprogram properties to Grantees or Participants with Rural Development nonprogram financing or for cash.  The buyer must meet all other Rural Development eligibility requirements.

8.  Rural Development will close the sale within 30 days.  If Grantee or Participant cannot close within 30 days, Rural Development will reject the offer.

IV.  Projected Timetable:

           Task                            	Completion Date
