I have recently observed that the SEC is considering updating the rules 
governing how shareholders can vote their ballots at corporate annual meetings.  
Having invested mine and my wife’s retirement savings into mutual funds and 
having further invested in numerous stocks over the years, some of which have 
dwindled to nearly valueless positions because of company mismanagement, 
corporate fraud and excesses, I appreciate any improvements the SEC can make 
which will permit shareholders greater ability to participate in overseeing 
the management of the companies they own.

 

Very truly yours
