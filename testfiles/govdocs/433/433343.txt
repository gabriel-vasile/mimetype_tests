 ORDER  ON  RECONSIDERATION 
 Adopted:  August  4,  2006  Released:  August  7,  2006 


 By  the  Chief,  Public  Safety  and  Critical  Infrastructure  Division,  Wireless  Telecommunications  Bureau: 
 1.  Introduction.  We  have  before  us  a  petition  for  reconsideration  filed  by  National  Science  and  Technology  Network,  Inc.  (NSTN),  on  July  2,  2003.  1  NSTN  seeks  reconsideration  of  an  order  of  the 
 Wireless  Telecommunications  Bureau’s  former  Public  Safety  and  Private  Wireless  Division  (Division)  2  that  modified  NSTN’s  license  for  Station  WPMJ456,  Glendale,  California.  3  Specifically,  the  Division 


 1  Petition  for  Reconsideration  of  FCC  Order  of  Modification  Released  June  4,  2003,  filed  July  2,  2003  (NSTN 
 Petition).  2 
 The  Commission  reorganized  the  Wireless  Telecommunications  Bureau  effective  November  13,  2003,  and  the  relevant  duties  of  the  Public  Safety  and  Private  Wireless  Division  were  assumed  by  the  Public  Safety  and  Critical 


 Infrastructure  Division.  See  Reorganization  of  the  Wireless  Telecommunications  Bureau,  Order,  18  FCC  Rcd  25414,  25414  ¶  2  (2003). 
 3  National  Science  and  Technology  Network,  Inc.  Order  of  Modification,  18  FCC  Rcd  11321  (WTB  PSPWD  2003) 
 (Order  of  Modification).

 modified  the  license  by  altering  its  station  class  code  from  FB8  (centralized  trunked)  4  to  FB6  (decentralized  trunked).  5  This  action  was  taken  pursuant  to  an  earlier  order  proposing  to  modify  NSTN’s 
 license,  and  affording  NSTN  an  opportunity  to  object  to  the  proposed  modification.  6  In  its  petition  for  reconsideration,  NSTN  contends  that  the  Division  improperly  failed  to  hold  a  formal  evidentiary  hearing 
 and  that  the  procedures  followed  by  the  Division  amounted  to  an  abuse  of  discretion  and  a  denial  of  due  process.  For  the  reasons  stated  below,  we  conclude  that  the  Division  acted  in  a  procedurally  correct 
 manner,  and  accordingly  deny  NSTN’s  petition  for  reconsideration. 
 2.  Background.  7  In  1997,  the  Commission  decided  to  permit  centralized  trunking  in  the  private  land  mobile  radio  (PLMR)  bands  between  150  MHz  and  512  MHz.  8  The  Commission  emphasized  that 


 centralized  trunking  would  be  permitted  only  in  those  areas  where  exclusivity  is  recognized  by  the  Commission  or  where  an  applicant/  licensee  has  obtained  the  consent  of  all  licensees  whose  service  areas 
 overlap  a  circle  with  a  radius  of  seventy  miles  from  the  proposed  trunked  system’s  base  station.  9 
 3.  The  instant  matter  originated  on  May  14,  1998,  when  the  American  Automobile  Association  (AAA),  an  FCC-  certified  frequency  coordinator  for  PLMR  spectrum,  filed  an  application  on  behalf  of 


 NSTN  to  operate  in  the  centralized  trunked  mode  in  the  450  MHz  band.  10  NSTN  received  an  authorization  to  operate  centralized  trunked  Industrial/  Business  Station  WPMJ456  on  August  12,  1998. 
 Approximately  three  months  later,  on  November  5,  1998,  the  Industrial  Telecommunications  Association,  Inc.  (ITA),  another  FCC-  certified  PLMR  frequency  coordinator,  filed  an  application  on  behalf  of  Fisher 
 Wireless  Services,  Inc.  (Fisher),  requesting  authorization  for  Fisher  to  operate  in  the  decentralized  trunked  mode  in  the  450  MHz  band.  11  In  November  1998,  NSTN  filed  an  “informal  petition”  in  which  it 
 requested  the  deletion  of  frequency  pairs  452.3000/  457.3000  MHz  and  452.6500/  457.  6500  MHz  from  Fisher’s  application  due  to  the  close  proximity  of  NSTN’s  use  of  the  same  frequencies  in  its  operation  of 
 Station  WPMJ456.  12 
 4.  In  response  to  an  FCC  request  to  examine  the  frequency  coordination  and  procedural  issues  surrounding  the  Fisher  application,  ITA  submitted  a  frequency  analysis  demonstrating  that  on  virtually 


 every  frequency  at  each  of  the  four  base  station  sites  authorized  for  Station  WPMJ456,  there  were 
 4  In  a  “centralized  trunked  system,”  the  base  station  controller  provides  dynamic  channel  assignments  automatically 
 searching  all  channels  in  the  system  for,  and  assigning  to  a  user,  an  open  channel  within  that  system.  5 
 In  a  “decentralized  trunked  system,”  which  is  also  a  system  of  dynamic  channel  assignment,  the  system  continually  monitors  the  assigned  channels  for  activity  both  within  the  trunked  system  and  outside  the  trunked  system,  and 


 transmits  only  when  an  open  channel  is  found.  6

 7  The  background  of  this  matter  is  set  forth  at  greater  length  in  the  Order  of  Modification.

 9  Id.  In  1999,  the  Commission  provided  applicants  with  an  alternate  means  of  obtaining  an  authorization  for  a 
 centralized  trunked  system  by  obtaining  the  concurrence  of  any  existing  co-  channel  or  adjacent  channel  licensee  whose  39  dBu  service  contour  (UHF)  or  37  dBu  service  contour  (VHF)  is  intersected  by  the  21  dBu  (UHF)  or  19 


 dBu  (VHF)  interference  contour  of  a  proposed  trunked  station.  See  Replacement  of  Part  90  by  Part  88  to  Revise  the  Private  Land  Mobile  Radio  Services  and  Modify  the  Policies  Governing  Them,  Third  Memorandum  Opinion  and

 multiple  incumbent  co-  channel  or  adjacent  channel  licensees  located  within  seventy  miles  of  NSTN’s  base  stations.  13  As  a  result,  ITA  opined  that  Station  WPMJ456  should  never  have  received  a  “YG” 
 (trunked)  license.  14  On  February  10,  2000,  Mobile  Relay  Associates  (MRA),  licensee  of  several  PLMR  stations  located  in  the  Los  Angeles,  California  area,  filed  a  letter  in  support  of  ITA’s  suggestion  to  modify 
 the  license  for  Station  WPMJ456,  stating  that  NSTN’s  license  had  been  obtained  through  an  “improper,  defective  coordination,”  15  as  MRA  had  three  co-  channel  applications  pending  before  the  Commission  at 
 the  time  NSTN’s  application  was  coordinated  by  AAA.  16 
 5.  On  June  26,  2000,  the  Division’s  Licensing  and  Technical  Analysis  Branch  (Branch  or  LTAB)  requested  that  AAA  demonstrate  the  sufficiency  of  the  frequency  coordination  conducted  for  Station 


 WPMJ456.  17  The  Branch  noted  that  although  AAA  indicated  that  it  does  not  maintain  frequency  coordination  records,  18  Section  90.187(  b)(  2)(  v)  of  the  Commission’s  Rules  19  requires  trunked  licensees  to 
 maintain  letters  of  consent  and  to  provide  copies  to  the  FCC  upon  request.  20  LTAB  further  noted  that  if  AAA’s  coordination  of  Station  WPMJ456  was  not  proven  to  be  valid,  LTAB  would  “institute  a  license 
 modification  proceeding.”  21  On  July  21,  2000,  AAA  responded  not  by  supplying  the  requested  information,  but  by  taking  the  position  that  it  was  “unreasonable”  to  ask  it  to  recreate  the  “state  of  affairs” 
 that  existed  in  1997  or  1998.  22  On  January  22,  2001,  NSTN  submitted  to  the  Branch  a  letter  challenging  ITA’s  standing  to  contest  NSTN’s  license  for  Station  WPMJ456,  and  asserting  that  the  license  could  not 
 be  revoked  “absent  a  full  trial  before  an  administrative  law  judge.”  23 
 6.  On  January  26,  2001,  NSTN  filed  an  informal  petition  requesting  that  the  Commission  cancel  the  licenses  of  eight  stations  licensed  to  MRA  for  “causing  harmful  co-  channel  interference  to  the  users  of 


 [NSTN’s]  FB-  8  [sic]  YG  trunked  stations.”  24  The  Branch  dismissed  that  petition  on  April  6,  2001.  25  On  July  29,  2002,  NSTN  filed  a  petition  for  reconsideration  of  the  Branch’s  dismissal.

 7.  On  August  9,  2002,  the  Division  proposed  to  modify  NSTN’s  license  for  Station  WPMJ456  by  changing  its  station  class  code  from  a  centralized  trunked  station  (station  class  FB8)  to  a  decentralized 
 trunked  station  (station  class  FB6).  26  The  Division  concluded  that  the  original  NSTN  application  should  not  have  been  coordinated  or  granted  because  it  did  not  provide  the  requisite  interference  protection  to 
 several  existing  stations  and  pending  applications,  and  there  was  no  record  that  any  of  the  required  consents  were  obtained.  27 


 8.  On  September  9,  2002,  NSTN  filed  a  petition  protesting  the  proposed  license  modification.  28  In  its  protest,  NSTN  made  two  arguments  why  the  license  for  Station  WPMJ456  should  not  be  modified.  29 
 First,  NSTN  claimed  that  the  frequency  coordination  performed  for  the  Fisher  application  was  “improper  due  to  the  congestion  of  the  relevant  frequencies.”  30  Second,  NSTN  pointed  to  its  reliance  on  the 
 Commission’s  grant  of  its  license  and  stated  that  it  would  “suffer  grievous  injury  as  a  result  of  any  change  in  status  of  the  license.”  31  The  Division  rejected  both  arguments.  32  Consequently,  the  Division  modified 
 NSTN’s  license  for  Station  WPMJ456  by  altering  its  station  class  code  from  FB8  to  FB6.  In  addition,  the  Division  dismissed  as  moot  NSTN’s  petition  for  reconsideration  of  the  Branch’s  dismissal  of  NSTN’s 
 informal  petition  requesting  that  the  Commission  cancel  MRA’s  licenses,  because  the  petition  was  premised  on  Station  WPMJ456  having  FB8  status.  33  On  July  2,  2003,  NSTN  filed  the  instant  petition  for 
 reconsideration  of  the  Division’s  decision.  34 
 9.  Discussion.  NSTN  states  that  the  modification  of  its  license  changing  the  station  class  from  FB8  to  FB6  is  the  equivalent  of  a  license  revocation,  because  it  rendered  the  license  economically  valueless. 


 NSTN  therefore  argues  that  it  was  entitled  to  a  formal  hearing  prior  to  such  action,  pursuant  to  Section  312  of  the  Communications  Act  of  1934,  as  amended  (the  Act).  35  It  also  argues  that  the  Division  was 
 prohibited  from  taking  any  action  with  respect  to  the  license  once  the  grant  became  final.  As  set  forth  below,  we  find  these  arguments  unpersuasive. 


 (...  continued  from  previous  page)  25  See  Letter  dated  Apr.  6,  2001  from  Mary  Shultz,  Chief,  Licensing  and  Technical  Analysis  Branch,  Public  Safety 
 and  Private  Wireless  Division,  Wireless  Telecommunications  Bureau,  Federal  Communications  Commission  to  Alan  M.  Lurya.

 32  With  respect  to  the  first  argument,  the  Division  concluded  that  NSTN  had  not  provided  any  legal  or  technical 
 support  for  its  contention  that  the  frequencies  were  fully  occupied;  and,  even  if  the  frequencies  were  fully  occupied,  the  argument  failed  to  address  the  Division’s  conclusion  that  NSTN’s  application  was  improperly  granted.  Order  of 


 Modification,  18  FCC  Rcd  at  11325-  26  ¶  12.  With  respect  to  the  second  argument,  the  Division  concluded  that  the  effect  of  the  proposed  modification  on  NSTN  did  not  outweigh  the  benefits,  because  it  would  be  more  equitable  to 
 modify  NSTN’s  license  than  it  would  be  to  completely  bar  Fisher  and  MRA  from  operating  on  the  subject  frequencies.  Id.  at  11326  ¶  13.  In  any  event,  we  note  that  NSTN  failed  to  explain  and  document  how  it  would  be 
 injured.  33

 10.  First,  NSTN  contends,  “The  modification  .  .  .  is  actually  the  economic  equivalent  of  revocation.  The  Order  destroys  an  FB8  license  which  has  substantial  economic  value,  as  it  is  an  exclusive  license,  and 
 puts  in  its  place  a  valueless  FB6  license,  which  is  economically  worthless  because  it  enjoys  no  effective  protection  from  harmful  co-  channel  interference.”  36  We  disagree.  License  modification  is  not  the 
 equivalent  of  license  revocation,  even  if  the  modification  reduces  the  station’s  utility  in  the  licensee’s  perspective.  37  NSTN  is  still  authorized  to  operate  Station  WPMJ456.  The  imposition  of  a  monitoring 
 requirement  neither  revokes  the  license  nor  renders  it  valueless.  38  Thus,  a  Section  312  revocation  hearing  was  not  required  under  the  circumstances  presented. 


 11.  Rather,  this  matter  is  governed  by  Section  316  of  the  Act.  39  Section  316,  as  implemented  by  Section  1.87  of  the  Commission’s  Rules,  40  provides  that  the  Commission  may  modify  a  license  to 
 promote  the  public  interest,  convenience,  and  necessity,  but  no  such  order  of  modification  will  become  final  until  the  licensee  is  provided  an  opportunity  to  protest  the  proposed  modification.  41  It  also  provides 
 that,  if  a  hearing  is  conducted,  the  burden  of  proof  shall  be  upon  the  Commission.  42  Contrary  to  NSTN’s  assertions,  43  Section  316  does  not  provide  for  an  automatic  right  to  a  formal  hearing  prior  to  license 
 modification.  44  Rather,  to  warrant  an  evidentiary  hearing,  the  licensee’s  protest  “must  .  .  .  set  forth  a  substantial  and  material  question  of  fact,”  45  i.  e.,  specific  allegations  of  fact  sufficient  to  show  that  the 
 action  would  be  prima  facie  inconsistent  with  the  public  interest,  convenience  and  necessity.  46  Only  if  this  prima  facie  case  is  made  must  the  Commission  proceed  to  the  second  level  of  inquiry  and  determine 
 whether  the  totality  of  the  evidence  arouses  sufficient  doubt  that  further  inquiry  to  determine  the  facts  is  necessary.  47 


 12.  As  noted  above,  the  Division  concluded  in  the  order  proposing  modification  that  NSTN’s  application  for  Station  WPMJ456  should  not  have  been  granted  because  it  did  not  provide  the  requisite 
 interference  protection  to  existing  stations  and  pending  applications.  NSTN  had  the  same  opportunity,  as

 (concluding  that  modifying  a  license  by  reducing  the  base  transmitter  power  did  not  constitute  a  revocation);  see  also  Review  of  Spectrum  Sharing  Plan  among  Non-  Geostationary  Satellite  Orbit  Mobile  Satellite  Service  Systems

 Big  LEO  channel  plan  constituted  a  revocation  rather  than  a  modification).  38 
 Indeed,  a  review  of  the  Commission’s  Universal  Licensing  System  database  indicates  that  forty-  seven  of  NSTN’s  sixty-  four  other  licenses  (excluding  Station  WPMJ456)  for  base  station  operations  list  frequencies  authorized  on  an 


 FB6  basis.  Thus,  it  appears  that  NSTN  does  in  fact  place  some  value  on  an  FB6  license.  39

 AAA  had  previously,  to  explain  how  the  application  complied  with  the  Commission's  rules,  but  NSTN’s  protest  did  not  raise  any  question  of  fact  concerning  whether  NSTN  obtained  the  requisite  concurrences 
 or  otherwise  provided  the  required  interference  protection.  Rather,  NSTN  argued  that  changing  the  class  of  its  station  would  not  be  in  the  public  interest  because:  (1)  the  Bureau  had  not  resolved  another 
 reconsideration  proceeding  where  the  matter  of  overlapping  licenses  was  at  issue;  and  (2)  the  modification  would  cause  severe  hardship  to  users  of  NSTN's  system.  In  the  Order  of  Modification,  the 
 Division  addressed  the  arguments  NSTN  did  raise  and  found  that  the  proposal  raised  no  significant  issues  of  fact.  It  further  found  that  a  formal  hearing  was  not  warranted  to  address  NSTN's  issues.  48 


 13.  Again,  in  its  instant  petition  for  reconsideration,  NSTN  fails  to  present  any  specific  allegations  of  fact  different  from  those  relied  on  by  the  Division  in  reaching  its  decision.  Moreover,  NSTN  has  not 
 presented  any  evidence  that  a  factual  issue  exists  that  might  warrant  a  formal  hearing  or  an  affidavit  49  in  support  of  the  facts  it  does  allege.  50  As  courts  have  held,  the  standard  for  making  out  a  prima  facie  case 
 "in  effect  says  that  the  Commission  must  look  into  the  possible  existence  of  a  fire  only  when  it  is  shown  a  good  deal  of  smoke."  51  In  this  case,  NSTN  provides  no  allegations  or  evidence  of  any  factual  "smoke"  in 
 the  modification  proceeding. 
 14.  Finally,  NSTN  argues  that  the  Division’s  action  was  untimely,  because  “NSTN’s  FB8  license  became  incontestable  thirty  days  from  date  of  grant,  except  by  the  institution  of  formal  revocation 


 proceedings.”  52  This  is  incorrect.  Relevant  authority  clearly  establishes  that  the  Commission's  authority  to  modify  licenses  under  Section  316  is  not  limited  in  time  or  to  the  correction  of  post-  licensing  events.  53 


 15.  ACCORDINGLY,  IT  IS  ORDERED,  pursuant  to  Sections  4(  i),  316,  and  405  of  the  Communications  Act  of  1934,  as  amended,  47  U.  S.  C.  §§  154(  i),  316,  and  405,  and  Sections  1.87  and 
 1.106  of  the  Commission’s  Rules,  47  C.  F.  R.  §§  1.87  and  1.106,  that  the  Petition  for  Reconsideration  filed  by  the  National  Science  and  Technology  Network,  Inc.  on  July  2,  2003,  IS  DENIED. 


 48  In  addition,  we  note  that  NSTN  did  not  request  a  hearing  in  the  protest  it  submitted  to  the  Division,  and  thus  may 
 be  deemed  to  have  waived  any  right  to  a  hearing.  See  47  C.  F.  R.  §  1.87(  h).  As  noted  above,  although  NSTN  asserted  to  the  Branch  that  its  license  could  not  be  revoked  without  a  hearing,  that  claim  was  irrelevant  because,  as 


 explained,  supra,  NSTN’s  license  was  not  revoked.  49 
 Under  Section  316(  a)(  3),  protests  shall  contain  specific  allegations  of  fact  supported  by  affidavit  of  a  person  or  persons  with  personal  knowledge  thereof,  except  for  facts  of  which  official  notice  may  be  taken.  See  47  U.  S.  C. 


 §  316(  a)(  3);  47  C.  F.  R.  §  1.87(  d).  50 
 In  its  reply  to  MRA’s  opposition  to  its  petition  for  reconsideration,  NSTN  appears  to  contest  the  Division’s  conclusion  that  modifying  the  license  for  Station  WPMJ456  would  serve  the  public  interest.  It  states,  “This  decision 


 puts  the  health  and  safety  of  the  public  at  risk.  Many  of  NSTN’s  customers  are  engaged  in  emergency  response  activities,  which  directly  affect  public  health  and  safety.  For  example,  there  are  several  paramedic  ambulance 
 companies  who  are  users  of  the  system.”  Reply  at  4.  This  is  not  sufficient  to  raise  a  factual  issue  based  on  the  record  thus  far  established  in  this  proceeding.  NSTN  does  not  quantify  the  number  of  emergency  responders  using 
 its  system,  or  explain  how  the  use  of  decentralized  trunking  instead  of  centralized  trunking  would  impair  their  operations,  or  compare  the  composition  of  its  users  with  that  of  MRA’s  and  Fisher’s  users.

 “section  316  ‘contains  no  limitation  on  the  time  frame  within  which  [the  Commission]  may  act  to  modify  a  license’  and  that  its  action  under  the  section  ‘is  not  subject  to  the  limitations  on  revocation,  modification  or  reconsideration
