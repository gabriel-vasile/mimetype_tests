    ascertained, the entirety of the deceased resident's domiciliary
    estate and the entirety of any ancillary estate that is unclaimed
    at the end of the three-year period beginning on the date of the
    death of the resident shall escheat to the Retirement Home.
      (B) Upon the sale of any such unclaimed estate property, the
    proceeds of the sale shall be deposited in the Armed Forces
    Retirement Home Trust Fund.
      (C) If a personal representative or other fiduciary is appointed
    to administer a deceased resident's estate and the administration
    is completed before the end of such three-year period, the balance
    of the entire net proceeds of the estate, less expenses, shall be
    deposited directly in the Armed Forces Retirement Home Trust Fund.
    The heirs or legatees of the deceased resident may file a claim
    made with the Secretary of Defense to reclaim such proceeds. A
    determination of the claim by the Secretary shall be subject to
    judicial review exclusively by the United States Court of Federal
    Claims.
      (2)(A) The Director of a facility of the Retirement Home may
    designate an attorney who is a full-time officer or employee of the
    United States or a member of the Armed Forces on active duty to
    serve as attorney or agent for the facility in any probate
    proceeding in which the Retirement Home may have a legal interest
    as nominated fiduciary, testamentary legatee, escheat legatee, or
    in any other capacity.
      (B) An attorney designated under this paragraph may, in the
    domiciliary jurisdiction of the deceased resident and in any
    ancillary jurisdiction, petition for appointment as fiduciary. The
    attorney shall have priority over any petitioners (other than the
    deceased resident's nominated fiduciary, named legatees, or heirs)
    to serve as fiduciary. In a probate proceeding in which the heirs
    of an intestate deceased resident cannot be located and in a
    probate proceeding in which the nominated fiduciary, legatees, or
    heirs of a testate deceased resident cannot be located, the
    attorney shall be appointed as the fiduciary of the deceased
    resident's estate.
      (3) The designation of an employee or representative of a
    facility of the Retirement Home as personal representative of the
    estate of a resident of the Retirement Home or as a legatee under
    the will or codicil of the resident shall not disqualify an
    employee or staff member of that facility from serving as a
    competent witness to a will or codicil of the resident.
      (4) After the end of the three-year period beginning on the date
    of the death of a resident of a facility, the Director of the
    facility shall dispose of all property of the deceased resident
    that is not otherwise disposed of under this subsection, including
    personal effects such as decorations, medals, and citations to
    which a right has not been established under subsection (a) of this
    section. Disposal may be made within the discretion of the Director
    by - 
        (A) retaining such property or effects for the facility;
        (B) offering such items to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, a
      State, another military home, a museum, or any other institution
      having an interest in such items; or
        (C) destroying any items determined by the Director to be
      valueless.
    (c) Transfer of proceeds to Fund
      The net proceeds received by the Directors from the sale of
    effects under subsection (b) of this section shall be deposited in
    the Fund.
    (d) Subsequent claim
      (1) A claim for the net proceeds of the sale under subsection (b)
    of this section of the effects of a deceased may be filed with the
    Secretary of Defense at any time within six years after the death
    of the deceased, for action under section 2771 of title 10.
      (2) A claim referred to in paragraph (1) may not be considered by
    a court or the Secretary unless the claim is filed within the time
    period prescribed in such paragraph.
      (3) A claim allowed by the Secretary under paragraph (1) shall be
    certified to the Secretary of the Treasury for payment from the
    Fund in the amount found due, including any interest relating to
    the amount. No claim may be allowed or paid in excess of the net
    proceeds of the estate deposited in the Fund under subsection (c)
    of this section plus interest.
    (e) Unclaimed property
      In the case of property delivered to the Retirement Home under
    section 2575 of title 10, the Director of the facility shall
    deliver the property to the owner, the heirs or next of kin of the
    owner, or the legal representative of the owner, if a right to the
    property is established to the satisfaction of the Director of the
    facility within two years after the delivery.
