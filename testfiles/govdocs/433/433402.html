Incorporation of 30 mol% cholesterol slowed the rate of MII-G(t) complex formation by about 400% in 18:0,18:1PC, but by less than 25% in 18:0,22:6PC bilayers.

When rhodopsin was photolyzed in the presence of several n-alcohols, increased MII formation was observed in the order ethanol > butanol > hexanol, whereas longer chain n-alcohols inhibited MII formation with decanol > octanol. The magnitude of the stimulatory effects was greater in a more highly unsaturated phospholipid. Alcohols, which enhanced MII formation also increased phospholipid acyl chain packing free volume, while those that decreased this bilayer property inhibited MII formation. An apparent discontinuity in the effect of these alcohols results when their potency is calculated in terms of the total aqueous alcohol concentration. In sharp contrast, a continuous variation in their behavior is observed, when their potency is calculated in terms of the amount of alcohol partitioned in the membrane.

The extent of formation of metarhodopsin II (MII), the G protein--activating photointermediate of rhodopsin, increased progressively with the level of acyl chain unsaturation at the sn-2 position. Added cholesterol reduced the amount of MII. The acyl chain packing free volume of the rhodopsin containing lipid vesicles was characterized by derived from measurements of the time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy decay of the hydrophobic membrane probe 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene. The relationship among sn-2 acyl chain unsaturation, cholesterol content, and MII formation is explained on the basis of variation in a fractional volume parameter with bilayer lipid composition and a novel model for the packing of phospholipids containing polyenoic acyl chains, such as 22:6n-3.</font></b><font size="1">Litman BJ, Mitchell DC.

 Phospholipid composition had a marked effect on ethanol potency, with the presence of polyunsaturated phospholipid acyl chains increasing ethanol potency by 40%. The effects of ethanol on lipid acyl chain packing in POPC and PDPC were investigated using frequency domain anisotropy decay measurements of the fluorescent membrane probe 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene. Enhanced formation of MII due to the presence of ethanol was correlated with the effects of ethanol on acyl chain packing properties.

For mixtures of nonlamellar-forming dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) with dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC), calculations of the membrane surface pH confirmed that an increase in DOPE favored the meta II state.  Rhodopsin may function to balance forces within the bilayer with a negative spontaneous curvature. A new biophysical principle is introduced: matching of the spontaneous curvature of the lipid bilayer to the mean curvature of the lipid/water interface adjacent to the protein, which balances the lipid/protein solvation energy. In this manner, the thermodynamic driving force for the meta I-meta II conformational change of rhodopsin is tightly controlled by mixtures of nonlamellar-forming lipids having distinctive material properties.</font></b><font size="1">Botelho AV, Gibson NJ, Thurmond RL, Wang Y, Brown MF.
