<P>The light-driven photocycle of rhodopsin begins the photoreceptor
cascade that underlies visual response. In a sequence of events, the
retinal covalently attached to the rhodopsin protein undergoes a
conformational change that communicates local changes to a global
conformational change throughout the whole protein. In turn, the
large-scale protein change then activates G-proteins and signal
amplification throughout the cell. The nature of this change,
involving a coupling between a local process and larger changes
throughout the protein, may be important for many membrane
proteins. In addition, functional work has shown that this coupling
occurs with different efficiency in different lipid settings. To begin
to understand the nature of the efficiency of this coupling in
different lipid settings, we present a molecular dynamics study of
rhodopsin in an explicit dioleoyl-phosphatidylcholine bilayer. Our
system was simulated for 40 ns and provides insights into the very
early events of the visual cascade, before the full transition and
activation have occurred. In particular, we see an event near 10 ns
that begins with a change in hydrogen bonding near the retinal and
that leads through a series of coupled changes to a shift in helical
tilt. This type of event, though rare on the molecular dynamics
time-scale, could be an important clue to the types of coupling that
occur between local and large-scale conformational change in many
membrane proteins. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
