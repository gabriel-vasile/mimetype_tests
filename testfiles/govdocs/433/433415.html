<P>DATE:  June 1, 1998
<P>In the Case of:	            
<P>Gold Country Health Center,
<br>Petitioner,             
<P>	  - v.-               
<P>Health Care Financing Administration.         	  
<P>Docket No. C-96-109
<br>Decision No. CR533



<P><CENTER><STRONG>DECISION</STRONG></CENTER>



<P>Below, I reverse the determination made by the Health Care Financing
Administration (HCFA) that Gold Country Health Center (Gold Country) was out of
compliance<A HREF="#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A> with the Medicare participation requirements contained in 42 C.F.R. §
483.10(g)(2) as of the time Gold Country was surveyed by HCFA on November 17,
1995.  I do so because HCFA has failed to sustain its burden of presenting a prima
facie case of noncompliance under said regulation, 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2).  


<P>My decision is based on my review of the documentary evidence and written
arguments submitted by the parties. As explained in my Ruling Denying HCFA's
Renewed Motion for Dismissal or for Summary Disposition and Scheduling Order
(June 20, 1997), at 9, I made a preliminary determination that the issues concerning
Gold Country's compliance with 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2) may be properly
adjudicated without the need for any in-person testimony.  In addition, I stated the
following in my June 20, 1997 ruling and scheduling order, at page 9:


<P>	<U>However</U>, if I become persuaded (based on a motion from a party or
based on my review of the parties' documentary submissions) that this
case cannot be fully or expeditiously resolved without my hearing
witness testimony, I will so inform the parties and discuss with their
counsel an appropriate date and site for an in-person hearing.


<P>To date, HCFA has filed no motion requesting the introduction of live witness
testimony nor has HCFA objected to my making a decision based on the written
record.  Gold Country has consistently maintained that it did not wish to have an in-person hearing to resolve the issues concerning 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2).  My review
of the parties' subsequent submissions did not indicate that in-person testimony
would be necessary.  Accordingly, I have made my decision based on the totality of
the documentary evidence and written arguments of record.<A HREF="#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A>

<P><CENTER><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW<A HREF="#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A></STRONG></CENTER>



<P>1.  The matter properly before me for adjudication is HCFA's determination that
Gold Country was out of substantial compliance with the requirements of 42 C.F.R §
483.10(g)(2), as a result of a survey it conducted on November 17, 1995.  <U>See</U>
Sections I-A and VI-C, below.

<P> 

<P>2.  HCFA is incorrect in contending that Gold Country has admitted its
noncompliance with program requirements and that, consequently, Gold Country is
without any hearing rights.  <U>See</U> Section I-A.


<P>3.  The following matters are undisputed for the noncompliance determination made
by HCFA against Gold Country under 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2):


<P>	A.  the relevant findings were made by HCFA during the survey it
conducted on November 17, 1995 (HCFA Ex. 9);


<P>	B.  the ombudsman's office involved in this case, the El Dorado
County Department of Community Services, was a client advocacy
agency within the meaning of 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2) (<U>see</U> Section I-A, below);

<P>	C.  the El Dorado County Department of Community Services is a
State governmental agency supported by public funds (HCFA Ex. 26);


<P>	D. Kathryne Meyers was assigned to Gold Country as an ombudsman
representative of the El Dorado County Department of Community
Services (HCFA Exs. 26, 29); 



<P>	E. John Litwinovich was the head of the El Dorado County
Department of Community Services and Ms. Meyers' superior (<U>e.g.</U>,
HCFA Ex. 29 at 2, para. 4; HCFA Ex. 30 at 3, para. 5);


<P>	F.  William R. Niehoff was an official of the legal entity in Long
Beach, California, which operated Gold Country, and, in that
capacity, he represented Gold Country as well (<U>see</U> Section II-A,
below); 


<P>	G.  Gold Country was a long-term care facility located in Placerville,
California, which was participating in the Medicare and Medicaid
programs;


<P>	H.  Gold Country was obligated to be in substantial compliance with
the requirements of 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2);


<P>	I.  HCFA did not make any finding of deficiency against Gold
Country under the other related "resident rights" requirements
contained in 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(b)(7)(iii) and (iv), or (f) through
(k)(<U>see</U> Section VII-H, below);


<P>	J.  HCFA did not make any finding of deficiency against Gold
Country under the "quality of life" requirements for residents
contained in 42 C.F.R. § 483.15(c)(1) - (6)(<U>see</U> Section VII-G(2),
below); 


<P>	K.  no evidence introduced by HCFA relates specifically to the
examination of survey results by the residents of Gold Country  <U>see</U>
Section VI-B.


<P>4.  The survey conducted by HCFA on November 17, 1995 was supposed to have
been a "resurvey" to verify Gold Country's allegations of compliance with
requirements unrelated to 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2).  <U>See</U> Section II-A, below.

<P> 

<P>5.  During the November 17, 1995 survey, HCFA surveyors interviewed only
Kathryne Meyers, an ombudsman assigned to Gold Country, and reviewed the
following six documents (the first four of which were provided by Ms. Meyers to the HCFA surveyors) in concluding that Gold Country was out of compliance with
42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2): 

<P>	A.  a copy of Mr. Niehoff's letter dated October 31, 1995, to John
Litwinovich (Ms. Meyers' superior);


<P>	B.  two letters from area nursing home administrators complementing
Ms. Meyers' professionalism; 

<P>	C. the ombudsman's record concerning Gold Country's report of its
residents' complaints 

<P>	D. the facility's incident/accident log; and

<P>	E. the minutes from the Family Council's September 1995 meeting.  

<P><U>See</U> Section II-A, below.

<P>6.  In a case of this type, HCFA has the burden of moving forward with the evidence
under the following process:

<P>	A.  with its notice of matters which give rise to hearing rights under
42 C.F.R. § 498.3(b)(12), HCFA must set forth the basis for its
relevant determinations with sufficient specificity for the facility to
respond, including its basis for finding that the facility was out of
noncompliance;  

<P>	B.  the facility must identify the findings or conclusions material to
the determination it disputes, as well as any additional facts it is
asserting.


<P>	C.  at hearing (whether or not in-person testimony is also introduced
as evidence), HCFA has the burden of coming forward with evidence
related to the disputed findings which is sufficient -- when that
evidence is viewed together with any undisputed findings and the
relevant legal authority -- to establish a prima facie case that HCFA
has a legally sufficient basis for having reached the determination(s)
in controversy.


<P><U>See</U> Section I-B, below.


<P>7.  HCFA's reasons for finding Gold Country out of compliance with 42 C.F.R. §
483.10(g)(2) were explained in the following two documents included with HCFA's
notice letter dated December 8, 1995 to Gold Country:


<P>	A. HCFA's survey report/statement of deficiencies (i.e., HCFA Form
2567) for the November 17, 1995 survey and 


<P>	B. the "Directed Plan of Correction, Tag F-168" drafted and imposed
by HCFA.  


<P><U>See</U> Section II-B, below.


<P>8.  The hearing request filed by Gold Country raised legal and factual disputes
concerning HCFA's determination of Gold Country's noncompliance with 42 C.F.R.
§ 483.10(g)(2).  <U>See</U> Section III, below.    

<P>    

<P>9.  HCFA submitted the declaration of one of its surveyors, Kenneth Simpson, who
alleged for the first time that the noncompliance determination at issue was based
also on additional facts and analyses.  <U>See</U> Section IV, below.


<P>10.  After receiving Mr. Simpson's declaration, Gold Country has also submitted
additional arguments and counter-declarations.  <U>See</U> Section V.


<P>11.  I deny HCFA's motion to strike from the record the new arguments and counter-declarations submitted by Gold Country; nor do I find it appropriate or necessary to
accept additional filings from HCFA on these matters.  <U>See</U> Sections V and VI-A.


<P>12.  I reject Gold Country's arguments that, as a matter of law, noncompliance with
42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2) cannot be proved without evidence which relates solely to
the residents' examination of survey results.  <U>See</U> Section VI-B.  


<P>13.  In order to establish a prima facie case in these proceedings, HCFA's evidence
relating to each disputed issue must be substantially consistent <U>inter</U> <U>se</U>, appear
credible on its face, and lead reasonably and logically to the conclusions that as of
the November 17, 1995 survey:


<P>	A.  Gold Country had acted, or failed to act, in a manner which was
deficient (<U>i.e.</U>, which constituted a "deficiency" within the meaning of
42 C.F.R. § 488.301) when measured against the requirements
contained in 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2) and


<P>	B.  if HCFA's evidence established any deficiency under 42 C.F.R. §
483.10(g)(2), the deficiency has the potential for causing more than
minimal harm to the health or safety of Gold Country's residents.


<P><U>See</U> Section VII-A, below.


<P>14.  With respect to HCFA's introduction of Mr. Niehoff's October 31, 1995 letter to
Mr. Litwinovich and Mr. Litwinovich's return letter dated November 15, 1995 as part
of its prima facie case, the contents and context of said documents are at odds with
the interpretations HCFA has provided in support of its determination that Gold
Country was out of compliance with 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2) as of the November
17, 1995 survey.  <U>See</U> Section VII-B, below.


<P>15.  The rights specified in 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2) belong to the residents of a
facility, and, within the factual context of this case, this regulation meant that Gold
Country's residents were entitled to contact and receive information from Ms.
Meyers or the ombudsman's office she represented.  <U>See</U> Section VII-C.


<P>16.  The noncompliance determination at issue was based in significant part upon
HCFA's incorrect interpretation of 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2) as containing
requirements that a facility was obligated to engage in "open communications" with
the relevant client advocacy agencies and maintain a cooperative or nonadversarial
relationship with those agencies which advances these agencies' objectives.  <U>See</U>
Section VII-C.  


<P>17.  The HCFA surveyor's opinions concerning Gold Country's adversarial
relationship with the ombudsman's office (based upon the inferences the surveyors
drew from Mr. Niehoff's October 31, 1995 letter), even if assumed true, do not
constitute sufficient or material proof that a deficiency existed under 42 C.F.R. §
483.10(g)(2).  <U>See</U> Section VII-B.


<P>18.  Even if 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2) could be interpreted as requiring a facility to
communicate openly or cooperate with the Ombudsman's office, HCFA has
improperly interpreted and misapplied such requirements to the facts established by
its evidence.  <U>See</U> Section VII-D.


<P>19.  In submitting Mr. Niehoff's October 31, 1995 letter as evidence that Gold
Country was out of compliance because it refused to accede to the ombudsman's
request to mail out certain materials for her, HCFA has improperly interpreted the
requirements of 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2).  <U>See</U> Section VII-E. 


<P>20.  HCFA's evidence does not show that Gold Country's residents were the
recipients of the materials the ombudsman had asked Gold Country to mail; nor that
the ombudsman and her office were precluded by Gold Country from mailing the
materials directly to Gold Country's residents; nor that Gold Country's residents
would be unable to receive information from the ombudsman or her office unless
Gold Country were to do the mailings as requested.  <U>See</U> Section VII-E.  


<P>21.  HCFA's evidence shows that it has misinterpreted 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2) by
referring to the transmittal of information concerning the Family Council and to the
residents' families, when this regulation does not pertain to the rights of a Family
Council and HCFA has made no showing that any family member in this case has
acquired the legal standing to exercise a resident's rights under 42 C.F.R. §
483.10(g)(2).  <U>See</U> Sections VII-F and G(2)(ii).     


<P>22.  The information contained in Ms. Meyers' declaration submitted by HCFA is
deficient and, even when considered together with other evidence also introduced by
HCFA, does not provide valid support for HCFA's conclusions that Gold Country
had deficiencies under 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2), or that the health or safety of Gold
Country's residents were placed at more than minimal risk as a result.  <U>See</U> Section
VII-G. 


<P>23.  HCFA's evidence on Gold Country's failure to report its residents' allegations to
the ombudsman, even when considered together with other evidence also introduced
by HCFA, is not adequate for establishing that Gold Country had a deficiency under
42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2).  <U>See</U> Section VII-H.


<P>24.  HCFA has failed in its obligation to present a prima facie case.  <U>See</U> Sections
VII-A through H, and all corresponding FFCLs.

<P><CENTER><STRONG>DISCUSSION</STRONG></CENTER>

<P>I.  <U>OVERVIEW</U>
<P><STRONG>A.  Gold Country has the right to challenge the finding of noncompliance made
by HCFA under 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2).</STRONG>

<P>The regulation relied upon by HCFA states as follows: 

<P>	(g) Examination of survey results.  A resident has the right to --

<P>			(2) Receive information from agencies acting as
client advocates[<A HREF="#N_4_"><SUP>(4)</SUP></A>
<P>], and be afforded the opportunity
to contact these agencies.



<P>42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2).  In summarizing  its noncompliance determination in
dispute, HCFA has stated that:


<P>	[a]s a result of the November 17, 1995 follow-up survey, the facility
was found to be in violation of the following Federal requirements, at
42 C.F.R. Part 483, to wit: (1) Petitioner failed to ensure that residents
and their families had access to information from client advocacy
agencies, in violation of 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2) because they [i.e.,
Petitioner] were on record as declining to cooperate with the
ombudsman program, thus having the potential for affecting all of the
residents in the facility, with a scope and severity level of "F" on the
Grid (which is attached as HCFA Ex. 27), <U>i.e</U>., a widespread potential
for more than minimal harm that is not immediate jeopardy, with no
actual harm (F 168) . . . .


<P>HCFA's Motion to Dismiss or Alternatively, for Summary Disposition (HCFA Mot.
to Dism.), 1 - 2.  HCFA, by its Associate Regional Administrator for the Division of
Health Standards and Quality, stated also in her declaration that the deficiency
HCFA considered to have been most significant and purposeful was "Gold Country's
explicit refusal to cooperate with the State Ombudsman program."  Declaration of
Janice M. Caldwell at 3, attached to HCFA Renewed Motion for Dismissal or for
Summary Disposition.


<P>I had previously detailed some of the background facts and procedural history of this
case in my initial ruling dated February 11, 1997, which denied HCFA's Motion for
Dismissal or for Summary Disposition, and in my subsequent ruling dated June 20,
1997, which denied HCFA Renewed Motion for Dismissal or for Summary
Disposition.  I hereby incorporate the findings and conclusions contained in those
rulings.<A HREF="#N_5_"><SUP>(5)</SUP></A>


<P>However, I find it necessary to re-emphasize selected portions of my prior rulings
due to certain misleading statements contained in HCFA's current brief to me.  For
example, HCFA contends incorrectly that Gold Country is merely disputing findings
of deficiencies in the current proceedings.  HCFA Br., at 4.  HCFA contends that I
lack jurisdiction to consider the issues arising from 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2) because
"there is no authority under 42 C.F.R. Part 498 for the review of <U>individual
deficiency findings</U> where, as here, such review cannot change the determination that
the facility was (or was not) in substantial compliance with applicable participation
requirements[,]" and Gold Country has already "conceded that it is not in substantial
compliance, and <U>is only contesting a particular deficiency</U>."  HCFA Br., at 4
(emphasis added). 

<P>HCFA has misstated the facts and misconstrued my rulings.


<P>HCFA's representations concerning Gold Country's alleged challenges to mere
deficiencies are contrary to the facts of record and the legal basis previously relied
upon by HCFA in moving for dismissal or for summary disposition against Gold
Country.  In fact, HCFA made not one, <U>but three</U>, noncompliance determinations
under three unrelated regulations.  However, as I had determined in my previous
rulings, only one of the three noncompliance determinations resulted in the
imposition of an enforcement remedy by HCFA.  


<P>A survey conducted by HCFA<A HREF="#N_6_"><SUP>(6)</SUP></A> on November 17, 1995 resulted in the citation of
deficiencies under three distinct categories designated by separate "F Tag"
identifiers.  I noted that the assignment of a "scope and severity" (SS) level of "D" or
above to each group of deficiencies by HCFA and its agent resulted in three
corresponding noncompliance determinations:


<P>	-- noncompliance under 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2) "Examination of
Survey Results" -- F Tag 168 and SS Level "F";


<P>	-- noncompliance under 42 C.F.R. § 483.20(b) "Resident Assessment"
-- F Tag 272 and SS Level "E"; and


<P>	-- noncompliance under 42 C.F.R. § 483.25(l)(1) "Quality of Care" --
F Tag 329 and SS Level "D".


<P>Feb. 11, 1997 Ruling, at 3 (# 2); June 20, 1997 Ruling at 1 - 2 (# 1).  


<P>In my rulings, I specifically used the term "noncompliance" to describe HCFA's
determinations for <U>each</U> of these three categories of deficiencies because, as
established by HCFA's evidence, a SS Level of "D" or above is assigned by HCFA to
those deficiencies which coincide with the regulatory definitions of
"noncompliance."<A HREF="#N_7_"><SUP>(7)</SUP></A>  HCFA's memorandum in support of its motion to dismiss
especially noted and made arguments based on the assignment of the "D" and above
levels to each group of deficiencies identified in this case.  Mem. in Supp. of HCFA
Mot. to Dis., at 1 - 2.<A HREF="#N_8_"><SUP>(8)</SUP></A>  Therefore, even though a "deficiency" means a "failure to
meet a participation requirement specified in the Act or in [42 C.F.R.] part 483,
subpart B. . . ." (42 C.F.R. § 488.301), deficiencies of the "D" level or above
constitute "noncompliance" as a matter of law.  For these reasons, I concluded that
HCFA had made three separate noncompliance determinations in this case -- and <U>not</U>,
as suggested by HCFA in its most recent brief, one single noncompliance
determination resulting from the cumulative effect of individual deficiencies
identified under separate regulations. 


<P>Previously, HCFA had acknowledged the existence of three separate and
independent findings of noncompliance under three regulations or F Tags when it
filed its initial motion for dismissal or for summary disposition.  HCFA's motion was
based on the fact that Gold Country had decided to withdraw its challenges to
HCFA's findings under F Tag 272 (42 C.F.R. § 483.20(b), "Resident Assessment"). 
According to HCFA, Gold Country's withdrawal of its challenge to the one set of
findings under F Tag 272 constituted an admission that "it was not in substantial
compliance during the November 17, 1995 revisit."  Mem. in Supp. of HCFA Mot. to
Dism., at 3.<A HREF="#N_9_"><SUP>(9)</SUP></A>   HCFA argued also that Gold Country's challenges under the remaining
two F Tags and regulations (F Tags 168 and 329, or 42 C.F.R. §§ 483.10(g)(2) and
483.25(l)(1)) should be dismissed pursuant to 42 C.F.R. § 498.3(b)(12) and my
decisions in <U>Country Club Center, II</U>, DAB CR433 (1996) and <U>University Towers
Medical Pavilion</U>, DAB CR436 (1996).<A HREF="#N_10_"><SUP>(10)</SUP></A>  


<P>I denied HCFA's motion to dismiss or for summary disposition because, according to
the evidence of record, the only enforcement remedy imposed by HCFA against
Gold Country  was the "Directed Plan of Correction, Tag F - 168" (HCFA Ex. 10 at
5), which showed on its face that it was triggered only by the noncompliance finding
HCFA made under 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2) and which contained nothing related to
any requirements of 42 C.F.R. §§ 483.20(b) or 483.25(l)(1) (F Tags 272 and 329,
respectively).  Feb. 11, 1997 Ruling at 8 - 10.  Due to the lack of evidentiary support
for HCFA's contentions, I had specifically rejected HCFA's efforts to associate the
"Directed Plan of Correction , Tag F - 168" as the enforcement remedy which
resulted from HCFA's determination of noncompliance under F Tag 272 or 42 C.F.R.
§ 483.20(b).  Feb. 11, 1997 Ruling at 9-10.  However, I left HCFA with the option of
renewing its motion to dismiss if HCFA were to provide affirmative evidence
showing that the "Directed Plan of Correction, Tag F - 168" of record was in fact
imposed as a result of the noncompliance determination made by HCFA under F Tag
272.  <U>Id</U>. at 10.     


<P>HCFA filed its renewed motion to dismiss and reaffirmed that each of the SS levels
for the cited deficiencies was at "D" or above.  <U>See</U> Mem. in Supp of Renewed Mot.
to Dism., at 1 - 2.  However, HCFA began to imply also that the findings it made
under each of the three regulations and corresponding F Tags were of individual
deficiencies which -- only in the aggregate -- resulted in a single finding of
noncompliance.<A HREF="#N_11_"><SUP>(11)</SUP></A>  This implication is contrary to the "D," "E," and "F" SS levels
separately assigned by HCFA to the three independent groups of alleged violations,
and this implication is inconsistent with the legal definition of noncompliance. 
Therefore, in denying HCFA's renewed motion, I noted once again that three
separate noncompliance determinations had been made by HCFA under three
regulations or F Tags.  June 20, 1997 Ruling at 1 - 2.


<P>As discussed in my earlier rulings, pursuant to 42 C.F.R. § 498.3(b)(12), Gold
Country is entitled to a hearing only on HCFA's finding of noncompliance under 42
C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2) (F Tag 168).<A HREF="#N_12_"><SUP>(12)</SUP></A>  By virtue of HCFA's decision to impose only
the remedy of the "Directed Plan of Correction, Tag F-168" of record, HCFA's
noncompliance determination under 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2) (F Tag 168) is the only
one (out of the three made by HCFA) that satisfies the "results in the imposition of a
remedy

<P>. . ." test of  42 C.F.R. § 498.3(b)(12).<A HREF="#N_13_"><SUP>(13)</SUP></A>
<P>  The other two findings of noncompliance
made by HCFA under other regulations did not result in the imposition of any
enforcement remedies against Gold Country and are not subject to adjudication.<A HREF="#N_14_"><SUP>(14)</SUP></A> 
Therefore, I have the authority to decide the merits of the parties' positions with
respect to 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2), even though Gold Country has decided not to
contest at least one of the other findings of noncompliance.


<P><STRONG>B.  HCFA bears the burden of moving forward to establish a prima facie case,
pursuant to the process explained in the <U>Hillman</U> decision.</STRONG>


<P>In my most recent prehearing order, I adopted the burden of persuasion allocation set
forth in <U>Hillman Rehabilitation Center</U>, DAB No. 1611 (1997).  <U>See</U> June 20, 1997
Ruling at 9.  Subsequently, HCFA  acknowledged that under <U>Hillman</U>, it has the
obligation to establish a prima facie case as part of its burden of moving forward
with the evidence in the present case before me.  HCFA Br., at 4 - 5.  Gold Country
has filed no objection to these matters.  


<P>The <U>Hillman</U> decision explains the process which places the burden upon HCFA to
present a prima facie case:


<P>	[1]  HCFA must set forth the basis for its determination terminating a
provider with sufficient specificity for the provider to respond,
including the basis for any finding that a condition-level deficiency
exists.  


<P>	[2] The provider must then identify which of the findings material to
the determination the provider disputes, and must also identify any
additional facts the provider is asserting.


<P>	[3] At the hearing, HCFA has the burden of coming forward with
evidence related to disputed findings that is sufficient (together with
any undisputed findings and relevant legal authority) to establish a
prima facie case that HCFA had a legally sufficient basis for
termination.


<P><U>Hillman</U>, at 8.  As indicated by the first two steps quoted above, disputed issues of
fact or law are created when HCFA sets forth sufficiently clear rationale for having
reached the relevant determination, and the petitioner then identifies its disagreement
with some or all of HCFA's findings or legal interpretations, together with
petitioner's bases for the disagreement.  At the third step cited above, HCFA assumes
the burden of introducing sufficient evidence to establish, prima facie, the merits of
its position with respect to each material finding or conclusion controverted by the
petitioner.  The evidence submitted by HCFA to establish its prima facie case needs
to be material to the correct interpretation of the pertinent legal authorities.<A HREF="#N_15_"><SUP>(15)</SUP></A>  If
HCFA fails to establish a prima facie case at the third step, the burden of moving
forward with the evidence does not shift to the petitioner.  <U>Id</U>. 


<P>In my June 20, 1997 ruling and scheduling order, I determined that the case is "now
limited to Petitioner's challenges of F Tag 168."  June 20, 1997 Ruling at 9. 

<P>I authorized Gold Country to file its brief first because its hearing request had raised
a threshold legal issue (<U>i.e.</U>, the proper interpretation of 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2)),
which could have been dispositive of this action.  I reviewed Gold Country's brief
first solely for the purpose of deciding this threshold legal issue.  Having rejected
Gold Country's legal arguments for the reasons stated below, I then proceeded to
review HCFA's evidence and arguments to determine if HCFA had established its
prima facie case.  


<P><STRONG>C. Organization of remaining discussions<U></U></STRONG>


<P>Relying on the above-quoted discussion from <U>Hillman</U>, I have organized my Decision
to approximate the steps which lead to and include HCFA's burden to establish a
prima facie case on the general issue of whether Gold Country was out of compliance
with 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2).  


<P>Accordingly, Sections II through V of this Decision contain a description of those
events which gave rise to the issues of fact and law which HCFA is obligated to
address as part of its prima facie case.  My discussions therein will show also that
some additional issues arose during litigation because HCFA introduced new
theories and evidence with its brief.<A HREF="#N_16_"><SUP>(16)</SUP></A>  Much of the information discussed in these
sections, such as the nature and extent of evidence gathered by HCFA when it
surveyed Gold Country, has relevancy to the prima facie case HCFA is attempting to
establish.  Additionally, the information I set forth in Sections II and IV will show
the manner in which HCFA has expanded its originally stated bases for the
noncompliance determination in dispute: for example, expansions from its surveyors'
disagreements with Gold Country's views that the September 1995 Family Council
meeting minutes were "inflammatory and confrontational" and that two other nursing
home administrators also shared a disrespect for an individual ombudsman (HCFA
Ex. 9 at 1 - 2) -- to HCFA's more recently submitted theories in litigation that Gold
Country was hostile towards, uncooperative with, and attacking the entire
ombudsman program (<U>e.g.</U>, HCFA Exs. 29, 30).   

<P>  

<P>Section VI of this Decision contains my rulings on outstanding objections and legal
issues.


<P>In the remaining portion of this Decision, I will discuss my conclusion that HCFA
has failed to satisfy its burden of establishing a prima facie case of Gold Country's
noncompliance with the requirements of 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2).     


<P>II.  <U>THE INFORMATION HCFA PROVIDED WITH ITS NOTICE LETTER TO
EXPLAIN THE NONCOMPLIANCE DETERMINATION IT MADE UNDER 42
C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2), AS A RESULT OF THE RESURVEY CONDUCTED ON
NOVEMBER 17, 1995</U>  


<P><STRONG>A.  The facts of record establish that while HCFA surveyors were conducting a
resurvey to ascertain Gold Country's correction of other deficiencies, they
received information from a representative of the local ombudsman program,
reviewed certain records, and found Gold Country out of compliance with 42
C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2). </STRONG>


<P>The controversy concerning Gold Country's compliance with 42 C.F.R. §
483.10(g)(2) began with what was supposed to have been a "resurvey" on November
17, 1995 to verify its allegations of compliance with other participation
requirements.  


<P>Previous to November 17, 1995, a state agency under contract to HCFA had
conducted a survey of Gold Country.  HCFA Ex. 10.  Based on the earlier survey
concluded on October 31, 1995, Gold Country was found to have been out of
compliance with the requirements of several regulations.  HCFA Exs. 1, 10.  In
response to the findings from that prior survey, Gold Country submitted "a plan of
correction and credible allegation of compliance."  HCFA Ex. 10 at 1.<A HREF="#N_17_"><SUP>(17)</SUP></A>  Because the
October 31 survey team concluded also that Gold Country's noncompliance with one
regulation constituted immediate jeopardy to its residents,<A HREF="#N_18_"><SUP>(18)</SUP></A> surveyors could not
assume its allegation of compliance to be true and needed to conduct a revisit survey
in order "to verify that [Gold Country] had achieved and maintained compliance as
alleged."  <U>Id</U>.  


<P>Gold Country had not been cited for any deficiency under 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2)
as a result of the October 31, 1995 survey.  HCFA Ex. 1.  There would have been no
reason for Gold Country to allege compliance with said regulation in its plan of
correction for the October 31 survey.  Therefore, no resurvey conducted on
November 17, 1995 should have automatically evaluated Gold Country's compliance
under 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2).  42 C.F.R. § 488.20(b)(1).


<P>HCFA's evidence establishes that two of its Nurse Surveyors, Kenneth Simpson and
Brian Asay, were sent to conduct the resurvey of Gold Country on November 17,
1995.  HCFA Exs. 10, 24, 30.  However, the noncompliance determination made
under 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2) did not result from the use of protocols applicable to
resurveys.  <U>See</U> 42 C.F.R. § 488.20(b)(1).  Instead, as discussed below, a complaint
by the ombudsman assigned to Gold Country appears to have triggered the surveyors'
inquiries into Gold Country's alleged noncompliance with 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2). 
The regulations do not mandate a specific protocol for investigating complaints
against long-term care facilities.  In this case, the evidence introduced by HCFA does
not show that the surveyors spoke with any resident concerning the exercise of their
rights under 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2), even though the regulation states generally
that "surveyors will directly observe the actual provision of care and services to
residents."  42 C.F.R. § 488.26(c)(2).


<P>The survey report/statement of deficiencies (HCFA Form 2567) issued by HCFA as
a result of the November 17, 1995 survey contains only the following information
concerning HCFA's finding of noncompliance under 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2) :


<P>	483.10(g)(2) REQUIREMENT:  EXAMINATION OF SURVEY
RESULTS


<P>	A resident has the right to receive information from agencies acting as
client advocates, and be afforded the opportunity to contact these
agencies.


<P>	This REQUIREMENT is not met as evidenced by[:] 


<P>	Based on interview, review of correspondence between the facility's
corporation and the El Dorado County ombudsman program, the
ombudsman's contact records, and facility incident/accident logs, the
facility failed to ensure that residents and their families have access to
information from client advocacy agencies.


<P>	The findings include:


<P>	1.  Correspondence sent from the facility's parent corporation to the El
Dorado County Department of Community Services was reviewed. 
This letter was dated 10/31/95, which coincides with the ending date
of a federal complaint survey of the facility.  In this letter the
corporation stated, "[w]e will not be a part of nor will we support the
Ombudsman program by providing the vehicle whereby they exercise
continuing criticism and confrontation."  This letter also charged that
the minutes of the September Family Council meeting were
"inflammatory and confrontational[,]" which the surveyor did not find
to be true.  The letter also included attacks on the professionalism and
character of one ombudsman in particular, alleging the "mutual
feelings of disrespect that the three nursing homes in Placerville have
toward (this ombudsman)" -- letters from the other two nursing
facilities in Placerville were examined, and the content and tone of
those letters did not support Gold Country's allegations. 


<P>HCFA Ex. 9 at 1-2.


<P>Other evidence introduced by HCFA establishes that only Kathryne Meyers, an
ombudsman assigned to Gold Country, was interviewed for the survey.<A HREF="#N_19_"><SUP>(19)</SUP></A>  The survey
report/statement of deficiencies which was issued by HCFA did not disclose the
information provided by Ms. Meyers.  HCFA Ex. 9.  However, according to a later
executed declaration from a HCFA surveyor, Ms. Meyers showed the surveyors a
copy of a letter dated October 31, 1995,<A HREF="#N_20_"><SUP>(20)</SUP></A> in which William R. Niehoff, Market Rate
Operations Director for Retirement Housing Foundation (RHF), criticized Ms.
Meyers' activities at Gold Country and represented that other nursing home
administrators in the Placerville area also held her in low esteem.  HCFA Ex. 30 at 3;
HCFA Ex. 2.<A HREF="#N_21_"><SUP>(21)</SUP></A>  


<P>Mr. Niehoff of RHF, which is located in Long Beach, California, wrote the letter
because RHF operates Gold Country, in Placerville, California.  P. Br., at 1; HCFA
Ex. 2.  Mr. Niehoff addressed his letter to John Litwinovich of the El Dorado County
Department of Community Services, and provided copies of his letter to Gold
Country's Administrator, Keith Berry, and their Corporate Nursing Consultant. 
HCFA Ex. 2.  Other evidence submitted by HCFA establish without dispute that the
intended recipient of the October 31 letter, Mr. Litwinovich, was the head of the El
Dorado County Department of Community Services and Ms. Meyers' superior.<A HREF="#N_22_"><SUP>(22)</SUP></A>  <U>See</U>
HCFA Ex. 29 at 2; HCFA Ex. 30 at 3.  HCFA's surveyor was aware that Ms. Meyers
worked as Mr. Litwinovich's subordinate.  HCFA Ex. 30 at 3. 

<P> 

<P>It appears from HCFA's survey report/statement of deficiencies (HCFA Form 2567)
that, because Mr. Niehoff's letter described the Family Council meeting minutes as
"inflammatory and confrontational" (HCFA Ex. 2 at 2), HCFA surveyors then
reviewed the minutes from the September meeting of the Family Council and "did
not find [Mr. Niehoff's descriptions] to be true."   HCFA Ex. 9 at 2.  The evidence
from HCFA does not disclose from whom the surveyors had obtained the minutes for
the September 1995 Family Council meeting.


<P>It appears also from HCFA's survey report/statement of deficiencies that, because
Mr. Niehoff informed Ms. Meyers' boss in the October 31 letter that the two other
nursing homes in the Placerville area also shared "mutual feelings of disrespect" for
Ms. Meyers (HCFA Ex. 9 at 2), the surveyors then interpreted those words as
"attacks on [Ms. Meyers'] professionalism and character" which were not supported
by the letters issued by the other two area nursing home administrators.  <U>Id</U>.  After the
commencement of litigation, HCFA then submitted into evidence copies of the
letters which were written by the other two area nursing home administrators and
which were reviewed by the surveyors on November 17, 1995.  HCFA Exs. 5, 6. 
The letters from the other two nursing home administrators thanked and
complimented Ms. Meyers for her work with them.  <U>Id</U>.   


<P>Even though the HCFA surveyors did not state that Ms. Meyers was the individual
who had provided them with the two letters which complimented her and thanked her
for her work (HCFA Exs. 5, 6), the evidence presented by HCFA leads me to believe
that Ms. Meyers had indeed done so, after having obtained said letters from the area
nursing home administrators.<A HREF="#N_23_"><SUP>(23)</SUP></A>   


<P>For example, even though there is no indication that any area nursing home
administrators had been provided copies of Mr. Niehoff's October 31 letter by either
Mr. Niehoff or Mr. Litwinovich, the letters from the other two area nursing home
administrators (dated November 7 and 8 of 1995) were written shortly after Mr.
Niehoff's October 31 letter would have been received in Mr. Litwinovich's office. 
(HCFA's evidence shows that Mr. Litwinovich and Ms. Meyers have the same office
address.  HCFA Exs. 2, 5.)  One of the two letters complimenting Ms. Meyers was
specifically addressed to her, with no indication that a copy had been sent to anyone
else by its author.  HCFA Ex. 5.  The other letter complimenting Ms. Meyers was
addressed to "To Whom It May Concern" and also contains no indication that a copy
had been sent to anyone by its author.  HCFA Ex. 6.  Additionally, since Ms. Meyers
voluntarily showed the surveyors a copy of Mr. Niehoff's letter criticizing her
professionalism (see HCFA Ex. 30), it seems only logical that she would have
provided also information in her own defense, such as the two favorable letters. 
These circumstances, added to the fact that the surveyors interviewed only Ms.
Meyers, foreclose the likelihood that mere coincidence had caused the two area
administrators to write letters contradicting Mr. Niehoff's allegation that there were
"mutual feelings of disrespect that the three nursing homes in Placerville have toward
Kathryn [sic]."  HCFA Ex. 2 at 2.  Instead, the evidence leads me to believe that Ms.
Meyers was the one who had obtained the letters from the other two area nursing
home administrators and then provided them to the HCFA surveyors for the specific
purpose of refuting Mr. Niehoff's disparagement of her professional reputation.


<P>HCFA's survey report/statement of deficiencies disclosed also that its surveyors had
reviewed the Ombudsman's record of contacts concerning incidents involving Gold
Country's residents.  HCFA Ex. 9 at 1; HCFA Ex. 23; HCFA Ex. 30 at 3-4.  Mr.
Simpson's declaration, submitted by HCFA during litigation, confirms that the
ombudsman's record of contacts was received from Ms. Meyers during the surveyors'
interview of her.  HCFA Ex. 30 at 3-4.  However, the survey report/statement of
deficiency does not indicate how the ombudsman's record of contacts was used to
reach the noncompliance determination.


<P>HCFA's survey report/statement of deficiencies shows that the surveyors reviewed
also Gold Country's incident/accident logs.<A HREF="#N_24_"><SUP>(24)</SUP></A>  HCFA Ex. 9 at 1.  However, HCFA's
survey report/statement of deficiencies does not disclose how the logs were used to
reach the noncompliance determination at issue.


<P>Based on the foregoing facts, I conclude that HCFA reached the noncompliance
determination at issue after having interviewed only Ms. Meyers for the survey and
having reviewed the aforementioned six documents (four of which were provided by
Ms. Meyers) on November 17, 1995. 

<P>	

<P><STRONG>B.  With its notice letter dated December 8, 1995, HCFA disclosed certain
rationale for having found Gold Country out of compliance with 42 C.F.R. §
483.10(g)(2).</STRONG>

<P> 

<P>HCFA sent a notice letter to Gold Country dated December 8, 1995.  HCFA Ex. 10. 
HCFA's December 8 notice letter did not set forth any explanation of the
noncompliance determination made under 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2) (Tag F 168). 
However, HCFA enclosed with its notice letter a copy of the November 17, 1995
survey report/statement of deficiencies (HCFA Ex. 10 at 4<A HREF="#N_25_"><SUP>(25)</SUP></A>) and a document titled
"Directed Plan of Correction, Tag F-168" (HCFA Ex. 10 at 5).  


<P>As I noted earlier, according to the survey report/statement of deficiencies
incorporated by HCFA's December 8, 1995 notice, the surveyors found Gold
Country out of compliance with 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2) due to its failure "to ensure
that residents and their families have access to information from client advocacy
agencies."  HCFA Ex. 9 at 1.  The only rationale discernible from the survey
report/statement of deficiencies consisted of the surveyors' notation concerning
certain sentences from Mr. Niehoff's October 31 letter to Ms. Meyers' superior.  The
HCFA surveyors specifically noted their conclusion that the minutes from the Family
Council's September meeting was not "inflammatory and confrontational" as alleged
in the October 31 letter from Mr. Niehoff to Ms. Meyers' boss, and that the other two
nursing homes' letters concerning Ms. Meyers did not support the allegation in Mr.
Niehoff's October 31 letter concerning her professional status in the area.  <U>Id</U>.  


<P>The HCFA surveyors noted also Mr. Niehoff's statement in his October 31 letter that
"[w]e will not be a part of nor will we support the Ombudsman program by
providing the vehicle whereby they exercise continuing criticism and confrontation." 
HCFA Ex. 9 at 1-2.  However, the survey report/statement of deficiencies does not
contain an explanation of how the foregoing sentence was interpreted by its
surveyors.


<P>The "Directed Plan of Correction, Tag F-168," which was included with HCFA's
notice of December 8, 1995, specifically explained that the actions specified by
HCFA in the plan were "required in order for the provider to come into compliance
with program requirements documented at 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2)."  HCFA Ex. 10
at 5.  The contents of the Directed Plan of Correction imposed by HCFA provides
relevant information concerning HCFA's legal interpretation of 42 C.F.R. §
483.10(g)(2)'s requirements, as well as the significance HCFA has placed on certain
findings of fact made by its surveyors in concluding that Gold Country was out of
compliance with the regulatory requirements.<A HREF="#N_26_"><SUP>(26)</SUP></A>  The Directed Plan required Gold
Country to do as follows by certain deadlines:


<P>	submit a "letter of understanding" to the El Dorado County
Department of Community Services for the purpose of "re-establish[ing] open communications and cooperation with the Long
Term Care Ombudsman program, El Dorado County Department of
Community Services;"


<P>	"ensure that complete and accurate minutes of family and resident
council[<A HREF="#N_27_"><SUP>(27)</SUP></A>]meetings are taken;" 


<P>	immediately resume "mailing Ombudsman materials to families along
with billing or other facility mailings;" 


<P>	and immediately cease "issuing written or other communications
which allegedly represent the opinions of other nursing facilities in
the Placerville area as far as the Ombudsman program is concerned."  


<P>HCFA Ex. 10 at 5.  The contents of this Directed Plan appear also to have resulted
from the contents of Mr. Niehoff's October 31 letter and the surveyors' having found
certain portions of that letter problematic.  The Directed Plan warned that Gold
Country's failure to abide by these directives "will be cause for further HCFA
intervention, which may include decertification for participation in the
Medicare/Medi-Cal programs."  <U>Id</U>.


<P>III.  <U>THE ISSUES OF LAW AND FACT RAISED BY GOLD COUNTRY'S
HEARING REQUEST</U>


<P>After having received HCFA's December 8, 1995 notice of noncompliance
determination and imposition of the "Directed Plan of Correction, Tag F-168,"  Gold
Country filed a hearing request which challenged HCFA's legal interpretation of 42
C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2).  According to Gold Country, this regulation refers only to the
residents' right to contact advocacy agencies concerning the outcome of surveys. 
HCFA Ex. 14 at 2-3.


<P>Additionally, Gold Country disputed HCFA's use of 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2) as a
basis for requiring "the facility to distribute ombudsman materials in monthly
mailings" (HCFA Ex. 14 at 4) and to prohibit Gold Country from "issuing written or
other communications which allegedly represent the opinions of other nursing
facilities in the Placerville area as far as the Ombudsman program is concerned" (<U>id</U>.
at 5, quoting from HCFA's Directed Plan of Correction).<A HREF="#N_28_"><SUP>(28)</SUP></A>  Gold Country reasoned
that it was without any legal obligation to distribute ombudsman materials in its
monthly mailings.  Gold Country contended also that HCFA is unlawfully curtailing
its representatives' right to freedom of speech by prohibiting the issuance of
communications concerning the other area facilities' opinions.  <U>Id</U>.


<P>Gold Country challenged also HCFA's interpretation of Mr. Niehoff's October 31,
1995 letter.  According to Gold Country, said letter to the El Dorado County
Department of Community Services should not have been interpreted as a violation
of 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2) because the letter was "expressing concerns over the
relationship between Gold Country Health Center and one ombudsman
representative[,]" and that it "has also been taken out of context by the HCFA
surveyor" due to the surveyor's unawareness of "previous and continuing
communication between the Corporate Office and the Department of Community
Services."  HCFA Ex. 14 at 3-4.<A HREF="#N_29_"><SUP>(29)</SUP></A>  


<P>For similar reasons, Gold Country challenged also HCFA's conclusion that residents
had been placed at risk.  Gold Country asserted that, even if a violation of 42 C.F.R.
§ 483.10(g)(2) had occurred because it wrote a letter to Ms. Meyers' supervisor, the
violation was isolated and unsupported by any evidence of even potential harm to
residents.  <U>Id</U>. at 4, 5.  According to Gold Country, "[t]he difficulties between the
facility and the ombudsman program are, at most, personality problem."  <U>Id</U>. at 4.



<P>IV.  <U>ADDITIONAL RATIONALE PROVIDED BY HCFA DURING LITIGATION
TO EXPLAIN ITS NONCOMPLIANCE DETERMINATION UNDER 42 C.F.R. §
483.10(g)(2)</U>


<P>As noted previously, the survey report/statement of deficiencies merely noted and
took issue with certain sentences and phrases from Mr. Niehoff's October 31 letter. 
Even though the survey report/statement of deficiencies said the surveyors had
reviewed also the incident/accident log and Ombudsman's record of contacts, as well
as having conducted an interview of Ms. Meyers,<A HREF="#N_30_"><SUP>(30)</SUP></A>
<P> the survey report/statement of
deficiencies did not disclose how these documents were used by the surveyors, the
nature of the information provided by Ms. Meyers, or how these documents and Ms.
Meyers' information were used to reach the noncompliance determination  <U>See</U>
HCFA Ex. 9.  Nor did the survey report/statement of deficiencies explain why a
sentence from Mr. Niehoff's October 31 letter (<U>i.e.</U>, the sentence stating, "[w]e will
not be a part of nor will we support the Ombudsman program by providing the
vehicle whereby they exercise continuing criticism and confrontation.") was quoted
in determining that Gold Country was out of compliance with 42 C.F.R. §
483.10(g)(10).  <U>See</U> HCFA Ex. 9 at 1-2.  


<P>Explanations for the foregoing matters, as well as other information, were provided
by HCFA for the first time in the declaration of HCFA surveyor Kenneth Simpson,
which was executed for these proceedings and filed with HCFA's brief.  


<P>Mr. Simpson's declaration revealed for the first time the substance of the information
provided by Ms. Meyers when she was interviewed by the surveyors on November
17, 1995.  According to Mr. Simpson, Ms. Meyers "related that the administration of
Gold Country had become increasingly hostile toward her and noncooperative with
the Ombudsman's Office in recent weeks."  HCFA Ex. 30 at 3.  



<P>Mr. Simpson stated that he interpreted the tone and content of Mr. Niehoff's October
31 letter as indicating Gold Country's lack of cooperation with the Ombudsman's
program.  HCFA Ex. 30 at 3.  He stated further that Mr. Niehoff's statement that
Gold Country "will not be a part of nor will we support the Ombudsman program by
providing the vehicle whereby they exercise continuing criticism and confrontation"
indicated that Gold Country had established: 


<P>	an adversarial relationship with the Ombudsman's office that was not
conducive to furthering the objectives of the Ombudsman program
(<U>i.e.</U>, identifying, investigating and resolving complaints made by or
on behalf of nursing home residents), and which (at least) threatened
to interfere with communications between the Ombudsman's office
and the residents of the facility.


<P>HCFA Ex. 30 at 3. 


<P>Mr. Simpson explained for the first time in his declaration the manner in which the
surveyors used the ombudsman's record of contacts provided by Ms. Meyers. 
According to Mr. Simpson, the ombudsman's record of contacts showed that, for the
period from June 29 through September 13, 1995, Gold Country had referred six
incidents to her.  HCFA Ex. 30 at 3-4.  The surveyors then showed Gold Country's
incident/accident log for a later period of time (from October 1 to November 8, 1995)
to Ms. Meyers, and Ms. Meyers told the surveyors that not one of the allegations
noted in the later dated logs had been referred to her office.  <U>Id</U>.  According to Mr.
Simpson:  


<P>	[i]n particular, we were concerned that Gold Country's expressions of
hostility toward the Ombudsman and noncooperation with the
Ombudsman's office (as evidenced by the failure to report resident
allegations of abuse, changes in resident condition and resident
grievances[<A HREF="#N_31_"><SUP>(31)</SUP></A>]) limited (or certainly had the potential to limit) the
residents' access to the Ombudsman and, therefore, their ability to
contact and receive information from this official advocacy agency.


<P>HCFA Ex. 30 at 5.<A HREF="#N_32_"><SUP>(32)</SUP></A>

<P> 

<P>Mr. Simpson asserted also in his declaration that the noncompliance determination at
issue did not result only from consideration of the October 31 letter:


<P>	[b]ased on our interview with Ms. Meyers, our reading of the October
31, 1995 letter and the evidence showing that Gold Country failed to
report resident allegations to the Ombudsman's office, the survey team
concluded that the facility was not complying with the requirement at
42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2) . . . . 


<P>HCFA Ex. 30 at 4.  As further explained by Mr. Simpson:


<P>	[a]ccordingly, the survey team cited a violation of 42 C.F.R. §
483.10(g)(2) on the Statement of deficiencies prepared following
completion of the survey, and assessed this deficiency in the "F"
category on the scope and severity matrix (i.e., no actual harm with
potential for more than minimal widespread harm that is not
immediate jeopardy).


<P>HCFA Ex. 30 at 5.


<P>Using Mr. Simpson's declaration, HCFA asserted also for the first time that Gold
Country's Administrator had been apprised at the survey's exit conference<A HREF="#N_33_"><SUP>(33)</SUP></A> of the
surveyors' concerns about the October 31 letter and the failure to report resident
complaints.  According to Mr. Simpson's declaration, "the administrator did not deny
that Gold Country had ceased to cooperate with the Ombudsman's Office."  HCFA
Ex. 30 at 4.  Also according to Mr. Simpson's declaration, "[h]e [the administrator]
offered no explanation for the failure to report to the Ombudsman the incidents
recorded in the resident allegation logs."  <U>Id</U>.


<P>V.  <U>ADDITIONAL ISSUES RAISED BY THE PARTIES AFTER HCFA'S
SUPPLEMENTATION OF ITS NONCOMPLIANCE DETERMINATION
DURING LITIGATION</U>


<P>After receiving and reviewing the declaration of Mr. Simpson submitted by HCFA
with its brief, Gold Country raised challenges to his version of the facts.  Gold
Country asserted, for example, that the HCFA surveyors did not provide Gold
Country with an opportunity to respond to Ms. Meyers' accusations during the survey
process (P. Reply, at 5); nor had HCFA provided notice or an opportunity for Gold
Country to address the newly alleged violation concerning Gold Country's failure to
refer the contents of its incident/accident logs to the ombudsman.  P. Reply, at 10. 
To support the foregoing contentions as well as to refute Mr. Simpson's assertions
that, during the survey exit conference, the facility did not deny its lack of
cooperation with the ombudsman (<U>see</U> HCFA Ex. 30), Gold Country introduced with
its Reply Brief the declarations of its Administrator and Director of Nursing
Services, who had attended this conference with Mr. Simpson.


<P>Both the Administrator and Director of Nursing Services for Gold Country stated in
their declarations that the incident/accident logs were never mentioned by the
surveyors during the exit conference on November 17, 1995.  P. Exs. 13, 14. 
Moreover, both described Mr. Simpson as hostile, angry, threatening, and
unreasonable on the ombudsman issue during the exit conference. <U>Id</U>.  Both stated
that, when Gold Country's Administrator asked what F Tag Mr. Niehoff's October 31
letter had violated, Mr. Simpson told them he did not know but would find one.  <U>Id</U>. 
Both of these Gold Country officials expressed the view that they were not provided
with the opportunity to address the ombudsman issue or the incident/accident log
issue at the exit conference.  <U>Id</U>.  


<P>After reviewing the foregoing arguments and evidence from Gold Country, HCFA
filed a motion to strike those arguments and evidence.  HCFA's letter dated
September 29, 1997.  In the alternative, HCFA asked for the opportunity to file a
responsive brief.  <U>Id</U>. at 2.   


<P>VI.  <U>DISPOSITION OF OUTSTANDING MOTION AND ISSUES OF LAW</U> 


<P><STRONG>A.  I deny HCFA's motion to strike or to file an additional brief responsive to
Gold Country's due process arguments and to Gold Country's evidence refuting
Mr. Simpson's sworn statements.</STRONG>


<P>HCFA does not want me to consider the declarations and arguments filed by Gold
Country to refute Mr. Simpson's sworn statements.  By letter to me dated September
29, 1997, HCFA argued that Gold Country's denial of "due process" arguments, as
well as the supporting evidence submitted by Gold Country, are "new matters"
improperly submitted with a reply brief.  Therefore, HCFA requested that I either
strike or disregard these "new matters" or allow HCFA to file a responsive brief to
them.


<P>The subject matters of Gold Country's arguments and supporting declarations were
not new to HCFA, since HCFA had raised those very matters by submitting the
declaration of Mr. Simpson dated August 20, 1997 with its own brief.  When Mr.
Simpson's declaration was filed by HCFA, HCFA itself introduced the new and
heretofore undisclosed information concerning how Gold Country's incident/accident
logs were used in the survey, as well as how Gold Country's administrator had
allegedly conducted himself during the exit conference with Mr. Simpson.  HCFA
should have expected a response by Gold Country when it began to add information
which was not contained in its notice letter to Gold Country, the survey
report/statement of deficiencies, the Directed Plan of Correction, or in any of the
exhibits earlier filed in this case.



<P>I do not find it necessary or appropriate to give HCFA any additional chance to
address the foregoing matters.<A HREF="#N_34_"><SUP>(34)</SUP></A>  Both HCFA and Mr. Simpson had the opportunity
to state what they wanted to, and in as complete a manner as they wished, when they
decided to raise these new facts.


<P>Moreover, resolution of disputes concerning these matters would not significantly
affect my finding that HCFA has failed to present a prima facie case under 42 C.F.R.
§ 483.10(g)(2).  I note, for example, that Gold Country does not deny that it did not
report complaints from its incident/accident logs to Ms. Meyers.  Gold Country
disagrees only with Mr. Simpson's contention that the issue of the incident/accident
log was brought to its attention during the survey's exit conference.  For the reasons I
will discuss elsewhere in this Decision, I conclude that the reporting of residents'
complaints to the ombudsman was not required by 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2) on the
basis of the evidence presented by HCFA.  


<P>For similar reasons, I do not find it necessary in this case to reach the question of
whether Mr. Simpson had conducted the exit conference with a closed mind and bias
against the facility, as suggested by Gold Country's counter-declarations.  Even if
Gold Country had been denied the opportunity to set forth its position during the exit
conference concerning Mr. Niehoff's October 31 letter, for example, Gold Country
has set forth its position on this matter in its hearing request and in other documents
reviewed by HCFA.  HCFA Exs. 14, 11.  Since reviewing those documents from
Gold Country, HCFA has not altered its determination of noncompliance under 42
C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2), except to provide additional allegations and explanations in
further support of its conclusions.  As I discuss below, it is the substance of the
evidence presented by HCFA -- without regard for how, when, or why the evidence
was gathered -- which fails to sustain HCFA's "burden of coming forward with
evidence related to disputed findings that is sufficient (together with any undisputed
findings and relevant legal authority) to establish a prima facie case that HCFA had a
legally sufficient basis" for finding Gold Country out of compliance with 42 C.F.R. §
483.10(g)(2).  <U>See</U> <U>Hillman</U> at 8.     

<P>	

<P><STRONG>B.  I reject Gold Country's arguments that, as a matter of law, noncompliance
with 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2) cannot be proven unless HCFA has used evidence
relating only to the residents' examination of survey results.  </STRONG>


<P>The parties disagree as to how broadly 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2) should be
interpreted, given that HCFA does not allege that Gold Coast was out of compliance
with 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(1).  As I noted in discussing the contents of its hearing
request, Gold Country contends that in order for HCFA to establish noncompliance
under 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2), HCFA's evidence must relate only to the residents'
right to examine survey results.  In this case, HCFA did not rely on evidence
specifically involving the residents' examination of survey results.    

<P>The regulation codified as 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g) states as follows in its entirety:

<P>  

<P>	(g) <U>Examination of survey results</U>.  A resident has the right to --<U></U>


<P>			(1) Examine the results of the most recent survey of
the facility conducted by Federal or State surveyors
and any plan of correction in effect with respect to
the facility.  The facility must make the results
available for examination in a place readily
accessible to residents, and must post a notice of
their availability; and


<P>			(2) Receive information from agencies acting as
client advocates, and be afforded the opportunity to
contact these agencies.


<P>42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g).


<P>Gold Country argues that 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2) should be interpreted consistently
with the general subject heading of "Examination of survey results."<A HREF="#N_35_"><SUP>(35)</SUP></A>   Therefore,
Gold Country interprets 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2) to mean only that a facility's
residents have the right to receive information from, and to contact, client advocate
agencies concerning the examination of survey results.  Under this limiting
interpretation, 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2) would become merely the method by which
residents exercise their right under 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(1).


<P>HCFA disagrees.  In response to Gold Country's legal arguments,<A HREF="#N_36_"><SUP>(36)</SUP></A> HCFA contends
that 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2) should be interpreted as entitling residents to receive
information from, as well as to contact, client advocate agencies even in matters
which do not relate to the examination of survey results.  HCFA's arguments rely
primarily upon the plain language of (g)(2).  


<P>I conclude for the following reasons that 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2) means that the
residents' right to contact and receive information from client advocate agencies is
not limited to matters relating to their right to examine survey results.   


<P>In listing those requirements which skilled nursing facilities must meet in order to
participate in the Medicare program, Congress created certain rights for such
facilities' residents, and it specified that the facilities must protect and promote those
rights.  Social Security Act (Act), section 1819(c).  The examination of survey results
is one such resident right created by Congress.  Act, section 1819(c)(1)(A)(ix). 
Therefore, it follows that the implementing regulations promulgated by the Secretary
of Health and Human Services (Secretary) must give effect to this right explicitly
created by statute.  This statutory right was set forth in the portion of the regulation
codified as 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(1).  


<P>However, in addition to having created specified rights for residents, Congress
conferred broad discretion upon the Secretary to establish "[a]ny other rights" for
residents which must also be protected and promoted by the facilities.  Act, sections
1819(c)(1)(A)(xi).  <U>See</U> <U>also</U>, Act, sections 1819(d)(4)(B), 1919(d)(4)(B).<A HREF="#N_37_"><SUP>(37)</SUP></A>  The
Secretary has stated by regulation that the statutory bases for her Part 483 regulations
include sections 1819(c) and (d) of the Act.  42 C.F.R. § 483.1(a)(1).  Therefore, in
promulgating 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g), the Secretary did not need to confine herself to
giving effect only to the residents' right under the Act to examine survey results.  


<P>Given its plain meaning, 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2) is consistent with the Secretary's
authority to create other rights for residents and place corresponding obligations
upon the facilities participating in the programs.  Even if resort to regulatory history
were appropriate in the absence of any ambiguous language in the regulation itself,
interpreting 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2) in accordance with its plain meaning is
supported by the fact that the Secretary's explanations of her proposed regulation
used words which nearly duplicate those of the regulation.<A HREF="#N_38_"><SUP>(38)</SUP></A>  56 Fed. Reg. 48,832
(1991).  The Secretary's explanations of her proposed regulation also stated that she
was amending section 483.10(b)(7) to require the facility to include in its written
notice to residents the name, mailing address, and telephone number of relevant
advocacy agencies, in order that residents may exercise their right of contact under
section 483.10(g)(2).  56 Fed. Reg. 48,832 (1991).  There was no identification of
any particular purpose for these contacts.


<P>Without doubt, residents have the right under 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2) to contact
their client advocate agencies and receive information concerning survey results,
especially since those agencies are entitled to obtain directly from the surveying
entities any report of enforcement remedies imposed against facilities.  <U>See</U> 42 C.F.R.
§ 488.325(f).  Therefore, the regulation's general heading of "Examination of survey
results" is not inappropriate to the broader interpretation that, under 42 C.F.R. §
483.10(g)(2), residents may contact and receive information from their client
advocate agencies concerning any matter -- including the examination of survey
results.     


<P>For the foregoing reasons, I reject Gold Country's conclusion that in order for HCFA
to establish noncompliance under 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2), HCFA's evidence must
relate only to the residents' right to examine survey results.   


<P><STRONG>C.  I dismiss Gold Country's challenge to the noncompliance determination
made by HCFA under F Tag 329 or 42 C.F.R. § 483.25(l)(1).</STRONG>


<P>In my earlier rulings, I had noted that Gold Country should withdraw also its
challenge to the noncompliance findings HCFA made under F Tag 329 (42 C.F.R. §
483.25(l)(1)) because those findings did not lead to the imposition of any remedy by
HCFA against Gold Country.  Feb. 11, 1997 Ruling, at 7, n.2, and at 10; June 20,
1997 Ruling, at 4, n.3.  Gold Country has not done so formally, even though it has
not taken exception to my conclusion that no hearing rights exist under 42 C.F.R. §
498.3(b)(12) with respect to F Tag 329.  Therefore, in order to eliminate any
ambiguity which may exist at present, I am holding that I have no authority to
consider any disputes Gold Country might have wished to raise concerning the
noncompliance findings made by HCFA under F Tag 329.  My rationale is contained
in my prior rulings (Feb. 11, 1997 Ruling and June 20, 1997 Ruling) and is the same
as those I discussed in allowing Gold Country to withdraw its challenge to F Tag 272
(42 C.F.R. § 483.20(b)) while maintaining the present action against HCFA on the
basis of HCFA's noncompliance determination under 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2) or F
Tag 168.  Accordingly, all issues concerning 42 C.F.R. § 483.25(l)(1) are hereby
dismissed from this case pursuant to 42 C.F.R. § 498.70(b). 


<P>VII.  <U>HCFA'S FAILURE TO ESTABLISH A PRIMA FACIE CASE UNDER 42
C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2)</U>


<P><STRONG>A.  To establish its prima facie case, HCFA's evidence for each of the disputed
issues must be material to the requirements of 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2) and be
sufficient to lead reasonably, credibly, and logically to the conclusions that, as of
the November 17, 1995 survey, Gold Country had acted, or failed to act, in a
manner that was contrary to the requirements of 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2), and,
as a consequence, its residents' health or safety were placed at risk for more
than minimal harm.</STRONG>  


<P>HCFA must "com[e] forward with evidence related to disputed findings that is
sufficient (together with any undisputed findings and relevant legal authority) to
establish a prima facie case that HCFA had a legally sufficient basis" for the sanction
it imposed.  <U>Hillman</U> at 8.  In deciding that HCFA has the burden of coming forward
with evidence establishing a prima facie case that Hillman substantially failed to
comply with program requirements, the Appellate Panel explained that HCFA's
determination to sanction the provider "must be legally sufficient under the statute
and regulations."  <U>Hillman</U> at 11.  I interpret the foregoing requirements, together
with the very definition of "prima facie," to mean that the facts on which HCFA
relies (assuming that they will not be disproven by the facility) should provide
sufficient support for each of the disputed material findings or determinations made
by HCFA, and that, moreover, said findings or determinations stem from a proper
interpretation of the applicable laws and regulations.  <U>See</U> <U>Hillman</U> at 8, 11.  At
minimum, the body of evidence introduced by HCFA should not contain substantial
conflicts <U>inter</U> <U>se</U> or give rise to material questions of fact, the evidence should appear
credible on its face, and the evidence should lead reasonably and persuasively to the
factual conclusions urged by HCFA.  The factual conclusions urged by HCFA must,
in turn, establish that the requisite legal and regulatory elements have been satisfied.   
  


<P>For this case, I take notice that, effective on July 1, 1995, the regulations which
implemented the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987, as amended in 1988,
1989, and 1990, have made inapplicable to skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) and
nursing facilities (NFs) the pre-existing hierarchical scheme of conditions of
participation, standards, and elements.  59 Fed. Reg. 56,116; 56,173 (1994). 
Effective on July 1, 1995, the regulation applicable to SNFs and NFs defines
"noncompliance" as "any <U>deficiency</U> that causes a facility to <U>not be in substantial
compliance</U>."  42 C.F.R. § 488.301 (emphasis added).  "<U>Deficiency</U>" means "a SNF's
or NF's failure to meet a participation requirement <U>specified in</U> the Act or in part 483,
subpart B of this chapter."  <U>Id</U>.<A HREF="#N_39_"><SUP>(39)</SUP></A> (emphasis added).  A facility is in "<U>substantial
compliance</U>" if it has "a level of compliance with the requirements of participation
such that any identified deficiencies pose no greater risk to resident health or safety
than the potential for causing minimal harm."  <U>Id</U>.  Therefore, I interpret
"noncompliance" to mean the existence of one or more deficiencies (<U>i.e.</U>, the failure
to meet one or more specified participation requirements) which poses greater risk to
residents' health or safety than the potential for causing minimal harm.    


<P>Moreover, notice of the final rule states in explanation that deficiencies "take on
greater or lesser significance depending on the circumstances and resident outcomes
in a particular facility."  59 Fed. Reg. 56,173 (1994).  The Notice states also, "[w]e . .
. are allowing violations of any participation requirement, including resident rights . .
., to be assessed at any degree of seriousness."  59 Fed. Reg. 56,165 (1994). 
However, a facility would not be required to submit even a plan of correction for
approval by HCFA or the state survey agency "when it has deficiencies that are
isolated and have a potential for minimal harm, but no actual harm has occurred."  42
C.F.R. § 488.402(d)(2).  Enforcement remedies are authorized only if survey
findings show that a facility's deficiencies are at the level of "noncompliance."  <U>See</U>
42 C.F.R. §§ 488.402(b), 488.408.


<P>For the foregoing reasons, I conclude that, in order to support its "noncompliance"
determination, HCFA must first have evidence which establishes that the facility has
failed to conduct itself in the manner mandated by the applicable regulation.  (A
deficiency under a given regulation is, in essence, a deviation by the facility from the
duty imposed upon it by that regulation.)  Only if a deficiency has been established
with adequate evidence that is legally relevant to the elements of the regulation may
HCFA then proceed to the question of whether or to what degree residents' health or
safety has been placed at risk as a result of the deficiency.  By itself, risk to residents'
health or safety cannot establish the existence of noncompliance with any given
participation requirement.     

<P>   

<P>Below, I will apply these principles to analyze the three categories of evidence
HCFA and its surveyor claim to have relied upon to reach the noncompliance
determination at issue: (1) the contents of Mr. Niehoff's October 31 letter;<A HREF="#N_40_"><SUP>(40)</SUP></A> (2) the
statements provided by Ms. Meyers; (3) the evidence that Gold Country did not
report resident allegations to the Ombudsman's office.  <U>See</U> HCFA Ex. 30 at 4-5.


<P><STRONG>B.  HCFA's evidence shows that it has given improper, unreasonable, or
unfounded interpretations to Mr. Niehoff's October 31, 1995 letter and Mr.
Litwinovich's return letter dated November 15, 1995, as support for its
determination that Gold Country was out of compliance with 42 C.F.R. §
483.10(g)(2).</STRONG>


<P>	1.  <U>HCFA's awareness that its surveyors had failed to evaluate the
context in which Mr. Niehoff wrote his letter dated October 31, 1995</U>

<P>	

<P>As noted above, HCFA's survey report/statement of deficiencies focused on the
contents of Mr. Niehoff's October 31, 1995 letter in determining that Gold Country
was out of compliance with the requirements of 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2).  Gold
Country used its hearing request to contest, <U>inter</U> <U>alia</U>, the use HCFA had made of this 
letter.  


<P>In these proceedings, HCFA does not dispute Gold Country's assertions that other
relevant correspondence between Mr. Niehoff and the El Dorado County Department
of Community Services were never reviewed by the surveyors when they found Gold
Country out of compliance with 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2).  Nor is there any genuine
dispute that other relevant correspondence exists.  HCFA itself submitted Mr.
Niehoff's October 31 letter, which began with the following two sentences: 


<P>	[s]ince your letter of September 6, 1995 . . . I have not been able to
continue our dialogue with regard to the relationship between the
Ombudsman program and Gold Country.


<P>	Gold Country and Retirement Housing Foundation continue to have
concerns and reservations about the role of the Ombudsman, and
specifically, Kathryn [sic] Meyers' attitude and relationship toward
Gold Country.


<P>HCFA Ex. 2 at 1.  HCFA has not objected to Gold Country's introduction of other
letters which were exchanged prior to October 31, 1995 between Mr. Niehoff and
Mr. Litwinovich, the Director of the El Dorado County Department of Community
Services.  <U>See</U> P. Exs. 5, 6, 7.


<P>	2.  <U>HCFA's inadequately supported and improper interpretations of
Mr. Niehoff's October 31, 1995 letter and Mr. Litwinovich's response
letter dated November 15, 1995, which were introduced into evidence
by HCFA</U>


<P>After Gold Country's hearing request specifically challenged the noncompliance
determination on the bases that Mr. Niehoff's October 31 letter related to complaints
against only one individual ombudsman and that said letter was interpreted out of
context by the surveyors, HCFA then introduced into evidence the letter written by
Mr. Litwinovich on November 15, 1995, which responded to Mr. Niehoff's October
31 letter.  <U>See</U> HCFA Ex. 8.  However, HCFA relies on Mr. Litwinovich's November
15 letter to argue that Mr. Litwinovich "[c]learly . . . read the October 31 [letter] as a
broad attack on <U>the Ombudsman's program</U> which threatened to disrupt normal
relations between the Ombudsman and the residents -- not simply a narrow objection
to mailing notes of Family Council meetings."  HCFA Br., at 15 (emphasis added).  


<P>This argument is consistent with HCFA's other efforts during these proceedings to
interpret Mr. Niehoff's October 31 letter as something significantly more than mere
criticisms of one individual ombudsman.  For example, HCFA submitted the
declaration of Mr. Simpson, who explained that he made the noncompliance
determination at issue because the "tone and content" of Mr. Niehoff's October 31
letter "indicated to me that Gold Country was not cooperating with <U>the Ombudsman
program</U>."  HCFA Ex. 30 at 3 (emphasis added).  Additionally, HCFA has decided
recently to present the declaration of Ms. Meyers, who stated, "[w]hen I first read
this letter [i.e., Mr. Niehoff's October 31 letter] in November 1995[,] I interpreted it
as another attempt to discredit me in my capacity as Ombudsman <U>and as an
expression of Gold Country's resolve not to cooperate with the work of my office</U>." 
HCFA Ex. 29 at 2 (emphasis added); HCFA Br., at 8-9.  


<P>I do not find the foregoing conclusions urged by HCFA to be adequately supported
by its evidence.  In later sections of this Decision, I will set forth my analysis of the
relevant regulatory elements and explain why HCFA cannot engraft onto 42 C.F.R. §
483.10(g)(2) the requirement that Gold Country cooperate with, or advance the goals
of, the ombudsman program in a manner specified by HCFA.  Here, I am focusing
on the manner in which HCFA formulated its invalid contentions that Mr. Niehoff's
October 31, 1995 letter expressed Gold Country's attack on, and refusal to cooperate
with, the ombudsman's program.    


<P>There is no evidence that HCFA had interviewed either Mr. Niehoff or Mr.
Litwinovich in formulating its opinion that Mr. Niehoff's October 31, 1995 letter was
expressing more than Gold Country's criticisms of one individual ombudsman.<A HREF="#N_41_"><SUP>(41)</SUP></A> 
HCFA's evidence also does not indicate any effort to ascertain from Mr. Litwinovich
his views on what would be considered accepted protocol for a facility to follow if it
has disagreements with or criticisms of an individual ombudsman.  HCFA's evidence
does not show that its surveyors who conducted the November 17, 1995 survey of
Gold Country had any knowledge of, experience in, or expertise with the methods
used by any ombudsman's office for handling complaints concerning its employees. 
HCFA Ex. 24.       

<P>   

<P>Even more significant is HCFA's reliance on the isolated use of selected phrases and
sentences, which are not in accord with the fuller text of the document, in order to
support its conclusion that Mr. Niehoff's October 31, 1995 letter was expressing
Gold Country's refusal to cooperate with the ombudsman program.  I will discuss as 

<P>examples the uses made by HCFA of certain sentences from the following three
paragraphs of Mr. Niehoff's October 31 letter:


<P>	[l]ast month we sent out the Family Council agenda and minutes with
our billing statement.  We also enclosed a response to the minutes
because we found these documents to be inflammatory and
confrontational.  We will not be a part of nor will we support the
Ombudsman program by providing the vehicle whereby they exercise
continuing criticism and confrontation.  Therefore, Gold Country
withdraws its offer to disseminate Ombudsman material and will not
provide mailing addresses, as this information is confidential.


<P>	It disappoints us that our relationship with the Ombudsman program
has deteriorated to such a low level.  While I can appreciate your need
to support the Ombudsman program, I'm not sure you fully
understand the mutual feelings of disrespect that the three nursing
homes in Placerville have toward Kathryn [sic].


<P>	El Dorado County's Ombudsman program is not typical of other such
programs around the state or in the country for that matter.  Most
programs work in a cooperative relationship to improve service or to
resolve issues in a professional manner.  My concern is that it will be
a long time before we can re-establish a positive working relationship
with your Ombudsman program.


<P>HCFA Ex. 2 at 2.  


<P>However, in the survey report/statement of deficiencies, HCFA's surveyors quoted
only the sentence stating "[w]e will not be a part of nor will we support the
Ombudsman program by providing the vehicle whereby they exercise continuing
criticism and confrontation" when they concluded that "the facility failed to ensure
that residents and their families have access to information from client advocacy
agencies."  HCFA Ex. 9 at 1-2.<A HREF="#N_42_"><SUP>(42)</SUP></A>
<P>  

<P>In the brief HCFA submitted to argue the validity of its noncompliance
determination, HCFA has omitted certain key words and context from the above-quoted paragraphs, as well as altered the sequence of Mr. Niehoff's discussions, in
order to present the following to me as HCFA's interpretation of what Mr. Niehoff's
October 31 letter stated:


<P>	[i]n the letter, petitioner admits that its "relationship with the
Ombudsman program has deteriorated to . . . a low level," and that it
no longer has a "working relationship" with that program.  The letter
goes on to express the facility's determination to withdraw its support
from the Ombudsman program specifically by refusing to disseminate
"Ombudsman material."


<P>HCFA Br., at 8.  I do not find HCFA's expurgated and out-of-sequence version of
selected sentences to have properly or fairly conveyed the tone and content of Mr.
Niehoff's letter. 


<P>HCFA does not acknowledge that most of Mr. Niehoff's October 31 letter sets forth
complaints about Ms. Meyers' work and attitudes.  Nor does HCFA acknowledge
that Mr. Niehoff's October 31 letter was regretting the deteriorated relationship
between Ms. Meyers and Gold Country which was, according to Mr. Niehoff's letter,
caused by Ms. Meyers' work and attitude. 



<P>The earlier portion of the letter not relied upon by HCFA stated, for example, the
following complaints about Ms. Meyers: 


<P>	Gold Country and Retirement Housing Foundation continue to have
concerns and reservations about the role of the Ombudsman, and
specifically, Kathryn [sic] Meyer's attitude and relationship toward
Gold Country.  Kathryn [sic] does not deal in terms of reality and is
confrontational in her approach to problem solution.  She tends to
"stir up the pot" with the Family Council, which itself is made up of
individuals who are influenced by Kathryn's [sic] leadership.  When
only three or four family representatives show up for these meetings,
they hardly speak for the majority, but do create concern because,
again, Kathryn [sic] encourages confrontation.  This is not the way to
resolve issues, and only ends up creating animosity between the staff
and the Ombudsman program.


<P>	. . .  


<P>	If we can't provide the training, then we will not have sufficient staff
to provide resident services.  Ultimately, this scenario leads to
inadequate care, loss of occupancy, and bankruptcy.  Is this Kathryn's
[sic] mission?


<P>HCFA Ex. 2 at 1.


<P>Mr. Niehoff also stated towards the end of his October 31, 1995 letter that "[i]t
disappoints us that our relationship with the Ombudsman program has deteriorated to
such a low level[,]" and "El Dorado County's Ombudsman program is not typical of
other such programs around the state or in the country for that matter [because]
[m]ost programs work in a cooperative relationship to improve services or to resolve
issues in a professional manner."  HCFA Ex. 2 at 2.  However, these comments
concerning the ombudsman program stemmed directly from the criticisms of Ms.
Meyers' allegedly confrontational approaches and the animosity she had allegedly
created between Gold Country's staff and the ombudsman's office.  By the time Mr.
Niehoff was making these statements concerning the ombudsman's program after
having provided extensive criticisms of Ms. Meyers' work, Mr. Niehoff was saying,
in essence, that Ms. Meyers' actions and attitudes have eroded the relationship Gold
Country used to have with the ombudsman's program, and her actions and attitudes
have caused the ombudsman's program she represents to operate atypically -- without
extending to Gold Country the cooperation and efforts to resolve issues
professionally which were being extended by other ombudsman programs to other
facilities.  


<P>Mr. Niehoff also asserted in his letter, "[w]e will not be a part of nor will we support
the Ombudsman program by providing the vehicle whereby they exercise continuing
criticism and confrontation[,]" and "[t]herefore, Gold Country withdraws its offer to
disseminate Ombudsman material . . . ."  HCFA Ex. 2 at 2.  However, these
statements are related to the letter's earlier stated complaints that Ms. Meyers "stir[s]
up the pot" with the Family Council and encourages confrontation at the Family
Council meetings even when only three or four family representatives are in
attendance.  <U>See</U> HCFA Ex. 2 at 1.  In context, the "Ombudsman material" referenced
in the letter appear to be those agenda and minutes for the Family Council meetings
at which Ms. Meyers was allegedly "stir[ring] the pot" and encouraging
confrontation by a minority of individuals.<A HREF="#N_43_"><SUP>(43)</SUP></A>  <U>See</U> HCFA Ex. 2.


<P>For these reasons, I conclude that HCFA has given an unreasonable and incomplete
reading of Mr. Niehoff's October 31, 1995 letter, in order to contend that Gold
Country was refusing to cooperate with the ombudsman's program in a manner
alleged to be unlawful by HCFA.  While it is regrettable for Gold Country that Mr.
Niehoff had used some intemperate phrases in his letter, HCFA acted improperly by
focusing on those phrases in isolation.  


<P>Similarly, a fair and full reading of all that Mr. Litwinovich said in his response letter
dated November 15, 1995 (HCFA Ex. 8) would not lead to HCFA's overbroad
conclusion that Mr. Litwinovich also viewed Mr. Niehoff's letter "as a broad attack
on the Ombudsman's program which threatened to disrupt normal relations between
the Ombudsman and the residents. . . ." (HCFA Br., at 15).<A HREF="#N_44_"><SUP>(44)</SUP></A>  Nor would the fact that
Mr. Niehoff addressed his complaints about Ms. Meyers' conduct and motives to Ms.
Meyers' boss -- without having provided copies of this letter to anyone other than
Gold Country's administrator and RHF's Corporate Nursing Consultant (HCFA Ex. 2
at 2) -- lead reasonably to Ms. Meyers' interpreting the letter as another attempt "to
discredit me in my capacity as Ombudsman and as an expression of Gold Country's
resolve not to cooperate with the work of my office."  HCFA Ex. 29 at 2.<A HREF="#N_45_"><SUP>(45)</SUP></A>  


<P>Mr. Litwinovich's letter shows that he had considered and investigated the
allegations made by Mr. Neihoff.  Even though he was in disagreement with the
conclusions drawn by Mr. Niehoff concerning Ms. Meyers' conduct, Mr. Litwinovich
did not indicate that Mr. Niehoff or his organization was without the right to bring
such allegations to the ombudsman's office for inquiry.  I note, for example, that Mr.
Litwinovich closed his letter with the statement, "[w]e remain available to discuss
these or other issues as may be helpful."  HCFA Ex. 8 at 2.  


<P>	3.  <U>Additional aspects of Mr. Litwinovich's November 15, 1995
response letter (introduced into evidence by HCFA) which further
undercuts HCFA's attempt to establish a prima facie case</U>


<P>In addition to the foregoing problems with HCFA's evidence, its introduction of Mr.
Litwinovich's November 15 response letter raises a material factual issue which it
has left unaddressed: what did Gold Country do after it received Mr. Litwinovich's
response letter?  Mr. Litwinovich's response letter dated November 15, 1995
contained specific suggestions for resolving Gold Country's concerns for mailing the
Family Council minutes,<A HREF="#N_46_"><SUP>(46)</SUP></A> informed Mr. Niehoff that the other nursing home
administrators failed to share his low opinion of Ms. Meyers' professionalism and
represented that Ms. Meyers had been advised of Mr. Litwinovich's expectations of
her work after he had held a lengthy discussion with her regarding Gold Country's
concerns.  HCFA Ex. 8.  


<P>What Gold Country did after receiving Mr. Litwinovich's November 15, 1995 letter
is material and should have been accounted for by HCFA because this issue was
raised by the contents of said November 15 letter introduced into evidence by HCFA. 
What Gold Country did after receiving Mr. Litwinovich's November 15 response
letter has bearing on the correctness of HCFA's determination that Gold Country was
out of compliance with 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2) as of the November 17, 1995
survey date.  Additionally, the issue of what Gold Country did after receiving the
November 15 letter is material also because HCFA's evidence establishes that HCFA
considered Gold Country's alleged noncompliance with 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2) to
have been ongoing even after the survey of November 17, 1995; otherwise, HCFA
would not have found it necessary to impose the "Directed Plan of Correction, Tag
F-168" as a remedy with its notice letter of December 8, 1995.  Moreover, Gold
Country's hearing request challenged HCFA's determination that the matters relating
to or contained in Mr. Niehoff's October 31 letter were not isolated deficiencies with
a potential for only minimal harm to residents.<A HREF="#N_47_"><SUP>(47)</SUP></A>  HCFA Ex. 14, at 4.  As explained
by HCFA surveyor, Kenneth Simpson, Gold Country's violation was cited at the
Scope and Severity level of F which meant, "no actual harm with potential for more
than minimal widespread harm that is not immediate jeopardy."  HCFA Ex. 30 at 5.  

<P>  

<P>However, after introducing Mr. Litwinovich's November 15, 1995 letter into
evidence, HCFA has presented nothing to indicate that Gold Country continued to
take any of the actions which HCFA's surveyors had found to be objectionable or
improper from Mr. Niehoff's October 31, 1995 letter.  For example, HCFA has not
attempted to show that Gold Country had continued to complain of Ms. Meyers'
attitude and professionalism after it was apprised by Mr. Litwinovich's letter that Mr.
Litwinovich and other area nursing home administrators did not share in the
criticisms of Ms. Meyers' work.  There is also no evidence from HCFA showing that
after Mr. Litwinovich's letter was received, Gold Country or Mr. Niehoff was
unwilling to meet with the Ombudsman's Office as suggested by Mr. Litwinovich in
order to resolve concerns that the Family Council minutes were becoming a
"negative public relations device . . . ."  HCFA Ex. 8 at 1.  HCFA's evidence
indicates that no consideration had been given to such matters when it determined
that Gold Country was out of compliance with 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2) as of the
November 17, 1995 survey date.


<P>Of course HCFA was within its discretion to commence a resurvey of Gold Country
on November 17, 1995.  <U>See</U> 42 C.F.R. § 488.20(b)(1).  During the resurvey, HCFA
had the authority to investigate also an unrelated complaint brought to its attention. 
However, there exists no regulation which required HCFA to complete any type of
survey on the same day that it was begun.  Nor do the regulations prohibit the
surveyors from interviewing more than one witness during a complaint survey, or
limit the number of documents they may review.  Here, HCFA has submitted no
evidence to show that the quantity or quality of evidence it gathered for 42 C.F.R. §
483.10(g)(2) on the single day of survey resulted from its surveyors' adherence to
established protocols for investigating complaints of this type.  In the absence of
such evidence from HCFA, it is reasonable to expect its surveyors to have conducted
a more comprehensive survey of greater depth (<U>e.g.</U>, interviewed more than one
witness (Ms. Meyers), interpreted Mr. Niehoff's letter in context, considered the
response letter of Mr. Litwinovich, and inquired into Gold Country's subsequent
course of action) before concluding that noncompliance of a widespread scope was
continuing to exist at Gold Country as of November 17, 1995.  Even though I cannot
direct the manner in which HCFA chooses to conduct its surveys, I note that the
choices made by HCFA when it surveyed Gold Country on November 17, 1995 have
impacted adversely on the amount and quality of evidence it is able to present.  The
limitations in HCFA's evidence have, in turn, detracted from the soundness or
reasonableness of its conclusions.        


<P><STRONG>C.  HCFA has given an improper legal interpretation of 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2)
in its use of Mr. Niehoff's October 31, 1995 letter as evidence of Gold Country's
noncompliance due to its lack of cooperation, lack of open communication, or
development of an adversarial relationship with the ombudsman's office.</STRONG>

<P> 

<P>The Directed Plan of Correction introduced into evidence by HCFA shows that
HCFA is requiring "open communications" and "cooperation" between Gold Country
and the ombudsman program in order for Gold Country to come into compliance
with 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2).  HCFA Ex. 10 at 5, para. 1.  For the reasons discussed
previously, I view the contents of the Directed Plan of Correction as relevant
evidence of the legal interpretation HCFA has given to 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2).  


<P>Additionally, the evidence and arguments presented by HCFA also lead to the
conclusion that HCFA interprets 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2) as including those
requirements for "open communications" and "cooperation" reflected by the
"Directed Plan of Correction, Tag F-168."  Mr. Simpson, the HCFA surveyor,
explained in his declaration that he was particularly concerned with Mr. Niehoff's
statement that Gold Country "will not be a part of nor will we support the
Ombudsman program by providing the vehicle whereby they exercise continuing
criticism and confrontation" (HCFA Ex. 2 at 2) because "[t]his statement indicated to
me that Gold Country had established an adversarial relationship with the
Ombudsman's office that was not conducive to furthering the objectives of the
Ombudsman's program . . . ."  HCFA Ex. 30 at 3.  With its brief, HCFA also
submitted the declaration of Ms. Meyers, who alleged also that Mr. Niehoff's
October 31, 1995 letter was an "attempt to rationalize Gold Country's
noncooperation with the Ombudsman program . . . ."  HCFA Ex. 29 at 2.  In an
earlier filed motion, HCFA explained that the facility was found out of compliance
with 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2): 


<P>	because they were on record as declining to cooperate with the
ombudsman program, thus having the potential for affecting all of the
residents in the facility, with a scope and severity level of "F" on the
Grid (which is attached as HCFA Ex. 27), <U>i.e</U>., a widespread potential
for more than minimal harm that is not immediate jeopardy, with no
actual harm (F 168) . . . .


<P>HCFA Mot. to Dism., at 1-2.  HCFA, by its Associate Regional Administrator for the
Division of Health Standards and Quality, stated also in her declaration that the
deficiency HCFA considered to have been most significant and purposeful was
"Gold Country's explicit refusal to cooperate with the State Ombudsman program." 
Declaration of Janice M. Caldwell at 3, attached to HCFA Renewed Mot. to Dism.


<P>I find that no deviation from (or deficiencies under) the requirements of 42 C.F.R. §
483.10(g)(2) was established by HCFA's evidence concerning Gold Country's
allegedly adversarial relationship with the ombudsman's office, by Gold Country's
alleged failure to advance the objectives of the ombudsman's program, or by Gold
Country's alleged failure to cooperate or communicate openly with the ombudsman's
office.           


<P>The relevant words of this regulation make clear that the residents -- and not the
ombudsman or the ombudsman's office -- are the ones who hold the rights specified
therein:


<P>	<U>A resident has the right to:</U>


<P>			Receive information from agencies acting as client
advocates, and be afforded the opportunity to
contact these agencies.


<P>42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2)(emphasis added).  


<P>Additionally, any open communication guaranteed by this regulation is between the
ombudsman's office (or the ombudsman) and the residents of a facility.  This
particular regulation does not mandate communication of any type between the
facility and the ombudsman's office (or the ombudsman).<A HREF="#N_48_"><SUP>(48)</SUP></A>     


<P>Additionally, this regulation does not specify that the facility must also advance any
objective of the ombudsman's program while the facility is allowing its residents to
receive information from or contact the ombudsman's office.  As my ruling in section
VI-B indicated, the residents are entitled to contact an ombudsman for any reason
and receive information from an ombudsman concerning any matter under 42 C.F.R.
§ 483.10(g)(2).  These protected exchanges or contacts need not relate to any official
function of a client advocacy agency.  See HCFA Ex. 26 (explanation of the
California Long Term Care Ombudsman Program).  Therefore, Gold Country's
alleged development of an "adversarial relationship" which was not "conducive to
furthering the objectives of the Ombudsman's program," even if true, does not
adequately establish that Gold Country was deficient in its adherence to the
regulation's requirement to allow its residents to "[r]eceive information from
agencies acting as client advocates," and to afford its residents "the opportunity to
contact these agencies."  42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2).


<P>If, for example, there were proof that Gold Country was failing to advance or
cooperate with the goals of the ombudsman program <U>and</U>, additionally, its residents
have experienced limitations in their contacts of or receipt of information from the
ombudsman's office concerning matters that are properly included within an
ombudsman's official duties (<U>see</U> HCFA Ex. 29), it may be reasonable to conclude
that Gold Country was out of compliance with 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2) due to its
adverse attitude towards the ombudsman's program or its lack of cooperation with
the objectives of the program.  However, such is not the situation as established by
HCFA's evidence in this case.  As I discuss also elsewhere in this Decision, no
resident was interviewed during or since the November 17, 1995 survey,<A HREF="#N_49_"><SUP>(49)</SUP></A> and
HCFA has erroneously found a widespread violation of 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2) on
the basis of Gold Country's alleged lack of cooperation in areas where no cooperation
was required by this regulation (<U>see</U> <U>e.g.</U>, sections VII-D and G below).  The evidence
introduced by HCFA does not contain proof which provides credible support for the
conclusion that Gold Country had deviated from its regulatory obligation to allow its
residents to receive information from or contact the Ombudsman's office.

<P>  

<P><STRONG>D.  Even if 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2) could be interpreted to require Gold
Country to engage in a cooperative, open, or non-adversarial relationship with
the ombudsman's office, HCFA has applied these implied requirements
inappropriately to the facts shown by its own evidence.</STRONG>


<P>Even by interpreting broadly the general requirement that the facility must "protect
and promote" its residents' rights (42 C.F.R. § 483.10), I cannot conclude that a
prima facie case of noncompliance with 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2) has been
established by HCFA with the use of Mr. Neihoff's October 31 letter.  Any
cooperation and communication requirement imposed by the regulation (if such a
requirement exists), cannot be construed in derogation of a facility's right to seek
redress for its perceived grievances in a legitimate manner and with the appropriate
individuals.  As I noted earlier, Gold Country's hearing request disputed HCFA's
interpretation of 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2) because, in Gold Country's view, it was
being sanctioned because its representative had expressed the facility's views
forthrightly to Ms. Meyers' superior.



<P>HCFA's evidence suggests nothing improper in Mr. Niehoff's continuing an ongoing
dialogue with Ms. Meyers' superior concerning those matters troubling Mr. Niehoff
and Gold Country.  <U>See</U> HCFA Exs. 2, 8.  The ombudsman's office in this case is a
California governmental agency supported by public funds.  HCFA Ex. 26.  The
program relies upon volunteers.  <U>Id</U>.  Volunteers are trained to be ombudsmen, and
the work of these volunteer ombudsmen are supervised by various program officials. 
<U>Id</U>.  In the state of California, 35 substate programs work under contract for 33 Area
Agencies on Aging.  <U>Id</U>.  There is, of course, oversight provided by the program for
the work being performed by those individuals representing the 33 Area Agencies on
Aging and 35 substate programs.  <U>Id</U>.     

<P>The evidence introduced by HCFA shows that Mr. Litwinovich, as Ms. Meyers'
superior, was the proper person to receive and address the complaints set forth in Mr.
Niehoff's letter.  Mr. Niehoff made those complaints pursuant to RHF's right to do
so.  Unlike Ms. Meyers, who had the option of expressing her complaints against Mr.
Niehoff and Gold Country and thereby trigger a survey of Gold Country, Mr. Niehoff
and his organization had no place to seek redress for their complaints against her
conduct except by taking them to her superior and the head of the area ombudsman
program, Mr. Litwinovich.  


<P>Yet, HCFA's evidence shows also that its surveyors made their finding of
noncompliance under 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2) based in significant part upon their
disagreement with the merits of certain opinions and complaints expressed in Mr.
Niehoff's October 31 letter to Mr. Litwinovich concerning the manner in which Ms.
Meyers was performing her work.<A HREF="#N_50_"><SUP>(50)</SUP></A>  To date, HCFA has not shown how 42 C.F.R. §
483.10(g)(2) may be interpreted as prohibiting a facility from expressing complaints
or criticisms concerning an ombudsman's work to her superior. 

<P>  

<P>I find that, instead of supporting the interpretation of noncompliance reached by
HCFA, Mr. Niehoff's October 31 letter is an example of Gold Country's "open
communication" and "cooperation" with the individual who has oversight of the
relevant ombudsman program in order to discuss certain problems perceived by Gold
Country concerning one ombudsman.  It is a simple fact of logic that "open
communication" and "cooperation" do not denote abstinence from criticisms, nor the
conveyance of only compliments.  Nor do those terms or 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2)
indicate, as suggested by HCFA's evidence and arguments, that "cooperation" and
"open communication" operate only in one direction: from the facility to the
ombudsman's office.<A HREF="#N_51_"><SUP>(51)</SUP></A>  Therefore, even if "open communication" and "cooperation"
could be inferred from 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2), these requirements cannot be
interpreted as HCFA has done here.  


<P><STRONG></STRONG><STRONG>E.  In submitting Mr. Niehoff's October 31, 1995 letter as evidence that Gold
Country was out of compliance because it refused to accede to the ombudsman's
request to mail out certain materials for her, HCFA has improperly interpreted
the requirements of 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2). </STRONG>

<P> 

<P>On the basis of the evidence introduced by HCFA, I conclude also that HCFA erred
in finding Gold Country out of compliance with 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2) because
Mr. Niehoff's October 31 letter indicated that the facility would not mail certain
materials, such as the minutes or agenda of Family Council meetings, at the
ombudsman's request.  


<P>As shown by HCFA's evidence, the finding of noncompliance was based in large part
upon its surveyors' interpretation of Mr. Niehoff's statements in his October 31 letter
concerning Gold Country's reluctant mailing of the Family Council agenda and
minutes which the facility considered "inflammatory and confrontational" and that
the facility has "withdraw[n] its offer to disseminate Ombudsman material. . . ."<A HREF="#N_52_"><SUP>(52)</SUP></A> 
HCFA Ex. 2 at 2.  These statements were considered by the HCFA surveyors in
concluding that "residents and their families" have been denied access to information
from the Ombudsman's office.  HCFA Ex. 9 at 1.  Therefore, the resultant Directed
Plan of Correction imposed by HCFA requires Gold Country to "resume mailing
Ombudsman materials to families along with billing or other facility mailings," as
well as to "ensure that complete and accurate minutes of family and resident council
meetings are taken."  HCFA Ex. 10 at 5.  As I explained previously, I consider the
Directed Plan of Correction to reflect HCFA's legal interpretation of what
compliance with 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2) requires.<A HREF="#N_53_"><SUP>(53)</SUP></A>  

<P>The regulation relied upon by HCFA, 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2), guarantees
communication<A HREF="#N_54_"><SUP>(54)</SUP></A> between the ombudsman and Gold Country's residents.  Under this
regulation, Gold Country's residents are entitled to receive anything sent to them by
the ombudsman or her office, and the residents are entitled to contact the
ombudsman or her office to request any information.  The ombudsman and her office
are at liberty to distribute or mail any document of their choice to Gold Country's
residents.   


<P>Within 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2), there exists no requirement for the facility to mail
or distribute ombudsman materials to its residents.  The evidence from HCFA does
not suggest the existence of any circumstances which have rendered the ombudsman
and her office unable to mail the documents of their choice to any resident of Gold
Country.  Nor does any evidence from HCFA suggest that residents of Gold Country
would be unable to obtain information directly from the ombudsman or her office.<A HREF="#N_55_"><SUP>(55)</SUP></A> 

<P>For obvious reasons, the fact that HCFA's surveyors did not view the Family Council
minutes as inflammatory or confrontational (HCFA Ex. 9 at 2) does not establish a
valid nexus between Gold Country's refusal to mail those Family Council minutes
and HCFA's allegation that the residents' right to "[r]eceive information from
agencies acting as client advocates, and be afforded the opportunity to contact these
agencies" has been violated.  42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2).  Therefore, HCFA's evidence
indicates that it has unlawfully and inappropriately inserted into 42 C.F.R. §
483.10(g)(2) a requirement that the facility distribute or mail at the facility's expense
the materials designated by the ombudsman.

<P>  

<P>Given that 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2) pertains to the residents' right to communicate
with and have access to client advocacy agencies, it is significant also that HCFA has
introduced no evidence showing that any <U>resident</U> was receiving Gold Country's
billing statements, which were supposed to contain also the ombudsman's materials
such as the Family Council minutes and agenda.  <U>See</U> HCFA Ex. 10 at 5.  In fact,
HCFA's evidence showing that Gold Country was using the mail to send out billing
statements (with enclosures) implied that those individuals residing at the facility
were not the recipients of such mailed materials.  Therefore, HCFA's evidence does
not even show that Gold Country's unwillingness or refusal to mail out materials
designated by the ombudsman has any bearing on the residents' exercise of their
rights under 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2).     


<P><STRONG>F.  HCFA's evidence shows that it has misinterpreted 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2)
by referring to the residents' family members and the transmittal of
information concerning the Family Council, when this regulation does not
pertain to the rights of a Family Council and HCFA has made no showing that
any family member in this case has acquired the legal standing to exercise a
resident's rights under 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2).   </STRONG>



<P>I re-emphasize that 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2) states on its face that it is a facility's
<U>residents</U> who have the right to receive information from the ombudsman.<A HREF="#N_56_"><SUP>(56)</SUP></A>  Yet,
HCFA has consistently included references to the residents' families as if they have
the same rights as residents under 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2).  


<P>For example, because Gold Country was withdrawing its offer to disseminate
"Ombudsman material" and would not provide confidential mailing addresses to the
ombudsman's

<P>office (HCFA Ex. 2 at 2), HCFA's noncompliance determination contains the
rationale that "<U>residents and their families</U>" have been denied access to information
from the Ombudsman's office.  HCFA Ex. 9 at 1 (emphasis added).  Additionally,
because Gold Country characterized the September 1995 Family Council meeting
minutes as "inflammatory and confrontational" (HCFA Ex. 2 at 2), HCFA is
requiring Gold Country to "ensure that complete and accurate minutes of <U>family and
resident council</U> meetings are taken"<A HREF="#N_57_"><SUP>(57)</SUP></A> in order to come into compliance with 42
C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2).  HCFA Ex. 10 at 5 (emphasis added).  


<P>Families do not have the same rights as residents under 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2). 
The regulation provides specifically in relevant parts: 


<P>	(3) <U>In the case of a resident adjudged incompetent</U> under the laws of a
State by a court of competent jurisdiction, the rights of the resident
are exercised by the person appointed under State law to act on the
resident's behalf.


<P>	(4)  In the case of a resident who has not been adjudged incompetent
by the State court, any <U>legal-surrogate designated in accordance with
State law</U> may exercise the resident's rights to the extent provided by
State law.



<P>42 C.F.R. § 483.10(a)(3), (4) (emphasis added).  Similarly, a different regulation
provides the residents with the right to form "resident groups" in the facility, while
their families also have the right to meet with other families in the facility.  42 C.F.R.
§ 483.15(c).  As I note elsewhere in this Decision, HCFA has not alleged or found
noncompliance pertaining to the residents' or their families' right to form groups, to
meet, or to obtain the assistance of Gold Country's staff under 42 C.F.R. § 483.15(c). 



<P>The evidence presented by HCFA in this case does not establish that any of the
resident's family members has acquired the right under State law to act on behalf of
any resident living at Gold Country.  Contrary to what is implied by the Directed
Plan of Correction, 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2) does not require Gold Country to ensure
the taking of accurate minutes at meetings where an ombudsman is in attendance. 
Additionally, as I noted above, there is no evidence that billing statements containing
"ombudsman materials" or Family Council minutes were being mailed by Gold
Country to residents of the facility.  There is no evidence that any piece of
information sent by the Ombudsman's office or the ombudsman to a resident had
failed to reach that resident, or vice versa.  There is also no evidence that Gold
Country prevented the ombudsman or her office from mailing the materials of their
choice to any resident of their choice.  What HCFA did in this case was make a
determination of noncompliance under 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2) based upon legally
and factually unsupported intimations that the families of residents have the same
rights as the residents of Gold Country and that, somehow, those rights extended to
the families' receipt of the ombudsman's materials, such as the Family Council
minutes sent in mailings paid for by Gold Country.     

<P>      

<P><STRONG>G.  The information contained in Ms. Meyers' declaration is legally deficient
and, even if considered in combination with other evidence also presented by
HCFA, fails to provide valid support for HCFA's conclusions that Gold
Country had deficiencies under 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2), or that the health or
safety of Gold Country's residents were placed at more than minimal risk as a
result. </STRONG>


<P>	1.  <U>The generalized nature of Ms. Meyers' statements</U>


<P>Even though HCFA had not listed Ms. Meyers as a potential witness when it thought
it might have the opportunity to present in-person testimony, HCFA has filed with its
brief a declaration executed by Ms. Meyers in August of 1997.  


<P>Ms. Meyers' declaration contains a paragraph which sets forth her interpretation of
Mr. Niehoff's letter to her superior.<A HREF="#N_58_"><SUP>(58)</SUP></A>  In addition, her declaration contains only one
paragraph referring to the events which allegedly took place during the relevant time
period.  In referring to those events, Ms. Meyers has provided only generalizations:


<P>	[d]uring the summer of 1995 and continuing through at least
November of that year, Gold Country resisted working cooperatively
with the Ombudsman program.  This resistance was manifested in
several ways, most notably in attempts to restrict communications and
minimize my presence in the facility.  Staff of the facility had
difficulty speaking to me directly and referred all my questions to the
administration.  Attempts were made by the Gold Country
administration to undermine my authority and credibility with
residents and their families through unfounded attacks on my
competence and motivation.  The facility administration took actions
to disrupt and disband the regular Family Council meetings -- during
which resident family members come together to exchange
information and discuss matters of mutual interest and concern. 
These actions by Gold Country made it difficult for me to interact and
communicate with residents of the facility and their family members.


<P>HCFA Ex. 29 at 1-2, para. 3.  


<P>Ms. Meyers' assertions lack factual foundation.  She has not adequately identified
any event which can be objectively viewed as providing credible support for the
conclusion that Gold Country had curtailed any right of communication under 42
C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2).  What Ms. Meyers has given are her summary impressions or
opinions concerning events she does not describe in detail.  As noted by Gold
Country, general conclusions, allegations, and opinions do not prove the existence of
any underlying facts.  <U>See</U> P. Reply, at 5.  


<P>The absence of details is significant also because, as I discussed above, HCFA
cannot reach a noncompliance determination based solely on the existence of isolated
deficiencies which have caused no actual harm to any resident.  Thus, generalized
statements made by Ms. Meyers, who did not describe the degree, frequency, or
specifics of any alleged action by Gold Country, do not help satisfy HCFA's
obligation to prove that its noncompliance determination was made on the basis of
identified deficiencies which were not isolated, and which posed more than minimal
risk to the residents' health or safety.  <U>See</U> 42 C.F.R. §§ 488.301, 488.26(c)(2).<A HREF="#N_59_"><SUP>(59)</SUP></A> 
Moreover, HCFA is seeking to support its surveyors' conclusion that Gold Country's
deficiencies under 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2) constituted not only noncompliance, but
were properly assigned the "F" level on the scope and severity matrix "(i.e., no actual
harm with potential for more than minimal widespread harm that is not immediate
jeopardy)."  HCFA Ex. 30 at 5.  Therefore, absent the necessary factual foundation,
Ms. Meyers' declaration does not establish the reasonableness of the conclusions she
has expressed therein.  For the same reason, her declaration fails to provide legally
sufficient support for the noncompliance determination made by HCFA.


<P>	2.  <U>HCFA's misinterpretation of the regulatory requirements as also
reflected in Ms. Meyers' declaration</U>    


<P>			i.  <U>Ms. Meyers' contention that Gold Country
attempted to restrict her communications with
unspecified persons</U>


<P>Some of Ms. Meyers' statements do not appear to correspond to any element of 42
C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2). 

<P>For example, Ms. Meyers referred to "attempts to restrict communications" without
specifying with whom or what type of people she was endeavoring to communicate
with at the times Gold Country made its "attempts to restrict communications."  In
fact, she went on to state that Gold Country's staff "had difficulty speaking to [her]
directly" -- thereby suggesting a restriction of communication between her and Gold
Country's staff.  


<P>If this was her meaning, then this allegation, even if assumed true, does not establish
even a deficiency under 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2).  The regulation relied upon by
HCFA does not require the facility's staff to communicate directly with the
ombudsman; nor does the regulation impose any duty on the facility to ensure
unrestricted or direct communication between its staff and the ombudsman.  The
regulation guarantees only that the ombudsman and the residents are able to
communicate between themselves when they wish to do so.


<P>			ii.  <U>Ms. Meyers' contention that  Gold Country had
attempted to disrupt and disband Family Council
meetings and thereby made difficult her ability to
communicate with residents and their family
members</U>


<P>I have similar problems with Ms. Meyers' assertion that Gold Country had attempted
to disrupt and disband the Family Council meetings and thereby made it difficult for
her "to interact and communicate with residents of the facility and their family
members."  HCFA Ex. 29 at 2.  


<P>Even if I were to overlook the unsupported generality of the foregoing assertion and
conclusion by Ms. Meyers, the evidence submitted by HCFA is still not sufficient for
establishing that Gold Country was out of compliance with the requirements of 42
C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2).  Neither Ms. Meyers' declaration nor other evidence
submitted by HCFA establishes that 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2) protects the Family
Council meetings which Gold Country had allegedly attempted to disrupt or disband. 
Neither Ms. Meyers' declaration nor other evidence introduced by HCFA establishes
that any of Gold Country's residents was using Family Council meetings to
"[r]eceive information from agencies acting as client advocates" or to "contact these
agencies."  42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2).

<P>    

<P>The evidence introduced by HCFA does not establish that Gold Country's residents
attended these Family Council meetings.  For example, Mr. Niehoff's October 31
letter asserted only that Ms. Meyers "tends to `stir up the pot' with the Family
Council," as when "only three or four <U>family</U> representatives show up for these
meetings. . . ."  HCFA Ex. 2 at 1 (emphasis added).  Similarly, Mr. Litwinovich's
November 15, 1995 response letter indicated only that Ms. Meyers was "encouraging
involvement and dialogue among <U>family</U> members and active participation in Family
Council meetings . . . ."  HCFA Ex. 8 at 1 (emphasis added).<A HREF="#N_60_"><SUP>(60)</SUP></A>  The family members'
attendance at Family Council meetings cannot be construed as the residents'
attendance because, as I noted earlier, there is no evidence that any family member in
this case has been delegated the legal authority pursuant to 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(a)(3)
and (4) to exercise the residents' rights under 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2).   


<P>Additionally, if HCFA had found true Ms. Meyers' allegation that Gold Country has
disrupted and attempted to disband the Family Council meetings, HCFA should have
determined Gold Country to be at least deficient under the requirements of 42 C.F.R.
§ 483.15(c).  This regulation entitles the families of residents to meet in the facility
and requires the facility to provide the family group with private space for its
meetings.  42 C.F.R. § 483.15(c)(2), (3).  In fact, HCFA has made no finding of
deficiency against Gold Country under any of the following provisions of 42 C.F.R.
§ 483.15(c):


<P>	-- A facility must care for its residents in a manner and in an
environment that promotes maintenance or enhancement of each
resident's quality of life.


<P>	. . . 


<P>			(c) <U>Participation in resident and family groups</U>. 


<P>				(1) A resident has the right to organize and
participate in resident groups in the facility;


<P>				(2) A resident's family has the right to meet in
the facility with the families of other residents
in the facility;


<P>				(3) The facility must provide a resident or
family group, if one exists, with private space;


<P>				(4) Staff or visitors may attend meetings at the
group's invitation;


<P>				(5) The facility must provide a designated
staff person responsible for providing
assistance and responding to written requests
that result from group meetings;


<P>				(6) When a resident or family group exists,
the facility must listen to the views and act
upon the grievances and recommendations of
residents and families concerning proposed
policy and operational decisions affecting
resident care and life in the facility.


<P>42 C.F.R. § 483.15(c).  


<P>HCFA has not made any finding against Gold Country under 42 C.F.R. § 483.15(c). 
<U>See</U> HCFA Ex. 9.  Instead, HCFA's arguments and evidence, such as Ms. Meyers'
declaration, create the unfounded impression that the Family Council has something
to do with the residents' rights under 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2), and therefore
unspecified efforts by Gold Country to interfere with Family Council meetings
constitute proof that Gold Country has failed to comply with 42 C.F.R. §
483.10(g)(2)'s requirements concerning the rights of residents to contact and receive
information from the ombudsman or her office.  


<P>			iii. <U>Ms. Meyers' contention that Gold Country had
made attempts to undermine her authority and
credibility with the residents and their families
through unfounded attacks on her competence and
motivation, and thereby made difficult her ability to
communicate with residents and their family
members</U>


<P>Ms. Meyers appears to base her conclusion that "[t]hese actions by Gold Country
made it difficult for me to interact and communicate with residents of the facility and
their family members" also in part on her assertion that "[a]ttempts were made by the
Gold Country administration to undermine my authority and credibility with
residents and their families through unfounded attacks on my competence and
motivation."  HCFA Ex. 29 at 2.  Her declaration does not identify these alleged
attempts by Gold Country.  Therefore, for the reasons already discussed above, I
cannot accept her generalized, unsupported assertion as true.  Such an assertion does
not help establish the validity of her conclusion that Gold Country had made it
difficult for her to communicate with residents and their family members.<A HREF="#N_61_"><SUP>(61)</SUP></A>    


<P>The only relevant evidence provided by HCFA concerning any alleged attempt by
Gold Country to undermine her authority and credibility through "unfounded
attacks" on her competency and motivation appears to be the contents of Mr.
Niehoff's October 31 letter to Ms. Meyers' superior.  However, this letter was not
addressed to any resident or family member; nor is there any indication that Gold
Country had shared the contents of said letter criticizing Ms. Meyers' professionalism
with any resident or family member.  Instead, HCFA's evidence shows only that Ms.
Meyers provided a copy of Mr. Niehoff's letter to HCFA's surveyors, who then
summarized its contents (including the criticisms of Ms. Meyers' professionalism and
motivation) in their survey report/statement of deficiencies.  As a consequence of the
actions Ms. Meyers and HCFA's surveyors took during the survey of November 17,
1995, Gold Country's residents were entitled to read of Gold Country's criticisms of
Ms. Meyers' conduct and professionalism if they exercised their right to review
survey results under 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g).  


<P>For these reasons, Ms. Meyers' declaration, even when considered in combination
with the other evidence introduced by HCFA, is not sufficient for showing that Gold
Country had made Ms. Meyers' ability to interact and communicate with residents
difficult through the alleged use of unfounded attacks on her competency and
motivation during the time preceding HCFA's November 17, 1995 survey.  



<P><STRONG></STRONG><STRONG>H.  HCFA's evidence on Gold Country's failure to report its residents'
allegations to the ombudsman, even when considered together with other
evidence also introduced by HCFA, is not adequate for establishing that Gold
Country had a deficiency under 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2).</STRONG>


<P>The declaration of HCFA surveyor Kenneth Simpson, which was submitted by
HCFA in support of its determination at issue, contains the following relevant
information:


<P>	[d]uring her interview, Ms. Meyers provided the survey team with a
list of six incidents involving Gold Country residents that the facility
had reported to the Ombudsman's office for her involvement during
the period from June 29, 1995 through September 13, 1995.  [See
HCFA Ex. 23.]  A review by the survey team of the facility's
grievance, abuse and change of condition logs found that a number of
complaints had been entered in these logs during the period October
1, 1995 to November 8, 1995.  When we brought these log entries to
Ms. Meyers attention, she observed that none of these allegations had
been reported to her office.  Gold Country's failure to notify the
Ombudsman's office of these incidents indicated to me that Gold
Country was interfering with the ability of its residents to receive
critical information and assistance from the Ombudsman's office and
to contact the Ombudsman.


<P>HCFA Ex. 30 at 3-4.    


<P>HCFA's use of the resident complaint logs was further explained as follows by Mr.
Simpson:


<P>	[i]n particular, we [the surveyors] were concerned that Gold Country's
expressions of hostility toward the Ombudsman and noncooperation
with the Ombudsman's office (as evidenced by the failure to report
resident allegations of abuse, changes in resident condition and
resident grievances) limited (or certainly had the potential to limit) the
residents' access to the Ombudsman and, therefore, their ability to
contact and receive information from this official advocacy agency. 
Accordingly, the survey team cited a violation of 42 C.F.R. §
483.10(g)(2) on the Statement of Deficiencies we prepared following
completion of the survey and assessed this deficiency in the "F"
category on the scope and severity matrix (i.e., no actual harm with
potential for more than minimal widespread harm that is not
immediate jeopardy).


<P>HCFA Ex. 30 at 5. 


<P>The foregoing rationale submitted by HCFA is another example of HCFA's having
improperly reached the issue of whether residents have been placed at risk, when
there is not sufficient evidence establishing that any mandate or prohibition of 42
C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2) has been violated by Gold Country.  As I discussed previously,
unless the evidence first establishes the existence of a deficiency under the specified
regulation, it is not appropriate to consider whether or to what extent a facility's
residents have been placed at risk.  The absence or presence of a deficiency must be
determined with reference to what is specified by the regulation cited by HCFA, as
applied to the facts introduced by HCFA.  


<P>The regulation codified at 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2) does not require a facility to
report its residents' allegations to the ombudsman.  Nor does this regulation state that
an ombudsman has a right to become involved in all complaints filed by residents
with the facility itself.  This regulation relates only to the <U>residents</U>' right to contact
and receive information from the ombudsman's office.  It would follow that the
residents should have a right of choice under 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2) even when
they have complaints to voice concerning the facility.  Additionally, the regulations
do not compel residents to contact or receive assistance from any ombudsman if they
do not wish to do so.<A HREF="#N_62_"><SUP>(62)</SUP></A>
<P>  However, if they wish to contact or receive information from
an ombudsman concerning any complaint they have, they have the right to do so
under 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2).  Nothing in 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2) suggests the
existence of a legal presumption that each resident who files a complaint with the
facility would want to also contact, receive information from, or obtain the assistance
of an ombudsman with respect to that complaint.   


<P>In order to support its conclusion that Gold Country had wrongfully withheld its
residents' complaints from the ombudsman's office, HCFA has identified in its brief
various state and federal statutes concerning the type of work an ombudsman's office
is authorized to perform.  HCFA Br., 5-6.  Without doubt, those state and federal
statutes provide ombudsmen with the authority to receive, investigate, and resolve
residents' complaints.  But none of the legal citations provided by HCFA indicates
that a facility must turn over all of the complaints it has received from residents to an
ombudsman for investigation and resolution.  None of the legal citations provided by
HCFA indicates that the facility is under an obligation to provide the ombudsman
with a copy of, or information concerning, all complaints it has received from its
residents.  None of the legal authorities relied upon by HCFA shows that all residents
must request or receive the assistance of an ombudsman to resolve all complaints
they may have concerning the care and services they are receiving from a facility.    


<P>Additionally, HCFA has not alleged that Gold Country has deviated from its
obligation to:  


<P>	--  provide its residents with a written description of their legal rights
and services by posting the "names, addresses, and telephone numbers
of all pertinent State client advocacy groups such as the State survey
and certification agency, the State licensure office, the State
ombudsman program, the protection and advocacy network, and the
Medicaid fraud control unit . . . ." (42 C.F.R. § 483.10(b)(7)(iii));<A HREF="#N_63_"><SUP>(63)</SUP></A>


<P>	-- notify its residents of their legal rights and services by providing
them with a "statement that the resident may file a complaint with the
State survey and certification agency concerning resident abuse,
neglect, misappropriation of resident property in the facility, and
noncompliance with the advance directives requirements" (42 C.F.R.
§ 483.10(b)(7)(iv));


<P>	--  allow its residents to "[v]oice grievances without discrimination or
reprisal."  42 C.F.R. § 483.10(f)(1);


<P>	--  undertake "[p]rompt efforts . . . to resolve grievances the residents
may have 

<P>	. . . ." (42 C.F.R. § 483.10(f)(2));


<P>	--  allow its residents their right to privacy in their written
communications (42 C.F.R. § 483.10(i));


<P>	--  provide its residents with reasonable access to "the use of a
telephone where calls can be made without being overheard" (42
C.F.R. § 483.10(k));


<P>	--  allow "immediate access" to its residents by any State long term
care ombudsman (42 C.F.R. § 483.10(j)(iv)).


<P>In the foregoing context, HCFA's proof that resident complaints appeared in logs
kept by Gold Country from October 1 to November 8, 1995 (but these complaints
were not known to the ombudsman until HCFA surveyors disclosed them to her
during the November 17, 1995 survey) establishes only that Gold Country has
received those complaints from its residents.  The residents were entitled to submit
their complaints to Gold Country under 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(f)(1).  No evidence from
HCFA shows that any of those residents had asked Gold Country to provide copies
of their complaints to the ombudsman, or to report the existence of their complaints
to the ombudsman.  The fact that Ms. Meyers was unaware of those complaints noted
in Gold Country's logs for October 1 - November 8, 1995, indicates also that those
residents have never asked Ms. Meyers or her office to become involved in their
complaints. 


<P>The absence of such evidence renders invalid HCFA's reasoning that "Gold
Country's failure to notify the Ombudsman's office of these incidents indicated . . .
that Gold Country was interfering with the ability of its residents to receive critical
information and assistance from the Ombudsman's office and to contact the
Ombudsman."  HCFA Ex. 30 at 4.  The absence of such evidence also renders
invalid HCFA's conclusion that Gold Country's alleged "expressions of hostility . . .
and noncooperation with the Ombudsman's office" constituted noncompliance with
42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2), because Gold Country's "failure to report resident
allegations . . . limited (or certainly had the potential to limit) the residents' access to
the Ombudsman and, therefore, their ability to contact and receive information from
this official advocacy agency."  HCFA Ex. 30 at 5.  The evidence submitted by
HCFA is not sufficient for establishing that Gold Country had a legal obligation to
convey the residents' complaints to the ombudsman.  Therefore, Gold Country's
withholding of such information from the ombudsman's office under the facts of this
case as presented by HCFA cannot be viewed as wrongful or as material proof that
Gold Country had deviated from the requirements of 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2) to
allow its residents to have access to, and to receive information from, the
ombudsman's office. 




<P><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSION</CENTER>
</STRONG>


<P>For all of the foregoing reasons, I set aside HCFA's finding that Gold Country was
out of compliance with 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2).  All proceedings before me have
been concluded.  There remains no outstanding motions or issues for disposition by
me.    

<P>Mimi Hwang Leahy      
<br>Administrative Law Judge
<hr>

<P><font size="-1"><A NAME="N_1_">1. </A>       Throughout this Decision, I will use the terms
"compliance" to mean "substantial compliance" and
"noncompliance" to mean the "failure to be in substantial
compliance," as indicated by 42 C.F.R. § 488.301. 

<P> 
<P><A NAME="N_2_">2. </A>       Previous to my issuing the ruling and scheduling
order on June 20, 1997, both parties had submitted their
proposed exhibits.  Those previously submitted exhibits
related to the outstanding issues under 42 C.F.R. §
483.10(g)(2), as well as to other disputes which I
resolved on June 20, 1997.  


<P>In my June 20, 1997 ruling and scheduling order, I
provided the parties with another opportunity to submit
additional supporting evidence with their briefs on the
issue of Petitioner's alleged noncompliance with 42
C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2).  Both parties have made use of
this additional opportunity, as I discuss herein. 
Neither party has moved to withdraw any previously
submitted evidence, even though not all of their
previously submitted evidence relates to the pending
issues under 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2).


<P>Thus, all of the documentary evidence submitted by the
parties to date (HCFA Exs. 1 - 30 and P. Exs. 1 - 14)
have been received into evidence.  Those documents which
related solely to HCFA's determinations under other
regulations were considered by me when I denied the
motions filed by HCFA and delineated the present
parameters of this case.  (See discussion in next section
of this Decision.)  To the extent HCFA has an objection
to my receipt of certain new evidence filed by Gold
Country under my June 20, 1997 ruling and scheduling
order, I have overruled HCFA's objections as discussed
below.

<P><A NAME="N_3_">3. </A>       The numbered items in this section constitute
summaries of my findings of fact and conclusions of law
(FFCLs), which are detailed and explained in the
designated portions of this Decision or other cited
documents.
<P><A NAME="N_4_">4. </A>        For purposes of 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g), the
relevant client advocacy agencies are: "the State survey
and certification agency, the State licensure office
(usually synonymous with the survey and certification
agency), the ombudsman program established by the State
under the Older Americans Act of 1965; the protection and
advocacy system for developmentally disabled individuals
established under the Developmental Disabilities
Assistance and Bill of Rights Act; the protection and
advocacy system established under the Protection and
Advocacy for Mentally Ill Individuals Act; and the
Medicaid fraud control unit established under section
1903(q) of the Act, as amended by the Medicare-Medicaid
Anti-Fraud and Abuse Amendments of 1977."  56 Fed. Reg.
48,832 (1991).


<P>There is no dispute that the ombudsman program involved
in this case, the Long Term Care Ombudsman Program for El
Dorado County, California, is a client advocacy agency
within the meaning of 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2).  <U>See</U> HCFA
Exs. 26, 29.


<P><A NAME="N_5_">5. </A>       I will refer to these two rulings as "Feb. 11,
1997 Ruling" and "June 20, 1997 Ruling," respectively.
<P><A NAME="N_6_">6. </A>       In my February 11, 1997 Ruling, I had found as an
undisputed fact that the California Department of Health
Services, acting as HCFA's agent, had conducted the
survey on November 17, 1995 and drafted the survey
report/statement of deficiencies adopted by HCFA in its
notice letter to Gold Country.  Feb. 11, 1997 Ruling, at
2 - 3.  However, evidence recently submitted by HCFA
shows that HCFA's own surveyors had conducted the
November 17 survey.  <U>See</U> HCFA Ex. 30. 
<P><A NAME="N_7_">7. </A>       A SS Level of D denotes isolated deficiencies
which caused no actual harm, but which have the potential
for causing more than minimal harm to residents; a SS
Level of E denotes a pattern of deficiencies which caused
no actual harm, but which have the potential for causing
more than minimal harm to residents; a SS Level of "F"
denotes widespread deficiencies which caused no actual
harm, but which have the potential for causing more than
minimal harm to residents.  HCFA Ex. 27.


<P>Under the regulations, "substantial compliance" means "a
level of compliance with the requirements of
participation such that any identified deficiencies pose
no greater risk to resident health or safety than the
potential for causing minimal harm."  42 C.F.R. §
488.301.  "Noncompliance" means "any deficiency that
causes a facility to not be in substantial compliance." 
<U>Id</U>. 
<P><A NAME="N_8_">8. </A>       These portions of HCFA's brief eliminated any
doubt which might have existed as to whether the specific
SS levels indicated in the survey report/statement of
deficiencies (HCFA Form 2567) had been adopted by HCFA
when its notice letter dated December 8, 1995
incorporated by reference said document.  
<P><A NAME="N_9_">9. </A>       HCFA argued also: 


<P>	Petitioner's admission of the validity of
deficiency F 272, with a scope and severity
level of "E" on the Grid, establishes that it
was not in substantial compliance with 42

<P>C.F.R. Part 483.  


<P>Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dism. or, Alternatively, for
Summ. Disp., at 6.


<P>For reasons that are obvious from the record, my rulings
contain no finding that Gold Country had made any
"admission of noncompliance."  Gold Country informed
HCFA's counsel only, "Gold Country will not be contesting
the validity of the issuance of deficiencies F272 at the
upcoming hearing."  HCFA Ex. 28.  During a subsequent
prehearing conference to establish a briefing schedule
for HCFA's motion to dismiss, Gold Country's counsel
requested time to evaluate the matter further.  Summary
of Prehearing Conference and Order Scheduling Case for
Briefing (Sept. 17, 1996).   

<P> 
<P><A NAME="N_10_">10. </A>       HCFA correctly interpreted these cases to mean
"that an entity cannot challenge a finding of
noncompliance (or deficiencies) where no enforcement
action is imposed."  Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dism. or,
Alternatively, for Summ. Disp., at 7.  However, HCFA
misapplied this legal principle in its attempt to
preclude my review of Gold Country's challenges to F Tag
168.  Unlike <U>Country Club Center II</U> and that line of
cases, HCFA did make a finding of noncompliance under F
Tag 168 in this case, and that finding of noncompliance
under F Tag 168 resulted in HCFA's imposing the "Directed
Plan of Correction, Tag F-168" (HCFA Ex. 10) as a remedy
against Gold Country.  Additionally, HCFA did not rescind
the "Directed Plan of Correction, Tag F-168" in this
case.  There is no dispute that this remedy took effect
in 1995, as specified in HCFA's notice letter (HCFA Ex.
10 at 2). 

<P>  
<P><A NAME="N_11_">11. </A>       For example, the declaration of HCFA's Associate
Regional Administrator states: 


<P>	As a result of these three deficiencies, my
office determined that the facility was not in
substantial compliance with controlling
Medicare participation requirements . . .
Accordingly, my office made a finding of
noncompliance . . . premised on these three
deficiencies.  Declaration of Janice M.
Caldwell at 2, attached to Mem. in Supp. of
HCFA's Renewed Mot. to Dism.


<P>	. . . 


<P>	It was for these reasons that HCFA considered
it appropriate to impose this one remedy for
these three deficiencies (which were, in sum,
the basis for the certification of
noncompliance).  <U>Id</U>. at 4.
<P><A NAME="N_12_">12. </A>        An affected entity's hearing rights are set

Medicare or Medicaid program, respectively, if HCFA has
made "a finding of noncompliance that results in the

<P><A NAME="N_13_">13. </A>       In my ruling denying HCFA's renewed motion to
dismiss, I discussed my reasons for having rejected
HCFA's contention that the "results in the imposition of
a remedy" requirement of 42 C.F.R. § 498.3(b)(12) has
been satisfied for F Tag 272 by its official's intent or
hope to bring about Gold Country's voluntary compliance
with the unrelated program requirements of F Tags 272 and
329 by using a Directed Plan which was narrowly drafted
to mandate only the correction of F Tag 168.  June 20,
1997 Ruling at 5 - 7. 

<P><A NAME="N_14_">14. </A>       By letter dated December 8, 1995, HCFA notified
Petitioner that the enclosed "Directed Plan of
Correction, Tag F-168" was being imposed "effective 15
days from receipt of this letter," and, additionally,

<P>the "Denial of Payment for All New Admissions" remedy
would take effect on January 31, 1996 unless Petitioner
achieved compliance before then.  HCFA Ex. 10 at 2.   


<P>Subsequently, by letter dated January 26, 1996, HCFA
notified Petitioner that the Denial of Payment for New
Admissions remedy would not be imposed because HCFA had

<P>decided to accept Petitioner's allegations of compliance
with respect to those deficiencies found during the
November 17, 1995 survey.  HCFA Ex. 13.  The "Directed
Plan of Correction, Tag F-168" remedy was not rescinded;
it had been implemented by Petitioner in accordance with
the deadline mandated by HCFA's December 8 notice letter. 
<U>Id</U>.
<P><A NAME="N_15_">15. </A>        The process does not preclude the parties from
presenting motions before hearing to resolve
disagreements over statutory or regulatory
interpretations.   
<P><A NAME="N_16_">16. </A>       I have allowed HCFA's new theories and evidence
to remain of record for reasons unique to this case. 
Specifically, when I determined that this case may
proceed to adjudication without an in-person hearing, the
scheduling order I issued did not restrict the parties to
relying upon their previously submitted proposed
exhibits. (Previously, the parties had submitted their
proposed exhibits for an anticipated in-person hearing
and before I had delineated the current issues in
response to HCFA's summary judgment motions.)  Under my
scheduling order, Gold Country also had the opportunity
to address any new matter raised by HCFA with its brief.  

<P>I am not holding that, in all cases, HCFA has a right to
introduce new rationale or assertions of fact during
litigation as support for its initial determination.  In
appropriate cases, I may preclude HCFA from introducing
matters which cannot be reasonably inferred from the
information contained in or referenced by HCFA's formal
notice of its initial determination. 
<P><A NAME="N_17_">17. </A>       The regulation defines a "plan of correction" as
"a plan developed by the facility and approved by HCFA or
the survey agency that describes the actions the facility
will take to correct deficiencies and specifies the date
by which those deficiencies will be corrected."  42
C.F.R. § 488.401.
<P><A NAME="N_18_">18. </A>       According to the survey report for October 31,
1995 (HCFA Ex. 1), the surveyors reviewed the records of
six recently deceased residents and then found that the
records of one deceased resident (Resident # 1)
established Gold Country's noncompliance with 42 C.F.R. §
483.10(b)(11) and that its noncompliance was at the
"immediate jeopardy" level.  

<P>  
<P><A NAME="N_19_">19. </A>       Even though the survey report/statement of
deficiencies indicated generally that the survey was
based on "interview" (HCFA Ex. 9 at 1), HCFA Surveyor
Kenneth Simpson stated in his affidavit for these
proceedings that the individual interviewed was Kathryne
Meyers, a representative of the area Ombudsman's office. 
HCFA Ex. 30 at 3.  
<P><A NAME="N_20_">20. </A>       The HCFA surveyors have repeatedly noted the
fact that the letter was written on the last day of Gold
Country's prior survey.  HCFA Ex. 9 at 1; HCFA Ex. 30 at
3.  However, HCFA has not explained why the date might be
significant to the issue of Gold Country's alleged
noncompliance with 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2).
<P><A NAME="N_21_">21. </A>       For convenience, I will refer to the letter as
either the October 31 letter or Mr. Niehoff's letter.  In
using these abbreviations, I do not suggest that he was
writing in his personal capacity.  There is no dispute
that he is an official for RHF and wrote the October 31
letter in his official capacity on RHF stationary.


<P>I have taken note of Mr. Niehoff's position with RHF only
because the proper party in this case is Gold Country,
which has its own Medicare provider number and its own
Administrator.  Gold Country, not RHF, was found out of
compliance and subjected to an enforcement remedy. 
However, neither party has raised any issue concerning
RHF's legal relationship to these proceedings. 
Therefore, in the absence of any contrary assertions by
Gold Country, I am assuming that Mr. Niehoff, as an
official of RHF, had the authority to assert positions
and take actions on behalf of Gold Country as well. 
<P><A NAME="N_22_">22. </A>       A State of California publication introduced
into evidence by HCFA explains that the Ombudsman program
is "a public/government/community-supported program," and
"[v]olunteers are an integral part of this program." 
HCFA Ex. 26.  The publication states also that the Office
of the State Long Term Care Ombudsman "administers the
program through thirty-five substate programs contracted
through the thirty-three Area Agencies on Aging."  <U>Id</U>.
<P><A NAME="N_23_">23. </A>       My purpose here is to set forth the manner in
which the November 17 survey was conducted and the scope
of the surveyors' inquiries.  I am not deciding the
veracity of the information contained in the two letters
submitted by the two area nursing home administrators,
even though Gold Country has urged me to do so.  <U>See</U> P.
Reply, 11-12.  
<P><A NAME="N_24_">24. </A>       These documents are called by different names in
the record.  The survey report/statement of deficiencies
referred to them as the facility's "incident/accident"
logs.  HCFA Ex. 9 at 1.  HCFA's surveyor called it the
facility's "grievance, abuse and change of condition
logs" in his declaration.  HCFA Ex. 30 at 4.  Gold
Country placed into evidence a document called "Resident
Allegation Log."  P. Ex. 4.  HCFA has not contended that
these are not the same documents reviewed by its

<P>surveyors on November 17, 1995.
<P><A NAME="N_25_">25. </A>       The survey report is referenced in the notice
letter as "Form HCFA - 2567."
<P><A NAME="N_26_">26. </A>        I am aware that HCFA's choice of remedies is
not appealable and that I cannot alter or set aside the
"Directed Plan of Correction, Tag F - 168" as drafted by
HCFA if Petitioner was in fact out of compliance with 42
C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2).  <U>See</U> 42 C.F.R. § 498.3(d)(11).  I
have not reviewed the contents of said plan for those
purposes.


<P>I have reviewed the contents of the "Directed Plan of
Correction, Tag F - 168" because it was drafted by HCFA,
because the body of HCFA's December 8, 1995 notice letter
sets forth no explanations about the noncompliance at
issue, and because the Directed Plan gives meaning to the
summary factual conclusions contained in the survey
report (Form HCFA 2567).  Reviewing the contents of the
"Directed Plan of Correction, Tag F-168" is appropriate
for understanding HCFA's view of the legal requirements
contained in 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2) and how HCFA has
related its surveyors' factual findings to those legal
requirements.  As explained by the Secretary in proposing
the regulation now codified as 42 C.F.R. § 488.424 (the
regulation relied upon by HCFA in its notice letter to
impose the Directed Plan against Gold Coast (HCFA Ex. 10
at 2)): "[t]he principle behind a PoC is to ensure that
the underlying cause of cited deficiencies does not
recur."  59 Fed. Reg. 56,195 (1994).  Moreover, a
Directed Plan of Correction, like any other remedy, is
supposed to be imposed to "ensure prompt compliance with
program requirements."  42 C.F.R. § 488.402. 

<P> 
<P><A NAME="N_27_">27. </A>        The Directed Plan is the only place which
suggests that Gold Country had any deficient practice
with respect to a <U>residents</U>' council, <U>residents</U>' council
meetings, or <U>residents</U>' council minutes.  As discussed
elsewhere in this Decision, HCFA's evidence does not even
establish that any <U>resident</U> council was in existence at
Gold Country.  
<P><A NAME="N_28_">28. </A>       Below, I address these disputes in the context
of analyzing how HCFA has interpreted 42 C.F.R. §
483.10(g)(2) in making the noncompliance determination at
issue.  I do not reach the question of whether I have the
authority to modify the contents of a directed plan of
correction if, unlike this case, HCFA had made a valid
noncompliance determination based on a correct
interpretation of the regulation. 
<P><A NAME="N_29_">29. </A>        Gold Country's hearing request also asserted
certain additional facts as affirmative defenses.  I do
not reach those additional assertions of fact, since my
conclusion is that HCFA has failed to present a prima
facie case.   
<P><A NAME="N_30_">30. </A>       HCFA filed also with its brief the declaration
of Ms. Meyers, whose name did not appear on the list of
potential witnesses for hearing drawn up by HCFA.  As
discussed in a later section of this Decision, Ms.
Meyers' declaration disclosed for the first time the
information she provided to the HCFA surveyors on
November 17, 1995.  HCFA Ex. 29.  

<P><A NAME="N_31_">31. </A>       I construe HCFA to be referring to its
interpretation of what is contained in the document which
was initially identified in its survey report/statement
of deficiencies as the "incident/accident" log  (<U>see</U> HCFA
Ex. 9 at 1) and which Gold Country has introduced as an
exhibit bearing the title of "Resident Allegation Log"
(P. Ex. 4).  I believe the parties have merely given
different names to the same document, since the dates for
the logs specified by Mr. Simpson in his declaration
(HCFA Ex. 30 at 4) are the same as those shown on Gold
Country's exhibit 4.  
<P><A NAME="N_32_">32. </A>       HCFA's "Directed Plan of Correction, Tag F-168"
(HCFA Ex. 10 at 5) does not contain any information
reflecting Mr. Simpson's stated concerns for Gold
Country's failure to report its residents' complaints to
an ombudsman.  
<P><A NAME="N_33_">33. </A>       An exit conference should be conducted as the
final task of the survey protocol.  42 C.F.R. §
488.110(j). The regulation explains how the surveyors
should conduct the exit conference, including what
information should be gathered or provided.  <U>Id</U>.
<P><A NAME="N_34_">34. </A>       I have received HCFA's new evidence into the
record, notwithstanding Gold Country's arguments
concerning the lack of prior notice and its effect on the
facility's due process rights.  Therefore, there is no
need for me to grant HCFA leave to submit a brief
containing its arguments on the due process issue.


<P>  
<P><A NAME="N_35_">35. </A>       Petitioner has also presented facts and
alternative arguments by applying HCFA's interpretation
of the regulation. 
<P><A NAME="N_36_">36. </A>       In this section, I am summarizing only HCFA's
arguments in response to Gold Country's interpretation of
the regulation.  As I discuss below, HCFA's finding of
noncompliance in this case reflects a different and
improper interpretation of the regulation at issue.
<P><A NAME="N_37_">37. </A>       Both of these statutory sections state that such
facilities must meet such other requirements relating to
the residents' health and safety as the Secretary may
find necessary.
<P><A NAME="N_38_">38. </A>       In proposing and promulgating the Part 483
regulations, the Secretary was acting through HCFA. 
<P><A NAME="N_39_">39. </A>       Subpart B of 42 C.F.R. Chapter IV contains Part
483, which is titled "Requirements for Long Term Care
Facilities."  The regulation relied upon by HCFA in this
case, 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2), is found in subpart B of
42 C.F.R. Chapter IV.
<P><A NAME="N_40_">40. </A>        Mr. Litwinovich's November 15, 1995 letter,
which was introduced by HCFA as one of its exhibits for
these proceedings, will be considered also to the extent
it helps explain the nature and context of Mr. Niehoff's
letter to him dated October 31, 1995. 
<P><A NAME="N_41_">41. </A>       As noted earlier, HCFA has recently submitted
the declaration of Mr. Simpson, who stated that "the
administrator did not deny that Gold Country had ceased
to cooperate with the Ombudsman's office" during the exit
conference on November 17, 1995.  HCFA Ex. 30 at 4.  Mr.
Simpson's version of what occurred during the exit
conference has been contested by Gold Country.  <U>See</U> P.
Reply and attached declarations.


<P>Notwithstanding the foregoing controversy, neither HCFA
nor Mr. Simpson contends that Mr. Niehoff and Mr.
Litwinovich have been contacted on November 17, 1995 or
since then.  It is undisputed that neither Mr. Niehoff
nor Mr. Litwinovich was at the aforementioned exit
conference.   
<P><A NAME="N_42_">42. </A>       In later parts of this Decision, I will discuss
HCFA's improper placement of an obligation on Gold
Country to mail or transmit materials or information from
the ombudsman to the residents; the lack of legally
cognizable relationship between Family Council meetings
and the requirements of 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2); as well
as the absence of any right under 42 C.F.R. §
483.10(g)(2) for family members (who have not been shown
to have the requisite legal standing to act on behalf of

<P>residents) to receive information from an ombudsman.  

<P><A NAME="N_43_">43. </A>       According to the content of Mr. Niehoff's
letter, the Family Council minutes were considered
"inflammatory and confrontational" by Mr. Niehoff because
he had earlier criticized Ms. Meyers' confrontational
approaches in the meetings of the Family Council, which
was allegedly made up by individuals under her influence
and attended by those who do not speak for the majority. 
HCFA Ex. 2.  
<P><A NAME="N_44_">44. </A>        For example, Mr. Litwinovich began his letter
thusly:


<P>	[m]y September 6 letter to you reflected an
effort to be conciliatory and responsive to the
concerns of Gold Country as you have expressed
them, to the degree possible without
compromising the obligations of the Long Term
Care Ombudsman Office.  Therefore, it was very
disappointing to receive your letter of October
31, which seemed to reflect a step in the
opposite direction.   


<P>HCFA Ex. 8 at 1.  Elsewhere in the letter, Mr.
Litwinovich described as a "rhetorical" question Mr.
Niehoff's query as to whether the ombudsman's mission was
to produce "inadequate care, loss of occupancy, and
bankruptcy."  <U>Id</U>.  Mr. Litwinovich stated in response, in

<P>the event the question was not rhetorical, "no, that is
not <U>her</U> mission."  <U>Id</U>. (emphasis added).  He indicated
his agreement in principle with Mr. Niehoff's observation
that an Ombudsman's office should work cooperatively and
professionally with the facilities.  <U>Id</U>. at 2. 
Therefore, even after disagreeing with the merits of the
complaints made against Ms. Meyers in Mr. Niehoff's
letter, Mr. Litwinovich noted also that he had discussed
with her certain expectations he has concerning the
performance of her work as an ombudsman; his expectations
were that she "make every reasonable effort to address
concerns in a positive, cooperative manner, and that she
fulfill her responsibilities as an Ombudsman."  <U>Id</U>. at 2. 

<P>I note also that, previous to submitting its brief
arguing that Mr. Niehoff's October 31 letter should be
interpreted "as a broad attack on the Ombudsman's program
which threatened to disrupt normal relations between the
Ombudsman and the residents . . ." together with witness
declarations alleging the same conclusions (HCFA Exs. 29,
30), HCFA's relevant position was only that Mr. Niehoff's
letter:


<P>	included attacks on the professionalism and
character of one ombudsman in particular 

<P>	. . . .


<P>HCFA Ex. 9 at 2. 
<P><A NAME="N_45_">45. </A>       I will discuss below the absence of facts in
support of Ms. Meyers' contentions that Gold Country was
curtailing her communications with residents.
<P><A NAME="N_46_">46. </A>       Mr. Litwinovich stated in his letter:


<P>	I can appreciate concerns about that [sic] the
mailing of minutes, which list perceived
problems, to all families.  It would seem
entirely appropriate to have a cooperative
discussion about the format of the minutes, the
scope of distribution, and how best to ensure a
positive approach.  While minutes should serve
to provide understanding and continuity to the
process of addressing concerns, and should
reflect the Family Council meeting business,
they should not unintentionally become a
negative public relations device, either for
the Family Council or for Gold Country.  This
is in the best interest of neither party.  If
it is a concern that this is happening, I would
recommend a meeting to resolve this issue.


<P>HCFA Ex. 8 at 1.


<P>In a later section of this Decision, I will discuss also
my conclusions that the evidence submitted by HCFA does
not establish that Gold Country was legally obligated to
mail out Family Council minutes under 42 C.F.R. §
483.10(g)(2).
<P><A NAME="N_47_">47. </A>       As I noted previously, all deficiencies do not
arise to the level of noncompliance, and the existence of
isolated deficiencies with a potential for only minimal
harm do not provided HCFA with the requisite basis for
finding noncompliance or for imposing an enforcement
remedy.  <U>See</U>, <U>e.g.</U>, 42 C.F.R. § 488.402(d)(2).  
<P><A NAME="N_48_">48. </A>        Here, I am not addressing the facility's
obligations in situations where residents, in exercising
their rights as residents under 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(1)
or other relevant regulations, have requested the
assistance or intervention of an ombudsman in the
residents' dealings with the facility.  I do not do so
because there is no allegation or evidence in this case
that the noncompliance determination at issue was reached
pursuant to any resident's request for the assistance or
intervention of an ombudsman.  Nor has HCFA found any
noncompliance with respect to the residents' exercise of
their regulatory rights at Gold Country.  <U>See</U> sections
VII-G(2), VII(H).   


<P>In a separate section of this Decision, I will discuss
HCFA's contention that Gold Country was out of compliance
with 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2) because it had failed to
communicate or report its residents' grievances to the
ombudsman.   
<P><A NAME="N_49_">49. </A>       In subsection VII-G(4) below, I reject HCFA's
evidence suggesting that Gold Country's residents were
discouraged from exercising their rights under 42 C.F.R.
§ 483.10(g)(2) by the contents of Mr. Niehoff's October
31, 1995 letter.
<P><A NAME="N_50_">50. </A>       For example, HCFA's surveyors stated in their
report/statement of deficiencies:


<P>	[t]his letter also charged that the minutes of
the September Family Council meeting were
"inflammatory and confrontational," which the
surveyor did not find to be true.  The letter
also included attacks on the professionalism
and character of one ombudsman in particular

<P>	 . . . - letters from the other two nursing
facilities . . . did not support Gold Country's
allegations. 


<P>HCFA Ex. 9 at 2.


<P>	Even if the merits of Mr. Niehoff's complaints
against Ms. Meyers were material to the regulatory
elements of 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2) (they are not
material), the evidence presented by HCFA is inadequate
to support its conclusion that those complaints were non-meritorious.  As I found previously, the two nursing home
administrators who complimented Ms. Meyers' work wrote
their letters at her request.  HCFA's surveyors never
interviewed either Mr. Niehoff or Mr. Litwinovich to
ascertain the factual bases of their respective opinions
concerning Ms. Meyers.  No resident was interviewed
regarding his or her interaction with Ms. Meyers.  Nor
did the surveyors interview any neutral observer of any
relevant event.  The surveyors solicited information from
only Ms. Meyers, whom they knew was being accused of
unprofessional conduct by Mr. Niehoff.    
<P><A NAME="N_51_">51. </A>        In earlier sections, I have discussed the
failure of HCFA's surveyors to review Mr. Litwinovich's
response letter dated November 15, 1995, HCFA's failure
to properly interpret the contents of said letter from
Mr. Litwinovich and HCFA's reliance upon the information
contained in Mr. Niehoff's October 31, 1995 letter as
proof of Gold Country's refusal to cooperate.  These
actions by HCFA indicate that it views the concept of
"cooperation" as extending only from the facility to the
ombudsman program, and not vice versa.    


<P>This view is also mirrored in the "Directed Plan of
Correction, Tag F-168" imposed by HCFA.  That plan states
that HCFA's determination of Gold Country's ongoing
compliance with the plan's requirements for re-establishing "open communication" and "cooperation" with
the ombudsman program will be "based on communication
between the ombudsman program and HCFA."  HCFA Ex. 10 at
5.  HCFA does not indicate it will be considering Gold
Country's views as to how the ombudsman program will be
"cooperating" or "openly communicating" with Gold
Country.  

<P> 
<P><A NAME="N_52_">52. </A>       I do not address Mr. Niehoff's additional
representation in the same sentence that Gold Country
"will not provide mailing addresses, as this information
is confidential."  HCFA Ex. 2 at 2.  HCFA has not
contended that the information is nonconfidential, or
that Gold Country should have made available the
addresses of families in order for the Ombudsman's office
to do its own mailings.
<P><A NAME="N_53_">53. </A>       HCFA also submitted an exhibit in which Gold
Country disputed HCFA's legal authority to require Gold
Country to distribute Family Council minutes or agenda
via the mail the facility sends out each month.  HCFA Ex.
11 at 3.
<P><A NAME="N_54_">54. </A>       In this decision, I use "communication" as an
abbreviation to denote the residents' right to receive
information from the ombudsman or the ombudsman's office,
as well as the residents' opportunity to contact the
ombudsman and the ombudsman's office, as guaranteed by 42
C.F.R. § 483.10(g)(2). 
<P><A NAME="N_55_">55. </A>       As I note also elsewhere in this Decision, HCFA
has not alleged nor found that Gold Country has failed in
its obligations to provide the residents with requisite
notice of their rights (<U>see</U> 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(b)(1)), to
post for its residents' information the names, addresses,
and telephone numbers of all pertinent client advocacy
agencies (<U>see</U> 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(b)(7)(iii)), to allow
its residents privacy in their written and telephonic
communications with any entity of their choice (<U>see</U> 42
C.F.R. § 483.10(i), (k)), and to allow an ombudsman to
have immediate access to the facility's residents (<U>see</U> 42
C.F.R. § 483.10(j)(iv)).
<P><A NAME="N_56_">56. </A>       The other portion of this regulation, that the
residents "be afforded the opportunity to contact these
agencies," is not relevant to my discussions in this
section.  
<P><A NAME="N_57_">57. </A>        The evidence does not establish the existence
of a resident council at Gold Country.
<P><A NAME="N_58_">58. </A>       Ms. Meyers states in her declaration:  


<P>	I have reviewed the October 31, 1995 letter
from William R. Niehoff to John Litwinovich,
the head of the El Dorado County Department of
Community Services.  I understand that this
letter has been designated as HCFA Exhibit 2 in
these proceedings.  When I first read this
letter in November 1995 I interpreted it as
another attempt to discredit me in my capacity
as Ombudsman and as an expression of Gold
Country's resolve not to cooperate with the
work of my office.  The attempt to rationalize
Gold Country's noncooperation with the
Ombudsman program on the basis of allegations
that I was not performing the responsibilities
of my office in a professional manner and that
other nursing homes in Placerville lacked
respect for my work were and are untrue, as
evidenced, in part, by the contemporaneous
correspondence from the administrators of those
nursing homes, which have been designated
herein as HCFA Exhibits 5 and 6.      


<P>HCFA Ex. 29 at 2-3, para. 4.
<P><A NAME="N_59_">59. </A>       42 C.F.R. § 488.26(c)(2) states in relevant
part:


<P>	(2) The survey process uses resident outcomes
as the primary means to establish the
compliance status of facilities.  


<P>According to HCFA's evidence, there was no resident
interviewed in this case.
<P><A NAME="N_60_">60. </A>        I have noted the following sentence in Ms.
Meyers' affidavit:


<P>	[t]he facility administration took actions to
disrupt and disband the regular Family Council
meetings -- during which <U>resident family
members</U> come together to exchange information
and discuss matters of mutual interest and
concern.


<P>HCFA Ex. 29 at 2 (emphasis added).  HCFA has not
contended that "resident family members" means residents
and family members, as opposed to residents' family
members, for example.  It is not possible to determine
the meaning of this phrase, as composed by Ms. Meyers. 


<P>However, even if I considered Ms. Meyers to have meant to
say in the above-quoted sentence that Gold Country was
attempting to disrupt and disband Family Council
meetings, which were being used by residents and their
family members to "come together to exchange information
and discuss matters of mutual interest and concern" (HCFA
Ex. 29 at 2), the regulation at issue, 42 C.F.R. §
483.10(g)(2), does not provide a right of communication
between residents and their families and does not concern
the residents' and family members' right to hold meetings
between themselves.    
<P><A NAME="N_61_">61. </A>       I will not summarize again my previous
conclusions that, given the state of HCFA's evidence, Ms.
Meyers' communications with family members are
immaterial. 
<P><A NAME="N_62_">62. </A>       This conclusion is also consistent with and
supported by a separate regulation which specifically
requires facilities to provide its residents with a
"statement that the resident may file a complaint <U>with
the State survey and certification agency</U> concerning
resident abuse, neglect, misappropriation of resident
property in the facility . . . ."  42 C.F.R. §
483.10(b)(7)(iv) (emphasis added).  HCFA has not alleged
or found any deficiency under 42 C.F.R. §
483.10(b)(7)(iv) in this case.  


<P>Additionally, there is no regulation or statute which
prohibits a resident from filing a complaint only with
the facility itself.  The regulations require only that
the facility undertake "[p]rompt efforts . . . to resolve
grievances the resident may have . . . ." 42 C.F.R. §
483.10(f)(2).

<P><A NAME="N_63_">63. </A>       HCFA evidence shows also that, under California
law, Gold Country must post similar information.  HCFA
Ex. 26.  The information posted pursuant to California
law must include not only the phone number of the area
ombudsman office, but also the number of the state-wide
"CRISISline," which is available 24 hours a day, seven
days a week, to receive complaints from residents.  <U>Id</U>. 
There is no indication from HCFA's evidence that the
"CRISISline" number was not posted by Gold Country as
required.</font>
