<b>Abstract <br><br></b>
With the help of the crystal structure of rhodopsin an ab initio method has been developed to calculate the three-dimensional structure of the loops that connect the transmembrane helices (TMHs). The goal of this procedure is to calculate the loop structures in other G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) for which only model coordinates of the TMHs are available. To mimic this situation a construct of rhodopsin was used that only includes the experimental coordinates of the TMHs while the rest of the structure, including the terminal domains, has been removed. To calculate the structure of the loops a method was designed based on Monte Carlo (MC) simulations which use a temperature annealing protocol, and a scaled collective variables (SCV) technique with proper structural constraints. Because only part of the protein is used in the calculations the usual approach of modeling loops, which consists of finding a single, lowest energy conformation of the system, is abandoned because such a single structure may not be a representative member of the native ensemble. Instead, the method was designed to generate structural ensembles from which the single lowest free energy ensemble is identified as representative of the native folding of the loop. To find the native ensemble a successive series of SCV-MC simulations are carried out to allow the loops to undergo structural changes in a controlled manner. To increase the chances of finding the native funnel for the loop, some of the SCV-MC simulations are carried out at elevated temperatures. The native ensemble can be identified by an MC search starting from any conformation already in the native funnel. The hypothesis is that native structures are trapped in the conformational space because of the high-energy barriers that surround the native funnel. The existence of such ensembles is demonstrated by generating multiple copies of the loops from their crystal structures in rhodopsin and carrying out an extended SCV-MC search. For the extracellular loops e1 and e3, and the intracellular loop i1 that were used in this work, the procedure resulted in dense clusters of structures with C-RMSD 0.5 . To test the predictive power of the method the crystal structure of each loop was replaced by its extended conformations. For e1 and i1 the procedure identifies native clusters with C-RMSD 0.5  and good structural overlap of the side chains; for e3, two clusters were found with C-RMSD 1.1  each, but with poor overlap of the side chains. Further searching led to a single cluster with lower C-RMSD but higher energy than the two previous clusters. This discrepancy was found to be due to the missing elements in the constructs available from experiment for use in the calculations. Because this problem will likely appear whenever parts of the structural information are missing, possible solutions are discussed.
