In Jacob's hierarchy of

physical, chemical, biological and social
objects [<A
 HREF="node24.html#Jacob1977">Jacob, 1977</A>],
molecular machines lie just inside the domain of biology,
because they perform specific functions for living systems.
Molecular biologists continuously unveil lovely examples of molecular machines

If we were to consider only one kind of molecular machine at a time,
we would miss the general features common to all molecular machines.
Therefore, throughout this paper we will refer to the following four
molecular machines.

<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.
<DD>The genetic material deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)
can act like a simple molecular machine.
If DNA is sheared into a heterogeneous population of
400 base-pair long fragments and then
heated (or denatured by other means),
the double stranded structure is ``melted'' into separate single
strands.  When the solution is slowly cooled, many of the single strands
bind to a complementary strand and reform the double helix
(Fig.&nbsp;<A HREF="node2.html#fig.operations">2</A>a) [<A
 HREF="node24.html#Britten1968">Britten &amp; Kohne, 1968</A>].

A. Single-stranded DNA will hybridize to become a double-stranded helix.  <BR>
B. <EM>Eco</EM>RI will scan along a DNA molecule and then bind specifically
to the sequence 5' GAATTC 3'.

<P>
Two characteristics make this reaction machine-like.
First, a priming step (denaturation) brings the molecules
into a high energy state.
Second, the molecules dissipate the energy and anneal to one another
in a reasonably precise way by using the complementarity
between bases [<A
 HREF="node24.html#WatsonCrick1953">Watson &amp; Crick, 1953</A>].
This ``hybridization'' reaction can be made so specific that it is widely
used as a technique in molecular biology
[<A
 HREF="node24.html#Britten1968">Britten &amp; Kohne, 1968</A>,<A
 HREF="node24.html#Maniatis1982">Maniatis <EM>et al.</EM>, 1982</A>,<A
 HREF="node24.html#Gibbs1989">Gibbs <EM>et al.</EM>, 1989</A>].
Base complementarity is also essential to all living things because it is the
basis of nucleic-acid replication.
For this reason, the degree of base-pairing
precision is important in evolution.

<P>
<DT>2.
<DD>The restriction enzyme
<EM>Eco</EM>RI is a protein which cuts duplex DNA between G and A in the sequence
5' GAATTC 3'[<A
 HREF="node24.html#Smith1979">Smith, 1979</A>,<A
 HREF="node24.html#McClarin1986">McClarin <EM>et al.</EM>, 1986</A>,<A
 HREF="node24.html#Rosenberg1987">Rosenberg <EM>et al.</EM>, 1987<EM>b</EM></A>].
A single molecule of <EM>Eco</EM>RI performs three machine-like operations [<A
 HREF="node24.html#Rosenberg1987.book">Rosenberg <EM>et al.</EM>, 1987<EM>a</EM></A>].
First, it can bind non-specifically to 
a DNA double helix.
Second, after sliding along the DNA until it reaches GAATTC, it will
bind specifically to that pattern.
Third, it cuts the DNA.
In the
absence of magnesium, binding is still specific but cutting does not occur,
so binding can be distinguished from cutting experimentally.
We will focus on the binding operation (Fig.&nbsp;<A HREF="node2.html#fig.operations">2</A>b).
As with DNA, two characteristics make this reaction
machine-like.
First, there is a priming operation in which the non-specific
binding to DNA places <EM>Eco</EM>RI into a ``high'' energy state relative
to its energy when it is bound specifically.
Second, the transition from non-specific to specific binding dissipates
this energy
so that <EM>Eco</EM>RI is located precisely on a GAATTC sequence.
Without a dissipation associated with the specific binding, <EM>Eco</EM>RI would quickly move away from its binding site.
After this <EM>local</EM> dissipation, the molecule is obliged to remain
in place until
it has cut the DNA, or a sufficiently large
thermal fluctuation kicks it off again.

<P>
<EM>In vivo</EM> cellular DNA is protected from <EM>Eco</EM>RI by the actions
of another enzyme called the modification methylase.
This enzyme attaches a methyl group to the second A in the sequence
GAATTC, so that <EM>Eco</EM>RI can no longer cut the sequence.
In contrast, invading foreign DNAs are liable to be destroyed
because they are unmethylated.
The methylase is precise, attaching the methyl only to GAATTC and not
to any of the sequences, such as CAATTC, that differ by only one base
from GAATTC [<A
 HREF="node24.html#Dugaiczyk1974">Dugaiczyk <EM>et al.</EM>, 1974</A>].
So <EM>in vivo</EM> <EM>Eco</EM>RI is exposed to many hexamer sequences that are
<EM>almost</EM> an <EM>Eco</EM>RI site, yet <EM>under optimal conditions</EM>
[<A
 HREF="node24.html#Polisky1975">Polisky <EM>et al.</EM>, 1975</A>,<A
 HREF="node24.html#Woodhead1981">Woodhead <EM>et al.</EM>, 1981</A>,<A
 HREF="node24.html#Pingoud1985">Pingoud, 1985</A>] it only cuts at GAATTC.
How a single molecule of <EM>Eco</EM>RI can
achieve this extraordinary precision has not
been understood [<A
 HREF="node24.html#Rosenberg1987.book">Rosenberg <EM>et al.</EM>, 1987<EM>a</EM></A>,<A
 HREF="node24.html#Needels1989">Needels <EM>et al.</EM>, 1989</A>,<A
 HREF="node24.html#Thielking1990">Thielking <EM>et al.</EM>, 1990</A>].

<P>
<DT>3.
<DD>The retina contains a protein called rhodopsin
which detects single photons of light [<A
 HREF="node24.html#Lewis1988">Lewis &amp; Priore, 1988</A>,<A
 HREF="node24.html#Wessling1987">Wessling-Resnick <EM>et al.</EM>, 1987</A>].
Upon capturing a photon, rhodopsin becomes excited
and then dissipates the energy.
Most of the time this converts rhodopsin into bathorhodopsin.
A chemical cascade then amplifies the bathorhodopsin ``signal'' 400,000 times,
leading to a nerve impulse.
Because of this enhancement we can see single photons of light.

<P>
Why doesn't rhodopsin merely ``use the energy'' to convert directly
into bathorhodopsin?
This transformation is not as easy as it first appears,
since the high energy state is a chemical transition state
from which it is possible
to go backwards to rhodopsin, rather than forwards to bathorhodopsin.
Rhodopsin must make a ``decision'' about what to do.

<P>
<DT>4.
<DD>Little is known about the exact molecular mechanism of
muscles [<A
 HREF="node24.html#Huxley1969">Huxley, 1969</A>,<A
 HREF="node24.html#McClare1971">McClare, 1971</A>,<A
 HREF="node24.html#Highsmith1983">Highsmith &amp; Jardetzky, 1983</A>,<A
 HREF="node24.html#Trayer1988">Trayer &amp; Trayer, 1988</A>].
However, we know that the interaction of the proteins
myosin and actin consumes the energy molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP).
We may therefore imagine that the hydrolysis of an ATP molecule
primes the actomyosin complex into a high energy state
so that as the energy is
dissipated a force is generated.
As with rhodopsin, the activated actomyosin complex must
``choose'' whether to go forwards or backwards.
