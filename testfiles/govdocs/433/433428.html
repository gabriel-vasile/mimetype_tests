<H3>LAMMPS Movies 
</H3>
<P>There are two kinds of movies on this page.  Some are from large-scale
simulations performed with LAMMPS (or its predecessor codes).  Others
are simple animations of (mostly) 2d problems that illustrate the
kinds of simulations that LAMMPS can be easily setup to run.  <A HREF = "pictures.html">This
page</A> has additional LAMMPS snapshots, but without
animations.
</P>
<P>The animations from large simulations were created using various
visualization packages to read LAMMPS output.

<H4><A NAME = "braze"></A>Brazing of two-metal system 
</H4>
<P>This is work by Ed Webb (ebwebb at sandia.gov) at Sandia and Jeff Hoyt
at McMaster University to study the interface between Cu and Ni under
conditions of brazing to join the metals.  A direct correlation
between the free energy of the dissolution reaction and the kinetics
of pore infiltration was observed.
</P>
<P>The snapshots and movie show liquid Cu infiltration into a 10 nm Ni
slit pore at 1750K.  Cu and Ni atoms are rendered as light and dark
spheres.  In the figure, results are shown for the non-dissolutive
(left) and the dissolutive (right) simulations at varying simulation
times: (a) t = 400 ps, (b) t = 900 ps and (c) t = 1400 ps.

<H4><A NAME = "impact"></A>Peridynamics mesoscale modeling of impact fracture 
</H4>
<P>This is work of Mike Parks at Sandia (mlparks at sandia.gov).  We
implemented a Peridynamics (PD) model in LAMMPS to enable meso- and
continuum-scale simulations of materials response.  PD is a
particle-based meshless continuum model that is well-suited for
hi-deformation problems, such as impact and fracture scenarios.  The
theory underlying PD was developed by Stewart Silling at Sandia
(sasilli at sandia.gov).
</P>
<P>In these images a 1 cm ball (not shown) moving at 100 m/sec impacts a
circular disk of brittle material composed of about 100K particles.
The timestep is 1 nsec and the simulation runs for 200K timesteps.

<H4><A NAME = "brittle"></A>Shear faults in a model brittle solid 
</H4>
<P>This is work due to Craig Maloney at CMU (craigmaloney at cmu.edu) and
<A HREF = "http://www.pha.jhu.edu/~mr/mr.html">Mark Robbins</A> at JHU.  They studied fracture in an idealized
2d brittle material using Lennard-Jones potentials and bonds.  Initial
bonds were inferred from nearby atom pairs in a quenched system, then
were allowed to break as the system was strained.  When the solid is
deformed, it can relax by breaking bonds, resulting in the damage
patterns shown in these figures for a model undergoing shear with 200K
particles.  The two images plot the sine of the local rotation angle
due to deformation in black/white and the autocorrelation of the local
rotation in color, evidencing strong anisotropy.  The right figure
plays a movie of the induced damage.

<P>This is work due to <A HREF = "http://www.egr.msu.edu/~priezjev">Nikolai Priezjev</A> (priezjev at
egr.msu.edu) and his group at Michigan State.  The first study is of
how fluid flow is affected by molecular-scale interactions at a
solid-liquid interface.  The solid surface is patterned with
alternating stripes with no-shear and finite-slip attributes, a flow
is induced in the liquid above the surface, and the dynamical
structure of the fluid is observed.  The second study is of short
polymer chains flowing over a rough surface.  The flow properties are
a function of the corrugation wavelength and chain length.  A fuller
description of these results is given

study how narrow cylindrical pores in silica can regulate the passage
water and ions in the presence of a pressure gradient for purposes of
desalination.  The animation shows amorphous SiO2 in transparent red
and yellow, ions in blue and cyan, and water molecules in red and
white.  Permeation can be calculated from such simulations as a
function of pore diameter, pore length, and pressure gradient
magnitude.

<H4><A NAME = "helium"></A>Metal response to helium bubble formation 
</H4>
<P>This is work due to Jon Zimmerman (jzimmer at sandia.gov) at Sandia.
It's a study of how helium bubble formation in a metal induces defect
formation.  As nanobubbles grow, they force the surrounding metal to
respond.  This movie is an animation of bubble growth in Pd.  Each
atom is colored by the value of its <A HREF = "doc/dump.html">centro-symmetry
parameter</A>, which is a measure of local crystal order;
only atoms at defects are visualized.

<H4><A NAME = "rubisco"></A>RuBisCO protein simulations 
</H4>
<P>This is work due to Paul Crozier (pscrozi at sandia.gov) at Sandia.  It's
a study of the properties of the RuBisCO enzyme which is a ubiquitous
protein involved in converting CO2 to organic forms of carbon and in
the photosynthetic process.  Sandia's <A HREF = "http://www.genomes2life.org">Genomes-to-Life</A> project is
focused on a species of cyanobacteria that uses RuBisCO.
</P>


<P>The first movie is an all-atom model (water not shown) with the
binding pocket in color.  Even though the pocket is closed, a CO2
molecule escapes, which was a surprise.  The 2nd movie uses implicit
solvent, freezes the protein background, and samples via parallel
tempering to model the closing of the binding pocket by the C-terminus
of the RuBisCO protein.
