        <p class="fontlarge">Located in Washington, DC, at the western end of 
          the National Mall, this four-sided stone structure (modeled after a 
          classic Egyptian <a href="../glossary.html#obelisk">obelisk</a>) honors 
          the &quot;Father of our Country,&quot; General, Founding Father, and 
          the first president of the United States (1789-1797), George Washington. 
        </p>
        <p class="fontlarge">At 555 feet 5 1/8 inches (169.29 meters) high, the 
          Washington Monument towers over everything in Washington, DC and is 
          one of the tallest masonry structures in the world. Fifty flags surround 
          the base of the Washington Monument and symbolize the 50 states of the 
          Union. If you take the elevator to the pyramid top, windows in the observation 
          room offer views of the Lincoln Memorial, the White House, the Thomas 
          Jefferson Memorial, and the Capitol building.</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p class="fontlarge"><b>NOTE: </b>Robert Mills' <a href="http://www.nps.gov/archive/wamo/memorial/design.htm">original 
            design</a> for the monument was greatly altered in the course of construction 
            and the present monument has little in common with Mills' elaborate 
            plan. His design, a combination of Greek and Egyptian architecture, 
            called for a 600 foot obelisk centered on a circular colonnaded pantheon, 
            250 feet in diameter and 100 feet high. It was to have 30 spaces set 
            aside between the columns to eventually be filled with statues of 
            prominent Americans, and over the entrance was to be a toga-clad Washington 
            driving a triumphal chariot.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p class="fontlarge">The cornerstone for the monument was laid on July 
          4, 1848, and the monument was opened to the public on October 9, 1888. 
          In total, there are 36,491 stones. Inserted into the interior walls 
          of the monument are 188 carved stones presented by individuals, societies, 
          cities, states, and nations of the world.</p>
        <p class="fontlarge">Did you know that there is a &quot;ring&quot; around 
          the monument? Due to several setbacks, the monument stood incomplete 
          at the height of about 150 feet for 25 years. Work resumed in 1880; 
          however, the new marble stones came from a different quarry than the 
          original. There is a discoloration on the outside of the obelisk that 
          clearly marks the older structure from the later one, even though it 
          is the same kind of marble. Since the marble came from three different 
          quarries, it was impossible to match the later marble to the older perfectly.</p>
        <p class="fontlarge"><b>The Reflecting Pool</b></p>
        <p class="fontlarge">Located between the Washington Monument and the Lincoln 
          Memorial lies the Reflecting Pool. This 2000x160 foot pool contains 
          7 million gallons of water. It was modeled after similar pools at Versailles 
          and the Taj Mahal. The design of the pool minimizes wind ripples and 
          sharpens the watery image of the monument.<br>
