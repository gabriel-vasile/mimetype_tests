SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

A. Background

    This interim rule amends DFARS part 225 and corresponding 
provisions and clauses to implement new Free Trade Agreements with 
Australia and Morocco, as approved by Congress in the United States-
Australia Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (Pub. L. 108-286) and 
the United States-Morocco Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (Pub. 
L. 108-302). The new Free Trade Agreements waive the applicability of 
the Buy American Act for some foreign supplies and construction 
materials from Australia and Morocco, and specify procurement 
procedures designed to ensure fairness. In addition, at the request of 
the United States Trade Representative and for consistency with the 
interim FAR rule published at 69 FR 77870 on December 28, 2004, this 
DFARS rule makes the following changes in terminology relating to trade 
agreements:
    <bullet> Substitution of the term ``World Trade Organization 
Government Procurement Agreement'' in all places where the term ``Trade 
Agreements Act'' was used to mean the World Trade Organization 
Government Procurement Agreement.
    <bullet> Redefinition of ``designated country'' to include World 
Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement countries, Free 
Trade Agreement countries, least developed countries, and Caribbean 
Basin countries. Free Trade Agreement countries and Caribbean Basin 
countries are now also designated countries. Each of these terms will 
retain a separate definition because, in some instances, the regulation 
does not apply to all designated countries, but only to some of the 
specific subsets.
    <bullet> A revised list of least developed countries that are 
designated as eligible countries under the Trade Agreements Act.
    <bullet> Amendment of the clause at DFARS 252.225-7045, Balance of 
Payments Program--Construction Material Under Trade Agreements, to 
extend nondiscriminatory treatment to all designated country 
construction material, including Caribbean Basin country construction 
material. Federal Register notices issued by the United States Trade 
Representative under the Caribbean Basin Trade Initiative state that 
products of the listed Caribbean Basin countries shall continue to be 
treated as eligible products (unless excluded from duty-free treatment 
under 19 U.S.C. 2703(b)). This change is consistent with the definition 
of ``eligible product'' at 19 U.S.C. 2518(4).
    This rule was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review 
under Executive Order 12866, dated September 30, 1993.

B. Regulatory Flexibility Act

    DoD does not expect this rule to have a significant economic impact 
on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the 
Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq. Although the rule 
opens up Government procurement to the products of Australia and 
Morocco, DoD does not believe there will be a significant economic 
impact on U.S. small businesses. DoD applies the trade agreements to 
only those non-defense items listed at DFARS 225.401-70. Acquisitions 
below $100,000 that are set aside for small businesses are exempt. 
Therefore, DoD has not performed an initial regulatory flexibility 
analysis. DoD invites comments from small businesses and other 
interested parties. DoD also will consider comments from small entities 
concerning the affected DFARS subparts in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 610. 
Such comments should be submitted separately and should cite DFARS Case 
2004-D013.

C. Paperwork Reduction Act

    This interim rule affects the certification and information 
collection requirements in the provisions at DFARS 252.225-7020 and 
252.225-7035, currently approved under Office of Management and Budget 
Control Number 0704-0229. The impact, however, is negligible.

D. Determination To Issue an Interim Rule

    A determination has been made under the authority of the Secretary 
of Defense that urgent and compelling reasons exist to publish an 
interim rule prior to affording the public an opportunity to comment. 
This interim rule implements new Free Trade Agreements with Australia 
and Morocco, as approved by Congress in the United States-Australia 
Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (Pub. L. 108-286) and the 
United States-Morocco Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (Pub. L. 
108-302). These agreements waive the applicability of the Buy American 
Act for some foreign supplies and construction materials from Australia 
and Morocco, and specify procurement procedures designed to ensure 
fairness. The new Free Trade Agreements became effective on January 1, 
2005. Comments received in response to this interim rule will be 
considered in the formation of the final rule.

    (ii) An end product manufactured in the United States if the 
cost of its qualifying country components and its components that 
are mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States exceeds 50 
percent of the cost of all its components. The cost of components 
includes transportation costs to the place of incorporation into the 
end product and U.S. duty (whether or not a duty-free entry 
certificate is issued). Scrap generated, collected, and prepared for 
processing in the United States is considered domestic. A component 
is considered to have been mined, produced, or manufactured in the 
United States (regardless of its source in fact) if the end product 
in which it is incorporated is manufactured in the United States and 
the component is of a class or kind for which the Government has 
determined that--
    (A) Sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities of 
a satisfactory quality are not mined, produced, or manufactured in 
the United States; or
    (B) It is inconsistent with the public interest to apply the 
restrictions of the Buy American Act.
    (3) End product means those articles, materials, and supplies to 
be acquired under this contract for public use.
    (4) End product of Australia, Canada, Chile, Mexico, or 
Singapore means an article that--
    (i) Is wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of Australia, 
Canada, Chile, Mexico, or Singapore; or
    (ii) In the case of an article that consists in whole or in part 
of materials from another country or instrumentality, has been 
substantially transformed in Australia, Canada, Chile, Mexico, or 
Singapore into a new and different article of commerce with a name, 
character, or use distinct from that of the article or articles from 
which it was transformed. The term refers to a product offered for 
purchase under a supply contract, but for purposes of calculating 
the value of the end product includes services (except 
transportation services) incidental to its supply, provided that the 
value of those incidental services does not exceed the value of the 
product itself.
    (5) Foreign end product means an end product other than a 
domestic end product.
    (6) Qualifying country means any country set forth in subsection 
225.872-1 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement.
    (7) Qualifying country component means a component mined, 
produced, or manufactured in a qualifying country.
    (8) Qualifying country end product means--
    (i) An unmanufactured end product mined or produced in a 
qualifying country; or
    (ii) An end product manufactured in a qualifying country if the 
cost of the following types of components exceeds 50 percent of the 
cost of all its components:
    (A) Components mined, produced, or manufactured in a qualifying 
country.
    (B) Components mined, produced, or manufactured in the United 
States.
    (C) Components of foreign origin of a class or kind for which 
the Government has determined that sufficient and reasonably 
available commercial quantities of a satisfactory quality are not 
mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States.
    (9) United States means the United States, its possessions, 
Puerto Rico, and any other place subject to its jurisdiction, but 
does not include leased bases or trust territories.

    (c) The Contractor shall deliver under this contract only 
domestic end products unless, in its offer, it specified delivery of 
qualifying country end products, end products of Australia, Canada, 
Chile, Mexico, or Singapore, or other foreign end products in the 
Buy American Act--Free Trade Agreements--Balance of Payments Program 
Certificate provision of the solicitation. If the Contractor 
certified in its offer that it will deliver a qualifying country end 
product or an end product of Australia, Canada, Chile, Mexico, or 
Singapore, the Contractor shall deliver a qualifying country end 
product, an end product of Australia, Canada, Chile, Mexico, or 
Singapore, or, at the Contractor's option, a domestic end product.

Trade Agreements.

    As prescribed in 225.7503(b), use the following clause:

Balance of Payments Program--Consturction Material Under Trade 
Agreements (Jan 2005)

    (a) Definitions. As used in this clause--
    Caribbean Basin country construction material means a 
construction material that---
    (1) Is wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of a Caribbean 
Basin country; or

[[Page 2366]]

    (2) In the case of a construction material that consists in 
whole or in part of materials from another country, has been 
substantially transformed in a Caribbean Basin country into a new 
and different construction material distinct from the materials from 
which it was transformed.
    Component means any article, material, or supply incorporated 
directly into construction material.
    Construction material means an article, material, or supply 
brought to the construction site by the Contractor or a 
subcontractor for incorporation into the building or work. The term 
also includes an item brought to the site preassembled from 
articles, materials, or supplies. However, emergency life safety 
systems, such as emergency lighting, fire alarm, and audio 
evacuation systems, that are discrete systems incorporated into a 
public building or work and that are produced as complete systems, 
are evaluated as a single and distinct construction material 
regardless of when or how the individual parts or components of 
those systems are delivered to the construction site. Materials 
purchased directly by the Government are supplies, not construction 
material.
    Cost of components means--
    (1) For components purchased by the Contractor, the acquisition 
cost, including transportation costs to the place of incorporation 
into the end product (whether or not such costs are paid to a 
domestic firm), and any applicable duty (whether or not a duty-free 
entry certificate is issued); or
    (2) For components manufactured by the Contractor, all costs 
associated with the manufacture of the component, including 
transportation costs as described in paragraph (1) of this 
definition, plus allocable overhead costs, but excluding profit. 
Cost of components does not include any costs associated with the 
manufacture of the construction material.

Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, or the United Kingdom);
    (2) A Free Trade Agreement country (Australia, Canada, Chile, 
Mexico, Morocco, or Singapore);
    (3) A least developed country (Afghanistan, Angola, Bangladesh, 
Benin, Bhutan, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cambodia, Cape Verde, Central 
African Republic, Chad, Comoros, Democratic Republic of Congo, 
Djibouti, East Timor, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gambia, 
Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Kiribati, Laos, Lesotho, Madagascar, 
Malawi, Maldives, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Nepal, Niger,

Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, British Virgin Islands, Costa Rica, 
Dominica, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Grenada, Guatemala, 
Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Montserrat, Netherlands Antilles, 
Nicaragua, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the 
Grenadines, or Trinidad and Tobago).
    Designated country construction material means a construction 
material that is a WTO GPA country construction material, a Free 
Trade Agreement country construction material, a least developed 
country construction material, or a Caribbean Basin country 
construction material.
    Domestic construction material means--
    (1) An unmanufactured construction material mined or produced in 
the United States; or
    (2) A construction material manufactured in the United States, 
if the cost of its components mined, produced, or manufactured in 
the United States exceeds 50 percent of the cost of all its 
components. Components of foreign origin of the same class or kind 
for which nonavailability determinations have been made are treated 
as domestic.
    Free Trade Agreement country construction material means a 
construction material that--
    (1) Is wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of a Free 
Trade Agreement country; or
    (2) In the case of a construction material that consists in 
whole or in part of materials from another country, has been 
substantially transformed in a Free Trade Agreement country into a 
new and different construction material distinct from the material 
from which it was transformed.
    Least developed country construction material means a 
construction material that--
    (1) Is wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of a least 
developed country; or
    (2) In the case of a construction material that consists in 
whole or in part of materials from another country has been 
substantially transformed in a least developed country into a new 
and different construction material distinct from the materials from 
which it was transformed.
    United States means the 50 States and the District of Columbia, 
U.S. territories and possessions, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana 
Islands, and any other place subject to U.S. jurisdiction, but does 
not include leased bases.

substantially transformed in a WTO GPA country into a new and 
different construction material distinct from the materials from 
which it was transformed.
    (b) This clause implements the Balance of Payments Program by 
providing a preference for domestic construction material. In 
addition, the Contracting Officer has determined that the WTO GPA 
and Free Trade Agreements apply to this acquisition. Therefore, the 
Balance of Payments Program restrictions are waived for designated 
country construction materials.
    (c) The Contractor shall use only domestic or designated country 
construction material in performing this contract, except for--
    (1) Construction material valued at or below the simplified 
acquisition threshold in part 2 of the Federal Acquisition 
Regulation; or
    (2) The construction material or components listed by the 
Government as follows:
    [Contracting Officer to list applicable excepted materials or 
indicate ``none'']
    (End of clause)

Alternate I (Jan 2005)

    As prescribed in 225.7503(b), delete the definitions of 
``designated country'' and ``designated country construction 
material'' from the definitions in paragraph (a) of the basic 
clause, add the following definition of ``Australian, Chilean, or 
Moroccan construction material'' to paragraph (a) of the basic 
clause, and substitute the following paragraphs (b) and (c) for 
paragraphs (b) and (c) of the basic clause:
    Australian, Chilean, or Moroccan construction material means a

    (b) This clause implements the Balance of Payments Program by 
providing a preference for domestic construction material. In 
addition, the Contracting Officer has determined that the WTO GPA 
and all Free Trade Agreements except NAFTA apply to this 
acquisition. Therefore, the Balance of Payments Program restrictions 
are waived for WTO GPA country, Australian, Chilean, or Moroccan, 
least developed country, or Caribbean Basin country construction 
material.
    (c) The Contractor shall use only domestic, WTO GPA country, 
Australian, Chilean, or Moroccan, least developed country, or
