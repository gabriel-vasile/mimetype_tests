	  <p>Juneteenth is arguably one of the most important days in our country’s history as well as African American history.  On this day 140 years ago, this country made a good faith effort to live up to the principals it was founded on:   liberty and justice for <u>all</u>.  The Emancipation Proclamation, signed by President Abraham Lincoln, was put into effect on January 1, 1863, but news of the Proclamation and enforcement did not reach Texas until after the end of the Civil War almost two years later.</p>

<p>The Proclamation was a shrewd and strategic move to strengthen Union troops in the south by enlisting newly freed slaves and at the same time crippling the economy of the confederate states by reducing the free labor they depended on for their primary industry, farming.  It was a good plan and while it was not a decision based on moral grounds, Blacks finally got an opportunity to taste freedom in this country and begin the long and difficult struggle for equality, a struggle that continues today.</p>      

<p>Southern states in the confederacy were not ready to give up their fight to secede or give up their way of life, which was made possible in large part through the blood, sweat and tears of African slaves.  One by one as battles were fought and won by Union soldiers, enforcement of the Emancipation Proclamation swept through the south.  The final strong hold was Texas.</p>  
 
<p>Texas state leaders fled to Mexico refusing to live under Yankee control and fearing retribution for their role in the Confederacy.  Finally, Union General Gordon Granger arrived in Texas to reign in the complete chaos that had taken hold and at that point, and on June 19, 1865 news of the Emancipation Proclamation reached slaves in Texas and Juneteenth was born.</p>  

<p>The long and arduous tale of the emancipation of Texas slaves is symbolic of the struggle of all African Americans and the day, June 19, or Juneteenth as it was known, became the commemoration and embodiment of African American freedom.</p>   

<p>Today, Juneteenth is a celebration that recognizes and honors African American achievements in education and economic prosperity.  The observance varies from state to state, but the spirit remains true.  It is a time for reflection, self-improvement and planning for the future. It is a day on which we honor and pay respect for the sufferings of slavery. It is a day on which we acknowledge the evils of slavery and its aftermath.  On Juneteenth we should talk about our history and realize that because of it, there will forever be a bond between us.</p> 

<p>On Juneteenth we think about that moment in time when the enslaved in Galveston, Texas received word of their freedom.  We imagine the depth of their emotions, their jubilant dance and their fear of the unknown.  For one day we as a country can truthfully acknowledge a period in our history that shaped and continues to influence our society today.</p> 

<p>Only with sensitivity to the conditions and experiences of others can we then make significant and lasting improvements in our society as a whole.  On Juneteenth, we come together to learn and to refresh the drive to achieve. It is a day where we all take one step.</p>
