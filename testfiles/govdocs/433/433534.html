work, Young and Gordon were confident that the flared tube
configuration, with its very small combustion chamber, was the best
design for the thrust chamber of 13.3 kilonewtons (3000 lb thrust).
They intended to use a porous inner wall but were still undecided
about the coolant. They decided to determine the relative merits of
both water and liquid hydrogen as transpiration coolants. They also
planned to study injection methods for liquid hydrogen. Stary was
studying the same things at Ohio State University and had just made
his first run using liquid hydrogen (</FONT><FONT

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">From mid-1947 to mid-1948, the Aerojet men
made few thrust chamber tests. None was made with liquid hydrogen,
for the liquefier was not yet in operation. The major experimental
work was an investigation of the performance loss at sea level in
operating a nozzle designed for maximum performance at
altitude.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[</FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">52</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] The force produced
by a nozzle from expanding exhaust gases is the result of a momentum
force and two pressure forces. One of the pressure forces aids the
momentum force and the other opposes it. An ideal nozzle is one that
expands the exhaust gases from the pressure in the combustion chamber
to the outside ambient pressure. The nozzle thereby maximizes the
momentum force and the two pressure forces cancel each other. Since a
rocket nozzle is a fixed design, the designer must choose a single
ambient pressure for his design. If he chooses sea-level pressure, he
gets less than optimum performance at altitude; if he chooses a lower
pressure corresponding to some altitude, he theoretically loses
performance at sea level. Since much of the operation occurs at
reduced ambient pressure, the designer usually wishes to make the
nozzle as large as mass and size restrictions permit. The question at
Aerojet was: What penalty would result from sea-level operation of a
nozzle designed for best operation at altitude? In experiments with a
small rocket chamber they found, to their great joy, that the actual
performance loss was much less than theoretically predicted their
nozzle designed for altitude had only a 10 percent loss at sea
level.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Aerojet was still committed to transpiration
cooling but had encountered a series of new and worrisome material
problems. It was difficult to obtain porous materials of uniform
permeability-but worse yet, the porous structure became clogged in
unpredictable and nonuniform ways. These problems began to raise
doubts about using the flared tube configuration as well as
transpiration cooling. When the project received new funding and
directions in mid-1948, Aerojet planned to use a group of thrust
chambers of various sizes and shapes, as well as a variety of
injection methods. The engineers believed regenerative cooling would
be possible with either oxygen or hydrogen, or both. Preparations
were made to study the heat transfer properties of oxygen and
hydrogen by means of an electrically heated tube. All of these
activities signaled a major change in direction by Aerojet, from
emphasis on their flared tube design using transpiration cooling to a
conventional plenum thrust chamber with regenerative cooling. It was
about this time, mid-1948, that George H. Osborn became the chief
test engineer.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The first Aerojet test with liquid hydrogen
and oxygen was made on 20 January 1949 with a 1780-newton (400 lb
thrust) chamber. By the end of March, 10 runs had been made with
disappointingly low exhaust velocities-about 2920 meters per second
or 82 percent of theoretical. Of equal concern was the unsteady
operation, or "chugging," which indicated unstable combustion. The
injector, designed by Osborn, used a diverging cone of liquid oxygen
intersecting a converging sheet of liquid hydrogen. The only good
news was a low heat transfer rate, which was attributed to incomplete
combustion.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In the midst of all the bad experimental
results came the worst news of all. On 2 March 1949, as previously
mentioned, the Bureau of Aeronautics directed Aerojet to change the
fuel from liquid hydrogen to anhydrous hydrazine, but allowed the
experiments with liquid hydrogen to continue for the three months
remaining in the contract. No evidence has been found that Aerojet
protested this change- perhaps it [</FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">53</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] was welcomed after
the first series of experiments with liquid hydrogen. However, the
Aerojet designers were determined to do a creditable job with liquid
hydrogen in the time remaining and the record shows that they did.
The key was injector design.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Osborn was designing new injectors even before
all the dismal results with the spray type were in. The second design
was a "showerhead" type with 115 fuel and oxidizer holes across the
face and 30 fuel holes around the circumference for film cooling. The
film, or layer, of fuel-rich gas next to the chamber and nozzle walls
kept them cool. The design gave low performance and failed
structurally on 4 April, three months before the end of the
contract.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The pressure on the team to succeed must have
been great. Fortunately, Osborn had designed a third injector, called
a multitube concentric orifice, in March and it proved to be highly
successful. Liquid hydrogen was injected through a number of
thin-walled tubes surrounded by an annular flow of liquid oxygen, as
illustrated by figure 10. For....</FONT></P>

(400-lb-thrust) chamber, 61 of these "tubes within tubes" provided a
very fine degree of mixing. As in the previous design, axial orifices
were spaced around the circumference for hydrogen film cooling. Two
runs with this injector gave an exhaust velocity of 3590 meters per
second, or virtually 100 percent of theoretical. The propellants
mixed so well that combustion occurred very close to the injector
face and burned it. Osborn sought to correct this with design
changes, but the fix did not work as well as the original design.
However, he knew how he wanted to design the 13-kilonewton
(3000-lb-thrust) injector. When he signed the drawing for it on 5
May, there were less than two months left to complete the work. The
injector had 489 sets of circular oxygen orifices surrounding
hydrogen tubes, plus 60 hydrogen orifices for a fuel-rich layer at
the walls. The thrust chamber, which had been designed and fabricated
earlier, was a conventional plenum chamber, water cooled, with an
inner liner of copper. The copper was machined from a solid billet
and its size limited the nozzle design so that it was not
ideal.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

FACE="Geneva"> Starting on 27 May three successful runs were made
with this engine at pressures from 24 to 31 atmospheres. Exhaust
velocities of 3380 to 3520 meters per second were obtained,
approaching 95 percent of theoretical performance. On 16 June, with
two weeks to go before the contract expired, they attempted to make a
fourth run, but an explosion occurred in the liquid hydrogen
propellant system-the second in that system. Aerojet attributed the
cause to contamination of the liquid hydrogen with solid oxygen. That
ended Aerojet's rocket experiments with liquid hydrogen.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In reporting the results, Osborn and Wayne D.
Stinnett included experiments by Gordon on heat transfer and
injectors using a smaller, water-cooled engine where the multitube,
concentric injector had initially proved successful. Heat transfer
rates were reported as excessive for both engines, leading the
authors to conclude that additional film cooling over that used in
the larger engine would be necessary. Although they had not fulfilled
the objective of a self-cooled, lightweight rocket engine using
liquid hydrogen-oxygen, the investigators believed that their results
were highly encouraging, and no fundamental difficulties were
encountered. From their rapid progress during the last four months of
the contract, there is little doubt that Aerojet was on the right
track in thrust chamber design and with additional work would have
been able to perfect self-cooling. Concurrent with their work, Dwight
I. Baker at nearby Jet Propulsion Laboratory was doing just
that.</FONT></P>
