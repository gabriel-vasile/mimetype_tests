<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
This LIB describes a solid phase extraction and cleanup procedure for the determination of
chloramphenicol residues in shrimp and crab. Chloramphenicol is detected, after
chromatographic separation, using a Thermo Electron TSQ <i>Quantum</i> triple quadrupole mass
spectrometer with an ESI source operating in negative ion mode. An internal standard is used
to correct for variability of extraction and instrument response. Four product ions of
chloramphenicol and one product ion of the internal standard are monitored using selected
reaction monitoring (SRM). Chloramphenicol can be quantitated and confirmed at the 0.1ppb
level.
</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
Recently it has been reported that the antibiotic chloramphenicol (CAP) has been found in
several imported foodstuffs from Asia, including shrimp, crab and crayfish. Initially, several
confirmatory analytical LC/MS/MS methods for chloramphenicol using ion trap detection were
developed by the Denver District Animal Drugs Research Center (ADRC) of FDA to address this
problem. Specifically, LIBs 4284, 4287, 4294, 4281 (1-4) describe methods developed to
qualitatively confirm CAP in shrimp, crayfish, crab, and honey, respectively, at 1ppb or
higher. Using these methods over the last year, several FDA laboratories have positively
confirmed the presence of CAP in many import samples of the aforementioned foods. These
methods employ negative ion mode with electrospray ionization. In these methods full scan
MS<sup>2</sup> spectra were obtained not only from the parent CAP ion (m/z=321), but also
from the corresponding m/z =323 ion M+2 (<sup>35</sup>Cl, <sup>37</sup>Cl) isotope. The ion
trap full scan data gave excellent positive identification but was not quite as successful
for precise quantitation or sensitive enough to detect sub-ppb CAP levels. It was requested
that a more sensitive confirmatory method for CAP be developed for use in the field.
</p><p>
To gain this added sensitivity, typically a triple quadrupole LC/MS/MS operating in Selected
Reaction Monitoring or SRM mode is used. In SRM, instead of monitoring the entire mass
spectrum of the product ions of a parent ion, only a few selected product ions are monitored.
Seattle District Laboratory has recently developed a triple quadrupole Finnigan TSQ 7000
LC/MS/MS method (5) for the analysis of CAP in shrimp (LIB 4290) which seems to work well
with a LOQ of 0.3ppb and a LOD of 0.08ppb. However, our newer model triple quadrupole
instrument (a TSQ Quantum, also using negative ion mode ESI LC/MS/MS) gave appreciable
downward drift in response to chloramphenicol after many injections during a run sequence,
possibly due to ion suppression. Another FDA laboratory (verbal communication) has also
experienced a similar effect operating in negative ion mode. For this reason we would not be
able to use the Seattle method without an internal standard.
</p><p>
This LIB describes an additional method for the LC/MS/MS detection of chloramphenicol in
shrimp and crab. Differences between our method and the Seattle method include:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>An internal standard (IS), meta-Chloramphenicol or m-CAP, is added at the beginning of
the extraction in our method. The use of an internal standard self-corrects for any extraction
variability from sample to sample and should also self -correct for any drift in detector
response during a run. With the use of an IS, 0.1ppb CAP levels in tissue can be reliably
quantitated.</p></li>
 
<li><p>The extraction employed in our method does not use separatory funnels but uses
disposable glassware to minimize the possibility of cross-contamination.</p></li>
 
<li><p>A mobile phase of only acetonitrile and water without any salt buffers is used in our
method which should help minimize MS maintenance.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3>Overview of method</h3>
<p>
The extraction used in the method described in this LIB is a simplified version of that
described in LIB 4284. Ten grams of tissue composite (with added m-CAP internal standard) is
extracted (3x) in ammoniated ethyl acetate. The combined extracts are evaporated and
re-dissolved in water. A hexane wash removes fats. The extract is then applied to a
reverse-phase SPE column and the CAP is eluted with methanol. The methanol is evaporated to
dryness and the extract is reconstituted in water, filtered and injected into the LC/MS for
analysis. The m/z 321 [M-H] ion for both CAP and the internal standard m-CAP is isolated in
Q1, with five product ions isolated in Q3. Confirmation of CAP is made by comparison of ion
chromatogram peaks with those of a CAP standard. Quantitation of CAP is made by taking the
ratio of the CAP base peak area (m/z 152) to the internal standard m-CAP base peak area
(m/z 207). This MS approach is an adaptation (as per a manuscript kindly provided to Denver
Laboratory by FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine) of a Canadian method (6). The Canadian
method's HPLC column with a modified mobile phase is used in this LIB. Also we found that by
adding the internal standard m-CAP at the beginning of the extraction instead of at the end
increased the reproducibility of the method. Finally, we also used a higher level of internal
standard (0.3ppb) to give a more intense response.

<h3>Internal Standard preparation: <span class="head3">(fortification solution preparation is
in italics).</span></h3>
<p>
The internal standard used is m-chloramphenicol (m-CAP), was custom synthesized for the FDA.
</p>
<ol>
<li>A 100&micro;g/mL <b>stock standard</b> m-CAP solution in acetonitrile (acn) is
prepared.</li>
<li>A 1:100 dilution in acn of the stock standard gives an <b>intermediate standard</b>
concentration of 1&micro;g/mL or 1000ng/mL m-CAP.</li>
<li>Three mL of the intermediate standard is diluted to 500mL with water to give a m-CAP
concentration of 6ng/mL <b>diluent solution</b> (This diluent solution is used to prepare the
LC/MS standards).</li>
<li><i>Five mL of the intermediate standard is diluted to 250mL with water to give the m-CAP
<b>fortification solution</b> of 20ng/mL. Every 10.0g sample is fortified with 150&micro;L of
m-CAP fortification solution for a 0.3ppb IS (internal standard) concentration--this is
equivalent to a 6ng/mL final vial concentration of m-CAP.</i>
</ol>
<h3>Chloramphenicol std preparation: <span class="head3">(preparation of fortification
solutions in italics).</span></h3>
<p>
Chloramphenicol standard used is the current USP lot.
</p>
<ol>
<li>A 100&micro;g/mL <b>stock standard</b> CAP solution in acetonitrile (acn) is
prepared.</li>
<li>A 1:100 dilution <u>with m-CAP diluent</u> of the stock standard gives an <b>intermediate
standard</b> concentration of 1&micro;g/mL or 1000ng/mL CAP.</li>
<li>A 1:10 dilution of the intermediate CAP standard <u>with m-CAP diluent</u> gives a
100ng/mL CAP concentration standard equivalent to a <b>5ppb CAP standard</b>.</li>
<li> A 6:10 and 4:10 dilution of the 5ppb CAP standard <u>with m-cap diluent</u> gives
<b>3ppb</b> and <b>2ppb standards</b> respectively. A 5.00mL to 25.00mL dilution with m-cap
diluent gives a <b>1ppb CAP standard</b>.</li>
<li>A 6.00, 3.00, 1.00, and 0.00 mL dilution of the 1ppb CAP standard to 10.00mL <u>with m-CAP
diluent</u> gives <b>0.6, 0.3, 0.1, and 0ppb CAP standards</b> respectively. The 1.0, 0.6,
0.3 and 0.1ppb CAP standards will have CAP concentrations of 20, 12, 6, and 2ng/mL
respectively. The 0.3ppb standard can be used as the CCV solution. A similar, but prepared
with a different CAP stock solution, 0.1ppb ICV CAP standard <u>(but using the same diluent
solution)</u> is also prepared.</li>
<li><i>Preparation of CAP fortification solutions. (These solutions <u>do not</u> have m-cap
diluent in them but are diluted with water). Using the 100ug/mL CAP stock solution above a
1:100 dilution is made with water; 1.00mL of this solution is diluted to 10mL with water to
give CAP fortification solution #1 of 100ng/mL concentration. A 2:10 dilution of fortification
solution #1 gives fortification solution #2 of 20ng CAP/mL in water. For 10.0g tissue, prepare
a 0.1ppb spike by adding 50&micro;L of fortification solution #2. Prepare a 0.3ppb spike by
adding 30&micro;L of fortification solution #1. Prepare a 0.6ppb spike by adding 60&micro;L of
fortification solution #1 and so on.</i></li>
</ol>
<h3>Sample preparation</h3>
<ol>
<li>Place peeled (if applicable) tissue in blender, and blend with dry ice using robot coupe
mixer with pulsed action until contents are uniform (7).</li>
<li>Accurately weigh (to the nearest tenth of a gram) 10.0g of blended meat composite into a
50 mL polypropylene (P/P) centrifuge tube. Fortify as described in the standard preparation
section.</li>
<li>Add 20 mL of extraction solution (EtOAC:NH<sub>4</sub>OH, 98:2) homogenize with vortexer
until the entire mass is broken up (about 30 sec). Mix on pulsed Multitube Vortexer for 10
minutes.</li>
<li>Centrifuge for 7 min @ 4000 rpm, decant into another 50mL polypropylene centrifuge tube
and place in N-Evap set at 50<sup>o</sup>C to begin evaporation under nitrogen.</li>
<li>Repeat extraction steps 3and 4 two more times, combining the extracts.</li>
<li>Finish evaporating to dryness under nitrogen.</li>
<li>Add 30mL of 0.05% acetic acid in H<sub>2</sub>O to dried extract, vortex ca. 1 min to
loosen residue then continue to vortex a minimum of 5 min.</li>
<li>Add 10 mL of hexane to the 50mL tube, and cap. Invert tube gently several times so that
emulsions do not form but ensure any solids are dissolved, centrifuge 3 min at 4000 rpm.
Aspirate with disposable pipette and discard hexane layer. Repeat hexane de-fatting step twice
more with two additional 5mL portions of hexane and on the final wash remove any surface
lipid-like material at interface between the hexane and water.</li>
<li>Condition each C<sub>18</sub> SPE column with 3 mL MeOH followed by 3 mL H<sub>2</sub>O.
Transfer aqueous extract to a conditioned SPE system consisting of a C<sub>18</sub> SPE column
on bottom, with a 70 mL reservoir on top. The reservoir should have a Varian disposable filter
on the bottom. With a vacuum manifold, allow flow through at about 1 drop/sec. Apply positive
pressure if necessary for clogged units. Remove the 70mL reservoir.</li>
<li>Wash with 2mL water. Allow cartridges to run dry and pull vacuum for about 2min. Elute
the C<sub>18</sub> SPE with two, 2 mL MeOH volumes into a 15mL disposable P/P centrifuge tube.
Evaporate MeOH eluate to dryness in an automatic TurboVap under nitrogen with water-bath set
at 50&deg;C.</li>
<li>The dried extracts are reconstituted into 0.5mL water by vortexing for 5 min to dissolve
residue, and syringe-filtered through an Acrodisc membrane for injection into LC-MS
system.</li>

<h3>Instrument Operating Parameters</h3>
<ol>
<li>Perform instrument verification check using polytyrosine (prepared as per instrument
manual and containing tyrosine, as well as the trimer and the hexamer of tyrosine) to verify
correct mass axis, sensitivity of Q1, resolution, and MS<sup>2</sup> product ion collision
energy and sensitivity.</li>
<li>A standard mixture should be analyzed initially to determine the retention times of CAP
and m-CAP. The retention time should be within &plusmn; 5% of what was observed for standards
previously (unless column or mobile phase have been changed). It may require one or two
injections of standard for retention times to stabilize if instrument has not been used
recently.</li>
<li>The response for 75 &micro;L injection of a 0.1 ppb standard (2ng/mL) for CAP should have
a S/N&gt;200:1 for the 321-&gt; 152 MS<sup>2</sup> transition.</li>
<li>Typical MS fore pump pressure (torr) for our TSQ were 0.98 to 1. Typical ion gauge
pressure (torr) is around 8e-6.</li>
<li>ESI source probe angle=60&deg;</li>
<li>Note: The tune file for CAP was obtained by syringe infusion of a 10ng/&micro;L
chloramphenicol in water standard and adding LC flow (200&micro;L/min 35% acn, 65% water
mobile phase) through a tee. By doing this one of the parameters optimized was the spray
voltage which gave an optimal value (for 321 response) of 4kV. A metal sample tube (50&micro;m
high flow size) instead of a fused silica tube was installed in the TSQ. (A metal sample tube
is less susceptible to attack from acetonitrile). Practical operation of the instrument
revealed, however, that in negative ion mode the MS began to give, with successive injections,
too high of a spray current (up to 60&micro;amps) when the LC flow was diverted to the MS
during a run. To lower arcing, a lower spray voltage of 1500V was chosen. This greatly lowered
the spray current and did not seem to adversely affect 321 sensitivity significantly.
The MS/MS was also optimized for CAP: specifically the MS<sup>2</sup> SRM responses of the
CAP 321 parent ion (176, 194, 257, 152) were optimized for their respective collision
energies. And similarly, the MS/MS was also optimized for m-CAP 207 product ion.<br />

Aux gas pressure=18<br />
Capillary temperature=350&deg;C<br />
Tube lens offset=70<br />
Collision pressure (argon)=1.5torr</li>
<li>Typical operating pressures of a new column with guard (see equipment and reagents
section) using initial LC parameters is about 2200psi. and m-CAP typically elutes at 4.5min,
CAP at 5 min (see Figs. 1-3). Also, although m-CAP and CAP elute when the LC mobile phase is
35% acetonitrile, for some dirtier matrices a further column rinse gradient up to 90%
acetonitrile was needed (see LC gradient table below).</li>

For positive CAP confirmation, the CAP MS<sup>2</sup> ions of 152, 176, 194, and 257 should
all be present at the same retention time (within 5%) as that of standard CAP. These ions
should each be present with area abundances of at least one-half the abundance of the 0.1ppb
CAP spike. The m-CAP should be present in all samples and the 207 m-CAP SRM should be present
at the same retention time (within 5%) as compared to that of standard m-cap for positive
confirmation of the internal standard.
</p><p>
Using the collision energies as specified in the instrument SRM table, the CAP MS<sup>2</sup>
product ions have the following <i>average</i> peak area ratios for multiple injections of CAP
standards (normalized to the 152 ion as 100%).

<p>
As part of the confirmation criteria for CAP, any presumptive CAP tissue positive must have
similar ion abundance ratios to the average of the CAP standards (within 10% absolute
difference). CAP tissue spikes in our laboratory typically gave % RSD's of &lt;5% for ion peak
area ratios.
</p><p>
For CAP quantitation, use m/z 321&gt;152 peak area for CAP response and m/z 321&gt;207 peak
area for m-CAP response. Construct a calibration curve using all standards (including the zero
standard) using the ratio of [(CAP 152)/(m-CAP 207)] responses vs. CAP concentration in ng/mL.
Determine the concentration of the sample extract from the calibration curve. Calculate the
corresponding tissue concentration by: (assuming an initial 10g tissue portion, and a final
vial (extract) volume of 0.5mL)
</p><p>
[ng/g x (10g/0.5mL)]=ng/mL or [ ppb x 20] = ng/mL, or
</p><p>
<b>Tissue ppb=[extract conc. in ng/mL]/20</b>
</p>
<h3>Results and Discussion</h3>
<p>
The MS response to chloramphenicol was found to have a limited linear range. To quantitate at
levels around 0.1ppb, a linear standard curve from 0 to 1ppb can be used (such curves gave
correlation coefficients (r) of &gt;0.995). However, to quantitate at both low and high
(&gt;1ppb CAP) levels a quadratic fit curve over a range of 0 to 5ppb was sometimes found to
work better. Although a linear fit curve from 0-5ppb CAP might still have a r value of
&gt;0.995, using this curve often would adversely affect quantitation at low levels of 0.1ppb.
(See figs 4 and 5).
</p><p>
Using an internal standard, repeat injections of a CAP standard (or CCV standard) should
easily give values of &lt;25% difference from the initial value. Similarly, an injection of an
independently made CAP standard (or ICV standard) should also easily give an agreement within
25% of the CCV CAP standard. A 0.1ppb CAP standard (2ng/mL CAP) gave an average
signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 800:1 for SRM 152 and an average S/N ratio of 1400:1 for SRM
207 (m-CAP internal standard at 6ng/mL or 0.3ppb m-CAP-see Fig. 1).
</p><p>
Quantitation of 0.1ppb CAP levels allows the 3:1 compositing of individual tissue subs to be
done and still ensures that a 0.3ppb quantitation level be maintained in any individual sub.
(A 3-sub composite could have one sub containing 0.3ppb CAP blended (composited) with two subs
containing no chloramphenicol and the composite would still be confirmed for CAP). See table 1
for recovery data of chloramphenicol in shrimp and crab.

<h3>Safety</h3>
<ol>
<li>Standard laboratory safety practices (lab coats, eye protection) should be followed.</li>
<li>In addition any safety precautions listed in the determinative SOP for preparation of
reagents should be followed.</li>
<li>Also follow instrument manufacturer's guidelines for safe operation of electrospray LC/MS
(particularly with respect to high voltages, high current, and high temperatures).</li>
