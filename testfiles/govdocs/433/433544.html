			The development of two novel ‘conjugated’ polymers will be presented: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp 1) Cross-conjugated PPE-PPV hybrids, and, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp 2) Pi-stacked chromophores assembled on a DNA backbone.  <p>The grafting of conjugated side chains onto a conjugated backbone is an effective strategy for modulating the HOMO and LUMO of the parent polymer, in this case, PPE.  Through combined electrochemical, spectroscopic and computational studies the interactions between these superimposed pi-systems can be understood.  Assembling multiple fluorophore nucleosides along a DNA backbone encourages multiple modes of photophysical interaction.  Sequences of rationally designed oligomers as well as combinatorial libraries demonstrate the unique properties of these polyfluorophores. <BR>

			In the present talk we shall show that the elastic moduli of porous matter ? metals and ceramics ? depend not only on the porosity, but also on processing parameters, e.g., particle size and sintering temperature. We demonstrate that elastic moduli change in a similar manner to the sintering process, and are therefore interrelated. Hence, the shear sound velocity and the longitudinal sound velocity are interrelated too. Therefore, one can evaluate the elastic moduli of porous materials using a single sound velocity, e.g., the longitudinal sound velocity, VL. Normalizing the sound velocities and the elastic moduli by the pore-free solid bulk values, we put forward a general equation for all normalized elastic moduli, which for E*, the normalize Young's modulus, is:  , where ? is the slope of the normalized matter density versus VL and C(?) is a normalized specified function of the Poisson’s ratio, ?.<BR>

			<a name="055203Anne%200%2E735772034713"></a>The Life Aquatic of Proteins:Importance of Accurate Solvent Models in Computational Simulations of Peptides<BR>
		
		
			Understanding protein structure and dynamics is a central and important problem in structural biology. Small model peptides are useful for studying this problem as they reduce the complexity involved in studying the folding of larger proteins while providing important insights into the formation of protein secondary structure. The small size of model peptides makes them particularly amenable to study by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, which can provide atomic-level detail of peptide dynamics. When this data is used in conjunction with that from experiment it can be used to explain certain experimental results, or make predictions that can then be tested by experiment.Agreement with experimental results is an important benchmark for the validation of simulation results.
One major problem in comparing MD simulations with experiment is that of convergence ­ the timescales available to MD simulations are typically orders of magnitude shorter than experimental timescales. Enhanced sampling techniques such as
Replica Exchange Molecular Dynamics (REMD) can be used to improve convergence of simulations. Further improvements in sampling can be achieved through the use of implicit solvent models, which increase sampling by reducing solvent friction and
improving the sampling of solvent configurations. However, it is extremely important to gauge the accuracy of implicit solvent models due to their approximate nature.
The accuracy of several generalized Born (GB) implicit solvent models was studied via REMD simulations of a small polyalanine peptide. The GB solvent models were found to give incorrect secondary structure populations compared to simulations with explicit solvent and experimental results. This discrepancy in secondary structure was found to be related to incorrect estimation of the solvation free energy gap between conformations of the polyalanine peptide by these GB models. However, an implicit solvent model based on the Poisson Equation (PE) was found to give better results. Attempts to improve the accuracy of the GB models by fitting to PE were not successful, indicating there may be limitations to the improvement of current GB models.

				MATERIALS AND CONSTRUCTION DIVISION SEMINAR: 
			
		
		
			<a name="120517Aaron0%2E27963694638"></a>An Introduction to the Risk Mitigation Toolkit<BR>
		
		
			The Risk Mitigation Toolkit helps the owners and managers of constructed facilities—buildings, industrial facilities, and other critical infrastructure—to select cost-effective combinations of mitigation strategies that respond to natural and man-made hazards.  The Toolkit builds on a three-step protocol that NIST developed, which establishes a methodology for dealing with extreme events.  The three-step protocol helps decision makers assess the risk of their facility to damages from extreme events; identify engineering, management, and financial strategies for abating the risk of damages; and perform an economic evaluation to select the most cost-effective combination of risk mitigation strategies to protect their facility.  The Toolkit is a central source for identifying and retrieving risk assessment and risk management guidance documents, databases on the frequency and consequences of natural and man-made hazards, procedures for performing economic evaluations, and software tools needed to develop a cost-effective risk mitigation plan for constructed facilities.  The Toolkit is a web-enabled version of NISTIR 7390, an annotated bibliography of more than 300 cited references that covers key resource documents, databases, web portals, clearinghouses, and software tools.  The Toolkit has the added advantage of allowing you to click on and browse web sites associated with the cited references, many of which permit documents and data files to be downloaded for future reference and use.<BR>

			Please join us at this seminar to learn about National Instruments' strategies for data management, data mining and data storage. This seminar is intended for LabVIEW users as well as the users of Excel, DIAdem and other data post processing tools. 

The increasing trends in microprocessor speed and storage capacity have resulted in an explosion of data stored in files and databases. While on one hand technology is enabling faster and richer data retention, managing and making good use of this data is still a challenge. This seminar will address the technologies available from National Instruments to turn test and simulation data into usable information to increase efficiencies and spend less time searching for and managing test data. We will focus on efficient data storage technologies, data mining tools and data post-processing and reporting. <BR>

			<a name="021322Lione0%2E819655425237"></a>D33 - A third Small Angle Neutron Scattering instrument at ILL<BR>
		
		
			D33 will be a third Small-Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS) instrument at ILL, adding to and building upon the highly productive and world leading D11 and D22 instruments. Modern trends in materials science, physics and in particular nano-structured materials require that D33 should provide both high resolution and wide dynamic q-range. In ÔmonochromaticÕ mode a high-resolution velocity selector and flexible system of inter-collimation apertures will define the neutron beam. A double chopper system will enable a novel Ôtime-of-flight (TOF)Õ mode of operation (2? to 20?) allowing an enhanced dynamic q-range and flexible wavelength resolution. TOF on a reactor source has the distinct advantage that pulse frequency, bandwidth and resolution can be optimally matched to the neutron flight path without compromise. Two large multitube detectors will allow a wide dynamic q-range ~ 15 and (a massive) ~150 in monochromatic and TOF modes respectively. Beam polarisation and 3He spin analysis will facilitate and expand studies of magnetism and allow a more quantitative analysis of spin incoherent samples. Enhancements such as focussing lenses will be available to allow the study of large samples without loss of resolution while refractive prisms will improve resolution at long wavelengths by cancelling gravitational effects. The TOF chopper system will also allow time-resolved and kinetic studies (< 10Õs ms) using the ÔTISANEÕ technique. The siting of D33 will be such as to allow high magnetic fields at the sample position. Low background sample environments are foreseen where possible incorporating windowless mating of common vacuum spaces. As a SANS instrument with full polarisation and analysis we ultimately have the ambitious intention to implement new and novel spin manipulation, ÔbunchingÕ and interference techniques which allow much higher resolution in either time or space.<BR>

			<a name="113759Steve0%2E0803865411506"></a>Are We There Yet? Measuring When Robots Are Ready for Deployment<BR>
		
		
			Robots hold much promise as tools that will aid humans in a wide variety of 
missions and applications. They are being developed for military missions, transportation systems, factory automation, and homeland security, to mention a few examples. Yet there are scant means of objectively and quantifiably being able to determine whether robots are ready to be fielded or how effective they will be in accomplishing a particular mission. There currently are no measures available to compare alternative robotic solutions and select the most suitable one. To address this shortcoming, NIST is working with stakeholders to define application-specific requirements for robot performance, to devise test methods and metrics for evaluating the performance, and to generate consensus standards. This talk will present the challenges in developing a measurement science for robotics and provide examples of the process used in a methodology that abstracts application-specific real world challenges into quantifiable and reproducible tests.<BR>

			<a name="034925Eliza0%2E270050358416"></a>Metrication in Australia – What We Did Right<BR>
		
		
		Australian metrication specialist, Pat Naughtin, will speak about successful metrication strategies used in Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa across many trades, crafts, and professions.  Mr. Naughtin will describe which methods worked, while referring to the costs that Australians saved and are still saving every day through their successful metric transition.  Mr. Naughtin will also comment, as an outside observer, on the metrication programs of Canada, the UK, and the USA and explore the question:  How can people in the USA profit from Australia's metrication experience?  At this meeting, you will have an opportunity to ask your own questions about metrication and the metric system from a recognized international specialist.<BR>

			<b>2007 U.S. WORLD STANDARDS DAY PAPER COMPETITION</b><BR>
		
	
	
		The U.S. standards community will celebrate World Standards Day on Thursday, October 18, 2007, at the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center in Washington, DC.    This year’s theme, “Standards and the Global Village” recognizes the global consensus-building capacity of standards developing organizations.  Along with this event, the 2007 World Standards Day Sponsors, including NIST, will hold the annual paper competition.  Papers are invited that show, using specific examples, ways that standards developing organizations have encouraged and created global consensus for the economic and social benefit of the global village. Paper competition winners will be announced and given their awards at the U.S. celebration of World Standards Day. Cash prizes are awarded by the Standards Engineering Society (SES) and the World Standards Day Planning Committee. The first place winner will receive a plaque and $2,500. Second and third place winners will receive $1,000 and $500, respectively, along with a certificate. In addition, the winning papers will be published in SES’s journal, Standards Engineering.  ELIGIBILITY: The competition is open to all U.S. individuals in the private sector or at government facilities. Papers may be co-authored. RULES: Entries must be original and not previously published. NIST papers must be processed through WERB or BERB. All paper contest submissions must be received with an official entry form by midnight August 31, 2007, by the SES Executive Director, 13340 SW 96th Avenue, Miami, Florida, 33176.  Complete details and entry forms are available on the SES website www.ses-standards.org  (follow the link for “2007 WSD Paper Competition.”)  For additional information about the U.S. Celebration of World Standards Day, or to register for the event, please visit www.wsd-us.org.<BR>
