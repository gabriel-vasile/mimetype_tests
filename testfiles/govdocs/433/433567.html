<H2>2.2 &nbsp; ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING</H2>
<P>
Kirtland Federal Complex is located on a high, arid 
mesa about five miles east of the Rio Grande in Bernalillo County, New 
Mexico. The mesa is cut by the east-west trending Tijeras Arroyo, which 
drains into the Rio Grande. The east side of the Kirtland Federal Complex 
north of Tijeras Arroyo is bounded by the southern end of the Sandia 
Mountains and south of Tijeras Arroyo by the Manzanita Mountains 
(foothills of the Manzano Mountains). Most of the area is relatively 
flat, sloping gently westward toward the Rio Grande. However, the eastern 
portion of the Complex extends into the canyons of the Manzanita 
Mountains. The western slope of the Manzanita Mountains facing the base 
is precipitous and rough and has numerous arroyos. Elevations range from 
4920 feet (ft) at the Rio Grande to 7988 ft at the Manzano Lookout Tower 
in the Manzano Mountains. The mean elevation of the Kirtland Federal 
Complex is 5348 ft.<P>
The Department facilities are surrounded by the 
Kirtland Federal Complex and include some co-use agreements on United 
States Air Force (USAF) property. An area of the Manzano Mountains in the 
eastern portion of the approximately 80 square-mile (sq mi) Kirtland 
Federal Complex has been withdrawn from the USFS for the exclusive use of 
the USAF and the Department.<P>
Located to the north and west of the 
Kirtland Federal Complex, Albuquerque is the largest population center in 
Bernalillo County. The 1990 census figure shows an Albuquerque population 
of 384,736. The greater Albuquerque area, including Rio Rancho and 
Corrales, has approximately 422,700 inhabitants. A 1994 projection of the 
Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) population, which includes Bernalillo 
County, Valencia County, and Sandoval County, is 645, 500. The Isleta 
Indian Reservation borders the Kirtland Federal Complex on the south. The 
Pueblo of Isleta, located approximately 8 mi southwest of the base, had a 
population of 1703 in 1990 and the wider reservation area had a total 
population of 2171 in 1990.<P>
Weather in the Albuquerque/Bernalillo 
County area is characterized by low precipitation; wide temperature 
extremes; frequent, drying winds; heavy rain showers, usually short in 
duration and often with erosive effects; and erratic, seasonal 
distribution of precipitation. Albuquerque air temperatures are 
characteristic of high-altitude, dry continental climates. The average 
annual precipitation is 8.2 inches (in.). Winter months are typically dry 
with less than two inches of precipitation normally recorded. Strong 
winds, often accompanied by blowing dust, occur mostly in late winter and 
early spring.<P>

<P>
The Kirtland Federal Complex is located in the eastern 
portion of the Albuquerque Basin, on a relatively flat mesa southeast of 
the city of Albuquerque. The Albuquerque Basin is one of a series of 
north-south aligned structural grabens (blocks of downthrown crust) that 
make up the Rio Grande Rift. The rift is over 600 miles long and runs 
from southern Colorado to western Texas and northern Mexico. The Rio 
Grande Rift was created by movement of the Colorado Plateau and the 
western portion of the North American Continent relative to the remainder 
of the North American continent. Weaknesses in the continental structure 
allowed the western side of the continent to break away and move faster 
than the eastern side. This breaking, or faulting, allowed for blocks of 
crust to drop relative to the surrounding land surface, forming grabens 
and creating the rift. Subsequent basin-filling by sedimentary action has 
resulted in the current geography, which includes the Rio Grande whose 
course is controlled by the surface expression of the rift. The generally 
recognized boundaries of the Albuquerque Basin (Figure 2.2-1) include the 
Sandia and Manzano uplifts to the east, the Nacimiento uplift to the 
north, the Puerco fault zone to the west, and the Socorro basin to the 
south. The Albuquerque Basin is approximately 100 miles from north to 
south and 50 miles from west to east.<P>
<p>
<B><I>Sedimentology</B></I>
<P>
Soils in the Albuquerque Basin range from fine-grained clays and 
silts near the river channel to well-drained sands and sandy loams on the 
mesas and highlands. Figure 2.2-2 lists and locates the soil types mapped 
within the Kirtland Federal Complex.<P>
<P>
The Santa Fe Group makes up the predominant surface exposures and consists 
mainly of fan shaped deposits eroded from the Sandia, Manzano, and Manzanita 
mountains. These fan-shaped deposits are composed of coarse, poorly to 
moderately sorted sediments ranging in size from clay to boulders, and 
variable thickness from inches to several feet. Individual units pinch out 
laterally or are truncated by erosional forces, creating limited continuity 
in map view. Flooding events may deposit very thin, fine-grained layers over 
a wide area.<P>
<P>
<B><I>Seismicity (Earthquake Activity)</B></I>
<P>
Seismic activity (earthquakes) in the Albuquerque area are infrequent 
and usually of low intensity. In the Albuquerque area, the largest 
reported event of this century occurred on January 4, 1971, and 
registered 4.7 on the Richter scale. Property damage caused by this 
earthquake was limited to cracked plaster and a few broken windows.<P>
<P>
Albuquerque and the Kirtland Federal Complex lie within Seismic Risk Zone 
2, as defined by the International Conference of Building Officials 
(ICBO) <I>Uniform Building Code</I>. Seismic Risk Zone 2 is a 
classification of moderate potential for damage to structures from 
seismic activity. All Department facilities are designed and constructed 
in compliance with building codes current during the design process.<P>
<P>
<B><I>General Hydrogeologic Description</B></I>
<P>
The Albuquerque Basin is the third largest of the structural basins of the 
Rio Grande Rift and is home to the largest population center along the 
rift. The city of Albuquerque and its surrounding area populations rely 
solely on groundwater as their potable and industrial water source. The 
relationship between the geology of the basin and the hydrogeologic 
parameters of the water source moving through it will be critical in the 
future development of the area. <P>
<P>
<B><I>Hydrogeologic Structure</B></I>
<P>
The primary sedimentary units in the Albuquerque Basin are associated with 
the Santa Fe Group. This formation consists of alluvial material (outwash 
deposits from the surrounding highlands) and fluvial materials (river 
sediments) that have been reworked by erosional forces (wind and water). 
Volcanism in the area occurs as basaltic lava flows and layers of ash that 
have been deposited directly or transported into the rift area.<P>
<P>
Layered sediments create zones of variable porosity and permeability in a 
vertical direction that may act to impede groundwater flow. For example, a 
lava flow (low porosity and permeability) underlying a series of sandy or 
gravelly deposits (high porosity and permeability) would serve as a barrier 
to downward migration of groundwater. In the Albuquerque area, the variety 
of sediment types and depositional processes has resulted in a very 
complex "layer cake" of sedimentary units. The variable nature of the 
sediments and the processes that deposited them makes it difficult for 
geologists to predict specific conditions beneath the surface.<P>
<P>
Superimposed upon this complex layered sedimentary structure are the rift 
zone faults present throughout the area. These faults generally follow 
the eastern and western edges of the rift, and are generally oriented 
north to south. Three major faults traverse the Kirtland Federal Complex, 
and converge near Tijeras Arroyo beneath the Complex (Figure 2.2-1). The 
Hubbell Spring Fault runs southward from Kirtland Federal Complex to 
approximately the Socorro county line. This fault delineates the western 
edge of the Hubbell Bench, which lies at the foot of the Manzano 
Mountains. The second major fault is the Sandia Fault, which runs 
northward from Kirtland to an indeterminate point in Sandoval County. The 
Sandia Fault may be an extension of the Hubbell Spring Fault. This fault 
delineates the foot of the Sandia Uplift and is a high-angle normal 
fault, down to the west. The third major fault in the area is the Tijeras 
Fault, which is a scissors-type fault (down to the southeast) that runs 
from Kirtland to the northeast, and is believed to be the structural 
boundary between the Sandia and Manzano mountains.<P>
<P>
<B><I>Groundwater Depth and Flow Direction</B></I>
<P>
The presence of the faults described in the previous section has a direct 
bearing on the movement and occurrence of groundwater in the vicinity of the 
Kirtland Federal Complex. Complicating the issue of groundwater depth and 
movement are changes to the steady-state condition induced by pumping of 
groundwater from city, private, and industrial wells. In general, 
groundwater is located at a greater relative depth near the foothills 
(except near recharge areas at the mouths of canyons), and groundwater 
depth becomes relatively shallower near the river in the inner valley. 
Flow direction is consistently downbasin (south), with local variations 
due to groundwater pumping (i.e. westward flow near KAFB), geologic 
structure, or shallow influences near the river.<P>
<P>
Early studies of groundwater flow showed movement to be toward the southwest. 
Pumping of water wells has locally shifted flow direction from a southwesterly 
to a northwesterly direction, toward the city wellfields (Figure 2.2-3).<P>
<P>
<B><I>Ecology</B></I>
<P>
Four major North American physiographic and biotic provinces meet in the area 
of the Kirtland Federal Complex: the Great Basin, the Chihuahuan Desert, the 
Rocky Mountains, and the Great Plains. The characteristics of the Great Basin 
are the most predominant of the four, but biotic communities of the other 
three provinces also exist within the Kirtland Federal Complex.<P>
<p>
Four vegetation formations are found in these communities: grassland, 
woodland, riparian scrubland, and riparian woodland. Riparian woodland 
and riparian scrubland are limited to arroyos and canyons. Grasslands and 
woodlands dominate the rest of the area <a href="SDAfig224.html">(Figure 
2.2-4</a>). <P>
<p>
Wildlife communities within the Kirtland Federal Complex generally include 
amphibians, reptiles, birds (breeding and migratory), and mammals. Their 
diversity and abundance vary at given locations depending on the quantity 
and quality of habitat. When considering the habitat of a given species, 
food, water, and shelter are as important as corridors of travel between 
habitat areas, the potential for human intrusion, and the availability of 
breeding sites. In general, wildlife communities living within the 
boundaries of the Kirtland Federal Complex are typical of those found in 
similar woodland and grassland habitats in central New Mexico. <P>
<P>
Biological surveys have been conducted in areas that contain SNL ER 
Project sites. The major vegetation type associated with these areas is 
comprised of woody shrubs, cacti, and grasses. Some areas also have 
vegetation such as Russian thistle, canaigre, globemallow, broom 
snakeweed and rabbitbrush, which are types of vegetation usually 
associated with highly disturbed areas. Although no species of special 
concern were observed in the immediate vicinity of these ER sites, 
several species of special concern were observed in the grassland habitat 
surrounding the sites. <P>
<P>
More detailed information about the ecology of Kirtland Federal Complex and 
Department ER sites can be found in the individual Management Area/Sector 
Workbooks that have been prepared for the CAB.<P>
