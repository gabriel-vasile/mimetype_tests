          Williamson  County  Hospital  is  just  outside  Franklin,  a
          rural community of  10,000  on  the  L&N  railroad  17  miles
          south of Nashville. Last year the 100-bed hospital ad-
          mitted  4128  patients  from  its  medical  service  area  of
          30,000 people.  About  one  of  every  15  admissions  was  a
          cardiac patient, 22  of  whom  died.  Physicians  and  nurses
          at Williamson are working to  lower  that  figure  through  a
          cooperative   RMP   arrangement   with   Vanderbilt   Medical
          School's coronary care center.

          The  project,  under  the  direction  of  Dr.  Noel  Hunt  of
          Vanderbilt and  Dr.  Robert  Hollister  of  Franklin,  is  an
          effort to find out if a  small  community  hospital  can  and
          should  maintain  a  coronary  care  unit.   Williamson   has
          set up  a  2-bed  unit  and  designed  a  33-hour  course  to
          prepare its staff for handling the coronary patient. It  also
          sent  nurse  Martha  Miller  through  the  rigorous  coronary
          nursing program at Baptist Hospital in Nashville.

                                 "We invited  representatives  from  the  schools  in  Washington
                              and  Oregon  and  chose  Paul  Ward  to   represent   the   several
                              California  institutions.  For  representation  on   our   southern

                              Mexico. Since  our  physicians  have  always  had  strong  ties  to
                              the  Universities  of  Utah  and   Colorado,   we   added   members
                              from both medical schools. Then  we  went  a  little  farther  away
                              and took  in  representatives  from  the  medical  college  at  the
                              University  of  Minnesota,  the  medical  schools  in   North   and
                              South Dakota, and from Creighton University in Omaha."
                                 Once  medical  school  representation  was   settled,   Mountain
                              States asked for recommendations  from  each  of  its  four  states
                              to  round  out  advisory  council   membership.   Seventeen   addi-
                              tional  people  were  added,   including   three   Indian   members
                              who speak for the major minority group  in  the  region.  With  its
                              ,advisory  group  selected,  the  program  was  ready  to  turn  to
                              other matters.
                                 Looking back,  Popma  recalls  that  no  one  in  the  sprawling
                              region  had  accurate  information  on  what   medical   facilities
                              were available or  what  the  training  and  educational  needs  of
                              health  professionals  were.  "We  recognized  that   we   had   to
                              assess  these  needs,"  he  says,  "and  we  decided  to  ask   the
                              people at the grass-roots level to tell us what they had  to  have.
                              With this  information,  we  could  then  attempt  to  design  ade-
                              quate programs."
                                 After  examining  several  alternatives,  RMP  and  WICHE  staff
                              members  decided  that  the  best  approach  was  a  field   survey
                              using  direct  mail  questionnaires.  "There   was   one   problem,

     to extend it to other parts of the  region.
       "We  already  knew   of   another   inha-
     lation  therapy   training   program   just
     25  miles  from  our  regional  office   at
     Caldwell    Memorial    Hospital,    Idaho.
     It  was  being  run  by  Charles  Reed,   a
     31-year-old internist, as  part  of.a  two-
     year  program  at  nearby   Treasure   Val-
     ley junior College."
       Gerdes   asked    Reed    and    Browning
     if  they  would  be   willing   to   expand
     their  programs  to  include   shorter-term
     training  for  personnel  of  hospitals  in
     the  region.  Both  were   receptive,   and
     they  sat  down  together'  to   design   a
     curriculum  and  draft  a  grant   proposal
     to   set   up   complementary    inhalation
     therapy  training  institutes  at  Caldwell
     and  at  the   Southern   Nevada   Memorial
     Hospital,  Las  Vegas.   The   request   is
     pending before DRMP.
       "The  exciting  thing  about  this   pro-
     gram,"  says  Gerdes,  "is  that  two  com-
     munity    physicians,    in     communities
     1000  miles  apart,  are  working  in  con-
     cert  on  a  common  project  with  a  real
     regional  emphasis   and   outlook.   Even-
     tually,  if  we  can  interest  other  phy-
     sicians  like  Drs.   Reed   and   Browning
     in  becoming  instructors,   we   hope   to
     make  this  curriculum  available  to  hos-
     pitals throughout the four states.
       Gerdes  points  out  that   up   to   now
     Dr.  Reed's  program  has  been  aimed   at
     students going  for  a  junior  college  AA

     ing  the  training  available  to  hospital
     personnel or  others  who  have  the  apti-
     tude  to  become  inhalation   technicians.
       Says  Gerdes:  "Typical  enrollees   will
     come  from   small   community   hospitals.
     They may  be  RNs,  but  we  hope  also  to
     attract  students  who,  while  they   have
     no  special  medical  training,   do   have
     the aptitude to  learn  the  material.  Our

               And  since  we  were  highly  geared  toward  field   research   and
               obtaining  information,.  we  had  to  find   people   who   thought
               along these lines."
                 Eventually the offices did -get  set  up  and  staffed,  at  which
               point  Mountain  States  was  ready   to   sit   down   with   SDC's
               Health   and   Environmental   Systems   Department    to    develop
               the series of questionnaires that  eventually  would  go  to  nearly
               all health personnel in the four states.
                 "Our  survey  universe  included  physicians,   dentists,   regis-
               tered nurses, licensed practical  nurses,  hospital  administrators,
               X-ray  and  lab  technologists,  physical  therapists....  I   think
               there were  eight  categories  we  wanted  to  reach,"  Popma  says.
               Deciding  just  how  to  reach  these  groups  required   that   the
               Boise staff  meet  regularly  with  state  offices  and  representa-
               tives  from  SDC  to  work  out  questionnaire  logic  and  wording.
                 "It took a lot of time and a lot of  wheel  spinning  to  come  up
               with  the  proper  questions,"   Popma   recalls.   "Some   of   our
               people  had  never  done  this,  and  you  can  imagine  that  there
               were  problems.  Often  there  was  quibbling  or  quarreling   over
               the correctness of a single word."
                When  the  rough  spots  were  ironed  out  to   the   point   that
               everyone could  live  with  the  results,  the  questionnaires  were
               printed  and  mailed  to  100  percent  of  all   health   personnel
               except  RNs  and  licensed  practical  nurses.   These   populations
               were  large  enough  to   require   use   of   a   random   sampling
               procedure.
                "Across the region  we  had  better  than  a  50  percent  return,"
               Popma  says   with   satisfaction.   "The   data   were   keypunched
               and  put  on  the  SDC  computer  in  Santa  Monica.  So   far,   we
               have run two analyses on this file,  and  the  results  have  helped
               us in devising certain operational activities.  After  all,  provid-
               ing  data  for  operational  programs  was  the  purpose  and  func-
               tion of the questionnaires."
                At  the  same  time  the  health   professional   survey   was   in

               on health facilities in the region.  To  get  an  accurate  line  on
               such  things  as  the  number  of  hospital  beds,  the  number  and
               location of  nursing  homes,  and  the  adequacy  of  transportation
               services, the staff designed what it now calls its Health  Profiles.

               enable us to tell what the health  facilities  needs  are  in  indi-
               vidual  communities.  I  should  mention  that  SDC  didn't   assist
               on this  effort.  We  devised  it  almost  completely  on  our  own.
               Naturally  there  were  times  when  SDC  looked  at  what  we  were
               doing and made suggestions, but  the  work  was  almost  all  ours."
