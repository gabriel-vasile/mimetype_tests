	<h3>Why is release detection crucial?</h3>
<p>All regulated tanks and piping must have release
detection so that leaks are discovered quickly before contamination
spreads from the UST site. You must provide your UST
system with release detection (often also called leak detection)
that allows you to meet three basic requirements:</p>

<ol>
<li>You can detect a leak from any portion of the tank or its
piping that routinely contains petroleum;</li>

<li>Your leak detection is installed, calibrated, operated, and
maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions;
and</li>

<li>Your leak detection meets the performance requirements
described in the federal regulations (<a href="../fedlaws/cfr.htm">sections 280.43 and 280.44</a>).</li>
</ol>

The leak detection requirements are summarized in the table below:

<strong>Special note for tanks 2,000 gallons or less in capacity:</strong> Tanks 2,000 gallons and smaller may be able to
use <a href="manltank.htm">manual tank gauging</a> to meet leak
detection requirements (be sure you read the link carefully to make
sure you meet all the requirements of this method).

<h3>What leak detection methods can you use to detect leaks from tanks?</h3>
Owners and operators of petroleum USTs must use at least one of the
leak detection methods below, or other methods approved by their
state agency.
<ol>
  <li><a name="contain" id="contain"></a><strong>Secondary containment and interstitial monitoring</strong><br />
  This involves placing a barrier between the UST and the environment.
The barrier provides secondary containment and can be a vault, liner,
or the outer wall of a double-walled structure.&nbsp; Interstitial monitoring
methods range from a simple dip stick to automated vapor or liquid sensors
permanently installed in the system. All USTs holding hazardous substances
that were installed after December 22, 1988 must use this method. <a href="intersti.htm">More detailed information on secondary containment and interstitial monitoring.</a>
<p>&nbsp;</p></li>

<li><a name="atg" id="atg"></a><strong>Automatic tank gauging (ATG) systems</strong><br />
ATGs use monitors permanently installed in the tank. These monitors
are linked electronically to a nearby control device to provide information
on product level and temperature. The gauging system can automatically
calculate the changes in product volume that can indicate a leaking tank.
This method does not work on piping. <a href="atg.htm">More detailed information on automatic tank gauging systems.</a><p>&nbsp;</p></li>

<li><a name="vapormon" id="vapormon"></a><strong>Vapor monitoring</strong><br />
Vapor monitors sense and measure product vapor in the soil around the
tank and piping to determine the presence of a leak. This method requires
installation of carefully placed monitoring wells. Vapor monitoring can
be performed periodically using manual devices or continuously using permanently
installed equipment. <a href="vapormon.htm">More detailed information on vapor monitoring.</a><p>&nbsp;</p></li>

<li><a name="liquidmo" id="liquidmo"></a><strong>Groundwater monitoring</strong><br />
Groundwater monitoring devices sense the presence of liquid product
floating on the groundwater. This method requires installation of monitoring
wells at strategic locations in the ground near the tank and along the
piping runs. To discover if leaked product has reached groundwater, these
wells can be checked periodically by hand or continuously with permanently
installed equipment. This method is effective only at sites where groundwater
is within 20 feet of the surface. <a href="liquidmo.htm">More detailed information on groundwater monitoring.</a><p>&nbsp;</p></li>

<li><a name="sir" id="sir"></a><strong>Statistical inventory reconciliation (SIR)</strong><br />
SIR uses sophisticated computer software to determine whether a tank
system is leaking. The computer conducts a statistical analysis of inventory,
delivery, and dispensing data collected over a period of time and provided
by the operator to a vendor. <a href="sir.htm">More detailed information on statistical inventory control.</a><p>&nbsp;</p></li>

<li><a name="manltank" id="manltank"></a><strong>Manual tank gauging</strong><br />
Manual tank gauging can be used only on tanks 2,000 gallons or smaller.
This method does NOT work on tanks larger than 2,000 gallons or on piping.
This method requires taking the tank out of service for at least 36 hours
each week to take measurements of the tank's contents. Tanks 1,000 gallons
or less can use this method alone. Tanks from 1,001 to 2,000 gallons can
use this method only when it is combined with periodic tank tightness testing
and only for 10 years after installing a new UST or upgrading an UST with
corrosion protection. After 10 years, these USTs must use one of the leak
detection methods listed above in 1-5. <a href="manltank.htm">More detailed information on manual tank gauging.</a>

<p>The additional method below can be used temporarily at petroleum UST sites: </p>
</li>

<li><a name="inventor" id="inventor"></a><strong>Tank tightness testing and inventory control</strong><br />
This is a combination of two methods. Tank tightness testing requires
periodic tests conducted by vendors who temporarily install special equipment
that tests the soundness of the tank. Tank tightness testing must be used
in combination with inventory control. Inventory control requires taking daily accurate measurements
of the tank's contents and performing monthly calculations to prove that
the system is not leaking. Tank tightness testing and inventory control
can be used only for 10 years after installing a new UST or upgrading an
UST with corrosion protection. After 10 years, these USTs must use one
of the leak detection methods listed above in 1-5. <a href="inventor.htm">More detailed information on tank tightness testing combined with monthly inventory control.</a></li>
</ol>

<h3>What leak detection methods can you use to detect leaks from piping?</h3>
Pressurized piping must meet the following
requirements:

<ul>
<li>The piping must have <a href="leakpipe.htm#pressurized">devices
that automatically shut off or restrict flow or have an alarm that
indicates a leak.</a></li>

<li>You must either conduct an <a href="leakpipe.htm#linetight">annual tightness test of the piping</a> or
use one of the following monthly methods:
<ul>
<li><a href="#contain">interstitial monitoring</a>,</li>
<li><a href="#vapormon">vapor monitoring</a>,</li>
<li><a href="#liquidmo">groundwater monitoring</a>,</li>
<li><a href="#sir">statistical inventory reconciliation</a>,</li>
<li>or other methods approved by the <a href="../faqs/call1st.htm">Implementing Agency</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

If your UST has suction piping, your leak
detection requirements will depend on which type of suction piping
you have.
<ul>
<li>If you determine that your suction piping has characteristics listed below, your piping may not need leak detection.
  <ul>
    <li>Below-grade piping operating at less than atmospheric pressure
      is sloped so that the piping's contents will drain back into the
      storage tank if the suction is released.</li>
    <li>Only one check valve is included in each suction line and is
      located directly below the suction pump.;</li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li>Suction piping that does not exactly match the characteristics
noted above must have leak detection, either monthly monitoring
(using one of the monthly methods noted above for use on
pressurized piping) or <a href="leakpipe.htm#linetight">tightness
testing of the piping every 3 years.</a> More information on
<a href="leakpipe.htm">leak detection for underground piping</a> is
available.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why might you fail to be in compliance even if you have the required leak detection equipment or method?</h3>
<p>It takes more than equipment to be in compliance and to have a
safe facility. You must operate and maintain this equipment
properly over time or you will not benefit from having the
equipment or using an approved leak detection method. Most
importantly, you must be sure you successfully use the method
at least once a month to determine if the UST system has
released any of its contents.</p>

<p>Failure to operate and maintain equipment and methods can lead
to new releases. For example, a poorly functioning ATG system will
provide inaccurate data that will be useless in detecting leaks. A
manual vapor or groundwater monitoring device that doesn't work
properly means you have no reliable leak detection system.
Inaccurate data from poorly operated and maintained measuring
devices can make SIR methods unable to usefully detect leaks in a
timely manner. If your leak detection fails, you may incur fines or penalties for noncompliance, as well as
 an expensive cleanup at
your UST site.</p>

<p>Be sure you review and use the information sources on our <a href="tanko&amp;m.htm">Operating And
Maintaining UST Systems</a> Web
pages.</p>

<h3>Are reporting and recordkeeping necessary?</h3>
<p>If operation of the leak detection method indicates a possible
leak, UST owners and operators need to <a href="tankr&amp;r.htm">report the potential release</a> to the
regulatory authority. UST owners and operators must <a href="tankr&amp;r.htm">keep records</a> on leak detection performance
and upkeep. These include the previous year's monitoring results,
the most recent tightness test results, performance claims by the
leak detection device's manufacturer, and records of recent
maintenance and repair.</p>

<h3>How can publications on leak detection help you?</h3>
<a name="protocol" id="protocol" />To
assist owners and operators in conducting proper leak detection,
OUST has developed several publications that are available on our
Web site for viewing, downloading, printing, or ordering. These
publications clearly present leak detection requirements to UST
owners and operators:
