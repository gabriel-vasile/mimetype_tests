                        systems, when combined with other elements of an emergency

                        property damage, personal injuries, and loss of life from 
                        fire in the workplace. Their main function is to quickly 
                        identify a developing fire and alert building occupants 
                        and emergency response personnel before extensive damage 
                        occurs. Automatic fire detection systems do this by using 
                        electronic sensors to detect the smoke, heat, or flames 
                        from a fire and providing an early warning.</span> <br>

                                    an OSHA standard specifically states that 
                                    you must install a fire protection system, 
                                    then you are required to follow this standard. 
                                    <br> <br>
                                    For example, if you install an automatic fire 
                                    detection system to satisfy the alarm and 
                                    signaling requirement of the &quot;Fixed Extinguishing 
                                    Systems&quot; standard
                                  <a title="29 CFR 1910.160" href="/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&p_id=9814">29 CFR 1910.160</a>, 
                                    then you are also required to comply with 
                                    the &quot;Fire Detection Systems&quot; standard
                                  <a title="29 CFR 1910.164" href="/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&p_id=9818">29 CFR 1910.164</a>. 
                                    But if you install a system only for insurance 
                                    purposes and not to satisfy any OSHA regulation, 
                                    you do not need to comply with this standard. 
                                    However, employers not required to comply may 
                                    find that the standard offers guidance that 
                                    may permit them to more effectively protect 
                                    employees and property in the event of a fire.
