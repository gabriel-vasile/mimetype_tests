<H2><CENTER>The Value of Real-Time Lightning Detection</CENTER></H2>

<P><B>February 5, 1997<BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="../images/lightningthumb.jpg" HEIGHT="82" WIDTH="122" ALIGN="RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"></B><FONT SIZE="+2">F</FONT>uture space-based lightning
detection and reporting of lightning flashes in real-time will provide valuable
additional information to existing weather sensing systems. This capability
will give weather forecasters the ability to more readily evaluate threats
due to lightning, thunderstorm intensity and growth, as well as storm dissipation
throughout the United States.</P>

<P>These are the conclusions of research conducted by scientists from <A HREF="http://www.msfc.nasa.gov/">NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center</A>
and the <A HREF="http://wwwghcc.msfc.nasa.gov/">Global Hydrology and Climate
Center</A> in Huntsville, Alabama, in conjunction with researchers at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), NASA's Kennedy Space Center,
the National Weather Service (NWS) Office in Melbourne, Florida, and operational
meteorologists with the U.S. Air Force's (USAF) 45th Weather Squadron at
Cape Canaveral Air Station. The results will be presented today at the American
Meteorological Society Seventh Conference on Aviation, Range, and Aerospace
Meteorology in Long Beach, California.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+2">I</FONT>n the summer of 1996, scientists began a study
to determine how continuous, real-time lightning detection from space might
provide added knowledge to the weather forecaster in the identification
and warning of thunderstorm hazards.</P>

<P>&quot;Past studies have repeatedly indicated the strong correlation between
electrification and the dynamics of thunderstorms,&quot; said <A HREF="mailto:steve.goodman@msfc.nasa.gov">Dr.
Steven Goodman</A> of the NASA/Marshall Space Flight Center, and principal
investigator of the experiment. &quot;What we have done here is develop
these concepts into real-time algorithms.&quot; The scientists developed
an interactive display environment that promotes the use of total lightning
measurements, in addition to conventional radar data, as an indicator in
identifying severe storms and storm morphology.</P>

<P>The Melbourne (Florida) Weather Service Office was selected as a testbed
to conduct this study because of the unique availability of real-time lightning
and radar data. It serves as an experimental forecast office for the NWS,
and as an Applied Meteorology Unit for NASA, USAF, and NWS.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>he<FONT SIZE="+2"> </FONT>enhancements to lightning
detection and forecasting capabilities could also improve space launch weather
support at USAF/Cape Canaveral Air Station and NASA/Kennedy Space Center.
Natural triggered lightning hazards are a significant threat to space launch.
Approximately one-third of the launches are delayed or scrubbed due to adverse
weather. According to Mr. William Roeder, 45th Weather Squadron's Chief,
operations Support Flight, the launch weather teams would benefit from improved
lightning sensing and warning.</P>

<TD><FONT SIZE="+2">&quot;O</FONT>ur demonstration system is based on the Integrated
Terminal Weather System (ITWS) developed for the Federal Aviation Administration
by the MIT&nbsp;Lincoln Laboratory,&quot; Goodman said. The system displays
a suite of weather products in real-time. The products are derived from
data acquired from the Melbourne WSR-88D (NEXRAD) Doppler radar, from the
Lightning Detection and Ranging (LDAR) system developed and operated at
NASA/Kennedy Space Center, and the National Lightning Detection Network
(NLDN), which detects and locates only the ground discharges. The LDAR detects
and maps both the in-cloud lightning flashes and the discharges to the ground.</TD>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/otdthumb.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="145" HEIGHT="97" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"><FONT SIZE="+2">A</FONT>n additional element of the experiment
involves the use of space-based observations of both in-cloud and ground
discharges from NASA's <A HREF="http://wwwghcc.msfc.nasa.gov/lightning">Optical
Transient Detector</A> (OTD). The OTD&nbsp;data are available 12-24 hours
following collection for retrospective analysis and validation studies.
The OTD, launched in April 1995 as a scientific payload aboard the MicroLab-1
satellite, is in a low-earth orbit, and provides an early demonstration
of the technology to map lightning from space at storm-scale resolution
both day and night. The satellite is at an orbital altitude of approximately
750 km (about 470 miles), which provides a total field of view of 1300 x
1300 km (813 x 813 miles).</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>he results presented in the study demonstrate in
several ways the incremental value of observing the total lightning in-cloud
and the discharges to ground in diagnosing the structure and characteristics
of thunderstorms:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Dr. Ravi Raghavan, of the Universities Space Research Association and
  experiment co-investigator, says the high temporal resolution of the LDAR
  data provides a rapid update on the evolving storm cells that enables scientists
  to continually characterize the structure, morphology, and hazards of active
  storm cells.
  <LI>Based on responses obtained from forecasters, the total lightning measurements
  provided by the LDAR were extremely valuable for identifying the existence,
  intensity, growth, and dissipation of thunderstorms. This capability is
  very useful during the &quot;heat of battle&quot;, when numerous, potentially
  hazardous storms are simultaneously growing and decaying in the forecast
  warning area of responsibility.
  <P>It is noteworthy that the total lightning measurements were very useful
  in identifying storm dissipation from the view of inclusion or exclusion
  of thunder in aviation terminal forecasts (and eventually Transcribed Weather
  Broadcasts). &quot;This is especially critical in the modernized weather
  service as the temporal accuracy of forecasts is being improved,&quot;
  said Dave Sharp, Science and Operations Officer at the Melbourne Weather
  Office. There are cases where the cloud is electrically active even after
  the final discharge to ground occurs.
  <P>Total lightning information adds considerable confidence to the safety
  margin forecasters include in their aviation products.
  <LI>Total lightning measurements with high temporal resolution can also
  be used to specifically address the risk of injury from lightning strokes.
  It has been found that the LDAR flashes typically precede the initial cloud-to-ground
  discharges by about 4 minutes. Thus, it may be possible to use this lead
  time in issuing lightning watches/warnings, according to co-investigator
  Dr. Earle Williams of MIT.
  <P>In a related study conducted by the NWS office at Melbourne, LDAR system
  was used to assist forecasters of the lightning threat in the vicinity
  of the Olympic soccer tournaments, which were held in the Orlando, Florida
  area during the summer of 1996.

<P><FONT SIZE="+2">N</FONT>ASA is demonstrating that real-time lightning detection
from space during day and night with the resolution to resolve individual
thunderstorm cells is now possible. &quot;The most capable space sensor
developed for lightning detection is the OTD, but we don't yet have continuous
observations of the continental United States in real-time,&quot; said Goodman.
&quot;Therefore, we utilized the local ground-based lightning detection
capability to demonstrate the value-added by having real-time detection
throughout the thunderstorm life-cycle.&quot;</P>

<P>Forthcoming sensors such as the <A HREF="http://wwwghcc.msfc.nasa.gov/lightning">Lightning
Imaging Sensor</A> (LIS), scheduled for launch in late 1997 aboard NASA's
Tropical Rain Measuring Mission (TRMM-1) observatory, will continue to demonstrate
the additional diagnostic storm information provided by observing the lightning
produced by thunderstorms. In the future, however, lightning sensors will
be placed in geostationary orbit, perhaps on the next generation of operational
weather satellites. These sensors will provide lightning data that are available
both day and night, and at the forecaster's workstation within 30 seconds
of occurrence. From their position in geostationary orbit, these sensors
will be able to survey all of the United States and nearby oceans, rather
than just one limited geographic area. A constellation of lightning sensors
could someday provide global coverage of the major continents and oceans.</P>
