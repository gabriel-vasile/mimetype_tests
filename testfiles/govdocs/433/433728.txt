Comprehensive Communities Program: A Unique Way To
Reduce Crime and Enhance Public Safety 

The Comprehensive Communities Program (CCP) is a
nationwide crime prevention and crime control
initiative established by the Bureau of Justice
Assistance (BJA) in 1994. The CCP model stresses
crime reduction and enhancement of public safety as
vital elements to improving the quality of life in
our nation's cities. CCP uses a simple approach that

--Brings together people most affected by crime 
problems.

--Gives each stakeholder a meaningful role in solving
problems.

--Applies a deliberate planning and implementation
process.

CCP's two primary components--community policing and
community mobilization--bring together community
residents and police officers to develop solutions 
to local problems. Other components of the program
include community prosecution, drug courts, crime
prevention through environmental design, youth
involvement initiatives, and community corrections.

Program Goals

CCP provides a framework in which community
residents, government agencies, and private
organizations can work together to improve the
quality of life in a community. The goals of the
program are to

--Suppress violence and restore the sense of
community well-being needed to recapture the security
of neighborhoods.

--Focus on the problems and concerns of communities
and their neighborhoods by initiating comprehensive
planning and improving government-community
relationships.

--Develop a comprehensive, multiagency strategy
within each community to identify the causes of 
violence and to control and prevent violent and
drug-related crime.

--Use community policing and other efforts to 
encourage citizens to take an active role in problem
solving.

--Coordinate and concentrate existing federal, state,
local, and private agency resources in the program
communities to maximize their impact on crime
reduction.

Program Principles

The following are key principles that underlie CCP
goals:

--Partnership and collaboration.

--Shared problem identification and problem solving.

--Commitment to change how public safety works.

To date, 15 jurisdictions have participated in this
public safety initiative. Although the sites differ
in area, population, culture, politics, and
resources, they all adhere to CCP principles in
tailoring their program to meet their community's
needs.

Program designers in Hartford, Connecticut,
established Problem Solving Committees (PSCs) in each
of the city's 17 neighborhoods to reduce crime and
enhance the quality of life. Each PSC is composed of
leaders of neighborhood groups, congregations,
business associations, clubs, and local agencies.
Representatives from each PSC participate in the
citywide Community Planning and Mobilization
Committee, created to share information and promote
shared problem solving. The city's community court,
which was developed in 1998 and is the nation's
second such court, evolved from Hartford's PSC
efforts.

In Salt Lake City, Community Action Teams (CATs)
operate in the city's seven council districts. CATs
core groups of government agency representatives meet
weekly to address local crime and disorder problems.
The diversity of CAT membership and the range of
expertise and resources they bring has helped make
this problem-solving mechanism an ongoing city
function.

Critical Elements

In addition to its underlying principles, CCP is
characterized by certain critical elements:

--Strategic planning. Ongoing planning by all key
stakeholders is essential for any progress in
developing this public safety strategy.

--Management and operations. An individual or team
coordinator must be given authority to oversee this
multifaceted strategy throughout its development.

--Evaluation. A sound public safety strategy must
include an evaluation component to help determine
whether goals are being met and to improve or modify
the strategy if needed.

--Sustainment. The strategy must be viewed as a
long-term effort, requiring ongoing commitment and
support from stakeholders.

Boston initiated its CCP by engaging neighborhood
residents and police officers in a citywide strategic
planning process. The focus of this effort is to
reduce crime problems that interfere with residents'
quality of life. Two significant programs, replicated
in other cities, grew out of this joint planning
process--the Youth Service Providers Network, which
links at-risk youth and their families with social
services, and Operation Night-Light, which teams up
probation and parole officers with police officers to
monitor probationers and parolees. 

Officials in Phoenix, Arizona, focused on one
neighborhood, the Greater Coronado Historical
District. Here, community groups, residents, police,
and local agency representatives identified local
problems and developed solutions. These stakeholders
collaborated with the University of Arizona to
evaluate local conditions, measuring the fear of
crime perceptions of residents before and after CCP
activities. The evaluation guided efforts to modify
the jurisdiction's crime prevention strategy.

A Positive Approach With Positive Results

By using the CCP approach, 15 jurisdictions across
the country have made great strides in reducing
crime, improving the quality of life, and improving
the delivery of services in their neighborhoods. They
have mobilized community members, police, social
service agencies, faith communities, city
departments, and a host of other partners to prevent,
intervene in, and control crime. Each collaborative
was designed for a specific area, showing the
flexibility and uniqueness of the CCP approach.

Baltimore, Denver, Fort Worth, Hartford, Salt Lake
City, and Wichita have witnessed up to 50-percent
reductions in violent crime in their CCP
neighborhoods. Atlanta, Columbia, the District of
Columbia, Oakland, and Seattle have also made
measurable progress. The following are some success
stories:

--Phoenix closed more than 70 drug houses.

--Omaha drastically reduced its juvenile truancy 
problem.

--Wilmington initiated a model juvenile drug court.

--Boston had only one gun-related juvenile death in a
4-year period.
