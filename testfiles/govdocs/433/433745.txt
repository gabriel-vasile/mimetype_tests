1.   Introduction

This  document  gives details of all fast control, timing,  event
data & resynchronization links used in the SVX II Upgrade readout
electronics project.  The intention of this document  is  not  to
include all implementation details for each link but to provide a
single  document containing information for each link  such  that
proper    integrated   systems   engineering   is   more   easily
accomplished.  For example, this document can be used as a  guide
for  studying how the system is initialized, readout is  aborted,
event  data  links  are resynchronized, link  errors  and  system
recovery techniques, etc.


2.   Fast  Controls  (Trigger System Interface) & Timing  (Master
     Clock) Links
  
  2.1. Fast Controls (Trigger System Interface) Link

The  Ôfast  controlsÕ link between the Trigger  System  Interface
(TSI)  and  the  SRC module consists of one 175 MHz  fiber  optic
ÔTaxiÕ   command  link  from  the  TSI  to  the  Silicon  Readout
Controller (SRC) and three copper coax control signals  from  the
SRC to the TSI.

For  a  more complete definition of these command link words  and
control  signals and an explanation of their use in  a  front-end
readout  system such as SVX, refer to the February 8,  1995  Yale
Trigger  Note  #1  ÒConceptual  Design  of  the  Trigger   System
Interface  for  the Run II UpgradeÓ and a subsequent  August  14,
1995  CDF  Group/Yale  University draft note ÒTrigger  Supervisor
Protocols for Run IIÓ.

     
     2.1.1.    Fiber Optic Serial Command Link To The Silicon Readout
          Controller (SRC)

There are four different types of control ÔwordsÕ sent by the TSI
to the SRC as given in the following four tables:

  Bit    Definition
   0     C0 (Always 0 for Level 1
         word)
   1     C1 (Always 0 for Level 1
         word)
   2     L1A (1 for Level 1 Accept)
   3     L1RO (1 for Level 1 Reject)
   4     L1B0 (Buffer address for
         L1A, LSB)
   5     L1B1 (Buffer address for
         L1A, MSB)
   6     RSRV1 (Reserved)
 7, 8    Spare
                             Table 1
                          Level 1 Word
                                
Level 1 Accepts (L1A) are passed on by the SRC to all on-detector
FIB crates whereas Level 1 Rejects are not used by the SVX
readout electronics.  L1B0 & L1B1 along with gated RSRV1 are
passed through SVX Fanout Modules to all VME Readout Buffer (VRB)
modules as the three least significant bits of Store Buffer ID
(see Table 7).

Question 1:     What  does  D0 need passed to VRB  modules  as  a
          result of L1As or L1Rs?

If  the  SRC received two or more Level 1 Accepts in a row (e.g.,
two  consecutive bunch crossings result in Level 1 Accepts),  the
SRC  always  immediately forwards the L1A to the FIB  crates  but
does  not send the ÒRead pipeline/digitize/readoutÓ command  (see
Table 10) for the second L1A and subsequent L1As until data  from
the previous L1A has been sent to VRB modules (SVX_DONE signal in
the SRC returned to logic Ô1Õ {see Section 2.3.2}).

Question 2:    Can D0 operate in an identical manner?
Question 3:     Assuming  the SRC keeps statistics  of  available
          buffers in the VRB modules, what should the SRC  do  if
          it  is  told by the TSI of a L1A and given a Ônot-freeÕ
          buffer  to  use  for that L1AÕs event  data  fragments?
          Should  ERROR  be  sent to the TSI and  this  condition
          logges  by  the  SRC for later VME monitoring  readout?
          Should  WAIT  be sent to the TSI (for how long?)  until
          the  buffer becomes free?  How does D0 (or calorimetry,
          etc.) want to handle this situation?

  Bit    Definition
   0     C0 (Always 0 for SES word)
   1     C1 (Always 1 for SES word)
   2     SESB0  (Buffer  Address   for
         SES, LSB)
   3     SESB1  (Buffer  Address   for
         SES, MSB)
   4     RSRV2 (Reserved)
   5     EVID0 (Bit 0 of DAQ Event ID,
         LSB)
   6     EVID1 (Bit 1 of DAQ Event ID,
         LSB)
   7     EVID2 (Bit 2 of DAQ Event ID,
         LSB)
   8     EVID3 (Bit 3 of DAQ Event ID,
         LSB)
                             Table 2
                      Start Event Scan Word

Why  did D0 want to send buffer ID through J3?  because their VBD
canÕt  do it over VME.  EVID passed through J3 backplane to  VRB.
Who checks this SVT, VRB  ... or FIB.

Abort  of Readout ... how?  Who decides there should be an abort?
How is this accomplished?  Maybe we need another line from SVT to
SRC  for  Abort.  FIB sends an artificial EOR after ABORT command
from SRC.  SVT does not send L2A.

   4       TEST     For testing TSI to SRC link as
                    follows:
                    Upon receipt of first TEST=1, SRC sets
                    DONE=0 and ERROR & WAIT=1.  Upon
                    receipt of the second TEST=1, SRC sets
                    DONE=1 and ERROR & WAIT=0.

                    list the SRC should use
                    For  the Scan List to change,  bits  2
                    through 5 must be zero.
                    The  Scan Lists currently defined  are
                    as follows:
                    000 Default
                    001 YMON
                    010 Plug Calorimeter

                          Control Word
                                
Bunch Zero is received from the Master Clock System less than or
equal to 21 microseconds after the SRC received Run from the
Trigger System Interface.  When Bunch Zero is received, the Level
1 pipeline in the SVX 3 ICs can start to be filled and be waiting
for Level 1 Accepts.

Question 4:     What  do  we  (CDF SVX) do with  all  these  bits
          especially  SCN0-SCN2?   For  example,  do   we   reset
          pipeline capacitor to zero when RESET is received?
Question 5:      When  the  TSI  goes  through  a  HALT-RESET-RUN
          sequence,  how do we operate?  There is talk  of  using
          DONE  or WAIT in another capacity during this sequence.
          When  RESET is received, DONE possible would be set  to
          logic zero until the SVX system is reset whereupon DONE
          would  be set to logic one.  Do we disable sending  any
          signals  (e.g.,  SYNCs)  to the  detector  during  this
          sequence?  How does D0 operate when resetting  and  are
          there any features needed in the VRB to accomodate  D0s
          ÔHALT-RESET-RUNÕ sequence?

Fast  controls link control signals returned by the  SRC  to  the
Trigger  System  Interface (TSI) consists  of  three  coax  cable
signals as given in the following table:

 Name    Definition
 DONE    Deasserted  at  receipt of Start  Event  Scan  word  &
         reasserted  when  internal (Level 2) buffer  is  again
         EMPTY
 ERROR   Asserted  if  a  Fatal Error is detected  in  the  SVX
         system
 WAIT    Asserted if a potential busy condition is detected  in
         the SVX system
                             Table 5
                   Control Signals To The TSI

Question 6:     Does  DONE only come from the SRC or is  there  a
          DONE from each VRB module?
Question 7:     Should  ERROR or WAIT be asserted when  Ôloss  of
          synchronizationÕ in either an event data  link  or  the
          SRC_Fanout is detected?
Note 1:   It    was   decided   that   ERROR   used.    Loss   of
          synchronization should be a rare error.
Question 8:     Should  there be one DONE line for the whole  SVX
          system?  Power on sets DONE.  VME command set and reset
          DONE.

  2.2. Master Clock Interface Link

The  Master  Clock System is designed to provide signals  of  any
frequency or wave shape based on the acceleratorÕs 53 MHz  clock.
The   frequency,   wave  shape  and  phase,   relative   to   the
acceleratorÕs  53  MHz clock, of each signal is controllable  via
VME.   Phase  adjustments are in one nanosecond increments.   The
signals are transmitted using differential PECL logic levels.

     
     2.2.1.    Signal Definitions & Levels

The  following four signals are transmitted by the  Master  Clock
System to the SRC module:

    Name     Definition
 SVX Clock   53   MHz   clock   signal  synchronized   to   the
             accelerator 53 MHz clock
    SYNC     Signal  synchronized  to the  accelerator  53  MHz
             clock,  one SVX Clock period in duration, centered
             at  the  low  to  high transition  of  SVX  Clock,
             occuring   once   every   132   nanoseconds    and
             indicating  the  possible presense  of  a  proton-
             antiproton bunch crossing
   Bunch     Signal  synchronized  to the  accelerator  53  MHz
  Crossing   clock,  one SVX Clock period in duration, centered
             at  the  low  to  high transition  of  SVX  Clock,
             occuring  whenever  there is  a  proton-antiproton
             bunch   crossing  (excluding  beam   gaps,   Bunch
             Crossings  occur  every  132  or  396  nanoseconds
             depending  upon the current accelerator  operation
             mode)
 Bunch Zero  Signal  synchronized  to the  accelerator  53  MHz
             clock,  one SVX Clock period in duration, centered
             at  the  low  to  high transition  of  SVX  Clock,
             occuring  once  every revolution of  beam  in  the
             accelerator main ring at ???? time
                             Table 6
                 Master Clock Signals To The SRC

Question 9:    Should ÔSVX ClockÕ be changed to ÔCDF ClockÕ?
Question 10:     What  is  the  CDF_CLK  described  in  the   CDF
          Synchronization proposal?
Question 11:    Is the SRC the only SVX device with a 8-bit Bunch
          Counter?   If  so, how is global checking accomplished?
          Also  since  all data has to be tagged with  the  Bunch
          Crossing number unless the SVT has a Bunch Counter, the
          FIBs have to send the Bunch Counter number to the SVT.
Question 12:    Should the FIB or the SVT and VRBs tag data  with
          the Bunch Crossing number?
Question 13:    Is  it  the  Bunch Crossing or the Beam  Crossing
          signal?
Note  2:   The Bunch Counter counting should not be gated by  the
Bunch Crossing signal.

Readout Buffer modules.

          2.4.1.1.  Signal Definitions & Levels

The  following  two  tables list signals,  signal  definitions  &
signal levels on the VRB Crate (Fast Control) J3 Backplane Link:

          Signals From SRC Module To SRC Fanout Module
               & VME Readout Buffer (VRB) Modules

Note 3:   Read  Buffer  ID (3:0) is only needed if  the  VME  bus
          cannot be used by the system to specify the buffer from
          which to read next event data fragments.
Question 14:    Is  Read buffer ID (3:0) required because of  the
          capabilities of the D0 readout controller?
Note 4:   Only  needed  if  VRB modules check  that  FIB  modules
          correctly append Bunch Counter to event data fragments.
          If  this  data integrity check is done, what  is  being
          checked at the VRB modules is the correct Bunch Counter
          data  transmission from the SRC to the FIB Crate Fanout
          modules,  from the Fanout modules to the  FIB  modules,
          FIB  appending of the Bunch Counter to their event data
          fragments,  and data transmission from the FIB  modules
          to the VRB modules.
Note 5:   Store  Buffer  ID, Read Buffer ID (if needed)  &  Bunch
          Counter  could  be  sent on shared  lines  via  encoded
          commands with a common strobe ... to reduce signal line
          count.

Note 6:   SYNC_ERR  RS-485 lines biased such that  SYNC_ERR  =  0
          when all VBR module SYNC_ERR RS-485 drivers are in tri-
          state  mode.  VRB module only puts its SYNC_ERR  RS-485
          driver in non tri-state mode when it drives SYCN_ERR  =
          1.   SYNC_ERR  remains asserted until  loss  of  G-link
          synchronization  is  no  longer  detected  by  the  VRB
          module.
Note 7:   BC_ERR  RS-485 lines biased such that BC_ERR =  0  when
          all  VBR  module BC_ERR RS-485 drivers are in tri-state
          mode.   VRB module only puts its SYNC_ERR RS-485 driver
          in  non tri-state mode when it drives BC_ERR = 1.  Only
          needed  if VRB modules check that FIB modules correctly
          append Bunch Counter to event data fragments.  See Note
          3 above.
Question 15:   How long is BC_ERR asserted and how is it reset?

******** 160-pin DIN for J3 connector ********

          
          2.4.1.3.  Backplane Signal DC Bias & Termination Networks

In  order  to ensure that backplane signals are both  at  a  pre-
defined  state when not driven and are not unduly susceptible  to
noise,  all  VRB Crate differential RS-485 backplane signals  are
terminated at one end with a DC bias network and at the other end
with a resistor termination as follows:

DC  Bias Network:

Each differential RS-485 pair has a DC bias network consisting of
a  120  ohm resistor connected at one end to +5 volts and at  its
other end to a 240 ohm resistor.  The opposite end of the 240 ohm
resistor is connected to ground through another 120 ohm resistor.
Each  differential  RS-485  pair  connects  across  the  240  ohm
resistor.  Receivers are connected such that logic 0 is  received
at  the output of receivers when the RS-485 pair is not driven by
a driver.  If the receivers contain internal bias circuitry, they
are  connected such that the DC bias network aids this  circuitry
to  produce a specific logic level at the output of the receivers
when  a  differential  RS-485 pair is not  driven.   Drivers  are
connected such that they are logically consistant with the above.

For  signals driven by the SRC Fanout module, the DC bias network
is  at  the  opposite end of the backplane from  the  SRC  Fanout
module.   For signals received by the SRC Fanout module,  the  DC
bias network is nearest the SRC Fanout module.

Termination Network:

The  termination network consists of a 120 ohm resistor connected
across each differential RS-485 pair.

For  signals  driven  by the SRC Fanout module,  the  termination
network is at the end nearest the SRC Fanout module.  For signals
received by the SRC Fanout module, the termination network is  at
the opposite end of the backplane from the SRC Fanout module.

  2.6. SRC To FIB Crate (Fast Control & Timing) Links

The SRC To FIB Crate Link transmits both Fast Control information
from the Trigger System Interface (and the SRC module) and Timing
information  from  the  Master Clock over a 1.06  Gigabits/second
fiber  optic link inmpemented with HP 2nd generation G-link  ICs.
Multiple  outputs  on the SRC module are used  to  transmit  fast
control  and timing information from the SRC module to  each  FIB
Crate  Fanout module.   The following sections gives  details  of
these links.
     
     2.6.1.    Signal Definitions

The  following  table lists all Fast Control signals  and  Timing
signals  transmitted from the SRC module to each FIB crates  over
the SRC To FIB Crate links:

#  Signal Name         Signal Definition
1  SVX Clock           (See Table 6)
2  SYNC                (See Table 6)

                             Table 9
         SRC To FIB Crate Fast Control & Timing Signals

Question 16:   Should the Bunch Crossing Number be included?  See
          Table 7 and Note 3.

Who checks for P Cap # integrity and how is error indicated?  SRC
          has  the  Bunch Crossing # and sends it to  FIBs  where
          FIBs  append it to data.  Bunch crossing COULD be  sent
          to  VRBs  but ...  Pipeline Cap # sent only  after  SRC
          sends digitize & readout after sending L1A.  After
Advance Pipeline ... SRC always sending SYNC pulses.  If 132  ns,
          acquisition  and  readout EVERY time  if  396  ns,  1/3
          times.

Question 17:    Does  Table 10 contain correct and  all  commands
          needed in production components?
Note 8:   Wherever  information  is from another  document/source
          (e.g.,  Table  10),  add  complete  reference  to  that
          document/source.

Note 9:   The  53  MHz  SVX  Clock is derived at each  FIB  Crate
          Fanout  module  from the receipt of each Control/Timing
          Word  and  its G-link receiver phase-locked-loop.   The
          signalÕs  duty cycle is 50% also because of the  phase-
          locked-loop.

Control  of  the phase of the 53 MHz SVX Clock and  SYCN  signals
relative  to  the master accelerator clock signal is accomplished
within   the  Master Clock System.  Phase of each signal  can  be
individually varied in one nanosecond increments.

SYNC  is  true  for  one  SVX Clock cycle  whenever  there  is  a
potential   p-pbar   collision.   Depending  upon   the   running
conditions of the accelerator, this signal will occur  in  bursts
each separated by either 132 or 396 nanoseconds.

Pipeline Capacitor Number is generated within the SRC module  and
is  sent  towards the detector as a global SVX system check  that
each  SVX 3 IC is using the same Ôpipeline capacitor numberÕ  and
that this number is the same as that generated by the SRC module.
Each SVX 3 IC containing one or more hits transmits its Ôpipeline
capacitor numberÕ used to attain the transmitted data.

Bunch Crossing Number ????

Advance Pipeline ????

Level  1  Trigger Accept is received by the SRC from the  Trigger
System  Interface whenever the Level 1 Trigger System detects  an
accepted Level 1 trigger.

Command  is a five-bit word sent by the Trigger System Interface.

             SRC To FIB Crate Control & Timing Words
                                
Question 18:    Table 11 gives only possible Control/Timing words
          and  their  bit maps.  Is this the flexibility  desired
          and/or required?  Is there a simpler implementation?
