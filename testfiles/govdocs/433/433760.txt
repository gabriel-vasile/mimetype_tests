Executive Summary
Introduction.  The Federal Communications Commission’s Laboratory Division 
has completed a second phase of its measurement studies of the spectrum sensing and 
transmitting capabilities of prototype “TV white space” devices.  These devices have 
been developed to demonstrate capabilities that might be used in unlicensed low power 
radio transmitting devices that would operate on frequencies in the broadcast television 
bands that are unused in each local area.  At this juncture, we believe that the burden of 
“proof of concept” has been met.  We are satisfied that spectrum sensing in combination 
with geo-location and database access techniques can be used to authorize equipment 
today under appropriate technical standards and that issues regarding future development 
and approval of any additional devices, including devices relying on sensing alone, can 
be addressed.
 
The Commission is conducting a rulemaking proceeding to consider authorization 
of new, low power transmitting devices in the television broadcast spectrum at locations 
where channels are not being used for TV or other authorized services (ET Docket No. 
04-186).  This locally unused spectrum is often referred to as “TV white space.” As 
established thus far by the Commission, white space devices (WSDs) that operate from a 
fixed location will be allowed into the TV spectrum simultaneous with the completion of 
the transition from analog to digital television broadcasting on February 17, 2009.  This 
action will open for use a significant amount of spectrum with very desirable propagation 
characteristics that has heretofore lain fallow.  It will also allow the development of new 
and innovative types of unlicensed devices that provide broadband data and other 
services for businesses and consumers without disrupting the incumbent television and 
other authorized services that operate in the TV bands.  The Commission is considering 
whether to also allow “personal/portable” WSDs to operate in the TV spectrum.
One of the principal considerations in the white space proceeding is how to 
reliably determine the availability of unused frequencies in local areas.  A number of 
parties participating in the proceeding have suggested an approach for identifying unused 
frequencies whereby a WSD would employ a “listen before talk” or “detect and avoid” 
strategy.  This approach would use “spectrum sensing” techniques that listen for the 
signals of TV stations, wireless microphones, and other incumbent services.  The 
Commission has requested comment on whether to require that the sensing capability of 
devices using this approach be able to detect signals as low as -116 dBm, or some 
alternative value.  A second technical consideration in this matter is the potential for 
WSDs to interfere with TV reception and wireless microphone operations.  To address 
these issues, the Commission announced that it would perform testing of the spectrum 
sensing and transmitting capabilities of the prototype WSDs.
The purpose of the testing program is to provide additional information for the 
record that will be considered along with other information in developing the 
Commission’s final decision on white space devices.  The tests are not intended for 
equipment authorization or to determine whether the devices would comply with any 
v
possible standards that the Commission might adopt.  Rather, they will provide 
information in support of the Commission’s action in this matter.  Initial tests (Phase I) 
under this program were completed in July of 2007.1  This report describes the tests 
performed during the second (Phase II) series of tests and provides a compilation of the 
results of measurements of the spectrum sensing and transmitting functions of various 
prototype WSDs.  
In October 2007, the Commission’s Office of Engineering and Technology (OET) 
issued a Public Notice announcing that it would perform additional laboratory and field 
tests of white space devices and invited interested parties to submit such devices for 
testing at the FCC Laboratory in Columbia, Maryland.2 Subsequently, OET issued a 
second Public Notice announcing that the second phase testing would begin on January 
24, 2008.3
WSD Prototype Devices Submitted for Evaluation.  Five devices were submitted 
for examination in the Phase II tests.  These devices were provided by Adaptrum, the 
Institute for Infocomm Research (I2R), Microsoft Corporation, Motorola Inc., and Philips 
Electronics North America (Philips). These devices are not intended as actual consumer 
products but rather are development tools for evaluating the viability of spectrum sensing 
and potential interference.  They do not communicate with other devices.  Not all tests 
were performed on all devices.  For example, the Microsoft device was available only for 
limited tests in the laboratory and the I2R device was submitted after the initial tests were 
completed.
Spectrum Sensing for TV Broadcast Signals.  This portion of the study examined 
the ability of the WSDs to detect whether channels are occupied by ATSC (digital) TV 
signals.   All of the prototype devices had capabilities for detecting TV broadcast signals 
on UHF channels 21-51, the operating range of the prototype devices.  The tests were 
initially performed in the laboratory under various controlled conditions.  Spectrum 
sensing sensitivity to clean digital TV signals in isolation and also in the presence of 
other TV signals on adjacent channels was measured.  In addition, sensitivity tests were 
performed using recorded TV signals to simulate “real world” conditions.  Spurious 
emissions generated by the prototype WSDs were also measured.  The laboratory tests 
were followed by field tests at nine sites in Maryland and the District of Columbia to 
evaluate the DTV sensing performance.
Spectrum Sensing for Wireless Microphones.  The wireless microphone portion of 
the testing looked at the ability of the WSDs to detect wireless microphones authorized

under Part 74 of FCC rules.  Microsoft, Philips and I2R indicated that their devices were 
capable of sensing wireless microphones.  Tests of this capability were initially 
performed in a controlled environment in the laboratory.  Those tests were followed by 
field tests at two sites, one in Maryland and one in New York City, to evaluate the 
capability of the devices to detect wireless microphones under field conditions.
Transmitter Characterization and Interference Testing.  The Adaptrum device 
included transmitting capability.4 Laboratory tests were performed to characterize the 
transmitter’s signal, which is an important element for assessing the interference potential 
of WSD devices.   Field tests were also performed to evaluate potential interference from 
the Adaptrum transmitter; however, these tests were limited.
Observations:
· All of the devices were able to reliably detect the presence a clean DTV signal on 
a single channel at low levels in the range of -116 dBm to -126 dBm; the detection 
ability of each device varied little relative to the channel on which the clean signal was 
applied.  These measurements did not take into account the antenna that would be used 
with personal/portable devices.
· The detection threshold sensitivity of the devices varied from -106 dBm to -128 
dBm when recorded off-air DTV signals, which included multi-path fading and other 
“real-world” distortion, were used. The impact on detection ability varied considerably 
among the WSDs and with the characteristics of the different recorded signals.  
· Several tests were performed with DTV signals present in adjacent channels.  
These tests showed that in the presence of moderate-to-strong signals in a first adjacent 
channel, the detection threshold sensitivity of all of the devices was severely impacted.  
For some of the devices, the degradation in the detection sensitivity was as much as 60-
70 dB.  In some cases, the degradation was such that the detection threshold could not 
be measured.  This could impact significantly the ability of the devices to reliably 
detect TV signals within stations’ service areas. 
· The Microsoft, Philips and I2R devices were tested for their ability to sense for 
the presence of wireless microphones (both FM/analog and digital) operating within 
UHF TV channels.  With no other signals present, the devices were able to detect 
wireless microphones at levels ranging from -103 dBm to -129 dBm depending on the 
type of microphone, and the device. In the presence of DTV signals in adjacent 
channels, the detection threshold was degraded such that it affected the ability of the 
devices to reliably detect the microphone signals.
  
4 The Microsoft device also had a transmitting capability but that device was withdrawn from the test 
program before the transmitter tests were conducted.
vii
· Scan time for the devices varied from 0.1 second per channel (Motorola) to 185 
seconds per channel (Adaptrum).  The Adaptrum device was modified during the tests 
and its scan time changed from 37 seconds per channel to 185 seconds per channel.
· Channel Occupancy (TV sensing) field tests were performed at nine locations for 
the Adaptrum, I2R, Motorola, and Philips devices.  
o In most cases, the devices correctly reported channels as occupied when the 
device was operated within the service contour of the stations broadcasting on 
those channels and viewable signals were observed on the channels.
o In some instances, the Adaptrum, I2R, and Motorola (in sensing only mode) 
devices incorrectly reported channels as unoccupied (available) when the 
WSD was operated within a station’s service contour and the signal was 
viewable.
o All of the devices reported some channels as occupied when the WSD was 
operated outside of the service contours of stations broadcasting on those 
channels whether the signal was viewable or not.
o The Philips device generally reported most channels occupied, whether the 
WSD was operating inside or outside any service contours whether the signal 
was viewable or not.
o During the field tests, the Motorola device’s geolocation/database feature was 
used in combination with its sensing capabilities. In those tests, the Motorola 
device correctly reported all occupied channels used by stations within whose 
contours the WSD was operated. 
· Wireless microphone sensing tests were performed using the I2R and Philips 
devices at two field locations. The tests were conducted first with microphones off, 
and then turned on, in pre-determined channels to determine if the devices could sense 
the presence of wireless microphones.  At both sites and all the test locations, the 
Philips device reported all the channels on which the microphones were designated to 
transmit as occupied whether the microphone was transmitting or not.  The I2R device 
indicated several channels as available even when the microphones were on.
· The Adaptrum device’s transmitter was characterized in the laboratory and was 
used to investigate interference potential to DTV signal reception.  Anecdotal tests 
demonstrated that co-channel interference would occur at line-of-sight distances of up 
to 360 meters at an EIRP of approximately +7 dBm when the DTV was receiving a 
weak signal using a receive antenna at a height of 9.3 meters.  No interference was 
observed when the Adaptrum device transmitted on an immediate adjacent channel 
even with the transmitter in close proximity to the receiver with a roof-top antenna.  No 
other configurations were tested for interference.
· Anecdotal tests were performed at two field sites to assess the interference 
potential from WSD transmitters to cable television reception via direct pick-up of 
signals by cable system components.  These tests showed that under certain 
viii
circumstances, when the transmit antenna was placed in close proximity to a cable 
connected TV, direct pick-up interference was observed.  The direct pick-up 
interference potential appears to be highly dependent on the interconnection among 
various system components (e.g., cable amplifiers, splitters and set-top boxes) being 
used.

1 Introduction
The Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) Laboratory Division has 
completed the second phase of its program to measure the spectrum sensing and 
transmitting capabilities of devices intended to operate on frequencies in the broadcast 
television bands that are unused in each local area.  These so-called “white space 
devices” (WSDs) have been developed to demonstrate features that might be used in 
unlicensed low power radio transmitting devices.  
This measurement project was undertaken in support of the Commission’s 
pending consideration in ET Docket No. 04-186 on whether to permit low power radio 
transmitting devices to operate on an unlicensed basis in the frequency bands that are 
currently allocated to the television broadcast and certain other licensed services.1 Such 
low power operations would only be allowed on frequencies that are not used by TV 
stations or other licensed services in each local area.  These unused, i.e., vacant or 
“available,” frequencies in local areas are often termed spectrum “white spaces.”  As 
established thus far by the Commission, fixed white space devices (WSDs) will be 
allowed into the TV spectrum simultaneous with the completion of the transition from 
analog to digital television broadcasting on February 17, 2009.  This action will open for 
use a significant amount of spectrum with very desirable propagation characteristics that 
has heretofore lain fallow and will allow the development of new and innovative types of 
unlicensed devices that provide broadband data and other services for businesses and 
consumers without disrupting the incumbent television and other authorized services that 
operate in the TV bands.  The Commission is considering whether to also allow 
“personal/portable” WSDs to operate in the TV spectrum.
The Commission is considering two categories of devices for unlicensed 
operation in the TV white spaces.2 The first category consists of low-power 
“personal/portable” WSDs that will function similar to WiFi transceivers in laptop 
computers, and wireless in-home local area networks (LANs).  The second category 
consists of higher-powered “fixed/access” WSDs that would typically be operated from a 
fixed location and might be used to provide a commercial service such as wireless 
broadband access.  As established previously by the Commission, fixed white space 
devices will be allowed into the TV spectrum upon completion of the transition from 
analog to digital television broadcasts on February 17, 2009.3 The Commission is now 
  
1 First Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rule Making in the Matter of Unlicensed 
Operation in the TV Broadcast Bands, ET Docket No. 04-186 and 02-380, October 18, 2006 (hereinafter 
FNPRM).  While the focus of this proceeding is on unlicensed operation, the Commission has also 
requested comment on issues relevant to whether TV band low power devices should be allowed on a 
licensed or hybrid licensed/unlicensed basis.  It also requested comment as to whether, if unused TV 
spectrum were made available on a licensed basis, licensed devices should be required to incorporate the 
same type of interference avoidance mechanisms and be subject to the same low power limits that it 
proposed for unlicensed devices.

considering whether to allow non-fixed “personal/portable” WSDs to also operate in the 
TV spectrum. 
An important consideration in the proceeding is how to ensure that unlicensed 
devices operate only on vacant frequencies.  One approach under consideration is for the 
WSD to employ “smart radio” features that would use a “detect and avoid” or “spectrum 
sensing” strategy.  An alternative approach would rely on accessing a database of 
licensed services to identify active services near the device’s location. The device 
location would be determined by an integral geo-location technology, such as GPS.  This 
technique is commonly known as a “geolocation” detection approach.  A second issue is 
the potential for signals transmitted by a WSD to cause radio frequency interference 
(RFI) to incumbent users of these bands (i.e., TV reception and wireless microphone 
operations).  The Commission indicated that it would test prototype devices to collect 
technical information regarding both of these issues.
Consistent with the Commission’s plan for white space testing, the Office of 
Engineering and Technology (OET), through its Laboratory Division, performed initial 
tests of two prototype devices and issued a report on the results of those tests in July of 
2007.4 Subsequently, on October 5, 2007, OET issued a Public Notice inviting submittal 
of additional prototype devices for further tests (Phase II).5 On January 17, 2008, OET 
issued a test plan for the Phase II tests to help ensure that the testing would be open to 
outside observers, and announced that the testing would commence on January 24, 2008.6
Five parties responded to the announcement of the Phase II testing and provided 
prototype WSDs to the Laboratory for testing: Adaptrum, the Institute for Infocomm 
Research (I2R), Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft), Motorola Inc., and Philips 
Electronics North America Corp (Philips).7 The Microsoft devices malfunctioned during 
the test process and were not replaced.  The I2R device was submitted after the initial 
laboratory tests were completed.  As a result, not all the tests were performed on these 
two devices.  All of these prototypes have a sensing capability, but only two (Microsoft 
and Adaptrum) have a transmitter.  Since the Microsoft device malfunctioned before the 
transmitter tests were performed, its transmitter was not used in any of these tests.
This report describes the tests and measurements performed on the prototype 
WSDs and the results obtained, with focus on impacts to broadcast television and 
wireless microphone operations.  In particular, this report provides the results of tests of 
the spectrum sensing capabilities of the prototype devices as a means for identifying TV

channels unused by TV broadcast or wireless microphone operations and, where the 
devices included transmission capability, their emission characteristics and potential for 
causing interference to those services.  While other incumbent services operate in the TV 
bands, those services are not specifically being examined in this test program as the 
Commission has proposed other methods for protecting them from WSD operations.  
1.1 Test Scope and Approach
The Phase II tests first examined the devices in the laboratory under various 
controlled test conditions.  The WSDs’ ability to sense DTV signals was evaluated in 
several ways:  using a single DTV signal, with two DTV signals (one placed on an 
adjacent channel), and with recorded RF captures that exhibit various signal fading 
conditions.  Similarly, for those devices capable of sensing wireless microphones, tests 
were performed with wireless microphones alone and with DTV signals present on 
adjacent channels.  The wireless microphones were operated on various frequencies 
within a TV channel (both near the center of the channel and near the edges).
In preparation for the field tests, the performance of the devices in sensing off-
the-air signals was recorded at various locations in the laboratory.  Also, controlled tests 
of the Adaptrum transmitter were performed at the laboratory to estimate the distances at 
which it might cause interference to TV reception.  Finally with input from various 
interested parties, nine sites were selected for field tests of the device’s ability to sense 
TV signals, and two sites were chosen for field tests of their ability to sense wireless 
microphones.  The field sites were selected to represent a variety of environments 
including urban, suburban, rural, residential and business locations.  At two of the field 
test sites, anecdotal direct pick-up interference tests were performed to assess the impact 
of a WSD transmitter on cable TV reception.  The following sections and the appendices 
provide a tabulation of the data collected during the tests.

2 White Space Prototype Devices
2.1 Adaptrum Prototype White Space Device
Adaptrum indicates that its “Cognitive Radio (CR) Platform” is an integrated 
hardware and software development system that has been specifically designed for TV 
white space operation on UHF television channels 21-51.  The system is capable of 
various forms of TV signal sensing including waveform/signature sensing, spectral 
identification, signal power estimation, and network-level cooperative sensing.  It detects 
both analog and digital TV signals, but performs those functions in two separate scans.  It 
is not designed to detect wireless microphone signals.  The system is also capable of 
signal transmission in the TV bands with flexible waveform, modulation, and signal 
bandwidth construction.  It incorporates transmit power control and chain linearization to 
reduce adjacent channel interference.  The maximum transmitter output power 
specification is 100 mW (+20 dBm) over the selected bandwidth.  Figure 2-1 provides a 
photograph of the prototype device/platform.
Figure 2-1. Adaptrum Prototype WSD.
The key components of the platform are:  1) a wide-band high dynamic-range 
radio frequency (RF) transceiver operating over the frequency range 400 MHz to 1000 
MHz, 2) a field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based hardware development board 
with integrated high-speed analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and a high-density FPGA 
where CR baseband and protocol-layer functions are implemented, and 3) a Matlab-based 
integrated development environment (IDE) where the CR hardware functions are 
controlled using a Matlab graphical user interface (GUI) and Matlab scripts.
5
The scan time associated with this prototype device was initially 37 seconds per 
channel (sec/ch).  However, a software modification installed to improve the detection 
sensitivity with respect to DTV signals with offset pilot carriers slowed the scan time by 
a factor of five to 185 sec/ch.  Additional information can be obtained from the Adaptrum 
ex-parte filing in the subject rulemaking proceeding.8
2.2 Institute for Infocomm Research (I2R) Prototype White Space Device
The I2R prototype WSD operates on channels 21-51 and is capable of sensing 
analog and digital TV signals and wireless microphone signals.  The device consists of: 
1) a commercial TV tuner to receive television signals and translate them to their 
associated intermediate frequency (IF), 2) mixed-signal digital processing boards for 
performing ADC, downconversion and filtering, 3) a laptop computer used to configure 
the hardware, provide a GUI and generate reports, and 4) a fixed-length whip receive 
antenna.  
The (I2R) device was also able to detect wireless microphones.  It provided two 
scan modes – “DTV” and “All” and two test modes – “Lab” and “Field”.  In the DTV 
scan mode it searched only for DTV signals and in the “All” mode it searched only for 
microphones.  The “Lab” test mode was intended only for conducted bench testing and 
the “Field” mode was intended only for reception of radiated signals with an antenna. 
Figure 2-2 presents a photograph of the I2R prototype device/platform.  Additional 
information can be obtained from the I2R ex-parte filing in the subject rulemaking 
proceeding.9

2.3 Microsoft Prototype White Space Device 
The Microsoft WSD platform operates on channels 21-51 and is capable of 
sensing analog and digital TV signals and wireless microphone signals.  The system 
consists of two core system subassemblies: 1) a wide-band spectrum scanner, a network 
processor and a tunable UHF half-duplex transceiver controlled by the network processor 
and 2) a Windows-based laptop computer that utilizes the Internet Explorer browser to 
establish a command and control user interface via an Ethernet connection.  This device 
is also capable of transmitting on its operating channels.
The scanner/sensor function consists of a broadband (521-698 MHz) computer-
controlled frequency scanner and high-speed digitizer used to incrementally scan over 
UHF TV channels 21-51 in 6-MHz segments.  The accumulated digitized time-domain 
information is then passed to the network analyzer where a 2048-point Fast Fourier 
Transform (FFT) is performed.  Signal feature templates for DTV, analog TV, and 
wireless microphone waveforms are sequentially compared to the resulting FFT output to 
determine those channels occupied by DTV or analog TV signals.  Channels determined 
not to be occupied by DTV or analog TV signals are subsequently analyzed for potential 
narrowband incumbent signals such as wireless microphones.  Those channels 
determined not to be occupied by either DTV, analog TV, or wireless microphone signals 
are declared to be available “white space” channels.  User control and scanner results are 
provided via the laptop computer connection.
Figure 2-3.  Microsoft Prototype WSD.
The UHF transmitter assembly consists of three sub-components: 1) an S-Band 
(2.4 GHz) 802.11g OFDM modem; 2) a Half-duplex S-Band to UHF block converter; 
and 3) and a network processor browser to exercise control over frequency and power.  
Two external fixed-frequency bandpass filters were provided for use in transmitter 
testing.  A photograph of the Microsoft WSD platform is provided in Figure 2-3.

Additional information can be obtained from the Microsoft ex parte filings in the subject 
rulemaking proceeding.10
2.4 Motorola Prototype White Space Device
The Motorola WSD platform operates on channels 21-51 and includes capabilities 
for geo-location and sensing of digital TV signals.  It does not sense analog television 
signals or wireless microphone signals.  The system consists of a Cognitive Radio Rack 
and a laptop computer host connected via Ethernet.  The rack consists of a UHF radio and 
two PRO-3500 carrier boards co-located in a compact Peripheral Component 
Interconnect (PCI) chassis.  The cognitive engine runs on the lower board.
This WSD implements a geo-location-based approach as its primary method for 
the determination of occupied TV channels with a spectrum-sensing capability used to 
refine the results of the geo-location solution and to prioritize those channels found to be 
available.  The geo-location capability as tested requires the user to manually input the 
geographic coordinates and relies on a downloaded version of the FCC’s TV database for 
a particular geographic area.
This WSD exhibited the fastest scan execution time of 0.1 sec/ch.  A photograph 
of the Motorola WSD is provided in Figure 2-4.  More information can be obtained from 
Motorola ex parte filings in the subject rulemaking proceeding.11

2.5 Philips Prototype White Space Device
The Philips WSD platform operates on channels 21-51 and is capable of sensing 
analog and digital TV signals and wireless microphone signals consists of: 1) a 
commercial TV tuner for tuning to a specified television channel and translating to IF, 2) 
a digital signal processing board for ADC and processing and 3) a desktop computer used 
to configure the hardware, provide a GUI and store detection results.
Philips claims that the prototype WSD will scan UHF channels 21-51 and detect 
ATSC (DTV), NTSC (analog TV) or wireless microphones to a level of at least -114 
dBm over a 6-MHz television channel.  The channel scan time for this device varies 
between 8 and 50 sec/ch due to the sequential application of separate ATSC, NTSC and 
wireless microphone detection algorithms.  
Figure 2-5 presents a photograph of the Philips WSD platform.  Additional 
information can be obtained from Philips ex-parte filing in the subject rulemaking 
proceeding.12

3 DTV Scanning/Spectrum Sensing Capability Tests
This section describes the laboratory measurements performed on each of the 
prototype WSDs submitted for testing.  For the sensing measurements performed in the 
laboratory, a simulated or recorded signal was applied to the antenna input of the WSD 
prototype utilizing a coaxial cable connection (i.e., conducted measurements).  As such, 
the effects of the WSD receive antenna were ignored.  
Ignoring the WSD receive antenna contribution is analogous to assuming an 
isotropic receive antenna (i.e., a theoretical antenna having uniform gain and directivity).
An isotropic receive antenna for ultra-high frequency (UHF) operation represents an ideal 
that cannot be physically realized.  Rather, the receive antenna of WSDs will likely have 
low and variable (or negative gain) and thus the results reported herein would have to be 
adjusted accordingly to describe practical devices. These measurements also make no 
effort to quantify other potential contributors to television signal loss such as might be 
experienced from shielding/absorption effects introduced by proximate human bodies.
The general approach to these tests was to provide a DTV input signal at 
progressively lower amplitude levels until the prototype could no longer detect it with 
complete (100%) reliability. 
It is recognized that some of the WSD detection algorithms interpret detection 
reliability as low as 50% as indicative of an occupied channel, but the design intentions 
of the algorithms in other devices were not readily apparent.
3.1 Clean DTV Signal Measurements
The objective of the clean DTV signal measurements was to determine the 
detection sensitivity of the scanning/sensing capability of the WSD prototype devices 
submitted for evaluation with respect to a “clean” (undistorted) DTV signal.  
For these measurements the input was a single, simulated DTV signal produced 
by a Rhode and Schwarz DTV Test Broadcast System (SFU).  The generated DTV signal 
was provided to the antenna input of the WSD prototype under test via a coaxial cable.  
An external variable attenuator bank was used to adjust the signal power.  Block 
diagrams showing the measurement equipment and related interconnections in addition to 
detailed equipment information are provided in Appendix A.  The detailed procedure 
used to perform these measurements follows:
· The SFU was used to produce a single, clean DTV signal that was provided via 
coaxial cable through a variable attenuator and into the RF input of a spectrum 
analyzer. 
· With the variable attenuator set to zero, the SFU power control was adjusted to 
produce an average power level of -60 dBm/6 MHz, referenced to the input 
connection of the spectrum analyzer.  This level provides a displayed signal-to-
10
noise ratio (S/N) of at least 20 dB.  The signal power was measured using a root-
mean-square (rms) detector and averaged over 100 sweeps.
· The cable from the SFU was then removed from the analyzer input and connected 
to the antenna input of the WSD prototype.
· The SFU-generated DTV signal was further attenuated using the external variable 
attenuator bank from the -60 dBm level to a level slightly higher than the 
expected detection threshold (e.g., the variable attenuator was typically set to 
provide an additional 54 dB attenuation so as to produce an initial input signal 
level of -114 dBm)
· Thirty (30) independent detection trials were performed with the WSD tuned to 
channel 21 (lowest channel in tuning range).  The number of successful detections 
of an occupied channel was recorded.
· If the successful detection rate over the thirty trials was 100%, the input signal 
power was reduced by increasing the variable attenuator by 1 dB and the 
procedure repeated.
· If the successful detection rate over the thirty trials was less than 100%, then the 
input signal power was increased by decreasing the variable attenuator by 1 dB 
and the procedure repeated.
· This iterative process was repeated until the DTV power level was found where 
the WSD prototype could no longer detect the occupying signal in the channel 
with 100% reliability.
· Additional data points were then collected above and below this breakpoint. 
· The process was repeated in its entirety on two additional test channels, 36 and 
51, representing the middle and upper channels within the tuning range, 
respectively.13  
The figures that follow represent the results obtained from the clean signal DTV 
sensing measurements for each of the WSD prototype devices.  Two separate plots are 
provided for the I2R device, representing results obtained in the two available modes of 
operation (“laboratory” test mode and the “field” test mode).  The field test mode utilizes 
separate circuitry to suppress spurious reception.
  
13 The Adaptrum device was found to be particularly prone to false detections on channel 36, likely because
of the presence of an OTA signal on the channel.  Thus, channel 37 was used as the middle test channel for 
this device.

3.2 Recorded (Captured) DTV Signal Measurements
The objective of the recorded DTV signal measurements was to determine the 
detection sensitivity of the scanning/sensing capability of the WSD prototype devices 
with respect to recorded over-the-air DTV signals that incorporate “real world” signal 
distortions resulting from reflections, multi-path fading, and other factors.  
The signal input for these measurements consisted of a set of twelve recorded 
DTV waveforms (“captures”) selected by the IEEE 802.22 subcommittee.14 Detailed 
information, including frequency domain and temporal representations of each of these 
twelve waveforms, is provided in Appendix B of this report.  
A Wavetech Services WS-2100 RF player® was used to play back the captures on 
the desired RF channel and to provide them to the antenna input of each of the WSD 
prototypes via coaxial cable.  Two external variable attenuator banks were utilized to 
adjust the power level of the input signal.  A 75-50 ? transformer was utilized at the 
Wavetech player output to match system impedance.
Although different algorithms are utilized among the prototype devices to detect 
the presence of a DTV signal, they all appear to share a similarity in that they all sample 
the spectrum in proximity of an anticipated DTV pilot signal.  However, the amount of 
time dedicated to sampling and signal processing differs significantly among the 
prototype devices.  Since there are significant instantaneous temporal variations in many 
of the RF captures over their 25-second playback period (see Appendix B), the resulting 
detection decisions can also vary depending on when the sampling actually occurs.  
Efforts were made to minimize this variable (e.g., the waveform playback was restarted 
for each independent trial); however its effect is evident in the results obtained from some 
of the prototype devices.  Another method for reducing this variability is to increase the 
number of trials beyond the stated number of thirty.  For some of the devices, the 
additional time required to execute more than thirty trials was excessive and was thus 
deemed impractical.  However, for others (e.g., the Motorola WSD), it was practical to 
perform additional trials.  Therefore, for this device, in addition to performing the 
measurement over thirty independent trials, a second measurement was also performed 
utilizing one thousand independent trials.  The results of both measurements are provided 
herein.
After the laboratory measurements were completed but before the field trials 
commenced, the prototype manufacturers were offered an opportunity to make minor 
adjustments to their devices based on the laboratory results.  For example, one issue 
observed by the manufacturer of the Adaptrum prototype was difficulty in detecting a 
DTV signal having a frequency offset pilot tone. As a result, Adaptrum utilized this 
opportunity to improve this with a software modification.15 A second set of data is 
presented for the Adaptrum device showing the effect of this modification.

Block diagrams showing the measurement equipment and related interconnections 
in addition to detailed equipment information are provided in Appendix A.  The 
measurement procedure was as follows:
· A Wavetech Services WS-2100 RF player® was used to play back each of twelve 
recorded DTV signals and provide the RF output via coaxial cable through an 
external variable attenuator bank and into the RF input of a spectrum analyzer. 
· With the external variable attenuators set to zero, the average output signal power 
in the channel bandwidth was measured using the spectrum analyzer (over 100-
sweeps utilizing an rms detector).
· The coaxial cable was then removed from the RF input of the analyzer and 
connected to the receive antenna input of the prototype device.
· The signal was further attenuated using the variable attenuator bank to achieve a 
power level near the threshold level recorded in Section 3.1.
· Thirty (30) independent trials were performed and the number of successful 
detections recorded.16 Since the data from the Section 3.1 indicated relative 
consistency over the three channels examined, these tests were performed only on 
a single channel (typically channel 36, mid-channel in the WSD tuning range).17
· If the successful detection rate over the thirty scans was 100%, then the input 
signal power was reduced by increasing the attenuation by 1 dB and the procedure 
repeated.
· If the successful detection rate over the thirty scans was less than 100%, then the 
input signal power was increased by reducing the attenuation by 1 dB and the 
procedure repeated.
· The process was repeated until the DTV power level was found where the WSD 
prototype could no longer detect the signal in the channel with 100% reliability.
· Additional data points were then collected above and below this breakpoint. 
The results of these measurements are provided in the figures that follow.
  
16 For some devices, an additional measurement was performed utilizing more than 30 trials (see discussion 
in previous text).
17 The Adaptrum device was found to be particularly prone to false detections on channel 36, likely because 
of the presence of an OTA signal on the channel.  Thus, channel 37 was used as the middle test channel for 
this device.

3.3 Two-Signal (Adjacent Channel Interference) Measurements
The objective of the two-signal adjacent-channel interference measurements was 
to assess the potential for degradation to the DTV signal detection capability when 
another DTV signal is present on an adjacent channel.  Because of equipment limitations, 
these measurements were limited to assessing the effect of one adjacent channel at a time 
(i.e., two-signals, one on the detection channel and one on an adjacent channel).  The 
effects of DTV signals on both first- and second-adjacent channels were tested.
Detection threshold measurements were made in a manner similar to that 
described in Section 3.1, but included one additional DTV signal placed sequentially on 
the first (N±1) and then second (N±2) adjacent channels relative to the detection channel.  
Detection threshold measurements were performed with the adjacent-channel signal 
power set to the -28 dBm (high), -53 dBm (moderate) and -68 dBm (low) levels.  It 
should be noted that DTV signal levels in “real world” environments can exceed -28 dBm 
and actual examples of this were observed in the field test component of this effort (see 
Section 5.2).
For these measurements, the R&S SFU was used to generate the adjacent-channel 
DTV signal.  The Wavetech player was used to play back a “clean” DTV signal (Zone 
Plate test signal) in the detection channel.  The power level of the adjacent channel DTV 
20
signal was set using the SFU’s internal power controls and verified with a spectrum 
analyzer.  The power level of the detection-channel signal was set utilizing a bank of 
external variable attenuators and verified with a spectrum analyzer.
The SFU provides a good representation of a DTV signal within the 6 MHz TV 
channel passband but it does not precisely match the out-of-band characteristics of 
operating DTV stations (i.e., the “DTV Mask” for full service stations).  Therefore, in 
order to preclude the possibility of excessive signal leakage (“splatter”) from the adjacent 
channel into the detection channel, the DTV signal was filtered through a 7-pole RF 
bandpass filter in order to more accurately simulate the out-of-band characteristics of a 
“real world” DTV broadcast signal.  
The filter employed was a Micro Communications, Inc. fixed-tuned Interdigital 
Bandpass (IDBP) filter.18 Passing the SFU-generated DTV waveform through this filter 
provides out-of-band characteristics that adhere to the DTV emissions mask (see 
Appendix A).19 However, since the filter is fixed-tuned to channel 29, the adjacent-
channel signal had to be maintained on channel 29 while the detection channel was varied 
to represent the N±1 and N±2 relationships with respect to the detection channel.  For 
example, in order to examine the effect of an N+1 adjacent channel interaction, the SFU 
DTV signal (representing the adjacent-channel signal) was generated on channel 29 and 
the Wavetech DTV signal (representing the detection-channel signal) was generated on 
channel 28.  Likewise, the N-1 adjacent channel scenario was simulated by transmitting 
the detection signal on channel 30 and the N+2 and N-2 scenarios were simulated by 
transmitting the detection signals on channels 27 and 31, respectively, while the adjacent-
channel DTV signal remained on channel 29.
During the course of these measurements, the Microsoft prototype sample device 
began to malfunction and eventually ceased to operate, necessitating the abandonment of 
further measurements utilizing this device.
As mentioned above, before the field trials were initiated, the prototype 
manufacturers were offered an opportunity to make minor adjustments to modify their 
devices based on the bench-test results.  One issue observed by the manufacturer of the 
Motorola prototype was degradation to the detection capability in the presence of an 
adjacent-channel DTV signal (particularly one at moderate and higher power levels).  
Motorola utilized this opportunity to add an automatic gain control (AGC) circuit to the 
device.20 This necessitated that a second set of laboratory data be collected from this 
prototype to demonstrate and verify the effect of the modification.

Block diagrams showing the measurement equipment and related interconnections 
in addition to detailed equipment information are provided in Appendix A.  
The measurement procedure was as follows:
· The SFU was used to generate a DTV waveform on channel 29 that was delivered 
via coaxial cable through a fixed-tuned bandpass filter to provide the adjacent-
channel signal.  The Wavetech player was used to playback another DTV 
waveform on the pertinent detection channel.  The detection-channel signal was 
provided via coaxial cable through a bank of external variable attenuators and 
combined with the adjacent channel signal.  The combined signals were split with 
one output connected with coaxial cable to the antenna input of the WSD 
prototype device and the other output connected with identical coaxial to a 
spectrum analyzer.  A block diagram of this set-up is provided in Appendix A.
· The SFU-generated adjacent-channel signal was set to produce a signal with 
amplitude of -28 dBm at the spectrum analyzer input.  For subsequent 
measurements, this same procedure was used to set the adjacent-channel signal 
power to -53 dBm (representing a moderate level) and -68 dBm (representing a 
low level), respectively. 
· The Wavetech RF player was set-up to provide the detection signal on channel 28, 
simulating an N+1 adjacent-channel scenario (i.e., channel 28 detection channel 
with a second DTV signal in the upper adjacent channel 29).  In subsequent 
measurements, the output channel of the Wavetech player was set to channel 30 
(N-1), channel 27 (N+2), and channel 31 (N-2) to represent the remaining three 
adjacent-channel scenarios under examination. 
· With the external variable attenuator set to zero, the power in the detection 
channel was measured with the spectrum analyzer.  Using this measurement as a 
baseline, the variable attenuator banks were adjusted to reduce the signal power in 
the detection channel to a level near the previously observed detection threshold.
· Thirty (30) independent trials of the WSD detector were performed in the 
detection channel and the number of successful detections was recorded.
· If the successful detection rate over the thirty independent trials was 100%, then 
the input signal power was reduced (by increasing the signal attenuation) and the 
procedure repeated.
· If the successful detection rate over the thirty trials was less than 100%, then the 
input signal power was increased (by decreasing the signal attenuation) and the 
procedure repeated.
· The process was repeated until the DTV power level was found where the WSD 
prototype could no longer detect the signal with 100% reliability.
22
· Additional data points were collected at levels above and below this breakpoint. 
The data resulting from these measurements are presented below in Table 3-1.  
Only the final signal level where 100% correct detection was observed is reported in this 
table.

3.4 Transmitter Measurements
3.4.1 Conducted Measurement 
The objective of the conducted transmitter measurements was to examine the 
emitted spectral characteristics of those WSD prototype devices having a transmit 
function.  Two of the originally-provided WSD prototypes include active transmitters, the 
Adaptrum and Microsoft devices.  Prior to these measurements, the Microsoft device 
malfunctioned.  However, the spectral characteristics associated with the Microsoft WSD 
transmitter are expected to be unchanged from those measured and reported in the Phase I 
measurements.21
The Adaptrum WSD was used with an external wide-band amplifier to boost the 
power applied to the transmit antenna. The emission spectrum was measured by 
connecting the transmitter/amplifier output through a 30 dB attenuator to a spectrum 
analyzer.  Figure 3-13 presents the resulting spectral plot.

Adaptrum Transmiter Spectra
Figure 3-19.  Adaptrum Transmitter Emission Spectrum.
The following information can be determined from this data:
· The bandwidth of the transmitted signal is approximately 4.5 MHz.
· The out-of-band (channel) emission (OOBE) suppression is slightly more than 
86.5 dB (60 dB + 10 log(4.5 MHz/10 kHz)) relative to the total power in the 
carrier.
· The output power is shown as -36 dBm as measured in a 10-kHz resolution 
bandwidth.  This converts to a level of -9.5 dBm (-36 + 10log (4.5 MHz/10 kHz)) 
in the 4.5 MHz emission bandwidth.  A 30-dB external attenuator was utilized to 
protect the spectrum analyzer from overload and the coaxial cable loss was 
measured at 1.2 dB.  Therefore, the final conducted output power from the WSD 
is (-9.5 + 30 + 1.2) = 21.7 dBm or approximately 150 milliwatts.
24
3.4.2 Radiated Measurement
Measurements were made to derive the equivalent isotropically radiated power 
(EIRP) based on measurements of the radiated power of the transmitter in the Adaptrum 
WSD prototype.  In order to determine the EIRP of this device’s transmitter, a set of 
radiated measurements were performed utilizing the laboratory’s semi-anechoic chamber.  
For these measurements, the WSD was placed atop a wooden test bench that is mounted 
on a turntable and activated in the transmit mode of operation.  A calibrated laboratory-
grade receive antenna was affixed to a variable-height mast at a separation distance of 3-
meters relative to the transmit antenna.  The WSD transmit antenna and the calibrated 
receive antenna were varied in relative orientation (e.g., with respect to polarization, 
height and angular position) until a maximum signal level was obtained on a spectrum 
analyzer.  This measurement process was repeated on three distinct frequencies 
representing the lower, middle and upper tuning range of the transmitter.  The maximum 
received signal level was recorded at each frequency.  
The maximum EIRP of the transmitter can be determined from the measured 
maximum received power by applying the following equation:
EIRP = PR – GR + LC + LP (1)
where;
PR =  received power measured with the spectrum analyzer, in dBm,
GR  =  receive antenna gain, in dBi,
LC  =  signal attenuation in coaxial connecting cable, in dB,
LP  =  free space propagation path loss, in dB.
The receive antenna gain was determined from manufacturer-provided calibration 
data, the signal attenuation in the connecting coaxial cable was measured and the free-
space propagation path loss22 was calculated for each measurement frequency.  The 
parameters used in Equation (1) along with the results are provided in Table 3-2 below.
  
22 RF absorbing material was placed over the conductive floor of the chamber so that contributions from 
reflected waves could be ignored.

3.5 Miscellaneous Laboratory Measurements
This section describes some miscellaneous measurements performed on the 
WSDs that were not a part of the original test plan.  These measurements were typically 
undertaken to help explain unusual and/or unexpected observations. 
In preparation for the field trials, the detection capabilities of the prototype 
devices were first exercised in the over-the-air environment at the laboratory facility 
(sensing the real world environment, not laboratory test signals).  Several of the devices 
indicated that all (or most) channels were occupied even though it was known that 
unoccupied (available) channels existed at the laboratory.  
These miscellaneous measurements represent an attempt to investigate working 
hypotheses regarding these unanticipated observations. Since these measurements were 
solely exploratory, they were not necessarily performed consistently over the set of all 
prototype devices.  In fact, because of the late submission of the I2R device, none of 
these measurements were performed with it.  In other cases, only a partial suite was 
performed, particularly if preliminary results did not raise concerns.
The first of these measurements consisted of exercising the detection capability of 
the WSD device using its associated antenna at locations within the laboratory (indoors), 
in the laboratory’s parking lot (outdoors), and inside of the laboratory’s semi-anechoic 
chamber.  When some of the devices indicated significant channel occupancy inside the 
anechoic chamber (where all environmental UHF signals are significantly attenuated), a 
set of measurements were performed to examine possible explanations.  Radiated 
measurements were performed to determine the spurious energy emitted by the 
prototypes under the assumption that at sufficient intensity they may trigger false 
detections.  No effort was made to isolate the source of the spurious emissions among the 
individual system components.
The results of these measurements are presented in Appendix H. The tables 
provided in Section H.1 provide the results obtained from exercising the WSD 
sensing/detection capability within the laboratory.  Section H.2 presents spectral plots 
representing the data collected from the radiated spurious emissions measurements.  
These tables and plots show that many of the prototype platforms generate emissions 
internally at levels that create a potential for degrading a device’s detection capability (in 
the form of high missed detection and/or false alarm rates).
26
3.6 Summary of Laboratory Measurement Results
The following table summarizes the results obtained from the laboratory 
measurements performed with each of the WSD prototype devices.

Philips -123 to -126 -113 to -128 Unknown to -123
Note:  Thresholds are referenced to device antenna input (receive antenna characteristics ignored).
The clean signal results indicate that the measured detection threshold ranges 
between -116 and -126 dBm (ignoring the I2R results in field test mode) over the 
complete set of prototype devices.  The results also indicate that the detection threshold is 
relatively consistent over the tuning range of the device.
The measured detection thresholds with respect to the twelve DTV waveform 
captures range between -106 and -128 dBm over the total set of prototype devices.  
Variability observed in the results of the waveform capture tests when compared with the 
results of the clean waveform tests is explained partly by temporal amplitude variations 
in the recorded waveform.
The adjacent-channel sensitivity measurements indicate that moderate-to-strong 
DTV signals occupying channels adjacent to the detection channel can significantly 
degrade detection capability, thereby affecting the ability of a device to reliably detect 
DTV signals.  
Transmitter measurements on the one WSD with transmit capability demonstrated 
a clean output spectra with good out-of-band emission (OOBE) suppression.  The 
maximum EIRP of the device was determined to nominally be +22 dBm (~150 mW) over 
the tuning range and the OOBE suppression was found to be at least -86.5 dB.
The miscellaneous measurements showed that many of the prototype platforms 
generate emissions internally, at levels that create a potential for degrading the devices’ 
detection capabilities (in the form of high missed detection and/or false alarm rates).

4 WSD Transmitter Interference Tests and Demonstrations
This section describes transmitter interference tests performed as a part of the 
Phase II measurement effort.  These tests are considered anecdotal for a number of 
reasons.  For example, the use of over-the-air signals implies that little control could be 
exercised upon significant test variables.  In addition, since the tests were performed at a 
limited number of locations and at particular times of day, variations in signal level 
occurred which could not be characterized.  Also, since the Adaptrum WSD prototype 
was the only available working device with a transmitter, the interference effects to DTV 
reception were examined for only the waveform of this particular device, which may or 
may not be representative of a final TV white space product.
These tests all utilized the Adaptrum WSD transmitter to radiate an undesired 
signal while the potential victim receive system was monitored visually for interference. 
Attempts were made to operate the victim receiver in a minimum desired signal condition 
to represent a worst-case interference scenario.
Section 4.1 describes a test performed to assess potential adjacent-channel and co-
channel interference interactions when a proximate DTV receive system is tuned to a 
station near the recognized threshold of visibility (TOV) of -84 dBm.  This test was 
performed within the FCC laboratory facility.  
Section 4.2 describes tests performed at two of the residential field trial sites to 
assess the potential for interference to the reception of cable television programming via 
the direct pick-up of an undesired WSD-transmitted signal either by the coaxial 
cable/connections, the television tuner and/or a set-top converter box.  In these tests, the 
precise interference entry point was not identified.
4.1 Channel Interference Potential to DTV 
The objective of this test was to examine interference distances between the 
prototype WSD transmitter and a typical consumer-installed DTV receiving system, with 
WSD transmissions either on the same or on an adjacent channel relative to a weak-signal 
DTV signal.  The co-channel scenario is one that should be avoided by the WSD channel 
detection scheme, but is investigated as a part of this effort in order to provide an 
estimate of the interference distance in the case where the detection scheme fails to 
identify a weak-signal occupied channel. 
4.1.1 Undesired Signal (U) Transmission System  
The undesired signal was produced by the Adaptrum transmitter coupled with an 
external 21 dB gain wideband amplifier.  The WSD is capable of transmitting an OFDM 
signal with a signal bandwidth adjustable from 0.5 to 18 MHz.  A vertically-polarized 
planar bi-conical transmit antenna at a height of 2 meters (6.6 feet) above ground level 
(AGL) was used to radiate the signal generated by the transmitter.  The EIRP of the WSD 
prototype transmitter was measured in the semi-anechoic chamber and determined to 
28
nominally be +22 dBm (~150 mW).  See Section 3.4 for details.  Figure 4-1 presents a 
photograph of the WSD signal transmission system on the laboratory grounds.
Figure 4-1. Adaptrum WSD Prototype Transmit System.
4.1.2 Desired Signal (D) Receive System  
The receive system used in these tests consisted of a consumer-grade 
horizontally-polarized television antenna (Radio Shack VU-90XR) mounted at a height 
of 9.3 meters (30.5 feet) on the rotor-driven extendable mast of an FCC measurement 
truck and connected via coaxial cable sequentially to 1) an Agilent E7405A spectrum 
analyzer with internal pre-amplifier and 2) a commercial set-top box with a late-
generation DTV tuner (Magnavox) feeding a consumer DTV receiver (JVC).  See 
Figures 4-2 and 4-3 for photographs of the desired signal receive and measurement 
system.
29
Figure 4-2.  FCC Measurement Truck.
Figure 4-3.  DTV Receive System.
4.1.3 Test Methodology
The following test procedure was used for the transmitter field tests:
· The DTV receive antenna was mounted on the extendable mast of the FCC 
measurement truck and elevated to 9.3 meters (30.5 feet) above ground level 
(AGL) to simulate a consumer-installed roof-top mounted antenna.  The truck was 
parked on one end of the FCC laboratory property.
30
· A 75-50 ? transformer was used to connect the antenna through the antenna feed 
(coaxial cable) to a spectrum analyzer. 
· The antenna was rotated and the spectrum analyzer used to examine the received 
power levels associated with all available DTV channels.
· Power measurements were compared to determine the weakest receivable signal.  
This signal was used as the desired signal in these tests.  By this method, channel 
30 (WNVT-DT in Goldvein, VA, approximately 50-miles distant) was selected as 
the desired channel for this test.  The measured channel power of WNVT-DT was 
found to vary between -75 and -77 dBm at the test location.
· The antenna feed was then switched from the spectrum analyzer to the set-top box 
and the signal content displayed on the DTV receiver.
· The signal was observed to produce a stable picture without obvious artifacts.
· A step attenuator was inserted into the signal path and the desired signal was 
attenuated in 1 dB steps until the picture was lost.  By this method it was 
determined that a 5-6 dB margin existed between the received and threshold 
signal levels.  This confirmed the TOV of the receiver to be within the range -80 
to -83 dBm.
· The Adaptrum WSD transmit system (transmitter and supplied antenna) was 
initially placed at a distance of 12.2 meters (40 feet) from the base of the receive 
antenna mast along the same radial as the receive antenna boresight and oriented 
to maximize mainbeam-to-mainbeam coupling (not considering cross-polarization 
losses).  The transmitter was tuned to each of the immediately adjacent channels 
(29 and 31) and the OFDM signal was transmitted at full power in a 4.5 MHz 
bandwidth.  No interference was observed to the set-top box/DTV receiver while 
receiving WNVT programming on channel 30.
· The distance was decremented in 3.1 meters (10 feet) steps and the adjacent-
channel tests repeated.  No adjacent-channel interference was observed on the 
DTV at any distance; however, alternative test configurations were not explored.
· This test was repeated with a transmit bandwidth of 6 MHz.  Again, no 
interference could be produced with the WSD transmitter tuned to either of the 
immediately adjacent channels.
· The WSD transmitter was then tuned to channel 30 (co-channel) with an emission 
bandwidth of 4.5 MHz.  
· The transmit antenna was initially placed at a distance of 45.7 meters (150 feet)
from the base of the receive antenna along the same radial as before.  
31
· The transmitter was activated at full power.  Interference was immediately 
observed in the form of complete loss of the television picture.
· The transmit channel was changed to 31 in order to isolate from the desired signal 
and the power through the receiver chain measured.  It was determined that at this 
distance, the undesired power level was 28 dB above the desired power (D/U = -
28 dB) which suggested that considerable additional distance would likely have to 
be realized to mitigate the interference (i.e., to achieve a D/U of 15 dB requires 43 
dB additional attenuation of the undesired signal).
· In order to achieve as much attenuation as possible from distance separation 
(while still maintaining a line-of-sight propagation path), the transmitter and 
receiver systems were separated as far as practical within in the confines of the 
laboratory property.
· The maximum distance that could be practically obtained between the transmitter 
system and the receiver system while staying within the receive antenna 
mainbeam was 360 meters (1180 feet).  The transmitter was again activated at full 
power within a 4.5-MHz bandwidth and co-tuned with the desired signal (on 
channel 30).  Interference was once again observed as a complete loss of picture.  
The desired signal level was measured on channel 30 and determined to be -76.9 
dBm and the undesired signal level was measured on channel 31 and determined 
to be -77.4 dBm (D/U = 0.5 dB)
· Since no greater distance separation could be practically realized, a step attenuator 
was placed between the transmitter amplifier and antenna and used to further 
attenuate the undesired signal until the interference was eliminated.  It was found 
that an additional 15 dB of attenuation was required to resolve the interference 
(D/U = 15.5 dB).  The results of this test are summarized in Table 4-1.
· The test was repeated with the WSD transmitter located to the side and behind the 
DTV receive antenna, in order to observe the variation in interference level as the 
WSD was moved off boresight of the receive antenna (away from the axis of 
symmetry of the mainbeam).  The resulting data are summarized in Table 4-2.  
The approximate locations associated with the side- and back-lobe tests are shown 
in the aerial image provided as Figure 4-4.

4.2 Direct Pick-Up Interference to Cable Service 
Anecdotal checks for direct pick-up interference to cable service were performed 
at the two residential test sites with cable television subscriptions (the third residential 
site did not subscribe to cable service).  The intent was to observe the susceptibility of 
cable TV reception to interference caused by the direct pick-up of emissions from a WSD 
prototype transmitter.  This interference mechanism has been previously examined and 
documented by the FCC laboratory.23
Consumer cable service networks in the United States typically utilize quadrature-
amplitude-modulated (QAM) signals to provide digital television programming.  This 
requires a dedicated QAM demodulator, distinct from that used to demodulate ATSC 8-
VSB broadcast signals.  Many DTV receivers include both QAM and ATSC 8-VSB 
demodulators to permit reception of digital cable signals without the need for a separate 
set-top box.  A DTV equipped with a QAM tuner can thus receive unencrypted digital 
cable TV programming (and also encrypted cable programming if equipped with an 
active CableCard).  
The frequency plan of cable channels differ from the frequency plan of broadcast 
television channels.  Cable channels are offset in frequency relative to over-the-air 
(broadcast) channel allocations.24 Cable channels also use different numeric designations 
and include channels on frequencies not used by broadcast television.  At each test site, it 
was necessary to find an analog and an unencrypted (clear QAM) digital cable channel 
whose frequencies overlapped the spectrum of a broadcast channel within the tuning 
range of the Adaptrum prototype WSD transmitter.  
4.2.1 Field Test Site 3 (Residential)
Cable channel 73, (519.0 ± 3.0 MHz) was identified as an analog cable channel 
available at this test site.  The Adaptrum WSD prototype can tune its transmitter to 
channel 21 (515.0 ± 3.0 MHz), which overlaps cable channel 73.  Therefore, this channel 
combination was used to observe the interference potential to analog CATV reception at 
test site 3.
First, a spectrum analyzer was used to measure the channel power at the cable 
service outlet, utilizing a 75-50? transformer.   The measured channel power from the 
cable TV outlet at site 3 was -7 dBmV.  The applicable standard states that the carrier 
level at the “input terminals of the first device located on the subscriber premises” should 
be  -12 to +15 dBmV.25 A step attenuator was inserted into the cable signal path and

used to reduce the power on channel 73 at the DTV “cable” input to -11 dBmV (1 dB 
above the minimum specified level).
The cable service was then attached to the “cable” input of a digital widescreen 
television, bypassing the existing cable routing (including a distribution amplifier, 
splitters, various cables, and a set-top converter box).  Figure 4-5 presents a line-diagram 
of the cable receive system at test site 3.  The DTV receiver was tuned to cable channel 
73 and a good quality analog picture was observed.
Figure 4-5.  Line Diagram of Cable TV Receive System at Test Site #3.
Interference to Analog Cable Service. The Adaptrum antenna was placed on a tripod at 
a height of approximately 1.5 meters and approximately 1 meter horizontally distant from 
the TV.  The antenna was connected to the WSD transmitter output port via coaxial cable 
through a step attenuator and mounted in its normal polarization (vertical).  The prototype 
transmitter was tuned to channel 21 and activated at full power (no external attenuation).  
The picture quality on the cable channel was observed to be significantly degraded.  The 
Adaptrum prototype provides for a variable transmit bandwidth.  Using that feature, the 
transmit bandwidth was reset from 4.5 MHz to 6.0 MHz and the demonstration repeated.  
Interference to the TV became noticeably worse. 
The cable service signal path was changed to include the existing cable routing 
(including the distribution amplifier, etc., but without the converter box) and the test was 
repeated.  Again, interference was observed on the TV receiver and was also noted on an 
analog TV in an adjacent room, which was tuned to channel 73, in the form of a complete 
loss of picture.
The step attenuator in the transmitter signal path was used to decrease the 
transmitted signal level from the maximum power (+22 dBm EIRP based on data 
presented in Section 3.4) in 1 dB steps while observing the DTV for interference.  With 
15 dB of signal attenuation (7 dBm EIRP), the interference was barely perceptible (on 
either TV).  
Interference to Digital Cable Service. Next, an attempt was made to observe the 
interference potential from the WSD transmitter to a digital cable (QAM) channel.  Cable 
channel 77 (543.0 ± 3.0 MHz) was identified as a clear QAM Cable TV channel available 
at this test site.  The Adaptrum WSD prototype transmitter can tune to broadcast TV 
channel 26 (545.0 ± 3.0 MHz), which overlaps CATV channel 77.  Therefore, this 
channel combination was used in the demonstration.
35
The digital widescreen TV was tuned to channel 77 but could not demodulate the 
signal.  Thus, a demonstration of the interference potential to the TV’s QAM tuner could 
not be performed at this site.
The cable converter (set-top) box was inserted into the signal path and connected 
to the DTV’s tuner input.  The set-top box was tuned to virtual channel 220 (cable 
channel 77) and a good quality digital picture was observed.  The Adaptrum transmitter 
was tuned to channel 26 and activated at full power (no external attenuation).  
Interference was immediately observed in the form of a complete loss of picture.
The variable attenuator was incrementally increased to reduce the radiated power 
in 1 dB steps. At a reduction of 18 dB (4 dBm EIRP) the picture reappeared.  The 
attenuation in the cable signal path was removed and the test repeated.  Picture loss was 
again observed at a transmit attenuation setting of 12 dB (10 dBm EIRP).
Finally, all of the existing routing from the cable service wall outlet to the 
converter box (including amplifier, splitters and cables) was removed and replaced with a 
laboratory-grade patch connecting the wall outlet and the converter box input.  The 
Adaptrum transmitter was reset to its maximum power (all external attenuation removed) 
and turned on.  No interference was observed until the transmit antenna was moved very 
close to the converter box (within 0.3 meters).
Tentative Conclusions at Test Site #3
• The residence’s wiring, preamps, and television receivers were susceptible to 
direct pick-up (DPU) interference in analog mode.
• The cable converter set-top box operating in QAM mode was almost immune 
to interference from the WSD transmitter (this set-top box was not tested in 
the analog mode).
4.2.2 Field Test Site 6 (Residential) 
A line diagram of the cable service receive system at test site #6 is presented as 
Figure 4-6.  Digital cable signals were processed by the digital set top box; analog cable 
signals passed through the digital set top box and were processed by the 
tuner/demodulator set top box.
36
Figure 4-6. Line Diagram of Cable TV Receive System at Test Site #6.
The peak visual carrier level on cable channel 72 (511.25 MHz)26 from the 
connector at the wall was measured at +1 dBmV.27 No additional attenuation was used 
for the tests at this site.  
Interference to Analog Cable Service.  The Adaptrum transmitter was set to operate 
with a 6 MHz transmit bandwidth on TV channel 21 (512–518) MHz, and its antenna was 
located about two meters from the analog cable converter box (which fed via HDMI a 
video monitor).  The picture showed perceptible interference (TASO Grade 3) when the 
transmitter was energized.  The antenna was then relocated about one foot from the set 
top box and the picture degraded further and showed definitely objectionable interference 
(TASO Grade 5).  
With the WSD antenna located about two meters from the analog cable converter 
box the transmit power output from the WSD was reduced in one decibel steps until the 
interference became barely visible on the video monitor.  This threshold of visibility was 
found at +13 dBm (9 dB below full transmitter output power).
Interference to Digital Cable Service.  The Adaptrum transmitter was set to operate on 
TV Channel 30 (566–572 MHz).  The cable signal path ran from the wall outlet through a 
splitter to a digital cable converter set top box.28 Cable channel 81 (564–570 MHz) was 
used for the tests; the measured channel power in 6 MHz was -7 dBmV.29 The 256 QAM
cable channel provided six program streams, corresponding to virtual channels 2, 4, 5, 6, 
9, and 12.  The set-top box was tuned to (virtual) channel 2 for the tests. 
The WSD transmitter’s antenna was located about four meters from the set-top 
box.  When the transmitter was energized at +22 dBm, the picture experienced occasional 
blocking, indicating “weak” interference.  When the transmitter antenna was relocated to 
a position two meters from the set-top box, the blocking became frequent, and at a 
distance of one meter, the picture froze and then disappeared.  The same severity of 
  
26 EIA Standard 542B, Channel 72 is 510–516 MHz.
27 –48 dBm + 48.75 = +0.75 dBmV for a 75? system.
28 The set top box fed HDMI the converter box and then the monitor.  
29 -56 + 48.75 = -7.25 dBmV for a 75? system.
37
interference was observed at each distance with the transmitter set to either 4.5 or 6 MHz 
transmit bandwidth.  
With the WSD transmitter’s antenna at a distance of two meters from the set-top 
box, 3 dB of attenuation was introduced between the WSD transmitter and its antenna, 
and the interference ceased.  This represents a transmitter power output of +19 dBm.  
The additional 3 dB of signal attenuation was removed and the WSD transmit 
antenna was maintained at a distance of 2 meters from the set-top box, and rotated from 
vertical to horizontal.  The severity of the interference increased when the antenna was 
rotated.  Additional attenuation of 11 dB was required to eliminate the interference, 
representing a power output of +11 dBm. 
Tentative Conclusions from Location #6 Tests
• The residence’s cable receiving system was susceptible to direct pick-up 
(DPU) interference in analog mode when the WSD transmit antenna was 
within two meters of the RF components.
• The residence’s digital cable set-top box was susceptible to interference from 
the WSD in QAM mode (analog mode not tested) at a distance of about two 
meters.
• The digital set-top box was more susceptible to interference from the WSD 
transmitter when the transmit antenna was horizontally polarized.  
4.3 Summary of Results
The results of the tests described in Section 4.1 demonstrate that a DTV receive 
system tuned to a weak DTV channel can experience interference at significant 
separation distances (data extrapolation indicates to up to 1.2 km) from the WSD 
transmitter when it is radiating a signal at ~150 mW EIRP.
With the transmitter operating at full power on a channel adjacent to a weak 
channel being received by the DTV receiver system, interference was not observed in a 
simulated rooftop-mounted receive antenna scenario.
These tests served to informally validate currently accepted D/U thresholds for 
co-channel interference (15 dB).
Direct pick-up interference to cable television reception was demonstrated at 
transmit power levels consistent with those reported in previous FCC measurement 
efforts.  The interference appears to be dependent on the configuration of the cable 
installation and whether or not a set-top box was used and if so, the susceptibility of the 
box to signal ingress.

5 TV-Sensing (Channel Occupancy) Field Tests
This section describes the field measurement component of the Phase II 
measurement effort and provides a summary of the data collected.  This component 
involved field trials performed with each of the WSD prototypes in an effort to assess 
their ability to detect incumbent television stations in “real world” environments.  
Measurements of over-the-air TV signals were also performed at each site to determine 
the occupancy of each television channel over the range 21-51.
Four of the originally submitted WSD prototypes were used for these tests.  As 
previously discussed, prior to the commencement of the field tests, Adaptrum modified 
its device to improve the detection of DTV signals with frequency offset pilot carriers.30
Unfortunately, this software patch resulted in the device taking considerably longer to 
perform a full 31-channel scan.31 This limited the number of trials that could be 
practically performed with this device at each test location.  Motorola also modified its 
device prior to the field tests to mitigate overload problems resulting from strong adjacent 
channel signals.32
Nine field sites were selected for these tests, representing a mix of urban, 
suburban and rural locales.  The sites included three private residences, an office building 
and five outdoor locations.  Table 5-1 lists these nine test sites.  More information is 
provided on a site-by-site basis in the following subsections. 
Trials of the detection capabilities of each of the WSD prototypes were performed 
from two distinct locations at each test site (the Adaptrum device was often limited to one 
full-scan trial due to time limitations).  The rationale for performing trials from two 
separate locations at each site was to attempt to avoid the possibility of testing in a signal 
null zone.  This practice also provided an opportunity to examine the consistency in the 
results between proximate locations.  Except for the Adaptrum WSD, two trials were 
performed at each of two locations, for a total of four separate trials at each site.
The WSDs were generally operated separately and sequentially in order to 
prevent spurious energy generated by one prototype from affecting the results of another 
(exceptions were at test sites 5 and 8, where an adequate distance between the WSDs 
could be achieved).  Although only four WSDs were tested, the Motorola prototype was 
tested in two configurations at each site (“normal or geolocation” and “test or sensing” 
modes), and at several sites the Philips prototype was also tested in a second 
configuration (with external attenuation added between the antenna and the receiver 
input).

At each test site, measurements were performed to determine the occupancy of 
each of the channels in the 21-51 range.  These measurements involved using the FCC 
truck, equipped with a pneumatic mast that was used to extend a consumer television 
receive antenna to a height (relative to ground level) of approximately 9.1 meters (30 
feet) in an effort to simulate a typical rooftop antenna installation.  The antenna was 
connected first to a spectrum analyzer via coaxial cable and rotated to optimize reception 
on each channel.  A spectrum analyzer was used to identify the signal type and to 
measure the associated signal power level.  For digital TV (ATSC) signals, the power 
level was measured as the integrated power over the 6-MHz channel.  For analog TV 
(NTSC) signals, the power level was measured in terms of the peak-of-sync power of the 
visual carrier.  After completing these measurements, the antenna lead was connected to 
an appropriate receiver to determine whether a “viewable” picture could be displayed.  
For those channels occupied by DTV signals, a digital-to-analog set-top box was used as 
the tuner, paired with the display portion of a digital television receiver.  For channels 
with analog signals, the antenna lead was connected directly to the TV receiver.  
Additional details regarding these on-site measurements are presented in Appendix C.
Several anecdotal interference tests were also performed as a part of these field 
measurements.  As discussed above, at sites 3 and 6, tests were performed to aid in 
40
assessing the potential for direct pick-up interference to cable television reception (see 
Section 4.2).  Additionally, anecdotal tests of the wireless microphone detection 
capability implemented in two of the prototype devices (Philips and I2R) were performed 
at test sites 3 and 5.  This data is described elsewhere in this report (see Section 6).
The following subsections describe the test sites in greater detail and present the 
information and data collected at each.  For each test site, a table is presented that 
summarizes information associated with each channel in the 21-51 range (excluding 
channel 37).  This table provides six columns of data obtained from the FCC database, 
augmented with a column of data obtained from on-site observations.  The data under 
each column header are as follows:
· CH – lists each channel from 21-51, excluding channel 37 (which is reserved for 
Radio Astronomy and in-hospital wireless medical telemetry operations).
· Station Call Sign – lists the station identifier (call sign) for each TV station 
(transmitter location) within a 100-km radius of the test site.  The 100-km radius 
was chosen because it is larger than the service areas of most analog and digital 
TV broadcast stations. 
· Station Location – lists the community associated with each licensed station.
· Signal Type – identifies whether the channel is anticipated to be occupied with an 
analog or digital television broadcast signal based on information extracted from 
the FCC consolidated database system (CDBS).
· Separation Distance – provides the distance (in kilometers) between the station’s 
broadcast antenna site and the test site location.
· Within Service Contour – identifies whether or not the test site is located within 
the calculated service contour of the associated station.
· Viewable – identifies whether or not a television signal could be demodulated and 
viewed with the test receiver set-up utilized in this effort.33 In declaring an NTSC 
channel as viewable, no consideration was given to received picture quality.
Subsequent tables are presented for each test site that provides the raw data from 
the field trials for each WSD prototype.  The unique column headings used in tables are 
described as follows:
  
33 It is noted that the test receiving system used herein varies from both the analog and digital TV planning 
factors by approximately 4.3 dB (the receive antenna used in the field tests provides 7 dBd of gain rather 
than the 10 dBd used in the planning factors and the line loss of the field test receive system was about 5.3 
dB rather than 4 dB used in the planning factors).  Therefore, the test system provided 4.3 dB less signal to 
the receiver than would a system adhering to the planning factors.
41
· Measured Signal Type – identifies whether the actual measured signal on each 
channel was digital or analog.  In general, this data was consistent with the 
anticipated signal type; however exceptions were observed.  These exceptions can 
be explained.  Often, the anticipated signal was associated with a low-power 
station located some distance from the test site.  In such cases, it is plausible that a 
full-power station located beyond 100-km will overpower the low-power station.  
Additionally, because of differences in the methodology for measuring and 
expressing analog and digital signal levels, it’s possible to measure NTSC signals 
at a lower receive carrier level than ATSC signals.  Thus, it’s often possible to 
measure an analog signal originating beyond the 100-km radius, whereas a digital 
signal originating inside, but near the edge of the radius, could not be measured.  
In most cases where a discrepancy exists between the anticipated signal type 
versus the measured signal type, it involves the detection of an analog signal 
when a digital signal was anticipated.
· Measured Power Level – This column presents the measured power level on 
each channel for each test site.  Information regarding how these measurements 
were performed is provided in Appendix C.
· Occupied (O) & Available (A) Channels Reported by Each WSD – This 
column indicates whether the WSD prototype reported the channel as occupied 
(indicated by an “O”).  The status of those channels not reported as “occupied” 
were determined based on the rationale discussed below and indicated in the table 
by either an “A” to represent available or a “-“ to represent indeterminate. This 
column may be further subdivided to indicate the results observed at each 
particular location where the device was tested.  For example, L1/S1 denotes 
those results obtained from the first scan performed at location 1 and similarly, 
L2/S2 denotes those results obtained from the second scan performed at location 
2.
All of the prototype devices, except for the Motorola device when operated in 
“Normal” (geo-location) mode, explicitly report only those channels determined to be 
occupied.  When operated in this mode, the Motorola device reports those channels 
determined to be occupied and also provides a list of the channels that it determines to be 
“available”.  
When a prototype WSD scans for both ATSC and NTSC signals (even when it 
requires separate scans to accomplish this) upon completion of a scan, those channels not 
reported as occupied can reasonably be presumed to be vacant or “available”.  However, 
if the scan is performed to detect only channels occupied with one signal type (NTSC or 
ATSC), then the status of the channels not reported as occupied is not readily apparent.  
Examples of such scans performed in the field trials were: 1) those scans performed with 
the Adaptrum prototype device for NTSC-occupied channels only, 2) those scans 
performed with the Motorola prototype device in “test” (sensing only) mode for ATSC-
occupied channels only, and 3) those scans performed with the I2R prototype device at 
42
test sites 1 and 2, where the device was operated in the incorrect mode for detecting 
ATSC-occupied channels (in effect, resulting in NTSC-only scans).  
In populating the data tables reported for each test site, the following approach 
was applied to determine the status of each channel based on the scan results:
· For all devices, those detection results indicated in the table by an “O” represent 
exactly what was reported by the device at the conclusion of each scan.
· For those devices used to perform scans for both signal types (ATSC and NTSC) 
at the same location, the detection results indicated in the table by an “A” 
represent the channels that were not reported by the device as occupied under 
scans for both signals and thus were presumed to be vacant or “available”.  This 
condition is applicable to the following devices under the described conditions:
o The Adaptrum device in those locations where both ATSC and NTSC 
scans were performed,
o The I2R device at all sites except 1 and 2,
o The Motorola device when operated in the “Normal” mode (effectively),
o The Philips device in all configurations.
· For those scans performed for only one signal type (ATSC or NTSC), 
determining whether a channel not reported as occupied would have been 
considered vacant (available) was often ambiguous and in some cases required 
that some judgment be applied.  The following criteria was applied in making 
such channel status decisions:
o If the measured over-the-air signal type anticipated via the TV contours 
matched the signal type and was of the same type as that being detected by 
the device, then a channel not reported by the device as occupied was 
presumed to be available (indicated by “A” in the tables).
o If the measured signal type was of the same type as that being detected by 
the device (i.e., the measured signal was NTSC and the device was 
scanning for an NTSC signal), then regardless of the expected signal type, 
a channel not reported by the device as occupied was presumed to be 
available (indicated by “A” in the tables).
o If the expected signal type matched the measured signal type but was of 
the opposite type from that being detected by the device (i.e., the expected 
and measured signal were ATSC but the device was scanning for NTSC), 
then no presumption was made for those channels not reported by the 
device as occupied (indicated by “-“ in the tables).
o If there was no expected signal type reported for the channel (no station 
assigned to the channel) and a signal type was not measured at the site, 
43
then no presumption was made regarding those channels not reported by 
the device as occupied (indicated in the tables by “-“).34
o For any other conditions for which ambiguity existed, no presumption was 
made regarding the channel status for those channels not reported by the 
device as occupied (indicated in the tables by “-“).
Finally, there are some entries to the table where more than one station within the 100-km 
search radius is assigned to a single channel.  In these cases, the signal type measured at 
the site took precedence when assessing channel status.
5.1 Test Site #1 – Patapsco Valley State Park, Elkridge, MD
This site offered public access (Maryland State Park) and is representative of a 
setting with difficult television reception characteristics.  The actual test site was a 
parking lot in the rear of the park, adjacent to the Patapsco river bed, in a valley with 
rapidly rising, wooded terrain to the Northeast (towards Baltimore) and Southwest 
(towards Washington).  The two test locations at this site were in the same parking lot, 
separated by approximately 45.7 meters (150 feet).
  
34 In these cases it could not be determined with certainty that a signal of the opposite type was not present 
at levels below the measurement threshold but still within the detection range of the device.

5.2 Test Site #2 - Aircraft Observation Area, Glen Burnie, MD
This is a public accessible site in the Baltimore suburbs, just south of 
BWI/Thurgood Marshall Airport, under the approach path to runway 15R/33L.  The 
channel occupancy measurements were performed from the west side of the parking lot 
and the prototype field trials were performed adjacent to the parking lot (location 1) and 
approximately 45.7 meters (150 feet) southwest of the first location (location 2).  Several 
high-power TV signals were observed at this site.

5.3 Test Site #3 – Private Residence in Ellicott City, MD
This site is a two-story single-family home on a hilltop in the suburbs of 
Baltimore, MD.  The channel occupancy measurements were performed in the driveway.  
The prototype trials were performed in the first floor living area (location 1) and a second 
floor bedroom (location 2).  Because of the hilltop location, excellent television reception 
was observed, including some stations for which the site was beyond their service 
contour.

5.5 Test Site #5 – FCC Headquarters in Washington, DC
This site is a high-rise office building in downtown southwest Washington, DC.  
Field trials of the WSD prototypes were performed in a training room on the 12th street 
level (ground floor) and in an area on the 7th floor near a window. Channel occupancy 
measurements were performed at the same locations, using a bi-conical receive antenna 
mounted on a tripod.

5.10 TV-Sensing (Channel Occupancy) Field Test Summary
This section provides a summary of the prototype TV WSD field trial results 
obtained at the nine test sites.  
In reducing the data from the TV sensing field tests it became obvious that two 
available parameters can be used to define a set of conditions which apply uniquely to 
each channel under consideration for “white” space use.  These two parameters have been 
labeled “Within Contour” and “Viewable” in this report and each has a value of either 
yes (1) or no (0).  This binary combination yields four possible conditions that will 
uniquely describe each TV channel at a particular location.  These four conditions are:
· Condition I:  the WSD is operating within the service contour of a station 
assigned to the channel and the broadcast signal can be displayed on a 
representative consumer TV receiver system (viewable).
· Condition II:  the WSD is operating within the service contour of a station 
assigned to the channel but the broadcast signal cannot be displayed on a 
representative consumer TV receiver system (not viewable).
· Condition III:  the WSD is operating outside of the service contour of a station 
assigned to the channel but the broadcast signal can be displayed on a 
representative consumer TV receiver system (viewable).
· Condition IV:  the WSD is operating outside of the service contour of a station 
assigned to the channel and the broadcast signal cannot be displayed on a 
representative consumer TV receiver system (not viewable).
Table 5-60, presented below, defines how each channel between 21 and 51 was 
categorized at each of the field trial sites.  In this table, each channel is assigned to one of 
the four conditions described above and then further segmented according to the signal 
type utilizing the channel (ATSC or NTSC).

Tables 5-61 through 5-66 provide the results from the field trials in terms of the 
ability of each WSD prototype to correctly identify Condition I, II, III or IV channels.  
For each condition, the number of correct detections is shown as a function of the number 
of scans performed.  While this approach presumes that Condition II and III channels 
represent occupied, rather than available channels, the arithmetic complement of each 
reported result defines the performance under the opposite presumption (i.e., that they 
represent available channels).

It should be noted that the reported NTSC-detection performance may be 
somewhat misleading since no consideration was given to the quality of the analog 
picture when identifying “viewable” channels. 
5.10.1 Observations Based on Results
The TV-sensing field trial results indicate that the Motorola WSD, which employs 
a geo-location/database look-up approach to identify occupied and unoccupied TV 
channels, was the best overall performer with respect to correctly determining occupied 
and unoccupied (available) TV channels within TV station service contours.  This 
prototype also employs a spectrum sensing capability that was found to perform with less 
accuracy than that of other devices. The combination of geo-location/database look up 
and spectrum sensing techniques provide an acceptable mechanism to allow for 
authorization of equipment today.
The results obtained from those WSD prototypes that rely solely on spectrum 
sensing to identify occupied and unoccupied (available) channels demonstrate the 
importance of correctly specifying a detection sensitivity requirement.  The Philips 
device, which demonstrated the most sensitivity in the laboratory tests, also performed 
best with respect to detecting occupied channels; however, it reported a very high 
percentage of channels occupied that were potentially available.  The Adaptrum and I2R 
devices, which demonstrated less sensitivity in the laboratory measurements, did much 
better at correctly determining available channels but did not detect occupied channels 
with complete reliability.  Spectrum sensing worked to some degree and it may be 
possible to authorize products that rely on spectrum sensing, in the future, if it can be 
demonstrated that they will not interfere.
The comparative received power measurements performed at each test site 
indicate that the difference in signal level between TV signals received by a roof-top 
television antenna and those received by ground-proximate antenna can vary between 0 
and 34 dB, depending on the specific site conditions and whether the WSD antenna is 
located indoors or outdoors relative to the TV antenna.

6 Wireless Microphone Measurements
6.1 Wireless Microphone Laboratory Tests
6.1.1 Introduction
The purpose of this part of the test project was to observe the capabilities of the 
current white space device (WSD) prototypes to sense Part 74 wireless microphones 
(WM) operating on broadcast television channels at known signal levels with and without 
digital television (DTV) signals on adjacent channels.  Tests were performed with two 
different types of microphones – FM modulated and digitally modulated.38 All of the 
tested microphones operate in a maximum 200 kHz authorized bandwidth segment within 
a TV channel.  Each microphone was limited to operation in a different subset of 
television channels 21 to 51; individual microphones were tested on frequencies within 
their subset as shown in the test results.  The test modulation was a 1000 Hz tone at 24 
kHz deviation.  The two FM microphones had a 32 kHz pilot tone and the digital 
microphone was encrypted.  The measured modulated signal for the FM microphones is 
shown in Figure 6-1 and the measured signal of the digital microphone, which appears 
the same with or without modulation, is shown in Figure 6-2.

The WSDs submitted by Microsoft and Philips were similar to those submitted in 
the previous round of testing (Phase I) with respect to their ability to detect wireless 
microphones with some modifications.  The changes eliminate the ability to select the 
type of signal (ATSC, NTSC or wireless microphone) to search for and the identification 
of the type of signal sensed.  The versions of both of these WSDs examined in the Phase 
II tests searched for all three types of signals on each scan of a channel and indicated only 
whether the channel was occupied or available on each scan or the probability of 
detection for the number of scans selected.  The Institute for Infocomm Research (I2R) 
device had the capability to search for either DTV or wireless microphone signals.  It 
provided two scan modes – “DTV” and “All” and two test modes – “Lab” and “Field”.  
In the DTV scan mode it searched only for DTV signals and in the “All” mode it 
searched only for microphones.  The “Lab” test mode was intended only for conducted 
bench testing and the “Field” mode was intended only for reception of radiated signals 
with an antenna.  The test results were displayed as the probability of detection for the 
number of scans selected.
118
6.1.2 Test Procedure
Because of ambient emissions, direct pick-up and spurious radiated emissions from 
the WSD systems, it was not possible to derive a clean test signal on the bench by 
sampling the radiated signal from a wireless microphone with a receive antenna and 
applying it to the antenna input connector of the WSD.  It was thus determined that the 
testing needed to be performed with the wireless microphone in an anechoic chamber.  
This approach avoided interference to the test from undesired signals, and allowed a 
sample of the radiated signal from the microphone to be received with an antenna in the 
chamber.  This received signal was then conducted by coaxial cable to the control room 
for connection to the antenna terminal of the WSD, as shown in Figure 6-3.

The WSDs were first tested for sensitivity to a wireless microphone signal at a 
low, middle and high frequency within a TV channel with no other signals present.  The 
sensitivity threshold of a WSD was defined as the lowest bandpower at which the 
microphone is detected on 10 of 10 successive scans.  Each WSD was tested with the FM 
microphone modulated and, in some cases, unmodulated.  The digital microphone was 
tested with or without modulation since there was no discernible difference between the 
modulated and unmodulated signal or in the response of the WSDs to the different 
signals.  Testing was then performed with simulated DTV signals located in various 
combinations of first and second adjacent channels over a range of power levels.  The 
simulated DTV signal was obtained from a Rohde& Schwarz SFU signal generator.  The 
spectral characteristics of the simulated DTV signal with the emissions mask specified in 
Section 73.622(h) of the Commission’s rules are shown in Figure 6.4.

6.1.3 Test Results with Microphones and No DTV Signals
The sensitivity of the WSDs with no other signals present is shown in tables 6-1 
through 6-9.  In most cases the FM wireless microphones were tested at 50 kHz above the 
low frequency edge of the channel, in the middle of the channel and 50 kHz below the 
high edge of the channel and, because of its wider occupied bandwidth, the digital 
microphone was tested 100 kHz above the low edge of the channel, in the middle of the 
channel and 100 kHz below the high edge of the channel.  It was not always possible or 
considered necessary to test at all three frequencies within a channel.  The Shure UR1 H4 
is the same basic model as the UR1 L3 tuned to a different frequency range.

6.1.4 Test Results with Microphones and DTV Signals
The WSDs were tested to determine their ability to sense a wireless microphone 
on a channel and with simulated DTV signals on various combinations of first and second 
adjacent channels.  The DTV signals were provided at power levels -28, -53, -68 and -84 
dBm, which represent a high, medium, low and very low signal level.  In most cases, it 
was found that at DTV power levels of -68 dBm or higher, the WSDs would indicate that 
the wireless microphone channel was occupied when no microphone signal was present 
(false positive) and the Microsoft WSD would not sense a wireless microphone signal at 
-80 dBm when the DTV signal power was -28 dBm.  In a few cases when the DTV signal 
was on the lower adjacent channel, the WSDs would only indicate a false positive if the 
DTV power was increased to a power level of -53 dBm or higher.  Because of test

6.1.5 Summary
All of the WSDs gave false positive indications of microphone detection with 
DTV signal levels as low as -68 dBm in adjacent channels.  The Microsoft device also 
gave false negative indications with a DTV signal level of -28 dBm in adjacent channels 
and a microphone power of -80 dBm.  The presence of DTV signals had little effect on 
the sensitivity of the devices to the Lectrosonics microphone but there was insufficient 
data to determine the effect of DTV signals on the sensitivity of the Microsoft device to 
the Shure microphone.  The sensitivity of the Philips device to a modulated Shure 
microphone signal was not significantly affected by the presence of DTV signals.  
However, when the Shure microphone signal was unmodulated, the Philips device was 
significantly less sensitive to a microphone in the middle of the TV channel with or 
without DTV signals in adjacent channels.

6.2 Wireless Microphone Field Tests 
6.2.1 Introduction
Field tests were conducted to evaluate the performance of the WSDs in detecting 
wireless microphones under real-world conditions.  Arrangements were made with the 
National Football League (NFL) and the ESPN Network (ESPN) to perform tests before 
and during a pre-season football game at FedEx Field in Landover, MD and with the 
Majestic Theatre in New York City to perform tests before and during a performance of a 
Broadway play.
ESPN offered to simulate a game day broadcast at FedEx Field from 10:30 AM in 
the morning until 5:00 PM in the afternoon before the start of the game.  During this time 
they would turn all their wireless microphones on or off upon request.  The WSDs were 
operated and spectrum measurements were taken at four different locations at the venue: 
on the east (home field) side of the playing field from 10:30 AM to 12:00 PM, at the 
“tailgate” area outside the stadium from 12:40 PM to 2:00 PM, on the upper deck from 
2:20 PM to 3:30 PM, and in the Press Box from 4:00 PM on.  At 5:00 PM, ESPN was 
required to cease transmissions so the NFL could set up and test their wireless 
microphones for use during the game, which began at 7:00 PM.  From 6:20 PM to 7:00 
PM during pre-game activities and from 7:20 PM to 7:45 PM during the first quarter of 
the game, the WSDs were operated and spectrum measurements taken.
At the Majestic Theatre, WSD tests and spectrum measurements were taken at 
three different locations before the performance: on the sidewalk at the entrance to the 
theater, in the middle of the mezzanine and in the orchestra seating area.  Measurements 
were also taken at one location during the performance (entrance ramp to the orchestra 
seating area).  Before the performance, measurements were performed with the wireless 
microphones to be used during the show turned on and off upon request.
6.2.2 Test Procedure
At each location the Philips and I2R WSDs were set up with their receive 
antennas located approximately 2 meters from the wireless microphone base unit.  The 
frequency spectrum was scanned by the WSDs from TV channels 21 to 51 with the 
wireless microphones turned on and off.  The channels indicated as occupied by the WSD 
were recorded in each case.  The frequency spectrum was also observed and recorded 
with a spectrum analyzer using a ground plane vertical antenna with a gain of 
approximately 0 dBi from channels 21 to 51. 
6.2.3 Test Results
Tables 6-29 through 6-48 show the results of the WSD scans.  “X” indicates the 
channels on which ESPN, the NFL or the Majestic Theatre were operating wireless 
microphones and the channels which the WSDs reported as occupied with the 
microphones off and on.  The channels indicated as NFL channels are those on which it 
appears that there were NFL microphones based on the spectrum scans.  The spectrum 
plots obtained with the spectrum analyzer under the same conditions are given in 
Appendix A for FedEx Field and Appendix B for the Majestic Theatre.
131
Additionally, during two of the field tests of the of the white space devices’ 
ability to detect TV signals, brief tests were conducted to check the ability of the Philips 
and the I2R devices to detect wireless microphones.  At the Portals location, it was found 
that the Philips device could detect the Shure UR1 and the Lectrosonics UM 700 
microphones at distances up to 30.5 meters (100 feet) within the building with 
intervening walls.  The I2R device reported detection of the Shure UR1 with less than 
100% probability at 4.6 meters (15 feet) or less but could not detect the microphone at 
30.5 meters (100 feet).  The I2R device reported detection of the Lectrosonics unit with 
100 % probability at distances up to 6.1 meters (20 feet) but with only 60% probability at 
distances of 30.5 meters (100 feet) and 61 meters (200 feet).  At the #3 test site, a 
residential location, the Philips device could not be tested because it indicated that all 
channels were occupied.  At this location, the I2R device could not detect the Shure UR2 
even as close as 1.5 meters (5 feet) but it could detect the Lectrosonics UM 700 at 
distances up to 15.2 meters (50 feet) where the reported probability of detection 
decreased to 50%.

6.2.4 Summary
Wireless microphone sensing tests were performed with the I2R and Philips devices at 2 
locations.  The tests were conducted first with microphones off, and then turned on, in 
pre-determined channels to determine if the devices could sense the presence of wireless 
microphones.  At both sites and all the test locations, the Philips device reported all the 
channels on which the microphones were designated to transmit as occupied whether the 
microphone was transmitting or not.  The I2R device indicated several channels as 
available even when the microphones were on.
