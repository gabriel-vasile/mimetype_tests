By the Chief, Common Carrier Bureau:

                              I. INTRODUCTION

       1.      Alameda Engineering, Inc. (Alameda), an equipment manufacturer, seeks a
waiver of Section 68.312(k) of the Commission's rules to offer a device that detects the
presence of a "stutter dial tone."  Bejed, Inc., Ektel, Cidco, Inc., Cleveland Associates,
VoiceWaves, Inc., Phone Labs Technology Company, Inc. and Technology Arts, Inc. also
filed requests for waiver of Section 68.312(k) for devices similar to Alameda's after
Alameda's request was placed on Public Notice.  A "stutter dial tone" is a series of short
separate tones produced by the telephone company's central switching office that alerts a
voice mail subscriber that he or she has voice mail.  Alameda's device automatically detects
the presence of stutter dial tone and causes a light to blink to visually alert the subscriber of
the waiting voice mail message.  Generally, the petitioners ask the Commission to waive the
rule requiring that registered telephone equipment shall not take a telephone line off-hook at
any time except to place or receive telephone calls, so that the stutter dial tone detection
device may be registered and connected to the public switched telephone network.  In this
Order, we grant the waiver requests of Alameda, Bejed, Inc., Ektel, Cidco, Inc., Cleveland
Associates, VoiceWaves, Inc., Phone Labs Technology Company, Inc. and Technology Arts,
Inc., subject to conditions.

                     II. BACKGROUND AND THE PETITIONS

       2.      Part 68 of the Commission's rules provides the technical and procedural
standards under which customer-provided telephone equipment, systems and protective
apparatus may be directly connected to the public switched telephone network.  Compliance
with those standards assures equipment manufacturers and consumers that their equipment can
be connected to the network, and assures telephone companies that connection of that
equipment will not cause harm to the network.  Local exchange carriers' (LECs) central office
switches provide a dial tone to customers when they take their phone off-hook.  The switches
are capable of responding to a certain demand for dial tone at any given time based on the
calling patterns of the LECs' customers.  Section 68.312(k) of the Commission's rules states
that telephone equipment may only take a telephone line off-hook to receive a dial tone for
the purposes of requesting service, answering an incoming call, or programming repertory dialers.

       3.      Alameda requests a waiver of Section 68.312(k) to register a device that takes a
telephone line off-hook to detect the presence of a stutter dial tone.  The stutter dial tone is
produced by the telephone company's central office when messages are waiting for a
subscriber to the LEC's voice mail service, in order to alert the subscriber that he or she has
voice mail.  Currently, voice mail subscribers can manually take their phone off-hook and
listen for the presence of a stutter dial tone to determine if they have voice mail.  The device
at issue in this Order automatically takes the telephone off-hook, and, if it detects stutter dial
tone, visually alerts the called party of voice mail's presence by illuminating a light on the
device.  The waiver request specifies that the device will take the line off-hook to check for
stutter dial tone in three instances:  (1) after the telephone has been used to make or receive a
call; (2) 2 to 3 minutes after the telephone rings and is not answered; and (3) automatically
every 15 minutes to make "periodic" checks for transfers of messages that did not cause the
telephone to ring.  In its modified waiver request, Alameda states that several public interest
benefits will flow from granting a waiver for its device.  Central office voice mail subscribers
will benefit from the convenience and increased reliability of receiving important messages by
not having to lift the telephone receiver repeatedly to check for messages.  Service providers
will also benefit by having prior knowledge of the exact load on their central office
equipment caused by each new voice mail subscriber.  Additionally, service providers will be
assured that off-hook checks are made in an efficient manner.

       4.      Seven other parties have filed requests for waiver of Section 68.312(k) of the
Commission's Rules for stutter dial tone detection and visual indicating devices similar to
Alameda's.  Bejed and Ektel filed before the comment period for Alameda's waiver request
closed, while Cleveland, Cidco, VoiceWaves, Phone Labs and Technology Arts filed after the
comment period closed.  Bejed supports the petition filed by Alameda and indicates that it has
developed a product similar to Alameda's.  Bejed states that its device does not draw power
from the telephone line while the line is on-hook, and that the frequency of off-hook checks
performed by its device can be adjusted according to the requirements of the customer or
operating company.  Bejed also asserts that its device greatly improves the usefulness of
voice mail services and benefits the telephone industry. 

       5.      Ektel believes stutter dial tone detection devices comply with Section
68.312(k), but requests a waiver for its device.  Its device is similar to Alameda's in that it
performs off-hook checks for stutter dial tone after an unanswered call, after the customer
places a call and hangs up, and also performs periodic checks.  In its reply, Ektel suggests
that its device be subject to the following constraints:  (1) the device limits stutter test time to
no more than 4 seconds; (2) it conducts no more than two tests for each outbound call or
unanswered incoming call; (3) it conducts no test when the message indicator is illuminated;
and (4) it either performs periodic checks every 4 hours or, in the alternative, does not
perform periodic checks, if the Commission considers periodic checking harmful to network
integrity.  Ektel also states that multiple devices attached to extensions of the same line
should synchronize their test activity to ensure that the total number of times the line is taken
off-hook by the several devices in parallel will be identical to the number of times the line
would be taken off-hook by a single device. 

       6.      Cidco indicates that it did not file timely comments in this proceeding because
it did not become aware of Alameda's waiver request until after the record closed.  Cidco
seeks a waiver of Section 68.312(k) for its device, which checks for stutter dial tone only: 
(1) thirteen seconds after any phone on the customer's line taken off-hook for over 5 seconds
is then returned on-hook; and (2) ten minutes and 13 seconds after an unanswered ring. 
Cidco asserts that its device, which performs no periodic checking, addresses LEC concerns
by minimizing the traffic and switching burden it imposes on their switches.  Cidco's device
remains off-hook for three seconds when checking for stutter dial tone, and is powered by an
Alternating Current (AC) adapter.  Cleveland requests waiver for a device that it asserts
takes the line off-hook the minimum amount necessary to detect all messages that have been
left in a subscriber's voice mail:  (1) several seconds after an unanswered call; (2) several
seconds after a customer completes a call and places the line back on-hook; and (3) a second
time several minutes after either of the above in case a lengthy message was left and was not
detected by the first check.  Its device performs no periodic checks so as to avoid
unnecessarily burdening central office switches.

       7.      VoiceWaves maintains that its device is designed to use less switching capacity
than a person, and asserts that any device granted a waiver should not create a significant load
on the network.  VoiceWaves also suggests the following criteria for determining eligibility
for a waiver, all of which its device meets:  (1) off-hook checks should be made after an
unanswered call or two minutes or longer after the call is completed; (2) off-hook checks
made after the unanswered call or completed call should not occur when a message is already
present and the message light is illuminated; (3) off-hook checks should last at least 3 seconds
to comprehend all types of PBXs; (4) the device should not interfere with the operation of
other equipment, such as faxes or modems, on the same telephone line, nor should other
equipment interfere with the stutter detection device; and (5) AC powered devices should not
be permitted, and with line power required for all devices.

       8.      Phone Labs asserts that preserving the integrity of the telephone network is
paramount in the design of its stutter dial tone detection device.  Its device checks for stutter
dial tone in four cases:  (1) five seconds after connection of the device to the telephone line;
(2) five minutes after an unanswered call; (3) five seconds and again five minutes after the
phone is taken off-hook by a caller to place a call for longer than 10 seconds; and (4) every
two hours after the last occurrence of any of the above three events in order to turn out the
light if a message was retrieved remotely.  Finally, Technology Arts requests a waiver of
Section 68.312(k) for a device that checks for stutter dial tone at 15 minutes intervals and 60
seconds after a completed or unanswered call, and leaves a visual signal when a message is in
the subscriber's voice mailbox.  Technology Arts states that modifications to its device can
be made quickly and easily to conform with requirements for waiver.


                      III. POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES  

       9.      Eight parties oppose Alameda's waiver request, primarily arguing that
Alameda's device will harm the network.  While these parties generally acknowledge the
benefits that a device like Alameda's could bring to central office-based voice mail services
offered by the LECs, several parties claim that placing customers' lines off-hook every 15
minutes to check for automatic transfers of messages that did not cause the telephone to ring,
as Alameda proposes, would significantly increase the load on available switch capacity. 
For example, US West estimates that polling every fifteen minutes over 20,000 lines would
take up over 7 percent of the capacity of a DMS-100 processor and 5 percent of a 1AESS
processor.  Alameda states that its device probably takes the line off-hook less frequently
than a subscriber might manually check for messages.  TIA disputes this claim, asserting
that users are often absent from their telephones and thus do not manually check for long
periods of time.  TIA further maintains that a large number of stutter dial tone indicators
attached to the telephone network could cause dialing delay in the same way that radio station
broadcasts of contest call-in numbers have congested the telephone network by generating an
unusually high volume of calls.  For this reason, four commenters urge the Commission to
dismiss Alameda's request until the impact of placing a large number of such devices in
service can be fully analyzed.
 
       10.     US West states Alameda's waiver should be denied and a rulemaking begun to
address broad principles to govern use of the telephone line as a power source and use of dial
tone for purposes other than indicating to consumers that their telephone is prepared to
transmit a telephone call.  In the alternative, US West conditionally supports the waiver
provided that the following conditions are met:  (1) that the device uses a power source other
than the telephone line; and (2) that the device be required to stop taking the line off-hook
when the message light is activated.

       11.     SNI Innovation supports Alameda's waiver request with one condition:  that the
Commission should allow stutter dial tone detection only where CLASS-based voice mail is
not offered.  With CLASS, when a message is left in a subscriber's voice mail, the central
office detects it and sends a signal lighting the message light without taking the line off-hook,
but the subscriber's central office must have the necessary equipment to provide CLASS
services for this to occur.  SNI agrees with Alameda that stutter dial tone detection is needed
in those locations where Bell Operating Companies and smaller telephone companies do not
provide this CLASS-based method of indicating a message.  SNI argues, however, that in
order to ensure their voice mail services will be compatible with all telephones, telephone
service providers will continue to provide stutter dial tone to their voice mail subscribers even
where those providers also offer CLASS-based voice mail.  SNI argues, therefore, that
granting Alameda's request for waiver without prohibiting stutter dial tone detection in
CLASS service areas would be a "powerful disincentive" for telephone companies to use
CLASS and for manufacturers to develop CLASS products.  SNI states that the technology
exists to build a device with stutter dial tone detection capabilities similar to Alameda's
device, but that disconnects all stutter dial tone checks if it detects the presence of CLASS on
the line.  Alameda asserts that it originally thought CLASS message waiting indication
would have a major market and had developed a product for that market, but that service
providers indicated "overwhelmingly" that there would not be demand for such a service.

       12.     Five parties support Alameda's waiver request.  United and Central, for
example, claim that the Alameda device will not significantly increase the load on available
switch capacity at the telephone carriers' central offices and urge the Commission to grant the
waiver.  Manufacturers of devices similar to Alameda's claim that the public would benefit
from the kind of device Alameda seeks to register.  For example, VoiceWaves argues that
visual signalling devices increase the convenience of voice mail to consumers, and that such
devices provide consumers with an inexpensive alternative to having to purchase a new phone
with a message light feature.  Rummel Engineering Consulting (REC) argues that it is in the
public interest to allow visual message indicators because many subscribers find the need to
check for stutter dial tone impractical.  REC asserts that confusion regarding stutter dial tone
also causes mistaken repair requests from subscribers believing something is wrong with their
telephone line.  REC maintains that visual notification enhances voice messaging thereby
increasing its popularity, which will encourage faster and greater service innovation and
therefore "is keeping the public's best interest in mind."  Nexus Applied Research, Inc.
(Nexus) and Bejed, Inc. assert that "polling" intervals for automatic detection of stutter dial
tone can be adjusted to prevent overburdening the capacity of central office switches to handle
all calls routed through them.  Ektel, another manufacturer of an Alameda-type device,
argues that the total number of times such a device will take telephone lines off-hook to check
for stutter dial tone will be less than the total number of times the average subscriber who
does not have such a device will manually take the line off-hook to check for messages.  In
its reply, Ektel agrees that frequent polling will absorb switch resources.

       13.     Two manufacturers contend that a waiver of Section 68.312(k) is not necessary
because the rule, in allowing terminal equipment to leave the on-hook state to "request
service," encompasses checking for stutter dial tone.  Ektel asserts that stutter dial tone
detection devices comply with Section 68.312(k) of the Commission's Rules because
provision by the telephone company of stutter dial tone is a service, stutter dial tone detection
is a request for service, and its device simply automates the access to this service by
simulating the reasonable behavior of a human telephone user.  

       14.     In its reply, Alameda asserts that attachment of its device to the network will
not dramatically increase the load on available central office switch capacity.  According to
Alameda's own calculations, the increase in switch processor load will be, on average, only
1% to 2%.  Higher estimates, it says, are based on the erroneous assumption that every
subscriber on a 20,000 line switch would have an Alameda device.  Higher estimates,
according to Alameda, also fail to take into account the number of automatic periodic checks
that would be eliminated because if telephones are in use when a check is to be made, the
check will be cancelled.  Alameda further argues that it is unlikely that a large number of
the devices will check dial tone at exactly the same time, thus reducing the drain on the switch.
  
       15.     When a subscriber calls to check for messages from a remote location and
retrieves and erases those messages, the light will not extinguish until the device checks for
stutter dial tone and hears none.  Therefore, according to Alameda, its device must continue to
perform periodic checks for messages even when the indicator light is illuminated.  Alameda
also maintains that periodic checking is necessary to indicate receipt of transferred messages
that do not cause the telephone to ring.  Additionally, Alameda states that its device will not
compromise the availability of dial tone because it will immediately remove itself from the
line if a subscriber attempts to initiate a call during the period when the line is off-hook for a
stutter dial tone check.

       16.     Nevertheless, Alameda in its reply modifies its waiver request in partial
response to the objections raised by commenters.  It revises its waiver to specify that:  (1) the
seller of its device will retain necessary information on purchasers of its devices to notify
purchasers in the event that the FCC orders disconnection and will provide information to
telephone subscribers who purchase Alameda's device to inform them of this possibility; (2)
the device will be subject to a 2.1 second limit on off-hook time, instead of a limit of less
than 2 seconds as originally proposed; and, (3) the device will take the line off-hook only to
check for pulse dial tone once from 4 to 30 seconds after the subscriber completes a call, once
within 4 minutes after an incoming call is not answered, and once every hour if a check has
not otherwise occurred after a completed or unanswered call within the previous hour, instead
of once every 15 minutes as originally proposed.

       17.     Alameda further agrees that it will not allow its device to consume more than 8
microamperes of direct current from the loop, except for the purpose of drawing sufficient
loop current to cause the telephone line to go off-hook.  Moreover, if the Commission deems
it necessary, Alameda will, whenever the indicator light is already illuminated, prevent the
check normally occurring after an unanswered incoming call, provided that such checks are
allowed to occur as late as 4 minutes after the arrival of the unanswered calls.  Alameda,
however, asserts that automatic periodic checks, as well as checks made after a telephone user
hangs up upon completing a telephone conversation, should be permitted even when the
indicator is lit so that extinguishing the indicator can be handled automatically if messages
have been erased.

                              IV. DISCUSSION

A.  Part 68 and the meaning of "request service"

       18.     We find that before Alameda and other manufacturers can register their devices
they must obtain a waiver of Section 68.312(k) of the Commission's rules.  We are not
persuaded by the claims of some manufacturers that because the rule, in allowing terminal
equipment to leave the on-hook state to "request service" encompasses checking for stutter
dial tone, a waiver of Section 68.312(k) is not necessary.  The phrase "request service"
appears in Section 68.312(k), which was adopted before the introduction of central office
based voice mail.  The terms are not defined in the Report and Order, but they are used in
apposition to the phrase "or answer of an incoming call," indicating that an automated off-
hook condition is permissible only for placing and answering calls.

       19.     Moreover, LEC switches are currently designed to accommodate their
customer's calling patterns.  Should terminal equipment introduce a demand for dial tone
greater than the demand created by customers' normal calling patterns, the ability of all
telephone users to place calls could be adversely affected.  We agree with TIA that a
sufficient number of stutter dial tone indicators could introduce a demand for dial tone
sufficient to clog the switch similar to that mass calling events broadcast by radio stations
have been known to cause.  Therefore, we conclude that the phrase "request service" in
Section 68.312(k) was not intended to encompass stutter dial tone checks, and thus that
Alameda must receive a waiver of the rule before its device can be registered.

B.  Waiver Request

       20.     Pursuant to Section 1.3 of the Commission's Rules, the Commission may waive
any provision of its rules, in whole or in part, on its own motion or on petition if good cause
for a waiver is shown.  An applicant for waiver must demonstrate that special circumstances
warrant a deviation from the general rule and how such deviation will serve the public
interest.  We believe that Alameda and the other manufacturers have met this burden.

       21.     Alameda's modified proposal.  A central purpose of the Commission's Part 68
rules is to protect the telephone network from harm caused by the connection of terminal
equipment.  The potential harm that Part 68 rules are designed to prevent may include damage
to telephone company equipment and degraded quality of service to other persons using the
network.  The record in this proceeding raises questions about the risk of network harm that
may result from the connection of an Alameda-type device.  As Alameda acknowledges, the
party requesting waiver must demonstrate that no harm will come to the network through
attachment of equipment for which waiver of Part 68 is sought.  Alameda asserts that it has
resolved the most serious questions raised by commenters by modifying the specifications for
its equipment.  
       22.     We conclude that Alameda's proposal, as modified in its reply comments,
assures us that other users of the network will not be substantially affected by Alameda's
stutter dial tone detection device.  For example, Alameda proposes a 2.1 second limit per off-
hook check and a limit of one off-hook check after an unanswered call or after a subscriber
makes or receives a call and goes back on-hook.  These modifications will attenuate the
burden Alameda's device could cause to the network.  Additionally, Alameda's modified
proposal appears to ensure that too much power will not be drawn from the telephone line
when the line is taken off-hook for stutter dial tone checks, and that dial tone will be
available to a subscriber attempting to initiate a call at the same moment the stutter dial tone
detection device takes the line off-hook for a check.  

       23.     As noted by the commenting parties, the most significant threat that the stutter
dial tone detection device poses to the network is the device's potential to overburden carrier
switches by significantly adding to the number of times the switches must provide dial tone. 
A device that minimizes the number and duration of off-hook checks would therefore address
the most important concerns of commenters and the Commission.  The utility of stutter
detection devices is high and, as noted above, potentially harmful specifications can be
removed or revised without eliminating the usefulness of the device.  We recognize that to be
of utility to consumers, a device must be capable of checking for stutter dial tone after an
unanswered call, because this is when callers most often leave a voice mail message. 
Similarly, voice mail will pick up when the subscriber is using the telephone to make a call,
and a useful device would therefore make an off-hook check after a telephone subscriber
hangs up from the call.

       24.     The introduction of innovative customer premises equipment that increases
choice for consumers and improves the value to the customer of a particular service is in the
public interest.  The record indicates that a stutter dial tone indicator that does not pose harm
to the network can be developed.  Indeed, several of the modifications Alameda proposed in
its reply address the concerns raised in the record.  Those concerns not adequately addressed
by Alameda were addressed by other parties of record and can be incorporated by Alameda.

       25.     We conclude that Alameda has shown good cause for deviating from the rule
and that allowing registration for its stutter dial tone detection device would be in the public
interest.  We therefore grant Alameda's request for waiver of Section 68.312(k) to register its
stutter dial tone detection device, subject to the conditions set forth below.  We agree that
there may be significant consumer demand for an Alameda-type device.  We reject SNI's
argument that Alameda's waiver should be granted on the condition that it does not perform
stutter dial tone checks in CLASS service areas.  CLASS-based visual message systems are
not presently offered in some areas.  We find that the question of whether CLASS or stutter
dial tone detection should be used to indicate voice mail messages is a decision that market
forces should decide.  Our primary concern in considering these waiver requests is that stutter
dial tone detection devices not harm the public switched telephone network.  There is no
demonstration that the public network would be harmed if waivers were granted for stutter
dial tone detection devices without the condition suggested by SNI.

       26.     Periodic checks.  Some concerns remain even after Alameda's modified
proposal.  First, Alameda does not fully address the possibility of service degradation to third
parties caused by overburdening carrier switches.  Several LECs contend that switches
designed for normal calling patterns may be overburdened by attachment to the network of
many Alameda-type devices performing periodic checks.  We agree that periodic testing could
contribute to significant overburdening of the network.  In response to this concern, Alameda
has modified its device's specifications to make periodic checks only once per hour as
opposed to once every fifteen minutes as originally proposed.  

       27.     We also disagree with Alameda's argument that even if it performs periodic
checks, the Alameda device takes the line off-hook less frequently than a subscriber might
manually check for messages.  If periodic checks were made once per hour, each device
would take a line off-hook up to 24 times per day, which, if many of the devices were in use,
could add thousands of off-hook events to the normal calling patterns that carriers anticipate. 
Therefore, Alameda has not mitigated our concern that a device which performs any periodic
checks, even once per hour, will pose harm to the network.  Alameda asserts that a device
with periodic checking would not only greatly benefit consumers, but also service providers
by allowing them to have prior knowledge of the exact load on their switches caused by each
new subscriber.  Assuming Alameda's supposition concerning knowledge of loading is
correct, Alameda has still not demonstrated that such benefits would outweigh the potential
harm that periodic checking could cause the network.  Thus, we find that the benefit to
individual consumers does not outweigh the potential harm to the network posed by the
device making hourly checks of consumers lines.     

       28.     Based on the record before us, the utility of periodic checks appears to be
minimal relative to the their potential for causing harm to the network.  At worst, the message
light would not be illuminated when a message is transferred from another voice mail user or
would not be extinguished when a subscriber calls the voice mail from a remote location and
erases messages.  Following any subsequent unanswered call, however, the device would
check for stutter dial tone and illuminate or extinguish the message indicator accordingly. 
Additionally, there appears to be no compelling reason for performing stutter dial tone checks
after an unanswered incoming call when the message light is already illuminated.  Therefore,
a stutter detection device that does not perform periodic checks or checks after an unanswered
incoming call when the message light is already illuminated would avoid burdening the
network.  Similarly, a device that keeps the line off-hook for as short a period as possible
when performing periodic checks would minimize overburdening the network.  We therefore
conclude that a waiver must be conditioned on the above specifications.

       29.     We note that Ektel suggests that the Alameda-type device could be modified to
eliminate all periodic checks, as well as stutter dial tone checks when the visual message
indicator is already lit.  Other parties requesting waiver indicate that their devices do not
perform periodic checks because such checks are unnecessary and pose a threat to the
network.  Elimination of these checks would address the most serious problems identified by
several parties in this proceeding without reducing significantly the benefit to consumers of an
Alameda-type device.  We find that stutter detection and visual signaling devices that do not
go off-hook after an unanswered incoming call when the message light is already illuminated
and that do not perform periodic checks would not harm the network.

       30.     Our decision to grant a waiver only for stutter dial tone detection devices that
do not perform periodic checks is based on the information in the record before us.  As
discussed above, that information is not sufficiently clear to persuade us that no harm will
come to the telephone network if we were to permit attachment to the network of devices that
perform periodic checks.  Nevertheless, we are cognizant of several parties' wishes to market
devices that perform periodic checking.  We encourage parties, therefore, to monitor stutter
dial tone devices' load on carrier equipment and to gather further information that might be
relevant to the potential impact of periodic checks on carrier switch load.  We would be
specifically interested in data that would indicate the effect of infrequent periodic checks.  For
example, would a device that performs periodic checks every one or two hours cause harm to
the network?  Based on such updated information, parties may in the future wish to apply for
a Part 68 waiver for a stutter dial tone detection device that performs such periodic checks.    

           
       31.     Several devices attached to the same telephone line.  Alameda's modified
proposal does not address the cumulative effect that several stutter detection devices attached
to different extensions of the same line might have on the network.  For example, many
residences have only one telephone line but have more than one telephone.  If each telephone
in a residence has a stutter dial tone device attached to it, every device could potentially
perform an off-hook check after a completed or unanswered telephone call.  Ektel suggests
that when more than one of its stutter detection devices are attached to different extensions on
the same line, the devices are able to make the off-hook checks simultaneously.  Thus, the
total number of times the line is taken off-hook by the several devices in parallel on the same
line will be identical to the number of times the line would be taken off-hook by a single
device.  We find that the network would not be overburdened from attachment of multiple
stutter detection devices to a single line only if those devices permit synchronization of off-
hook activity when they are attached to a single telephone line.  Alameda did not address this
issue.  We condition the grant of a waiver to Alameda upon its ensuring that multiple
Alameda devices attached to extensions of the same line synchronize their off-hook checks.

       32.     Conditions.  We find that several of Alameda's modified proposed
specifications should reduce any harm to the public switched telephone network posed by
connections of Alameda's equipment to a subscriber's line.  For example, Alameda proposes a
2.1 second limit per off-hook check, and a limit of one off-hook check within 4 minutes after
an unanswered call or between 4 and 30 seconds after a subscriber ends a call.  Under
Alameda's modified proposal, its stutter detection device would not use more than 8 micro-
amps of direct current (DC) from subscriber line loop, except to cause loop DC sufficient to
make authorized off-hook checks.  This condition is consistent with the Commission's Rules
and should ensure that too much power will not be drawn from the telephone line when the
line is taken off-hook for stutter dial tone checks.  Furthermore, Alameda assures in its
modified proposal that its device does not interfere in any way or at any time with subscriber
attempts to place a telephone call.  Therefore, dial tone will be available to a subscriber
attempting to initiate a call at the same moment her stutter dial tone detection device takes the
line off-hook for a check.  We will grant Alameda's waiver request subject to Alameda's
making all the modifications it proposed in its reply comments and also subject to the
following conditions.

                               V. CONCLUSION

       33.     For the reasons set forth above, we grant Alameda's request for waiver of
Section 68.312(k) of the Commission's rules to permit connection to the public switched
network of a stutter detection and visual signaling device subject to the following particular
specifications and conditions:  that the device (1) performs no periodic testing for stutter dial
tone; (2) makes an off-hook stutter dial tone check no more than once after a subscriber
completes a call, and completes the check no earlier than 4 seconds and no later than 30
seconds after the subscriber hangs-up; (3) makes an off-hook stutter dial tone check after an
unanswered incoming call no more than once and does so within 4 minutes after the call; (4)
performs no off-hook stutter dial tone checks after an unanswered incoming call if the visual
message indicator is already lit; (5) takes the line off-hook for no more than 2.1 seconds per
stutter dial tone check; (6) synchronizes off-hook checks when multiple stutter dial tone
detection and visual signalling devices are attached to the same line so that only one check is
made per calling event for a single line; (7) does not block dial tone to a subscriber
attempting to initiate a call as an off-hook stutter dial tone detection check is occurring; and,
(8) does not use more than 8 micro-amps of direct current (DC) from subscriber line loop,
except that the device may draw loop DC sufficient to make authorized off-hook checks. 
These conditions are based on record evidence showing that visual message indicators can be
designed to these specifications.  We conclude that allowing attachment to the public
telephone network of a stutter dial tone detection device with these specifications will serve
the public interest and will pose little threat to the network.

       34.     We also conclude that waivers of Section 68.312(k) should be given to Bejed,
Inc., Ektel, Cidco, Inc., Cleveland Associates, VoiceWaves, Inc. and Phone Labs Technology
Company, Inc., subject to the same specifications, conditions and limitations as Alameda. 
Thus, these manufacturers will be permitted to register their CPE designed to detect and
indicate visually the presence of a stutter dial tone signal.  We reach this conclusion because
the devices of each of these manufacturers are similar to the device manufactured by Alameda
and we believe that the public interest would be best served by granting these requests
without further delay.  We are confident that the concerns and issues raised by these waiver
requests are similar to those that have been discussed above with respect to Alameda's
petition.

  
                           VI. ORDERING CLAUSES

       35.     Accordingly, pursuant to authority delegated in Section 0.91, 47 C.F.R.  0.91,
Section 0.291 of the Commission's Rules, 47 C.F.R.  0.291, and Section 1.3 of the
Commission's Rules, 47 C.F.R.  1.3, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, that the requests for
waiver of Section 68.312(k) of the Commission's Rules and Regulations, 47 C.F.R. 
68.312(k), by Alameda, Bejed, Ektel, Cidco, Cleveland Associates, VoiceWaves, Phone Labs
and Technology Arts ARE GRANTED to the extent discussed herein and otherwise DENIED.








       36.     IT IS FURTHER ORDERED, that the petitions for waiver are granted
SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS:    The stutter dial tone detection device
(1) performs no periodic testing for stutter dial tone; (2) makes an off-hook stutter dial tone
check no more than once after a subscriber completes a call, and completes the check no
earlier than 4 seconds and no later than 30 seconds after the subscriber hangs-up; (3) makes
an off-hook stutter dial tone check after an unanswered call no more than once and does so
within 4 minutes after the call; (4) performs no off-hook stutter dial tone checks after an
unanswered incoming call if the visual message indicator is already lit; (5) takes the line off-
hook for no more than 2.1 seconds per stutter dial tone check; (6) synchronizes off-hook
checks when multiple stutter dial tone detection and visual signalling devices are attached to
the same line so that only one check is made per calling event for a single line; (7) does not
block dial tone to a subscriber attempting to initiate a call as an off-hook stutter dial tone
detection check is occurring; and, (8) does not use more than 8 micro-amps of direct current
(DC) from subscriber line loop, except that the device may draw loop DC sufficient to make
authorized off-hook checks.
