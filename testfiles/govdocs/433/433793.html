<td>&nbsp;On Sunday evening in Afghanistan, the United States and Great
Britain launched an important phase of our military effort to rid the world
of terrorism.&nbsp; I completely support this effort, and I stand ready
as a Member of the House Armed Services Committee to aid the effort in
any way necessary.
<p>&nbsp;As President Bush stated in his Address to the Joint Session of
Congress last month, our objective is to eliminate terrorism as a force
in the world.&nbsp; To achieve this goal, we must: (1) destroy those who
have committed or aided and abetted acts of terrorism; (2) force those
who have facilitated terrorism to choose between survival if they cease
their support of terrorism and destruction if they choose to continue those
practices and (3) reward nations that resist terrorism and punish those
nations that support it.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;The campaign phase which began on Sunday is designed to advance
both the first and second goals.&nbsp; Our air strikes are designed to
clear the way for decisive ground actions that will result in the destruction
of Osama bin Laden and his forces.&nbsp; These strikes will also lead to
the defeat and removal of the Taliban regime which, despite clear warnings
from the United States, has opted to continue to facilitate terrorists.&nbsp;
Other supporters of terrorism around the world, including nation-states,
should take due notice of these actions.
<p>&nbsp;The military effort is coupled with a global diplomatic effort
to cut off financial and political support for terrorists. The effort also
wisely includes a massive drop of food and medical supplies to the Afghan
victims of the Taliban's inhumane reign, thereby proving the falsehood
of the Taliban's mischaracterization of our efforts as a war against Islam.&nbsp;
Islam is a religion of peace, and the actions of the United States and
its allies are missions to create peace by destroying those who will not
permit peace.
<p>&nbsp;The United States and its allies will be successful in this first
campaign in the War Against Terrorism.&nbsp; We will stand ready to follow
up this effort with subsequent campaigns to uproot and eliminate this evil
from the world.
