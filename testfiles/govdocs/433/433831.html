  <br>
  In the Case of: Gideon M. Kioko, M.D., Petitioner, <br>
  - v. - <br>
  The Inspector General.<br>
  <br>
  DATE: April 16, 1993 </p>
<p>Docket No. C-92-115<br>
  Decision No. CR256<br>
  <br>
  DECISION</p>
<p>On May 12, 1992, the Inspector General (I.G.) notified Petitioner that he was 
  being excluded from <br>
  participation in the Medicare and State health care programs. 1/ The I.G. told 
  Petitioner that he was being <br>
  excluded under section 1128(b)(4)(B) of the Social Security Act (Act), based 
  on Petitioner's surrender of <br>
  his license to practice medicine in the State of Maryland. The I.G. told Petitioner 
  that he would be <br>
  excluded until the State of Maryland issued a license to him to practice medicine.</p>
<p>Petitioner requested a hearing and the case was assigned to Administrative 
  Law Judge Joseph K. Riotto for <br>
  a hearing and a decision. The I.G. moved for summary disposition and Petitioner 
  opposed the motion. The <br>
  I.G. argued that summary disposition in his favor was compelled by regulations 
  which mandated the <br>
  exclusion imposed against Petitioner, citing 42 C.F.R. 1001.501(b) (1992). Petitioner 
  asserted that the <br>
  exclusion was not mandated by regulation, arguing that administrative law judges 
  had held that the <br>
  regulation relied on by the I.G. did not establish criteria by which exclusions 
  were to be adjudicated at <br>
  hearings before administrative law judges.</p>
<p>On November 25, 1992, Judge Riotto issued a ruling which in part granted and 
  in part denied the I.G.'s <br>
  motion for summary disposition. Judge Riotto concluded that the I.G. had authority 
  to exclude Petitioner <br>
  pursuant to section 1128(b)(4) of the Act. He concluded, however, that there 
  existed disputed issues of <br>
  material fact which necessitated an administrative hearing as to the reasonableness 
  of the exclusion. Judge <br>
  Riotto concluded that regulations at 42 C.F.R. Part 1001, published and effective 
  on January 29, 1992, <br>
  which included 42 C.F.R. 1001.501(b), did not establish criteria for review 
  of exclusions by <br>
  administrative law judges.</p>
<p>The case was then reassigned to me. I scheduled an evidentiary hearing to address 
  those issues not decided <br>
  by Judge Riotto's ruling. On January 29, 1993, the I.G. again moved for summary 
  disposition. In this <br>
  motion, the I.G. argued that the Secretary had, by regulation published on January 
  22, 1993, mandated that <br>
  administrative law judges adjudicate the length of exclusions pursuant to the 
  criteria contained in the <br>
  January 29, 1992 regulations, including 42 C.F.R. 1001.501(b). I provided Petitioner 
  the opportunity to <br>
  respond to the motion, and Petitioner opposed the motion. In his opposition, 
  Petitioner contended that the <br>
  regulations relied on by the I.G. were ultra vires section 1128 of the Act in 
  that they denied him his right to <br>
  a hearing as to the reasonableness of the exclusion.</p>
<p>I have carefully considered the parties' arguments and the applicable law and 
  regulations. I conclude that <br>
  there exists no issue of disputed material fact in this case. I find that the 
  exclusion imposed and directed by <br>
  the I.G. is mandated by 42 C.F.R. 1001.501(b). Therefore, I enter summary disposition 
  in this case in <br>
  favor of the I.G. I sustain the exclusion which the I.G. imposed and directed 
  against Petitioner. 2/</p>
<p><br>
  ISSUE</p>
<p>The issue in this case is whether the exclusion imposed and directed against 
  Petitioner by the I.G. is <br>
  mandated by 42 C.F.R. 1001.501(b).</p>
<p><br>
  FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</p>
<p>1. Petitioner is a physician. See I.G. Ex. 1, at 3, 6. 3/</p>
<p>2. On October 17, 1991, the Maryland Board of Physician Quality Assurance (Maryland 
  Board) charged <br>
  Petitioner with acts of misconduct, including: unprofessional conduct in the 
  practice of medicine; <br>
  practicing medicine with an unauthorized person or aiding an unauthorized person 
  in the practice of <br>
  medicine; and failing to meet appropriate standards for the delivery of quality 
  medical and surgical care <br>
  performed in an outpatient surgical facility, office, hospital, or any other 
  location in Maryland. I.G. Ex. 2, <br>
  at 1 - 2.</p>
<p>3. On December 3, 1991, Petitioner surrendered to the Maryland Board his license 
  to practice medicine in <br>
  the State of Maryland. I.G. Ex. 1, at 6 - 7.</p>
<p>4. Petitioner surrendered his license to practice medicine in Maryland to avoid 
  prosecution by the <br>
  Maryland Board on charges that he had engaged in acts of misconduct. I.G. Ex. 
  1, at 4 - 5; Finding 3.</p>
<p>5. As a consequence of surrendering his license to practice medicine in Maryland, 
  Petitioner is not <br>
  permitted to practice medicine in Maryland until and unless his license is reinstated 
  by the Maryland <br>
  Board. I.G. Ex. 1, at 3, 5 - 6.</p>
<p>6. The charges filed against Petitioner by the Maryland Board constituted a 
  formal disciplinary proceeding <br>
  by a State licensing authority concerning Petitioner's professional competence 
  or performance. Finding 2; <br>
  Social Security Act, section 1128(b)(4)(B).</p>
<p>7. Petitioner surrendered his license to practice medicine while a formal disciplinary 
  proceeding was <br>
  pending before the Maryland Board concerning Petitioner's professional competence 
  or performance. <br>
  Findings 2, 6; Social Security Act, section 1128(b)(4)(B).</p>
<p>8. The Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services 
  (the Secretary) delegated <br>
  to the I.G. the authority to determine, impose, and direct exclusions pursuant 
  to section 1128 of the Act. 48 <br>
  Fed. Reg. 21,662 (1983).</p>
<p>9. The I.G. had authority to impose and direct an exclusion against Petitioner 
  pursuant to section <br>
  1128(b)(4)(B) of the Act. Findings 1 - 7; Social Security Act, section 1128(b)(4)(B).</p>
<p>10. The I.G. excluded Petitioner until he obtains a valid license to practice 
  medicine from the State of <br>
  Maryland.</p>
<p>11. Regulations published on January 29, 1992 establish criteria to be employed 
  by the I.G. in determining <br>
  to impose and direct exclusions pursuant to sections 1128(a) and (b) of the 
  Act. 42 C.F.R. Part 1001 <br>
  (1992).</p>
<p>12. The regulations published on January 29, 1992 include criteria to be employed 
  by the I.G. in <br>
  determining to impose and direct exclusions pursuant to section 1128(b)(4)(B) 
  of the Act. 42 C.F.R. <br>
  1001.501 (1992).</p>
<p>13. On January 22, 1993, the Secretary published a regulation which directs 
  that the criteria to be <br>
  employed by the I.G. in determining to impose and direct exclusions pursuant 
  to sections 1128(a) and (b) <br>
  of the Act are binding also on administrative law judges, appellate panels of 
  the Departmental Appeals <br>
  Board, and federal courts in reviewing the imposition of exclusions by the I.G. 
  58 Fed. Reg. 5617, 5618 <br>
  (1993) (to be codified at 42 C.F.R. 1001.1(b)).</p>
<p>14. My adjudication of the length of the exclusion in this case is governed 
  by the criteria contained in 42 <br>
  C.F.R. 1001.501(b). Findings 11, 13.</p>
<p>15. Under the criteria contained in 42 C.F.R. 1001.501(b), with the exception 
  of circumstances <br>
  enumerated in 42 C.F.R. 1001.501(c), an exclusion will never be for a period 
  of time less than the period <br>
  during which an individual's or entity's license is revoked, suspended, or otherwise 
  not in effect as a result <br>
  of, or in connection with, a State licensing agency action. 42 C.F.R. 1001.501(b)(1); 
  see 42 C.F.R. <br>
  1001.501(c).</p>
<p>16. Petitioner has neither proved nor contended that the exceptions contained 
  in 42 C.F.R. 1001.501(c) <br>
  apply in this case.</p>
<p>17. The exclusion in this case is for the same period of time as the period 
  of license revocation effectuated <br>
  by the Maryland Board. Findings 5, 10.</p>
<p>18. Under the criteria contained in 42 C.F.R. 1001.501(b), it is not relevant 
  that Petitioner may be <br>
  trustworthy to provide care to program beneficiaries or recipients at any time 
  prior to his becoming <br>
  licensed to practice medicine in Maryland. See P. Ex. 1.</p>
<p>19. There are no disputed issues of material fact in this case and summary 
  disposition is appropriate. <br>
  Findings 1 - 18.</p>
<p>20. The exclusion imposed and directed against Petitioner by the I.G. is mandated 
  by regulation. Findings <br>
  1 - 19.</p>
<p><br>
  ANALYSIS</p>
<p>The undisputed material facts of this case are that Petitioner, a physician, 
  had been licensed to practice <br>
  medicine in the State of Maryland. On December 3, 1991, Petitioner agreed to 
  surrender his license in <br>
  order to avoid facing formal disciplinary proceedings which had been initiated 
  against him. Those <br>
  proceedings involved charges that implicated directly Petitioner's professional 
  competence and <br>
  performance. Findings 2 - 4, 7. Petitioner's license surrender is of indefinite 
  duration. There is neither a <br>
  minimum nor maximum period of revocation. Petitioner may not practice medicine 
  in Maryland until his <br>
  license is reinstated. Finding 5.</p>
<p>Based on these undisputed facts, the I.G. determined to exclude Petitioner 
  from participating in Medicare <br>
  and Medicaid. The I.G. grounded his determination to exclude Petitioner on section 
  1128(b)(4)(B) of the <br>
  Act, which provides that the Secretary (or his delegate, the I.G.) may exclude 
  a party who surrenders a <br>
  license to provide health care to a State licensing authority while a formal 
  disciplinary proceeding is <br>
  pending before that authority concerning the party's professional competence, 
  professional performance, or <br>
  financial integrity.</p>
<p>There is no question in this case that the I.G. had authority to exclude Petitioner 
  pursuant to section <br>
  1128(b)(4)(B) of the Act. Petitioner admitted that he surrendered his license 
  to practice medicine in the <br>
  State of Maryland while a formal disciplinary proceeding was pending against 
  him. Petitioner's Opposition <br>
  to I.G.'s Motion for Summary Disposition at 2 (September 14, 1992). <br>
  The I.G. determined to exclude Petitioner until the State of Maryland reinstates 
  his license to practice <br>
  medicine. That is, effectively, an indefinite exclusion. The State of Maryland 
  may reinstate Petitioner's <br>
  license at any time, or it may never reinstate his license. Thus, the exclusion 
  which the I.G. imposed and <br>
  directed against Petitioner is potentially a lifetime exclusion from participating 
  in Medicare or Medicaid.</p>
<p>The I.G. contends that the indefinite exclusion which he imposed and directed 
  against Petitioner is <br>
  mandated by regulation. Therefore, according to the I.G., there exists no issue 
  of fact for me to hear and I <br>
  must issue summary disposition in his favor. Petitioner contends that he is 
  entitled to a de novo hearing as <br>
  to the reasonableness of the exclusion imposed and directed by the I.G. He contends 
  further that the Act <br>
  requires that exclusions be based on the trustworthiness of parties to provide 
  care to program beneficiaries <br>
  and recipients and that, therefore, he should be permitted to present evidence 
  as to his trustworthiness. He <br>
  asserts that any resolution of this case which denies him that right is contrary 
  to congressional intent and <br>
  unlawful.</p>
<p>Appellate panels of the Departmental Appeals Board (DAB) and administrative 
  law judges delegated to <br>
  hear cases under section 1128 of the Act have held consistently that section 
  1128 is a remedial statute. <br>
  Exclusions imposed pursuant to section 1128 have been found reasonable only 
  insofar as they are <br>
  consistent with the Act's remedial purpose, which is to protect program beneficiaries 
  and recipients from <br>
  providers who are not trustworthy to provide care. Robert Matesic, R.Ph., d/b/a 
  Northway Pharmacy, <br>
  DAB 1327, at 7 - 8 (1992). Exclusions which do not comport with this remedial 
  purpose may be punitive, <br>
  and, therefore, unlawful. Civil remedy statutes cannot be applied constitutionally 
  to produce punitive <br>
  results in the absence of traditional constitutional guarantees such as the 
  right to counsel, the right to trial <br>
  by jury, or the right against self-incrimination. Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 
  372 U.S. 144, 168 - 69 <br>
  (1963). Labeling an action taken pursuant to a civil remedies statute as &quot;remedial&quot; 
  does not immunize that <br>
  action from scrutiny as to its effect. An action taken pursuant to a civil remedies 
  statute may be punitive in <br>
  effect and, therefore, unlawful, if it does not comport with that statute's 
  remedial purpose.</p>
<p>In Matesic, a DAB appellate panel discussed the kinds of evidence which must 
  be considered by <br>
  administrative law judges in hearings as to the reasonableness of exclusions. 
  That evidence includes <br>
  evidence which relates to:</p>
<p> the nature of the offenses committed by the provider, the circumstances surrounding 
  the offense, <br>
  whether and when the provider sought help to correct the behavior which led 
  to the offense, how far the <br>
  provider has come toward rehabilitation, and any other factors relating to the 
  provider's character and <br>
  trustworthi-ness.</p>
<p>Matesic, DAB 1327, at 12.</p>
<p>Hearings before administrative law judges as to the reasonableness of exclusions 
  have been held by DAB <br>
  appellate panels to be de novo, and not appellate, hearings. Bernardo G. Bilang, 
  M.D., DAB 1295 (1992); <br>
  Eric Kranz, M.D., DAB 1286 (1991). Any party excluded pursuant to section 1128 
  of the Act is entitled to <br>
  an administrative hearing as to the exclusion's reasonableness. Section 1128(f) 
  of the Act provides that an <br>
  excluded party's hearing rights shall be those conferred by section 205(b) of 
  the Act. That section provides <br>
  for de novo hearings. An excluded party may offer evidence at a hearing under 
  sections 1128 and 205(b) <br>
  which is relevant to the issue of reasonableness, even if that evidence was 
  not considered by the I.G. in <br>
  making his exclusion determination.</p>
<p>Under the Act, the burden of proof is on the I.G. to establish that the length 
  of any exclusion imposed <br>
  against a party is reasonable. An excluded party has the statutory right to 
  rebut evidence presented by the <br>
  I.G. in a de novo hearing, or to introduce affirmative proof that is relevant 
  to the issue of his or her <br>
  trustworthiness to provide care.</p>
<p>The DAB's appellate panels have held specifically that exclusions imposed and 
  directed pursuant to section <br>
  1128(b)(4) of the Act are not per se reasonable if they are coterminous with 
  State license suspensions or <br>
  revocations. Kranz, DAB 1286, at 11; Bilang, DAB 1295, at 8. In the case of 
  an exclusion imposed and <br>
  directed pursuant to section 1128(b)(4), the I.G. may establish by the preponderance 
  of the evidence that an <br>
  exclusion which is coterminous in duration with a State license suspension or 
  revocation is reasonable. <br>
  However, whether that is reasonable in any given case necessarily depends on 
  evidence which relates to a <br>
  party's trustworthiness to provide care, and the relationship between that party's 
  trustworthiness and the <br>
  term of a license revocation or suspension. Thus, under the Act, exclusions 
  which are coterminous in <br>
  duration with State license suspensions or revocations are not automatically, 
  or even presumptively, <br>
  reasonable. Under the Act, the criteria identified by the DAB's appellate panel 
  in Matesic for evaluating <br>
  the reasonableness of permissive exclusions apply to all permissive exclusions, 
  including those imposed <br>
  pursuant to section 1128(b)(4). 4/</p>
<p>The Bilang case involved facts and issues which are indistinguishable from 
  those presented here. The <br>
  petitioner in Bilang surrendered his license to practice medicine to a State 
  licensing authority (Florida) in <br>
  order to avoid a finding of misconduct by that licensing authority. As with 
  this case, no final adjudication <br>
  of misconduct was made against the petitioner by the licensing authority. The 
  I.G. excluded the petitioner <br>
  pursuant to section 1128(b)(4)(B) of the Act based on the petitioner's surrender 
  of his license. The I.G. <br>
  asserted that an indefinite exclusion coterminous with the license surrender 
  was per se reasonable. <br>
  Therefore, according to the I.G., it was erroneous for an administrative law 
  judge to accept evidence from <br>
  the petitioner concerning his trustworthiness to provide care.</p>
<p>The DAB's appellate panel disagreed with the I.G.'s argument that the exclusion 
  was per se reasonable. It <br>
  held that the petitioner was entitled to a hearing at which he would be permitted 
  to show that, <br>
  notwithstanding his license surrender, he was trustworthy to provide care:</p>
<p> In drafting section 1128(b)(4)(B) of the Act, Congress was concerned that 
  individuals not evade an <br>
  exclusion by the expedient of surrendering their license. Congress recognized 
  the probability that <br>
  providers who surrender their licenses to provide health care in the face of 
  disciplinary proceedings <br>
  ordinarily do so to avoid the stigma of an adverse finding. See S. Rep. No. 
  109, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. 2, <br>
  reprinted in 1987 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News 682, 688. The scheme Congress 
  established in section <br>
  1128 permits the Secretary to conserve program resources by relying where possible 
  on other federal or <br>
  state court or administrative findings. However, Congress did not require imposition 
  of an exclusion on all <br>
  providers who surrendered their licenses, nor mandate any particular period 
  of exclusion in such <br>
  circumstances. This grant of discretion to the Secretary is inconsistent with 
  the I.G.'s apparent position that <br>
  the surrender of a license creates a presumption of culpability which cannot 
  be rebutted for any purpose.</p>
<p>Bilang, DAB 1295, at 8 (emphasis added).</p>
<p>On January 29, 1992, the Secretary published regulations which established 
  criteria for the I.G. to apply in <br>
  determining, imposing, and directing exclusions pursuant to section 1128 of 
  the Act. The I.G. has argued <br>
  since then that the exclusion determination criteria contained in these regulations 
  apply also as criteria for <br>
  adjudica-tion of the length of exclusions at administrative hearings. Administrative 
  law judges have held <br>
  consistently that these regulations do not establish criteria for adjudication 
  of the length of exclusions. <br>
  Bertha K. Krickenbarger, R.Ph., DAB CR250 (1993); Tajammul H. Bhatti, M.D., 
  DAB CR245 (1992); <br>
  Narinder Saini, M.D., DAB CR217 (1992), aff'd, DAB 1371 (1992); Sukumar Roy, 
  M.D., DAB CR205 <br>
  (1992); Steven Herlich, DAB CR197 (1992); Stephen J. Willig, M.D., DAB CR192 
  (1992); Aloysius <br>
  Murcko, D.M.D., DAB CR189 (1992); Charles J. Barranco, M.D., DAB CR187 (1992). 
  The Willig <br>
  decision held specifically that section 1001.501(b) of the regulations, governing 
  the I.G.'s exclusion <br>
  determina-tions under section 1128(b)(4) of the Act, which is at issue here 
  also, did not apply in <br>
  administrative hearings concerning such exclusions.</p>
<p>The decisions in the above cases were based on two conclusions. First, the 
  January 29, 1992 regulations <br>
  were not intended by the Secretary to strip parties retroactively of rights 
  vested prior to January 29, 1992. <br>
  Therefore, the regulations did not apply to any cases arising from exclusion 
  determinations made prior to <br>
  that date. Behrooz Bassim, M.D., DAB 1333, at 5 - 9 (1992). 5/ Second, the Secretary 
  did not intend Part <br>
  1001 of the regulations to establish criteria for administrative hearings as 
  to the length of exclusions. 6/</p>
<p>The present case does not involve an issue of retroactive application of regulations, 
  because the exclusion <br>
  determination is dated May 12, 1992, after publication of the January 29, 1992 
  regulations. Therefore, the <br>
  only question concerning the regulations' application is whether the Secretary 
  intended these regulations to <br>
  apply as criteria for adjudication of the length of exclusions.</p>
<p>The administrative law judge decisions which addressed the issue of applicability 
  found that the new <br>
  regula-tions, if applied as criteria for review of exclusions, would place the 
  Secretary in opposition to the <br>
  requirements of the Act. If applied at the level of the administrative hearing, 
  the regulations would conflict <br>
  squarely with the remedial criteria of the Act. 42 C.F.R. 1001.501(b), for example, 
  mandates that <br>
  exclusions imposed pursuant to section 1128(b)(4) be coterminous with the State 
  license revocations or <br>
  suspensions on which the exclusions are based. This is in direct conflict with 
  the Act, as interpreted by the <br>
  DAB's appellate panels in Kranz, Bilang, and Matesic. Furthermore, the new regulations 
  would strip <br>
  parties of their rights to de novo hearings guaranteed to them by section 205(b) 
  of the Act, because these <br>
  regulations, if applicable as criteria for administrative adjudications of the 
  reasonableness of exclusions, <br>
  would bar parties from presenting evidence which is relevant to their trustworthiness 
  to provide care. <br>
  Indeed, as applied to this case, the new regulations require the conclusion 
  that an exclusion coterminous <br>
  with a State license revocation is per se reasonable without an evidentiary 
  hearing. This is precisely the <br>
  result which the DAB's appellate panel in Bilang found to be beyond that which 
  Congress authorized the <br>
  Secretary to impose. 7/</p>
<p>The administrative law judge decisions concluded that the Secretary did not 
  intend to publish regulations <br>
  which might conflict with the requirements of the Act. They found support for 
  this conclusion on several <br>
  grounds. First, the decisions found that the Part 1001 regulations neither stated 
  nor suggested that they <br>
  applied at the level of the administrative hearing. The decisions held that 
  the plain meaning of the Part <br>
  1001 regulations was to establish criteria for the I.G. to use in making exclusion 
  determinations. Thus, the <br>
  Part 1001 regula-tions, did not, on their face, apply to administrative hearings. 
  Krickenbarger, DAB <br>
  CR250, at 15 - 16.</p>
<p>Second, the administrative law judge decisions found that there was nothing 
  in the Part 1001 regulations or <br>
  the commentary to those regulations which either stated or suggested that the 
  Secretary intended the <br>
  regulations to overrule the DAB's interpretations of the Act. Even as administrative 
  law judges are <br>
  delegated authority to hear and decide cases on the Secretary's behalf, and 
  to interpret law and regulations <br>
  for the Secretary, the DAB is delegated authority to make final interpretations 
  of law on behalf of the <br>
  Secretary. The decisions concluded that, had the Secretary intended to supersede 
  the DAB's appellate <br>
  decisions by his enactment of regulations, he would have said so. Id. at 16.</p>
<p>Third, the decisions concluded that the Part 1001 regulations would conflict 
  with other regulations adopted <br>
  by the Secretary on January 29, 1992, if they were held to establish criteria 
  for adjudication of the <br>
  reasonable-ness of exclusions. The Part 1001 regulations are part of a broader 
  enactment which includes <br>
  regulations which explicitly establish the authority of administrative law judges 
  to conduct hearings <br>
  pursuant to section 1128 of the Act (and pursuant to other sections, as well). 
  These are contained in Part <br>
  1005 of the new regulations. The Part 1005 regulations also make explicit certain 
  rights which inure to <br>
  parties in hearings held pursuant to the Act. The Part 1005 regulations contain 
  many sections which <br>
  become meaningless when the Part 1001 regulations are applied as a standard 
  for reviewing the reasonable-<br>
  ness of exclusion determinations. These include sections which establish and 
  define the authority of <br>
  administra-tive law judges and sections which define the parties' rights to 
  present evidence in <br>
  administrative hearings. Id. at 16 - 17.</p>
<p>Finally, the administrative law judge decisions concluded that the Part 1001 
  regulations could be read as <br>
  codifying I.G. policy, without construing them as being applicable at all levels 
  of review. Id. at 18. In so <br>
  holding, the administrative law judges noted that there had never been a particular 
  nexus between the <br>
  criteria employed by the I.G. to make exclusion determinations and criteria 
  employed by administrative <br>
  law judges or the DAB's appellate panels to evaluate the reasonableness of such 
  determinations.</p>
<p>Administrative Law Judge Riotto's November 25, 1992 ruling in this case, which 
  in part denied the I.G.'s <br>
  motion for summary disposition, was on all fours with these decisions. An in-person 
  hearing was <br>
  scheduled pursuant to Judge Riotto's ruling and also pursuant to the decisions 
  which held that the Part 1001 <br>
  regulations did not establish criteria for administrative adjudica-tions of 
  exclusions. The decision to <br>
  schedule an in-person hearing was made also in light of Petitioner's representation 
  that, at such a hearing, <br>
  he would present evidence concerning his trustworthiness which addressed the 
  factors identified as <br>
  controlling that issue in Matesic. See, e.g., P. Ex. 1. Had I held an in-person 
  hearing, I would have <br>
  received evidence, either from the I.G. or from Petitioner, that would have 
  related to the issue of <br>
  Petitioner's trustworthiness. It is possible that, based on that evidence, I 
  would have modified the exclusion <br>
  to a term of years. See Kranz, Bilang. It is also possible that I might have 
  sustained the exclusion imposed <br>
  and directed by the I.G.</p>
<p>However, on January 22, 1993, the Secretary published a new regulation. 8/ 
  This regulation states that:</p>
<p> The regulations in . . . [Part 1001] are applicable and binding on the Office 
  of Inspector General (OIG) <br>
  in imposing and proposing exclusions, as well as to Administrative Law Judges 
  (ALJs), the Departmental <br>
  Appeals Board (DAB), and federal courts in reviewing the imposition of exclusions 
  by the OIG . . . .</p>
<p>58 Fed. Reg. 5618 (to be codified at 42 C.F.R. 1001.1(b)). Interpretive comments 
  to this new regulation <br>
  emphasize that the exclusion determination criteria contained in Part 1001 must 
  be applied by <br>
  administrative law judges in evaluating the length of exclusions imposed and 
  directed by the I.G.</p>
<p>The regulations were made applicable to cases which were pending on January 
  22, 1993, the regulations' <br>
  publication date. 58 Fed. Reg. 5618. The present case is a &quot;pending case&quot; 
  inasmuch as the exclusion <br>
  determination was made on May 12, 1992, after the January 29, 1992 effectuation 
  date of the Part 1001 <br>
  regulations. 9/</p>
<p>Thus, I am now required to apply the criteria of the Part 1001 regulations 
  as standards for adjudicating the <br>
  length of exclusions imposed and directed by the I.G. The previous decisions 
  concerning the applicability <br>
  of these regulations, including Judge Riotto's ruling in this case, have been 
  overruled by the January 22, <br>
  1993 regulation.</p>
<p>Petitioner argues that I cannot lawfully apply the Part 1001 regulations here, 
  because to do so would <br>
  deprive him of due process rights guaranteed to him under the Act. This is, 
  effectively, an argument that <br>
  the regulations are ultra vires. I am without authority to rule that the regulations 
  are ultra vires. 42 C.F.R. <br>
  1005.4(c)(1).</p>
<p>The Part 1001 regulations require, at 42 C.F.R. 1001.501(b), that exclusions 
  imposed and directed by the <br>
  I.G. pursuant to section 1128(b)(4) of the Act, be coterminous with the State 
  license suspensions or <br>
  revocations on which those exclusions are based. Petitioner does not argue here 
  that he would qualify for <br>
  the exceptions to this requirement contained in 42 C.F.R. 1001.501(c). Therefore, 
  the regulation <br>
  mandates that the exclusion in this case be coterminous with the indefinite 
  license revocation imposed by <br>
  the Maryland Board. Evidence as to Petitioner's trustworthiness to provide care 
  is now irrelevant, because <br>
  the regulation does not permit consideration of such evidence here. Therefore, 
  there is no basis in this case <br>
  for an in-person evidentiary hearing. I enter summary disposition in favor of 
  the I.G. sustaining the <br>
  indefinite exclusion imposed and directed against Petitioner. 10/</p>
<p><br>
  CONCLUSION</p>
<p>I conclude that the I.G. had authority to impose and direct an exclusion against 
  Petitioner pursuant to <br>
  section 1128(b)(4)(B) of the Act. I conclude that the indefinite exclusion imposed 
  and directed against <br>
  Petitioner by the I.G. is in accord with 42 C.F.R. 1001.501(b). Therefore, I 
  enter summary disposition in <br>
  favor of the I.G. sustaining the exclusion.</p>

  Steven T. Kessel<br>
  Administrative Law Judge</p>
<p>1. &quot;State health care program&quot; is defined by section 1128(h) of the 
  Social Security Act to cover three <br>
  types of federally financed health care programs, including Medicaid. Unless 
  the context indicates <br>
  otherwise, I use the term &quot;Medicaid&quot; hereafter to represent all State 
  health care programs from which <br>
  Petitioner was excluded.</p>
<p>2. I hereby cancel the in-person hearing which I had scheduled, for the reasons 
  set forth later in this <br>
  Decision. Also, I deny as moot the I.G.'s motion to compel Petitioner to respond 
  to the I.G.'s discovery <br>
  request.</p>
<p>3. The I.G. submitted three exhibits in support of his original motion for 
  summary disposition. <br>
  Petitioner did not dispute the authenticity or the truth of the contents of 
  these exhibits. Petitioner submitted <br>
  one exhibit, consisting of his own affidavit, in opposition to the I.G.'s original 
  motion for summary <br>
  disposition. The I.G. did not dispute the authenticity or the truth of the contents 
  of this exhibit. Judge <br>
  Riotto did not specifically cite to either the I.G.'s exhibits or Petitioner's 
  exhibit in his November 25, 1992 <br>
  ruling. However, it is evident from the ruling that he relied on the exhibits. 
  I am admitting into evidence <br>
  the I.G.'s exhibits as I.G. Ex. 1, 2, and 3, and Petitioner's exhibit as P. 
  Ex. 1. </p>
<p>4. The criteria identified in Matesic do not apply to exclusions imposed pursuant 
  to sections 1128(a)(1) <br>
  and (a)(2) of the Act for terms of five years. Congress mandated exclusions 
  of at least five years for all <br>
  exclusions imposed pursuant to sections 1128(a)(1) and (a)(2). Social Security 
  Act, sections 1128(a)(1), <br>
  (2), 1128(c)(3)(B).</p>
<p>5. Central to the DAB appellate panel's holding that the regulations did not 
  apply retroactively was a <br>
  finding that the I.G.'s interpretation of the January 29, 1992 regulations represented 
  a departure from policy <br>
  previously enunciated by the DAB. The appellate panel considered and rejected 
  the I.G.'s argument that, in <br>
  requiring most exclusions based on State license revocations and suspensions 
  to be coterminous with such <br>
  revocations and suspensions, 42 C.F.R. 1001.501(c) merely restated the DAB's 
  interpetation of section <br>
  1128(b)(4) on the Secretary's behalf:</p>
<p> [T]here is no merit to the I.G.'s argument that his interpetation of the 1992 
  Regulations comports with <br>
  prior Board decisions, with respect to prohibiting review of matters considered 
  during the state licensing <br>
  proceeding and requiring a coterminous exclusion.</p>
<p>DAB 1333, at 8 (footnote omitted).</p>
<p><br>
  6. The I.G. filed a notice of appeal with the DAB in Willig, but then withdrew 
  it. Krickenbarger was the <br>
  first of the administrative law judge decisions to examine an exclusion determination 
  made after January <br>
  29, 1992. Thus, Krickenbarger was the first decision to present the issue of 
  the applicability of the Part <br>
  1001 regulations independent of the issue of retroactive application of the 
  regulations that had been <br>
  addressed by the appellate panel in Bassim.</p>
<p>7. The I.G. argues that the new regulations are similar to those found lawful 
  by the United States <br>
  Supreme Court in Heckler v. Campbell, 461 U.S. 458 (1983). The Campbell decision 
  involved regulations <br>
  adopted by the Social Security Administration to facilitate the processing of 
  disability cases under the Act. <br>
  The regulations simplified the processing of disability cases by resolving certain 
  medical-vocational issues <br>
  that were common to many cases. The Supreme Court held that the regulations 
  were not ultra vires the <br>
  Act. In holding that the regulations were not ultra vires, the Supreme Court 
  found that they determined <br>
  issues that did not require case-by-case consideration, in a manner which was 
  consistent with that which <br>
  Congress had intended. 461 U.S. at 467. Furthermore, the Supreme Court noted 
  that: &quot;The regulations <br>
  here . . . state that an administrative law judge will not apply the rules contained 
  in the guidelines when <br>
  they fail to describe a claimant's particular limitations.&quot; 461 U.S. at 
  468 n.11. Thus, these regulations were <br>
  held not to be ultra vires because: (1) they promoted outcomes which were consistent 
  with congressional <br>
  intent, and (2) they permitted claimants to argue that the regulations did not 
  resolve the issues as uniquely <br>
  applied in their particular cases. By contrast, the Part 1001 regulations would 
  direct outcomes based on <br>
  criteria which are inconsistent with congressional intent, as found by the DAB's 
  appellate panels in Kranz, <br>
  Bilang, and Matesic, and would prohibit petitioners from offering evidence to 
  show that the regulations did <br>
  not resolve the issues as uniquely applied in their particular cases. </p>
<p>More recently, the United States Supreme Court has held that regulations promulgated 
  pursuant to the <br>
  Social Security Act are ultra vires where they impose standards for relief which 
  are stricter than those <br>
  embodied in the Act, or where they deny claimants for benefits the opportunity 
  to show that the regulations <br>
  should not direct an outcome given the unique circumstances which pertain in 
  particular cases. Sullivan v. <br>
  Zebley, 493 U.S. 521 (1990). Zebley involved the lawfulness of regulations which 
  directed the outcomes <br>
  of applications for disability for children eligible for benefits under the 
  Supplemental Security Income <br>
  program. </p>
<p>8. The new regulation was approved by then-Secretary Louis W. Sullivan on December 
  18, 1992. 58 <br>
  Fed. Reg. 5618.</p>
<p>9. Thus, it is not necessary for me to conclude as a matter of law, nor do 
  I conclude, that the Part 1001 <br>
  regulations apply to cases in which exclusion determinations were made prior 
  to January 29, 1992.</p>
<p>10. One consequence of my decision is that Petitioner will be excluded indefinitely 
  without a hearing <br>
  either before a State agency or within this Department as to his trustworthiness 
  to provide care. Petitioner <br>
  gave up his opportunity to have a hearing before the Maryland Board on the State 
  charges against him <br>
  when he surrendered his license to that agency. The new regulations preclude 
  Petitioner from having a <br>
  hearing before me concerning his trustworthiness to provide care. <br>
