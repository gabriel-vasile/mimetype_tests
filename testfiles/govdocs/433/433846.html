  Keith O. Irby and Michelle P. Irby, R. Ph., Petitioner, <br>
  - v. -<br>
  The Inspector General. </p>
<p>DATE: July 13, 1994<br>
  <br>
  Docket No. C-243<br>
  Decision No. CR321<br>
  <br>
  DECISION</p>
<p>On March 27, 1990, the Inspector General (I.G.) notified Petitioner<br>
  Keith Irby that he was being excluded from participating in<br>
  Medicare and State health care programs. On April 6, 1990, the<br>
  I.G. notified Petitioner Michelle Irby that she was being excluded<br>
  from participating in Medicare and State health care programs. 1/ <br>
  The I.G. told each Petitioner that the basis for the exclusion was<br>
  that Petitioners were convicted of criminal offenses related to<br>
  Medicare, within the meaning of section 1128(a)(1) of the Social<br>
  Security Act (Act). The I.G. advised each Petitioner that the<br>
  minimum mandatory period of exclusion for an individual convicted<br>
  of an offense within the meaning of section 1128(a)(1) was five<br>
  years. The I.G. advised each Petitioner, however, that based on<br>
  the circumstances of that Petitioner's case, the I.G. had<br>
  determined to exclude each Petitioner for 20 years.</p>
<p>Both Petitioners requested a hearing, and the cases were assigned<br>
  to me for hearings and decisions. I decided that the cases should<br>
  be consolidated for purposes of holding a single hearing, in light<br>
  of facts which were common to both cases. Neither of the<br>
  Petitioners nor the I.G. objected to my determination to<br>
  consolidate the cases. 2/</p>
<p>The cases were stayed by consent of all parties while Petitioners<br>
  appealed their convictions of criminal offenses. I continued the<br>
  stays, with the mutual consent of all parties, for various<br>
  additional reasons. 3/ The cases were heard in a consolidated<br>
  hearing in Houston, Texas, on November 16 and 17, 1993. I received<br>
  additional testimony by telephone on December 15, 1993. The<br>
  parties filed posthearing briefs. 4/</p>
<p>I have carefully considered the applicable law, the evidence,<br>
  and the parties' arguments. 5/ I conclude that the exclusions<br>
  which the I.G. imposed on Petitioners are excessive. I modify the<br>
  exclusion which the I.G. imposed on Petitioner Keith Irby to a term<br>
  of 10 years. I modify the exclusion which the I.G. imposed on<br>
  Petitioner Michelle Irby to a term of five years.</p>
<p> ISSUE</p>
<p>The issue in this case is whether the 20-year exclusion which the<br>
  I.G. imposed and directed against each Petitioner is reasonable.</p>

  2.</p>
<p>20. Petitioners were convicted of criminal offenses related to the<br>
  delivery of items or services under Medicare. Findings 1 - 11; Tr.<br>
  at 21; Social Security Act, section 1128(a)(1).</p>
<p>21. The Secretary of the United States Department of Health and<br>
  Human Services (Secretary) delegated to the I.G. the authority to<br>
  determine, impose, and direct exclusions pursuant to section 1128<br>
  of the Act. 48 Fed. Reg. 21,662 (1983).</p>
<p>22. The I.G. had authority to impose and direct an exclusion<br>
  against Petitioners pursuant to section 1128(a)(1) of the Act. <br>
  Findings 20 - 21.</p>
<p>23. The minimum period of exclusion which must be imposed for an<br>
  individual who is convicted of a criminal offense within the<br>
  meaning of section 1128(a)(1) of the Act is five years. Social<br>
  Security Act, section 1128(c)(3)(B).</p>
<p>24. On March 27, 1990, the I.G. excluded Petitioner Keith Irby<br>
  from participating in Medicare and Medicaid for 20 years, pursuant<br>
  to section 1128(a)(1) of the Act. I.G. Ex. 6.</p>
<p>25. On April 6, 1990, the I.G. excluded Petitioner Michelle Irby<br>
  from participating in Medicare and Medicaid for 20 years, pursuant<br>
  to section 1128(a)(1) of the Act. I.G. Ex. 18.</p>
<p>26. Regulations published on January 29, 1992 establish criteria<br>
  to be employed by the I.G. in determining to impose and direct<br>
  exclusions pursuant to sections 1128(a) and (b) of the Act. 42<br>
  C.F.R. Part 1001 (1992).</p>
<p>27. The regulations include criteria to be employed by the I.G. in<br>
  determining to impose and direct exclusions pursuant to section<br>
  1128(a)(1) of the Act. 42 C.F.R. 1001.101, 1001.102.</p>
<p>28. On January 22, 1993, the Secretary published a regulation<br>
  clarifying that the criteria to be employed by the I.G. in<br>
  determining to impose and direct exclusions pursuant to sections<br>
  1128(a) and (b) of the Act are binding also on administrative law<br>
  judges, appellate panels of the Departmental Appeals Board (DAB),<br>
  and federal courts in reviewing the imposition of exclusions by the<br>
  I.G. 42 C.F.R. 1001.1(b); 58 Fed. Reg. 5617, 5618 (1993).</p>
<p><br>
  29. The regulations published on January 29, 1992 governing<br>
  exclusions pursuant to section 1128(a)(1) of the Act are not<br>
  applicable to these cases, because the Secretary did not intend to<br>
  strip Petitioners retroactively of rights vested prior to January<br>
  29, 1992.</p>
<p>30. Section 1128 of the Act is a remedial statute.</p>
<p>31. The standard to be employed in evaluating the reasonableness<br>
  of the length of the exclusions which the I.G. imposed against<br>
  Petitioners is whether the exclusions are necessary to protect the<br>
  integrity of federally financed health care programs and the<br>
  welfare of the beneficiaries and recipients of those programs from<br>
  individuals who are untrustworthy.</p>

<p>58. A five-year exclusion of Petitioner Michelle Irby is<br>
  reasonable, in light of the remedial purpose of section 1128 of the<br>
  Act.</p>
<p> RATIONALE</p>
<p>Petitioners do not dispute that they were convicted of criminal<br>
  offenses related to the delivery of items or services under<br>
  Medicare, within the meaning of section 1128(a)(1) of the Act. Nor<br>
  do Petitioners deny that, as a consequence of their convictions,<br>
  they must be excluded for a minimum of five years. However, each<br>
  Petitioner contends that an exclusion of that Petitioner for more<br>
  than five years is unreasonable, given the facts of that<br>
  Petitioner's case. Therefore, the issue I must resolve with<br>
  respect to each Petitioner is whether the 20-year exclusion imposed<br>
  against each Petitioner is excessive, and if so, to what extent<br>
  should I modify the term of the exclusion.</p>
<p>1. Regulations published by the Secretary on January 29, 1992 are<br>
  not applicable to these cases.</p>
<p>A threshold issue in these cases involves the standard of review I<br>
  must use in adjudicating the reasonableness of the exclusion<br>
  imposed against each Petitioner. The I.G. argues that I must apply<br>
  the criteria contained in regulations published by the Secretary on<br>
  January 29, 1992 at 42 C.F.R. Part 1001. Specifically, the I.G.<br>
  argues that the reasonableness of the length of each exclusion must<br>
  be measured only by the aggravating and mitigating factors<br>
  contained in 42 C.F.R. 1001.201. I conclude that the Secretary<br>
  did not intend that the regulations in Part 1001 apply<br>
  retroactively to cases pending as of January 29, 1992. Therefore,<br>
  I find that the reasonableness of the exclusions must be<br>
  adjudicated pursuant to the standard which prevailed as of the date<br>
  the exclusions were imposed.</p>
<p>Appellate panels of the DAB and administrative law judges delegated<br>
  to hear cases under section 1128 of the Act have held consistently<br>
  that section 1128 is a remedial statute. Exclusions imposed<br>
  pursuant to section 1128 have been found reasonable only insofar as<br>
  they are consistent with the Act's remedial purpose, which is to<br>
  protect the integrity of federally financed health care programs<br>
  and the welfare of beneficiaries and recipients of those programs<br>
  from individuals and entities who are not trustworthy to provide<br>
  care. Robert Matesic, R.Ph., d/b/a Northway Pharmacy, DAB 1327, at<br>
  7 - 8 (1992). Exclusions which do not comport with this remedial<br>
  purpose may be punitive, and therefore, unlawful.</p>
<p>In Matesic, an appellate panel of the DAB discussed the kinds of<br>
  evidence which should be considered by administrative law judges in<br>
  hearings as to the reasonableness of exclusions. That evidence<br>
  included evidence which related to:</p>
<p> the nature of the offenses committed by the provider, the<br>
  circumstances surrounding the offense, whether and when the<br>
  provider sought help to correct the behavior which led to the<br>
  offense, how far the provider has come toward rehabilitation, and<br>
  any other factors relating to the provider's character and<br>
  trustworthiness.</p>
<p>Matesic, DAB 1327, at 12.</p>
<p>On January 29, 1992, the Secretary published regulations which,<br>
  among other things, governed the I.G.'s imposition of exclusions<br>
  pursuant to section 1128 of the Act. 42 C.F.R. Parts 1001 - 1007. <br>
  These regulations contain criteria which apply specifically to<br>
  exclusions imposed by the I.G. pursuant to section 1128(a)(1). 42<br>
  C.F.R. 1001.101 - 1001.102. The regulations state that, in the<br>
  case of an exclusion imposed pursuant to section 1128(a)(1), the<br>
  exclusion may be increased beyond the statutory five-year minimum<br>
  exclusion period if any of specified aggravating factors are<br>
  present. 42 C.F.R. 1001.102(b)(1) - (6). Specified mitigating<br>
  factors may be used to offset aggravating factors and may serve as<br>
  a basis to reduce the length of an exclusion imposed pursuant to<br>
  section 1128(a)(1). 42 C.F.R. 1001.102(c)(1) - (3). However,<br>
  in no event may an exclusion be reduced below the five-year<br>
  statutory minimum exclusion period. This regulation makes plain<br>
  that only factors which are identified in the regulation as<br>
  aggravating or mitigating may be used as a basis for lengthening or<br>
  reducing an exclusion. To the extent that factors identified in<br>
  Matesic as being relevant to the trustworthiness of a party do not<br>
  fall within the aggravating and mitigating factors identified by<br>
  the regulation, they may not be used to determine the length of an<br>
  exclusion.</p>
<p>After the 1992 regulations were published, the I.G. contended that<br>
  the Part 1001 regulations should apply to establish criteria for<br>
  adjudicating the reasonableness of the length of exclusions<br>
  determined pursuant to section 1128 of the Act in all cases which<br>
  were pending as of January 29, 1992. However, an appellate panel<br>
  of the DAB held that the Secretary did not intend that these<br>
  regulations were to apply retroactively to exclusion determinations<br>
  made prior to the regulations' publication date. Behrooz Bassim,<br>
  M.D., DAB 1333, at 5 - 9 (1992). 7/</p>
<p>A central conclusion in Bassim is that the 1992 regulations effect<br>
  a change in the substantive criteria by which exclusions are<br>
  determined. Id., at 6, 7. The appellate panel noted that<br>
  retroactivity is not favored in the law. Id., at 6. It held that<br>
  the authority to promulgate rules having a retroactive effect must<br>
  be granted to an agency expressly by Congress. Id. It held<br>
  further that if Congress does include such a statutory grant in its<br>
  enabling legislation, the promulgated rules will not be applied<br>
  retroactively unless their language clearly requires this result. <br>
  Id. The appellate panel found that neither the legislative history<br>
  of the statute which authorized the 1992 regulations, nor section<br>
  1128 of the Act, provided any support for concluding that the 1992<br>
  regulations should be applied retroactively. Id., at 7. In so<br>
  holding, it stated that:</p>
<p> In our view, if the Secretary had intended to effect<br>
  substantive changes in pending cases, this intent would have been<br>
  expressly stated since this effect would create administrative<br>
  complications in the appeals process, as well as potential<br>
  prejudice for petitioners.</p>
<p>Id.</p>
<p>On January 22, 1993, the Secretary published additional<br>
  regulations. These regulations include a provision which clarifies<br>
  the Part 1001 regulations by stating that the Part 1001 regulations<br>
  apply to establish a standard of review in adjudications of<br>
  exclusions before administrative law judges, appellate panels of<br>
  the DAB, and federal courts. 42 C.F.R. 1001.1(b). 8/</p>
<p>This clarification was to be applied to &quot;all pending and future<br>
  cases under this authority.&quot; 58 Fed. Reg. 5618 (1993). <br>
  Then-Secretary Sullivan waived the proposed notice and public<br>
  comment period specified by the Administrative Procedure Act. In<br>
  doing so, he cited as authority the exception for &quot;interpretive<br>
  rules, general statements of policy or rules of agency<br>
  organization, procedure, or practice&quot; at 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A). <br>
  Id. The Secretary stated that the clarification &quot;does not<br>
  promulgate any substantive changes to the scope of the January 29,<br>
  1992 final rule, but rather seeks only to clarify the text of that<br>
  rulemaking to better achieve our original intent.&quot; Id.</p>
<p>These cases involve exclusions which were imposed prior to January<br>
  29, 1992. 9/ The I.G. asserts that the effect of the 1993<br>
  clarification is to require that these cases be adjudicated<br>
  pursuant to the criteria contained in the Part 1001 regulations<br>
  published in January 1992. The I.G. premises this argument<br>
  entirely on the Secretary's intent to apply the clarification to<br>
  &quot;all pending cases . . . .&quot; In effect, the I.G. would have the<br>
  1992 regulations apply retroactively to adjudicate the<br>
  reasonableness of the exclusions imposed against Petitioners, based<br>
  on the 1993 clarification and the commentary published with that<br>
  clarification. 10/</p>
<p>I conclude that the Secretary did not require expressly in the 1993<br>
  clarification that the 1992 regulations be applied retroactively to<br>
  cases pending as of January 29, 1992. To the contrary, the more<br>
  persuasive reading of the 1993 clarification is that it did nothing<br>
  to change the interpretation of the 1992 regulations prevailing as<br>
  of the date of publication of the 1993 clarification, which was<br>
  that the 1992 regulations were not intended to apply retroactively.</p>
<p>The issue of whether then-Secretary Sullivan intended the 1993<br>
  clarification to apply the 1992 regulations retroactively -- to<br>
  exclusions imposed prior to January 29, 1992 -- was decided by<br>
  Administrative Law Judge Steinman in Domingos R. Freitas, DAB<br>
  CR272, at 37 - 40 (1993). I have considered Judge Steinman's<br>
  analysis and find it to be persuasive. The I.G. has offered no<br>
  arguments in these cases which were not considered and decided by<br>
  Judge Steinman in Freitas.</p>
<p>As Judge Steinman observed in Freitas, the DAB's appellate panels<br>
  are delegated authority to make final interpretations of law on<br>
  behalf of the Secretary in reviewing decisions of administrative<br>
  law judges. DAB CR272 at 37; Gideon M. Kioko, M.D., DAB CR256<br>
  (1993). At the time that the 1993 clarification was published, the<br>
  Secretary's final interpretation of the 1992 regulations was the<br>
  Bassim decision, which stated that the Secretary did not intend the<br>
  1992 regulations to apply retroactively. Nothing in the 1993<br>
  clarification or the comments to that clarification suggests that<br>
  the Secretary intended to overrule this interpretation. To the<br>
  contrary, the comments to the 1993 clarification state<br>
  unequivocally that the 1993 clarification did not make &quot;any<br>
  substantive changes&quot; to the &quot;scope&quot; of the 1992 regulations. 
  58<br>
  Fed. Reg. 5618. Therefore, the reasonable implication of the 1993<br>
  clarification is that it did not intend to overrule an existing<br>
  interpretation on behalf of the Secretary that the 1992 regulations<br>
  were not to be applied retroactively to cases pending prior to<br>
  January 29, 1992.</p>
<p>Had then-Secretary Sullivan intended the 1993 clarification to<br>
  overrule the DAB's appellate panel decision in Bassim, he would<br>
  have in effect overruled his own previous interpretation of the<br>
  1992 regulations. That in turn would have constituted a<br>
  substantive change in the manner in which the 1992 regulations were<br>
  applied. Such a substantive change could not have been published<br>
  legitimately without compliance with the notice and comment<br>
  requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act. The<br>
  determination to publish the 1993 clarification as an excepted<br>
  statement means that the Secretary did not intend to change his<br>
  previously stated interpretation. As Judge Steinman found in<br>
  Freitas:</p>
<p> Since the January 29, 1992 regulations lacked retroactive<br>
  effect for the reasons stated in Bassim, they could not have<br>
  acquired such effect with subsequent textual clarifications that do<br>
  not purport to modify the scope of the January 29, 1992 regulations<br>
  and have been published without satisfying the procedures necessary<br>
  under the Administrative Procedure Act for effecting substantive<br>
  changes.</p>
<p>DAB CR272 at 40.</p>
<p>I conclude that the statement that the 1993 clarification applied<br>
  to &quot;pending&quot; cases does not mean that the Secretary intended to<br>
  apply the 1992 regulations retroactively to cases pending as of<br>
  January 29, 1992. Given the fact that the Secretary did not<br>
  overrule his own statement of interpretation in Bassim, given that<br>
  the Secretary stated that he did not intend the 1993 clarification<br>
  to effect any substantive change, and given further, the fact that<br>
  the 1993 clarification was published under an exception to the<br>
  Administrative Procedure Act which does not apply to regulations<br>
  having substantive effect, I conclude that the Secretary intended<br>
  the 1993 clarification to apply the 1992 regulations only to those<br>
  exclusions which were imposed after January 29, 1992. Cases<br>
  involving exclusions imposed before that date must be adjudicated<br>
  pursuant to the standard in effect as of the date of the exclusion,<br>
  which consists of the remedial criteria of section 1128 as<br>
  explained in the Matesic decision.</p>
<p>2. The exclusions which the I.G. imposed against Petitioners are<br>
  excessive.</p>
<p>The exclusions which the I.G. imposed against Petitioners are<br>
  excessive when examined in light of the remedial criteria of<br>
  section 1128 and the Matesic decision. I conclude that the<br>
  exclusions must be modified to avoid an unlawful punitive effect.</p>
<p>Both Petitioners were convicted of the same crimes. These crimes<br>
  consisted of 14 counts of mail fraud. The essence of the crimes<br>
  was that Petitioners, through the vehicle of a durable medical<br>
  equipment company which they owned and operated, deceived<br>
  physicians into certifying that their patients, Medicare<br>
  beneficiaries, qualified for certain durable medical equipment. <br>
  Petitioners then used the certifications which they obtained from<br>
  physicians to defraud the Medicare program into reimbursing them<br>
  for durable medical equipment for which beneficiaries did not, in<br>
  actuality, qualify. Findings 2 - 11. Petitioners were convicted<br>
  of mail fraud totalling about $10,000. Findings 34, 47. These are<br>
  serious crimes. They were committed over a period of more than one<br>
  year. Findings 33, 46. They embody elements of willfulness and<br>
  intent. I infer from Petitioners' convictions that they engaged in<br>
  a deliberate scheme to defraud Medicare. It is reasonable to find<br>
  from the circumstances of these crimes that Petitioners are<br>
  untrustworthy individuals and that federally funded programs need<br>
  to be protected from the possibility that they may engage in<br>
  conduct in the future which is damaging.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the offenses of which Petitioners were convicted<br>
  do not appear nearly so serious as has been asserted by the I.G. <br>
  It is evident that the I.G. premised the determination to impose<br>
  20-year exclusions against Petitioners on the conclusion that the<br>
  crimes of which Petitioners were convicted were merely indicia of<br>
  far more serious fraud by Petitioners. Petitioners' convictions<br>
  were depicted by the I.G. as comprising merely the tip of an<br>
  iceberg that consisted of a wide-ranging, massive fraud against<br>
  Medicare.</p>
<p>In both the notices which the I.G. sent to Petitioners and at the<br>
  hearing, the I.G. contended that Petitioners had engaged in fraud<br>
  which resulted in approximately $1.5 million in overpayments by<br>
  Medicare to entities which Petitioners controlled. However, the<br>
  I.G. failed to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that<br>
  these Petitioners engaged in fraud beyond the approximately $10,000<br>
  for which they were convicted. The I.G. did not substantiate the<br>
  allegations of a broader and more damaging scheme. Consequently,<br>
  exclusions cannot be premised on offenses beyond that for which<br>
  Petitioners were convicted.</p>
<p>The evidence on which the I.G. relied to prove the alleged<br>
  overpayments consisted primarily of the results of audits that Blue<br>
  Cross and Blue Shield of Texas, the Medicare carrier for the State<br>
  of Texas, performed of Medicare reimbursement claims that had been<br>
  presented by corporations owned and operated by Petitioners. The<br>
  I.G. presented the testimony of an employee of Blue Cross and Blue<br>
  Shield of Texas, Debbie Lewis. Tr. at 142 - 161. Ms. Lewis<br>
  testified that she is a supervisor of claims examiners. Tr. at<br>
  143. She testified that Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas<br>
  concluded that entities controlled by Petitioners had been overpaid<br>
  by Medicare by approximately $1.5 million based on an audit which<br>
  consisted of a random sampling of claims presented by these<br>
  entities. I.G. Ex. 27, 28; Tr. at 143 - 144, 147 - 149, 151. The<br>
  claims actually reviewed by Blue Cross and Blue Shield comprised a<br>
  small percentage of the total claims which were estimated to be<br>
  overpaid. Tr. at 154 - 157. She characterized sampling as a<br>
  &quot;valid methodology&quot; in determining Medicare overpayments. Tr. at<br>
  144.</p>
<p>I do not find Ms. Lewis' testimony to be persuasive for the<br>
  following reasons. First, the I.G.'s assertion that the sampling<br>
  performed here is reliable is without foundation. The I.G. failed<br>
  to establish that Ms. Lewis has sufficient expertise in statistics<br>
  to certify the accuracy of the sampling performed here. The I.G.<br>
  offered no evidence as to Ms. Lewis' education in statistics. Nor<br>
  did the I.G. offer evidence as to the statistical validity of the<br>
  sampling which Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas performed,<br>
  except to assert without foundation that sampling (not necessarily<br>
  this sampling) is a valid methodology for ascertaining the<br>
  existence of overpayments. 11/ </p>
<p>Indeed, Ms. Lewis suggested in her testimony that the sampling<br>
  performed here may have been biased in favor of finding<br>
  overpayments. She testified that where an inquiry to a provider<br>
  produced no response, that non response would be used as a basis<br>
  for finding an overpayment for the sampled claim about which the<br>
  inquiry was made. Tr. at 157 - 158. I am not persuaded that a<br>
  provider's failure to respond to an inquiry justifies the<br>
  conclusion that an overpayment was made. Yet, based on Ms. Lewis'<br>
  testimony, it appears that Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas<br>
  would use the failure to respond to the inquiry not only to find an<br>
  overpayment, but to find many overpayments, inasmuch as Blue Cross<br>
  and Blue Shield of Texas would extrapolate the finding of one<br>
  overpayment over the entire universe of claims from which the<br>
  sample was taken.</p>
<p>Second, the I.G. never defined what she meant by the term<br>
  &quot;overpayment.&quot; I do not infer from the way this term was used by<br>
  Ms. Lewis that Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas' findings of<br>
  overpayments necessarily were limited to claims that Blue Cross and<br>
  Blue Shield of Texas concluded to be false or fraudulent. From the<br>
  context, the term could mean payments based on simple error by Blue<br>
  Cross and Blue Shield of Texas or by the entities whose claims were<br>
  examined. It could mean also payments based on a good faith,<br>
  albeit incorrect, interpretation of payment guidelines by Blue<br>
  Cross and Blue Shield of Texas or by the entities whose claims were<br>
  examined. I cannot conclude that entities controlled by<br>
  Petitioners were overpaid based on fraud unless the evidence<br>
  establishes that the determination that overpayments were made is<br>
  based on fraudulent claims.</p>
<p>The I.G. offered evidence to prove that Petitioners have been found<br>
  to be liable in a lawsuit brought against them under the False<br>
  Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. 3729 et seq., as amended, in the amount of<br>
  $180,056.76. I.G. Ex. 55. I do not find from the judgment against<br>
  Petitioners that Petitioners were found to have committed fraud<br>
  against Medicare in an amount greater than the approximately<br>
  $10,000 of which they were convicted. The judgment was based<br>
  solely on the 14 counts of mail fraud of which Petitioners were<br>
  convicted. P. Ex. 21, pp. 4 - 7. The damages comprise a trebling<br>
  of the dollar amount of Petitioners' fraud plus civil penalties in<br>
  the amount of $150,000. Id., p. 6.</p>
<p>In addition, throughout this proceeding, the I.G. has contended<br>
  that the criminal activity which resulted in Petitioners'<br>
  convictions occurred over a period of at least five years. To<br>
  support this contention, the I.G. relies on a general statement in<br>
  the indictment alleging that Petitioners engaged in a criminal<br>
  scheme from October 7, 1983 through the date of the return of the<br>
  indictment on June 9, 1989. However, the 14 specific counts which<br>
  formed the basis of Petitioner's conviction covered a period<br>
  spanning from December 13, 1985 through July 15, 1988. Thus,<br>
  notwithstanding the allegation contained in the indictment that<br>
  Petitioners' criminal activity occurred over a period of more than<br>
  five years, I find that the evidence establishes that the specific<br>
  counts of which Petitioners were convicted occurred over a period<br>
  of only two and a half years.</p>
<p>In summary, I conclude that the I.G. did not prove that the ambit<br>
  of Petitioners' crimes extends beyond the 14 counts of mail fraud<br>
  totalling about $10,000, of which they were convicted. These are<br>
  serious crimes, and they certainly provide evidence to support the<br>
  conclusion that Petitioners are not trustworthy providers of care. <br>
  On the other hand, the record of this case fails to establish<br>
  anything approaching the offenses which the I.G. alleges<br>
  Petitioners committed. That calls into question the need for such<br>
  severe exclusions as the I.G. imposed, inasmuch as the I.G. plainly<br>
  premised those exclusions on the conclusion that Petitioners had<br>
  committed fraud greatly in excess of that of which they had been<br>
  convicted.</p>
<p> a. The exclusion imposed against Petitioner Keith Irby</p>
<p>I conclude that the offenses of which Petitioner Keith Irby was<br>
  convicted are not so serious as to justify the imposition of a<br>
  20-year exclusion. An exclusion of that length is for all<br>
  practical purposes, a permanent ban on claiming reimbursement from<br>
  Medicare or Medicaid. Given the remedial purpose of section 1128,<br>
  exclusions of such length must be reserved for those individuals<br>
  and entities who have demonstrated by their conduct that they can<br>
  never again be trusted to provide care or to claim reimbursement<br>
  for the items or services which they provide. The 14 counts of<br>
  mail fraud of which Petitioner Keith Irby was convicted, while<br>
  serious offenses, simply do not amount to offenses that are so<br>
  serious as to merit on their face what amounts to a permanent<br>
  exclusion.</p>
<p>However, the evidence in Petitioner Keith Irby's case establishes<br>
  that he remains an untrustworthy individual. I conclude that,<br>
  while a 20-year exclusion is excessive, an exclusion of 10 years is<br>
  merited.</p>
<p>To begin with, Petitioner Keith Irby has not expressed remorse for<br>
  his criminal misconduct. To the contrary, he asserts adamantly<br>
  that he engaged in no misconduct, and that, in fact, he is not<br>
  guilty of the offenses of which he has been convicted. Tr. at 209<br>
  - 210. Absent persuasive evidence to the contrary, Petitioner's<br>
  intransigent refusal to admit misconduct might suggest a propensity<br>
  on his part to engage in similar unlawful conduct in the future.</p>
<p>In addition, Petitioner Keith Irby has not yet completed the terms<br>
  of his sentence. Although he has paid the fine which was imposed<br>
  by the court, he has not completed the community service which he<br>
  was sentenced to perform.</p>
<p>More significant is the fact that Petitioner Keith Irby has been<br>
  less than fully compliant with the terms and conditions of his<br>
  probation. He is still serving the five-year term of probation to<br>
  which he was sentenced. Subsequent to his conviction and<br>
  sentencing, Petitioner Keith Irby was convicted of the offense of<br>
  driving while intoxicated. This subsequent conviction is a<br>
  violation of the terms of his probation and it suggests a<br>
  continuing propensity to run afoul of the law.</p>
<p>Not only was Petitioner Keith Irby convicted of the offense of<br>
  driving while intoxicated, but he withheld from his probation<br>
  officer the fact of his conviction. Petitioner Keith Irby's<br>
  failure to disclose this conviction to his probation officer is an<br>
  additional violation of the terms of his probation. It suggests a<br>
  propensity on the part of Petitioner Keith Irby to be dishonest<br>
  with government officials when it serves his purposes.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I find that Petitioner Keith Irby was not credible in<br>
  his testimony at the hearing which I conducted. In his account of<br>
  his conviction for driving while intoxicated, he asserted that the<br>
  officer who arrested him threw out test results which showed that<br>
  Petitioner Keith Irby was not intoxicated, and repeated the test<br>
  three more times until he obtained a result which showed that he<br>
  was intoxicated. Tr. at 202. He suggested that, as part of his<br>
  plea to the charge of driving while intoxicated, it had been agreed<br>
  that his conviction of this offense would not be reported to<br>
  federal probation authorities. Id. This self-serving account of<br>
  the events surrounding his conviction for driving while intoxicated<br>
  lacks the ring of truth. I conclude that his dishonesty in the<br>
  hearing which I conducted is additional evidence of his continuing<br>
  lack of trustworthiness.</p>
<p>I modify the exclusion imposed against Petitioner Keith Irby to a<br>
  term of 10 years. That is a very lengthy exclusion and it reflects<br>
  my conclusion that he remains an untrustworthy individual. It<br>
  takes into account also the seriousness of the offenses of which he<br>
  was convicted.</p>
<p> b. The exclusion imposed against Petitioner Michelle Irby </p>
<p>As I find with respect to Petitioner Keith Irby, I conclude that a<br>
  20-year exclusion of Petitioner Michelle Irby is not merited based<br>
  on the seriousness of the offenses of which she was convicted. I<br>
  find that, based on evidence pertaining to her case, the exclusion<br>
  should be modified to a term of five years, which is the minimum<br>
  exclusion period mandated by the Act for individuals convicted of<br>
  criminal offenses, within the meaning of section 1128(a)(1).</p>
<p>There is substantial evidence to suggest that Petitioner Michelle<br>
  Irby will soon not pose a serious threat to federally financed<br>
  health care programs and to program beneficiaries and recipients. <br>
  The evidence in this case establishes that, since her conviction,<br>
  Petitioner Michelle Irby has conducted her life in an exemplary<br>
  fashion. This is strong evidence of rehabilitation and of<br>
  trustworthiness.</p>
<p>Petitioner Michelle Irby is a pharmacist. In the months following<br>
  her conviction she obtained jobs as a pharmacist in order to<br>
  support herself and her family. Her employers testified at the<br>
  hearing that I conducted that she comported herself in these jobs<br>
  with complete honesty and integrity. She was entrusted with<br>
  filling prescriptions for controlled substances. She served as a<br>
  mentor for a pharmacy student. Her exemplary performance in these<br>
  jobs is indicative of trustworthiness.</p>
<p>Petitioner Michelle Irby has sought to continue her education. Her<br>
  current enrollment in medical school suggests considerable<br>
  diligence on her part and is further evidence of her<br>
  rehabilitation.</p>
<p>Other evidence of Petitioner Michelle Irby's trustworthiness<br>
  consists of the fact that she completed her five years' probation<br>
  in 33 months. I infer from this that, during the period of her<br>
  probation, she complied strictly with the rules and requirements<br>
  established by her probation officer. She has completed the<br>
  community service aspect of her sentence, as well. There is no<br>
  evidence that, in the more than four years since she was sentenced<br>
  for her crimes, Petitioner Michelle Irby has engaged in unlawful<br>
  conduct.</p>
<p>I recognize that Petitioner Michelle Irby, like Keith Irby, has not<br>
  shown any remorse or acknowledged the unlawfulness of her criminal<br>
  misconduct. Under other circumstances, this refusal to admit<br>
  wrongdoing would justify an exclusion that is greater than the<br>
  minimum mandatory five-year period. However, in this case, I find<br>
  that Petitioner Michelle Irby's exemplary conduct since her<br>
  conviction outweighs any negative inferences which can be drawn<br>
  from her refusal to admit wrongdoing. Petitioner, by her actions,<br>
  has demonstrated a strong determination to be law-abiding and<br>
  trustworthy and I accord great weight to the exemplary manner in<br>
  which Petitioner has comported herself since her conviction.</p>
<p>I find that the preponderance of the evidence establishes a strong<br>
  likelihood that Petitioner Michelle Irby will remain trustworthy. <br>
  Given that conclusion, there is no need in this case for an<br>
  exclusion which is lengthier than the five-year statutory minimum.</p>
<p> CONCLUSION</p>
<p>I conclude that the 20-year exclusions which the I.G. imposed<br>
  against Petitioners are excessive. I modify the exclusion imposed<br>
  against Petitioner Keith Irby to a term of 10 years. I modify the<br>
  exclusion imposed against Petitioner Michelle Irby to a term of<br>
  five years.</p>

<p>1. &quot;State health care program&quot; is defined by section 1128(h) of<br>
  the Social Security Act to cover three types of federally financed<br>
  health care programs, including Medicaid. Unless the context<br>
  indicates otherwise, I use the term &quot;Medicaid&quot; hereafter to<br>
  represent all State health care programs from which Petitioners<br>
  were excluded.</p>
<p>2. The notices of exclusion which the I.G. sent to the<br>
  Petitioners refer to a corporation, Med-Equip Sales and Rentals,<br>
  Inc. (Med-Equip), as a corporation wholly owned by Petitioners. <br>
  The notices state that, by virtue of the exclusion, no payments<br>
  will be made to this corporation during the exclusion period. In<br>
  the initial prehearing conferences which I held in this case, the<br>
  I.G. contended that she may have determined also to exclude<br>
  Med-Equip. For that reason, I named Med-Equip as a party. In a<br>
  prehearing order dated June 12, 1992, I raised the issues of<br>
  whether Med-Equip had been excluded and whether the I.G. had<br>
  provided proper notification of the exclusion. In a motion dated<br>
  November 5, 1993, the I.G. asserted that she had not excluded<br>
  Med-Equip and that the corporation should not be a party. This<br>
  motion is supported by Petitioners. Accordingly, I determine that<br>
  Med-Equip is not a party to this case, and I have removed Med-Equip<br>
  from the caption of this decision.</p>
<p>3. These reasons included the withdrawal of Petitioners' first<br>
  counsel due to illness, the birth of a child to Petitioner Michelle<br>
  Irby, and providing the parties with an opportunity to engage in<br>
  settlement negotiations.</p>

  5. The evidence which I received from the I.G. at the hearing<br>
  included six volumes of transcripts of the criminal trial of<br>
  Petitioners. I.G. Ex. 49 - 54. Counsel for Petitioners objected<br>
  to my receiving these exhibits on the ground that they were<br>
  voluminous and that the I.G. had not shown the relevance of these<br>
  exhibits to the instant case. In receiving the exhibits, I advised<br>
  counsel for the parties that I expected that, in their posthearing<br>
  briefs, they would cite to any specific excerpts of these exhibits<br>
  that they contended were relevant. Tr. at 32 - 33. I told the<br>
  parties that it would be unlikely that I would read these exhibits<br>
  and make findings from them unless they directed my attention to<br>
  specific portions of them which they wished me to consider. I have<br>
  reviewed the excerpts of these exhibits cited by the parties in<br>
  their posthearing submissions. I have not read the remainder of<br>
  I.G. Ex. 49 - 54 and, with the exception of the excerpts cited by<br>
  the parties, I have not considered these exhibits in making my<br>
  decision in these cases. </p>
<p>6. I make separate Findings concerning the reasonableness of<br>
  the exclusions imposed against Petitioners Keith and Michelle Irby. <br>
  For the convenience of the parties, I have captioned these findings<br>
  with headings. The headings are not Findings nor are they intended<br>
  to alter the meaning of any of my Findings.</p>
<p>7. At issue in Bassim was an exclusion imposed pursuant to<br>
  section 1128(b)(4) of the Act. The specific section of the Part<br>
  1001 regulations which was at issue in that case is 42 C.F.R <br>
  1001.501. That regulation establishes mitigating and aggravating<br>
  factors to be used in determining exclusions pursuant to section<br>
  1128(b)(4) which are very similar to those established by 42 C.F.R.<br>
  1001.102 for exclusions imposed pursuant to section 1128(a)(1)<br>
  of the Act. The effect of 42 C.F.R. 1001.501 is the same as the<br>
  effect of 42 C.F.R. 1001.102, in that both regulations preclude<br>
  use of many of the factors identified as remedial in Matesic to<br>
  determine the length of exclusions. Although technically, Bassim<br>
  applies only to exclusions imposed pursuant to section 1128(b)(4)<br>
  of the Act, the appellate panel's decision in that case plainly is<br>
  intended to apply broadly to all exclusions imposed pursuant to<br>
  section 1128. Bassim, DAB 1333, at 8 - 9.</p>
<p>8. In a number of decisions issued between January 29, 1992 and<br>
  January 22, 1993, administrative law judges held that the Part 1001<br>
  regulations did not establish a standard for adjudicating the<br>
  reasonableness of exclusions. Bertha K. Krickenbarger, R.Ph., DAB<br>
  CR250 (1993) (decisions summarized therein at 10). An effect of 42<br>
  C.F.R. 1001.1(b) is to overrule these decisions. </p>
<p>9. Administrative law judges have held that the 1993<br>
  clarification requires that exclusions imposed after January 29,<br>
  1992 be adjudicated pursuant to the criteria contained in the Part<br>
  1001 regulations. Jose Ramon Castro, M.D., DAB CR259 (1993).</p>
<p>10. The I.G. did not aver that she used the criteria of the<br>
  1992 regulations to determine the length of the exclusions imposed<br>
  against Petitioners. These criteria were not in effect in 1990,<br>
  when Petitioners were excluded. The I.G. has not explained why the<br>
  Secretary would intend that criteria first published in 1992 should<br>
  be used retroactively to adjudicate exclusions which were imposed<br>
  at a time when such criteria had not been adopted by the Secretary.</p>
<p><br>
  11. In her posthearing brief, the I.G. asserted that sampling<br>
  is a methodology for ascertaining Medicare overpayments that has<br>
  been upheld in the courts. I.G.'s posthearing brief at 22. <br>
  However, assuming that to be so, the I.G. offered no evidence in<br>
  these cases to prove that the sampling methodology used here was<br>
  the same as that upheld in the cases cited by the I.G. in her<br>
  brief. <br>
