    <p><font face="Arial">Re: Telemarketing Rulemaking - Comment. FTC File No. 
    R411001</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">To the Commission:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">As a consumer and Small Business Owner, I have, for 
    many years, been extremely frustrated with the disruptiveness of the large 
    quantity of unsolicited telemarketing calls that I receive at both my home 
    and office locations.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">While I totally agree with the objective that the FTC 
    has in establishing a national DO NOT CALL list for consumers to opt out of 
    telemarketing calls, I believe that this proposed rule will prove to be 
    ineffective. In addition, the proposal to prohibit the blocking of Caller ID 
    information will be completely counter-productive, by eliminating the only 
    tool that consumers currently have to automatically filter out virtually 
    100% of unwanted telemarketing calls.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">My experience with prohibition of unsolicited FAXs in 
    the Telecommunications Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) and the FCC's complete 
    ineffectiveness in enforcing the statute and its own rules banning such 
    practices, makes me extremely skeptical that a national DO NOT CALL list 
    will work.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">While legitimate telemarketing companies will 
    presumably comply with the FTC's rules, the existence of FAX Broadcast 
    vendors blatantly advertising their services on the internet, in open 
    violation of federal law (<font COLOR="#0000ff"><u>www.express-advertising.com</u></font>,
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><u>www.amicron.com/fax</u></font>,
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><u>www.fax.com</u></font>, etc…) and the large number 
    of junk FAXs received daily by virtually everyone with a FAX machine, 
    demonstrates that there are a large number of unscrupulous operators who 
    will completely ignore the FTC's proposed DO NOT CALL database.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">For years, my wife and I have endured the nightly 
    assortment of telephone solicitations. However, after we started receiving 
    junk FAXs on a regular basis at 4AM, I contacted Qwest (my local phone 
    provider) and had them activate Anonymous Call Blocking on my telephone 
    line. In the last 2 months, since I have activated this feature, I have not 
    received a single junk FAX or telemarketing call.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Anonymous Call Blocking is available, as a standard 
    feature, with Caller ID from almost all local phone companies. With this 
    feature enabled, any caller who does not have identifiable Caller ID 
    information receives a recording telling them that the called number does 
    not accept unidentified calls, and permits the caller to enter their phone 
    number to complete the call.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">In my experience, which I think is typical for the 
    average consumer, the ONLY unidentified calls that I receive are from 
    telemarketers. The fact that virtually all telemarketers block their Caller 
    ID information (either intentionally, or due to equipment limitations), 
    provides a foolproof mechanism to automatically block these unwanted calls.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">If proposed Rule 310.4(a)(6) is adopted, it would 
    completely eliminate my ability to automatically screen out these calls. 
    Instead, every telemarketing call would ring my phone and require me to 
    check my caller ID device to see who is calling. This is just as disruptive 
    as answering the phone.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">I would like to offer an alternative solution to the 
    FTC:</font></p>
    <ol>
      <li><font face="Arial">The FTC Rules should REQUIRE that all unsolicited 
      telemarketing calls block their Caller ID information, thereby clearly 
      identifying themselves as telemarketers.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial">All local phone companies should be required to 
      offer Anonymous Call Blocking as a no charge feature, which each phone 
      subscriber can turn on or off from their local telephone (using *77 for ON 
      and *87 for OFF), regardless of whether or not the consumer subscribes to 
      the Caller ID feature.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial">The FTC, in cooperation with the local telephone 
      companies, should educate consumers on how they can use Anonymous Call 
      Blocking to eliminate unsolicited telemarketing calls.</font></li>
    </ol>
    <p><font face="Arial">This approach has a number of major advantages:</font></p>
    <ol>
      <li><font face="Arial">It takes advantage of existing telephone system 
      features that are currently deployed on almost all phone lines in the 
      United States, without requiring the development or deployment of any new 
      technology.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial">It does not require any centralized DO NOT CALL 
      database saving the FTC and the industry a tremendous amount of money and 
      other resources.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial">Because the blocking feature is controlled from the 
      customer's own telephone there are no issues on whether or not the 
      blocking is authorized by the consumer.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial">Call Blocking and Unblocking is handled 
      automatically by the telephone company's central office switch, and does 
      not require the intervention of any customer service agents, nor the 
      deployment of any new telephone equipment.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial">Telemarketers do not have to make any changes to 
      their existing procedures or equipment, and do not incur any additional 
      costs to fully comply with the FTC rules.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial">Telemarketers who have an established business 
      relationship with a customer can easily make calls to that customer, by 
      selectively enabling the Caller ID information for that call, thereby 
      bypassing any Call Blocking in effect. If this capability is abused, the 
      customer has access to the telemarketer's Caller ID information, which can 
      be supplied to law enforcement agencies for prosecution.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial">The technology is fully deployed and operational 
      NOW. All that is required to make it effective is consumer education.</font></li>
    </ol>
    <p><font face="Arial">It would be VERY unfortunate, if the Commission 
    inadvertently subverted this existing Call Blocking capability by the 
    adoption of proposed Rule 310.4(a)(6).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Please feel free to contact me if I can be of any 
    further assistance.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Sincerely,</font></p>
