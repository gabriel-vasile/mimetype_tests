          CHAIRMAN, SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE,<br>
          ON REPUBLICAN OBSTRUCTIONISM BLOCKING PASSAGE<br>
          OF THE FBI REFORM ACT<br>
          Thurs., June 20, 2002</p>
          </b>
          <p>Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, yesterday's Washington Post provides yet 
          another example of why it is so urgent that we act to pass S. 1974, 
          the Leahy-Grassley FBI Reform Act. Although that bill was <i>
          unanimously</i> reported out of the Judiciary Committee on April 25, 
          almost two months ago, an anonymous Republican hold has operated to 
          block Senate passage on the bill. It is troubling to me that an 
          anonymous Republican Senator would block passage of this bipartisan 
          effort to improve the FBI, the nation's leading counterterrorism 
          agency, at the same time that the President has sought bipartisan 
          efforts to pass his proposed Homeland Security reorganization.</p>
          <p>I urge the Republican Member or Members with a hold on this 
          legislation to remove the hold, or at least discuss whatever issue on 
          the merits that Senator may have.</p>
          <p>The press reported yesterday that two new FBI whistle-blowers have 
          come forward and provided information which might be crucial to the 
          FBI's anti-terrorism efforts. At least one of those whistle-blowers 
          has also provided information to the staff of the Judiciary Committee 
          that suggests, in its rush to beef up its translation capabilities 
          after September 11, the FBI may have relaxed both quality control and 
          its security standards. The Post also reported that at least some of 
          the allegations made by this whistle-blower had been verified, but 
          still that the woman was terminated by the FBI for &quot;disruptiveness.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>Because the Department of Justice's Inspector General is already 
          looking into this matter, Senator Grassley and I sent a letter to his 
          office based upon what we learned about the incident. This 
          whistle-blower makes allegations that amount to far more than just a 
          &quot;he-said, she-said&quot; internal office dispute. Rather, her allegations 
          raise significant security issues that should be addressed as part of 
          the Inspector General's review. The letter that I sent with Senator 
          Grassley poses specific questions that we hope the Inspector General 
          will examine as part of his investigation, including whether the 
          reaction to this woman's report is likely to chill future reporting of 
          security breaches by FBI employees. It is not a good management 
          practice for the FBI to fire the person who reports a security breach, 
          while nothing happens to the person who allegedly committed the 
          breach. That is precisely the kind of culture that Judge Webster found 
          helped FBI Supervisory Agent Robert Hanssen to get away with spying 
          for the Russians for over 20 years.</p>
          <p>Since the attacks of September 11 and the anthrax attacks last 
          fall, we have relied on the FBI to detect and prevent acts of 
          catastrophic terrorism that endanger the lives of the American people 
          and the institutions of our country. FBI reform was already important, 
          but the terrorist attacks suffered by this country last year have 
          imposed even greater urgency on improving the FBI. The Bureau is our 
          front line of domestic defense against terrorists. It needs to be as 
          great as it can.</p>
          <p>Even before those attacks, the Judiciary Committee's oversight 
          hearings revealed serious problems at the FBI that needed strong 
          congressional action to fix. We heard about a double standard in 
          evaluations and discipline. We heard about record and information 
          management problems and communications breakdowns between field 
          offices and Headquarters that led to the belated production of 
          documents in the Oklahoma City bombing case. Despite the fact that we 
          have poured money into the FBI over the last five years, we heard that 
          the FBI's computer systems were in dire need of modernization. We 
          heard about how an FBI supervisor, Robert Hanssen, was able to sell 
          critical secrets to the Russians undetected for years without ever 
          getting a polygraph. We heard that there were no fewer than 15 
          different areas of security at the FBI that needed fixing.</p>
          <p>The FBI Reform Act tackles these problems with improved 
          accountability, improved security both inside and outside the FBI, and 
          required planning to ensure the FBI is prepared to deal with the 
          multitude of challenges we are facing. It was unanimously reported by 
          the oversight committee for the FBI, and it reflects our determination 
          to make sure that the FBI is as good and strong as it can be - and, 
          all the more today, given the higher stakes -- as good and as strong 
          as America <u>needs</u> the FBI to be. This reform bill is a long 
          stride toward that goal.</p>
          <p>The case reported in yesterday's Washington Post and the matters 
          raised by Minneapolis Field Office Agent Coleen M. Rowley in her May 
          21, 2002 letter and subsequent testimony critiquing the handling of 
          the Moussaoui case by FBI Headquarters personnel provide case studies 
          for many of the precise issues that S. 1974, the FBI Reform Act, 
          addresses and why its passage is so critical in the FBI's effort to 
          fight terrorism. The Leahy-Grassley bill expands whistle-blower 
          protections to ensure that FBI whistle-blowers get the same 
          protections as other government employees. </p>
          <p>The FBI is currently exempted from the Whistleblower Protection 
          Act, and its employees are only protected by internal Department of 
          Justice regulations. For example, while Special Agent Rowley's letter 
          to the FBI Director and the Inspector General is protected under these 
          regulations, three of the five people to whom she sent her letter were 
          Members of Congress and are <b>not</b> covered under the current 
          regulations. Moreover, her testimony at the June 6 Judiciary Committee 
          oversight hearing, and before any other committee or subcommittee of 
          the Congress, is <b>not</b> protected under the current regulations. 
          Even a report or complaint to her immediate FBI supervisors would <b>
          not</b> be protected under the current regulations. That is why the 
          FBI Director's personal guaranty, and the Attorney General's 
          assurances, that she would be protected against retaliations is so 
          important. The Leahy-Grassley FBI Reform Act would extend 
          whistleblower protection for FBI employees to all these disclosures.
          </p>
          <p>The FBI Reform Act would also put an end to statutory restrictions 
          that contribute to the &quot;double standard,'' where senior management 
          officials are not disciplined as harshly for misconduct as line agents 
          are. Agent Rowley complained about this double standard, as have other 
          FBI agents who have helped the Judiciary Committee craft solutions to 
          the FBI's problems. </p>
          <p>The bill would provide expanded statutory authority for the DOJ 
          Inspector General to investigate internal problems at the FBI and help 
          design comprehensive, systematic solutions. It would create the Career 
          Security Officer Program that Judge Webster and FBI officials have 
          endorsed to prevent security breaches. </p>
          <p>These are not partisan provisions. The FBI Reform Act is the result 
          of bipartisan oversight hearings which the Judiciary Committee has 
          conducted over the last year. It was reported out of Committee <u><i>
          unanimously</i></u>. Now, when it reaches the Senate floor, it is 
          being blocked <u><i>anonymously</i></u>. The future of the FBI is too 
          important for politics. Too many Americans depend on it for their 
          safety. </p>
          <p>On June 7, 2002, I delivered a statement that highlighted 
          Republican holds on four important bipartisan pieces of legislation, 
          including important anti-terrorism legislation aimed at curbing 
          terrorist bombings. Less than a week later, the United States Embassy 
          in Karachi, Pakistan was bombed. The next morning, the Senate passed 
          my bill, S. 1770, to deal with that issue. </p>
          <p>I now appeal to the Republican Senator or Senators blocking the FBI 
          Reform Act to remove your hold so that we may pass this bill. The 
          American people deserve action, not politics as usual. Mr. President, 
          I ask unanimous consent that my entire statement be printed in the 
          Congressional Record in addition to yesterday's Washington Post 
          article and the letter I sent with Senator Grassley to the Justice 
          Department Inspector General. </p>
