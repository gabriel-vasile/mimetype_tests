52 FR 8798</h1>

<h3>Clinical Holds and Requests for Modification (ß 312.42) </h3>
<p>104. Several comments supported codifying clinical hold procedures in the regulations. 
  However, a number of comments objected to the proposed criteria for imposing 
  a clinical hold and also to the proposed procedures under which clinical holds 
  would be implemented. These specific objections are discussed in detail below. 
</p>
<p>105. One comment suggested that the standard for a clinical hold based on a 
  finding that the investigator brochure is "misleading, erroneous, or materially 
  incomplete" (proposed ß 312.42(b)(1)(iii)) be reworded to require a finding 
  that "the investigator brochure is materially misleading, erroneous, or incomplete." 
</p>
<p>The agency believes that any information in an investigator brochure that is 
  "misleading" or "erroneous" is presumptively "material" in terms of significance, 
  and therefore the explicit qualifier suggested by the comment is unnecessary. 
  However, the "incompleteness" of an investigator brochure may be of minimal 
  significance and, therefore, an insufficient basis for imposing a hold without 
  a further finding that the deficiency is material with respect to the function 
  of the brochure. Therefore, the agency concludes that this provision should 
  be retained as proposed. </p>
<p>106. Under proposed ß 312.42(b)(2)(ii), a clinical hold may be imposed on a 
  Phase 2 or 3 study where "the plan or protocol for investigation is clearly 
  deficient in design to meet its stated objectives." One comment objected to 
  the omission of this grounds for clinical hold from the criteria applicable 
  to Phase 1 studies. The comment contended that the safety of a study cannot 
  be evaluated without a critical inquiry into its scientific merits and concluded 
  that it would be difficult to assure subject safety absent a carefully drawn 
  research protocol. In contrast, several comments objected to the retention of 
  this criteria for studies in any phase. These comments contended that FDA's 
  mandate does not extend to stopping a clinical investigation based solely on 
  the agency's views of the scientific deficiencies of the investigation. Finally, 
  one comment contended that it is inappropriate to interrupt the course of a 
  planned clinical investigation, which may involve the investment of significant 
  amounts of time and financial resources, unless there is a well-founded concern 
  for the safety of study subjects. </p>
<p>As discussed in paragraph 31 above, FDA has both the authority and responsibility 
  to establish conditions, including a review of study design, to ensure that 
  a study that is conducted to develop evidence of a drug's safety and effectiveness 
  is designed to achieve its objectives. Review of study design may prevent unnecessary 
  mistakes, may assure the adequacy of a study, and may otherwise increase the 
  likelihood that completion of the study will generate the kind of data needed 
  to make a final determination about the drug's safety and effectiveness. </p>
<p>FDA is sensitive to the potential costs and disruptiveness of a clinical hold, 
  and will not impose a hold because of design problems unless it finds the study 
  to be "clearly deficient in design to meet its stated objectives." This intentionally 
  places a substantial burden on FDA to show that a design defect is critical 
  with respect to the purposes of the study. The criterion is a guarantee that 
  FDA will not casually impose clinical holds for trivial or easily correctable 
  design problems. When this standard is met, however, imposing a clinical hold 
  will preclude exposure of human subjects to risks in an investigation that FDA 
  concludes would ultimately have no scientific or regulatory value. It will also 
  save substantial drug development time, in the long run, by preventing continuation 
  of a study that could not possibly support marketing approval. </p>
<p>The agency discussed previously its reasons for "narrowing" the focus of Phase 
  1 review to matters of subject safety alone. As noted in that discussion, the 
  narrow focus reflects a desire to remove impediments to innovation at this early 
  stage of drug discovery. While the narrower focus may mean that some poorly 
  designed studies will be conducted that would otherwise have been placed on 
  clinical hold, FDA believes the likelihood of this happening is slight, and 
  that the safety considerations arising from such an occurrence are not significant 
  in that FDA will still have reviewed the study for subject safety generally. 
  On balance, therefore, FDA believes it appropriate to defer to sponsors on matters 
  of Phase 1 study design. </p>
<p>FDA notes that a number of potentially safety-related criteria are listed as 
  bases for terminations, but are not listed as bases for clinical holds. Thus, 
  for example, while ß 312.44(b)(1)(iii) authorizes FDA to terminate a study on 
  finding that the methods, facilities, and controls used for manufacturing the 
  drug "are inadequate to establish and maintain appropriate standards of identity, 
  strength, quality, and purity as needed for subject safety," this factor is 
  not listed among the bases for clinical holds under ß 312.42(b). The omission 
  of such specific criteria from the listed criteria for clinical holds is not 
  intended to suggest that they would not be a basis for a clinical hold, if the 
  particular deficiency posed an unreasonable and significant risk of illness 
  and injury to human subjects. To the contrary, FDA would view the deficiency 
  to be a proper basis for a clinical hold under the provisions of ß 312.42(b) 
  (1)(i) and (2)(i). </p>
<p>107. Several comments urged the creation of additional procedural safeguards 
  and a better appeals mechanism relating to the imposition of clinical holds. 
  One comment claimed that the promise in proposed ß 312.42(c) that FDA will, 
  before issuing the clinical hold order, attempt to discuss and satisfactorily 
  resolve the matter with the sponsor, can be interpreted to mean anything from 
  a casual attempt at telephone communication to a requirement for a formal meeting. 
  Given the potential significance of a clinical hold for a sponsor's drug development 
  plans, the comment urged that the sponsor be given 48-hour notice of a hold 
  imposed for safety reasons and longer notice for holds imposed for nonsafety 
  reasons. In either case, the comment urged that a sponsor be given the right 
  to meet or talk by telephone with the responsible reviewing official before 
  the hold goes into effect. Another comment, while conceding that it may be appropriate 
  to impose an immediately effective hold where the safety and rights of human 
  subjects are at stake, recommended that in all other cases a clinical hold not 
  become effective until the sponsor has exhausted all appeals rights including, 
  ultimately, the right to a regulatory hearing before the agency under Part 16. 
</p>
<p>The procedures governing the imposition of clinical holds are tailored to the 
  needs of a regulatory process that gives reviewers little time to decide whether 
  proposed studies should begin or ongoing studies continue: studies under an 
  IND may begin 30 days after FDA is given notice by the sponsor, and these same 
  studies, once begun, may be significantly changed in direction or scope under 
  protocol amendments without any advance notice to FDA. The relative informality 
  and flexibility of the clinical hold procedures, criticized by the comments, 
  are thus, in the agency's view, dictated by the nature of the process. </p>
<p>While the agency is committed to making a good faith attempt to discuss and 
  satisfactorily resolve deficiencies in an IND before considering the need to 
  impose a clinical hold, it does not believe that it is obligated to establish 
  procedural safeguards of the types suggested by the comments. The nature of 
  the agency contact with sponsors will depend on the imminence of hazard to human 
  subjects, on the availability of key agency and sponsor personnel, and on a 
  variety of other factors. </p>
<p>For similar reasons, FDA believes that it cannot in the abstract specify the 
  extent of notice that can appropriately be given a sponsor before making a hold 
  effective. </p>
<p>108. Several comments urged that the clinical hold provisions make clear the 
  agency's obligation to explain the reasons for a hold when it is imposed. </p>
<p>Agency practice has been to explain briefly the basis for a clinical hold when 
  it is imposed, and to follow up this initial communication with a written explanation 
  of the agency's action. FDA has revised the final rule to reflect this practice. 
</p>
<p>109. One comment urged that the procedures governing the resumption of a clinical 
  investigation placed on clinical hold be revised to permit the order rescinding 
  the hold to be made by or on behalf of the Division Director. (The proposal 
  provided that such rescission order could only be made by the Division Director.) 
  The comment also recommended that the clinical hold procedures specifically 
  permit FDA to authorize resumption of a study by telephone or by other means 
  of rapid communication. </p>
<p>FDA agrees with these suggestions and has revised the regulation accordingly. 
</p>
<p>110. Proposed ß 312.45(a) would give the agency the authority to convert an 
  IND to inactive status if all clinical investigations covered by the IND remain 
  on hold for 1 year or more. Several comments recommended revising this to state 
  that any IND on clinical hold will be placed on inactive status only in the 
  event that the clinical hold is no longer contested by the sponsor of the investigation. 
</p>
<p>FDA believes that as a matter of administrative efficiency -- to "clear the 
  books" -- it is appropriate that the agency retain the authority to place an 
  IND on inactive status if all studies under the IND have been on clinical hold 
  for at least 1 year. The 1 year between imposition of the clinical hold and 
  transfer to inactive status should generally be more than sufficient time to 
  raise and attempt resolution of the deficiencies that prompted the agency to 
  place the studies on clinical hold. </p>
<p>It should be noted that inactivation of a study under the circumstances described 
  by the comment is not automatic. Under ß 312.45(a), if FDA seeks to place a 
  study on inactive status, it must give the sponsor notice of the proposed action 
  and an opportunity to respond as to why the IND should remain active. The fact 
  that issues surrounding a clinical hold order remain under dispute may be a 
  legitimate basis for a sponsor request to continue an investigation as "active." 
</p>
<p>111. One comment urged that FDA elaborate on the scope of a clinical hold. 
  The comment claimed that it would not be reasonable to halt a study with six 
  investigators when only one had been found to be inadequately qualified to participate 
  in it. </p>
<p>If FDA finds that only one of several investigators named in an IND is not 
  qualified to conduct the investigation, the clinical hold order would ordinarily 
  be limited to the study conducted by that investigator. This concept is noted 
  in ß 312.42(a) of this final rule, which states that the clinical hold order 
  may apply to one or more of the investigations covered by an IND. </p>
<p>To ensure that the sponsor is informed of the precise limits of the clinical 
  hold order, FDA has revised the final rule to require the Division Director 
  (or the Director's designee) to specify in the initial communication to the 
  sponsor the studies to which the hold applies. </p>
<p>As proposed, the clinical hold procedures (ß 312.42) gave FDA 15 days from 
  the date of imposition of a clinical hold to provide the sponsor with a written 
  explanation of the basis for the action. On reconsideration, FDA concludes that 
  15 days may not allow the agency sufficient time to provide the sponsor with 
  a complete written explanation of the basis for its action. Accordingly, ß 312.42(d) 
  has been revised to require the agency to provide a written explanation "As 
  soon as possible, and in any event within 30 days of the imposition of the clinical 
  hold."</p>
<h3>Termination (ß 312.44) </h3>
<p>112. Under proposed ß 312.44(b)(1)(iv), FDA would be able to terminate an investigation 
  on a finding that clinical investigations are not being conducted in accordance 
  with the plan or protocol submitted. One comment suggested that minor departures 
  from these protocols and plans should not be the basis for terminating an IND, 
  and recommended conditioning such actions on a finding that the investigations 
  are being conducted in a manner "substantially different" from the plan or protocol 
  submitted. </p>
<p>The agency agrees and has revised the final rule accordingly. </p>
<p>113. Under ß 312.44(b)(2)(ii), FDA may terminate a Phase 2 or 3 investigation 
  if it finds that the investigational plan is not reasonable as a bona fide plan 
  to determine whether or not the drug is safe and effective for use. One comment 
  urged that this standard not be used to prevent or preclude pilot studies or 
  exploratory research that might not, taken alone, be satisfactory to establish 
  safety and effectiveness. Another comment objected to the standard on the grounds 
  that it would permit FDA to prevent clinical investigations "merely on the basis 
  of the agency's opinion as to the value of what FDA anticipates will be their 
  results." This comment urged that a determination under this provision require, 
  in addition, a finding that a continuation of the investigation would subject 
  human subjects to an unreasonable and significant risk of illness or injury. 
</p>
<p>Proposed ß 312.44(b)(2)(ii) was intended to give FDA grounds for terminating 
  an investigation that was not directed, overall, at evaluating safety and effectiveness 
  of the drug. The criterion would not provide grounds for terminating an investigation 
  simply because one or another study was considered inadequate. A bona fide investigational 
  approach may well include pilot studies, open safety studies, and other studies 
  that would not, by themselves, establish a drug's safety and effectiveness. 
</p>
<p>114. As proposed, ß 312.44(b)(2)(iii) would authorize FDA to terminate a study 
  on finding that "There is convincing evidence that the drug is effective for 
  the purpose for which it is being investigated." This provision has been corrected 
  in the final rule to read "There is convincing evidence that the drug is not 
  effective for the purpose for which it is being investigated." </p>
<p>115. Under proposed ß 312.44(d), FDA could immediately terminate an IND on 
  finding that the continuation would present a significant danger to the public 
  health. One comment suggested revising this language to condition an immediate 
  termination on a finding of an "unreasonable, direct, and substantial danger 
  to the health of individuals." </p>
<p>The agency believes that the immediate termination procedure should focus more 
  directly on the health of individuals and therefore has revised ß 312.44(d) 
  in this final rule to condition such terminations on a finding of "an immediate 
  and substantial danger to the health of individuals." </p>
<h3>Inactive Status (ß 312.45) </h3>
<p>116. Several comments objected to the provisions under which FDA could terminate 
  an IND that has been on inactive status for 5 years. One comment suggested that 
  the prospect of termination eliminates the principal value of inactive status 
  to sponsors and will discourage them from seeking it. </p>
<p>FDA believes that the provision for terminating IND's that have been on inactive 
  status for 5 years or more is reasonable to permit the agency to focus its resources 
  upon clinical investigations that are actually being conducted and to keep government 
  records current. Moreover, the termination procedure in ß 312.44 is not automatic: 
  under the procedure, the sponsor has an opportunity to respond to an agency 
  proposal to terminate an IND with an explanation of why it should continue on 
  inactive status. Finally, FDA does not believe sponsors will be adversely affected 
  by termination of an IND that has long been inactive, both because the termination 
  of an IND does not preclude a sponsor from proposing new studies in the future 
  under another IND, and because the agency has, in the NDA Rewrite final rule, 
  amended ß 314.430 governing the disclosure of information in a terminated IND 
  to assure the continued confidentiality of trade secret, confidential commercial, 
  and financial information.</p>
<h3>Meetings (ß 312.47) </h3>
<p>117. Comments agreed with FDA's view that meetings between a sponsor and the 
  agency are frequently useful in resolving questions and issues raised during 
  the course of a clinical investigation. Noting, however, that under current 
  practice there is sometimes a delay of several months in scheduling meetings, 
  comments urged that meetings be held promptly after a request is submitted. 
  Also, one comment urged that advance written information in support of a meeting 
  should be kept to a minimum, and that requests for such information should balance 
  the sponsor's costs in preparing the material against the expected results. 
</p>
<p>The agency agrees that sponsors should not be asked to prepare and submit more 
  information in advance of a meeting than is needed to ensure a productive exchange 
  of views at the meeting. This principle does not mean, however, that the amount 
  of advance information can or should always be kept to a bare minimum. To the 
  contrary, the successful conclusion of many meetings may demand a considerable 
  investment of time and resources in developing background information. This 
  is especially true for meetings such as an end-of-Phase 2 conference, whose 
  primary purpose is to evaluate the adequacy and significance of data developed 
  by the sponsor. </p>
<p>FDA also agrees that meetings are most useful if held promptly after requests 
  for them are submitted and after the necessary advance information has been 
  submitted. The agency will make every effort to schedule such meetings as early 
  as is feasible and to the extent that agency resources permit. </p>
<p>118. One comment requested that the final regulation specifically authorize 
  and encourage "pre-IND" meetings, i.e., meetings between sponsors and FDA prior 
  to the actual submission of an IND. The comment contended that such meetings 
  are often needed to answer questions about technical requirements for an IND 
  and may be essential for planning a clinical study. </p>
<p>The final rule identifies two specific points during the drug development process 
  when meetings between a sponsor and FDA can be particularly useful and productive: 
  (a) at the end of Phase 2; and (b) at the end of Phase 3, but prior to submission 
  of a marketing application. FDA has codified those two meetings because they 
  are exceedingly valuable to both agency reviewers and sponsors and because they 
  are useful for a vast majority of IND's. Although "pre-IND" meetings may be 
  useful for a particular case, FDA does not believe their utility will be so 
  generalized as to warrant separate codification. The agency notes, however, 
  that individual sponsors may request such meetings under ß 312.47(a) as the 
  need may arise. FDA encourages such meetings to the extent that they aid in 
  the evaluation of the drug and associated scientific issues. </p>
<p>119. Two comments contended that many NDA approvals are delayed by questions 
  and concerns about manufacturing and control information. The comments recommended 
  that FDA expand the list of subjects for "pre-NDA" meetings to include these 
  kinds of technical issues. </p>
<p>FDA has no objection to sponsors raising for discussion at "pre-NDA" meetings 
  technical problems relating to the chemistry, manufacturing, and control segment 
  of the marketing application. FDA has revised the final rule to make clearer 
  FDA's willingness to discuss these and other technical matters at such meetings. 
</p>
<p>Sponsors should also be reminded that the NDA final rule (ß 314.50(d)(1)(iv)) 
  has established a procedure specifically authorizing the early submission and 
  review of chemistry, manufacturing, and control information. Under this procedure, 
  applicants may submit the chemistry, manufacturing, and control part of the 
  marketing application 90 to 120 days in advance of the rest of the application. 
  This procedure may frequently be superior to the "pre-NDA" meeting as a means 
  of resolving the highly technical issues involved. </p>
<h3>Dispute Resolution (312.48) </h3>
<p>120. The IND Rewrite proposal contained a new formal appeals process for resolving 
  disputes between FDA and sponsors. The appeals process was first outlined in 
  the proposed NDA Rewrite and was more fully described in a publicly available 
  FDA Staff Manual Guide 4820.5. Under that process, drug firms could appeal requests 
  by agency employees for specific additional studies or information, requests 
  to modify or delay a study, or unfavorable agency responses to sponsors' requests 
  for waivers or special technical approaches to scientific problems. The procedure 
  became available for use for both IND's and NDA's through issuance of the Staff 
  Manual Guide noted above. </p>
<p>FDA first received adverse comments on this appeals procedure in the NDA Rewrite 
  rulemaking, and these objections were reiterated in the IND Rewrite rulemaking. 
  The comments suggested that the appeals process was, on the one hand, too complex 
  for resolving minor administrative and procedural disputes, and, on the other 
  hand, too inflexible to handle efficiently major scientific and medical disputes, 
  which, according to the comments, should be referable as a matter of right to 
  one of FDA's standing advisory committees. </p>
<p>FDA in general agreed with these observations about the shortcomings of the 
  formal appeals mechanism. The agency's view of the deficiencies of the process 
  was underlined by the fact that the appeals process was rarely used successfully 
  during the more than 1 year it was effective. For these reasons, in issuing 
  the NDA Rewrite final rule, FDA abandoned the formal process in favor of a more 
  comprehensive approach to dispute resolution. This approach entailed establishing 
  a range of procedural alternatives, each tailored to a specific kind of dispute, 
  and then referring sponsors to whichever of the available procedural mechanisms 
  was best suited to the particular matter under discussion. FDA now concludes 
  that a comparable dispute resolution mechanism should be adopted for the IND 
  process and ß 312.48 of this final rule has been revised accordingly. </p>
<p>There are three chief components of this new appeals process: (1) The use of 
  an ombudsman to deal with administrative and procedural problems; (2) the codification 
  of an informal process for resolving scientific disputes; and (3) the increased 
  use of outside scientific advisers, when feasible and appropriate. </p>
<p>First, the final rule encourages sponsors to seek the help of a designated 
  "ombudsman" to resolve administrative and procedural disputes arising during 
  the course of an investigation. The function of the ombudsman is to investigate 
  the facts and to facilitate a timely and equitable resolution of the issue. 
  Appropriate issues to raise with the ombudsman include resolving difficulties 
  in scheduling meetings, obtaining timely replies to inquires, and obtaining 
  timely completion of pending reviews. Details on the role of the ombudsman are 
  set forth in a publicly available FDA Staff Manual Guide 4820.7. (Other elements 
  of the new dispute resolution mechanism are described in the revised FDA Staff 
  Manual Guide, "Appeals Process: Resolving Scientific Disputes Over Drug Applications" 
  (CDB 4820.5).) </p>
<p>The second component of the dispute resolution mechanism emphasizes the value 
  of informal communications between sponsors and DFA as the best means of resolving 
  important technical and scientific issues quickly and amicably. If scientific 
  or medical disputes arise, the final rule provides that applicants should first 
  discuss the matter directly with the responsible reviewing officials. If these 
  discussions do not resolve the matter, applicants may request an informal meeting 
  with the appropriate reviewers and supervisors. Alternatively, disputes may 
  be appropriately discussed at a more formal, "pre-NDA" or "end-of-Phase 2" meeting. 
</p>
<p>Finally, the new procedures recognize the advantages of utilizing the advice 
  of outside scientific experts in the dispute resolution process, where it is 
  practicable and feasible to do so. Section 312.48(c)(3) of the final rule therefore 
  provides that, in requesting a meeting with the agency to resolve a scientific 
  or medical dispute, sponsors may suggest that FDA seek the advice of outside 
  experts, in which case FDA may, in its discretion, invite to the meeting one 
  or more of its advisory committee members or other agency consultants, as designated 
  by the agency. The applicant is also free to bring its own consultants. </p>
<p>Section 312.48(c)(3) of the final rule also provides that, for major scientific 
  and medical policy issues not resolved by informal meetings, FDA may on its 
  own initiative refers the matter to one of its standing advisory committees 
  for its consideration and recommendations. Although ß 312.48 does not provide 
  the right to advisory committee review requested by some comments, FDA does 
  intend to integrate outside experts more fully into the IND portion of the drug 
  approval process. FDA believes that providing applicants a right to advisory 
  committee review for any disputed issue is impractical from the standpoint of 
  the potential number of controversial issues and the relatively infrequent number 
  of advisory committee meetings. Moreover, utilization of outside advisory committees 
  is committed to the discretion of the agency, and not properly delegated to 
  members of the public. Nonetheless, by involving individual advisory committee 
  members or consultants in the dispute resolution process on a more informal 
  basis, FDA believes that the goal of interacting with the scientific community 
  can be achieved without the delays, resouces, and scheduling problems associated 
  with full advisory committee involvement. </p>
<h2><em>Responsibilities of Clinical Investigators and Sponsors </em></h2>
<p>122. As noted in the introduction, the proposed IND Rewrite was issued on the 
  assumption that proposed Part 52 governing the obligations of sponsors and monitors 
  and proposed Part 54 governing the obligation of clinical investigations would 
  be adopted as final rules before, or at the same time as, this final rule. As 
  noted, because those proposals have not been made final, FDA has retained in 
  new Part 312 most of those obligations of investigators and sponsors in existing 
  Part 312 that were to be transferred to in Parts 52 and 54. While in general, 
  the obligations of sponsors, monitors, and clinical investigators are the same 
  as those set forth in the existing IND regulations, in three areas, FDA is adopting 
  minor changes that relate to provisions first proposed in the September 27, 
  1977, and August 8, 1978, proposed rules. These areas are: (a) Obligations assigned 
  to contract research organizations; (b) disclosure of study audits conducted 
  by the sponsor; and (c) the standard for disqualifying clinical investigators. 
  These changes apply to investigational new animal drugs as well as new drugs 
  for human use. They will be discussed in turn. </p>
<h2><em>Contract Research Organizations </em></h2>
<p>The agency is adopting certain provisions relating to contract research organizations 
  based on proposed Part 52 (see proposed ß 52.5 at 42 FR 49623). A contract research 
  organization is an independent organization that contracts with a sponsor of 
  a clinical investigation to assume one or more obligations of the sponsor for 
  the conduct of a clinical study. Use of contract research organizations has 
  grown increasingly common in the United States. Adoption of these provisions 
  represents a regulatory acknowledgment of this common practice. </p>
<p>The final rule: (1) Defines the term "contract research organization" (ß 312.3); 
  (2) authorizes a sponsor to transfer any or all of the sponsor's obligations 
  for the conduct of the clinical study to a contract research organization (ß 
  312.52(a)); (3) requires that the sponsor keep a written statement that outlines 
  what obligations have been so transferred (ß 312.52(a)); and (4) describes the 
  responsibilities of both the sponsor and the contract research organization, 
  once having made such a transfer (ß 312.52 (a) and (b)). In addition, the final 
  rule requires that the sponsor disclose in the IND whether any obligations have 
  been transferred to a contract research organization, and, if so, that the sponsor 
  list the obligations transferred. Finally, 21 CFR Part 314 is amended by adding 
  new ß 314.50(d)(5)(x) to conform Part 314 to Part 312 with respect to contract 
  research organizations. </p>
<p>The agency is adopting identical changes concerning contract research organizations 
  in the investigational new animal drug (INAD) and new animal drug application 
  (NADA) regulations. </p>
<p>A number of persons commented on the provisions pertaining to contract research 
  oganizations when proposed Part 52 was issued. A summary of these comments and 
  the agency's responses follow: </p>
<p>i. Several comments objected to the proposed requirements that obligations 
  transferred to a contract research organization be specifically described, stating 
  that a general transfer of all obligations should be allowed. These comments 
  argued that because a sponsor is often unable to describe specifically each 
  aspect of an obligation transferred before a study begins, it would be unrealistic 
  to have those obligations that were not specifically described considered not 
  to have been transferred at all. </p>
<p>FDA agrees that when a sponsor transfers all its responsibility for the conduct 
  of a study, a statement of this general transfer of obligations should be allowed. 
  The regulation has been revised accordingly. Therefore, when a sponsor transfers 
  all obligations regarding the conduct of a clinical study to a contract research 
  organization, the written statement may indicate that a general transfer has 
  been made and need not enumerate the specific obligations transferred. However, 
  in other cases, i.e., when less than all obligations are transferred, specificity 
  in describing the transfer of obligations of a sponsor to a contract research 
  organization is essential. In such cases, because a contract research organization 
  is required to comply with the specific regulation applicable to any obligations 
  it assumes for a sponsor, a sponsor must be able to set forth specifically each 
  obligation that it expects the contract research organization to assume. The 
  specification of the transferred obligations ensures that the contract research 
  organization knows exactly what its obligations are before beginning a clinical 
  investigation. </p>
<p>While a contract research organization may assume any or all of the sponsor's 
  responsibility for the conduct of a study, it should be emphasized that the 
  transfer does not relieve the sponsor from responsibility for the quality and 
  integrity of any data derived from the investigation that are submitted to FDA. 
</p>
<p>ii. One comment requested an explicit statement to the effect that if a contract 
  research organization is subjected to administrative action, the sponsor will 
  not also be subject to this same administrative action if the sponsor complied 
  with all applicable requirements governing the transfer of obligations. </p>
<p>The agency considers such explicit language unnecessary because the written 
  statement identifying what obligations have been transferred will clearly fix 
  the individual sponsor/contract research organization responsibilities. The 
  agency may, therefore, initiate action based upon failure to comply with a regulatory 
  obligation against only the party that has assumed responsibility for, but has 
  not fulfilled, a particular obligation. The agency does not contemplate taking 
  administrative action against a sponsor based solely upon the failure of a contract 
  research organization to perform obligations that have been transferred to it 
  by the sponsor. Sponsors should, therefore, take special care that transferred 
  obligations are described clearly. </p>
<p>iii. One comment asked whether the name of the specific monitor within the 
  contract research organization must be submitted to FDA, along with the name 
  and address of the contract research organization. </p>
<p>The name of the monitor is required to be submitted. See ß 312.23(a)(1)vi) 
  in this final rule. </p>
<h2><em>Disclosure of Study Audits </em></h2>
<p>Proposed Part 52 would have required that a monitor designated by the sponsor 
  visit investigators periodically to, among other things, audit case report forms 
  against individual subject records to assure the accuracy and completeness of 
  the forms (see proposed ß 52.20(b) at 42 FR 49623, 49624). While the agency 
  believes that such audits are extremely important, it has concluded that it 
  should not compel such reviews by regulation. </p>
<p>Rather, the agency has concluded that it should only require that a sponsor, 
  in its submission to the agency of a report of a clinical investigation, state 
  whether the investigator's subject records were audited or reviewed in the course 
  of monitoring a clinical investigation. The agency is adding new ß 314.50(a)(5)(xi) 
  as a necessary conforming amendment to Part 314. The agency is also making an 
  appropriate change to the NADA regulations by adding a new ß 514.1(b)(8)(ix). 
</p>
<p>As noted above, although FDA has not made the auditing of subject records mandatory 
  in this final rule, FDA concludes that it should know whether such a review 
  has, in fact, been conducted. Knowledge that a sponsor has audited subject records 
  may affect the detail with which FDA conducts its own inspection of the supporting 
  data. Morever, in those cases where an agency inspection is not conducted, e.g., 
  in some foreign countries, whether the sponsor has audited the study is an important 
  factor to be considered in evaluating the study. Thus, FDA believes that disclosure 
  of which studies have been audited will significantly improve the efficiency 
  of the agency's clinical investigator inspection program while representing 
  a minimal additional burden on study sponsors. </p>
<h2><em>Disqualification of Clinical Investigators </em></h2>
<p>123. The agency is retaining all the current standards and procedures governing 
  disqualification of clinical investigators, with only one modification. The 
  existing regulations permit the agency to disqualify an investigator on a finding 
  that "the investigator has repeatedly or deliberately failed to comply with 
  the conditions of the exempting regulations * * * or has repeatedly or deliberately 
  submitted false information to the sponsor of an investigation and has failed 
  to furnish adequate assurance that the conditions of the exemption will be met 
  * * * " (ß 312.1 (c)(2)) (emphasis added). This final rule deletes the provision 
  allowing a clinical investigator to avoid disqualifications through the submisson 
  of "adequate assurances" of future compliance. </p>
<p>This action is based on proposed Part 54, which would have similarly limited 
  the grounds for disqualification (see proposed Part 54, Subpart K, at 43 FR 
  35227). Under the 1978 proposal, no provision for the submission of assurances 
  was included whereby an investigator could avoid disqualification if the other 
  criteria for disqualification were met. FDA received no comments on this approach. 
</p>
<p>Based on its more than 20 years of experience with the clinical investigator 
  disqualification procedures, the agency believes that the disqualification procedure 
  will operate more effectively and efficiently if it is limited to objective 
  questions about whether there have been violations of FDA's regulations. The 
  more subjective question of when assurances of future compliance are adequate 
  should be addressed independently of the hearing proceeding. Under the procedures 
  adopted in this final rule, assurances may be presented at several stages of 
  a disqualification proceeding: (1) When the agency initiates a disqualification 
  action, (2) at the informal conference with the Center for Drugs and Biologics 
  offered before any hearing, (3) during the negotiations on a consent agreement, 
  and (4) after an investigator has been disqualified, as part of the efforts 
  to obtain reinstatement. See ß 312.70 of this rule and the guidelines for reinstating 
  the eligibility of clinical investigators to receive investigational articles, 
  announced in the <i>Federal Register</i> of November 19, 1982 (47 FR 52228). 
  Deletion of the submission of "adequate assurances" as a ground for avoiding 
  disqualification will affect only proceedings for which a notice of opportunity 
  for hearing is issued after the effective date of this rule. </p>
<p>FDA acknowledges that proposed Part 54 contained additional criteria for clinical 
  investigator disqualification that are not being adopted in this final rule. 
  These criteria related to the significance of the regulatory violation; i.e., 
  whether the violations adversely affected the validity of the study or the rights 
  or safety of test subjects. The 1978 proposal also provided that the disqualification 
  sanction would not be used if other lesser regulatory actions would be adequate. 
</p>
<p>FDA believes that these criteria are so subjective as to make them extremely 
  difficult to apply fairly in disqualification proceedings. The agency emphasizes, 
  however, that the agency retains discretion on whether to initiate an action 
  to disqualify a clinical investigator, and that the Commissioner will exercise 
  that discretion and not disqualify an investigator if the violations are insignificant, 
  or if lesser sanctions would be adequate. </p>
<p>124. Several comments received on proposed Part 54 questioned FDA's authority 
  under the act to disqualify clinical investigators. Because these coments are 
  relevant to the disqualification procedures that are described both in the existing 
  regulation and in this final rule, they are summarized and discussed below. 
  One comment argued that none of the sections of the act that FDA cited in the 
  preamble to proposed Part 54, that is, sections 701(a), 505(i), and 507(d), 
  explicitly provides for or even suggests disqualification. Two comments suggested 
  that the unsuccessful efforts of Congress to enact legislation to grant the 
  agency explicit authority to disqualify investigators implies that FDA lacks 
  authority now to disqualify clinical investigators. </p>
<p>FDA believes that the agency clearly has authority to disqualify clinical investigators 
  that violate FDA's regulations. A thorough discussion of this authority is found 
  in the preamble to proposed Part 52 (43 FR 35221). FDA believes it is unnecessary 
  to restate that discussion here. In sum, although the concept of disqualification 
  is not explicitly mentioned in the act, the Supreme Court in Weinbergerv. Bentex 
  Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 412 U.S. 645, 653 (1973) has recognized that FDA has 
  authority that "is implicit in the regulatory scheme, not spelled out in haec 
  verba" in the statute. As stated in Morrow v. Clayton, 326 F.2d 36, 44 (10th 
  Cir. 1963): </p>
<p>[I]t is a fundamental principle of administrative law that the powers of an 
  administrative agency are not limited to those expressly granted by the [ir] 
  statutes, but include, also, all of the powers that may be fairly implied therefrom. 
</p>
<p>See Mourning v. Family Publications Service Inc., 411 U.S. 356 (1973) and National 
  Petroleum Refiners Association v. FTC, 482, F.2d 672 (D.C. Cir. 1973). See also 
  Weinberger v. Hynson, Westcott & Dunning, Inc., 412 U.S. 609 (1973); National 
  Nutritional Foods Ass'n v. Weinberger, 512 F.2d 688, cert denied, 423 U.S. 827 
  (1975); United States v. Nova Scotia Food Products Corp., 568 F.2d 246-248 (2d 
  Cir. 1977); American Frozen Food Institute v. Mathews 413 F. Supp. 548 (D.D.C. 
  1976) aff'd per curiam, 555 F. 2d 1059 (D.C. Cir. 1977); National Confectioners 
  Ass'n v. Califano, 569 F.2d 690 (D.C. Cir. 1978); National Ass'n of Pharmaceutical 
  Manufacturers v. FDA, 637 F.2d 877 (2d Cir. 1981). </p>
<p>Congressional inaction on proposed legislation that would state expressly an 
  agency's authority to act does not support an inference that the agency lacks 
  implicit authority to act under existing legislation. Red Lion Broadcasting 
  Co. v. FCC, 395 U.S. 367, 381-382 n. 11 (1969). See also Leist v. Simplot, 638 
  F.2d 283, 318 (2d Cir. 1980), affirmed sub nom. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner 
  & Smith v. Curran, 456 U.S. 353 (1982). </p>
<p>The agency concludes it has ample authority for the promulgation of procedures 
  that govern the disqualification of an investigator of any FDA-regulated product 
  who fails to carry out the requirements of these regulations. </p>
<p>125. The statement of clinical investigator responsibilities in this final 
  rule is essentially the same as that contained in former ß 312.1 with the exceptions 
  noted above. However, in the former regulation, as noted below, clinical investigator 
  responsibilities were described in forms (Forms FD-1572 and FD-1573) that were 
  signed by the investigator and obtained by the sponsor. While FDA believes that 
  the forms adequately stated the investigator's responsibilities, the agency 
  has concluded that a clearer approach is to set forth investigator responsibilities 
  in the body of the text (see ß 312.60 et seq.). </p>
<p>126. FDA recognizes that some may view the decision by the Ninth Circuit Court 
  of Appeals in the United States v. Smith, 740 F.2d 734 (9th Cir. 1984), which 
  involved criminal charges against a clinical investigator, as raising questions 
  about the agency's authority to promulgate enforceable regulations on the obligations 
  of clinical investigators. After considering the court's opinion, FDA concludes 
  that it has ample authority to issue such regulations. The agency points out 
  that the court in Smith noted that under the regulation then in effect (former 
  21 CFR 312.1(c)), FDA could conduct an administrative hearing to revoke an investigator's 
  entitlement to work with investigational new drugs. </p>
<p>Moreover, FDA believes that both the language of the statute and its legislative 
  history demonstrate that issuance of this final rule is within the scope of 
  authority delegated to the Secretary by Congress under sections 505(i) and 701(a) 
  of the act (21 U.S.C. 355(i) and 371(a)). The statutory language makes clear 
  Congress' intent that clinical investigators be subject to section 505(i) of 
  the act, and that they be required to maintain records. The stated purpose of 
  section 505(i) is to make investigational drugs available "solely for investigational 
  use by experts qualified by scientific training and experience to investigate 
  the safety and effectiveness of drugs." The experts referred to are, in fact, 
  the clinical investigators covered by this final rule, who perform the tests 
  for which the investigational exemption exists. Section 505(i) of the act states 
  that the "Secretary shall promulgate [exempting] regulations * * * [for] drugs 
  intended soley for investigational use by experts * * *." Thus, it does not 
  contain any restriction on who may be subject to such regulations. </p>
<p>The plain meaning of the statute demonstrates that Congress intended the Secretary 
  to have the discretionary authority to impose conditions on investigational 
  drug use in addition to those conditions specified as examples in the statute. 
  The Secretary was explicitly authorized by Congress to impose "other conditions 
  relating to the protection of the public health" by this part of the statute. 
  21 U.S.C. 355(i). </p>
<p>The legislative history of section 505(i) of the act also demonstrates that 
  Congress intended the Secretary to require clinical investigators to maintain 
  investigational drug study records. Before passage of the Drug Amendments of 
  1962 (Pub. L. 87-781), Congress was aware that FDA had proposed regulations 
  on new drugs for investigational use, including the requirement that investigators 
  prepare and maintain records. See 27 FR 7990 (1962); 108 Congressional Record 
  17308 (1962) (remarks of Senator Eastland). The regulations were promulgated 
  in 1963 (28 FR 179; January 8, 1963) and were codified in ß 312.1. The House 
  Committee Report specifically approved the proposed regulations and made clear 
  what section 505(i) of the act was intended to accomplish. </p>
<p>[This section] provides a firm legal basis for greater controls of the distribution 
  of new drugs for investigational use. Existing law directs the Secretary to 
  promulgate regulations providing for exempting new drugs from preclearance for 
  safety on condition that they are labeled and intended soley for investigational 
  use by experts qualified by scientific training and experience to investigate 
  the safety of new drugs. * * * These investigators are required to maintain 
  records on the investigation. The Department has proposed strengthening regulations 
  to provide greater safeguards in investigational drug use. The bill approves 
  strengthening regulations and provides that the regulations may require, among 
  other things, * * * (3) the establishment and maintenance of adequate records, 
  * * * to facilitate the evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of the new 
  drug, when an application is filed * * *. [This section also] amends the prohibited-acts 
  section of existing law, section 301(e), 21 U.S.C. ß 331(e), to forbid the failure 
  to establish or maintain any required record, either on an investigational use 
  of drugs or on clinical experience. * * * </p>
<p>H. Rept. 2464, 87th Cong., 2d Sess. 9-10 (1962) (emphasis added). </p>
<p>FDA views as unreasonable an interpretation of section 505(i) of the act that 
  excludes regulation of clinical investigation from the public health protections 
  provided by the section. A clinical investigator who falsified or destroyed 
  original records of a drug study, and who then submitted false records to a 
  sponsor, would clearly cause the sponsor to maintain false records and to make 
  false reports to FDA. Moreover, were an investigator not required to maintain 
  his or her own records (as distinct from those maintained by the sponsor), FDA 
  would in those cases frequently be precluded from even discovering the falseness 
  of the reports and would then review and perhaps approve drug products on the 
  basis of false data. </p>
<p>Thus, section 505(i) provides ample authority for FDA to adopt these regulations, 
  which have the force and effect of law. </p>
<h3>Investigator Statement (ß 312.53(c)) </h3>
<p>127. Proposed and final ß 312.53(c)(1) transforms the investigator statement 
  (Form FDA-1572) from a detailed description of the responsibilities of all parties 
  to the investigation into a brief form that identifies the regulations governing 
  conduct of a clinical investigation and commits the investigator to comply with 
  these requirements. One comment expressed regret at this change, claiming that, 
  as proposed, the clinical investigator would no longer have available a concise 
  written statement of his or her obligations. The comment suggested that the 
  regulations explicitly require the sponsor to provide the investigator with 
  a written summary of all applicable responsibilities before the investigation 
  begins. </p>
<p>FDA agrees with the comments on the usefulness of providing investigators with 
  a written summary of their responsibilities in conducting a clinical investigation. 
  The agency has therefore prepared an informational leaflet that summarizes investigator 
  responsibilities imposed under this part and other relevant requirements of 
  FDA's regulations. This leaflet can be obtained from the Legislative, Professional, 
  and Consumer Affairs Branch (HFN-365), Center for Drugs and Biologics, Food 
  and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857 (301-295-8012). 
</p>
<p>Because FDA is making available a written summary of investigator responsibilities, 
  the agency does not believe that this final rule should require sponsor distribution 
  of similar materials to investigators. </p>
<p>128. Section 312.53(c) requires that the investigator statement identify the 
  name and address of the IRB that is responsible for review and approval of the 
  investigator's study. One comment suggested that it would be inappropriate and 
  impracticable to include this information in the investigator statement. </p>
<p>FDA disagrees with this comment. An investigator is responsible for obtaining 
  IRB approval of a clinical investigation before a study may be initiated, and 
  for keeping the sponsor informed of such IRB approval and subsequent IRB actions 
  concerning the study. FDA does not believe it is a significant additional burden 
  to ask the investigator to inform the sponsor of the IRB's name and address. 
  The cooperation of investigators in this matter will help the sponsor to meet 
  its responsibility to keep the agency informed of the identity of all reviewing 
  IRB's. </p>
<p>129. One comment asked that the proposed commitment of the investigator to 
  "report to the sponsor immediately any unsuspected or serious side effects that 
  occur in the course of the investigation(s)" (proposed ß 312.53(c)(1)(vi)(e)) 
  be revised to require the reporting of any "unexpected or serious side effects." 
</p>
<p>FDA has revised ß 312.53(c)(1)(vi)(e) to require the investigator to report 
  adverse experiences in accordance with the provisions of ß 312.64. Section 312.64 
  requires an investigator promptly to report to the sponsor any adverse effect 
  that may reasonably be regarded as caused by, or probably caused by, the drug. 
  If the adverse effect is alarming, the regulation requires the investigator 
  to report immediately. These provisions are taken almost verbatim from former 
  ß 312.1. </p>
<p>130. A comment objected to the provision in ß 312.53(c)(3) that would require 
  the sponsor to obtain a clinical plan from each participating investigator. 
  The comment stated its assumption that the sponsor is ordinarily responsible 
  for developing the plan, and that the sponsor normally provides the plan to 
  participating investigators rather than the other way around. Another comment 
  contended that the use of the term "clinical plan" is confusing, as it usually 
  refers to the overall plan of the sponsor. The comment suggested using "protocol" 
  or "clinical protocol" instead. </p>
<p>FDA agrees that the use of the term "protocol" alone may be less confusing 
  and has revised ß 312.53(c)(3) of the final rule accordingly. </p>
<p>The final rule is not intended to designate whether the investigator or the 
  sponsor originate the protocol under which a study will be conducted. The inclusion 
  of the protocol in the information given by the investigator to the sponsor 
  simply provides added assurance that there has been a "meeting of the minds" 
  between sponsor and investigator on the appropriate course for the study. </p>
<h3>Informing Investigators (ß 312.55) </h3>
<p>131. One comment contended that the intended relationship between the investigator 
  notification requirements of ß 312.32 dealing with notifying investigators of 
  IND safety reports and those outlined in ß 312.55(b) dealing with important 
  safety information is unclear. The comment contended that ß 312.55 should not 
  require more with respect to notification than is required under the IND safety 
  report requirement. The comment observed that proposed ß 312.55(b) can be read 
  to require that safety information other than that contained in the safety reports 
  be conveyed to investigators on an immediate basis. If that is what was intended, 
  the comment asked the agency to specify what other information should be conveyed 
  to investigators and what need there is for conveying that additional information. 
</p>
<p>FDA did not intend that ß 312.55(b) differ from ß 312.32 with respect to investigator 
  notification of important safety information. FDA has revised ß 312.55(b) to 
  clarify that important safety information shall be relayed in safety reports 
  to the investigator in accordance with ß 312.32. </p>
<h3>Review of Ongoing Investigations (ß 312.56) </h3>
<p>132. Proposed ß 212.56 directed sponsors to "evaluate the evidence relating 
  to safety and effectiveness of the drug as it is obtained from the investigators." 
  One comment claimed that, since it is not ordinarily possible to evaluate evidence 
  of effectiveness without breaking the code for blinded studies, the preamble 
  to the final regulation should make clear that, for blinded studies, evidence 
  is not considered "obtained" until the code is broken. </p>
<p>The agency views ß 312.56(c) as requiring a sponsor to: (1) Immediately review 
  all new data received from an investigator regarding the safety of the investigational 
  drug, (2) periodically evaluate all data received from all investigators regarding 
  the safety of the drug, and (3) periodically evaluate the data received from 
  all investigators who have completed their portions of the investigation to 
  ascertain whether the drug is proving to be effective for the intended use. 
  As thus interpreted, a sponsor should not have to "break the code" of a blinded 
  study to evaluate evidence relating solely to the effectiveness of the investigational 
  drug. </p>
<p>133. If an investigation is discontinued for safety reasons, ß 312.56(d) (ß 
  312.56(c) as proposed) requires the sponsor to notify all reviewing IRB's of 
  the discontinuance. One comment asked whether the sponsor's obligation would 
  be limited to notifying only those IRB's reviewing studies involving the specific 
  dosage level and dosage form of the problem drug, or whether the obligation 
  would extend to notifying all IRB's reviewing studies of the drug at any dosage 
  level or in any dosage form. Two other comments suggested that the responsibility 
  for notifying an IRB should belong with the investigator, not the sponsor. </p>
<p>The notification requirement in ß 312.56(d) applies to all IRB's reviewing 
  clinical investigations with the investigational drug. The notification provides 
  added assurance that reviewing IRB's will be promptly informed of the most serious 
  problems relating to their review. </p>
<p>With respect to the comments suggesting that the investigator, not the sponsor, 
  has the responsibility for IRB notification, FDA recognizes that sponsors usually 
  do not have direct contact with IRB's. FDA believes, however, that under extraordinary 
  circumstances, such as when a sponsor discontinues a study because an adverse 
  drug effect presents an unreasonable and significant risk to subjects, it is 
  not unreasonable to ask the sponsor to notify all reviewing IRB's of the discontinuance. 
  Direct contact between the sponsor and IRB in this situation will permit an 
  IRB to obtain directly from the sponsor all the facts surrounding the sponsor's 
  decision to discontinue the study, information that may not be available from 
  the investigator. </p>
<p>134. Under ß 312.56(d) (ß 312.56(c) as proposed), if a sponsor determines that 
  its investigational drug presents an unreasonable and significant risk to subjects, 
  the sponsor is required to discontinue the investigation as soon as possible, 
  and in no event later than 5 working days after making the determination. One 
  comment agreed that the 5-working-day time limit should apply to the entry of 
  new subjects to the investigation, but argued that the provision should be revised 
  to permit the investigator to take participating subjects off the drug "in a 
  fashion consistent with the health and safety of the subjects." </p>
<p>Once a determination has been made that an investigational drug presents an 
  unreasonable and significant risk to subjects -- the trigger for discontinuance 
  -- the agency believes it is reasonable to expect sponsors to ensure that subjects 
  are taken off the drug as quickly as possible. FDA believes that, as a general 
  rule, 5 working days is sufficient time for patients to be taken off the drug 
  in a fashion consistent with their health and safety. If, in the sponsor's view, 
  there are extraordinary circumstances dictating that some subjects be continued 
  on the drug, FDA will be willing on a case-by-case basis to discuss an extension 
  of the 5-day time limit. </p>
<h3>Inspection of Sponsor's Records and Reports (ß 312.58) </h3>
<p>135. Proposed ß 312.58(a) would require the sponsor to make available for FDA 
  inspection and copying the records and reports that are required to be maintained 
  by the sponsor under Part 312 and other applicable regulations. One comment 
  argued that reports made by a sponsor's monitor should not be subject to this 
  provision because monitoring, as a quality assurance function, will work most 
  efficiently if it is not subject to government audit. In this way, the comment 
  contended, monitors' reports will be more candid and critical, and thus have 
  more value to the sponsor in assuring that appropriate corrective actions are 
  undertaken as needed. </p>
<p>FDA believes it should retain the authority to inspect records and reports 
  relating to a sponsor's monitoring of clinical investigations under Part 312. 
  Access to these materials helps the agency both to confirm that monitoring is 
  actually taking place and to determine the nature of such monitoring. FDA also 
  is not persuaded that the prospect of agency inspection of monitoring records 
  and reports should significantly influence monitors in recording their observations 
  and recommendations. </p>
<p>As proposed, ß 312.58(a) would have required sponsors to make available to 
  FDA's inspectors "reports required to be maintained under this part and under 
  other applicable parts of this chapter." This might be read as not requiring 
  a sponsor to make available a record or report that is not specifically enumerated 
  in the regulations, even though it is clearly related to the conduct of a clinical 
  investigation. To clarify agency intent, FDA has revised ß 312.58(a) in the 
  final rule to give the agency explicit authority to inspect and copy any record 
  or report relating to a clinical investigation conducted under Part 312. </p>
<h3>Imports (ß 312.110(a)) </h3>
<p>136. The proposal provided that an investigational drug may be imported if 
  it complies with Part 312 and the consignee of the shipment is either the sponsor 
  of the study or is an investigator named in the IND. One comment noted that 
  a domestic agent may act as intermediary for a foreign sponsor, receiving the 
  drug directly from the foreign sponsor, and monitoring and controlling its distribution. 
  The comment suggested that shipment directly to this class of consignees be 
  made expressly allowable. </p>
<p>The agency has no objection to the importation of a drug into the United States 
  going through an agent of a foreign sponsor provided: (a) The intermediary is 
  identified in the IND and (b) the IND describes what, if any, actions the intermediary 
  will take with respect to the imported drug (e.g., repacking or relabeling). 
  FDA has revised the regulation accordingly. </p>
<p>137. One comment asked that FDA give sponsors guidance on the procedures to 
  be followed in importing a new drug for use in laboratory research or for tests 
  in vitro. </p>
<p>The import into the United States of a drug intended for investigational use 
  in laboratory research animals or tests in vitro must comply with the requirements 
  set forth in proposed and final ß 312.160 governing authorization to ship such 
  drug. This section requires the shipper to ensure that the drug is properly 
  labeled, that due diligence is taken to ensure that the drug is shipped only 
  to experts regularly engaged in conducting tests in animals or in vitro, and 
  that accurate records are kept of the drug's distribution. It should be noted 
  that ß 312.160 only governs compliance with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
  Act; a sponsor may face import requirements under other laws and administered 
  by other agencies, such as laws governing importation of controlled substances. 
</p>
<p>138. One comment suggested that the import provisions of proposed ß 312.110(a) 
  should be revised to allow a sponsor to import an investigational new drug for 
  use as a control in a comparative study involving the sponsor's own drug without 
  requiring a separate IND for the comparison drug. The comment suggested that 
  the importation of the drug could be accommodated by allowing the sponsor to 
  insert all necessary relevant information in the sponsor's existing IND file, 
  thus obviating the need to create a separate IND for the imported drug. </p>
<p>As an administrative convenience and to ensure that information on both the 
  investigational drug and the drug used as an active control are reviewed together, 
  the two drugs should be included in the same IND. The sponsor should, of course, 
  ensure that sufficient information is submitted on the control drug to permit 
  an assessment of the drug's safety for use in the investigation, and to permit 
  the drug to be used as a baseline of effectiveness against which to measure 
  the effectiveness of the principal drug under study. (Sponsors are reminded 
  that when an active treatment control is used, FDA expects such control to be 
  a known effective therapy. See 21 CFR 314.126(b)(2)(iv).) </p>
<h3>Exports (ß 312.110(b)) </h3>
<p>139. Proposed ß 312.110(b)(1) would permit export of an investigational new 
  drug if an IND is in effect for the drug and each person who receives the drug 
  is an investigator named in the application. Several comments contended that, 
  as written, this provision could be interpreted as prohibiting the intra-company 
  export of investigational drugs, a practice which the comment suggested was 
  common under the current regulations. The practice allows a shipment from the 
  United States company to go first to its parent, subsidiary, or affiliate company 
  in a foreign country for final distribution by the foreign affiliate to the 
  clinical investigator. One comment stated that shipping through a foreign affiliate 
  permits the sponsor to save multiple shipping expenses and to ensure proper 
  storage conditions upon receipt. The comment stated its assumption that FDA 
  did not intend to prohibit this practice and urged that the final regulation 
  so state. </p>
<p>The agency has no objection to either a domestic or an export shipment of an 
  investigational drug subject to an IND going through an intermediary on its 
  way to the clinical investigator provided the IND identifies the intermediary 
  and describes what actions, if any, the intermediary will take with respect 
  to the drug. Of course, the IND would still be required to identify and give 
  the qualifications for each participating investigator. </p>
<p>140. One comment questioned the applicability of the IND export provisions 
  to the export of antibiotic drugs. The comment noted that, on its face, the 
  export provisions apply to any investigational new drug including antibiotic 
  drugs. The comment claimed that these provisions could be interpreted to mean 
  that an unapproved antibiotic drug could not be exported except in accordance 
  with the investigational export provisions. The comment claimed that this would 
  be inconsistent with FDA's previously expressed view that the act does not require 
  an IND for the export of an unapproved antibiotic drug intended for use in humans 
  if the standards of section 801(d) of the act (21 U.S.C. 381(d)) are met. The 
  comment asked for clarification of the agency's view in the final regulation. 
</p>
<p>The comment is correct in noting that antibiotic drug products, including investigational 
  antibiotic drug products, may be exported under the provisions of section 801(d) 
  of the act. FDA has added new ß 312.110(b)(4) to state that, notwithstanding 
  the export provisions of the IND regulations, an investigational antibiotic 
  may be exported if its export conforms to the provisions of section 801(d) of 
  the act. </p>
<p>141. It should be noted that, under the recently adopted Drug Exports Amendments 
  Act of 1986, FDA is authorized to approve applications to export unapproved 
  drugs (including biological products). New section 802 of the Federal Food, 
  Drug, and Cosmetic Act and section 351(h)(1)(A) of the Public Health Service 
  Act describe the conditions that a drug firm must satisfy to obtain FDA approval 
  to export unapproved products for commercial marketing abroad. FDA has revised 
  ß 312.110(b) to make clear that the IND export provisions do not preclude the 
  export of products that are approved for export under the new law. </p>
<p>142. In the <i>Federal Register</i> of January 18, 1984 (49 FR 2095), FDA amended 
  the IND regulations to streamline the process by which the agency may authorize 
  the export of investigational new drugs that are not subject to an effective 
  IND. Specifically, these revisions allow the agency to authorize export in two 
  situations: (a) In response to a request submitted by a drug firm containing 
  sufficient information to demonstrate that the drug is appropriate for investigational 
  use, that the drug will be used for investigational purposes only, and that 
  the drug can legally be used by the consignee in the importing country for the 
  proposed investigational use; and (b) in response to a request submitted by 
  an authorized official of the government of the importing country, submitted 
  directly to FDA, that specifies that the government has adequate information 
  about the drug for the proposed use, that the drug will be used for investigational 
  purposes only, and that the drug can legally be used in the importing country. 
  These two provisions have been incorporated into this final rule (ß 312.110(b)(2)). 
</p>
<h3>Foreign Clinical Studies Not Conducted Under an IND (ß 312.120) </h3>
<p>143. One comment noted that a foreign clinical investigation conducted under 
  an IND is required to conform to FDA's current IRB regulations, whereas a foreign 
  study not conducted under an IND is deemed acceptable if it complies with the 
  ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The comment questioned the 
  disparate treatment of these studies and suggested that the final rule should 
  eliminate the distinction between them so that compliance with the ethical principles 
  of the Declaration of Helsinki would meet the ethical requirements for any foreign 
  study, whether conducted under an IND or not.</p>
<p>The distinction referred to in the comment is not a product of the new regulations, 
  but rather carries forward the past requirement under former ß 312.20. FDA believes 
  this distinction is warranted for the following reasons. </p>
<p>First, the agency believes that any study under an IND, wherever it is conducted, 
  should comply with all applicable requirements governing the conduct of clinical 
  studies, including the requirement for institutional review. To exempt foreign 
  studies under an IND from IRB requirements might encourage sponsors to remove 
  clincial studies from the United States to countries with lesser standards of 
  human subject protection. This would clearly not be in the interest of the public 
  health. </p>
<p>While FDA is unwilling to create a different standard for foreign studies under 
  an IND, the agency will accept in support of an IND or marketing application 
  reports of foreign studies that are not under an IND (and not subject to institutional 
  review), provided there are adequate alternative guarantees of human subject 
  protection. This policy is based on a recognition that much important clinical 
  research is conducted throughout the world, which meets the legal and ethical 
  standards of the countries in which it is conducted, but which is carried on 
  without the kind of institutional review required under FDA's requirements. 
  To insist on absolute adherence to FDA's IRB requirements would obligate the 
  agency to reject valid scientific data generated overseas. Thus, ß 312.120 (like 
  its predecessor ß 312.20) permits FDA to accept a foreign study not subject 
  to institutional review, provided the study was conducted in accordance with 
  the Declaration of Helsinki or the laws of the foreign country in which the 
  research was conducted, whichever affords the greater protection of the individual. 
</p>
<p>Finally, FDA notes that ß 56.105 of the IRB regulations permits a waiver of 
  IRB review where that is warranted. Thus, foreign research can be conducted 
  under an IND even where IRB review is not available, provided a waiver from 
  the agency is obtained in advance. </p>
<p>On its own initiative, FDA has revised ß 312.120(b) to make clear that the 
  data submission requirements for foreign studies in paragraph (b) apply not 
  only to foreign studies intended to support an IND, but also to such studies 
  when submitted in support of a marketing application. The revision conforms 
  the final rule to previous agency policy. </p>
<p>144. Proposed and final ß 312.120(b)(3) requires that case records from a foreign 
  study be submitted if FDA so requests. One comment suggested that the laws and 
  regulations of some foreign countries may not permit the submission of case 
  records and urged that the final regulation provide for other means of assuring 
  the validity of information in a foreign study. </p>
<p>FDA understands that a sponsor cannot disclose foreign records that are prohibited 
  from disclosure by foreign law. Nevertheless, if the agency believes that access 
  to records is necessary to verify certain data or to validate the study -- and 
  such records are not available because of foreign law -- the sponsor and FDA 
  will need to agree upon an alternative validating procedure if the agency is 
  to rely on the data. Such alternative validation might entail the verification 
  of data by a foreign drug regulatory body or other mutually agreed on procedure. 
</p>
<p>145. One comment supported FDA's proposals to accept foreign clinical studies 
  in support of IND applications and applications for marketing permits, but urged 
  that the assumption should be that these studies are acceptable unless FDA can 
  demonstrate why the studies are not acceptable. </p>
<p>FDA disagrees with this comment's suggestion that the burden of proof should 
  be on FDA to show why a foreign study is inadequate. As with domestic studies, 
  the burden is on the sponsor to demonstrate that a study is valid. Nevertheless, 
  FDA routinely gives sponsors its reasons for refusing to accept a study, whether 
  foreign or domestic, and that practice will continue. </p>
<p>146. Section 312.120 requires a sponsor who wishes to rely on a foreign clinical 
  study to submit a description of the research facilities used during the study. 
  One comment recommended deleting the requirement, observing that such description 
  is not required for studies under an IND. </p>
<p>FDA disagrees. An assessment of the adequacy of research facilities for a proposed 
  investigation is an important factor in determining the reliability and validity 
  of data generated by a study, wherever the study is conducted. For studies conducted 
  under an IND, this assessment is frequently obtained through on-site inspections 
  of the facilities identified in the IND. However, because of the difficulties 
  in inspecting foreign research facilities and because of the likelihood that 
  FDA will not otherwise be familiar with such facilities, FDA believes it is 
  appropriate to require documentation of the adequacy of foreign facilities. 
  The requirement should not represent a significant burden on sponsors, but will 
  appreciably enhance FDA's review of the quality of foreign studies. </p>
<p>147. One comment recommended that FDA not require a sponsor wishing to rely 
  on a foreign study to submit the names and qualifications of members of that 
  study's reviewing IRB or other independent review committee when such information 
  is not required of a domestic study. </p>
<p>Information about the qualifications of such review committee members is important 
  in assessing the competence of the committee to protect the interests of human 
  subjects. While it is true that the sponsor of a study under an IND is not required 
  to submit the names and qualifications of the members of an independent review 
  committee, the information is routinely obtained through FDA on-site inspections 
  of the IRB. To obtain comparable insight into the quality of institutional review 
  for foreign studies not conducted under an IND, given that inspections of foreign 
  review committees are usually not feasible, FDA believes it is appropriate to 
  ask that the sponsor document the qualifications of the institutional committee 
  members. FDA notes that this provision is not a new requirement, but has been 
  part of FDA's regulations since 1975. </p>
<h3>Availability for Public Disclosure of Data and Information in an IND (ß 312.130) 
</h3>
<p>148. Proposed ß 312.130 provided that the existence of an IND will not be disclosed 
  or acknowledged. One comment urged that this section be revised to state that, 
  unless such public disclosure is clear and a matter of public record, existence 
  of an IND will not be disclosed by FDA without consulting with a sponsor. The 
  comment argued that unless FDA has a clear record of a previous disclosure, 
  the sponsor is most likely to know whether the existence of the IND has been 
  publicly divulged. </p>
<p>FDA's longstanding policy has been not to disclose the existence of an IND 
  unless its existence has previously been disclosed. Where there is any doubt 
  about previous disclosure, the burden is placed on the requestor to demonstrate 
  such disclosure. As this procedure for screening requests has worked well, FDA 
  does not believe the suggested change is needed. </p>
<h3>Drugs for Investigational Use in Laboratory Research Laboratories or In Vitro 
  Tests (ß 312.160) </h3>
<p>149. The proposal provided that if authority to ship a drug for use in laboratory 
  research animals or in vitro is terminated, the person shipping the drug must 
  recall or have destroyed the unused supplies of the drug. One comment contended 
  that there should be no need to destroy supplies that may possibly be in short 
  supply and suggested that the provision be revised to permit disposal of the 
  drug in some other way. </p>
<p>FDA agrees with the comment and has revised the final rule by adding new paragraph 
  (c) to ß 312.160 to permit a shipper of a drug for investigational use in vitro 
  or in research animals to authorize alternative disposition of unused supplies 
  of the investigational drug, once the investigation is ended. The right to provide 
  an alternative disposition is conditioned on the shipper assuring that the unused 
  supplies will not expose humans to risks from the drug, either directly or indirectly.

<h2>Subpart A -- General Provisions </h2>
<h3>ß 312.1 Scope. </h3>
<p>(a) This part contains procedures and requirements governing the use of investigational 
  new drugs, including procedures and requirements for the submission to, and 
  review by, the Food and Drug Administration of investigational new drug applications 
  (IND's). An investigational new drug for which an IND is in effect in accordance 
  with this part is exempt from the premarketing approval requirements that are 
  otherwise applicable and may be shipped lawfully for the purpose of conducting 
  clinical investigations of that drug. </p>
<p>(b) References in this part to regulations in the Code of Federal Regulations 
  are to Chapter I of Title 21, unless otherwise noted. </p>
<h3>ß 312.2 Applicability. </h3>
<p>(a) Applicability. Except as provided in this section, this part applies to 
  all clinical investigations of products that are subject to section 505 or 507 
  of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act or to the licensing provisions of 
  the Public Health Service Act (58 Stat. 632, as amended (42 U.S.C. 201 et seq.)). 
</p>
<p>(b) Exemptions. (1) The clinical investigation of a drug product that is lawfully 
  marketed in the United States is exempt from the requirements of this part if 
  all the following apply: </p>
<p>(i) The investigation is not intended to be reported to FDA as a well-controlled 
  study in support of a new indication for use nor intended to be used to support 
  any other significant change in the labeling for the drug; </p>
<p>(ii) If the drug that is undergoing investigation is lawfully marketed as a 
  prescription drug product, the investigation is not intended to support a significant 
  change in the advertising for the product; </p>
<p>(iii) The investigation does not involve a route of administration or dosage 
  level or use in a patient population or other factor that significantly increases 
  the risks (or decreases the acceptability of the risks) associated with the 
  use of the drug product; </p>
<p>(iv) The investigation is conducted in compliance with the requirements for 
  institutional review set forth in Part 56 and with the requirements for informed 
  consent set forth in Part 50; and </p>
<p>(v) The investigation is conducted in compliance with the requirements of ß 
  312.7. </p>
<p>(2)(i) A clinical investigation involving an in vitro diagnostic biological 
  product listed in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section is exempt from the requirements 
  of this part if (a) it is intended to be used in a diagnostic procedure that 
  confirms the diagnosis made by another, medically established, diagnostic product 
  or procedure and (b) it is shipped in compliance with ß 312.160. </p>
<p>(ii) In accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the following 
  products are exempt from the requirements of this part: (a) blood grouping serum; 
  (b) reagent red blood cells; and (c) anti-human globulin. </p>
<p>(3) A drug intended solely for tests in vitro or in laboratory research animals 
  is exempt from the requirements of this part if shipped in accordance with ß 
  312.160. </p>
<p>(4) FDA will not accept an application for an investigation that is exempt 
  under the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section. </p>
<p>(5) A clinical investigation involving use of a placebo is exempt from the 
  requirements of this part if the investigation does not otherwise require submission 
  of an IND. </p>
<p>(c) Bioavailability studies. The applicability of this part to in vivo bioavailability 
  studies in humans is subject to the provisions of ß 320.31. </p>
<p>(d) Unlabeled indication. This part does not apply to the use in the practice 
  of medicine for an unlabeled indication of a new drug or antibiotic drug product 
  approved under Part 314 or of a licensed biological product. </p>
<p>(e) Guidance. FDA may, on its own initiative, issue guidance on the applicability 
  of this part to particular investigational uses of drugs. On request, FDA will 
  advise on the applicability of this part to a planned clinical investigation. 
</p>
<h3>ß 312.3 Definitions and interpretations. </h3>
<p>(a) The definitions and interpretations of terms contained in section 201 of 
  the act apply to those terms when used in this part: </p>
<p>(b) The following definitions of terms also apply to this part: </p>
<p>"Act" means the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (secs. 201-902, 52 Stat. 
  1040 et seq., as amended (21 U.S.C. 301-392)). </p>
<p>"Clinical investigation" means any experiment in which a drug is administered 
  or dispensed to, or used involving, one or more human subjects. For the purposes 
  of this part, an experiment is any use of a drug except for the use of a marketed 
  drug in the course of medical practice. </p>
<p>"Contract research organization" means a person that assumes, as an independent 
  contractor with the sponsor, one or more of the obligations of a sponsor, e.g., 
  design of a protocol, selection or monitoring of investigations, evaluation 
  of reports, and preparation of materials to be submitted to the Food and Drug 
  Administration. </p>
<p>"FDA" means the Food and Drug Administration. </p>
<p>"IND" means an investigational new drug application. For purposes of this part, 
  "IND" is synonymous with "Notice of Claimed Investigational Exemption for a 
  New Drug." </p>
<p>"Investigational new drug" means a new drug, antibiotic drug, or biological 
  drug that is used in a clinical investigation. The term also includes a biological 
  product that is used in vitro for diagnostic purposes. The terms "investigational 
  drug" and "investigational new drug" are deemed to be synonymous for purposes 
  of this part. </p>
<p>"Investigator" means an individual who actually conducts a clinical investigation 
  (i.e., under whose immediate direction the drug is administered or dispensed 
  to a subject). In the event an investigation is conducted by a team of individuals, 
  the investigator is the responsible leader of the team. "Subinvestigator" includes 
  any other individual member of that team. </p>
<p>"Marketing application" means an application for a new drug submitted under 
  section 505(b) of the act, a request to provide for certification of an antibiotic 
  submitted under section 507 of the act, or a product license application for 
  a biological product submitted under the Public Health Service Act. </p>
<p>"Sponsor" means a person who takes responsibility for and initiates a clinical 
  investigation. The sponsor may be an individual or pharmaceutical company, governmental 
  agency, academic institution, private organization, or other organization. The 
  sponsor does not actually conduct the investigation unless the sponsor is a 
  sponsor-investigator. A person other than an individual that uses one or more 
  of its own employees to conduct an investigation that it has initiated is a 
  sponsor, not a sponsor-investigator, and the employees are investigators. </p>
<p>"Sponsor-Investigator" means an individual who both initiates and conducts 
  an investigation, and under whose immediate direction the investigational drug 
  is administered or dispensed. The term does not include any person other than 
  an individual. The requirements applicable to a sponsor-investigator under this 
  part include both those applicable to an investigator and a sponsor. </p>
<p>"Subject" means a human who participates in an investigation, either as a recipient 
  of the investigational new drug or as a control. A subject may be a healthy 
  human or a patient with a disease. </p>
<h3>ß 312.6 Labeling of an investigational new drug. </h3>
<p>(a) The immediate package of an investigational new drug intended for human 
  use shall bear a label with the statement "Caution: New Drug -- Limited by Federal 
  (or United States) law to investigational use." </p>
<p>(b) The label or labeling of an investigational new drug shall not bear any 
  statement that is false or misleading in any particular and shall not represent 
  that the investigational new drug is safe or effective for the purposes for 
  which it is being investigated. </p>
<h3>ß 312.7 Promotion and sale of investigational drugs. </h3>
<p>(a) Promotion of an investigational new drug. A sponsor or investigator, or 
  any person acting on behalf of a sponsor or investigator, shall not represent 
  in a promotional context that an investigational new drug is safe or effective 
  for the purposes for which it is under investigation or otherwise promote the 
  drug. This provision is not intended to restrict the full exchange of scientific 
  information concerning the drug, including dissemination of scientific findings 
  in scientific or lay media. Rather, its intent is to restrict promotional claims 
  of safety or effectiveness of the drug for a use for which it is under investigation 
  and to preclude commercialization of the drug before it is approved for commercial 
  distribution. </p>
<p>(b) Commercial distribution of an investigational new drug. A sponsor or investigator 
  shall not commercially distribute or test market an investigational new drug. 
</p>
<p>(c) Prolonging an investigation. A sponsor shall not unduly prolong an investigation 
  after finding that the results of the investigation appear to establish sufficient 
  data to support a marketing application. </p>
<p>(d) Sale of an investigational drug. If the drug is to be sold, the sponsor 
  should submit a notification to FDA providing a full explanation why sale is 
  required and why the sale should not be regarded as the commercialization of 
  a new drug for which an application is not approved. </p>
<h3>ß 312.10 Waivers. </h3>
<p>(a) A sponsor may request FDA to waive applicable requirement under this part. 
  A waiver request may be submitted either in an IND or in an information amendment 
  to an IND. In an emergency, a request may be made by telephone or other rapid 
  communication means. A waiver request is required to contain at least one of 
  the following: </p>
<p>(1) An explanation why the sponsor's compliance with the requirement is unnecessary 
  or cannot be achieved; </p>
<p>(2) A description of an alternative submission or course of action that satisfies 
  the purpose of the requirement; or </p>
<p>(3) Other information justifying a waiver. </p>
<p>(b) FDA may grant a waiver if it finds that the sponsor's noncompliance would 
  not pose a significant and unreasonable risk to human subjects of the investigation 
  and that one of the following is met: </p>
<p>(1) The sponsor's compliance with the requirement is unnecessary for the agency 
  to evaluate the application, or compliance cannot be achieved; </p>
<p>(2) The sponsor's proposed alternative satisfies the requirement; or </p>
<p>(3) The applicant's submission otherwise justifies a waiver. </p>

<h3>ß 312.20 Requirement for an IND. </h3>
<p>(a) A sponsor shall submit an IND to FDA if the sponsor intends to conduct 
  a clinical investigation with an investigational new drug that is subject to 
  ß 312.2(a). </p>
<p>(b) A sponsor shall not begin a clinical investigation subject to ß 312.2(a) 
  until the investigation is subject to an IND which is in effect in accordance 
  with ß 312.40. </p>
<h3>ß 312.21 Phases of an investigation. </h3>
<p>An IND may be submitted for one or more phases of an investigation. The clinical 
  investigation of a previously untested drug is generally divided into three 
  phases. Although in general the phases are conducted sequentially, they may 
  overlap. These three phases of an investigation are a follows: </p>
<p>(a) Phase 1. (1) Phase 1 includes the initial introduction of an investigational 
  new drug into humans. Phase 1 studies are typically closely monitored and may 
  be conducted in patients or normal volunteer subjects. These studies are designed 
  to determine the metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the drug in humans, 
  the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain 
  early evidence on effectiveness. During Phase 1, sufficient information about 
  the drug's pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects should be obtained to 
  permit the design of well-controlled, scientifically valid, Phase 2 studies. 
  The total number of subjects and patients included in Phase 1 studies varies 
  with the drug, but is generally in the range of 20 to 80. </p>
<p>(2) Phase 1 studies also include studies of drug metabolism, structure-activity 
  relationships, and mechanism of action in humans, as well as studies in which 
  investigational drugs are used as research tools to explore biological phenomena 
  or disease processes. </p>
<p>(b) Phase 2. Phase 2 includes the controlled clinical studies conducted to 
  evaluate the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication or indications 
  in patients with the disease or condition under study and to determine the common 
  short-term side effects and risks associated with the drug. Phase 2 studies 
  are typically well controlled, closely monitored, and conducted in a relatively 
  small number of patients, usually involving no more than several hundred subjects. 
</p>
<p>(c) Phase 3. Phase 3 studies are expanded controlled and uncontrolled trials. 
  They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the 
  drug has been obtained, and are intended to gather the additional information 
  about effectiveness and safety that is needed to evaluate the overall benefit-risk 
  relationship of the drug and to provide an adequate basis for physician labeling. 
  Phase 3 studies usually include from several hundred to several thousand subjects. 
</p>
<h3>ß 312.22 General principles of the IND submission. </h3>
<p>(a) FDA's primary objectives in reviewing an IND are, in all phases of the 
  investigation, to assure the safety and rights of subjects, and, in Phase 2 
  and 3, to help assure that the quality of the scientific evaluation of drugs 
  is adequate to permit an evaluation of the drug's effectiveness and safety. 
  Therefore, although FDA's review of Phase 1 submissions will focus on assessing 
  the safety of Phase 1 investigations, FDA's review of Phases 2 and 3 submissions 
  will also include an assessment of the scientific quality of the clinical investigations 
  and the likelihood that the investigations will yield data capable of meeting 
  statutory standards for marketing approval. </p>
<p>(b) The amount of information on a particular drug that must be submitted in 
  an IND to assure the accomplishment of the objectives described in paragraph 
  (a) of this section depends upon such factors as the novelty of the drug, the 
  extent to which it has been studied previously, the known or suspected risks, 
  and the developmental phase of the drug. </p>
<p>(c) The central focus of the initial IND submission should be on the general 
  investigational plan and the protocols for specific human studies. Subsequent 
  amendments to the IND that contain new or revised protocols should build logically 
  on previous submissions and should be supported by additional information, including 
  the results of animal toxicology studies or other human studies as appropriate. 
  Annual reports to the IND should serve as the focus for reporting the status 
  of studies being conducted under the IND and should update the general investigational 
  plan for the coming year. </p>
<p>(d) The IND format set forth in ß 312.23 should be followed routinely by sponsors 
  in the interest of fostering an efficient review of applications. Sponsors are 
  expected to exercise considerable discretion, however, regarding the content 
  of information submitted in each section, depending upon the kind of drug being 
  studied and the nature of the available information. Section 312.23 outlines 
  the information needed for a commercially sponsored IND for a new molecular 
  entity. A sponsor-investigator who uses, as a research tool, an investigational 
  new drug that is already subject to a manufacturer's IND or marketing application 
  should follow the same general format, but ordinarily may, if authorized by 
  the manufacturer, refer to the manufacturer's IND or marketing application in 
  providing the technical information supporting the proposed clinical investigation. 
  A sponsor-investigator who uses an investigational drug not subject to a manufacturer's 
  IND or marketing application is ordinarily required to submit all technical 
  information supporting the IND, unless such information may be referenced from 
  the scientific literature. </p>
