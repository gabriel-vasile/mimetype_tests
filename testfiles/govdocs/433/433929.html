        Strategies</b></font></p>
      <p align="left">Evaluations of these prevention strategies have brought 
        to light a variety of problems, including recognizing developmental issues 
        for children and adolescents, defining and measuring outcomes, and relating 
        selection criteria and targeted outcomes to risk factor research, and 
        other practical issues, all of which are discussed below. Careful consideration 
        of these problems will help researchers and programmers design programs 
        that better identify and address targeted risk factors and outcomes. </p>
      <p align="left"><b><font color="#006666" size="4">Recognizing Developmental 
        Issues</font></b></p>
      <p align="left"><b>Infants and toddlers.</b> Programs for infants and toddlers 
        focus on parent-child interactions through education and provision of 
        emotional and practical support to the primary caregiver. They often target 
        poor families and are delivered in the hospital or the family's home. 
        However, these intervention programs have not been standardized and thus 
        may not be highly reliable or easily disseminated. They do not include 
        behavioral management techniques for parents that can reduce antisocial 
        behavior among children and adolescents. Finally, long-term followup on 
        child behavior has been limited, focusing instead on care of the child 
        and child adjustment, especially in terms of health.</p>
      <p align="left"><b>Preschool children.</b> Most programs for preschool children 
        have not included parent management training. Preschool interventions 
        have not targeted peer relations, which are indicators of outcome. Although 
        some of these programs have included long-term followup and have shown 
        positive effects on antisocial behavior, researchers have not been able 
        to attribute these positive outcomes to a specific cause. The complex 
        social and economic changes of the past 20 years make analysis difficult 
        (Yoshikawa, 1995). Current studies should therefore include the standardized 
        interventions described in manuals and regular evaluations so that successful 
        programs can be replicated.</p>
      <p align="left"><b>Elementary school children.</b> Programs for elementary 
        school children are usually school based. Unfortunately, families are 
        not often involved in these programs, and children thus tend to drop out. 
        Even if a program offers parent groups, not all parents will take advantage 
        of them. These programs also rarely assess or address ADHD. An additional 
        problem in the design of school-based programs is the effect of "spillover," 
        which occurs when both control and intervention classrooms are located 
        within the same school. Control classrooms may adopt elements of the intervention 
        (spillover), thus affecting the results of the study.</p>
      <p align="left"><b>Adolescents.</b> Programs for adolescents often focus 
        on educational approaches but lack family components, especially in universal 
        programs where it is difficult to involve parents of nonreferred adolescents. 
        If the family is not involved, the youth may have difficulty internalizing 
        and generalizing intervention lessons across settings. This may be one 
        reason why conflict resolution programs show such uneven results and sometimes 
        paradoxical effects. Evaluators of conflict resolution programs should 
        supplement their usual psychoeducational approach with information from 
        independent records, such as arrest data (Bry, 1982; Bry and George, 1980) 
        or vandalism records,<a name="twentytwo"></a><font size="-1"><sup><a href="#22">22</a></sup></font> or raters 		who are blind to the intervention; otherwise, 
        the success of the curriculums will not be measurable (Webster, 1993).</p>
      <p align="left"><b><font color="#006666" size="4">Defining and Measuring 
        Outcomes</font></b></p>
      <p align="left"><b>Defined targets.</b> Programs should have clearly defined 
        targets. These should be outcomes that are developmentally linked to antisocial 
        behavior or to specific risk or protective factors. Targeting hypothesized 
        risk factors such as moral reasoning may not result in a corresponding 
        change in child behavior.</p>
      <p align="left"><b>Effectiveness.</b> When some risk factors, such as family 
        process or early disruptive behavior, are targeted, effect sizes are small, 
        even when the targeted processes are influenced and the changes are statistically 
        significant. The effectiveness of the intervention may be called into 
        question because the targeted process is influenced by a variety of factors 
        that are highly interwoven and cannot be changed by a single-focus intervention. 
        One exception is medication studies of children with ADHD, which show 
        large effect sizes for inattention and disruptiveness or substantial gains 
        1 year after the treatment (Kazdin et al., 1987a; Kazdin, Siegel, and 
        Bass, 1992).</p>
      <p align="left"><b>Specificity.</b> Specificity is another issue. Although 
        antisocial children are likely to have certain deficits, not all of them 
        will show the same pattern of problems. It is important to choose an intervention 
        that directly addresses an identified deficit in a subgroup of children. 
        Otherwise, the intervention or treatment evaluation may give the false 
        impression that the program was only moderately effective, when in fact 
        it was very effective with a subgroup of children. More research needs 
        to be done to determine which interventions are most effective for specific 
        risk factors.</p>
      <p align="left"><b>Neglected outcomes.</b> Studies also should address neglected 
        outcomes. Most interventions focus on overt aggressive behavior, with 
        insufficient attention paid to covert antisocial acts. Although physical 
        aggression is easily observable, most later delinquency is covert in nature.</p>
      <p align="left"><b>Long-term followup.</b> Most studies have not included 
        long-term followup, even at 1 year. Without it, long-term maintenance 
        of treatment gains cannot be demonstrated.</p>
      <p align="left"><b>Gender.</b> Because the development of antisocial behavior 
        may be different for boys and girls, gender must be considered in program 
        design (Wasserman, 1996). Most interventions are designed with boys in 
        mind and have been applied only to boys. When applied to girls, they may 
        be less effective (Farrell and Meyer, 1997; Kellam et al., 1998). As a 
        result, designers of prevention programs should consider new research 
        on female antisocial behavior (Crick, Bigbee, and Howes, 1996; Crick and 
        Grotpeter, 1995; Zoccolillo, 1993).</p>
      <p align="left"><b><font color="#006666" size="4">Relating Selection Criteria 
        and Targeted Outcomes to Risk Factor Research</font></b></p>
      <p align="left">Categories of risk factors for delinquency and violence 
        have been conceptualized in a variety of ways. Hawkins and Catalano (1993), 
        for example, define categories of risk at the levels of community, family, 
        school, and so on. However, these categories do not readily correspond 
        to the selection criteria or outcomes studied in prevention research. 
        That is, risk factors for serious, violent juvenile offending are not 
        necessarily the outcomes targeted by preventive interventions. The problem 
        lies in distinguishing between those factors used to select children at 
        high risk and those factors that are themselves targets of intervention. 
        For example, community risk factors such as poverty are commonly used 
        as selection criteria for studies, but they are often inaccurate indicators 
        of individual risk and are seldom targeted for intervention. The opposite 
        tends to be true with family risk factors. Families are assumed to have 
        family management problems if they are selected on the basis of other 
        risk factors, such as the child's aggressive behavior or poverty.</p>
      <p align="left">School and individual risk factors that are used as selection 
        criteria are often the focus of intervention. However, targeted outcomes 
        based on these criteria may not be linked to offending. For example, social 
        competency, peer relations, self-control, ethnic identity, or student-faculty 
        communication have not been proven to contribute to antisocial behavior, 
        nor have they been proven to be protective factors that will lessen the 
        risk for antisocial behavior. Protective factors are not simply the opposite 
        of risk factors.</p>
      <p align="left">Some risk factors have not been widely examined in prevention 
        research. Family history of problem behavior is an excellent selection 
        criterion,<a name="twentythree"></a><font size="-1"><sup><a href="#23">23</a></sup></font> and younger 			siblings of delinquents are an obvious, but underaddressed, 
        target group. As discussed above, ADHD is an important selection criterion 
        and intervention target, but programs targeting delinquency have yet to 
        address the disorder systematically.</p>
      <p align="left"><b><font color="#006666" size="4">Practical Issues</font></b></p>
      <p align="left"><b>Limitations of single-focus preventions.</b> Antisocial 
        behavior is rarely the result of a single risk factor.<a name="twentyfour"></a><font size="-1"><sup><a 			href="#24">24</a></sup></font> 
        Youth live in layered and complex environments that contain multiple risk 
        factors at different levels. As a result, successful approaches to prevention 
        must incorporate components directed at more than one type of risk factor.<a name="twentyfive"></a><font size="-1"><sup><a 		href="#25">25</a></sup></font> 
        Designers of prevention programs must consider:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Available institutional resources. For example, is the school able 
          to run the program?<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>The family environment. For example, will the family become involved? 
          Does the family have other problems that need to be addressed?<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>The child's chronological age and developmental level. For example, 
          what interventions are appropriate given the child's developmental level? 
          Is the child facing a school transition, such as entry into a new school?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Antisocial behaviors and the impact of risk factors vary with a child's 
        age and development. Transitions between school levels are important intervention 
        points (Coie and Jacobs, 1993), partly because they reconstitute the child's 
        peer group. At such transitions, other risk factors, such as neighborhood 
        influences on the school, come into play.</p>
      <p><b>Recruiting and retaining participants.</b> Two practical problems 
        hamper the design and implementation of research studies and programs 
        that target serious and violent juvenile offending. The first problem 
        is the feasibility of recruiting and retaining participants. Although 
        school-based programs are popular because children provide a "captive 
        audience," it is difficult to involve families in these programs. Outpatient 
        child psychiatry clinics also have a high rate of missed appointments 
        among families with antisocial children. Retaining control-group families 
        is even more difficult.</p>
      <p>In a pilot randomized clinical trial in New York City, Miller and Klein 
        (1996) used a variety of methods to maintain parent participation. The 
        program paid families for assessments and for the costs incurred in attending 
        the clinic, provided food, performed initial assessments in families' 
        homes, and sent holiday cards to families. Each family provided the telephone 
        numbers and addresses of two family members or friends so that families 
        involved in the program could be contacted, and family members in both 
        the control and intervention groups received referrals for services. When 
        appropriate, bilingual interveners conducted home visits in Spanish. The 
        study had a low attrition rate of 10 percent and, using a consumer satisfaction 
        questionnaire (Webster-Stratton, 1989), researchers found that satisfaction 
        among parents was high.</p>
      <p><b>Identifying necessary components.</b> The second practical problem 
        is identifying necessary components. As noted earlier, multifaceted interventions 
        that target the development of chronic aggression are the most effective. 
        Because home and peer settings establish and maintain antisocial behavior, 
        interventions that include parent management training and a peer component 
        are more successful. Programs also should enhance academic skills and 
        provide for the treatment of conditions such as ADHD. If interventions 
        take place early in the child's development and later during developmental 
        transitions, such as those between school levels, the child will be better 
        able to generalize one set of skills across all settings.</p>
