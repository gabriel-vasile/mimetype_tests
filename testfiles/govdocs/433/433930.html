<P><b>The Cumulative Effects of Protection</b></P>

<P>Just as multiple risks and adversities increase one’s risk, so multiple 
protective mechanisms improve one’s chances for a positive outcome. <B> 
</B>Radke-Yarrow and Brown (1993) found that their resilient children general 
enjoyed multiple supportive factors (M = 4.5, range = 0-7) which outnumbered 
risk factors (M = 1.1, range = 0-6).  &quot;The typical situation for the 
resilient child,&quot; they say, &quot;was one in which positive factors 
reinforced each other, enhancing the possibilities of sustaining the child’s 
successful functioning. .... Support factors within and outside the child ... 
act <I>synergistically</I> to maintain adaptive functioning....  If one area 
were to cause difficulty, other areas are there to repair or replace&quot; (p.588).           </P>

<P>Masten and her colleagues (1988) stress  &quot;the importance of assessing 
multiple dimensions of adaptation and multiple attributes in the search for 
understanding resilience.&quot; <B> </B>She notes that the <I>combination</I> of  
higher IQ, higher SES, and better parenting quality have been found to be 
positively associated with competence and negatively associated with stress 
exposure (Masten, et al., 1988,  p.759).  Similarly, Garmezy reports that he and 
Nuechterlein (19 ) found multiple protective factors associated with competent 
black children: Their teachers rated them as friendly, well liked by peers, and 
not lethargic, tense, sullen, or restless.   Their self-perceptions were founded 
on a sense of power, self regard, and positive assessments of their social 
attributes.   In terms of their cognitive skills, they scored high on 
intelligent tests, were  cautious., not impulsive, and solved problems in a 
reflective manner.   They were active, goal-directed, eager to learn, did more 
than was required of them, participating in classroom discussion, preferred 
active educational pursuits, and aspired to high vocational goals (Garmezy, 1991).</P>

<P>In his study of 200 families from inner-city Minneapolis, Garmezy (1987) 
devoted a great deal of time &quot;to exploring relations among a number of 
major environmental and individual variables, using multiple indicators of 
stress exposure, competence and the like, to insure the stability of our 
constructs&quot; (p. 170).  Among his findings were:</P>

<ol>
<li>Children with greater assets (higher IQ, higher SES, and positive family 
attributes of stability and cohesion) appeared to be more competent and, under 
stress, more socially engaged with their peers and in their classroom.<p>

<li>Higher SES, IQ, and, for girls, more positive family attributes (e.g., 
quality of the parent-child relationship, adequacy of family communication, 
degree of parents’ perceptiveness about the child, and overall competence of the 
parent) appeared to be protective factors against disruptive-aggressive response 
to stress.<p>

<li>The quality of a child’s social engagement in school was related not only to 
IQ and SES but also to social comprehension – a factor that reflects interpersonal 
understanding, problem-solving ability, and humor comprehension, appreciation, 
and production.  Social comprehension was, in turn, positively related to the 
engagement in school and negatively related to disruptiveness.<P>

<li>Potential family-related modifiers of competence and stress were family 
stability, organization, and cohesion.  Children with these more advantageous 
family characteristics were more intelligent, more competent, and less likely to 
become disruptive under high levels of stress.</P>

<P>(Garmezy, 1987, p. 170)</P>
</ol>

<B><P>Correlations or Causes?</P></B>

<P>With regard to the protective factors listed above and others we will discuss, 
Masten and Coatsworth (1998) stress the fact that <B><I>all of these 
characteristics are only known to correlate with resilience; they are not 
necessarily causes.  </B></I>In fact, they <B><I>could just as well be 
consequences </B></I>of success rather than causes of it.  Moreover, we must 
remember Rutter’s advice and attempt to understand the <I>processes</I> by which 
these variables interact with each other to provide protection against risk 
processes.  To organize the vast body of research on protective 
factors/mechanisms/processes, we will look first at characteristics of 
individuals deemed to be resilient, then we will look at the processes in 
families, school, and communities which appear to foster the development and 
maintenance of resilience.</P><P>
