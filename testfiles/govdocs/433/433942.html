assumes that we do require that the associational activity in\
question involve a matter of public concern, but does not\
adequately address why Morris\'s union association did not, in fact,\
implicate such a matter.  Thus, the public concern issue as to\
Morris is waived.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Zannino</span>, 895 F.2d at 17.</p>\

Five Bristol County Massachusetts
correctional officers were suspended from their jobs by Sheriff
Thomas Hodgson.  Claiming that the sheriff's actions were in
retaliation for their First Amendment activities, they sued
pursuant to 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983, in addition to bringing various
claims under state law.  A jury found Hodgson liable in his
official capacity on the &sect; 1983 claims, found against him on some
of the state law claims, and awarded a total of $17,980 in
compensatory damages.  In this appeal, we reject each of Hodgson's
claims of error and affirm the judgment.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>In 2000, the Sheriff's Department employed 350
correctional officers, all of whom were members of the
Massachusetts Correctional Officers Federated Union (the "union"). 
Among the correctional facilities operated by the Department were
the Ash Street jail in New Bedford and the House of Correction in
North Dartmouth.  Four of the plaintiffs worked at the Ash Street
facility; plaintiff David Davignon worked at the House of
Correction.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>All five of the plaintiffs were active in union affairs. 
Plaintiffs Davignon, David Gouveia, David Miller and Thomas Presby
were union stewards, and counted among their union duties looking
into management's alleged violations of the collective bargaining
agreement.  Davignon and Presby were also members of the union&#8217;s
negotiating subcommittee, as was plaintiff Edward Morris, Jr.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>In the spring of 2000, with their collective bargaining
agreement set to expire in June, the union and the Department began
negotiating a new agreement.  Hodgson, who as sheriff was in charge
of the correctional facilities, was among those representing the
Department at these negotiations.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>The jury heard testimony that, by the summer of 2000,
negotiations had grown tense, after no progress on a new agreement
had been made after several sessions.  Davignon testified that
union negotiators had trouble getting release time from work to
attend the sessions.  At one session in late June, tensions boiled
over.  According to testimony, Hodgson had arrived more than thirty
minutes late, and at the close of the session a union
representative asked him to be punctual for the next meeting. 
Witnesses said that Hodgson cursed at the representative, slammed
his hand on the table and said, "I'm the Sheriff.  If you have to
wait, you'll wait for me."  Both Davignon and Presby were present,
in their capacities as union negotiators.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>In time, the union requested mediation.  In September,
after returning from the first mediation session, Presby requested
and received permission from superior officers to address fellow
officers at roll call.  There was testimony that presentation of
information unrelated to the facility's daily operations was not
unusual at roll calls, including giving updates on union activity. 
Presby reported that the negotiation sessions had not been going
well and that the union planned to hold a meeting to determine its
next step.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Presby's update became the subject of an internal
investigation ordered by Hodgson, to determine whether Presby had
left his post in order to give the report.  A few days after
Presby's remarks, Hodgson also ordered an additional investigation
into whether Presby and Morris had left open a door to the central
control area of the Ash Street jail.  Hodgson testified that he
initiated this latter investigation because an administrator told
him that on a visit to the facility eleven days prior, the
administrator had walked through a number of unlocked doors
including a door to central control.  The administrator identified
Morris and Presby among the officers present in the central control
area.  He did not, however, submit a written report on the date of
the incident as called for by standard departmental procedure. 
While these investigations were underway, Hodgson issued a policy
directive stressing that union representatives could not use roll
call to discuss union business. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>The union decided to hold a picket at a busy intersection
near the Ash Street facility to express dissatisfaction with the
contract negotiations and to criticize Hodgson's treatment of
correctional officers and their families.  The union mailed a
letter to its members providing relevant information, and Davignon,
Gouveia and Miller spoke with individual correctional officers at
work about the planned picket.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>At trial, conversations between plaintiffs and four
officers were highlighted.  There was no dispute that the
conversations were brief, with estimates ranging from approximately
ten to forty-five seconds.  Testimony conflicted as to the precise
nature of Gouveia's and Davignon's conversations.  Gouveia said
that he relayed information about the picket to two officers, but
there was also testimony that he asked them if they were going to
attend the picket.  One noted that Gouveia held a pen and paper
during the encounter.  Further, although Gouveia testified that
several officers approached him and asked him about the picket, the
only officers that reported Gouveia spoke to them said that he did
the approaching.  One officer asserted that Davignon contacted him
by telephone and asked him if he would be attending the picket. 
Davignon denied doing so both in investigative interviews and at
trial.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Neither the plaintiffs nor the officers with whom they
spoke testified that the conversations distracted any of them from
their work, or otherwise endangered staff or inmates.  The officer
allegedly contacted by phone did, however, testify that "in a
sense" he was taken away from his post to answer Davignon's phone
call.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Hodgson ordered an investigation into these encounters,
to determine whether officers had been pressured or coerced to

investigation because one of the officers had mentioned to him that
he felt that he was being harassed about the picket.</span></p>

<span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"> and several witnesses testified that
Hodgson told officers that, based on <span style="text-decoration: underline">Garrity</span>, he could terminate
those who failed to be completely truthful during internal affairs
investigations.  He also stated that employees could not conduct
union business on duty, and further that he knew there were
"troublemakers" in the department whom he would not hesitate to
remove.  Relatedly, he stressed that if they were terminated they
might grieve and eventually get their jobs back, but they would be
making five or six dollars an hour in the interim.  Both Gouveia
and Davignon testified that Hodgson stared directly at them when
making the "troublemakers" comment. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Hodgson also discussed the status of the collective
bargaining negotiations.  He told the officers that the election
was over, he was the sheriff, and that the longer it took to settle
the contract the less money there would be for them and their
families.  He also informed them that there would be no retroactive
pay, and that someone was misleading them if they were being told
otherwise.  Explaining at trial why he could discuss union matters
at roll call even though his earlier directive had explicitly
banned such discussion, Hodgson asserted that different rules
applied to him as sheriff.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>The three investigations had the following results. 
First, with respect to whether Presby impermissibly left his post
to address a roll call, investigators determined that Presby did
have permission to leave his post.  Second, as to the open central
control door, Morris and Presby were assigned to the area, neither
recalled interacting with the administrator, and Presby
specifically stated that he always complied with rules regarding
entrance doors.  The administrator reaffirmed, and filed a written
report confirming, that the central control door was indeed open
and that he had observed Morris and other personnel in the area. 
Finally, with respect to the investigation of the picket-related
speech by Davignon, Gouveia, and Miller, interviews of more than
sixty officers yielded written statements from four officers
stating that the plaintiffs had spoken to them about the picket. 
In his statement one of the officers noted that he told one of the
plaintiffs to get back to him when he had more<i> </i>information about<i>
</i>the picket.  None of the officers wrote that the plaintiffs
harassed, pressured, solicited or coerced them during their brief
conversations.  Three of them gave oral statements and trial
testimony consistent with their written statements.  The one
officer whom Davignon had allegedly telephoned, however, testified
at trial that he felt harassed by the phone call.</span></p>

by one of the officers that he had been harassed, Hodgson suspended
Davignon, Gouveia, and Miller for thirty days without pay,
transferred them to another facility, stripped them of their
seniority rights and changed their days off from weekends to
weekdays.  Presby and Morris were suspended for ten days without
pay based on the open door incident. </span></p>

Miller charged them with soliciting correctional officers to
participate in a union picket.  The letters cited Article VII of
the Collective Bargaining Agreement as the basis for the
suspensions but also pointed out that the plaintiffs' wrongful
conduct "interfered with other correctional officers' performance
of their duties" and adversely affected "the efficient operation of
the department and potentially the health and safety of all

suspensions.  With respect to Davignon, Gouveia and Miller, he
generally reiterated the grounds cited in the suspension letters
but added that he also relied on the oral statement by one of the
officers about feeling harassed.  Hodgson acknowledged that he
believed the plaintiffs had pressured rather than harassed other
officers.  He also testified at length about the general risks
present in the correctional facility setting and the dangers that
speech like the plaintiffs' posed to the facility's security
because of the great potential for distraction.</span></p>

suspensions were based on the investigative report of the door
incident.  By contrast, Presby testified that in the past staff had
pointed out opened doors but that no one had been punished as a
result.  Further, both Hodgson and the supervisor acknowledged that
they did not investigate the administrator's report of another door
left open.</span></p>

specific rule disallowing union speech during working hours aside
from the sheriff&#8217;s directive banning union speech at roll calls. 
Further, although Hodgson at one point testified that it was a
violation to be doing anything other than working in the facility,
he later said that officers were permitted to talk about non-union
related topics such as upcoming parades, sports, and other small
talk subjects.  Several witnesses testified that officers often
discuss non-work related matters at work.  Finally, there was
testimony that departmental telephones at times were used to make
personal calls.</span></p>

official capacities, seeking damages and injunctive relief under 42

speech and association.  All five plaintiffs also alleged violation
of the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act ("MCRA"), Mass. Gen. Laws c.
12, &sect;&sect; 11H, 11I, and asserted additional state law claims,
including invasion of privacy under Mass. Gen. Laws c. 214 &sect; 1B,

party, the case was tried before a jury.  The verdicts were mixed.
On the &sect; 1983 claims the jury found in favor of Hodgson in his
individual capacity but against him in his official capacity, and
awarded the plaintiffs lost wages.  The jury also found for Morris
under the MCRA but awarded no damages.  It found in favor of 
Davignon, Gouveia and Miller for intentional interference with
advantageous relations, with no damages awarded to Davignon; and
for Hodgson on the invasion of privacy claims.</span></p>

first, the district court erred in concluding as a matter of law
that the First Amendment protected the plaintiffs&#8217; speech; second,
no reasonable jury could have found that Presby&#8217;s and Morris&#8217;s
punishments were in retaliation for their exercise of First
Amendment rights; third, the jury&#8217;s &sect; 1983 individual capacity
findings in favor of Hodgson were inconsistent with the findings in
favor of Morris on his MCRA claim and in favor of Davignon, Gouveia
and Miller on their intentional interference claims; and fourth,
the district court erred in instructing the jury regarding the
First Amendment claims.  Two evidentiary challenges and an attack
on the attorney fee award are also mounted.  We consider these
claims in turn.</span></p>

In the past we have cautioned against allowing the inherent public

"necessarily entail a substantial criticism of management raise
matters of public concern.")  Here, not only did the plaintiffs'
speech involve union activity in general, but one of the picket's
stated purposes was to allow union members to publicly express
criticism of management.  At trial, Davignon, Gouveia, and Miller
all testified to this fact, specifically asserting that the picket
would publicize Hodgson's alleged unfair treatment of correctional

wanting.  First, the statements were not muttered complaints about
Hodgson or his administration but rather were responses to
questions about -- or requests for support of -- an upcoming
picket.  Even if we were to construe the content of the statements
as being indirectly critical either of Hodgson's behavior toward
the correctional workers or of the administration's stance in the
collective bargaining process, such would not automatically strip
the speech of its public qualities.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">See</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">Givhan</span> v. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Western Line
Consol. Sch. Dist.</span>, 439 U.S. 410, 415-416 (1979) (noting fact that
employee's workplace speech criticized her government employer did
not necessarily indicate that it did not involve matter of public
concern).  Second, although it would be naive to think that the
plaintiffs in this case were moved to speak solely by the spirit of
civic-mindedness, our cases do not mandate selflessness on the part
of plaintiffs.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">See</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">Fabiano</span>, 352 F.3d at 455 (holding employee's

ways from persuading co-workers to attend the picket. 
Nevertheless, the record also supports a conclusion that the
plaintiffs wanted to improve the collective bargaining process as
a whole and attempted to do so through the time tested method of
drawing the public's attention to what they considered unfair
behavior on the part of the defendant.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Compare</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">Saulpaug</span>h v. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Monroe

may not have acted with bad faith, he acted unreasonably in
arriving at his suspension decision.  As the suspension letters
indicate, Hodgson took action because he believed the plaintiffs'
speech, as reported, involved solicitation of other officers,
caused interference with the other officers' performance of duties,
and created safety risks.  In arriving at this conclusion, however,
the defendant consulted four written reports that did not 
characterize the plaintiffs' statements as solicitation, contained
virtually no mention of distraction or interference with work

and amici raise concerns that are not insubstantial.  In addition
to contending that the plaintiffs' speech caused actual disruption,
Hodgson testified about the more general need to assert control
over correctional officers' speech.  He spent considerable time
detailing the pressurized, high-stakes environment in which the
officers work and relating how, in particular, if plaintiffs'
speech was left unchecked, it could have potentially disrupted that
environment, creating risks to the safety of employees and inmates
alike.  </span></p>

not in our view demonstrated how the plaintiffs' speech here
created harm or increased risks.  There was no evidence of actual
disruption, despite the fact that the plaintiffs spoke at work and
during work hours.  The plaintiffs' statements to fellow employees
were brief, generally lasting a matter of seconds.  The brevity of
these statements likely posed no greater danger than the small talk
regularly engaged in during working hours.  At trial, the sole
evidence presented about distraction was one officer's testimony 
that he was taken from his post "in a sense" by Davignon's phone
call.  Taking nothing away from whatever subjective view that
officer holds of his post, Davignon, both in interviews and at
trial, denied ever consulting that officer about the picket. 
Against the competing evidence, this lone characterization of a
conversation by one officer is rather thin.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Against the scant evidence of actual disruption, Hodgson
reasonably asserts that a government employer is entitled to
consider not only whether the employee's speech actually disrupted
the work place environment but also whether the speech had the
potential to disrupt.  He argues that the plaintiffs' speech
threatened to "disintegrate" working relationships by creating a
division between officers sympathetic to the union and those who
were not.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Indeed, an employer may consider a speech's potential to
disrupt.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">See</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">Connick</span>, 461 U.S. at 152 ("We do not see the
necessity for an employer to allow events to unfold to the extent
that the disruption of the office and the destruction of working
relationships is manifest before taking action").  Nevertheless,
there is a significant question on these facts&#160;whether Hodgson
suspended the plaintiffs because of their speech's <span style="text-decoration: underline">potential</span> to
disrupt when the suspension letters issued to the plaintiffs refer
solely to the <span style="text-decoration: underline">actual</span> disruption the speech caused.  </span></p>

Hodgson's position that the plaintiffs' speech threatened to
disrupt the harmony among workers.  Testimony and the investigative
reports reveal that when the plaintiffs approached other officers
they did so in a civil, non-threatening manner.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">See</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">Lewis</span> v.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Harrison Sch. Dist.</span>, 805 F.2d 310, 315-316 (8th Cir.

disruptive where speech was civil in tone).  In fact, the evidence
was that in some instances, other officers actually sought
information from the plaintiffs about the picket.</span></p>

hostility toward officers unsympathetic to the union, Hodgson's
concerns about potential disruption to workplace harmony would have
substance.  After an exhaustive review of the record, however, we
find not even the specter of such harm.  The "mere incantation of
the phrase 'internal harmony in the workplace' is not enough to
carry the day."  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Gustafson</span>, 290 F.3d at 911 (citing <span style="text-decoration: underline">Hubert</span> v.

here, the safety and efficiency of correctional facilities
everywhere would be compromised.  But we do not view this case as
being about whether a correctional facility employer can prohibit
all non-work related conversation on the job.  Rather, we engage in
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Pickering</span> balancing of the interests presented, necessarily taking
into account a number of highly case specific factors.  Included
among these are the employer's motives in taking the adverse
action.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>In this case, there is ample evidence that Hodgson
suspended the plaintiffs not out of a legitimate concern that their
speech compromised safety at the correctional facilities but
because of their pro-union activity.  First, the timing of the
suspensions is suspect.  When Hodgson suspended the five active
union members, he had already demonstrated significant frustration
with the union, indulging in a outburst during one negotiation
session in particular.  Both Davignon and Presby, part of the
union's negotiating team, were present at this session.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">See</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">Mihos</span>,
358 F.3d at 103 (noting government side of scale undermined if
evidence indicates employer fired employee in a "retaliatory fit of
pique").</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Additionally, Hodgson's own actions and pattern of
enforcement further undermine his claim of legitimate motives. 
Although asserting that discussion of union matters is particularly
divisive and poses a serious risk of disruption, Hodgson used roll
call to personally discuss these same union matters.  Relatedly, if
Hodgson was so concerned that any non-work focused speech would
create such serious distractions and risks, we think it is more
than curious that he would allow employees to discuss things such
as parades and sports without punishment.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Finally, Hodgson argues that the fact that the plaintiffs
were not authorized to "conduct" union business on county time
further bolsters the government's interest.  On the facts of this
case, this argument is unpersuasive for two reasons.  First, while
the issue of whether the plaintiffs violated office policy is not
irrelevant to the <span style="text-decoration: underline">Pickering</span> inquiry, <span style="text-decoration: underline">see</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">Connick</span>, 461 U.S. at 153,
it is unclear what policy Hodgson relies on.  Nowhere in the
collective bargaining agreement, the list of the duties and
responsibilities of correctional officers, or the code of
ethics/employee conduct and work rules is the topic of "conducting"
union business specifically addressed.  Moreover, it is highly
doubtful that the brief asides about an upcoming picket that took
place here constitute "conducting" union business, any more than,
for example, posting a notice would. </span></p>

Davignon, Gouveia, and Miller because of their speech, our analysis
of their claims ends here.  But, because Hodgson proffered a non-speech based reason for Presby's suspension, we must analyze
Presby's claim at step three.</span></p>

as opposed to the word of two others.  While an employer is not
prohibited from crediting one person's report of an incident over
others, context matters.  Here, the one person happened to be a
member of management, while the two others were active union
members.  Along with the other evidence of pretext, the jury was
entitled to consider whether acceptance of one version over the
other revealed a desire to punish Presby for his roll call speech
under the guise of something else.  At the least, the conflicting
evidence in these circumstances should have prompted further

evidenced by both the administrator's oral report to Hodgson --
coming eleven days after the alleged incident, as well as by the
administrator's late written report -- filed a month and a half
after the same incident, casts more doubt on the investigation's
integrity.  Even absent any charge of collusion, the fact that the
discipline decsion relied on substantially delayed reports, rife
with all the risks of faulty memory, again calls into question the
true motive for using the incident as grounds for suspension. </span></p>

Presby, the supervisor and Hodgson himself, establishing the
absence of other investigations of, and punishments for, similar
incidents.  Presby testified that although the door had been left
open on a number of prior occasions, no one had been punished in
connection with those incidents.  To be sure, past wrongs do not
make a right, and conceivably Hodgson could have decided to step up
enforcement.  However, both Hodgson and the supervisor testified
that, despite the fact that the same administrator reported another
door being left open, Hodgson chose not to pursue an investigation
of that incident.  This inference of selective enforcement bolsters
Presby's theory that Hodgson used the door incident as a pretext in
order to retaliate against Presby for his protected speech.</span></p>

investigations and suspensions, as well as the reliance on late
reports from a person in the management ranks in the face of
contradicting evidence, was sufficient to shift the burden to
Hodgson and require him to prove that Presby would have been
suspended even in the absence of his protected conduct.  For his
part, Hodgson pointed to the report detailing the administrator's 
observations to justify the disciplinary decision.  A reasonable
jury could have found that this was not enough. </span></p>

It follows, the argument goes, that the jury's verdict in favor of
Morris on <i>his</i> MCRA claim was erroneous and inconsistent with the
verdicts in Hodgson's favor under &sect; 1983.  Hodgson also argues that
the MCRA requires Morris to establish that Hodgson interfered with

coercion," and that Morris failed to prove the existence of one of

a finding of qualified immunity is irrelevant to Morris's MCRA claim
because the claim is based on a separate incident in which Hodgson
was not acting under the "color of state law," a necessary
ingredient for qualified immunity.  Specifically, they cite an
incident where  Hodgson confronted Morris outside the correctional
facility and chastised him for not wearing a hat.  If Hodgson was
not acting under the color of state law, they argue, he could not
avail himself of the qualified immunity defense.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">See</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">Burke</span> v. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Town

plaintiffs argue that Morris proved Hodgson interfered with his
constitutional rights by "threats, intimidation, or coercion" by

because, even though the MCRA claim may be thought of as a state law
analogue to the federal &sect; 1983 claim, and even though courts have
held the same qualified immunity standard applies to both laws, the
MCRA does not require state action.</span>

we have examined the totality of the circumstances, to determine
whether the "state actor's conduct occurs in the course of
performing an actual or apparent duty of his office, or...is such
that the actor could not have behaved in that way but for the
authority of his office."  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Martinez</span> v. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Colon</span>, 54 F.3d 980, 986 (1st
Cir. 1995).  Admittedly, a finding that Hodgson was not acting
"under the color of law" during this incident required the jury to
engage in mental gymnastics.  For one thing, looked at in isolation
there is little evidence in the record about the hat incident, and
the facts that are present, such as the fact that the incident
occurred in the vicinity of the correctional facility, seem to cut
against a finding of no state action.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">See</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">Zambrana-Marrero</span> v.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Suarez-Cruz</span>, 172 F.3d 122, 125 (1st Cir. 1999)(noting location of
incident relevant to analysis).  Nevertheless, the jury could have
found that Hodgson, when chastising Morris for not wearing his hat,
was not enforcing any official duties given that departmental 
policy, according to testimony at trial, did not require Morris to
wear a hat.  In the end, we accord the jury's conclusion respect,
especially since determining whether a defendant acted under color
of state law can often be "particularly elusive," <span style="text-decoration: underline">id.</span>, and reminding
ourselves of our duty to read the jury's verdicts consistently if
possible.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">See</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">Malm</span> v. <span style="text-decoration: underline">United States Lines Co.</span>, 269 F. Supp. 731,

establish "threats, intimidation or coercion," -- the jury could
have reasonably found that Hodgson's behavior towards Morris
amounted to intimidation, and thus that Morris met one of the three
additional requirements under the MCRA.  The Massachusetts Supreme
Judicial Court has defined "intimidation" as "putting in fear for
the purpose of compelling or deterring conduct."  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Planned Parenthood
League of Mass. Inc.</span> v. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Blake</span>, 417 Mass. 467, 474 (1994) (citations

Hodgson, "spun the wheels of his car," before getting out of the car
and confronting him in an "aggressive, angry, and arrested" manner. 
Morris also testified that Hodgson's behavior intimidated him. 
Given that Morris held a position on the negotiating subcommittee,
the jury could have rationally concluded that Hodgson intended to
intimidate  Morris in order to frustrate his associational rights. 
Accordingly, we affirm the verdict in favor of Morris on his MCRA
claim.</span></p>

identity of the parties and the fact that the decision pertained to
the same incidents that gave rise to this federal action.  The judge
was entitled to take that value into account.  Moreover, the
admission of the decision did not unfairly prejudice Hodgson.  As
