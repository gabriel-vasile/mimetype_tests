The Kingdom of Guatemala (so known since 1549) 
was the political heart of Spanish rule in Central America, and had its largest
   population. Guatemala declared independence from Spain in 1821, 
along with the other Central American countries. The region has not been free of
   political unrest, and the quality of volcano reporting has varied in space and time. ...
 

<p>
<dd>
      Most active volcanoes in the Mexico/Central American Region occur in belts produced by subduction of 
Pacific oceanic crust beneath the southern edge of the North
   American Plate and the western edge of the Caribbean Plate. 
Large stratovolcanoes and silicic calderas are found here, but the region also contains
   many basaltic volcanic fields, particularly in the central valley of 
Mexico and along the Guatemala-El Salvador border. 
A few other active volcanoes in
   northern Mexico are related to extensional tectonics of the Basin and Range Province, 
which split the Baja California peninsula from the mainland. ...

<p>
<dd>
The explosive eruption of
   Guatemala's <b>Santa Maria volcano</b> in 1902 was one of the world's largest 20th-century eruptions. ...

<b>Acatenango,</b> 

along with its twin volcano to the south, 

<b>Volcan Fuego</b>, 

overlooks the historic former capital city of Antigua Guatemala. 

Acatenango,
   which has two principal summits, 
was constructed during three eruptive periods post-dating the roughly 85,000 year old <b>Los Chocoyos tephra</b> from
   
<b>Atitlan caldera</b>. An ancestral Acatenango volcano collapsed to the south, prior to the formation of Fuego volcano, forming the 
<b>La Democracia debris-avalanche deposit</b>, 

which covers a wide area of the Pacific coastal plain. Construction of <b>Yepocapa</b>, the northern summit of Acatenango, was
   completed about 20,000 years ago, after which growth of the southern and highest cone, <b>Pico Central (also known as Pico Mayor)</b>, 
began. The first
   well-documented eruptions of Acatenango took place from 1924 to 1927, although earlier historical eruptions may have occurred. 
Francisco Vasquez,
   writing in 1690, noted that in 1661 a volcano which lay aside of Fuego "opened a smoking mouth and still gives off smoke from another three, but
   without noise."

The <b>Fuego-Acatenango massif</b> comprises a string of five or more volcanic vents along a 
north-south trend that is perpendicular to that of the Central
American arc in Guatemala. From north to south known centers of volcanism are 
<b>Ancient Acatenango</b>, <b>Yepocapa</b>, <b>Pico Mayor de Acatenango</b>,
<b>Meseta</b>, and <b>Fuego</b>. Volcanism along the trend stretches back more than 200,000 years. 
Although many of the centers have been active
contemporaneously, there is a general sequence of younger volcanism, from north to south along the trend. 

<p>
<dd>
This massive volcano complex towers more than 3,500 meters above the 
Pacific coastal plain to the south and 2,000 meters above the Guatemalan
Highlands to the north. The volcano complex comprises remnants of 
multiple eruptive centers, which periodically have collapsed to form huge debris
avalanches. The largest of these avalanches extended more than 
50 kilometers from its source and covered more than 300 square kilometers. The
volcano has potential to produce huge debris avalanches that could 
inundate large areas of the Pacific coastal plain. In areas around the volcanoes and
downslope toward the coastal plain,more than 100,000 people are 
potentially at risk from these and other flowage phenomena.  ...


<p>
<dd>
The only known historical eruptions of Acatenango volcano occurred in the 20th century, 
between 1924 and 1927 from just north of the summit peak
(Pico Mayor) and again in December 1972 from the saddle between 
Yepocapa and Pico Mayor. These phreatic explosions generated ballistic bombs
that fell near the summit craters and fine ash that fell up to 
25 kilometers away. In prehistoric time, Acatenango has erupted explosively to form
widespread fall deposits, hot pyroclastic flows and lava flows. 
There have been numerous eruptions during the past 80,000 years from vents along the
massif. The most recent explosive eruptions of Acatenango occurred 1,900 years ago (Pico Mayor), 
2,300 years ago (Pico Mayor) and about 5000
years ago (Yepocapa). If such eruptions were to recur, many people and costly infrastructure would be at risk.

<dl>
<dd>
At 3,760 meters, <b>Agua volcano</b> towers more
than 3,500 meters above the Pacific coastal plain
to the south and 2,000 meters above the
Guatemalan highlands to the north.
The volcano is within 5 to 10
kilometers of Antigua, Guatemala and
several other large towns situated on its
northern apron. These towns have a
combined population of nearly 100,000.
It is within about 20 kilometers of Escuintla
(population,ca .100,000) to the south.
Though the volcano has not been active in
historical time, or about the
last 500 years, it has the potential to
produce debris flows (watery flows of mud,
rock,and debris -- also known as lahars
when they occur on a volcano) that could
inundate these nearby populated areas.

<b>Pacaya Volcano</b> and <b>Amatitl&aacute;n Caldera</b>

The <b>Amatitl&aacute;n</b> area has been identified by Koch and McLean (1975) and Wunderman

least nine major pyroclastic deposits, with a total volume of more than 70 cubic kilometers
(dense rock equivalent), were emplaced between about 300,000 years and 23,000 years B.P.
(Wunderman and Rose, 1984).  Wunderman and Rose (1984) inferred an <b>Amatitl&aacute;n

<b>Volcanism in Guatemala</b> results from 

<a href="http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Glossary/PlateTectonics/framework.html">
subduction</a>

of the <b>Cocos plate</b> beneath the <b>Caribbean plate</b>.

The modern <b>Atitlan Caldera</b> is thought to have formed at the intersection of a northeast-southwest-trending fossil boundary between the
western and central Guatemala segments of Cocos-Caribbean subduction and the modern volcanic front (Newhall, 1987).  Today, the principal faults of
the Atitlan area are right-lateral northwest-southeast strike-slip faults, conjugate left-lateral northeast-southwest strike-slip faults, and an
inferred north-south tension fracture that is defined by a north-south alignment of the modern 

<a href="http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Glossary/StratoVolcano/framework.html">
stratovolcanoes</a>.  

The modern 

<a href="http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Glossary/Caldera/framework.html">
caldera</a> is about 35 kilometers south of the Motagua (middle) part of the boundary between the Caribbean and North American plates.

<p>
<dd>
Three large 

<a href="http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Glossary/Caldera/framework.html">
calderas</a>

have formed in the Atitlan region in the past 14 million years (Newhall, 1987).  The modern Atitlan (III) Caldera formed approximately 84,000 years
ago, shortly after an eruption of about 250 cubic kilometers of rhyolitic magma (Koch and McLean, 1975; Hahn and others, 1979; Drexler and others,
1980; Rose and others, 1987; Newhall, 1987).  Three postcaldera 

<a href="http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Glossary/StratoVolcano/framework.html">
stratovolcanoes</a>

-- <b>Vulcan San Pedro</b>, 
<b>Vulcan Toliman</b>, 
and 
<b>Vulcan Atitlan</b> --
have grown on or just inside the southern boundary of the caldera (Rose and others, 1980).

<p>
<dd>
The first recorded eruption of <b>Atitlan</b> was in 1469 (von Seebach, 1892).  The volcano "awoke" in 1717 and remained "active" until 1721
(Sapper, 1925).  Other eruptions occurred ... (1469, 1717-21, 1826-28, 1833?, 1837, 1843?, 1852?-53, 1856?); 
the only strong eruption among these was on 3 May 1853, when ash darkened the sky
around <b>Lake Atitlan</b> from 1100 to 1400 hours (Sapper, 1925).






<p>
<dd>
Aside from the eruptions of <b>Vulcan Atitlan</b>, little is known about unrest at <b>Atitlan Caldera</b>.  Seismicity has been low during the past
decade or more (White and Harlow, 1979, 1980; Harlow and White, 1980).  There is a hint of relatively long-period fluctuations in lake level; the
lake level was reportedly low in the 1820's, 10-15 meters higher in the 1870's, back down to its low level in the 1920's, and high again from the
1940's to the present <i>(web note, report published in 1988)</i>.  Most fluctuation is a result of variation in annual rainfall or the effects of
regional earthquakes on the subsurface drainage from the lake; it is not known whether any uplift and subsidence of the caldera floor is involved. 
Short-term changes in lake level that are attributable to rainfall may be as great as the increase of 3.3 meters during the exceptionally wet year
of 1933; those attributable to earthquakes may be as great as the drop of 2 meters that occurred within one month following the <b>Guatemala
earthquake</b> (magnitude=7.5) of 4 February 1976 (Newhall and others, 1987).  Sediments of the lake floor suggest episodic, decades-long increases
in sublacustrine thermal activity: alternating decades-long periods with and without annual lake overturn are interpreted as periods of relatively
high and low activity of fumaroles on the caldera floor (Newhall and others, 1987).

which extends about 50 kilometers onto the Pacific coastal plain.
   Growth of the modern Fuego volcano followed, continuing the southward 
migration of volcanism that began at Acatenango. Frequent vigorous historical

along with occasional pyroclastic flows and lava flows.

In historical time, Fuego has erupted more than 60 times. It has spread 
volcanic ash to population centers such as Escuintla (population 75,000+) 20
kilometers to the south, Antiqua (population 25,000) 15 kilometers to the 
southwest and Guatemala City (population 2.2 million), the country's capital
and largest city, 40 kilometers to the southwest. The volcano commonly
 produces plumes of fine ash up to 10 kilometers high, lava flows, and hot
pyroclastic flows. During periods of rain, volcaniclastic debris remobilizes 
to form volcanic debris flows (also commonly known as lahars). After
periods of volcanism, channels are choked with sediment. As a result, 
floods spill onto adjacent interfluves, and periodically river channels change their
course.

<b>Pacaya</b> sits 30 kilometers south of the center of Guatemala City, 
an urban center with a population of more than 1.5 million. A 1989 eruption produced a
   4.5-kilometer-tall eruption column and enlarged the 
<b>MacKenney crater</b>. 
Lava flows followed in 1990-91. Strong eruptive activity in June-August 1991 destroyed
   part of the MacKenney cone and damaged villages to the west. 
Lavas have often flowed out of the collapsed south-southwest sector, traveling away from most
   inhabited areas. 
The international airport (La Aurora) lies ~23 kilometers from the crater and airplanes commonly fly over the volcano. 
 
<p>
<dd>     Eruptions from <b>Pacaya</b>, one of Guatemala's most active volcanoes, 
are frequently visible from Guatemala City, the nation's capital. Pacaya is a
   complex volcano constructed on the southern rim of the 14 x 16 kilometers 
Pleistocene <b>Amatitlan caldera</b>. A cluster of 

<a href="http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Glossary/Domes/framework.html">
dacitic lava domes</a> 

occupies the caldera floor. The Pacaya massif includes the 

<b>Cerro Grande lava dome</b> and a younger volcano to the southwest. 
Collapse of Pacaya volcano about 1,100
   years ago produced a debris-avalanche deposit that extends 25 kilometers 
onto the Pacific coastal plain and left an arcuate somma rim inside which the
   modern Pacaya volcano (MacKenney cone) grew. A subsidiary crater, <b>Cerro Chino</b>, 
was constructed on the northwest somma rim. During the past several
   decades, activity at Pacaya has consisted of frequent 
strombolian eruptions with intermittent lava flow extrusion on the flanks of MacKenney cone,
   punctuated by occasional larger explosive eruptions.

One of the largest eruptions of the 20th century occurred at <b>Santa Mar&iacute;a in 1902</b>. 
The eruption left a 700 x 1,000 meter crater in the 
<a href="http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Glossary/StratoVolcano/framework.html">
stratovolcano's</a>

southwest flank. 
Growth of a 

<a href="http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Glossary/Domes/framework.html">
dacite dome</a> 

called 

<b>Santiaguito</b> 


began in this crater in 1922. The largest pyroclastic flow since 1922 took place in 1929 and killed
   from hundreds to as many as 5,000 persons. 
During the next three eruptive pulses the active vent migrated west from a vent called <b>Caliente</b> to vents
   named <b>La Mitad</b> (1939-42), <b>El Monje</b> (1949-55), and <b>El Bruje</b> (1959-63).

<p>
<dd> 
       The symmetrical, forest-covered <b>Santa Mar&iacute;a volcano</b> 

is one of a chain of large stratovolcanoes that rises dramatically above the Pacific coastal
   plain of Guatemala. The stratovolcano has a sharp-topped, conical profile that is cut on the southwest 
flank by a large, 1-kilometer-wide crater, which formed during
   a catastrophic eruption in 1902 and extends from just below the summit to the lower flank. 
The renowned plinian eruption of 1902 followed a long
   repose period and devastated much of southwest Guatemala. The large dacitic 

<b>Santiaguito lava-dome complex</b> has been growing at the base of the 1902
   crater since 1922. Compound dome growth at Santiaguito has occurred episodically from four westward-younging vents, accompanied by almost
   continuous minor explosions and periodic lava extrusion, larger explosions, pyroclastic flows, and lahars.
