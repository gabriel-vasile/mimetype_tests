                        principal tourist sites most frequented by visitors from the United States are generally good to excellent.&nbsp; A peace accord,
                        signed in 1996, ended a 36-year armed conflict.&nbsp; Violent crime, however, is a serious concern due to endemic poverty, an abundance

                        return to the U.S.&nbsp; Even if dual nationals are permitted to enter Guatemala on a second nationality passport, U.S. citizens
                        returning to the United States from Guatemala are not allowed to board their flights without a valid U.S. passport.&nbsp; Certificates
                        of Naturalization, birth certificates, driver's licenses, and photocopies are not accepted by Guatemalan authorities as alternative
                        travel documents.&nbsp; While in Guatemala, U.S. citizens should carry their passports, or a photocopy of their passports, with
                        them at all times.
                     </p>
                     <p>An exit tax must be paid when departing Guatemala by air.&nbsp; The exit tax (currently $30) is generally included in an airline
                        ticket price, but may be charged separately.&nbsp; There is an additional airport security fee (20 Quetzales, approximately $2.50)
                        that all travelers must pay at the airport.&nbsp;
                     </p>
                     <p>Minors under 18 traveling with a valid U.S. passport need no special permission from their parents to enter or leave Guatemala.&nbsp;
                        U.S. citizens do not need a visa for a stay of 90 days or less (that period can be extended for an additional 180 days upon
                        application to Guatemalan immigration).&nbsp;
                     </p>
                     <p>A U.S. citizen whose passport is lost or stolen in Guatemala must obtain a new passport at the U.S. Embassy as soon as possible
                        and present it, together with a police report of the loss or theft, to the Direcci&oacute;n de Migraci&oacute;n (Guatemalan immigration
                        agency), Sub-director de Control Migratorio (Sub-director for Migratory Control), to obtain permission to depart Guatemala.&nbsp;
                        The agency is located in Guatemala City at 6 Avenida 3-11, Zone 4, Guatemala City.&nbsp; Office hours are weekdays from 8:00 a.m.
                        to 4:00 p.m.; telephone 2411-2411.&nbsp; No fee is charged by Guatemalan immigration for this service.
                     </p>
                     <p>In June 2006, Guatemala entered a &#8220;Central America-4 (CA-4) Border Control Agreement&#8221; with El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua.
                        Under the terms of the agreement, citizens of the four countries may travel freely across land borders from one of the countries
                        to any of the others without completing entry and exit formalities at Immigration checkpoints. U.S. citizens and other eligible
                        foreign nationals, who legally enter any of the four countries, may similarly travel among the four without obtaining additional
                        visas or tourist entry permits for the other three countries. Immigration officials at the first port of entry determine the
                        length of stay, up to a maximum period of 90 days.&nbsp;&nbsp; Foreign tourists who wish to remain in the region beyond the period initially
                        granted for their visit are required to request a one-time extension of stay from local Immigration authorities in the country
                        where the traveler is physically present, or travel outside the CA-4 countries and reapply for admission to the region. Foreigners
                        &#8220;expelled&#8221; from any of the four countries are excluded from the entire &#8220;CA-4&#8221; region.&nbsp; In isolated cases, the lack of clarity
                        in the implementing details of the CA-4 Border Control Agreement has caused temporary inconvenience to travelers.

                     The police force is inexperienced and under-funded, and the judicial system is weak, overworked, and inefficient.&nbsp; Well-armed
                     criminals know there is little chance they will be caught or punished.&nbsp; Traditionally, Guatemala experiences increases in
                     crime before and during the Christmas and Easter holiday seasons. 
                     <p>Large demonstrations occur throughout Guatemala, often with little or no notice, and can cause serious traffic disruptions.&nbsp;
                        Although most demonstrations are peaceful, they can turn violent, and travelers should avoid areas where demonstrations are
                        taking place.&nbsp; The use of roadblocks and/or blocking of public facilities, including the international airport, has increased
                        and demonstrators may prevent tourists caught behind the blockades from leaving.
                     </p>
                     <p>In 2007 particularly virulent rumors of child stealing and of murder for organ harvesting have been reported in several different
                        areas of Guatemala frequented by American tourists.&nbsp;&nbsp; This year numerous &nbsp;Guatemalan citizens have been lynched for suspicion
                        of child stealing, and three local women who allegedly&nbsp; facilitated foreign adoptions were attacked by a mob that accused
                        them of kidnapping and killing a girl whose mutilated remains were found near Camotan, Chiquimula (near the Honduran border
                        on the main road leading to the Copan Mayan ruins).&nbsp;&nbsp; In reaction to unconfirmed reports of babies being kidnapped in the
                        El Golfete area of the Rio Dulce (near Livingston, Izabal), residents of small villages in the area remain mobilized and suspicious
                        of all outsiders, including foreigners.
                     </p>
                     <p>Also in 2007, two foreigners (including an American citizen) and a Guatemalan kayaking on a river near Chicaman, Quiche were
                        accused of stealing children and seized by a mob estimated at 500 persons.&nbsp; Although threatened, the individuals were not
                        physically attacked.&nbsp; The incident occurred after the group talked and joked with a local boy on the river bank. In Sayaxche,
                        Pet&eacute;n, child stealing rumors escalated into mob action against a Guatemalan couple believed to be involved in child stealing.&nbsp;
                        The husband was beaten and burned to death, and the wife threatened, but eventually turned over to the police. A local American
                        resident was also seized and threatened with death when he tried to intervene with the mob. &nbsp;A family of American tourists,
                        along with several Guatemalan motorists, was held overnight at a road blockade in the same area for possible use as human
                        shields.&nbsp; Mobs have also targeted police, resulting in delayed or ineffective responses by law enforcement. &nbsp;&nbsp;
                     </p>
                     <p>Due to uncontrolled drug and alien smuggling, the Guatemalan border with Mexico is a relatively high-risk area, in particular
                        in the northern Peten Department.&nbsp; The most dangerous area in that region is on the northwestern border in the area that includes
                        the Sierra de Lacandon and Laguna del Tigre National Parks.&nbsp;Extra precautions are required when U.S. Government personnel
                        travel to the region.
                     </p>
                     <p>The following recommendations will help residents and visitors alike to increase their safety:</p>
                     <p>Avoid gatherings of agitated people. &nbsp;Frustration over crime and a lack of appropriate judicial remedies has led to violent
                        incidents of vigilantism, including lynchings, especially in more isolated, rural areas.&nbsp; Attempting to intervene may put
                        you at risk of attacks from mobs.
                     </p>
                     <p>Avoid close contact with children, including taking photographs, especially in rural areas.&nbsp; Such contact can be viewed with
                        deep alarm and may provoke panic and violence.&nbsp;
                     </p>
                     <p>Keep informed of possible demonstrations by following the local news and consulting hotel personnel and tour guides.&nbsp; Avoid
                        areas where demonstrations are occurring.
                     </p>
                     <p>Beware of strong currents, riptides, and undertow along Guatemala's Pacific Coast beaches.&nbsp; They pose a serious threat to
                        even the strongest swimmers.&nbsp; Signs warning of treacherous surf are rare and confined mostly to private beaches owned by hotels.&nbsp;
                        Lifeguards are rarely present on beaches.
                     </p>
                     <p>Tourists planning to climb Pacaya and Agua volcanoes during Guatemala's rainy season (May through October) should plan their
                        climb for the morning hours, when it is less likely that thunderstorms will occur.&nbsp; Climbers should monitor the weather situation
                        and return to the base of the volcano as quickly as safely possible if thunderstorms gather.&nbsp; In 2003, a Canadian tourist
                        was killed by lightning while climbing Pacaya.&nbsp; INGUAT, the Guatemalan Tourist Institute,&nbsp;has organized an active community-based
                        tourism program in San Vicente Pacaya to minimize the risk of armed robbery on Pacaya. Climbing in groups is still highly
                        advisable for any volcano climb to reduce the risk of assault.

                     <p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p><b><a id="#crime" name="#crime"></a>CRIME:</b>&nbsp; The number of violent crimes reported by U.S. citizens and other foreigners has remained high in recent years.&nbsp; Incidents
                     include, but are not limited to, assault, theft, armed robbery, carjacking, rape, kidnapping, and murder.&nbsp; Criminals often
                     operate in groups of four or more and are confrontational and violent.&nbsp; Gangs are a growing concern in Guatemala City and
                     rural Guatemala.&nbsp; Gang members are often well armed with sophisticated weaponry and they sometimes use massive amounts of
                     force.&nbsp; Emboldened armed robbers have attacked vehicles on main roads in broad daylight.&nbsp; Travel on rural roads always increases
                     the risk of a criminal roadblock or ambush.&nbsp; Widespread narcotics and alien smuggling activities can make remote areas especially
                     dangerous.&nbsp; Though there is no evidence that Americans are particularly targeted, criminals look for every opportunity to
                     attack, so all travelers should remain constantly vigilant. 
                     <p>Most tourists and visitors travel throughout Guatemala without mishap. However, violent criminal activity on the highways
                        continues, and tourists, among others, have been targeted. Many of the robbery attempts have occurred in daylight hours on
                        main highways. Carjacking incidents and highway robberies are often violent. Four Americans were killed in highway robbery
                        attempts in 2002 and three killed and one wounded in 2003. In 2004 one American tourist was murdered, and women and children
                        were raped in highway assaults. Several highway assaults of American citizens also took place in 2005, but without serious
                        injury to the victims. In 2006, there were 19 incidents of assault against Americans in motor vehicles reported to the Embassy,
                        none of which involved death or injury.&nbsp; In nine of these incidents, the victims were arriving at Guatemala City's airport.&nbsp;
                     </p>
                     <p>In 2007 there has been an increasing number of carjacking incidents and armed robberies of travelers who have just arrived
                        on international flights, most frequently between 6:00 a.m and 10:00 am, but also in the evening (see list of Recent Crime
                        Incidents Involving Foreigners on the Embassy website for more specifics). In the most common scenario tourists or business
                        travelers who land at the airport around 7:00 am are held up by armed men as their vehicle departs the airport. Private vehicles,
                        taxis and shuttle buses have been attacked. Typically, the assailants steal money, passports, and luggage, and in some but
                        not all cases, the assailants steal the vehicle as well.&nbsp; Recently, many of these attacks have taken place far from the airport,
                        just as travelers arrived at their homes, or in less busy areas of the city. &nbsp;Laptops are frequently targeted, so carry them
                        inconspicuously in a backpack or other carryon luggage.&nbsp; Victims who did not resist the attackers were not physically injured.
                        The Embassy advises its own employees to seek alternative routes for exiting the airport.
                     </p>
                     <p>In some cases, assailants have been wearing full or partial police uniforms and have used vehicles that resemble police vehicles,
                        indicating that some elements of the police might be involved. Armed robberies have occurred within minutes of the tourist&#8217;s
                        vehicle being stopped by the police. U.S. Embassy personnel continue to observe heightened security precautions in Guatemala
                        City and on the roads outside the capital city. U.S. tourists are urged to be especially aware of safety and security concerns
                        when traveling on the roads in Guatemala. Rather than traveling alone, use a reputable tour organization. Stay in groups;
                        travel in a caravan consisting of two or more vehicles; and, stay on the main roads. Ensure that someone not traveling with
                        you is aware of your itinerary. Resist the temptation to stay in hotels that do not have adequate security. Travel after dark
                        anywhere in Guatemala is extremely dangerous. It is preferable to stay in the main tourist destinations. Do not explore back
                        roads or isolated paths near tourist sites. Pay close attention to your surroundings, especially when walking or when driving
                        in Guatemala City. Refrain from displaying expensive-looking jewelry, large amounts of money, laptop computers, or other valuable
                        items. Finally, if confronted by criminals, be aware that resistance may provoke a more violent response.
                     </p>
                     <p>Avoid low-priced intra- and inter-city buses (recycled U.S. school buses); they are often attacked by armed robbers and are
                        poorly maintained and dangerously driven. More than 100 bus drivers and passengers died in 2006 in robberies staged by holdup
                        gangs that target public transportation, both urban and inter-city.&nbsp; The use of modern inter-city buses somewhat improves
                        security and safety. There have been, however, several attacks on travelers on first-class buses on highway CA-2 near the
                        border areas with both Mexico and El Salvador and on highways CA-1 and CA-9 near the El Salvador border and in the highlands
                        between Quetzaltenango and Solol&aacute;. Be cautious with personal items such as backpacks, fanny packs, and passports while riding
                        buses, because tourists&#8217; possessions are a favorite target of thieves.
                     </p>
                     <p>Foreign residents of Guatemala have special concerns. Since December 1999, when the Government of Guatemala appointed a Special
                        Prosecutor to investigate all American citizen murders, twenty-four American citizen residents and&nbsp; six American citizen tourists
                        have been murdered, and suspects have been convicted in only two cases. &nbsp;There have been &#8220;express&#8221; kidnappings in recent years,
                        primarily in Guatemala City, in which a relatively small ransom that can be quickly gathered is demanded. U.S. citizens have
                        been kidnapped in recent years. At least one incident of a random kidnapping, in which the victim was grabbed off the street
                        in an affluent neighborhood of the city, occurred in December 2003 and resulted in a physical and sexual assault.
                     </p>
                     <p>Pickpockets and purse-snatchers are active in all major cities and tourist sites, especially the central market and other
                        parts of Zone 1 in Guatemala City and the city of Antigua.&nbsp; In a common scenario, an accomplice distracts the victim, while
                        an assailant slashes or simply steals a bag or backpack while the victim&#8217;s attention is diverted.
                     </p>
                     <p>As in other countries, criminals also use a number of scams to steal money and possessions from tourists in Guatemala.&nbsp; In
                        one popular scam, robbers place a nail in a parked vehicle&#8217;s tire.&nbsp; The vehicle is then followed by the robbers who pose as
                        &#8220;good Samaritans&#8221; when the tire becomes flat and the victims pull to the side of the road.&nbsp; While &#8220;help&#8221; is being rendered,
                        the contents of the car are stolen, often without the knowledge of the victims.&nbsp; However, in some cases, the robbers have
                        threatened the tourists with weapons.&nbsp; Parking areas in and around the Guatemala City International Airport are particularly
                        prone to this crime.&nbsp; In another scam, victims are approached in a hotel, restaurant or other public place by an individual
                        claiming there is some sort of problem with his or the would-be victim&#8217;s automobile in the parking lot.&nbsp; On the way to investigate
                        the &#8220;problem,&#8221; usually in a remote or concealed area near the parking lot, the robber pulls a gun on the victim demanding
                        cash, credit cards and other valuables.&nbsp; A third popular scam involves various attempts to acquire a victim&#8217;s ATM card and
                        PIN number.&nbsp; Some sophisticated criminals have even placed boxes outside ATM kiosks that record PIN numbers when unsuspecting
                        victims believe they must enter their PIN number to gain entry to the ATM foyer.&nbsp; After recording PIN numbers, robbers then
                        steal the owner&#8217;s ATM card to complete their crime.&nbsp; There are dozens of techniques scammers can use to rob victims of money
                        and possessions.&nbsp; While most people mean no harm, always be cautious when strangers approach you for any reason or make unusual
                        requests.
                     </p>
                     <p>Parents adopting children in Guatemala have also been victimized in public places and at their hotels by police (or individuals
                        dressed as police) who have threatened to arrest foster mothers and turn adoptive children over to orphanages, but released
                        them in exchange for significant payments, often approaching $1000.&nbsp; Such threats have no basis in Guatemalan law, and should
                        be immediately reported to the Embassy.&nbsp;
                     </p>
                     <p>For security reasons, the Embassy does not allow U.S. government employees to stay in hotels in Zone 1 in Guatemala City and
                        urges private travelers to avoid staying in this area&nbsp; Do not hail taxis on the street in Guatemala City.&nbsp; Use radio-dispatched
                        taxis or taxis from major hotels instead.
                     </p>
                     <p>The main road to Lake Atitlan via the Inter-American Highway (CA-1) and Solola is safer than the alternatives, though attacks
                        in recent years have made traveling in a caravan highly recommended, even on the Inter-American Highway.&nbsp; Robbery and assault
                        have been frequently reported on secondary roads near the lake with the highest number of incidents occurring on the RN-11
                        (Las Trampas road) parallel to the east side of the lake.&nbsp; Robbers have used mountain roads advantageously to stop buses,
                        vans and cars in a variety of ways.
                     </p>
                     <p>Armed attacks have occurred on roads from Guatemala City to the Peten.&nbsp; Visitors to the Mayan ruins at Tikal are urged to
                        fly to nearby Flores and then travel by bus or tour van to the site.&nbsp; Violent attacks have occurred in the Mayan ruins in
                        the Peten, including in the Cerro Cahui Conservation Park, Yaxha, the road to and inside Tikal Park, and in the Tikal ruins.&nbsp;
                        Tourist police (POLITUR) patrols inside the park have significantly reduced the violent crime incidents inside the park, but
                        travelers should nevertheless remain in groups and on the principal trails leading to the Central Plaza and the Temple IV
                        complex, and avoid remote areas of the park.
                     </p>
                     <p>POLITUR (a joint police/Guatemalan Tourism Institute initiative) is present in all major tourist destinations.&nbsp; They should
                        be contacted in case of any criminal incident in such areas, even if minor.

                     <p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p><b><a id="#traffic_safety" name="#traffic_safety"></a>TRAFFIC SAFETY AND ROAD CONDITIONS:</b>&nbsp; While in a foreign country, U.S. citizens may encounter road conditions that differ significantly from those in the United
                     States.&nbsp; The information below concerning Guatemala is provided for general reference only, and may not be totally accurate
                     in a particular location or circumstance. 
                     <p>Driving in Guatemala requires one's full attention, and safe drivers must take extraordinary efforts to drive defensively
                        to avoid dangerous situations.
                     </p>
                     <p>Traffic rules are only casually observed.&nbsp; Many drivers do not use their turn signals to alert other drivers.&nbsp; Instead, a
                        common custom is for a driver or passenger to stick a hand out the window and wave it to indicate that they will be taking
                        an unspecified action.&nbsp; Speed limits, lane markings and stop signs are frequently ignored.&nbsp; Passing blindly on winding and/or
                        steep mountain roads, poorly designed surfaces, and unmarked hazards, including frequent landslides and precarious temporary
                        highway repairs, present additional risks to motorists.&nbsp;
                     </p>
                     <p>Common public transportation is by local recycled school busses, which serve every town in the country.&nbsp; Criminal activity
                        and frequent fatal accidents, however, make the low-priced inter-city buses particularly dangerous.&nbsp; Modern inter-city buses
                        offer some security from highway violence, but armed attacks are increasing, showing that all buses are vulnerable.&nbsp; (See
                        additional information in the <a href="http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1129.html#crime">CRIME</a> section.)
                     </p>
                     <p>Although city streets are lit, secondary and rural roads have little to no illumination.&nbsp; Driving outside of urban areas at
                        night is dangerous and not recommended.&nbsp; The Inter-American Highway (CA-1) and the road from Guatemala City to the Caribbean
                        coast (CA-9) are especially dangerous due to heavy traffic, including large trucks and trailers.&nbsp; There are no roadside assistance
                        clubs, however a roadside assistance force (PROVIAL) patrols most of the major highways in the country. PROVIAL can be contacted
                        by calling 2422-7878.&nbsp; Their vehicles are equipped with basic tools and first aid supplies, and their services are free.&nbsp;
                        Police patrol the major roadways and may assist travelers, but the patrols are sporadic and may be suspended due to budget
                        restraints.&nbsp; For roadside assistance, travelers may call the police by dialing 120 or the fire department by dialing 122 or
                        123.&nbsp; Cellular telephone service covers most areas frequented by tourists.
                     </p>
                     <p>Valid U.S. driver's licenses are accepted for the first 30 days of a visit, and international driving permits are accepted
                        in Guatemala for extended stays.&nbsp; Guatemala's road safety authorities are the Department of Transit and the Joint Operations
                        Center of the National Police.&nbsp; Drivers use the right-hand side of the road in Guatemala, and speed limits are posted (in
                        kilometers) depending on the condition of the road.&nbsp; Speed limits are different in rural and urban areas, but are rarely enforced.&nbsp;
                        Drivers often drive at the absolute maximum speed possible for the particular vehicle at the time.&nbsp; These drivers share the
                        road with slow vehicles, some barely able to manage 20 miles per hour, creating a hazardous mix of velocities.&nbsp; Turning right
                        on red is not permitted unless otherwise posted, and drivers must yield when entering a traffic circle.&nbsp; Seat belts must be
                        worn in Guatemala, but there are no laws regarding the use of child safety seats.&nbsp; It is against the law for drivers to operate
                        cellular phones while driving.
                     </p>
                     <p>People found driving under the influence of alcohol or other drugs are arrested and may serve jail time.&nbsp; In an accident resulting
                        in injury or death, every driver involved is taken into custody and the vehicle(s) impounded until a judge determines responsibility
                        in a re-enactment of the accident.

                        or one of Guatemala&#8217;s consulates in the United States for specific information regarding customs requirements.&nbsp; In many countries
                        around the world, counterfeit and pirated goods are widely available.&nbsp; Transactions involving such products are illegal and
                        bringing them back to the United States may result in forfeitures and/or fines.&nbsp;

                     <p>Non-Guatemalan citizens who wish to marry in Guatemala are required to provide proof of identity and civil status (indicating
                        whether they are single or divorced).&nbsp; Prior notice of the marriage must be given in the Diario de Centro America (Guatemala's
                        Official Record) and any large circulation daily newspaper for fifteen days.&nbsp; The marriage must take place within six months
                        of the publication of the notice.
                     </p><b>DISASTER PREPAREDNESS:</b>&nbsp; Guatemala is a geologically active country.&nbsp; Visitors should be aware of the possibility of earthquakes at any time and
                     the need for contingency plans.&nbsp; There are also four active volcanoes.&nbsp; Volcanic activity, such as that of Fuego Volcano near
                     Antigua in January 2003, and again in January 2006, has on occasion forced evacuations of nearby villages; the January-February
                     2000 activity of Pacaya Volcano near Guatemala City also briefly closed Guatemala City's international airport.&nbsp; Both the
                     Caribbean and Pacific coasts of Guatemala are also vulnerable to hurricanes and tropical storms from June through November.&nbsp;
                     Mudslides and flooding during the May to November rainy season often kill dozens of people and close roads.&nbsp; General information
                     about natural disaster preparedness is available via the Internet from the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)

                     from those in the United States and may not afford the protections available to the individual under U.S. law.&nbsp; Penalties
                     for breaking the law can be more severe than in the United States for similar offences.&nbsp; Persons violating Guatemalan laws,
                     even unknowingly, may be expelled, arrested or imprisoned.&nbsp; Penalties for possession, use, or trafficking in illegal drugs
                     in Guatemala are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines.&nbsp; Engaging in sexual conduct
                     with children or using or disseminating child pornography in a foreign country is a crime, prosecutable in the United States.&nbsp;
