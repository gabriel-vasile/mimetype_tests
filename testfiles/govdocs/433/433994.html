<p><font color="#000080">&nbsp;With a constant watch over the Western Hemisphere,
Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) are the first to detect wild
storms charging from the sea and pummeling continental coastlines. While weather-watching
may put GOES on the nightly news, the satellites&#146; value goes way beyond
tonight&#146;s weather report and tomorrow&#146;s forecast. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080">For years, scientists have taken advantage of the wide and
watchful eye of GOES to study all kinds of Earth issues, from erupting volcanoes to
climate-changing clouds.</font></p>
<b><u>

<p></u></b><big><big><font color="#000080">Can GOES predict a Volcanic Eruption?</font></big></big></p>

<p><font color="#000080">By using GOES as a long-distance thermometer, scientists from the
University of Hawaii saw signs of an impending volcanic eruption from space for the first
time in 1998. On May 20, a Guatemalan volcano named Pacaya erupted an ash cloud that
blanketed Guatemala City and the local airport 19 miles (30 kilometers) away. Luke Flynn,
a University of Hawaii volcanologist and his team of scientists saw it coming. Seven days
before the eruption, the volcano started to heat up. GOES saw the heat in the form of
radiation, and an automated computer system at the university acted as an eruption alarm
by picking the hot spot out of the satellite data.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000080">The advantage of using GOES to study volcanoes and other
&quot;hot spots&quot; like forest fires is that an image can be sent to the ground every
30 minutes. The near real-time data is a great benefit to hazard mitigation agencies. The
U.S. Geological Survey&#146;s Hawaii Volcano Observatory uses the University of Hawaii Hot
Spot Image web site: <a href="http://virtual1.pgd.hawaii.edu/goes/hawaii/latest.shtml">http://virtual1.pgd.hawaii.edu/goes/hawaii/latest.shtml
</a>to follow eruptions on Kilauea and Mauna Loa. Real time imagery for the continental
U.S. is available at: <a href="http://www.cira.colostate.edu/ramm/goes39/cover.htm">http://www.cira.colostate.edu/ramm/goes39/cover.htm.</a></font></p>
<b><u>

<p></u></b><big><big><font color="#000080">Can Airplanes Create Clouds and Cause the
Climate to Change? </font></big></big></p>

<p><font color="#000080">The ghostly white trails following airplanes and rockets through
the sky, called contrails, are probably adding to global warming, according to scientists
at NASA&#146;s Langley Research Center, Hampton, Va. Atmospheric scientist Patrick Minnis
uses GOES to track contrails that are formed when water vapor turns to ice in the exhaust
of aircraft and rockets. The contrails often turn into cirrus clouds, a thin, wispy type
of cloud made of ice crystals. While some clouds tend to help cool the globe and negate
the affects of global warming, thin cirrus clouds are heat trappers, holding in more heat
than they reflect back into space.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000080">Because clouds come and go with the wind, GOES&#146; clear,
constant perspective is the only way to keep tabs on the changing contrails. The Imager,
an instrument aboard GOES, can tell one cloud type from another by the cloud&#146;s
temperature, revealing to scientists which clouds are doing the heating, and which are
doing the cooling. The work is part of a NASA&#146;s Atmospheric Effects of Aviation
Project to study the global and regional affects of contrails and the clouds they form. <a

<p><font color="#000080">Another part of the aircraft-climate equation is pollution from
airplanes and rockets. Anne Thompson, an atmospheric scientist at NASA&#146;s Goddard
Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md., uses GOES to guide her research into the top of the
troposphere, the part of the atmosphere 5.5 to 7.5 miles (9-12 kilometers) above the
Earth. The sky over the Atlantic Ocean has become a superhighway for air traffic, and in
1997, Thompson tested the air there from a NASA DC-8 to see the affect of airliner exhaust
gov/ <a href="http://telsci.arc.nasa.gov/~sonex/">http://telsci.arc.nasa.gov/~sonex/</a>.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000080">But pollution can also get to the troposphere during a
thunderstorm, sending up man-made smog from below. GOES can identify where thunder clouds
are, helping Thompson tell where thunderstorms are causing the pollution, and where smog
is just the result of jet exhaust. Pollution in the troposphere is made up of gases that
can trap heat from the sun and add to global warming, said Thompson. So knowing how
airliners and rockets add to the picture is important for climate research. The study is
also part of NASA&#146;s Atmospheric Effects of Aviation Project.</font></p>
<b><u>

<p></u></b><big><big><font color="#000080">Climate and Clouds: What&#146;s the Connection?</font></big></big></p>

<p><font color="#000080">If temperatures rise globally, what will the affect be on clouds,
the Earth&#146;s natural shade-makers? Since 1995, NASA Goddard climate researcher Gyula
Molnar has used GOES to keep watch over low-lying stratus clouds blanketing the Eastern
Pacific Ocean along the Peruvian, Chilean, and Baja California coasts. When the climate
changed with El Niño in 1997 and the Eastern Pacific sea surface warmed up, the blanket
of clouds became thinner and full of larger holes, allowing more of the sun&#146;s heat to
further warm the ocean.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000080">Many climate scientists predict that sea surface temperatures
around the globe will heat up with man-made global warming. If marine stratus clouds
around the globe act like the clouds in the Eastern Pacific, the Earth&#146;s land and sea
surfaces could be in for a lot more heat during the predicted global warming. Molnar has
used GOES to get an update every three hours since 1995 on the extent and brightness of
clouds in the Eastern Pacific. Color GOES images of the Peru/Chile region can be found at:

<p></u></b><big><big><font color="#000080">The GOES Rain Gauge</font></big></big></p>

<p><font color="#000080">Andrew Negri, a Goddard research meteorologist, uses GOES to
determine the amount of rainfall over the Amazon, where there are very few rain gauges on
the ground. GOES uses its infrared sensor as a long distance thermometer and takes the
temperature of clouds. During summer thunderstorms, colder clouds produce more rain, so by
measuring the temperature of clouds with GOES, Negri can estimate how much rain is
falling. Some areas of the Amazon get up to 12-16 inches of rain a month.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000080">Rainfall in the Amazon is important because when water vapor
condenses into clouds and turns to rain, it warms up the tropical atmosphere. This heating
provides the fuel for the engine that drives the global circulation, affecting wind
patterns all over the globe. Using GOES as a rain gauge can also help with agriculture
(drought/soil moisture) in North America. NOAA uses GOES data in real time to monitor
flash-flood producing thunderstorms. More information can be found at this site: <a
href="http://rsd.gsfc.nasa.gov/912/code912"> http://rsd.gsfc.nasa.gov/912/code912</a></font></p>

<p><font color="#000080">Real-time precipitation estimates for the U.S. from the GOES
satellite are available every half hour at: <a
href="http://orbit-net.nesdis.noaa.gov/arad/ht/ff">http://orbit-net.nesdis.noaa.gov/arad/ht/ff</a>.
Forecast offices and emergency management officials utilize this data to monitor heavy
rainfall. Accumulation data is available for periods of one hour, three hours, six hours
or 24 hours. </font></p>

<p></u></b><big><big><font color="#000080">Understanding Storms from Space</font></big></big></p>

<p><font color="#000080">From space, severe storms and hurricanes come in a variety of
shapes and sizes, some are wispy, flowing sheets, some are enormous, menacing whirlpools.
But it&#146;s more than what the storm looks like from above that&#146;s important for
predicting how much damage it will do on the ground. Gerald Heymsfield, a Goddard research
meteorologist uses radar aboard a high altitude NASA airplane to measure what storms are
like on the inside in order to let scientists better understand what they see in 2-D
images from GOES. By combining information about wind and circulation within a
thunderstorm with GOES images and cloud temperature measurements, meteorologists can make
more accurate forecasts about the future of a thunderstorm. Information on the radar
experiment can be found at:&nbsp; <a
href="http://rsd.gsfc.nasa.gov/912/code912/precip.html">http://rsd.gsfc.nasa.gov/912/code912/precip.html</a>.
</font></p>

<p><font color="#000080">Just which storms will become severe depends upon the stability
of the atmosphere and the energy available to the growing clouds. GOES provides
temperature and moisture information from the 19 channel sounder onboard. This information
is used in NOAA&#146;s weather prediction models and is also made into images. Static and
animated views of moisture and stability information can be found at two locations: <a
href="http://cimss.ssec.wisc.edu/goes/goes.html">http://cimss.ssec.wisc.edu/goes/goes.html</a>
and <a href="http://orbit-net.nesdis.noaa.gov/goes/">http://orbit-net.nesdis.noaa.gov/goes/</a>.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000080">The amount of wind damage that might occur from thunderstorm
downbursts is the focus of an experimental product by Gary Ellrod, a NOAA scientist. This
product, the Wind Index (WINDEX), available hourly during the thunderstorm season on the
Internet at: <a href="http://orbit-net.nesdis.noaa.gov/arad/fpdt/mb.html">http://orbit-net.nesdis.noaa.gov/arad/fpdt/mb.html</a>
assists forecasters, aircraft operators and transportation officials in decision making.
Downbursts have been responsible for a number of aircraft crashes. </font></p>
<b><u>

<p></u></b><big><big><font color="#000080">GOES: Fire Alarm for the Western Hemisphere</font></big></big></p>

<p><font color="#000080">In 1998, scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) assisted fire fighting efforts in drought stricken Mexico and
Florida. Obscured by dense smoke in Florida and hampered by the rugged terrain and large
area coverage in Mexico, GOES data was used to locate the active fire cores and aid in
fire suppresion activity saving costs, lives and property. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080">In remote areas of the Amazon Rainforest and throughout South
America, thousands of fires burn every day during the dry season &#150; and GOES keeps
tabs. Elaine Prins, a NOAA research meteorologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison
developed a way to use GOES as a fire alarm to tell scientists and government agencies
where, how big, and how hot fires are burning. When GOES sees an area heat up, information
on the fire is sent directly to the Internet every three hours. Scientists working to
model the Earth&#146;s climate are interested in GOES fire data because deforestation and
the amount of smoke sent into the atmosphere by man-made fires in South American forests
may be an important factor affecting the Earth&#146;s climate. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080">In South America, most fires are caused by humans. In North
America, it&#146;s lightning that&#146;s responsible for burning forests. In the Northern
Hemisphere, it is possible to monitor changes in fire characteristics every 15 minutes.
Environment Canada, a Canadian Governmental agency, uses the GOES data to help locate
forest fires in remote areas of Quebec. Information on the GOES Biomass Burning Monitoring
Program is described at: <a href="http://cimss.ssec.wisc.edu/goes/burn/abba.html">http://cimss.ssec.wisc.edu/goes/burn/abba.html</a>
