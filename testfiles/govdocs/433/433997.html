            <P> To understand the complex "plumbing" beneath active volcanic lave 
              lakes and determine the amount of lava flowing from them, Luke Flynn 
              of the University of Hawaii has been using time series of Landsat 
              images. Much of his work has focused on the persistence of volcanic 
              eruptions at Hawaii's Kilauea volcano, which has been continually 
              erupting since 1983. Another objective of Flynn's research - and 
              one critical to many residents of Hawaii - is to map active lava 
              flows and provide advance warning to public safety officials about 
              these natural hazards. 
            <P>Flynn and other volcanologists have been using remote-sensing data 
              from the geostationary <A HREF="http://hotspot.pgd.hawaii.edu/goes/santamaria/latest.shtml">GOES</A> 
              satellite to monitor volcanic eruptions in remote areas in real 
              time. The higher resolution of Landsat data (30 meters as compared 
              to 4 kilometers for GOES) can produce maps of lava flows with pinpoint 
              accuracy, according to Flynn. With these maps researchers can study 
              the evolution of individual eruptions while they are taking place. 
            <P>With Landsat observations of the heat emitted during eruptions, 
              Flynn can distinguish active lava flows from older flows that have 
              already begun to cool. With this data, Flynn's colleague Andrew 
              Harris is generating estimates of the amount of lava erupting onto 
              the surface. Using similar Landsat data, Flynn produces maps of 
              the leading edges of wildfires. 
            <P>Flynn and Harris have also been working with Landsat data of active 
              volcanic lava lakes around the world. In addition to their work 
              in Hawaii, they are studying long-term observations of eruptions 
              in Mexico (Popocatepetl) and Guatemala (Santaguito and Pacaya). 
              Once they have compiled extensive observations of an individual 
              volcano, they create a database of areas on the volcano that are 
              most prone to lava flow hazards. Flynn plans to produce even higher 
              resolution maps of active lava flows (15 m) with Landsat 7. 
            <P>Flynn plans to collect Landsat 7 data at a ground station in Hawaii 
              as the satellite passes over the state. He plans to produce new 
              Landsat 7 volcano (and wildfire) hazard maps for the State of Hawaii 
              every 8 days.
