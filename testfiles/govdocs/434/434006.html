<P><B><FONT SIZE="+2">Laboratory Director announces organizational
changes</FONT></B></P>

<P>Laboratory Director John Browne on Thursday announced several
organizational changes and related actions to strengthen operational
support for continued scientific excellence and engage the Laboratory
more effectively in strategic national security discussions.</P>

<P>Among the organizational actions announced are:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Appointment of Joe Salgado, deputy director for business
  administration and outreach, as Principal Deputy Laboratory Director.
  In this capacity he will function as a Chief Operating Officer
  and will serve as acting director of the Laboratory in Browne's
  absence. Salgado will continue to head the BAO Directorate for
  the time being.
  <LI>Appointment of Steve Younger, associate Laboratory director
  for nuclear weapons, as Senior Associate Laboratory Director
  for National Security to guide and oversee the Laboratory's participation
  in strategic and long-term national security policy and planning.
  Younger will join the Director's Office to assist Browne in formulating
  strategic directions for Los Alamos programs in stockpile stewardship,
  nonproliferation and non-nuclear defense, and will represent
  the Laboratory in high-level interactions with the National Nuclear
  Security Administration, Department of Energy, Department of
  Defense and the military services.
</UL>

<P>Younger also will continue to head the Nuclear Weapons Directorate
pending possible further changes.</P>

<P>&quot;Earlier this year I set before employees my expectation
for the Laboratory in which the quality of our operations matches
the quality of our science and technology,&quot; Browne said.
&quot;Key to this effort is the successful implementation of an
integrated management approach at Los Alamos, and the actions
I am announcing [Thursday] will help us strengthen and integrate
management across the Laboratory.</P>

<P>&quot;Today's announcement describes important and necessary
steps toward the goal of integrated management and a more unified
workforce. The end result will be an environment that better supports
scientific productivity, which is at the core of this Laboratory,&quot;
Browne said Thursday.</P>

<P>&quot;In addition to establishing these two new positions,
I have initiated a 45-day organizational review of the Nuclear
Weapons Directorate,&quot; Browne said. &quot;Recommendations
from the review committee could lead to other changes in our organizational
structure.&quot;</P>

<P>Browne noted that the Nuclear Weapons Directorate represents
more that 70 percent of Los Alamos' budget and impacts nearly
every part of the Laboratory. Successful implementation of integrated
management in this organization is key to its success across the
Laboratory.</P>

<P>The committee, chaired by Hans Ruppel, former associate Laboratory
director for strategic and supporting research, includes representatives
from the University of California's President's Council on the
National Laboratories.</P>

<P>&quot;I have tasked this committee to examine approaches for
dealing with some of the significant management challenges facing
the Lab's stockpile stewardship program while assuring effective
alignment of our organization and activities with the needs and
expectations of the NNSA,&quot; Browne said.</P>

<P>&quot;I want to make clear to employees the importance of this
activity. The committee's recommendations and our subsequent actions
will have a major impact on the management and operation of the
Nuclear Weapons Directorate and consequently on the Lab itself.
In combination with the appointment of the Senior ALD for National
Security, this effort will be a key factor in determining the
strategic direction for the Lab for the next decade,&quot; Browne
said.</P>

<P>The committee is due to report recommendations to Browne by
July 15.</P>

<P>Among the Laboratory's other senior managers, Bill Press, deputy
Laboratory director for science, technology and programs, will
continue to oversee science and technology matters that relate
to the Laboratory's technical direction, overall scientific quality,
Laboratory Directed Research and Development, external reviews,
scientific recruitment and interactions with the academic community.</P>

<P>&quot;Bill and I will continue to work closely on ensuring
that our scientific work is well supported and of the highest
quality. We also will continue to evaluate and support new scientific
directions for the Lab,&quot; Browne said.<BR>
<BR>
Dick Burick, deputy Laboratory director for operations, will continue
to have principal responsibility for facility operations, project
management, safety and security matters. Burick also is the Laboratory's
interface with external regulatory agencies.</P>

<P>Similarly, Associate Laboratory Directors Don Cobb and Tom
Meyer retain their principal responsibilities for threat reduction
and strategic and supporting research, respectively.</P>

<P>Browne also announced another initiative aimed at strengthening
integrated management and operational performance. This is the
creation of a blue-ribbon steering committee to oversee and coordinate
two technical advisory groups for pit production and pit certification.</P>

<P>&quot;Pit production and certification is one of our 10 institutional
goals. It is imperative that we meet the goals and milestones
of these programs on time, within budget and with the highest
quality products and processes. The technical advisory groups
and steering committee will review planning and execution in these
programs to help ensure that we remain on track for success,&quot;
Browne said.</P>

<P>The steering committee is chaired by Retired Adm. Robert Foley,
former commander in chief of the Pacific Fleet and DOE assistant
secretary for defense programs. He currently serves on the boards
of a number of U.S. companies, including Department of Defense
Proxy boards, and is an international business consultant.</P>

<P>Also on the committee are:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>George Emery, a retired vice admiral and former commander
  of the U.S. and NATO Atlantic Submarine Forces. He was president
  of Raytheon Technical Services Co., which provides technical,
  scientific and professional service to defense, federal and other
  customers, and currently serves as a consultant on energy and
  defense issues to a number of organizations.
  <LI>John Weaver, formerly president and chief operating officer
  of Hughes Aircraft Co. and corporate executive vice president
  of Hughes Electronic Corp. A retired rear admiral, Weaver commanded
  the U.S. Navy's Space and Naval Warfare Systems.
  <LI>Richard Garwin, a physicist long employed at the IBM Research
  Center and now Phillip D. Reed Fellow for Science and Technology
  at the Council on Foreign Relations. He has served on the President's
  Science Advisory Committee and the Defense Science Board.
  <LI>Sidney Drell, retired deputy director of the Stanford Linear
  Accelerator Center, who since 1960 has provided technical advice
  to the U.S. government on national security issues, particularly
  nuclear weapons and their stewardship. He currently serves on
  the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, Non-proliferation
  Advisory Panel and the JASONs group of scientific advisors.
</UL>

<P>Other members of the steering committee are Jim Stout, Steve
Guidice and John Birely. Guidice and Birely also will chair the
pit manufacturing and pit certification technical advisory groups,
respectively.</P>

surviving a volcano</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Credits Lab safety training</FONT></B></P>

<P>In January of 1993, a volcano in South America erupted, killing
six of 14 scientists and three tourists trapped inside. Because
of mandatory Laboratory safety precautions, geologist Andy Adams
of Environmental Technology (E-ET) says he was one of the lucky
ones who survived.</P>

<P>In a special &quot;Safety Days&quot; presentation at 10 a.m.
on Tuesday (June 5), Adams will recount the events leading to
the tragedy. The unclassified talk will be held in the Administration
Building Auditorium at Technical Area 3. It is open to L- and
Q-cleared badge holders only.</P>

<P>Outfitted with Lab-required safety equipment, Adams says he
had trouble keeping pace as the exploration team made its way
into the Galeras volcano located at 14,000 feet in the Andes Mountains
of South America. &quot;Here I am, all dressed up with a hard
hat, got a gas mask, safety boots, insulated coveralls and they're
kind of tittering at me,&quot; he said referring to some other
team members.</P>

<P>But he credits his use of that equipment and the stringent
Lab safety requirements with saving his life. &quot;The Laboratory
provided me with the necessary training and equipment to make
surviving a volcanic eruption possible,&quot; Adams said.</P>

<P>&quot;It happened very quickly,&quot; Adams said in a recent
appearance on ABC's &quot;Good Morning America.&quot; There was
&quot;a huge bang, big hot rocks falling out of the sky . . .
and a huge plume of ash and smoke coming out of the volcano,&quot;
he said.</P>

<P>Adams will take the audience on a visual tour of several volcanoes
including an active vent of the Kilauea volcano on the big island
of Hawaii, Vulcon Pacaya located outside of Guatemala City in
Central America, Satsuma Iwo Jima off the southern-most island
of Kyushu, Japan, as well as Vulcon Galares in southern Columbia.</P>

<P>The presentation will be broadcast on LABNET Channel 9. For

<P>Internationally recognized alternative medicine authority Saul
Green will present a Director's Colloquium entitled, &quot;Alternative
Medicine: Fact or Fraud?&quot; at 1:10 p.m. Wednesday (June 6)
in the Physics Building Auditorium at Technical Area 3. The colloquium
is open to the public and will be broadcast on Labnet Channel
9.</P>

<P>Green will address the growing appeal of various alternative
medicine practices, such as chelation therapy, Chinese herbs,
homeopathy, acupuncture, coffee enemas to &quot;detoxify&quot;
the liver, oxygenation therapy and organic diets to &quot;repair&quot;
the normal immune system to recognize and fight cancer.</P>

<P>Often, patients who are undergoing treatment like radiation,
surgery and chemotherapy turn to alternative medicine in their
desperation to escape unpleasant side effects. Green believes
that, too often, entrepreneurs sell patients the false hope that
their treatments can enable the patient to gain personal control
over an innate healing process - while the patient's disease progresses
with deadly, serious consequences.</P>

<P>Green is science editor of the Scientific Review of Alternative
Medicine, as well as a member of the Board of Directors of the
National Council against Health Fraud and the American Council
for Science and Health. Until his retirement in 1981, he was head
of the Department of Biological Response Modifiers at Sloan Kettering
Hospital in New York and Professor of Biochemistry at the Cornell
Graduate School of Medical Sciences.</P>

less money down the drain<BR>
</FONT></B><BR>
The Mobile Pretreatment Unit (MPU), a trailer-mounted wastewater
treatment unit, successfully completed its maiden run, confirming
high expectations from Facilities and Waste Operations (FWO) and
Johnson Controls Northern New Mexico for possible annual savings
of more than $540,000.</P>

<P>&quot;At least 15,000 gallons of wastewater that the Laboratory
currently sends to Technical Area 54 for off-site disposal now
can be treated and disposed of on-site through the [Mobile Pretreatment
Unit],&quot; says Ramiro Marquez, wastewater operator foreman
for JCNNM. &quot;The MPU can process it into routine sanitary
waste or industrial effluent, which means it either meets the
Sanitary Wastewater Treatment Facility (SWS) Waste Acceptance
Criteria (WAC) or the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
System (NPDES) permit criteria for effluents being discharged
to outfalls. &quot;We'll handle the waste for approximately $2
per kilogram.&quot; A recharge fee of $2 per kilogram compares
favorably with the TA-54 recharge rate for New Mexico Special
Waste, which is $5.92 per kilogram, he said.</P>

<P>Prime candidates for the Mobile Pretreatment Unit processing
are liquid New Mexico Special Waste, waste that must be disposed
of in an industrial landfill due to its characteristics, or sanitary
waste that can't be directly discharged to the SWS because the
waste characteristics do not meet the plant's SWS-WAC. A few of
the sources that have traditionally generated candidate wastes
are wastewater from secondary containment vessels, NPDES effluent,
and sump waters that</P>

<UL>
  <LI>require pH adjustment
  <LI>contain high levels of suspended solids and certain dissolved
  solids
  <LI>contain non-aqueous-phase oil or grease
  <LI>contain trace amounts of organics
  <LI>are contaminated with antifreeze or boron
  <LI>consist of cooling tower blowdown that exceeds NPDES standards
</UL>

<P>The new device has the flexibility to treat batches of wastewater
and function as flow-through continuous treatment of industrial
effluent that is near or above NPDES outfall limits. The Mobile
Pretreatment Unit processes wastewater onsite at the generator's
facility or offsite at the TA-46 Sanitary Wastewater Treatment
facility. Environmental Science and Waste Technology (E) Division
wanted to address onsite treatment for liquid wastes that do not
meet the SWS-WAC. The Environmental Stewardship Office (E-ESO)
funded Infrastructure (FWO-UI) to contract for a custom-designed
treatment unit from Clegg Industries of Victoria, Texas.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;ESO worked with FWO-UI and JCNNM-Utilities early on in the
planning phase to determine what capabilities the MPU needed,&quot;
said Patricia Vardaro-Charles, E-ESO project coordinator. &quot;Mobility
to make pretreatment convenient to generators was a main concern.
Further, we had to design a unit that could handle some unique
wastewater concerns,&quot; Vardaro-Charles said.</P>

<P>The technical solution, according to Vardaro-Charles, is a
1,100-gallon process tank, supported by subsystems to perform
flocculation, precipitation, carbon dioxide sparging, pH adjustment,
solids removal by settlement and oil removal. These treatment
processes are the target now, however FWO-UI and JCNNM plan to
expand the device's capabilities in treating more complex wastes
by adding other subsystems, such as an activated carbon unit,
an ion exchange column or a reverse osmosis unit.</P>

<P>Materials that cannot be considered for Mobile Pretreatment
Unit processing are liquids containing Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act components, mixed waste, or radioactive waste above
drinking water standards.</P>

<P>Removal of the motorcycle parking spaces located between the
Otowi Building and the former Business Operations (BUS) Division
Office has been delayed. Motorcyclists can continue to park in
the spaces for the next couple weeks.</P>

<P>The Daily Newsbulletin had reported that the spaces would disappear
this week as demolition work on the Sherwood Building and the
former BUS Division office building gets into gear. However, a
subcontractor involved with the demolition project reported to
Steve McCleary, FMU-81 team leader, that work affecting the motorcycle
parking spaces will be delayed - probably until mid June.</P>

<P>Motorcyclists wishing to have a dress rehearsal in seeking
alternative parking spaces before the Otowi area disappears for
real can seek motorcycle parking in the following nearby areas:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>The motorcycle parking area located directly west of SM-38,
  the Johnson Controls Northern New Mexico shops building;
  <LI>The motorcycle parking area located off of Bikini Atoll Road

volunteer fire department that brought its two water trucks, a
small brush truck and a tanker to Los Alamos during the Cerro
