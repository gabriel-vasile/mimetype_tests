<p><STRONG>Overall Crime and Safety Situation <BR></STRONG><BR>Most foreigners living or traveling in Guatemala are not affected by crime. However, violent crime continues to be a significant problem in Guatemala, and all residents and visitors should take appropriate precautions. Violent criminal activity has been a serious problem in much of Guatemala for years. Over the years, there have been numerous murders, rapes, and armed assaults against foreigners. The national police force is inexperienced and under-funded, and the judicial system is weak, overworked, and inefficient. Criminals, sometimes armed with an impressive array weapons, know that there is little chance they will be caught and punished. <BR><BR>Recently inaugurated president Alvaro Colom has promised his new administration will re-double its predecessor’s efforts to strengthen the police and related public safety entities; however, violent crime continues. The number of violent crimes reported by U.S. citizens and other foreigners has increased in recent years. Incidents include, but are not limited to, assault, theft, armed robbery, home invasion, carjacking, rape, kidnapping, and murder. Criminals generally operate in groups and are confrontational and violent. In spite of regional initiatives to combat them, gangs continue to be a concern in Guatemala City, as well as in rural Guatemala though they have a far greater impact on Guatemalans than on foreigners. Gang members are often well armed. Emboldened armed robbers have attacked vehicles on main roads in broad daylight.&nbsp;<BR><BR>Travel on rural roads increases the risk of a criminal roadblock or ambush. Widespread narcotics and alien smuggling activities can make remote areas especially dangerous. Though there is no evidence that Americans are targeted, criminals look for every opportunity to attack, so all travelers should remain vigilant. Theft, armed robbery, and carjacking are the most common problems encountered by American citizens who visit Guatemala. Violent assaults do occur, though they are not frequent. The upscale hotel and restaurant district of Zone 10 in Guatemala City is not immune to daytime assaults targeting persons carrying bags that look like laptop bags. Violent highway robberies are uncommon, though they do occur. Some recent reports of highway robberies include accusations that police, or assailants dressed like police, have been involved. <BR><BR>Home invasions by armed groups in upscale neighborhoods have occurred, the culprits enticing a resident to open the door, for a delivery or rushing in when family or staff open the door. Guatemala’s homicide rate in 2007 was over 45 per 100,000, with Guatemala City’s homicide rate much higher. Pickpockets and purse-snatchers are prevalent in major cities and tourist sites, especially the central market and other parts of zone 1 in Guatemala City. Those who offer no resistance when confronted by armed thieves are usually not hurt. Armed robberies can and do occur simply to steal a cell phone and they have turned violent. There have been several reported incidents over the past 12 months of bank patrons being robbed outside banks after withdrawing large sums of money, indicating possible complicity of bank personnel on the inside.&nbsp;<BR><BR>Carjacking and vehicle thefts continue to be a serious problem. Bank robberies, kidnappings and gang-related crimes are of great concern and the rates of these crimes remain high. <BR><BR>U.S. citizens may encounter road conditions that different significantly from those in the United States. According to a recent Pan American Health Organization report, Guatemala has the fourth highest traffic fatality rate for all Latin American countries. The information below concerning Guatemala is provided for general reference only, and may not be totally accurate in a particular location or circumstance.&nbsp;<BR><BR>Safety of public transportation: poor&nbsp;<BR>Urban road conditions/maintenance: fair&nbsp;<BR>Rural road conditions/maintenance: good&nbsp;<BR>Availability of roadside/ambulance assistance: fair&nbsp;<BR>Assessment: fair <BR><BR>Driving in Guatemala requires one’s full attention, and safe drivers must drive defensively in order to avoid dangerous situations. Driving at night outside of cities should always be avoided. Because of an almost complete lack of law enforcement, traffic rules are generally ignored. For example, many drivers do not use their turn signals to alert other drivers. Instead a common custom is for a driver or passenger to stick a hand out the window and wave to indicate that they will be taking an unspecified action. Speed limits, lane markings and stop signs are frequently ignored. Winding and/or steep mountain roads, poorly designed surfaces, randomly placed speed bumps, unmarked hazards, and buses that are poorly operated and maintained present additional risks to motorists. <BR><BR>Valid U.S. drivers’ licenses are accepted for the first 30 days of a visit; however, international driving permits are accepted for longer stays. Guatemala’s road safety authorities are the Department of Transit and the Joint Operations Center of the National Police. For Guatemalans, common public transportation is by bus, which serves every town in the country. However, criminal activity and frequent accidents make these recycled U.S. school buses (commonly referred to in many travel guidebooks as “chicken buses”) somewhat dangerous and should be avoided. U.S. Mission employees are discouraged from using these buses. Modern inter-city buses offer some security from highway violence, but armed attacks against them show that all buses are vulnerable. <BR><BR>Most city streets are lit, but secondary and rural roads have little to no illumination. The Inter-American highway and the road from Guatemala City to the Atlantic Ocean can be dangerous due to heavy traffic, including large tractor-trailers. Roadside assistance services are very limited. Police patrol the major roadways and these patrols have been increased due to highway robberies. For roadside assistance travelers may call the police by dialing 120 or the fire department by dialing 122 or 123. Cellular telephone service covers most areas frequented by tourists. Drivers use the right-hand side of the road in Guatemala, and speed limits are posted depending on the condition of the road. Speed limits are different in rural and urban areas. Turning right on red is not permitted unless otherwise posted, and drivers must yield when entering a traffic circle. Seat belts must be worn, but there are no laws regarding the use of child safety seats. It is against the law for drivers to operate cellular phones while driving. <BR><BR>People found driving under the influence of alcohol or other drugs are arrested and may serve jail time. In an accident resulting in injury or death, every driver involved is taken into custody until a judge determines responsibility in a re-enactment of the accident. For additional information about road travel in Guatemala, see the U.S. Embassy homepage at <A href="http://guatemala.usembassy.gov">http://guatemala.usembassy.gov</A>. <BR><BR>For additional general information about road safety, including links to foreign government sites, see the Department of state, Bureau of Consular Affairs home page at <A href="http://travel.state.gov/roadsafety.html">http://travel.state.gov/roadsafety.html</A>.&nbsp;For specific information concerning Guatemalan driving permits, vehicle inspection, road tax, and mandatory insurance, contact the Guatemalan national tourist organization offices via the Internet at <A href="http://www.visitguatemala.net">http://www.visitguatemala.net</A>. <BR><BR>Those contemplating a visit to Guatemala for business or pleasure should read the Consular Information Sheet, or other relevant notices, found at <A href="http://www.state.gov">www.state.gov</A>, before traveling. This site also lists crimes against foreigners that the Embassy has received reports on. <BR><BR><STRONG>Political Violence</STRONG> <BR><BR>Large demonstrations occasionally occur throughout Guatemala, often with little or no notice, and they can cause serious traffic disruptions. Although most demonstrations are peaceful, they can turn violent, and travelers should avoid areas where demonstrations are taking place. The use of roadblocks and/or blocking of public facilities, including the international airport, may prevent tourists caught behind the blockades from leaving. <BR><BR>Protests, greatly impacting traffic, are still the favorite avenue for those who feel disenfranchised and want their voices heard. Bus drivers have blocked roads, protesting for more police presence because of the increase in the number of bus robberies and over dwindling profit margins due to the increase in fuel costs. The ex-civil patrollers (PAC), involved in Guatemala’s civil war that ended in 1996, still occasionally block highways, trapping tourists, including Americans, and isolating small towns. Progress has been made in resolving their grievances, but they are not fully resolved. This group and others are still active and future disruptions are possible.&nbsp;<BR><BR>In the past several years, Guatemalan citizens’ frustration with crime has led to violent incidents of vigilantism, including stoning, lynching, and burning, especially in isolated rural areas. The fear of foreigners stealing children is pervasive among rural indigenous people; visitors need to avoid taking pictures of or paying undue attention to local children. It is wise to avoid any public gathering of agitated citizens; persons attempting to intervene have themselves been attacked by mobs. <BR><BR><STRONG>Post-Specific Concerns</STRONG> <BR><BR>In addition to a serious crime problem throughout the country, Guatemala is a geologically active country. Visitors should be aware of the possibility <BR>of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, and the need for contingency measures. Occasional eruptions have forced evacuations of nearby villages and briefly closed Guatemala City’s international airport, including eruptions by nearby Volcanoes Fuego and Pacaya. Both the Caribbean and Pacific coasts of Guatemala are vulnerable to hurricanes and tropical storms from June through November. Mudslides and flooding during the May to November rainy season often kill dozens of people and close roads. 2005’s Hurricane Stan killed thousands and left many more homeless in Guatemala from flooding and landslides. Stan also severely impacted the country's infrastructure, wiping out villages, roads and bridges throughout the country. General information about natural disaster preparedness is available via the Internet from the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) at <A href="http://www.fema.gov/">http://www.fema.gov/</A>. <BR><BR><STRONG>Police Response</STRONG> <BR><BR>The National Police are lacking in logistical supplies, such as vehicles, fuel, etc., with little improvement since last year. They lack training in many areas, and some have been involved in criminal activities. The current administration is actively pursuing police involved in illegal activities and has taken administrative or legal action against an increasing number of officers. Crime scene control in major investigations is considered to be generally poor, which leads to destruction of evidence and contamination of the scene. There is a severe shortage of trained investigators. Investigators frequently take taxis or buses to conduct their interviews. Police response to calls for help can be spotty. 110 is the local police’s 911 equivalent. The Guatemalan government has made a conscientious effort to improve the number of police, including tourist police in high tourist areas, such as Antigua, Tikal, Chichicastenango and the Lake Atitlan region. If you are detained by the police, please contact the Embassy’s Duty officer via the 24 hour number - 502-2331 2354. <BR><BR><STRONG>Medical Emergencies</STRONG> <BR><BR>A full range of modern medical care is available in Guatemala City, but medical care outside the city is limited. There are some aerial medevac services available in-country. Guatemala’s public hospitals have experienced serious shortages of basic medicines and equipment. Care in private hospitals is generally adequate for most common illnesses and injuries. Serious medical problems requiring hospitalization and/or medical evacuation to the United States can be costly. Doctors and hospitals often expect immediate cash payment for health services, although practically all private hospitals accept major U.S. credit cards. U.S. medical insurance is not always valid outside the United States. U.S. Medicare and Medicaid programs do not provide payment for medical services outside the United States. Uninsured travelers who require medical care overseas may face extreme difficulties. Please check with your own insurance company to confirm whether your policy applies overseas, including provisions for medical evacuation. Please ascertain whether your insurance company will make payments directly to the overseas hospital or doctor or whether you will be reimbursed later for expenses that you incur. Some insurance policies also include coverage for psychiatric treatment and for disposition of remains in the event of death. Useful information on medical emergencies abroad, including overseas insurance programs, is provided in the Department of State’s Bureau of Consular Affairs brochure, “Medical Information for Americans Traveling Abroad,” available via the Bureau of Consular Affairs home page or autofax: (202) 647-3000. information on vaccinations and other health precautions may be obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s hotline for international travelers at 1-877-fyi-trip (1-877-394-8747); fax: 1- 888-cdc-faxx (1-888-232-3299); or via the Internet at <A href="http://www.cdc.gov">www.cdc.gov</A>. A list of English-speaking doctors in Guatemala City is available on the Embassy’s website. <BR><BR><STRONG>Travel Precautions <BR></STRONG><BR>Recommended routes and travel to popular tourist sites: visitors to Antigua have had few problems when using the main route from Guatemala City. Travelers using alternate routes out of Antigua have reported some armed assaults in recent years. The tourist destination of Lake Atitlan is best reached only via the Pan-American Highway (cA-l) (passing through Los Encuentros) and Solola. Winding, hilly secondary roads near the lake have increased risk of violent attacks due to sparseness of traffic and patrols.&nbsp;<BR><BR>Visitors to the Mayan ruins at Tikal are advised to fly to nearby Flores and then travel by bus or tour van to the site. Overland travel in the rest of Peten department, even on main roads, presents safety concerns. Overland travelers should arrive at border posts (only the border posts on main routes are recommended) by early afternoon to ensure enough time to clear formalities and arrive in a major town before dark. <BR><BR><STRONG>How to Avoid Becoming a Victim </STRONG><BR><BR>As a general rule, resisting armed assailants will provoke a violent response. Limit the number of credit cards and other high-value items you bring with you; make copies of the data page in your U.S. passport to facilitate its replacement if lost or stolen; check in with the American Citizen Services section of the Embassy when you arrive and just before you leave; make sure friends or family know your itinerary and check in with them regularly. You may also want to register online through the State Department’s registration system at <A href="https://travelregistration.state.gov/ibrs/home.asp">https://travelregistration.state.gov/ibrs/home.asp</A>.&nbsp;<BR><BR>Note these helpful hints:<BR><BR>-Make sure to lock your doors;&nbsp;<BR>-Leave your windows rolled up;&nbsp;<BR>-Leave at least half a car length of space between you and the car in front of you (this gives you room to maneuver if something happens);&nbsp;<BR>-If you have to pull over on the highway, do it in a well-lit area with high visibility or a public place (preferably within view of a police officer);&nbsp;<BR>-Do not travel after dark outside of Guatemala City.&nbsp;<BR><BR>It is highly recommended to caravan with at least two cars when traveling outside of Guatemala City. Avoid gatherings of agitated people. Confer with trusted local staff or associates, or mass media, before venturing out on trips within the country. <BR><BR>Be conscious of your surroundings and watch for suspicious activity. Carry your money in a front pocket or put it in a zippered or buttoned back pocket. Do not display money, jewelry, a cell phone or other perceived valuables. Never leave a backpack or fanny pack unattended. A common scam is to cause a distraction in a restaurant. Patrons who are distracted and have left valuables on the table or on the back of the chair have had their belongings stolen in this manner, even without leaving their seats. Other scams include enticing a person out of a public place (“can you move your car, please”), then robbing them, or setting up your vehicle to have a flat tire, then offer “assistance” leading to theft or robbery. Use only well-lit ATM located with their host banks or those in better hotels. ATM theft and skimming scams have recently been on the rise. <BR><BR>Never give out your key; do not tell strangers what hotel you are staying in; make sure that you lock your valuables in the hotel safety deposit box; watch for suspicious activity as you enter the hotel and your room; make sure you lock the door and do not open it for unknown people. U.S. citizens can refer to the Department of State’s pamphlet, “A Safe Trip Abroad” for ways to have a safer journey. This publication and others, such as Tips for Travelers to Central and South America, are available from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402; via the Internet at www.access.gpo.gov; or via the Bureau of Consular Affairs home page at <A href="http://travel.state.gov">http://travel.state.gov</A>. <BR><BR>Further Information <BR><BR>Embassy location: U.S. citizens living in or visiting Guatemala are encouraged to register at the consular section of the U.S. Embassy in Guatemala City and obtain updated information on travel and security in Guatemala.
