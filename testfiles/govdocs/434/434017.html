Prologue<BR><BR>My colleagues came and went in the clouds. Banks of cumulus drifted <BR>across the peaks of the Andes, enveloping us in a cool fog that made <BR>it impossible to see anything but the gray rubble on which we stood. <BR>Perched at 14,000 feet on a cone of volcanic debris in southwestern <BR>Colombia, we were checking the vital signs of Galeras -- gases, <BR>gravity, anything that would tell us whether the volcano might erupt.<BR>	As morning gave way to afternoon, the clouds occasionally <BR>dispersed, offering a heartening glimpse of blue sky and revealing <BR>Galeras&quot;s barren, imposing landscape. At the center of the tableau <BR>was the cone, 450 feet high, and its steaming crater. Surrounding the <BR>cone on three sides were high walls of volcanic rock, known as <BR>andesite. Forming an amphitheater 1.3 miles wide and open to the <BR>west, these ramparts were a subtle palette of dun, battleship gray, <BR>and beige. The top of the escarpment was composed of crumbling <BR>columns of hardened lava, the bottom a steep incline of rock and <BR>scree. All of it was the remnant of an earlier volcano that had <BR>collapsed thousands of years ago, spilling its contents down the <BR>mountain in a vast debris field. Occasionally I glimpsed in the west <BR>a forested, razorback ridge sloping toward the equatorial lowlands <BR>9,000 feet below. That was the flank of an ancient volcano, which <BR>imploded 580,000 years ago after a massive eruption.<BR>	For miles around, the landscape was defined by these vestiges <BR>of earlier Galerases in various stages of decay and erosion.<BR>	Around one in the afternoon, I stood with four other <BR>geologists on the crater&quot;s lip and gazed into the steaming pit. Like <BR>the craters of most explosive volcanoes, this was not a cauldron of <BR>lava. It was a moonscape. Some 900 feet wide and 200 feet deep, the <BR>mouth of Galeras was a misshapen hole strewn with jagged boulders. <BR>Much of that rubble came from a hardened magma cap, or dome, that had <BR>been blown to pieces six months earlier in an eruption. At first <BR>glance, the crater seemed a sterile place, its colors running a <BR>dreary spectrum from dark gray to brown to beige. But on closer <BR>inspection the mouth revealed pockets of color -- rust-hued swaths of <BR>rock breaking down in the heat and gases of the crater and canary-<BR>yellow patches of sulfur that had accumulated next to a gas vent, <BR>known as a fumarole. These vents were small fissures where high-<BR>pressure gases were released from the magma body beneath the volcano. <BR>The gases, which assaulted the nostrils with a melange of sharp, <BR>acrid odors right out of the chemistry lab, shot from the fumaroles <BR>with a hiss, obscuring the landscape in a swirl of vapors.<BR>	Galeras&quot;s fumaroles were relatively quiet that day, emitting <BR>a whooshing sound much like that of a steam machine used to clean <BR>buildings. When you step down into such a crater, the howl of the <BR>wind at 14,000 or 16,000 feet is instantly replaced by the eerie <BR>quiet of the earth&quot;s interior. The exception is when volcanoes are <BR>riven by high-pressure, high-temperature fumaroles. Then you feel as <BR>if you are planted behind a jet engine as it prepares for takeoff. <BR>Such fumaroles are not encircled by yellow sulfur crystals, which <BR>form at lower temperatures, but rather by a bathtub ring of expelled <BR>minerals in black, orange, blue, and white.<BR>	I divide volcanoes -- and their craters -- into two types, <BR>hot and cold. Galeras falls into the cold category, which has its own <BR>mix of discomforts. Chief among them are the thin air and the <BR>frequent shifting between overheating and freezing as you sweat <BR>during the ascent, then shiver when the sun disappears behind clouds <BR>and you work at high elevations. With hot, lower-altitude volcanoes, <BR>such as those in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, you sweat all the time, <BR>your clothes stiffening from the salt when they dry. Nearly all <BR>craters are awash with acidic gases so strong they can corrode the <BR>metal eyelets on your boots and leave your skin feeling as if it has <BR>been rubbed raw with Brillo pads.<BR>	That afternoon on Galeras, steam clouds often obscured my <BR>friend Igor Menyailov, a highly regarded Russian volcanologist who <BR>was sitting amid a jumble of rocks thrusting a glass tube into a <BR>fumarole. From deep inside the earth, gases streamed out of the vent <BR>at 440 degrees Fahrenheit and bubbled into solution in Igor&quot;s double-<BR>chambered collection bottle. Taken over time, these samples of sulfur <BR>and chlorine might reveal the volcano&quot;s secrets. Was the magma body <BR>rising? Was an eruption imminent? It was Igor&quot;s first time on <BR>Galeras, his first time in South America, so he could  tell little <BR>about this particular mountain yet. But the fifty-six-year-old <BR>Russian -- a short, handsome man who learned English by listening to <BR>black market recordings of Elvis Presley -- looked content, smiling, <BR>smoking a cigarette, swiveling his head away from the shifting gas <BR>clouds as he talked with the Colombian scientist Nestor Garc&#237;a.<BR>	Circling the rim of the crater, appearing and reappearing in <BR>the fog like a phantom, was the English volcanologist Geoff Brown, <BR>accompanied by the Colombian scientists Fernando Cuenca and Carlos <BR>Trujillo. Brown, a rangy, affable man who also had never set foot on <BR>Galeras till now, was taking the volcano&quot;s pulse with a sophisticated <BR>contraption called a gravimeter. One hundred million times more <BR>sensitive than a grocer&quot;s scale, the gravimeter gauges the forces of <BR>gravity on a mountain as it heaves under the power of rising, molten <BR>rock. Geoff was trying to map the innards of Galeras, hoping, like <BR>Igor, to determine if magma was on the move or if an eruption was <BR>likely. We all used different methods, but our goal was the same -- <BR>to understand what makes a volcano tick, to forecast eruptions, to <BR>save lives. We all wanted to save lives.<BR><BR>I know now what a tricky and elusive thing memory can be, <BR>particularly after a calamity such as Galeras. I sustained a grave <BR>head wound, but was nevertheless able to piece together a picture of <BR>the last minutes before the eruption. Over the years, as I underwent <BR>sixteen operations, as Galeras greeted me every morning when I awoke, <BR>as I slogged through a recovery that continues to this day, I came to <BR>believe unshakably in my version of what had transpired on the crater <BR>rim before Galeras blew. But I am less certain now. Three of my <BR>colleagues, standing just feet from me, remember things differently. <BR>Are they right? Can their stories really be true? Some of my memories <BR>are vivid, others less so. But no matter. This is what I remember of <BR>the moments before Galeras exploded. About the eruption itself -- <BR>well, we&quot;re all more or less in agreement on that.<BR><BR>On January 14, 1993, around 1:40 P.M., I was on the lip of the crater <BR>next to Jos&#233; Arl&#233;s Zapata, a young Colombian volcanologist. Three <BR>tourists, who had hiked up to see what the scientists were doing on <BR>the volcano, stood a few feet away. Near them, moving diagonally down <BR>the volcano&quot;s flank, were two geologists from the United States and <BR>one from Ecuador. I was in charge of this foray onto Galeras and just <BR>minutes before had asked these scientists to begin walking off the <BR>volcano. As a rule, I like to wrap up work on Andean volcanoes by <BR>early afternoon, since the heaviest clouds tend to obscure the peaks <BR>later in the day.<BR>	Igor Menyailov and Nestor Garc&#237;a were in the crater, resting <BR>after taking their final samples. Geoff Brown, Fernando Cuenca, and <BR>Carlos Trujillo were on the crater&quot;s western rim, carrying out their <BR>last gravity readings. Geoff was too far away to hear me, so I just <BR>waved at him, indicating it was time to go.<BR>	A rock tumbled off the inside wall of the crater -- a common <BR>occurrence that at first aroused no concern in me. But a second rock <BR>clattered down the crater mouth, then a third, and soon a cascade of <BR>stones and boulders rained onto the floor of the volcano. It was an <BR>earthquake or an eruption. Either way, we needed to flee.<BR>	&quot;Hurry up! Get out!&quot; I shouted in English and Spanish.<BR>	The volcano began to shake, and I turned to run down the <BR>scree-covered flank. I had made it only a few yards when the air was <BR>rent by a sound like a thunderclap or a sonic boom. Immediately <BR>afterward I heard a deafening craaack, the sound of the earth&quot;s crust <BR>snapping. Instinctively, I hunched my shoulders and hiked my backpack <BR>over my neck and head. I did not get far.<BR><BR>My fascination with volcanoes, now a quarter century old, taps into <BR>something universal and timeless. As they watched fountains of lava <BR>spew from Mount Etna in Italy or Popocat&#233;petl in Mexico, the ancients <BR>believed they were witnessing a phenomenon linked to the origins of <BR>the universe. The flames and magma gushing from a volcano came from a <BR>place as mysterious as the heavens above. Small wonder that the <BR>Mayas, Aztecs, and Incas tossed virgins into the mouth of this beast; <BR>it was capable of destroying villages, towns, entire civilizations in <BR>an instant. Human sacrifice, they believed, would placate the monster.<BR>	To the Greeks, volcanoes were a direct conduit to Hades. The <BR>Romans believed the entrance to hell was in the Phlegraean Fields, <BR>next to Vesuvius, where gases poured out of hundreds of fumaroles.  <BR>Vulcan -- the Roman god of fire -- lived deep inside a mountain on <BR>Vulcano, in the Aeolian Islands. There, at his underground forge, he <BR>rocked the earth and unleashed eruptions as he made weapons for <BR>Apollo, Hercules, and the other gods. The Icelanders, living on an <BR>island that was but a mound of volcanoes, believed hell&quot;s gateway was <BR>the crater of the massive fire mountain Hekla.<BR>	Like any grand and destructive spectacle, volcanoes have <BR>alternately attracted and terrified humanity through the ages. The <BR>difference between ordinary people and volcanologists is that, with <BR>us, the appeal far outweighs the terror. Ours is a counterintuitive <BR>endeavor. Most people flee from erupting volcanoes. We head straight <BR>for them.<BR>	From the moment I first set foot on a volcano -- at Pacaya, <BR>Guatemala, in 1978, where I stared into a crater with dozens of <BR>hissing fumaroles -- I have found it an exhilarating experience. The <BR>spectacle, especially at lava-spewing volcanoes, is impressive. On <BR>later visits to Pacaya, I watched as the volcano -- with a big <BR>KAVOOM! -- repeatedly launched blobs of magma as big as trucks 200 <BR>yards into the air, whereupon the projectiles disintegrated and fell <BR>back to earth in hundreds of glowing, baseball-size pieces. At that <BR>same volcano, a group of students and I witnessed a lava flow, 9 feet <BR>thick and a half mile long, slowly ooze out of Pacaya&quot;s flank. We <BR>tossed banana peels into the flow and watched them turn to ash with a <BR>hiss. Rocks tumbled out of the black stream, revealing the <BR>incandescent, orange-yellow core of the lava tongue. We clocked the <BR>flow&quot;s speed, about 15 feet per hour, and took its temperature, 1,970 <BR>degrees F. You could only insert the temperature probe when the wind <BR>was blowing away from your body; otherwise you started to cook.<BR>	Lava is pretty to look at but rarely dangerous. Eruptions are <BR>driven by the explosive power of pent-up gases. (Think of the cork <BR>blasting off a bottle of champagne.) But the lava that pours out of <BR>Kilauea and other picturesque Hawaiian volcanoes tends to be <BR>relatively fluid and depleted of its gases, hence not explosive. The <BR>volcanoes with thick, pasty magma -- from which gases cannot readily <BR>escape -- pose the greatest danger of eruption. On these mountains <BR>there often isn&quot;t a river of lava in sight.<BR>	The subtler, extraterrestrial beauty of these explosive <BR>volcanoes is, to me, no less stirring. Gases roar out of fumaroles. <BR>Hunks of basalt the size of small cars litter the landscape, vestiges <BR>of earlier eruptions. I always sense that, despite the barren <BR>surroundings, I am perched on a conduit to the most basic energy of <BR>the universe, a pipeline to the beginnings of the planet. No other <BR>place leaves me as keenly aware of man&quot;s powerlessness in the face of <BR>nature and the inconsequence of a single life.<BR>	I also take pleasure being in a place where, with good <BR>reason, few people ever set foot. The splendid loneliness of our work <BR>was brought home to me recently when I looked at a series of <BR>photographs of a colleague, David Johnston of the U.S. Geological <BR>Survey, sampling gases on the summit of Mount St. Helens on May 17, <BR>1980, the day before it erupted. The volcano&quot;s northern flank was <BR>bulging out as much as 12 feet a day from the increasing pressure of <BR>rising magma. The governor had ordered the evacuation of nearly <BR>everyone within 8 miles of the volcano. Yet Johnston and another <BR>young volcanologist, Harry Glicken, rode a helicopter to the top of <BR>the volcano, landed on its swelling hide, and took gas samples.<BR>	The first picture, an aerial, shows the gray northern face of <BR>Mount St. Helens, with an arrow pointing to the area where Johnston <BR>was working. The second and third photographs, taken by Glicken with <BR>a telephoto lens, show a speck of a man, dressed in blue jeans, <BR>bending over a fumarole. That was Johnston. I can imagine the fear <BR>and excitement that stirred inside him as he hurried to collect his <BR>samples and get off the volcano, whose ever-distending flank promised <BR>that it would soon blow. He was alone on top of the mountain, riding <BR>the back of a monster.<BR>	By the next morning Johnston was dead. Studying the volcano <BR>from an observation post 5.7 miles from the summit, he was <BR>incinerated and buried in a blast as powerful as five hundred of the <BR>atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima. Glicken was not killed at Mount <BR>St. Helens. He died eleven years later in an eruption in Japan.<BR>	My colleagues and I don&quot;t harbor a death wish. But despite <BR>the progress we&quot;ve made in taking a mountain&quot;s measure using <BR>seismometers and other remote sensing devices, the best way to <BR>understand a volcano is still, in my opinion, to climb it. I study <BR>volcanic gases, which indicate how much magma is rising inside a <BR>volcano and how explosive it is likely to be. The most accurate way <BR>to sample gases is to descend into a volcano&quot;s crater and insert <BR>pipes into the fumaroles expelling steam, carbon dioxide, sulfur <BR>dioxide, and other compounds. This is dangerous work, as I know from <BR>personal experience and the loss of a dozen friends and colleagues. <BR>But the goal, which has driven me throughout my career and has taken <BR>me to more than a hundred volcanoes in two dozen countries, is a <BR>worthy one: to improve our ability to forecast eruptions.<BR>	All the volcanologists I admire, whether they&quot;ve died in <BR>eruptions or lived to old age, share a passion for working on <BR>volcanoes. Most geologists are like pathologists, scrutinizing dead <BR>systems for clues of cataclysm and violent demise. Volcanologists are <BR>emergency room doctors. We work in the here-and-now, plunging into <BR>crises as the earth&quot;s fifteen hundred active volcanoes take turns <BR>popping off. We clamber on volcanoes because it is the best way to <BR>understand their behavior. But we&quot;re also hooked on the thrill of <BR>climbing into the crater, of confronting so monumental a force. No <BR>place on earth leaves me feeling as alive as a volcano does.<BR><BR>In the quarter century since I began studying geology, our knowledge <BR>of volcanoes has grown dramatically, testimony to how young the <BR>discipline is. Only in the last few decades has the cornerstone <BR>theory of plate tectonics become fully understood and accepted. I <BR>have witnessed and played a small role in these recent advances in <BR>our knowledge, yet a quarter century of work has not diminished my <BR>awe of the power of volcanoes and their role in creating our planet. <BR>Our atmosphere and our oceans appeared roughly 4.4 billion years ago, <BR>when the new planet -- an accretion of star dust -- began to vent <BR>gases and water through primitive volcanoes in the form of steam. <BR>Over the past 2.5 billion years, the earth&quot;s plates have collided, <BR>separated, collided again, and thrust under one another to create our <BR>landscape. Drive down the spine of the Appalachians and you are <BR>cruising over the remains of ancient volcanoes that ceased spitting <BR>magma more than 200 million years ago. Visit Yellowstone Park and you <BR>are in the midst of three gigantic calderas, circular depressions <BR>formed when a volcano ejects its contents and then collapses in on <BR>itself. The three eruptions in the Yellowstone Basin, which occurred <BR>from 2 million to 600,000 years ago, blasted out several thousand <BR>times more pumice, rock, and ash than the 1980 eruption at Mount St. <BR>Helens. One Yellowstone eruption alone created a caldera about 30 <BR>miles long and 50 miles wide.<BR>	West of Yellowstone, in eastern Oregon and Washington, sit <BR>the vast basalt canyonlands of the Columbia River. In this basin, <BR>about 16 million years ago, fissures in the crust opened up and, over <BR>the course of 1 million to 2 million years, oceans of magma poured <BR>out onto the surface from a source hundreds of miles inside the <BR>earth. Piling up in pancake-like layers, the basalt reached a depth <BR>of nearly 10,000 feet in some places. The accompanying ash and gas <BR>would have blocked some of the sun&quot;s rays, drastically lowering <BR>temperatures worldwide. But the Columbia River &quot;flood basalts&quot; were <BR>dwarfed by two earlier basalt outpourings in India and Siberia. Those <BR>events, one occurring 248 million years ago and the other 65 million <BR>years ago, radically altered the earth&quot;s climate and may have played <BR>a role -- possibly along with meteorite impacts -- in the mass <BR>extinctions of dinosaurs and other animals.<BR>	Such calamities are almost beyond comprehension. Easier to <BR>grasp are the great eruptions of recent times, minuscule by <BR>comparison but still awesome in their destructive power. In the past <BR>225 years alone, volcanic eruptions have killed at least 220,000 <BR>people. Only a handful died in lava flows; the rest perished in ways <BR>that do not readily come to mind. In 1783, in Iceland, the earth was <BR>split by a 17-mile volcanic fissure, which gushed ash, lava, and <BR>gases for several months. Nobody died in the actual eruption, but the <BR>poisonous fluorine gas that rushed out of the vents blanketed the <BR>countryside and killed half of the nation&quot;s cattle and three quarters <BR>of its sheep. In the ensuing famine 9,300 people died, one fifth of <BR>Iceland&quot;s population.<BR>	In 1815, in what was probably the largest eruption of the <BR>last 10,000 years, Tambora exploded on the island of Sumbawa in <BR>Indonesia. About 12,000 people died immediately, either incinerated <BR>by speeding clouds of gas and ash, known as pyroclastic flows, or <BR>drowning in huge volcano-induced waves, known as tsunamis. Later, at <BR>least 44,000 people -- some say as many as 100,000 -- perished of <BR>famine and disease on neighboring islands when thick layers of ash <BR>ruined crops and killed livestock. Volcanic aerosols and dust in the <BR>stratosphere made temperatures drop around the world, causing &quot;the <BR>Year Without a Summer&quot; in New England and creating the vivid red <BR>sunsets painted by the English artist J.M.W. Turner.<BR>	In 1883, also in Indonesia, Krakatau erupted, its blast heard <BR>as far as Rodrigues Island in the Indian Ocean, 2,900 miles away. An <BR>estimated 36,000 people died, most of them in towering tsunamis that <BR>swept the island of Sumatra.<BR>	Nineteen years later, in 1902, Mont Pel&#233;e erupted on the <BR>island of Martinique, unleashing a pyroclastic flow that sped down <BR>the mountain at 100 miles an hour and, in minutes, killed 27,000 <BR>people in the city of St. Pierre.<BR>	In 1985 a small eruption at Nevado del Ruiz in Colombia <BR>melted glaciers at the volcano&quot;s summit and created a mudflow that <BR>swept through the town of Armero, killing 23,000 people in several <BR>hours. Two days later I was on the scene, measuring the gases <BR>streaming out of Ruiz and flying over the entombed town. Scientists <BR>from both Colombia and the United States had warned of such a <BR>disaster but were ignored by local civil defense officials.<BR>	I left Armero keenly aware that if we don&quot;t improve our <BR>ability to forecast eruptions and educate local officials, another <BR>eruption will kill tens of thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands, <BR>of people someday. Burgeoning populations, particularly in Third <BR>World countries, have pushed many people even closer to active <BR>volcanoes. Today, roughly 500 million people live within reach of an <BR>eruption. The famed eruption of Vesuvius in A.D. 79 killed several <BR>thousand people at Pompeii and Herculaneum. Dr. Peter Baxter, a good <BR>friend and the world&quot;s leading expert on how volcanoes kill, says <BR>that if a similar eruption occurred without warning today, and if the <BR>evacuation of Naples and its suburbs moved slowly, more than 100,000 <BR>people might perish in a few minutes.<BR><BR>Six years after the eruption at Galeras I stood again at the crater&quot;s <BR>rim, scarcely recognizing the blasted, gray pit spread out before me. <BR>The ledge on which Igor Menyailov and Nestor Garc&#237;a knelt and sampled <BR>gases had disappeared. The western rim, where Geoff Brown, Fernando <BR>Cuenca, and Carlos Trujillo stood, had been partially blown away by <BR>the eruption. Portions of the crater&quot;s southwestern lip had <BR>collapsed. Even the outer flank of the crater, where I had run for my <BR>life, had changed, its lower reaches littered with boulders -- some <BR>as big as washing machines -- thrown from the volcano. The truth is <BR>that few places on earth are as mutable as a volcano&quot;s peak, where <BR>high-pressure gases force open new fumaroles and eruptions scour the <BR>crater&quot;s bottom and sides.<BR>	Gazing into the crater, I was struck by how tiny, in a <BR>geological sense, the eruption had been. As the steam from fumaroles <BR>drifted past me and wafted down Galeras&quot;s western flank, I reminded <BR>myself that the deadly eruption was a mere hiccup, a blast so small <BR>that geologists decades hence will find no sign of it. Yet the power <BR>of the eruption, to those of us who lived through it, was staggering. <BR>It wiped five of my colleagues from the face of the earth. It killed <BR>nine men, injured six others, and continues to ripple through the <BR>lives of dozens of people. It nearly killed me.<BR>	The volcano runs like a fault line through my days, dividing <BR>my existence into life before Galeras and life after.<BR><BR><BR>Copyright &#169; 2001 by Stanley Williams and Fen Montaigne<hr><br><br>Library of Congress subject headings for this publication: Williams, Stanley, 1952-Galeras Volcano (Colombia) Eruption, 1993, Volcanologists United States Biography
