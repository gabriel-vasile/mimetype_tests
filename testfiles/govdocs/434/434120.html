        <h1>Shakespeare's <i>Othello</i> and the Power of Language</h1>
        <BLOCKQUOTE><I>I am not 
what I am</I><BR> -Iago to Rodrigo (<A HREF="http://the-tech.mit.edu/Shakespeare/othello/othello.1.1.html">Othello 
1.1.65)</A></BLOCKQUOTE><H3>Introduction</H3><p><SPAN CLASS="content">Despite 
the truth of Iago's confession to Rodrigo that he is not what he appears to be, 
his gullible sidekick continues to trust this two-faced "confidante" who swears 
<I>"by Janus,"</I> and who sows doubt, destruction and despair in the paths of 
all he encounters. How? How is Iago able to convince one and all that he is, as 
he is constantly called, <I>"honest Iago"</I>? </span></p><p><SPAN CLASS="content">Much 
of the answer must lie in Iago's skillful manipulation of rhetorical skills. A 
puppeteer of the psyche, Iago pulls the strings of those who should know better 
with a battery of verbal weapons. In his soliloquies and dialogues he reveals 
himself to the audience to be a master of connotative and metaphoric language, 
inflammatory imagery, emotional appeals, well-placed silences, dubious hesitations, 
leading questions, meaningful repetition, and sly hints. Indeed, Iago is so good 
at lying that he is able to convince even himself that he has the soundest of 
reasons to destroy Othello, Desdemona, and Cassio. </span></p><p><SPAN CLASS="content">Iago's 
convincing rhetoric clearly reveals what a powerful-and dangerous-tool language 
can be, especially when used by the eloquent, but unscrupulous, individual. In 
this lesson, students explore the basis of Iago's persuasive power by analyzing 
his astonishing command of rhetoric and figurative language. The diverse set of 
activities below include short group performances, writing exercises, and the 
guided use of online dictionaries and concordances to study Shakespeare's language. 
</span></p><h3>Guiding Question:</h3><p><SPAN CLASS="content">How does Iago use 
language to deceive others? How does Iago convince Othello that Cassio is a drunk, 
disloyal soldier, or that Desdemona is a cunning whore? Why does Iago use his 
rhetoric and acting skills to destroy others? What drives him? Who and what is 
Iago?</span></p><H3>Learning Objectives</H3><p><SPAN CLASS="content"><ul><li>Read 
closely and analyze Iago's rhetoric in specific monologues and dialogues with 
other characters </li><li>Study what Iago says (his word choice) and how he says 
it (his superb acting), as well as what he refrains from saying (the silence that 
spurs his listeners on to imagining the worst or to realizing the worst about 
themselves). </li><li>Learn some basic rhetorical terms </li><li>Discover the 
sometimes dangerous power of language</li></ul></SPAN> <H3>Preparing to Teach 
this Lesson</H3><p><ul><li>Shakespeare's works online: Standard online editions 
of most of Shakespeare's works, including Othello, are available from the <A HREF=" http://the-tech.mit.edu/Shakespeare/"> 
MIT Shakespeare Homepage</a>, a link on the EDSITEment-reviewed <A HREF="http://shakespeare.palomar.edu/">Mr. 
Shakespeare and the Internet</a>. (All links in this lesson to the text of the 
play are to the MIT edition.) <UL><LI>Iago's mastery of rhetoric: So they can 
more fully appreciate Iago's rhetorical skill, students should be introduced to 
(or reminded about) rhetoric and rhetorical devices before jumping immediately 
into the play. The EDSITEment-reviewed <A HREF="http://humanities.byu.edu/rhetoric/silva.htm">Silva 
Rhetoricae: The Forest of Rhetoric</a> offers useful definitions and examples 
of all the following terms:<br><br> appeals to reason, emotions, and character (logos, 
pathos, ethos) <br> metaphor <br> intimation<br> repetition (of specific words 
and ideas) <br> Other terms, not mentioned on this website but also useful for 
the study of <I>Othello</I>, include <I>image, connotative language</I>, and <I>leading 
questions</I>. <br><br> By giving their attention to Iago's rhetorical skills, 
students will see how he uses language to create a convincing, albeit deceptive, 
identity for himself; Iago also creates equally untrue identities for others, 
resulting in a fateful-if not fatal-outcome for all concerned. One strategy for helping 
students to focus on the details of Iago's language would be to provide them with 
a handout of the key rhetorical terms to be used throughout the reading of Othello. 
Or, if the technology is available at your school, you could display <A HREF="http://humanities.byu.edu/rhetoric/silva.htm">Silva 
Rhetoricae: The Forest of Rhetoric</a> via computer and LCD projector to the class 
(with the webpage displayed, just click on the words that the students will need 
to know). </LI></UL></li><li>Othello as a stranger in a strange land: In order 
to understand how and why Iago's rhetoric might work so effectively against Othello, 
students should also be made aware of the powerful general's vulnerability: he 
is a Moor in an alien society, first in the city of Venice and then on the isle 
of Cyprus. In short, Othello is an "other," and the fact that he is a Moor surrounded 
by Italians and Cypriots only emphasizes his difference. </li></ul><P>But what 
is a Moor and what did it mean to be a Moor in Shakespeare's time? In helping 
the students answer these questions, the teacher could refer to three websites: 
</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>1. A remarkable resource maintained by the University of Toronto, 
the <A HREF="http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/english/emed/emedd.html">Early Modern 
English Dictionary Database</a> (EMEDD) makes accessible the contents of dictionaries, 
glossaries, grammars, and encyclopedias published in England from 1500 to 1660. 
EMEDD is a link on the EDSITEment-reviewed <A HREF="http://shakespeare.palomar.edu/">Mr.Shakespeare 
and the Internet</a>. </P><P>2. <A HREF="http://www.ipl.org/">Internet 
Public Library</a>, an EDSITEment reviewed site, offers a host of modern dictionaries 
for reference. </P><P>3. <A HREF="http://www.folger.edu/education/teaching.htm">Teaching 
Shakespeare</a>, an EDSITEment reviewed site produced by the Folger Shakespeare 
Library, offers an extensive archive of lesson plans on Othello. </P><P>On the 
<A HREF="http://www.folger.edu/education/teaching.htm">Teaching Shakespeare</a> site, see especially a 
lesson plan entitled "<A HREF="http://www.folger.edu/education/lesson.cfm?lessonid=61">Othello's 
Predecessors: Moors in Renaissance Popular Literature</a>"; rather than defining 
"Moor" in a simple or straightforward manner, this lesson offers teachers and 
students an opportunity to consider the Renaissance view of Moors as found in 
dramas by Shakespeare's contemporaries, George Peele (<I>The Battle of Alcazar</I>) 
and Thomas Dekker (<I>Lust's Dominion, or the Lascivious Queen</I>). The Folger 
lesson plan also offers a historical view of Moors by Leo Africanus in his <I>The 
History and Description of Africa</I>. </P><P>For other definitions of "Moor" 
contemporary with Shakespeare, one's best bet is to go first to the <A HREF="http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/english/emed/emedd.html">EMEDD</a>, 
where one discovers a whole host of definitions from 1550-1598. Among these definitions 
is the following: "a blacke Moore, or man of Ethiope…a Moore or blackeman, and 
it signifieth also the mulberie tree." A useful follow up to the EMEDD comes from 
the <A HREF="http://www.ipl.org/">Internet Public Library</a>'s <A HREF="http://www.bartleby.com/61/">American Heritage 
Dictionary</a>, which offers the narrower modern definition of "Moor" as "1. a 
member of a Muslim people of mixed Berber and Arab descent, now living chiefly 
in northwest Africa. 2. One of the Muslims who invaded Spain in the 8th century and 
established a civilization in Andalusia that lasted until the late 15th century." 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE><ul><LI>Lastly, students should be introduced to the Roman god 
Janus. It is the image of Janus that Shakespeare clearly associates with Iago 
to emphasize and cast a negative slant on Iago's "two-faced" speech. <A HREF="http://www.bulfinch.org/">Bulfinch's 
Mythology</a>, a link on the <a href="http://www.ipl.org/">Internet Public Library</a>, contains both an explication 
and illustration of Janus (go to the page on <A HREF="http://www.bulfinch.org/fables/bull1a.html">Roman 
Divinities</a> and find the entry for Janus). The visual aid should help students 
better understand Iago as a man who speaks from two sides of his face; or as a 
student once commented, with a "forked tongue." Further <A HREF="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/vor?lookup=Janus&collection=">materials 
related to Janus</a>, including images, can be located on the EDSITEment-reviewed 
resource, <A HREF="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/">Perseus Project</a>.</LI></ul><P><A NAME="ACTIVITIES"><h3>Suggested 
Activities</h3></a> <P><span class="contentbold">1. Act I, scene 1, lines 86-91, 
108-112 In-Class acting and discussion of Othello </span></P><ul><li>Before introducing 
this activity, download and copy the worksheet, <A HREF="/lesson_images/lesson400/ZoundsSir.pdf"> 
"Zounds, sir, you're robbed,"</a> available here as a pdf file. This worksheet 
will be used by student groups to complete an analysis of Iago's language in the 
first scene of the play. </li><li>For the two cited passages from <A HREF="http://the-tech.mit.edu/Shakespeare/othello/othello.1.1.html">Act 
1, scene 1</a>, students will analyze Iago's description of Desdemona's flight 
with Othello to her unknowing father, Brabantio. Have 3 students enact and read 
aloud the roles of Roderigo, Iago, and Brabantio. Divide the rest of the class 
into 2 groups. As the scene is acted and read aloud, group 1 should make a list 
of the metaphors and images that Iago associates with Othello and Desdemona. This 
group should also characterize these images. Group 2 should determine what rhetorical 
appeals are used here and why. </li><li>When the actors have completed their readings, 
have group 1 use the worksheet 1, <A HREF="/lesson_images/lesson400/ZoundsSir.pdf"> 
"Zounds, sir, you're robbed,"</a> to list the metaphors that Iago uses to describe 
Othello and Desdemona. As a class, discuss the images and ask, "what makes them 
so offensive-especially to the father of the daughter being described?" Why doesn't 
Iago just say, "Desdemona has married the noble general, Othello"? Furthermore, 
how does Iago characterize Desdemona's and Othello's relationship? Through his 
eyes, is their relationship one of love or lust? And how would this point of view 
affect Brabantio, a proud father of a much-cherished daughter? Group 2 should 
then state what rhetorical appeals Iago makes to Brabantio. Does Iago use appeals 
of pathos, ethos, or logos? Which lines show these appeals? The entire class should 
discuss what psychological effects Iago's words have on Brabantio. </li><li>Conclude 
the class by asking the students how they view Iago, Desdemona, Othello, and Brabantio 
as based on what they have read and discussed.</li></ul><P><span class="contentbold"> 
2. Four key passages: 1.1.41-65; I.i.8-33; I.3.368-386; 2.1.268-294 "Knavery's 
plain face is never seen till used." </span></P><P><SPAN CLASS="content">Either 
as an in-class exercise or as homework, you can ask students to examine Iago's 
speech to Roderigo (<A HREF="http://the-tech.mit.edu/Shakespeare/othello/othello.1.1.html">1.1. 
41-65</a>) for what he says about himself and how he describes himself. Students 
should translate and rewrite what Iago says into modern English. </span></P><P><SPAN CLASS="content">Also, 
ask students to examine and write down Iago's reasons for wishing to appear false 
to Othello (see especially <A HREF="http://the-tech.mit.edu/Shakespeare/othello/othello.1.1.html">1.1.8-33</a>; 
<A HREF="http://the-tech.mit.edu/Shakespeare/othello/othello.1.3.html">I.3.368-386</a>; 
and <A HREF="http://the-tech.mit.edu/Shakespeare/othello/othello.2.1.html">2.1.268-294</a>). 
What are the reasons? Is there any evidence for these reasons? If not, how does 
Iago use words to convince himself that he is completely justified in destroying 
Othello? That is, does Iago use any rhetorical devices to convince himself that 
he is in the right? </span></P><P><SPAN CLASS="content">Students' written work 
can form the basis for the next class discussion. </span></P><P><span class="contentbold">3. 
Act 1, scene 3, lines 381-82 "The Moor is of a free and open nature, / That thinks 
men honest that but seem to be so." </span></P><P><SPAN CLASS="content"><ul><li>This 
activity involves research and written class work for 4 groups of students. Before 
dividing students into groups, initiate a class discussion with the following 
observation and question: The characters in the play refer to Iago as "honest." 
What do we mean today when we say someone is honest? </li><li>After a discussion 
of what "honest" means in today's society, divide the students up into four groups. 
Each group must answer in writing the following question: What did it mean to 
be "honest" in Shakespeare's time? The groups will consult the <A HREF="http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/english/emed/emedd.html">Early 
Modern English Dictionary Database</a> to find the meaning(s) of "honest." (Hint: 
the word may have a different meaning for a man and for a woman.) </li><li>Each 
group should also be assigned to trace one character's "honesty" throughout the 
play. For example, one group should have Iago, another Othello, another Cassio, 
and still another Desdemona. They should then use the <A HREF="http://www.theplays.org/othello/">The Plays of William Shakespeare</a>, a link on <A HREF="http://shakespeare.palomar.edu/">Mr. 
Shakespeare and the Internet</a>, to see how many times the word "honest" appears, 
and how many times it appears in regard to their character's name. The students 
in each group should take careful notes of their findings not only because they 
will be expected to share their findings with the rest of the class, but also 
because at the play's end they may write a short essay on the honesty of their 
group's character (see <A HREF="http://edsitement.neh.gov/view_lesson_plan.asp?id=400#7">Suggested 
Activity 7</a>, below).</li></ul></span> <P><span class="contentbold">4. Act III,

"Two-faced" Speech</I>. This speech requires that three students and the rest 
of the class to work together. One will play "Iago 1" (the persuasive Iago), in 
an imagined scene wherein he tries to convince his wife, Emilia, to give him Desdemona's 
handkerchief. The other student will play "Iago 2" (the truth-teller). The third 
student will play Emilia, and the rest of the class will play the discerning audience. 
<UL><LI>Iago 1 will address Emilia and ply her with as many persuasive appeals 
he can think of to convince her to hand over the handkerchief. </LI><LI>After 
Iago 1 finishes brief parts of his plea, Iago 2 will, after Iago 1 speaks, tell 
the class exactly what he is trying to do as his "good face" speaks. In other 
words, Iago 2, the truth-teller, reveals what really lies behind Iago 1's blandishments. 
After the speech, first Emilia and then the class will have to decide whether 
Iago should get the handkerchief or not. Both Emilia and the class will have to 
state their reasons for handing over the handkerchief or not. </LI></UL></LI><LI><I>The 
Desdemona Defense Speech</I>. In this speech the students will each pretend to 
be Desdemona. In the play, she did not effectively deter Othello from altering 
his misguided opinion that she is a whore; inevitably, her failure frustrates 
many students who say, "If she just spoke up for herself things will be different!". 
In the students' speeches, they need to come up with the words, arguments, and 
appeals that could convince a jealous man that his wife is innocent. These speeches 
may also be performed for the class. </LI></UL></li><li>Capstone Assignment #2: 
Two Paper Topic Ideas <UL><LI><I>The power of language</I>. As seen throughout 
the play, Iago persuades people to do his will. In your essay, write a thesis 
that states exactly what it is Iago achieves—or tries to achieve—through 
his use of persuasive language. Then use specific examples from the text to show 
how Iago achieves or fails to achieve those goals. </LI><LI><I>Honesty</I>. Earlier 
in our study of the play, we discussed the various meanings of "honest" and saw 
how that word applied to Iago, Othello, Cassio, and Desdemona. In an essay, discuss 
why honesty-or the reputation for being honest or the lack of honesty-is so important 
in Shakespeare's <I>Othello</I>.</LI></UL></li></ul><h3>Extending the Lesson</h3><ul><li>For 
further evidence of Iago's successful persuasive techniques, one might also profitably 
examine Iago's interactions with Roderigo (see <A HREF="http://the-tech.mit.edu/Shakespeare/othello/othello.1.3.html">1.3. 
297-364</a>) and with Michael Cassio (see <A HREF="http://the-tech.mit.edu/Shakespeare/othello/othello.2.3.html">2.3.239-302</a>). 
(The irony of Iago's stand on reputation, in his speech to Cassio, is that it 
is the exact opposite of what he does throughout the play; here as elsewhere, 
he relies firmly on his reputation as being an "honest" man). </li><li>Further 
study of Iago as being an uncharacteristically compelling villain would be interesting 
to pursue. See Gilchrist, K. J. <A HREF="http://www.marshall.edu/engsr/SR1997.html"><i>Approximations: 
Iago as a Plautine leno</I></a> (from <I>West Virginia Shakespeare and Renaissance 
Association Selected Papers (SRASP)</I>, Volume 20, 1997), a link on <A HREF="http://shakespeare.palomar.edu/">Mr. 
Shakespeare and the Internet</a>. In this essay, Gilchrist argues that Iago's 
literary heritage may be traced back to Plautus' <I>leno</I> or pimp figure, as 
well as to Plautus' <I>agelast</I>, a non-laugher or kill-joy, someone who cannot 
enjoy life or the fact that others might be happy and successful. The article 
induces useful speculation about how Iago's greedy obsession with sex, money, 
and jealousy might explain his ill will towards Cassio, Othello, and Desdemona. 
The article is useful primarily for teachers who might wish to ask their students 
why Iago behaves as he does. Is he simply evil? Are there explanations for his 
behavior? Do explanations even matter?</li></ul>
