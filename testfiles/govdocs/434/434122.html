MODULE II: Attitudes and Beliefs--Their
Influence</FONT></H1>


<B>Gusfield, J. <I>Prevention File, Alcohol, Tobacco and Other
Drugs</I> University of California at San Diego Extension. Alcohol
and Other Drug Studies. 8:11<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">B</FONT>13,

</B>The report states that there is much to learn about alcohol
problems in our society by examining the way we look at them.
Are we viewing a problem in terms of morality? health? safety?
justice? The answer may determine what policies are pursued to
reduce alcohol problems. The report concludes that the line between
use and abuse of alcohol may be drawn by the implications of what
one does under the influence of alcohol, not the amount one drinks.
