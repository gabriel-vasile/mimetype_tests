General Revision of Regulations Relating to Withholding of Tax on
Certain U.S. Source Income Paid to Foreign Persons and Related
Collection, Refunds, and Credits; Revision of Information
Reporting and Backup Withholding Regulations; and Removal of
Regulations Under Part 35a and of Certain Regulations Under
Income Tax Treaties

AGENCY:  Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Treasury.

ACTION:  Notice of proposed rulemaking and withdrawal of notice
of proposed rulemaking.

SUMMARY:  This document contains proposed regulations relating to
the withholding of income tax under sections 1441 and 1442 on
certain U.S. source income paid to foreign persons, the related
tax deposit and reporting requirements under section 1461, and
the related collection, refunds, and credits of withheld tax
under sections 1461 through 1463 and section 6402.  Additionally,
this document contains proposed regulations relating to the
statutory exemption under sections 871(h) and 881(c) for
portfolio interest.  This document proposes to remove certain
temporary employment tax regulations under the Interest and
Dividend Compliance Act of 1983 and to amend existing regulations
under sections 6041A and 6050N.  This document also proposes
changes to proposed regulations contained in project number INTL-
52-86, published on February 29, 1988 (53 FR 5991) under sections
6041, 6042, 6045, and 6049.  This document proposes related
changes to the regulations under sections 163(f), 165(j), 3401,
3406, 6114, and 6413 and proposes further changes to the proposed
regulations under section 6109 contained in project number IL-
0024-94 published on June 8, 1995 (60 FR 30211).  This document
proposes to remove certain regulations under income tax treaties. 
The IRS and Treasury have reviewed current withholding and
reporting procedures applicable to cross-border flows of income
and have concluded that changes are necessary in view of the
substantial growth in such flows over the past 15 years. This
document also removes proposed regulations published on July 12,
1976 (41 FR 28517) and September 10, 1984 (49 FR 355110),
respectively.
DATES:  Written comments and requests for a public hearing must
be received by July 22, 1996.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Paperwork Reduction Act
     The collections of information contained in this notice of
proposed rulemaking have been submitted to the Office of
Management and Budget for review in accordance with the Paperwork
Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3507).  
     Comments on the collection of information should be sent to
the Office of Management and Budget, Attn:  Desk Officer for the
Department of the Treasury, Office of Information and Regulatory
Affairs, Washington, DC 20503, with copies to the Internal
Revenue Service, Attn: IRS Reports Clearance Officer, T:FP, 
Washington, DC 20224.  Comments on the collections of information
should be received by June 21, 1996.
     An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not
required to respond to, a collection of information unless the
collection of information displays a valid control number.
     The collections of information relating to foreign persons
that receive payments subject to withholding under sections 1441
or 1442 of the Internal Revenue Code are in 1.1441-1(e),
1.1441-4(a)(2), 1.1441-4(b) (1) and (2), 1.1441-4(c), (d) and
(e), 1.1441-5(a)(2)(ii), 1.1441-5(b),  1.1441-6(b) and (c),
1.1441-8(b), 1.1441-9(b), 1.1461-1(b) and (c), 301.6114-1, and
301.6402-3(e), 31.3401(a)(6)-1(e).  This information is required
by the IRS to identify and verify the status of persons to whom
payments of U.S. source income is made.  This information will be
used to claim foreign person status and, in appropriate cases, to
claim residence in a country with which the United States has an
income tax treaty in effect, so that withholding at a reduced
rate of tax may be obtained at source.  The likely respondents
and recordkeepers are individuals, state or local governments,
farms, business or other for-profit institutions, federal
agencies, nonprofit institutions, and small business or
organizations.   Responses to this collection of information are
mandatory.
     Books or records relating to a collection of information
must be retained as long as their contents may become material in
the administration of any internal revenue law.  Generally, tax
returns and tax return information are confidential, as required
by 26 U.S.C. 6103.
     The burden for the reporting requirement contained in
1.1441-1(e)(2), 1.1441-4(a)(2), 1.1441-4(b)(2), 1.1441-4(c)(2),
1.1441-4(d), 1.1441-4(e)(1), (2) and (3), 1.1441-6(b), 1.1441-
8(b), 1.1441-9(a)(2), 301.6114-1(b)(4), and 301.6402-3(e) will be
reflected in the burden of Form W-8, Form 8833, Form 8233, and
the income tax return of a foreign person filed for purposes of
claiming a refund of tax.
     The collection of information requirement for corporations
contained in 1.6049-4(c) will be reflected in the burden of Form
W-8.
     The requirement for the recordkeeping requirement in
1.6049-5(c)(1)(ii) and (iii) is in an existing regulation,
appearing in TD 7966 that was approved under OMB number 1545-
0112. 
Background
     This document contains proposed amendments to the Income Tax
Regulations (CFR parts 1, 31, 35a and 301) under sections 163(f),
165(j), 871, 881, 1441, 1442, 1461, 1462, 1463, 3401, 3406, 6041,
6041A, 6042, 6045, 6049, 6050N, 6109, 6114, 6402, and 6413 of the
Internal Revenue Code (Code).  This document also proposes to
remove certain regulations under income tax treaties.
Explanation of Provisions
A.  Current rules  
     These proposed regulations deal with the withholding of tax
under section 1441, 1442, or 1443 on amounts paid to foreign
persons, procedures for claiming foreign status to avoid backup
withholding under section 3406 on certain payments, and the
reporting to the IRS of payments to foreign persons.  Reporting
to the IRS may be required under sections 6011 and 1461 or under
the reporting provisions of chapter 61 of the Code, such as
sections 6041, 6041A, 6042, 6044, 6045, 6049, 6050H, and 6050N,
(the 1099 reporting provisions). 
1.   U.S. income tax on U.S. source income of foreign persons.
     Under sections 871(a) and 881(a) of the Code, non-resident
alien individuals and foreign corporations are subject to a 30
percent tax on most items of income they receive from sources
within the United States that are not effectively connected with
the conduct of a trade or business in the United States.  Income
taxable under these provisions includes interest, dividends,
royalties, compensation, and other fixed or determinable annual
or periodical income.  The tax liability imposed under section
871(a) and 881(a) is generally collected by way of withholding at
source under section 1441(a) (for payments to non-resident alien
individuals and foreign partnerships) or under section 1442(a)
(for payments to foreign corporations).  Special withholding
provisions apply under section 1443 to payments of certain income
to foreign tax-exempt entities.
     The 30 percent rate is often reduced under the Code or an 
income tax treaty.  Under current regulations, a withholding
agent may generally rely on a statement furnished by, or on
behalf of, the beneficial owner certifying entitlement to a
reduced rate.  For example, the portfolio interest exception
under section 871(h) and 881(c) is conditioned upon the
beneficial owner of the interest providing a statement of foreign
status to the U.S. withholding agent, which can be provided on a
Form W-8.  See 35a.9999-5(b), A-9.  If a reduction is claimed
under an income tax treaty, the withholding agent may generally
rely on a Form 1001 provided by, or on behalf of, the beneficial
owner claiming residence in a treaty country.  For dividends,
however, no certification is required and the withholding agent
may generally rely on the address of the payee in the treaty
country.  The procedural requirements for claiming a reduced rate
of withholding may vary depending upon the type of income, the
taxpayer, or whether a treaty is involved.  
     A withholding agent is generally required to file an annual
income tax return on Form 1042 to report amounts upon which a tax
was actually withheld under chapter 3 of the Code or would have
been required to be withheld but for an exemption under the Code,
the regulations, or an income tax treaty.  An information return
on a Form 1042-S must be attached to the Form 1042 and report
each recipient's name and address, amounts paid, and taxes
withheld, if any.  Section 1.1461-2(b) and (c).
2.   Backup withholding
     Under chapter 61 of the Code and section 3406, a reportable
payment, as defined in section 3406(b), is subject to backup
withholding at the rate of 31 percent unless the payor receives a
taxpayer identifying number (TIN), generally on a Form W-9, and,
for reportable interest and dividends, a certification that the
payee is not subject to notified payee underreporting.  The payor
of a reportable payment is also generally required to file Form
1099 with the IRS showing the name, address, and TIN of the
payee; the amount of the payment; and the amount that was
withheld, if any.  The payor must also provide a copy of Form
1099 to the payee, who must report the payment on an income tax
return to the extent the payment constitutes gross income.  A
payor that fails to obtain a TIN or other required information or
to backup withhold when required under section 3406 may also be
liable under section 3403 for the amount that should have been
withheld.  Information reporting by payors is critical to a
matching system that allows the IRS to match information provided
by payors with income reported on a payee's return.
     The information reporting provisions of chapter 61 provide
guidance to help payors determine when payments are made to a
foreign person and, therefore, exempt from 1099 reporting and
backup withholding.  Generally, depending upon the type of
payment involved, a payor may rely on a certification of foreign
status made on Form W-8, Form 1001, Form 4224, or on documentary
evidence.  Therefore, even though an amount is exempt from
withholding under chapter 3 of the Code if earned by a foreign
person (e.g., gain from the sale of securities), a payor must
nevertheless comply with specified certification procedures in
order to avoid being subject to backup withholding.  Only amounts
subject to reporting under the 1099 reporting provisions can be
subject to backup withholding under section 3406.  Therefore,
payments to foreign persons that are exempt from reporting are
also exempt from backup withholding.
B.  Need for reform
     The IRS and Treasury have reviewed the current withholding
and reporting procedures applicable to cross-border flows of
income and have concluded that changes are necessary in view of
the substantial growth in such flows over the past 15 years.  The
IRS and Treasury have concluded that allowing the benefit of the
reduced rate at source continues to be desirable.  A system that
reduces withholding at source permits an investor to receive its
full income without the administrative costs and delays that can
occur when applying for a refund of withheld taxes.  This
advantage, however, is necessarily accompanied by the need to
rely, in part, on withholding agents.  Withholding agents perform
an important compliance function as recipients of the necessary
documentation substantiating claims of foreign status and of
reduced rates of withholding and as providers of information to
the IRS.  
     One of the important objectives of the proposed revisions is
to eliminate unnecessary burdens that the lack of 
standardization and coordination of current procedures imposes on
withholding agents.  For example, under current rules, different
forms must be used for different purposes; different standards of
proof apply for establishing foreign status for purposes of the
1099 reporting provisions (and the related backup withholding
provisions) and of the Chapter 3 withholding provisions.  Also,
the revisions seek to facilitate compliance by clarifying many of
the uncertainties under current procedures (e.g., the scope of
due diligence standards imposed on withholding agents).  This
proposal also addresses the important issue of payments to
intermediaries (nominees, agents, etc.) and whether, in the case
of interest, dividends, and gross proceeds from publicly traded
or widely held obligations or stocks, intermediaries should
certify status on behalf of beneficial owners and, if so, how.  
     Under current rules, nominee procedures work differently for
different types of income.  For example, a U.S. broker redeeming
a short-term obligation held by a foreign financial institution
as an agent may exempt the payment from 1099 reporting and backup
withholding and grant the exemption from the 30 percent tax under
section 871(a) without having to obtain certificates or
documentation.  If the foreign financial institution makes a
payment to another person offshore then no certification or
documentation is required.  On the other hand if, for example,
the foreign financial institution, remitted the amount to a
person in the United States through a U.S. office, it might have
to obtain a Form W-8 or a Form W-9.  In contrast, interest on
registered obligations may not qualify as portfolio interest
under sections 871(h) and 881(c) unless the U.S. withholding
agent receives a statement that the beneficial owner of the
obligation is not a U.S. person (see section 871(h)(2)(B)(ii)). 
Current regulations implement this condition by requiring that a
beneficial owner certification be passed up through a chain of
intermediaries to the U.S. withholding agent.  These procedures
have proved difficult to implement in a number of cases and these
proposed regulations offer alternative procedures.  The proposed
revisions, therefore, respond to the concerns expressed by
various representatives of the financial community regarding the
cost of complying with current procedures and potential harm to
the competitiveness of U.S. financial institutions in handling
investment transactions in the United States and abroad.  
     These proposed regulations are also responsive to the
Congressional mandate in section 342 of the Tax Equity and Fiscal
Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA) that Treasury consider a range
of options for replacing the address/self-certification method of
administering income tax treaty benefits.  Since 1982, the IRS
and Treasury have studied several options for improving the
withholding tax procedures, including a system of certification
of residence in a treaty country and refund systems.  At hearings
held in February of 1985 on proposed regulations issued in 1984
under section 1441, comments from the public and several U.S.
treaty partners made it apparent that certification requirements,
as proposed, would create too many administrative problems for
payments made through nominees.  The proposed revisions take
these comments into account and propose to rely on procedures
essentially identical to the procedures proposed for portfolio
interest on registered obligations.
     The streamlining of current procedures and the
implementation of workable nominee certification procedures
represent a substantial simplification and reduction of burden. 
The IRS and Treasury expect that this, in turn, should result in
greater compliance and improve the ability by withholding agents
and the IRS to detect abusive claims under U.S. income tax
treaties or under the Code.
C.  Summary of proposal
1.  Changes affecting portfolio-type investments
     The proposed regulations under section 1441 and related Code
provisions would substantially revise some aspects of the current
system for withholding on, and reporting of, amounts paid to
foreign persons.  Current certification procedures (i.e., Forms
W-8, 1001, 4224, etc.,) would be unified and reliance standards
would be clarified in an effort to streamline the processing of
cross-border payments, particularly by banks and other financial
institutions.  Most forms (W-8, 1001, 4224, 8709) are proposed to
be combined into a single form (Form W-8).  In addition, taxpayer
identifying numbers are not required to be stated on withholding
certificates, with certain limited exceptions that do not affect
market-based transactions.  These changes are important steps
toward reducing the burden on withholding agents and assisting
taxpayer compliance.  
     The address rule for claiming tax treaty benefits for
dividends is proposed to be eliminated.  Instead, dividends would
be made subject to the same beneficial owner and intermediary
certification procedures as are proposed for portfolio interest
on registered obligations.  It is also proposed to apply the same
procedures to bank deposit interest (as described in section
871(i)(2)(A)).  On the other hand, the documentary evidence
procedures currently in effect for bank deposit interest on
accounts held with foreign branches would be continued and would
be applied as well to offshore payments of dividends on publicly
traded stocks and portfolio interest on registered obligations. 
Therefore, documentary evidence would become the general rule for
dividends and interest earned on accounts held with foreign
branches.  These proposed changes illustrate the effort by the
IRS and Treasury to eliminate unnecessary procedural differences
in order to reduce the burden on withholding agents.
     The proposal does not generally affect other important
classes of investment transactions.  Thus, current portfolio
interest rules for bearer obligations (including commercial
paper), convertible obligations, pass-through certificates, as
well as rules for broker proceeds and short term obligations
would be retained.  In order to further simplify compliance, the
regulations under section 165(j) (1.165-12) are proposed to be
revised to eliminate the requirements that, in connection with
delivery of bearer obligations, holders receive statements and
send confirmations.  Provisions regarding foreign-targeted
registered obligations are to be retained.  However, because
these special procedures have been rarely used, comments are
solicited on their usefulness and whether they should be
retained.
     Foreign intermediary procedures as currently applicable to
portfolio interest (which are proposed to become applicable to
dividends and bank deposit interest as well) are substantially
revised by providing several options, allowing different
taxpayers to comply in different ways.  These options recognize
that it is appropriate to adapt withholding requirements to
accommodate different types of transactions and should provide
substantial relief from current requirements.  
     In order to allow sufficient time for transition, the
regulations are proposed to be generally effective for payments
made after 1997.  In addition, withholding agents would be
allowed to continue to rely on existing certificates after that
date until their validity expires as determined under current
rules.  Comments are solicited on whether these proposed
effective dates leave adequate time to implement necessary system
changes. 
     The regulations proposed in 1988 regarding the reporting by
U.S. banks of bank deposit interest paid to Canadian residents
are finalized, effective for payments made on or after January 1,
1997 with respect to Forms W-8 furnished on or after that date. 
See the Rules and Regulations section of this issue of the
Federal Register.
2.   Intermediary procedures options for portfolio interest,
dividends on publicly traded stock, and bank deposit interest.
     The proposed regulations offer intermediary certification
options designed to simplify compliance by withholding agents. 
These procedures would be mostly relevant to portfolio interest
on registered obligations, dividends on publicly traded stocks
(eliminating the address rule), and interest paid on bank
deposits (as described in section 871(i)(2)(A)).  First, for
portfolio interest on registered obligations, the current
certification procedures would be retained, as an option and are
not reproposed.  See 35a.9999-5(b), A-9.  These rules will be
included in final regulations in proposed 1.871-14(c)(2)(iii)
and, accordingly, that section of the proposed regulations is
reserved.  Preserving the existing regulations is designed to
accommodate those taxpayers and withholding agents for whom the
current rules work appropriately.  
      The regulations propose to add two new procedures.  First,
a withholding agent would be allowed to rely on an intermediary
Form W-8 furnished on behalf of one or more beneficial owners (or
other intermediaries) without having to obtain beneficial owner
documentation if the intermediary has entered into a withholding
agreement with the IRS and, thus, is a "qualified intermediary." 
In a chain of intermediaries, an intermediary would be allowed to
rely on the intermediary Form W-8 of another qualified
intermediary.  If the other intermediary is not qualified, the
qualified intermediary would generally be required to obtain
beneficial owner documentation from the other non-qualified
intermediary.  The qualified intermediary would then pass such
documentation up the chain or rely on such documentation when
issuing its intermediary Form W-8.   
     Under the withholding agreement procedure, a qualified
intermediary would agree with the IRS to obtain such
documentation or certifications as the agreement would specify. 
It is contemplated that institutions that are subject to bona
fide "know-your-customer" procedures under their domestic laws
will generally be permitted to rely on such procedures.  The
withholding agreement will generally include provisions for
beneficial owner information to be reported or made available to
the IRS and for the IRS to audit such information.  In
appropriate cases, the reporting and audit may be limited to the
beneficial ownership information pertaining to U.S. source income
(other than gross proceeds) of U.S. customers or to an audit of
the reports prepared by, and the methodology employed by, the
approved external auditors of the qualified intermediary. 
     The regulations propose a second intermediary procedure
permitting a foreign agent of a U.S. withholding agent to act on
behalf of the withholding agent.  While the U.S. withholding
agent would remain liable for the acts (or failures to act) of
its agent, the proposed procedure streamlines the withholding
process as the foreign agent would collect the appropriate
documentation on behalf of the U.S. withholding agent and report
beneficial owner information to the IRS without having to furnish
the documentation to the U.S. withholding agent.  The
documentation requirements under this procedure would be the same
as those normally applicable to withholding agents.
     Lastly, the proposed regulations provide that the U.S.
competent authority may agree to special withholding procedures
with a foreign competent authority under an income tax treaty. 
The United States intends to consult with its tax treaty partners
before implementing changes that would affect its relationship
with its treaty partners.
3.  Use of taxpayer identifying number.
     A taxpayer identifying number (TIN) is not required to be
shown on withholding documents provided for income on portfolio-
type investments.  
     A TIN continues to be required for claims of effectively
connected income.  A TIN would also be required to support claims
of benefits under an income tax treaty (other than dividends on
publicly traded stocks).  Therefore, for example, payments of
dividends on non-publicly traded stocks, royalties, or related
party interest would require a TIN to be shown on the withholding
certificate in order for a withholding agent to rely on a claim
of a reduced rate under a tax treaty.
     In the case of an individual, a TIN would generally be an
IRS individual taxpayer identifying number (ITIN) issued by the
IRS to a nonresident alien individual who is not otherwise
eligible for a Social Security Number.  In the case of a non-
individual, a TIN would be an Employer Identification Number
(EIN).  Over time, the IRS will issue EIN's to foreign persons
that begin with the two digits "98" to permit instant recognition
of foreign status.  See regulations proposed under section 6109
contained in project number INTL-0024-94, published on June 8,
1995 (60 FR 302111), describing the types of taxpayer identifying
numbers issued to nonresident alien individuals and the manner in
which a number can be obtained.  Further revisions to the
regulations under section 6109 are proposed in order to require
the statement of a TIN in appropriate cases. 
4.  Other proposed changes 
     The regulations propose to clarify the extent of due
diligence expected from certain withholding agents, such as banks
and other financial institutions.  Thus, for payments of
portfolio-type income, the withholding agent's due diligence
would be limited to an examination of the address stated on the
withholding certificate.  If the address on the certificate were
a U.S. address or did not match the address information in its
records, the withholding agent would have to seek further proof
of a claim of foreign status.  This change would not affect the
current requirement that a withholding agent cannot ignore what
it actually knows when determining the extent to which it may
rely on a withholding certificate.  However, in the case of
financial institutions, knowledge would be limited to information
that can be associated with the account under the same procedures
as apply for purposes of the backup withholding provisions.
     As a further burden reduction, the regulations propose to
eliminate the requirement to attach withholding certificates to
Forms 1042 and 1042-S.  The current reporting requirements are
otherwise unchanged except for clarification of how these
requirements apply in the case of payments to intermediaries. 
Therefore, even though certification procedures are proposed to
be modified for bank deposit interest, such interest continues to
be exempt from reporting (except for certain interest on bank
deposits paid to Canadian residents).  
     The period of validity of a certificate of foreign status
(Form W-8) is limited to three years as under current law. 
However, a Form W-8 stating a beneficial owner's TIN is proposed
to be valid indefinitely if it relates to income required to be
reported to the IRS (or if the TIN is actually reported even
though not otherwise required).  The validity period for
certificates used to claim a reduced rate for effectively
connected income is proposed to be extended from one year to
three years.
     The regulations propose new procedures dealing with payments
to foreign partnerships.  These procedures generally would allow
looking through to the partners and reliance on a certification
provided for each partner.  Alternatively, in order to facilitate
certification for partnerships with many partners or for tiered
partnerships, the regulations would also allow a foreign
partnership to be a qualified intermediary under an agreement
with the IRS.  In that case, the partnership would be allowed to
furnish an intermediary certificate for the partnership.  The
partnership would be required to withhold under section 1441 in
the same manner as a domestic partnership.  In addition, the
regulations would clarify the manner in which a foreign entity
and its interest holders can determine entitlement to benefits
under an income tax treaty with a particular country based upon
the principles in effect under the laws of that country.
     The proposed regulations also address the practical
difficulties that exist under current rules due to the lack of
clear guidelines on determining the status of a payee as a U.S.
or a foreign person in the absence of documentation.  While some
guidelines exist in limited cases (e.g., 35a.9999-5(b) A-10),
guidance is incomplete.  The proposed regulations offer a
comprehensive and uniform set of presumptions to assist
withholding agents with these determinations. 
5.  Changes to reporting rules under chapter 61 of the Internal
Revenue Code

     On February 29, 1988, the IRS and Treasury published in
project number INTL-52-86 (53 FR 5991) proposed amendments to the
1099 information reporting regulations (the 1988 proposed
regulations) modifying the reporting requirements and the
procedures for presenting a claim of foreign status.  The
provisions in the 1988 proposed regulations concerning
information reporting of bank deposit interest paid to persons
resident in Canada are finalized.  See 1.6049-5(e)(2) of the
1988 proposed regulations and the Rules and Regulations section 
of this issue of the Federal Register.  The 1988 proposed
regulations are not otherwise amended.  In order to standardize
procedures, changes are proposed to the procedures for certifying
foreign status that were proposed in 1988 so as to conform them
to those proposed under section 1441.  The IRS and Treasury are
considering finalizing the 1988 proposed regulations at the same
time that the proposed regulations under section 1441 are
finalized.
Proposed effective dates
     Unless otherwise provided in the regulations, the
regulations are proposed to be effective for payments made after
December 31, 1997.  The regulations contain a number of
transition rules designed to phase out currently outstanding
withholding certificates (e.g., Forms W-8 and 1001).
               Section-by-section analysis
1.163-5  Denial of interest deduction on certain obligations
issued after December 31, 1982, unless issued in registered form
     Section 1.163-5(c) contains foreign targeting procedures
applicable to certain obligations issued in bearer form.  Section
1.163-5(c)(2)(i)(B)(5) would be revised to modify the cross-
reference to the documentary evidence rules since the Q&A
regulations under part 35a are proposed to be eliminated. 
1.165-12  Denial of deduction for losses on registration-
required obligations not in registered form
     
     Section 165(j)(1) and 1.165-12(a) deny a loss deduction to
a holder of a registration-required obligation that is not in 
registered form unless the holder meets certain exceptions. 
Under 1.165-12(c)(1)(iii) and (iv), the loss disallowance rule
does not apply to a holder that delivers a registration-required
obligation that is in bearer form and that is offered or sold in
the United States if the holder delivers the obligation to a
financial institution, and the financial institution provides a
statement that it is a financial institution within the meaning
of 1.165-12(c)(1)(v), it is purchasing the obligation for its
own account, the account of another financial institution, or an
exempt organization, that will comply with section 165(j)(3)(A),
(B), or (C).  The loss disallowance rule also does not apply if a
holder delivers a registration-required obligation in bearer form
that is offered or sold outside the United States if it is
delivered to a financial institution and the holder gives the
financial institution a confirmation stating that any U.S.
taxpayer that holds the obligation in bearer form and that is not
exempt under section 165(j)(3)(A), (B), or (C) will be denied a
deduction for any loss or capital gain treatment with respect to
the obligation.  A holder may deliver a registration-required
obligation in bearer form that is offered and sold outside the
United States to a person other than a financial institution only
if the holder has documentary evidence, as described in
35a.9999-4T, A-5 that the person is not a U.S. person.
     These proposed regulations would revise 1.165-12(c)(1)(iv)
to eliminate the requirement that the holder receive a statement
from a financial institution for bearer obligations offered or
sold in the United States.  The proposed regulations would also
eliminate the requirement that the holder deliver a confirmation
to a financial institution for obligations offered or sold
outside the United States.  These changes are proposed to reduce
the documentation burden associated with secondary market
transactions.  The documentary evidence requirement for delivery
outside the United States to a foreign person other than a
financial institution is retained.  The proposed regulations
would clarify that the holder may receive such evidence
electronically.
1.871-14  Rules for portfolio interest.
     Under section 871(h) and 881(c), interest that qualifies as
portfolio interest is generally exempt from tax and is exempt
from withholding at source under section 1441(b)(9).  Section
1.871-14 proposes procedures governing whether interest
(including original issue discount) qualifies as portfolio
interest described in section 871(h)(2).  Section 1.1441-2(d)
provides the exemption from withholding.  
     For interest on bearer obligations, the existing provisions
in 35a.9999-5(a), A-1 (dealing with portfolio interest on bearer
obligations) and in 35a.9999-5(c) (dealing with convertible
obligations) will be incorporated in 1.871-14(b) without
substantive changes and are not reproposed.  These rules will be
restated in proposed 1.871-14(b)(1) and (b)(2) that are
currently shown as reserved.
     For interest on registered obligations, section
871(h)(2)(B)(ii) provides that such interest qualifies as
portfolio interest only if the U.S. withholding agent receives a
statement that the beneficial owner is not a United States
person.  Paragraph (c)(2)(i) provides that the statement
requirement would be satisfied if the beneficial owner furnishes
the type of documents described in proposed 1.1441-1(e)(1)(i)
for a withholding agent to rely on a claim of foreign status. 
Thus, in the case of a payment to a beneficial owner, the
beneficial owner must provide a beneficial owner withholding
certificate described in proposed 1.1441-1(e)(2) or, if the
payment is made on an account held at a foreign branch,
documentary evidence may be substituted (see paragraph
(c)(2)(ii)).  The ability to use documentary evidence on foreign
branch accounts is a significant change from current law and one
that intends to reduce the burden on transactions outside the
United States.  Further, as under current regulations, the
withholding certificate would not have to state a taxpayer
identifying number (although one may be provided, if desired). 
See 35a.9999-5(b), A-9.
      In the case of a payment to a foreign person that acts as
an intermediary (e.g., an agent, representative, nominee, etc.),
the proposed procedures under section 1441 would require either
that the intermediary furnish an intermediary withholding
certificate or, if the intermediary acts as the agent of the
withholding agent, that the intermediary be an authorized foreign
agent.  Under proposed 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iv) or proposed 1.871-
14(c)(2)(iii), the certificate could be, as under current rules,
a certificate to which the beneficial owner documentation is
attached (see 35a.9999-5(b), A-9).  Alternatively, under
proposed 1.1441-1(e)(3)(ii), it could be a certificate by which
the intermediary certifies for the beneficial owner (or other
intermediaries) without being required to attach beneficial owner
documentation.  The latter certificate could be issued only by a
qualified intermediary, i.e., a person that has an agreement with
the IRS.  The qualified intermediary certificate would be issued
based upon certifications or documentation obtained by the
qualified intermediary.  The same standards would apply to these
documents as are proposed to be applied to documents that a U.S.
withholding agent is required to obtain when paying directly to a
beneficial owner.  Therefore, a taxpayer identifying number is
not required to be shown on a beneficial owner withholding
certificate provided to the qualified intermediary. 
Alternatively, the qualified intermediary could rely on
documentary evidence for accounts held at foreign branches.  In
addition, different procedures may apply under the terms of a
qualified intermediary's agreement with the IRS. 
     Where a withholding agent acts through an authorized foreign
agent, certificates received by the agent would be deemed to be
received by the withholding agent.  In that case, no certificate
would be required from the authorized agent.  See proposed
1.1441-7(c)(2) for the description of an authorized foreign
agent and proposed 1.1461-1(b)(2)(iii) and (c)(4)(iii) for the
filing of returns by the withholding agent and its authorized
foreign agent.  Paragraph (c)(2)(iv) specifies that other
procedures may apply under a competent authority agreement with a
country with which the United States has an income tax treaty.  
     The regulations clarify the consequences of a late-received
Form W-8 or other documentation.  Paragraph (c)(3) provides that
the withholding certificate may be received by the withholding
agent at any time before expiration of the beneficial owner's
period of limitation for claiming a refund of tax with respect to
the interest.  The applicable period is described in section
6511(a).  Under this rule, a foreign person would be allowed, for
example, to provide the required certificate to a U.S.
withholding agent (or its authorized foreign agent) at any time
prior to filing an income tax return and still be able to qualify
the interest as portfolio interest.  However, a withholding agent
that does not hold a valid certificate (or other valid
documentation) when paying the interest would be required to
withhold.  Failure to do so would make the withholding agent
liable for the tax if the required certification or documentation
procedures are not complied with prior to the expiration of the
beneficial owner's period of limitation.  If a withholding agent
fails to withhold although it does not hold a valid certificate,
but the documentation procedures are ultimately complied with, a
withholding agent would be liable for interest pursuant to
section 1463 even though there is no underlying tax liability. 
In addition, the withholding agent may be subject to penalties
for failure to withhold tax.  See proposed 1.1441-1(f)(5).  
     Paragraphs (d) and (e) are reserved.  Paragraph (d) will
reflect the rules in 35a.9999-5(e), regarding pass-through
certificates.  Paragraph (e) will reflect the rules in 35a.9999-
5(b) A-12 through A-15 regarding foreign-targeted registered
obligations.  These rules are not reproposed.  Under 1.871-
14(g), the rules contained in proposed regulation 1.871-14 are 
proposed to be effective for payments of interest after December
31, 1997.  However, withholding agents may continue to rely on
valid Forms W-8 that they hold on the date that is 60 days after
the regulations become final until the forms expire under the
rules as in effect on April 22, 1996.  
1.1441-1  Requirement for the withholding of tax on payments to
foreign persons.
     This section states the general rules concerning withholding
on payments to foreign persons.  Paragraph (a) provides the
general purpose and scope of the section. Paragraph (b) states
the general rule that a withholding agent must withhold 30
percent of the gross amount of income subject to withholding if
paid to a foreign person unless the beneficial owner of the
income is a U.S. person or is a foreign person entitled to a
reduced rate of tax.  A withholding agent may grant a reduced
rate at source in the case of a payment to a foreign person only
if, before payment, it can associate the appropriate
documentation with the payment.  Therefore, actual knowledge that
the beneficial owner is a foreign person would not excuse the
obligation to obtain appropriate documentation.  A withholding
agent failing to act in accordance with these rules may
ultimately be relieved from the liability for the tax under
section 1461, but would, in any event, be liable for interest,
and possibly, penalties.  See paragraph (f)(5).  For this
purpose, payment to a foreign person includes a payment to a U.S.
person if the withholding agent has actual knowledge or reason to
know that the U.S. person is acting as the agent of a foreign
person.  These rules restate current law.  See 1.1441-1 and
1.1441-7(a)(1) of the existing regulations.
     Paragraph (c) defines terms, including payee and beneficial
owner.  Paragraph (c)(3) defines a payee as the person to whom
the payment is made.  This definition has significance for
purposes of coordinating the section 1441 withholding provisions
with the 1099 reporting and backup withholding rules under
chapter 61 of the Code and section 3406, respectively (the 1099
reporting and backup withholding provisions determine
consequences of payments based on payees; in contrast, the
section 1441 withholding provisions determine consequences of
payments based on beneficial owner).  In the case of a payment to
a foreign partnership, paragraph (c)(3)(ii) provides that the
partners, and not the partnership, are considered to be the
payees.  However, a foreign partnership could be considered a
payee if it certified to the withholding agent that it is a
qualified intermediary (see paragraph (e)(5) regarding qualified
intermediaries) or if it certified that the income is effectively
connected with a U.S. trade or business (in which case, the
partnership must itself withhold the tax required under section
1446).  The provisions specify how these rules would apply on a
look-through basis to tiered partnership structures.  
     Under paragraph (c)(6), a beneficial owner is defined as the
person who, under U.S. tax principles, would be required to
include the amount paid in gross income.  Therefore, under these
principles, partners, and not partnerships, are the beneficial
owners (unless the partner is itself a partnership, in which
case, one looks through to the partners of the highest tier
foreign partnership).  Therefore, the identification of a
beneficial owner is influenced by the classification of the
entity to which the payment is made.  This proposed rule revises
1.1441-3(f) of the existing regulations that, in effect, treats
a partnership as a beneficial owner for purposes of the
withholding provisions.  This provision has created difficulties
for partners of a foreign partnership who wish to claim the
benefit of a reduced rate at source based on their status, but
may not do so because the entity does not qualify for the reduced
rate.  The proposed regulations would alleviate these
difficulties by permitting beneficial owner information to be
passed to the withholding agent or by permitting the partnership
to be a qualified intermediary.
     The IRS and Treasury are aware that some large investment
partnerships hold significant amounts of U.S. portfolio type
investments.  The IRS and Treasury understand that generally
these entities are treated as corporations under the provisions
of section 7704(c)(3) and the regulations under that section. 
Therefore, the proposed revisions requiring beneficial owner
documentation for partners would not adversely affect these
entities.  The IRS and Treasury solicit comments on this point.
     Generally, the determination of the classification of an
entity, including an entity organized in a foreign country, is
made under U.S. tax rules.  Because U.S. and foreign laws may
differ on classification principles, the U.S. tax classification
of an entity as a partnership or a corporation may differ from
the tax treatment of that entity under the laws of a foreign
country.  Therefore, in the case of income paid to a foreign
entity, the entity might be considered the beneficial owner under
U.S. tax principles (because it is classified as an association
taxable as a corporation under U.S. tax principles), but, if
foreign tax principles are applied, its interest holders, rather
than the entity, might be considered the beneficial owners.  This
dual characterization may give rise to difficulties in the
application of income tax treaties.  In order to alleviate these
difficulties, paragraph (c)(6)(ii)(B) proposes that foreign tax
principles, rather than U.S. tax principles, apply to identify
the beneficial owner of income for which a claim of a reduced
rate of withholding is made based upon a tax treaty.   Under this
proposed rule, when a benefit is claimed under a tax treaty with
a particular country, the tax principles that govern the
determination of who the beneficial owner is for purposes of
obtaining benefits under that treaty would be the principles in
effect under the laws of that country.  This clarification is
intended to address the significant uncertainties resulting from
the current lack of guidance on these issues.  The IRS and
Treasury intend to consult with treaty partners in order to
promote uniformity in this area.  Paragraph (c)(6)(iii) provides
that the beneficial owner rules in the proposed regulations would
not apply to trusts.  Until further guidance is provided, the
rules in the current regulations would continue to apply trusts. 
See 1.1441-3(f) and (g) of the existing regulations.
     While different procedures would apply depending upon
whether a payment is made to a corporation or a partnership, a
withholding agent would not be required to determine the
classification of an entity when making a payment to a foreign
person.  Rather, a withholding agent would be allowed to rely on
the classification claimed by the entity, unless it had actual
knowledge or reason to know otherwise.    
     Paragraph (d) deals with procedures that would enable a
withholding agent to determine the circumstances in which it
could consider that the payment is made to a U.S. person and is,
therefore, exempt from section 1441 withholding.  This paragraph
replaces 1.1441-5 of the existing regulations and proposes to
replace Form 1078 with Form W-9, consistent with the manner in
which a U.S. payee must generally provide a taxpayer identifying
number under section 3406.  In the case of a payment to an exempt
recipient or a payment of scholarship, grant, pension, or
annuities, for which no Form W-9 is required under section 3406,
a person also would be permitted to use a Form W-9 to establish
its U.S. status. The regulations specify the information that
must be stated on such a certificate, which parallels that
required under 31.3406(h)-3(e)(2) in order for a payor to
reasonably rely on a Form W-9.  If no, or insufficient,
documentation is provided, the presumptions in 1.1441-1(f) would
apply to determine whether the beneficial owner should be treated
as a foreign or U.S. person.
     In the case of a payment to a foreign person acting as an
intermediary (e.g., agent, representative, or nominee) for a U.S.
person, paragraph (d)(3) provides that the intermediary may
transmit a Form W-9 for the U.S. person to claim U.S. status and
avoid section 1441 withholding.  If the U.S. person is not an
exempt recipient, the withholding agent would then have to comply
with the 1099 reporting requirements under chapter 61 of the
Code, because, under these rules, the U.S. person would be
treated as a payee.  Similarly, as a result of the payee rules
set forth in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) dealing with payments to
foreign partnerships, a withholding agent may treat a payment to
a foreign partnership as a payment made to a U.S. person to the
extent of the U.S. partner's distributive share of that payment. 
Similarly, the withholding agent would have to comply with the
1099 reporting requirements. 
     Paragraph (e) describes the conditions for a withholding
agent to rely upon a beneficial owner's claim of foreign status. 
Paragraph (e)(1) provides that a withholding agent may rely upon
a claim of foreign status if, prior to making the payment, the
withholding agent (1) holds a beneficial owner withholding
certificate or an intermediary withholding certificate, (2)
complies with on-line confirmation procedures when prescribed by
the IRS, and (3) has not received a notification from the IRS
that the withholding certificate is incorrect or unreliable.  The
withholding agent's reliance on the withholding certificate is
subject to the withholding agent's actual knowledge or reason to
know otherwise.  See standards of knowledge in proposed 1.1441-
7(b).    
     Paragraph (e)(2) sets forth the requirements for a
beneficial owner withholding certificate.  Generally, a
withholding certificate would be a Form W-8 or, in the case of
certain compensation for personal services, a Form 8233 (or an
acceptable substitute) that is signed under penalties of perjury
by the beneficial owner and contains certain required
information.  The certificate serves as a representation that the
beneficial owner is not a U.S. person and that the conditions for
claiming a reduced rate of withholding tax are satisfied.  These
conditions may vary depending upon the nature of the income or
the type of exemption claimed.    
     Required information on a beneficial owner Form W-8 would
include the beneficial owner's name, permanent residence address, 
the type of income to be received, and the basis for any reduced
rate claimed.  Generally, the Form W-8 would not be required to
state the beneficial owner's taxpayer identifying number ("TIN"),
except in limited cases (see paragraph (e)(4)(vii), below).  
     Paragraph (e)(3) sets forth the requirements for an
intermediary withholding certificate.  Intermediary withholding
certificates may be provided by one of three types of persons: 
(1)  a qualified intermediary, (2) a foreign partnership, or (3)
an agent, nominee, or other representative that is not a
qualified intermediary.
     Information required from a qualified intermediary on a Form
W-8 would include similar information as that required for the
beneficial owner Form W-8 except that the information would
relate to the intermediary.  In addition, the Form W-8 would have
to state a TIN and certify that the issuer is a qualified
intermediary and has obtained the appropriate certificates or
documentation with respect to the account holders covered by the
Form W-8.  A foreign partnership that is not a withholding agent
(because it is not a qualified intermediary or acting for the
account of others) would have to provide the same information
about itself, and attach the partners' withholding certificates. 
In addition, the partnership would be required to state an EIN on
the withholding certificate.  See proposed 1.1441-5(b) for the
certificates required to be attached in the case of tiered
partnerships.  See also, proposed 1.1461-1(c)(4)(v) for Form
1042-S filing requirements for the withholding agent.  
     An agent, nominee, or representative furnishing an
intermediary certificate would have to provide information about
itself, state an EIN for the intermediary (or an SSN or ITIN in
the case of an individual) and certify that it is not acting for
its own account and is using the Form W-8 to transmit beneficial
owner certification for the payment to which the Form W-8
relates.  These procedures are essentially similar to those in
effect for portfolio interest on registered obligations under
1.9999-5(b), A9 and that are proposed to be retained in proposed
1.871-14(c)(2)(iii). 
     Paragraph (e)(4)(i) requires that, in the case of joint
owners, each owner provide a withholding certificate.  This rule
would parallel the requirements for backup withholding purposes. 
See 31.3406(h)-2(a).
     Paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(A) provides the general rule that a
withholding certificate would be valid for a period of three
years or until the circumstances of the beneficial owner changed,
making an item of information on the certificate incorrect. 
However, under paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(B), a withholding certificate
that includes a TIN would be valid indefinitely if the income
(or, under special procedures, the TIN) with which the
certificate is associated were reported to the IRS.  For example,
a bank may rely on a claim of foreign status by an account holder
if it holds a Form W-8 for the account holder even without a TIN. 
In that case, the certificate would be valid for a period of
three years only.  If, however, the account holder were to state
a TIN on the form and the bank adopted procedures by which it
reports the TIN to the IRS as provided in proposed 1.1461-1(d),
the certificate would be valid indefinitely until a change in
circumstances of the account holder made the information on the
form incorrect.  
     Second, certificates furnished to claim a reduced rate of
withholding on income that is effectively connected with the
conduct of a trade of business within the United States would
also be limited to three years in all circumstances.   This is a
change from existing regulations under 1.1441-4(a)(2) that
require that a new certificate be filed each year.  This change
would relieve the burden associated with annual renewal of these
certificates and simplify compliance by providing uniform
validity period rules.  The 3-year period of validity for this
certificate would extend from the date it is signed to the last
day of the third succeeding calendar year.  This change would
insure a full 3-year validity period in all cases (and up to four
years where the certificate is furnished at the beginning of the
calendar year).
     Under paragraph (e)(4)(iii), withholding certificates must
be retained for as long as they are relevant for the
determination of the withholding agent's liability under proposed
1.1461-1.  This rule would replace the 4-year retention period
under current law and conform the rules under section 1441 to the
retention period required for Forms W-9 under section 3406.  This
change is necessary because the Form W-8, like Form W-9, is
proposed to be made valid indefinitely in certain circumstances. 
Paragraph (e)(4)(iv) anticipates the possibility that, in the
future, a withholding agent may rely on electronically
transmitted information otherwise required to be stated on a
withholding certificate.  
     Paragraph (e)(4)(v) provides for on-line confirmation
procedures for TIN's required to be stated on withholding
certificates in order to verify their correctness and the claim
that it belongs to a foreign person.  Such procedures are being
developed by the IRS and, when the system becomes operational,
the IRS may require certain categories of withholding agents
handling large volumes of payments to foreign persons (such as
certain teaching institutions) to perform on-line confirmation of
such TIN's.  These procedures would be similar to those currently
in use under section 3406 in order to notify payors of an
incorrect TIN.
     Paragraph (e)(4)(vi) defines an acceptable substitute form. 
As under section 3406, these regulations would permit the use of
substitute forms provided the information furnished is the same
as is required under the regulations and is certified to be
correct under penalties of perjury.  See 31.3406(h)-3(c)(1). 
     Paragraph (e)(4)(vii) provides all of the circumstances in
which a taxpayer is required to furnish a TIN on a withholding
certificate for purposes of the regulations under sections 1441,
1442, and 1443.  Taxpayers would be required to furnish a TIN
when claiming the benefit of a reduced rate under an income tax
treaty (other than with respect to dividends on publicly traded
stocks) or because income is effectively connected with a U.S.
trade or business.  In addition, intermediaries, partnerships,
foreign organizations claiming to be tax-exempt under section
501(c), and private foundations would be required to furnish a
TIN.  A TIN would be an IRS Individual Taxpayer Identification
Number (ITIN), a Social Security Number (SSN), or an Employer
Identification Number (EIN).  A nonresident alien individual not
eligible for a social security number would be able to obtain an
ITIN from the IRS.  See proposed regulations under section 6109
describing procedures for obtaining an ITIN.
     Paragraph (e)(5)(i) provides that a qualified intermediary
may furnish a single intermediary withholding certificate to a
withholding agent on behalf of beneficial owners, other
intermediaries, and U.S. payees.  The qualified intermediary
would have to obtain certification or documentation from these
persons on whose behalf the intermediary withholding certificate
is provided.  Generally, the certification and documentation
would be the same as that which a withholding agent is required
to obtain, subject to such modifications as the intermediary's
agreement with the IRS would provide.  It is anticipated that the
terms of the agreement would be flexible enough to accommodate
the individual circumstances of a particular qualified
intermediary, including any locally applicable know-your-customer
rules or practices.  Therefore, the agreement might acknowledge
certain documentary evidence procedures already in place and not
require additional documentation.  Paragraph (e)(5)(ii) provides
that a qualified intermediary is a foreign person that is a party
to a withholding agreement with the IRS and is a clearing
organization as defined in 1.163-5(c)(2)(i)(D)(8), a financial
institution as defined in 1.165-12(c)(1)(iv), a partnership, or
any other person acceptable within the discretion of the IRS.  A
qualified intermediary would be able to either assume primary
responsibility for withholding and reporting to the IRS (if so
permitted under its agreement with the IRS) or leave that
responsibility to the withholding agent.  A qualified
intermediary that assumes primary withholding responsibility
would present an intermediary withholding certificate to the
withholding agent or another qualified intermediary representing
that it will withhold all appropriate amounts and comply with all
applicable reporting requirements.  The withholding agent or
other qualified intermediary would be allowed to rely on such a
certificate and not withhold.  However, the withholding agent
would have to file Forms 1042 and 1042-S under section 1461 to
report the payment to the qualified intermediary and the
qualified intermediary's EIN.  See proposed 1.1461-1(b)(2)(ii)
and (c)(4)(ii).
     A qualified intermediary that does not assume primary
withholding responsibility would present an intermediary
withholding certificate to a U.S. withholding agent or another
qualified intermediary representing that beneficial owners of
U.S. income payments (other than gross proceeds) are not U.S.
persons and, if applicable, qualify for a reduced rate of
withholding.  It is anticipated that a qualified intermediary
would establish separate accounts for income subject to different
withholding rates.  A single intermediary withholding certificate
should serve as documentation for all these separate accounts. 
In addition, the qualified intermediary would provide a Form W-9
for each beneficial owner that is a U.S. person to whom payments
of income otherwise subject to withholding are made and for whom
reporting is required under chapter 61 of the Code.  
     A qualified intermediary would generally have to agree to be
subject to the same reporting requirements as apply to
withholding agents under proposed 1.1461-1(b) and (c), to allow
periodic inspection of its records, and to pay any amount of tax
liability determined to be due.  The IRS intends to agree to
arrangements with the qualified intermediary so that, for
example, inspection of records may be minimized where the IRS
otherwise gets sufficient access to beneficial ownership
information, through annual reporting of TIN's, review of know-
your-customer rules, and selection of appropriate account
information, or through an exchange of information program under
a tax treaty.  In appropriate cases, the IRS may rely on audits
performed by an institution's approved external auditors where,
for example, under an income tax treaty or local laws, the IRS
would be given access to appropriate auditor's records to verify
compliance.  Records may include workpapers of, reports prepared
by, and methodology employed by, the approved external auditors. 
A proposed revenue procedure providing guidance with respect to
withholding agreements has been published as Announcement 96-23
simultaneously with the publication of this document in the
Federal Register.
     Paragraph (e)(5)(v) specifies that a foreign partnership
that is a qualified intermediary acting for its partners is a
withholding agent with respect to its partners' distributive
shares of income paid to the partnership.  In that case, the
partnership is subject to the same withholding and reporting
procedures as would apply to a domestic partnership.  Thus, any
arrangement whereby the partnership would seek to shift primary
withholding responsibility to the withholding agent under the
provisions of paragraph (e)(5)(iv)(B) would not be recognized.
     Paragraph (f) contains a set of presumptions upon which a
withholding agent (for purposes of section 1441) and a payor (for
purposes of the 1099 reporting provisions) would rely to
determine whether to treat a person as U.S. or foreign if, at the
time of payment, the withholding agent or payor does not have
actual knowledge of the status of the person to whom the payment
is made and lacks the required documentation or knows or has
reason to know that the documentation it holds is incorrect or
unreliable.  A presumption under this paragraph (f) could be
rebutted by providing or correcting the required documentation to
the withholding agent or payor.  Thus, these presumptions would
assist the payor in determining whether the income paid is
subject to the 1099 reporting and backup withholding regime (if
paid to a U.S. person that is not an exempt recipient) or to the
section 1441 withholding regime (if paid to a foreign person).   
     Presumptions of foreign status resulting from the
application of these provisions would, when applied for purposes
of section 1441, only affect whether the withholding agent should
withhold 30 percent from the payment on the ground that the
payment may, under the provisions, be treated as made to a
foreign beneficial owner.  However, the presumptions could not
operate to deem the payee as having established proof of foreign
status for purposes of claiming a reduced rate of tax under the
Code or an income tax treaty.  
     Paragraph (f)(2)(i) addresses reportable payments to a non-
exempt recipient (a non-exempt recipient is a person for whom the
payor must file a Form 1099; see proposed 1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii) for
a list of exempt recipients).  Where a withholding agent lacks
the required documentation, it would presume that the payee is a
U.S. individual.  Accordingly, the withholding agent would
withhold 31 percent under section 3406.  Paragraph (f)(2)(ii)
incorporates the concept of the 30-day grace period under
31.3406(d)-3(a) for a payee to furnish a Form W-9 to the payor. 
Because it may take longer to obtain the required documentation
from a foreign person than from a U.S. person, the proposed
regulations allow a withholding agent to treat a payee as a
beneficial owner that is a foreign person for up to 90 days from
the date the agent credits the payee's account (or until the end
of the calendar year if earlier) if the withholding agent has the
name and a foreign address for the account holder or a facsimile
copy or an electronic transmission of the information on a
withholding certificate.  This special rule would defer the
obligation to backup withhold under section 3406 because there
are sufficient indicia of foreign status, but does not defer the
obligation to withhold under section 1441, if applicable.  If the
required documentation were provided or corrected within the 90-
day grace period, the amount withheld may be refunded to the
payee under the adjustment procedures described in proposed
1.1461-2.  The 90-day grace period would be terminated if any
part of the proceeds in the account that are subject to the grace
period were withdrawn (other than for purposes of withholding an
amount of tax).  If the required documentation were not provided
or corrected by the expiration of the grace period, the payee
would be presumed to be a U.S. payee for purposes of section 3406
and chapter 61 of the Code from the date the account was first
credited.
     A special rule for joint owners or payees is provided in
paragraph (f)(2)(iii) that would permit a withholding agent to
presume that a payment made to joint owners or payees for whom it
does not hold the required documentation is made to U.S. payees. 
The grace period would apply to joint payees if each payee
qualified for its application.  If any one of them withdrew any
portion of the funds in the account, then additional withholding
under paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(A) would be required. 
     Paragraph (f)(2)(iv) addresses reportable payments to an
exempt recipient.  In that case, the withholding agent could
presume that the payee is a foreign person if it knew the payee's
TIN and the TIN began with the two digits "98."  The withholding
agent also could presume that the payee is a foreign person if
the payee had a foreign mailing address or the payment were made
outside of the United States (as defined in proposed 1.6049-
5(e)).  In other cases, the withholding agent could presume that
the exempt recipient is a U.S. person.  Thus, for example, a U.S.
withholding agent making a payment of interest on a registered
obligation to a corporation with an EIN beginning with the digits
"98" would not have to backup withhold under section 3406
(because the corporation is an exempt recipient).  However, it
should withhold a 30 percent tax under section 1442 because the
condition under 1.871-14(c)(1)(iii) that a certificate of
foreign status be received by the U.S. withholding agent for the
interest to qualify as portfolio interest would not be satisfied. 
Thus, the withholding agent should treat the interest as not
qualified for the portfolio interest exemption for purposes of
section 1441(b)(9).  Adjustments to the tax may be made at a
later time in accordance with proposed 1.1461-2 if the required
documentation described in proposed 1.871-14(c)(2) is later
furnished.  See proposed 1.871-14(c)(3) and 1.1441-1(f)(5) for
rules addressing late received documentation.  
     Paragraph (f)(3) contains special presumption provisions for
certain payments that are not subject to backup withholding:
scholarship and pension income.  In the case of scholarship and
grant income, the withholding agent or payor may generally treat
the payee as a U.S. person unless it has U.S. visa information in
its records concerning the payee.  For pension and annuities, the
payment would be presumed to be made to a U.S. person if the
payor had the payee's Social Security number and the payment were
made either to a U.S. mailing address or to a mailing address in
a foreign country with which the United States has an income tax
treaty in effect that exempts residents of the country from U.S.
tax on that income.  In all other cases, the payor could presume
that the payee is a foreign person.  A withholding agent may use
these presumptions as a safe harbor or may, at its option, choose
to withhold at a higher rate if it were unsure of the application
of the presumption in a particular case. 
     Paragraph (f)(4) provides special rules for pass-through
entities.  Paragraph (f)(4)(i) provides rules for determining
whether to treat a partnership as foreign or domestic.  The
withholding agent or payor could presume that the partnership is
a foreign partnership if the withholding agent or payor actually
knows that the partnership's EIN begins with the digits "98," if
the mailing address of the partnership is in a foreign country,
if the payment is made outside of the United States (as defined
in proposed 1.6049-5(e)), or if the withholding agent or payor
knows or had reason to know that the partnership is foreign.
     Under paragraph (f)(4)(ii), a withholding agent or payor
that makes a reportable payment to a person determined to be a
foreign partnership could presume that any partner for which it
does not hold the required documentation is a U.S. individual. 
In that case, the payee would be treated as a U.S. payee that is
not an exempt recipient and the payment would be subject to
reporting under chapter 61 of the Code and to backup withholding
under section 3406.  
     Paragraph (f)(4)(iii) provides rules for partners'
distributive shares.  A domestic partnership could treat a
partner as a U.S. payee if, at the time it is required to
withhold on a reportable payment, it did not hold all of the
required documentation for that partner.  A foreign partnership
that is a qualified intermediary under proposed 1.1441-
1(e)(5)(ii) could treat a partner as a foreign payee if, at the
time it were required to withhold on a reportable payment, it
could not associate the payment with the required documentation. 
      Paragraph (f)(5) clarifies that a withholding agent that
does not act in accordance with the presumptions and fails to
withhold the required amount may be liable under section 1461 or
3403 for the tax that should have been withheld based upon the
presumptions in paragraph (f), unless the withholding agent can
demonstrate either that the correct amount of tax was, in fact,
withheld or that the beneficial owner paid the tax due.  Proof of
payment of tax could be established on the basis of a Form 4669
furnished by the beneficial owner certifying the amount of tax
paid to the IRS.  Proof that the correct amount of tax was, in
fact, withheld, could be based upon obtaining the required
documentation.  Late-received documentation could be accepted as
proof of status and entitlement to a reduced rate of tax. 
However, if the delays involved in obtaining this documentation
affected its reliability, the IRS could require further proof of
status or entitlement to a reduced rate.  Further, pursuant to
section 1463 or section 3403, the withholding agent would be
liable for interest under section 6601, even though, ultimately,
there is no underlying tax liability.  Penalties may also apply.
     Under paragraph (f)(6), a reportable payment is an amount
reportable under section 3406(b) (without regard to any exception
to reporting under section 6041, 6041A, 6042, 6045, 6049, 6050A,
or 6050N).  
     Paragraph (f)(7) provides that if overwithholding occurs
under section 1441 as a result of application of the presumptions
in paragraph (f), adjustments may be made in accordance with
proposed 1.1461-2(a).  Appropriate refunds and credits may be
claimed under section 1464 or 6414.  Amounts overwithheld under
section 3406 are subject to adjustments pursuant to 31.6413(a)-
3(a)(1).
     Paragraph (g) provides that these rules are effective for
payments made after December 31, 1997.  However, transition rules
are provided so that valid certificates (as determined under
current rules) that are outstanding on the date that is 60 days
after these regulations are published as final regulations may
continue to be relied upon for their period of validity.  In
addition, dividends on publicly traded stocks are given special
transition relief.  See proposed 1.1441-6(b)(2).
1.1441-2  Income subject to withholding
     Paragraph (a) restates the rules in 1.1441-1 and -3(a) of
the existing regulations limiting withholding to items of income
from sources within the United States.  Paragraph (b) simplifies
1.1441-2(a) of the existing regulations by providing that, for
purposes of chapter 3 of the Code, fixed or determinable, annual
or periodical (FDAP) income is any income includable in income
under section 61, subject to enumerated exceptions in paragraph
(b)(2) (including certain exceptions for original issue discount
and capital gains, including option premiums).  Under these
proposed rules, income paid under a notional principal contract
would be FDAP, but see proposed 1.1441-4(a)(3) for an exemption
from withholding.
     Paragraph (b)(3) reflects the position adopted by the IRS in
TIR-877 (December 27, 1966) and in Rev. Rul. 68-333, 1968-1 C.B.
390 that FDAP includes original issue discount paid by an
original issuer of bonds or other obligations with original issue
discount.  However, under the authority of section 1441(c)(8),
only certain items of original issue discount are currently
subject to withholding of tax under Chapter 3.  The lack of rules
in this area in the past reflects the difficulties in determining
the amount of OID upon which withholding should be applied. 
These proposed regulations, however, identify transactions in
which information about the amount of original issue discount
would generally be known or available to the withholding agent. 
Therefore, the proposed regulations require withholding on
amounts paid upon sale by an obligor that is related to the
original issuer.  In addition, amounts that fail to qualify for
the portfolio interest exemption under section 871(h) or 881(c)
(because, for example, the statement described in section
871(h)(5) has not been furnished to the U.S. withholding agent)
would also be subject to withholding, regardless of whether it is
possible for the withholding agent to determine precisely the
amount of OID.  See proposed 1.871-14(c)(2).  If the required
documentation were not furnished, the amounts could be treated as
paid to a U.S. or foreign payee based upon the presumptions in
proposed 1.1441-1(f).  If the amounts are presumed paid to a
U.S. payee, backup withholding under section 3406 might apply. 
See 31.3406(b)(2)-(2).  If the amounts are presumed paid to a
foreign payee, withholding under section 1441 would apply (unless
the OID instrument had a maturity not exceeding 183 days from the
date of issue).   
     Under these rules, the entire amount of OID (as determined
on the date of issue) would have to be reported as taxable if the
exact amount of OID were not known.  Any amount of
overwithholding may be adjusted or refunded in accordance with
the procedures in proposed 1.1461-2(a) or 1.1464-1.
     The proposed changes to the OID rules would be effective for
OID on obligations issued after a date that is 60 days after
these regulations are published as final regulations.
     Paragraph (c) restates 1.1441-2(b) of the existing
regulations to eliminate the reference to pre-1967 payments.  It
also eliminates the reference to items of income under section
402(a)(2) and 403(a)(2), relating to payments from certain
employees trusts or under employee annuities, in order to conform
to the amendment made to sections 1441(b) and (c)(5) by Public
Law 102-318 that deleted these sections from the requirement of
withholding under section 1441.
     Paragraph (d) lists exemptions from withholding for certain
items that otherwise constitute FDAP income.  Paragraph (d)(1)
lists the exceptions that are not conditioned upon furnishing
documentation (e.g., interest on bearer or foreign targeted
registered obligations, short-term obligations).  However,
documentation may be required under the 1099 reporting provisions
in order to avoid reporting under sections 6041 or 6049 and
backup withholding under section 3406.  Paragraph (d)(2) lists
two other exceptions, but those exceptions are conditioned upon
furnishing documentation described in proposed 1.871-14(c)(2). 
The exceptions are portfolio interest on registered obligations
described in section 871(h)(2)(B) or 881(c)(2)(B) (other than
foreign targeted obligations) and bank deposit interest described
in section 871(i)(2)(A).  Because bank deposit interest is not
subject to beneficial owner documentation requirements under
current rules, the regulations propose a transition rule that
would allow interest paid on accounts in existence on or before a
date that is 60 days after these regulations are published as
final regulations to continue to be subject to current rules
until December 31, 1999.
     Paragraph (e) clarifies the meaning of payment for purposes
of withholding.  An amount would be considered paid when it is
includable in income under the cash basis method of accounting.
Under paragraph (e)(2), income reallocated under section 482 from
a U.S. person to a related foreign person would be considered a
payment for withholding tax purposes.  A payment would also be
considered to be made if income arose as a result of a secondary
adjustment made after income is allocated under section 482,
unless the taxpayer entered into a repatriation agreement that
eliminated the liability for withholding.  Paragraph (e)(3)
provides that income is not considered paid if it is blocked
under certain executive authority, but is considered paid on the
date the blocking restriction is removed and, therefore, subject
to withholding as of that date.  Paragraph (e)(4) provides
special payment rules for dividends.  These rules are similar to
those in effect for purposes of backup withholding.  See
31.3406(b)(2)-4.  Paragraph (e)(5) coordinates the payment
election for branch interest tax under 1.884-4(c)(1) with
section 6049 and the withholding provisions under section 1441.
1.1441-3  Amounts subject to withholding
     Paragraph (a) restates the rule in 1.1441-2(a)(1) of the
existing regulations that  withholding is generally imposed on
the gross amount of income.  Paragraph (b) provides for special
withholding rules for interest.  Paragraph (b)(1) restates the
rule in 1.1441-3(c)(3) of the existing regulations that requires
withholding on the entire amount of stated interest owed on an
interest-bearing obligation, regardless of the character of the
amounts paid.  The heading is modified to eliminate any inference
that this rule is limited to payments on defaulted interest
coupons.  Paragraph (b)(2) restates the exemption from
withholding in 1.1441-4(h) of the existing regulations regarding
sales of obligations between interest payment dates.  An anti-
abuse rule is added that would require withholding where the
withholding agent knew or had reason to know that the sale
transaction was part of a plan the principal purpose of which was
to avoid withholding through a pattern of sales and repurchases.
     Paragraph (c) provides rules relating to corporate
distributions and substantially relieves the withholding burden
imposed under 1.1441-3(b) of the existing regulations on these
distributions.  Under the proposed regulations, a corporation
could determine the amount of a distribution subject to
withholding based on a reasonable estimate of available earnings
and profits for the taxable year.  A corporation that made a
reasonable estimate, but nonetheless underwithheld, would remain
liable for the amount of tax underwithheld (and interest), but
not penalties.  These proposed regulations adopt the same
"reasonable estimate" standard as is provided under
31.3406(b)(2)-4(c)(2).  Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii), an
intermediary could rely on a reasonable estimate represented by
the distributing corporation.  The distributing corporation would
be made liable for any amount of underwithholding where the
withholding agent had relied on the representation and the
estimate had not been reasonably determined.
     Paragraph (c)(3) proposes special procedures for withholding
on certain distributions made by a Regulated Investment Company
(RIC).  In order to determine whether a withholding obligation
arises in that case, a RIC would benefit from the same exceptions
that would apply to other corporations for distributions payable
in stock or stock rights or distributions treated in part or in
full as in exchange for stock.  In addition, the proposed
regulations provide that no withholding is required for a
distribution that is a capital gain dividend defined in section
852(b)(3)(C) or an exempt interest dividend defined in section
852(b)(5)(A).  Special procedures are proposed for implementing
these exemptions, however, because a RIC must specifically
designate the extent to which a distribution falls under one of
these provisions.  Under applicable rules, the designation may be
made as late as 60 days after the close of the RIC's taxable
year, and after making the designation, the RIC may find that the
amount so designated exceeds what the Code and the regulations
allow.  This presents special difficulties under section 1441,
which assumes that the amounts subject to withholding are fixed
at the time they are paid.   
     To address these special difficulties, paragraph (c)(3)
would allow a RIC to designate interim distributions as being
subject to section 852(b)(3)(C) or 852(b)(5)(A).  If it later
determined that the designation was in excess of what was
permitted and, as a result, had underwithheld, the RIC would have
to satisfy the tax liability and could adjust the withholding
pursuant to proposed 1.1461-2(b).  A RIC would not be subject to
penalties for failure to withhold timely, provided the
designation was based upon a reasonable estimate when made. 
However, interest  would apply under section 6601.  In addition,
the RIC might be liable for penalties if the IRS determined that
the estimates were not reasonably determined.  
     Paragraph (d) restates, without significant changes, the
rule in 1.1441-3(d) of the existing regulations regarding
withholding on the full amount realized from the sale of property
where the withholding agent does not know the amount of gain
subject to withholding.  A withholding agent may, however,
determine gain based on the beneficial owner's withholding
certificate if it indicates the beneficial owner's basis in the
property sold.  This rule is of limited application as most
capital gains are exempt from withholding under section 1441.
     Paragraph (e) restates the rule in 1.1441-7(c) of the
existing regulations pertaining to payments in kind.  The
property conversion requirement under current rules would be made
optional.  Instead, the withholding agent could choose to obtain
payment from another source.  The regulations further propose to
clarify that the amount of a payment in kind is measured by the
fair market value of the property transferred or of the services
provided.  Payments made in foreign currency require a conversion
of the amount of  tax using the spot rate (as defined in 1.988-
1(d)(1)) or a reasonable spot rate convention.  Paragraph (e)(3)
provides guidance where the withholding agent's satisfaction of
the beneficial owner's tax liability constitutes additional
income to the beneficial owner that is subject to withholding. 
In that case, the final withholding tax liability would be
calculated under a gross-up formula.
     The provisions currently stated under 1.1441-3(j), relating
to conduit financing arrangements, are proposed to be
incorporated without change into a new paragraph (f).  These
provisions are not reproposed.
     The address rule in 1.1441-3(b)(3) of the existing
regulations would be eliminated and replaced by requirements to
furnish appropriate documentation or to establish foreign status
and, if applicable, residence in a treaty country.  See proposed
1.1441-1(e) and 1.1441-6.  Section 1.1441-3(c)(1) requiring
withholding in the case of interest paid on obligations issued by
the U.S. government would be deleted as unnecessary given the
provisions in 1.1441-2(a) describing income subject to
withholding.  Section 1.1441-3(c)(4) addressing unknown owners
would also be deleted because the presumption provisions in
1.1441-1(f) provide guidance.  The special rules for tax-free
covenant bonds issued prior to 1934 are proposed to be deleted. 
Comments are solicited as to whether these rules are still
necessary.
1.1441-4  Certain exemptions from withholding
     Paragraph (a)(1) restates, without significant change, the
provisions in 1.1441-4(a) of the existing regulations regarding
the exemption from withholding for certain income effectively
connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the
United States.  The regulations clarify that the exemption under
this section does not apply to claim an exemption under an income
tax treaty (i.e., income not attributable to a permanent
establishment).  Claims of treaty benefit must be made under the
procedures described in proposed 1.1441-6.  
     Under paragraph (a)(2)(i), a withholding agent could rely on
a claim that income is effectively connected with the conduct of
a trade or business within the United States if it held a
withholding certificate so stating.  The regulations do not
permit a withholding agent to rely on a qualified intermediary
withholding certificate to grant a reduced rate of withholding
for income claimed to be effectively connected, except in the
case of a qualified intermediary that is a partnership acting for
its own account.  A partnership that does not claim to be a
qualified intermediary could also furnish an intermediary
withholding certificate described in proposed 1.1441-
1(e)(3)(iii) (i.e., the transmittal certificate normally required
from a partnership transmitting its partners' documentation under
the procedures described in proposed 1.1441-5(b)).  For purposes
of claiming an effectively connected income exemption, it would
not be necessary to attach the partners' documentation to the
certificate since the exemption is available regardless of the
status of the partners and, under section 1446, the partnership
is required to withhold.  The validity period of a withholding
certificate used to claim an effectively connected exemption is
proposed to be extended from one year to three years (subject to
amendment if a change in circumstances affected the character of
the income that the beneficial owner anticipated would be
effectively connected).  This rule should significantly ease the
burden on continuing transactions that generate effectively
connected income every year.
     The regulations propose to eliminate the requirement that
the certificate be attached to the Form 1042-S; the withholding
agent would be required to state the beneficial owner's TIN on
the Form 1042-S.  See proposed 1.1461-1(c)(1)(i).  If the
withholding certificate were silent as to whether the income is
effectively connected or if the required documentation were
lacking, incorrect, or unreliable, the withholding agent should
presume that the income is not effectively connected.
     The rules provided in 1.1441-4(f) of the existing
regulations are proposed to be restated in a new paragraph
(a)(2)(ii) and are not reproposed.  Paragraph (a)(2)(iii)
provides for special rules for payments made to joint owners that
would require each joint owner to provide a withholding
certificate certifying that the income is effectively connected
with a trade or business in the United States.  These rules are
consistent with the joint owners rules provided under the section
3406 regulation.  See 31.3406(h)-2(a).
     Paragraph (a)(3) provides that no withholding is required on
income from notional principal contracts regardless of whether a
withholding certificate is provided.  However, such income would
have to be reported on a Form 1042 and 1042-S.  This rule would
significantly simplify the paper flows currently associated with
these transactions.
     Paragraph (a)(4) parallels the rule in proposed 1.1441-
1(f)(5) regarding the consequences of acting in a manner contrary
to prescribed presumptions.  Late received documentation could
relieve the withholding agent from the tax liability.  However,
an interest charge would apply under section 6601 on the amount
that should have been withheld even if, ultimately, there is no
underlying tax liability.  In addition, penalties might apply.
     Paragraph (b) of the existing regulations concerning
compensation for personal services of an individual is
substantially unchanged.  A new paragraph (b)(1)(ii) is added to
require that withholding on distributions from certain qualified
pension plans and annuities occur under section 1441 rather than
under section 3405 as was required under 1.1441-4T(b)(ii) (which
expired on February, 1993).  A new paragraph (b)(1)(vi) is also
added that would allow employers to wage withhold on compensation
that is otherwise exempt from wage withholding by reason of
section 3402(e).  This rule provides relief for employers of
nonresident alien individuals who derive income from sources
partly within and partly without the United States on a regular
basis (e.g., crew members working on cruise ships).  Without this
rule, employers would have to withhold at the 30 percent rate
instead of the lower wage withholding rate.  
     The provisions under paragraph (b)(2) of the existing
regulations (dealing with a claim of reduced rate of withholding
on personal service income under an income tax treaty) are
unchanged with one exception.  The 10-day review rule in
paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (iv) would be extended to 20 days.  This
extension is necessary because of the increase in the number of
Forms 8233 that the IRS receives.
     Paragraph (b)(6) is added to eliminate the requirement in
1.1441-3(e) of the existing regulations to pro-rate the personal
exemption based on the period during which a nonresident alien
individual is present in the United States during the taxable
year.  Therefore, the entire personal exemption amount could be
taken into account to determine the base amount on which to
withhold.  
     Paragraph (c) incorporates the provisions in 1.1441-2(c) of
the existing regulations dealing with participants in certain
exchange or training programs and provides additional guidance
with respect to payments of scholarship or fellowship grants to
nonresident alien individuals.  It reflects 1988 and 1994
statutory amendments to section 1441 concerning certain visa
holders.  Such income is subject to a lower withholding rate of
14 percent under section 871(c).  The regulations propose an
alternate withholding election so that taxpayers may choose to be
subject to the withholding rates applicable to wages, which in
many cases are likely to result in a lower rate.  Also,
individuals who receive both scholarship or grants and
compensation income from the same withholding agent could choose
to combine all income on Form 8233 to claim a reduced rate under
a tax treaty for both types of income.
     Paragraphs (d) (dealing with annuities) and (e) (dealing
with central banks of issue and the Bank of International
Settlement) merely reflect conforming changes regarding the
proposed documentation requirements.
1.1441-5  Withholding on payments to pass-through entities
     The existing regulations in 1.1441-5 address claims of U.S.
status.  These provisions are restated, with modifications, in
proposed 1.1441-1(d).
     This section, as revised, would provide special withholding
procedures for payments to partnerships.  Paragraph (a) deals
with domestic partnerships.  As under current regulations,
payments to domestic partnerships would not require withholding,
even if the partners were foreign persons.  A domestic
partnership is the withholding agent for items of income included
in the distributive share of a partner that is a foreign person. 
Paragraph (b) proposes to modify the current rules for payments
to foreign partnerships to permit a look-through approach, so
that claims of reduced rate could be presented by the partnership
on behalf of the partners (including partners that are U.S.
persons).  The look-through approach would apply through tiers of
foreign partnerships.  In the alternative, a foreign partnership
could, under an agreement with the IRS, become a qualified
intermediary so that the partners' documentation would not have
to be furnished to the withholding agent.  See proposed 1.1441-
1(e)(5) for rules applicable to qualified intermediaries. 
Paragraph (b)(2) clarifies how the look-through approach would
operate in the case of a tiered partnership.  Generally, the
partnership would have to look through tiers until it reached the
beneficial owner (as determined under proposed 1.1441-1(c)(6)). 
However, it could stop at any level in the chain that constitutes
a payee (as defined in proposed 1.1441-1(c)(3)).
1.1441-6  Claim of a reduced rate under an income tax treaty
      The proposed regulations eliminate the "address" rule in
1.1441-6(c)(1) of the existing regulations and in regulations
under several income tax treaties, which permits a withholding
agent to grant a reduced rate of tax under a treaty based upon
the address of the payee (including a nominee).  Paragraph (b)(1)
provides general procedures for reliance by a withholding agent
on a claim for a reduced rate of withholding under a treaty based
upon the documentation requirements described in proposed
1.1441-1(e)(1)(i).  A withholding agent could rely upon a
beneficial owner withholding certificate described in proposed
1.1441-1(e)(2) as establishing both foreign status and residence
in the treaty country provided a TIN is stated on the
certificate.  In addition, in the case of dividends with respect
to which an advance ruling is required in order to secure the
reduced rate of tax under the tax treaty, the withholding
certificate would have to state that the beneficial owner has
obtained such a ruling.  Such rulings are currently required
under a very limited number of tax treaties: Austria, Denmark,
Ireland, and Switzerland. See paragraph (e) regarding the
procedures for obtaining such a ruling.  Further, for amounts
exceeding $500,000 in the aggregate for the taxable year paid to
a beneficial owner related to the withholding agent, the
beneficial owner would have to indicate on the certificate that
it will file a Form 8833 under section 6114.  The regulations
under section 6114 are proposed to be modified accordingly. 
Claims of treaty benefit could also be made on the basis of an
intermediary withholding certificate described in proposed
1.1441-1(e)(3).  Further, a U.S. withholding agent could act
through an authorized foreign agent described in proposed
1.1441-7(c)(2).
     Paragraph (b)(2) provides special rules for certain
dividends paid on stock that is traded on a U.S. established
market.  For these dividends, the withholding agent could grant
treaty benefits based upon the same documentation procedures as
are proposed to apply to portfolio interest on registered
obligations (e.g., no TIN is required on a beneficial owner
withholding certificate).  See proposed 1.871-14(c)(2). 
Paragraph (b)(3) provides that the competent authorities may
agree to different certification procedures under an applicable
tax treaty.  
     Paragraph (b)(4) clarifies the manner in which beneficial
owners could claim benefits under a tax treaty where foreign law
principles apply to identify the beneficial owner of a payment
made to a foreign entity.  Under proposed 1.1441-1(c)(6)(ii)(B),
the beneficial owner would be determined based upon the laws of
the country whose tax treaty with the United States is invoked to
claim a reduced rate of tax.  
     These procedures are intended to apply in a reciprocal
manner.  Therefore, paragraph (b)(4)(iv) provides that, if the
IRS determined that a treaty partner is not identifying
beneficial owners in a similar manner and, as a result, denies
benefits under an otherwise applicable treaty to an entity
organized in the United States or to interest holders residing in
the United States, the benefits of these procedures could be
suspended for entities organized, or interest holders residing,
in that country until the competent authorities reached a
reciprocal agreement on the application of treaty benefits in
such cases.  Suspension of benefits under this provision would be
effective on a prospective basis only.
     Paragraph (c) states the rules regarding certification of a
TIN by the IRS.  These procedures would apply to payments for
which a Form W-8 is furnished with a TIN.  They are directed to
beneficial owners (or their agents) and are designed to ensure
that the IRS can verify the beneficial owner's status as a
resident of a treaty country based upon the information return
later filed by the withholding agent on Form 1042-S.  If the IRS
determined that the TIN does not support the beneficial owner's
claim of residence in the treaty country, it would so notify the
withholding agent. The IRS could waive the requirement that a
taxpayer certify its TIN with the IRS when it implements
procedures to verify a taxpayer's status directly with a foreign
competent authority.  The IRS could also certify a TIN based upon
representations made by a qualified intermediary.
     The IRS would certify a TIN based upon a certificate of
residence or documentary evidence.  Paragraph (c)(3) describes a
certificate of residence as a certificate issued by the tax
authorities of the treaty country certifying that the taxpayer
files income tax returns as a resident of that country and is
current on his filing obligations.  Paragraph (c)(4) describes
documentary evidence as a document that is no more than three-
years old and sufficiently identifies the person and the
residence of that person in the treaty country.
     Paragraph (e) incorporates the provisions in existing
regulations that condition the benefit of the reduced five-
percent rate on related party dividends to an advance ruling from
the IRS determining that the parent-subsidiary relationship is
not established or maintained with the principal purpose to
secure the reduced rate.  The ruling would be required only if so
required under an applicable treaty.  It must be requested prior
to the payment of the dividend.  While a request made after
payment would not disqualify the dividend from the benefit of the
reduced rate if a favorable ruling is later obtained, the
withholding agent would nevertheless withhold.  Failure to do so
would subject the withholding agent to an interest charge under
section 6601.  Also, the withholding agent would be liable for
the tax and related penalties if a favorable ruling were not
issued.  See proposed 1.1441-1(f)(5) regarding the consequences
to the withholding agent when it does not withhold the full
amount even though it does not hold the required documentation
prior to payment.
     The regulations are proposed to be effective for payments
made after December 31, 1997.  However, certificates issued on or
before the date that is 60 days after these regulations are
published as final regulations will continue to be valid until
they expire, based upon existing regulations.  In addition,
because no documentation is currently required for dividends, the
regulations propose a transition rule that would allow dividends
paid on publicly-traded stock to accounts in existence on or
before a date that is 60 days after these regulations are
published as final regulations to continue to be subject to the
current address rule until December 31, 1999.
1.1441-7  General provisions relating to withholding agents.
     This section modifies 1.1441-7 of the existing regulations
dealing with withholding agents.  Paragraph (a) clarifies that a
withholding agent is any person that has the control, receipt,
custody, disposal, or payment of an item of income and not merely
a person that pays or causes an amount to be paid.  If there are
several withholding agents with respect to one payment, only one
tax should be withheld and only one return should be filed.
     Paragraph (b) restates the "actual knowledge or reason to
know" standards applicable to a withholding agent as in effect
under current law.  The IRS and Treasury are aware that the
application of a "reason to know" standard without limitation may
be impractical in the case of financial institutions handling
large volumes of transactions for many customers.  Therefore, the
regulations propose to limit the due diligence expected from
withholding agents paying portfolio interest, deposit interest,
or dividends on publicly traded stock.  Under paragraph
(b)(2)(ii), a withholding agent's due diligence regarding a
beneficial owner certificate would be limited to examining the
address stated on the certificate.  If this information indicated
that the beneficial owner might be a U.S. taxpayer or conflicted
with information that the withholding agent otherwise had in its
records for that account, the withholding agent would have to
obtain specified documentation to verify the beneficial owner's
claim of foreign status or residence.  Paragraph (b)(3) proposes
to incorporate rules consistent with those under section 3406
dealing with universal accounts.  Therefore, if the withholding
agent used a system of universal accounts, it would be required
to use that system to determine the scope of its due diligence
under the regulations. 
     Paragraph (c) restates and expands the provisions in
1.1441-7(b) of the existing regulations pertaining to authorized
agents and adds provisions regarding an authorized foreign agent. 
This new concept is intended to facilitate compliance by U.S.
withholding agents that make payments through their agent abroad. 
By imputing the acts of a foreign agent to a U.S. withholding
agent, the required documentation could remain with the foreign
agent and would not have to be provided to the U.S. withholding
agent.  However, the regulations require that the agent be
"authorized" in order to insure that the IRS can verify the
foreign agent's compliance with the withholding procedures,
which, in turn, would determine whether the U.S. withholding
agent has itself complied.  See proposed 1.1461-1(b)(2)(iii) and
(c)(4)(iii) regarding corresponding filing requirements.  
     Section 1.1441-7(b)(3) of the existing regulations is
proposed to be deleted, pending comments on the continuing
necessity of providing guidance on tax-free covenant bonds.  
     Paragraph (d) restates without changes the provisions in
1.1441-7(a)(2) of the existing regulations dealing with the
United States as a withholding agent.  Paragraph (e) restates
without changes the provisions in 1.1441-3(c)(2) of the existing
regulations dealing with assumed obligations.  Section 1.1441-
7(c) of existing regulations dealing with payments other than
money would be deleted and restated in proposed 1.1441-3(f)
dealing with withholding procedures for payments in kind.
1.1441-8T  Foreign government and international organization
exemption from withholding
     This section exempts from withholding certain types of
income excluded from gross income under section 892 that are paid
to foreign governments and international organizations. 
Revisions are proposed to paragraph (b) of the existing
regulations to conform the certification procedures to the
proposed withholding certificate procedures described in proposed
1.1441-1(e)(1)(i).  Therefore, Form 8709 would be replaced by
the standard withholding certificate (Form W-8), meaning that
foreign governments and international organizations would be
relieved from the requirement to furnish annual certification.  A
foreign government or an international organization would not be
required to furnish a tax identifying number.  However, if it
did, the certificate would be valid indefinitely for income
required to be reported on Form 1042 or for which the withholding
agent reports the TIN to the IRS.  See proposed 1.1441-
1(e)(4)(ii).
1.1441-9  Exemption from withholding on exempt income of foreign
tax-exempt corporations and foreign private foundations
     This new section provides that income paid to a foreign
organization described in section 501(c) would not be subject to
withholding under section 1442 if the income were not subject to
tax as unrelated business income under section 511 and the entity
were exempt from tax under section 501(a).  For purposes of
granting a reduced rate, a withholding agent could rely on a
withholding certificate satisfying the requirements of proposed
1.1441-1(e)(1).  A beneficial owner certificate must include a
taxpayer identifying number and must certify that it will not be
subject to tax under section 511, and that the IRS has issued a
determination letter.  In the absence of such a letter, the
beneficial owner should provide an opinion of counsel stating
that the organization meets the conditions for a tax exemption
under section 501(c).  Since the affidavit requirement for
foreign foundations is proposed to be eliminated, foreign tax-
exempt organizations would be subject to the same documentation
requirements as would apply to foreign foundations under proposed
1.1443-1(b). 
1.1461-1  Deposit and return of tax withheld
     The provisions in 1.1461-1 of the existing regulations
pertaining to ownership certificates for bond interest are
proposed to be deleted.  Interest on bonds described in this
section would be subject to the regular procedures provided in
the regulations under sections 1441 and 1443.  The special rules
would no longer be necessary in view of the substitute procedures
provided in the proposed regulations.  Comments are solicited as
to the continuing need for provisions governing tax-free covenant
bonds.
     Section 1.1461-1 contains proposed procedures for
withholding agents to pay the withheld tax and file the annual
income tax return and information returns with respect to
payments of income subject to section 1441 withholding. 
Paragraph (a) restates 1.1461-3 of the existing regulations
regarding the payment of amounts withheld.  The provisions
regarding pre-1973 years are proposed to be deleted as obsolete. 
Paragraph (b) revises 1.1461-2(b) of the existing regulations on
the filing of returns of amounts withheld.  Paragraph (b)(1)
clarifies that the Form 1042 must include the total amount of
income paid during the preceding calendar year.  Also, the filing
date is changed from March 15 to February 28 in order to conform
with the filing dates for Form 1099.  The proposed regulations
would eliminate the requirement to attach the Forms 1042-S to the
return.  Instead, the Forms 1042-S would have to be filed
separately with a transmittal form.  See paragraph (c)(1)(i).  
     Paragraph (b)(2) describes applicable return requirements
for multiple withholding agents.  Generally, as under current
rules, only one Form 1042 would have to be filed for an item of
income.  Exceptions to this general rule are provided for
payments to qualified intermediaries where the U.S. withholding
agent would have to file a return, regardless of whether the
qualified intermediary assumed primary withholding responsibility
for the payment and regardless of whether the qualified
intermediary were also required to file a return under its
agreement with the IRS.  Another exception would be provided for
payments to an authorized foreign agent.  In that case, the U.S.
withholding agent and the authorized foreign agent would each be
required to make a return.  The return of the withholding agent
would report amounts paid to the authorized foreign agent.  The
return of the authorized foreign agent would report amounts paid
to the beneficial owner or its intermediaries.
     Paragraph (b)(3) requires that changes to the originally
filed Form 1042 be filed on an amended return on a new Form
1042X.  This change is designed to facilitate the processing of
returns by the IRS and would be consistent with the procedures
for filing other amended returns.  
     Paragraph (c) revises the provisions in 1.1461-2(c) of the
existing regulations regarding the filing of information returns
on Form 1042-S.  As under existing regulations, any income
subject to withholding must be reported on an information return
on Form 1042-S and a return would be due irrespective of the fact
that no tax was withheld (e.g., the beneficial owner claimed an
exemption or the withholding agent failed to withhold).  
     The provisions of 1.1461-2(c)(3) of the existing
regulations requiring that the name of the beneficial owner be
reported on Form 1042-S would be retained.  However, more
detailed guidance is provided regarding reporting of income paid
to intermediaries.  See paragraph (c)(4) below dealing with
multiple agents.  The proposed regulations eliminate as
unnecessary the requirements under existing regulations to attach
any certificate, form, or statement to the return.
     Paragraph (c)(1)(ii) proposes new rules pertaining to joint
owners.  A single Form 1042-S may be provided to one of the joint
owners.  In that case, the withholding agent should provide the
Form 1042-S to the joint owner whose status determines the tax
withheld.  Further, any one owner may request a separate Form
1042-S, but the total amounts of income and tax reported paid and
withheld on all the forms 1042-S may not exceed the total amount
of income actually paid and tax actually withheld.
     Paragraph (c)(2) replaces 1.1461-2(c)(1) of the existing
regulations and states that the items of income that are subject
to reporting on Form 1042-S are those items of income subject to
withholding, income from a notional principal contract, and
amounts described in sections 6041 through 6050P that are paid to
a foreign person and are not exempt from reporting under those
sections or the corresponding regulations.  This provision is
intended to standardize reports of payments to foreign persons to
the IRS and should simplify compliance by withholding agents. 
Paragraph (c)(2)(ii) lists the exceptions to reporting on a Form
1042-S.  As under current regulations, items of income exempt
from reporting include portfolio interest on a bearer obligation
and original issue discount on short-term obligations.  An
explicit exception for reporting on deposits described in section
871(i)(2)(A) would be added. However, bank deposit interest that
is subject to withholding under section 1441 (because, for
example, documentation was not furnished but payments were made
to a foreign address; see special grace period provisions under
proposed 1.1441-1(f)(2)(i)(B)) would have to be reported.  Also,
interest on bank deposit interest paid to Canadian residents
would have to be reported based upon provisions under final
regulations under section 6049 published in the Rules and
Regulations section of this issue of the Federal Register.  In
addition to the items excepted from reporting under existing
1.1461-1(c)(1), other items are added that prevent duplicative
reporting.   Finally, the proposed regulations would clarify that
to the extent group-term life insurance and other items of income
required to be reported pursuant to the provisions in 1.6041-2
and 1.6052-1 can be associated with wages required to be reported
on a Form W-2, then such items may also be reported on a Form W-2
instead of a Form 1042-S.
     Paragraph (c)(3) restates the provisions of 1.1461-2(c)(2)
of the existing regulations regarding the types of information to
be included on Form 1042-S.  It clarifies that the information
could be based on the information furnished by or on behalf of
the beneficial owner, as corrected based on the withholding
agent's actual knowledge if necessary.  In addition, the Form
1042-S would have to include the TIN of the beneficial owner if
required to be shown on the withholding certificate.   Also, a
beneficial owner's TIN that the beneficial owner is not required
to furnish but which is actually known to the withholding agent
would have to be reported on Form 1042-S.  
     Paragraph (c)(4) is added to provide rules for filing Form
1042-S where there are multiple withholding agents.  Generally,
as with the Form 1042, only one Form 1042-S must be filed with
respect to an item of income.  Current rules requiring the
withholding agent to identify the beneficial owners of payments
made to agents, nominees, or representatives, if known, would be
eliminated for payments to an intermediary that either claims to
be a qualified intermediary or is an authorized foreign agent. 
In all other cases, the information on a Form 1042-S must be
reported for each beneficial owner.  This would modify 1.1461-
2(c)(3)(i) of the existing regulations providing that beneficial
owner information be reported only if known.  For payments made
to a person claiming to be a qualified intermediary or is an
authorized foreign agent, each withholding agent in the chain
would be permitted to report on one Form 1042-S reflecting the
payment made to the next qualified intermediary or authorized
foreign agent in the chain.  In the case of a payment to an
authorized foreign agent, however, the withholding agent would be
excused from the requirement to report the beneficial owner
information only to the extent that the authorized foreign agent
actually complies with the filing requirements under paragraph
(c)(4)(iv).  
     Paragraph (c)(5) is added to cross-reference the magnetic
media filing requirements applicable to Forms 1042-S under
1.6011-1(c).  Generally, a filer of 250 or more Forms 1042-S
must file on magnetic media, unless a waiver is granted.
     Paragraph (d) would allow a withholding agent to provide a
list of taxpayer identifying numbers furnished by or on behalf of
beneficial owners to the extent the agent has relied upon such
number to grant a reduced rate of withholding tax.  This is a
special filing procedure under which the reporting of the
associated amount of income would not be have to be reported.
     Finally, paragraph (e) clarifies the provisions regarding
indemnification of withholding agents.  Section 1461 indemnifies
a withholding agent from the claim of any person for the amount
of any payments made in accordance with the provisions of chapter
3 of the Code.  Some commentators and withholding agents have
expressed concerns that section 1461 could be interpreted to
limit indemnification to amounts that were required to be
withheld.  The proposed regulations clarify that a withholding
agent that withheld based upon a reasonable belief that such
amount was withheld in accordance with chapter 3 of the Code
would be treated for purposes of section 1461 as having withheld
in accordance with chapter 3 (even though it is later determined
that the withholding agent's application of the rules was
incorrect).  Additionally, a withholding agent would be
indemnified against any claim of any person for the amount of any
withholding made in accordance with the grace period provisions
under proposed 1.1441-1(f)(2)(ii). 
     Paragraph (f) restates without changes 1.1461-2(f) of the
existing regulations dealing with amounts that may not constitute
gross income, in whole or in part.  This rule would  apply to
amounts subject to withholding under proposed 1.1441-3(b)(1) or
1.1441-3(d).
     Paragraph (g) is added to provide guidance on requests of
extensions of time to file Form 1042, Forms 1042-S, and to
furnish Forms 1042-S to recipients.  The rules with respect to
such requests would parallel those under section 6081.  A change
would be made, however, to the form to be used for making a
request for an extension of time to file Forms 1042-S. 
Currently, these requests are made on Form 2758; the proposed
regulations require such a request to be made on Form 8809.
1.1461-2  Adjustments for overwithholding and underwithholding
of tax
     This section has also been renumbered and, although the
rules are the same as those of the current regulations in
1.1461-4, it has been redrafted to simplify the language and to
update the examples.  Specifically, the rule for reimbursements
remains the same, but the rule in proposed 1.1461-4(b) with
respect to the adjustment of tax payments or deposits is now
titled "set-offs," which more accurately describes the adjustment
process.
1.1462-1  Withheld tax as credit to recipient of income
     Section 1.1462-1(a) is clarified by stating that the amount
of income from which the tax is required to be withheld includes
the amount calculated under the gross-up formula in proposed
1.1441-3(e)(3).

1.1463-1  Tax paid by recipient of income 
     This section provides that if the income tax for which the
beneficial owner and the withholding agent have joint liability
under section 1461 has been paid by either one of them, the IRS
may not collect from the other, regardless of the original
liability for the tax.  This section has been changed to reflect
the 1989 statutory amendment (Public Law 101, 239, Sec. 7743(a))
that provides for the imposition of interest and penalties on the
party that fails to withhold. 
Prior proposed regulations under section 871 and chapter 3 of the
Code
     In 1976, proposed regulations were published relating
primarily to withholding and original issue discount.  In 1984,
proposed regulations were published relating primarily to claims
of benefits under income tax treaties.  These proposed
regulations were contained in project number LR-2043, published
on July 12, 1976 (41 FR 28517) and project number LR-271-83,
published on September 10, 1984 (49 FR 35511).  Both proposed
regulations are being withdrawn on April 22, 1996.
Regulations under sections 6041, 6041A, 6042, 6045, 6049, and
6050N
     These proposed regulations provide exceptions from
information reporting and backup withholding under sections 3406,
6041, 6041A, 6042, 6045, 6049, and 6050N for payments to foreign
beneficial owners and for income paid by certain foreign payors
or middlemen.
     Generally the regulations clarify and simplify the
regulations under sections 3406, 6041, 6042, 6045, and 6049 that
were proposed on February 29, 1988, at 53 FR 5991 (1988) (the
1988 proposed regulations).  In addition, the regulations under
these sections are proposed to be revised.  The regulations also
would add new exceptions from reporting (including the addition
of middleman rules) to sections 6041, 6041A, and 6050N.  These
proposed revisions and new exceptions from reporting parallel the
exceptions under these proposed regulations under sections 6042
and 6049.  Further, parallel provisions are found in each section
for: definitions of terms (such as non-U.S. payor or non-U.S.
middleman); presumptions as to whether a payee is U.S. or foreign
where the required documentation is lacking, incorrect, or
unreliable; rules for payments to joint owners; and rules for
converting into U.S. dollars amounts paid in foreign currency.  
In addition, the proposed regulations specify that the standard
of knowledge applicable to payors and middlemen would be actual
knowledge.  Thus, the "reason to know" standard would not apply
for purposes of the reporting provisions.
     The subparagraphs under proposed 1.6042-3(a) (dealing with
the definition of dividends for purposes of information reporting
under that section) are proposed to be restated with changes in
drafting only.  The substantive rules in that paragraph would be
unchanged and are, therefore, not reproposed.  Also,  1.6042-
3(b)(3) and (4) of the 1988 proposed regulations (relating to
capital gain dividends from regulated investment companies and
payments to exempt recipients) would be redesignated as
subparagraphs (vii) and (viii), respectively, of proposed
1.6042-3(b)(1).  These rules are not reproposed.
     This document also proposes to revise the definition of an
exempt recipient in the case of a corporation.  Section 1.6049-
4(c)(1)(ii)(A) of the 1988 proposed regulations provides that a
person would be treated as a corporation, and therefore as an
exempt recipient not subject to information reporting, if the
name of the payee or a corporate resolution provided to the payor
clearly indicates corporate status (the eyeball test).  These
proposed regulations retain the eyeball test of the 1988 proposed
regulations for payments (i) other than interest, dividends and
broker proceeds paid to accounts established after a date that is
60 days after the date that these regulations are published as
final regulations in the Federal Register and (2) other than
interest, dividends and broker proceeds that are not paid to a
person to whom the payor has an account relationship.  For
interest and dividends paid to a new account, the entity would be
required to provide either a corporate resolution or similar
document that clearly indicates corporate status, a Form W-9 with
an EIN, or a Form W-8. For interest and dividends paid where an
account relationship does not exist, the payor may continue to
rely on the eyeball test if the payor also has a mailing address
of the payee in the United States.  The IRS and Treasury
understand that financial institutions routinely request a
corporate resolution when opening accounts for entities. 
Therefore, requiring such a document would not significantly
increase burden and would improve compliance.  This proposed rule
is reflected in paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A).  In addition, the list
of international organizations under paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(G) is
proposed to be eliminated as a simplification measure.  
     In addition, the 1988 proposed regulations under 1.6049-5
are proposed to be substantially redrafted, although without
significant substantive changes. Paragraph (b)(6) provides an
exception from reporting for amounts from sources outside the
United States paid outside the United States by a non-U.S. payor
or non-U.S. middleman.  This provision duplicates that found in
the 1988 proposed regulations at proposed 1.6049-5(b)(8) and
1.6049-5(d)(3)(i), (ii), and the foreign source portion of
proposed 1.6049-5(d)(3)(iii). 
     Paragraph (b)(7) (which corresponds to 1.6049-5(c)(6) of
the 1988 proposed regulations) would except portfolio interest
paid on bearer obligations if paid outside the United States.  In
these proposed regulations, this exception would not apply where
a U.S. middleman acts as a custodian, nominee, or other agent of
the payee and collects the amount for, or on behalf of, the
payee, whether or not the middleman is also acting as agent of
the payor.  Paragraph (b)(8) (which corresponds to 1.6049-
5(c)(6) of the 1988 proposed regulations) provides an exception
for portfolio interest paid on registered obligations.
     The provisions of 1.6049-5(b)(9) of the 1988 proposed
regulations, which excepted from reporting amounts paid by an
international organization (or its agent) on an obligation issued
by the international organization are proposed to be incorporated
in paragraph (b)(9) of these new proposed regulations.  These
rules are not reproposed.
     Paragraph (b)(10) (which corresponds to 1.6049-5(c)(5)(ii)
of the 1988 proposed regulations) provides an exception for
certain short-term foreign targeted obligations.  Paragraph
(b)(11) (which corresponds to 1.6049-5(e)(1) (the parenthetical
language) and 1.6049-5(e)(2)(i) and (ii) of the proposed 1988
proposed regulations) provides an exception for certain foreign-
targeted obligations issued by persons engaged in the banking
business.   Although the 1988 proposed regulations limited the
exceptions at 1.6049-5(e)(2)(i) and (ii) to Canadians, these
proposed regulations expand the scope of the exceptions to apply
to all beneficial owners.  However, as under the 1988 proposed
regulations, the exception would not apply where a U.S. middleman
acts as an agent of the payee.
     Paragraph (b)(12) (which corresponds to 1.6049-5(b)(7) and
(c)(1), (2), and (3) of the 1988 proposed regulations) would
except any amount of U.S. source interest subject to withholding
under section 1441.  Such interest would be required to be
reported on a Form 1042-S under proposed 1.1461-1(c).  This
exception would replace 1.6049-5(b)(1)(vi), (b)(1)(vi)(B)(1) and
(b)(2)(iv) of the existing regulations, which provide an
exception for reporting for bank deposit interest paid to a
foreign person, but only if a Form W-8 (or documentary evidence
in appropriate cases) is provided to the payor.  The withholding
certificate requirement for bank deposit interest is now found at
proposed 1.1441-2(d)(2).
     Paragraph (b)(13) provides a new exception for assets
blocked pursuant to an executive order.
     Paragraph (b)(14) provides the general rule for exempting
any other amount of otherwise reportable interest based on
specified documentation furnished to the payor or middleman.  The
standards of documentation are described in paragraph (c) and
would generally parallel the documentation standards proposed for
purposes of claiming a reduced rate of withholding under section
1441.  Therefore, the payor could rely on a beneficial owner or
intermediary withholding certificate described in proposed
1.1441-1(e)(1)(i) provided it complied with the procedures
described in proposed 1.1441-1(e)(4)(iv) and (v) (dealing with
on-line confirmation and notification procedures).  No taxpayer
identifying number is required to be stated on a beneficial owner
withholding certificate.  These proposed regulations retain the
permission under current regulations to furnish documentary
evidence instead of a certificate for payments made to an off-
shore account.  The on-shore and off-shore distinction is similar
to that found in the 1988 proposed regulations.  The provisions
of the 1988 proposed regulations contained in paragraphs (d),
(e), (f), (g), (h), (i), and (l) are withdrawn.  Proposed
paragraphs (j) (relating to payments outside the United States)
and (k) (dealing with original issue discount) of the 1988
proposed regulations would be renumbered as paragraphs (e) and
(f), respectively.  The provisions in these paragraphs are not
restated.
31.3401(a)(6)-1(e)  Income exempt from income tax
     This section is amended to reflect the new certification
procedures under proposed 1.1441-1(e).
Backup withholding regulations under section 3406
     Several changes to the backup withholding regulations under
section 3406 are proposed to conform those regulations to the
proposed information reporting and chapter 3 withholding
regulations.  Section 31.3406(d)-3 (c) would be amended to extend
to 90 days the current 30-day grace period applicable to readily
tradeable instruments acquired directly from a payor if the
payment were made to a person for whom indicia of foreign status
existed, as described in proposed 1.1441-1(f)(2)(i)(B).  
     Section 31.3406(g)-1(e) would revise the proposed
regulations contained in project number IA-224-82 published in
the Federal Register on September 27, 1990 (55 FR 39427) to
restate the principles that no backup withholding applies under
section 3406 to reportable payments made outside the United
States even though documentary evidence of non-U.S. status may be
required in order to exempt the payment from 1099 reporting,
unless the payor has actual knowledge that the payee is a United
States person.  The regulations propose to add an exception for
notional principal contract payments that are made outside the
United States.
Amendments to 31.6413(a)-3
     The regulations under 31.6413(a)-3 are proposed to be
amended in order to allow payers to refund backup withholding in
certain circumstances.  Those regulations currently prohibit a
refund of backup withholding except when erroneous withholding
has occurred.  It is proposed to expand the definition of
erroneous withholding to a situation where the withholding agent
backup withholds because the payee fails to provide sufficient
documentation as required under section 3406 and 1441 and the
regulations under these sections.  Where an appropriate
withholding certificate is later provided, the withholding agent
could treat the earlier withholding as erroneous withholding. 
However, the withholding certificate should to be received prior
to the end of the calendar year in which the payment is made and
prior to the time the payor furnishes a Form 1099 to the payee
with respect to the payment for which the withholding erroneously
occurred.  The amount refunded would be the amount actually
withheld less the amount required to be withheld, if any, under
chapter 3 of the Code. 
Removal of Q&A regulations
     The existing regulations under part 35a are proposed to be
removed in order to reflect the proposed revisions in this
document.
Amendments to 301.6109-1
     Amendments to the regulations under this section are
currently pending to authorize the IRS to issue taxpayer
identifying numbers to certain foreign persons and to require a
taxpayer to state a TIN on any tax return filed (other than an
information return).  These regulations are proposed to be
further amended to require that a TIN be stated on withholding
certificates as may be required under the regulations proposed
under sections 1441, 1442, and 1443.
Amendments to 301.6114-1
     The regulations under section 6114 are proposed to be
amended to require certain foreign entities to file a Form 8833
if they are claiming to be qualified under a limitation of
benefits provision under an income tax treaty, even though the
income is also reported on a Form 1042 by the withholding agent. 
The filing requirement would be limited to payments between
related parties that exceed $500,000 for the taxable year.  See
proposed 1.1441-6(b)(1).
Amendments to 301.6402-3(e)
     Paragraph (e) of the regulations under 301.6402-3 is
proposed to be amended to require that returns filed to claim a
refund of tax include the taxpayer's TIN.  In addition, the Form
1042-S would have to be attached to the return and also show the
taxpayer's TIN.
Removal of Certain Regulations Under Tax Conventions
     This document proposes to remove certain regulations issued
under income tax conventions between the United States and
Greece, Germany, Switzerland, Ireland, France, Austria, Pakistan,
Sweden and Denmark.  Removal of these regulations will be done in
consultation with the competent authorities of these countries.
Special Analyses
     It has been determined that this notice of proposed
rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action as defined in
EO 12866.  Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. 
It has also been determined that section 553(b) of the
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the
Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to
these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility
Analysis is not required.  Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the
Internal Revenue Code, these regulations will be submitted to the
Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration
for comment on their impact on small business.
Comments and Requests for a Public Hearing
     Before these proposed regulations are adopted as final
regulations, consideration will be given to any written comments
(a signed original and eight (8) copies) that are submitted
timely to the IRS.  All comments will be available for public
inspection and copying.  A public hearing will be scheduled on a
date, time, and place as will be published in the Federal
Register.

Proposed Amendment to the Regulations
     Accordingly, under the authority of 26 U.S.C. 7805, 26 CFR
chapter I is proposed to be amended as follows:
PART 1--INCOME TAXES
     Paragraph 1.  The authority citation for part 1 is amended
by adding entries  in numerical order and removing the entry for
1.1441-4T to read as follows:
     Authority:  26 U.S.C. 7805  * * *
     Section 1.1441-2 also issued under 26 U.S.C. 1441(c)(4) and
26 U.S.C. 3401(a)(6).

     Section 1.1441-7 also issued under 26 U.S.C. 1441(c)(4) and
26 U.S.C. 3401(a)(6).  * * *
1.163-5  [Amended]
     Par. 2.  In 1.163-5 paragraph (c)(2)(i)(B)(5) is amended by
removing the language "subdivision (iii) of A-5 of 35a.9999-4T"
in the last sentence and adding "1.6049-5(c)(2)(ii)" in its
place.
     Par. 3.  Section 1.165-12(c) is amended by:
     1.  Removing paragraph (c)(1)(iii).
     2.  Redesignating paragraphs (c)(1)(iv) and (c)(1)(v) as
paragraphs (c)(1)(iii) and (c)(1)(iv), respectively.
     3.  Amending paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(ii) by removing
the language "(c)(1)(v)" and adding "(c)(1)(iv)" in its place.  
     4.  Revising newly designated paragraph (c)(1)(iii).
     The revision reads as follows:
1.165-12  Denial of deduction for losses on registration-
required obligations not in registered form.
* * * * *
     (c)  * * *
     (1)  * * *
     (iii)  The holder may deliver an obligation in bearer form
that is offered or sold inside the United States only if the
holder delivers it to a financial institution that is purchasing
for its own account, the account of another foreign institution,
or an exempt organization that will comply with the requirements
of section 165(j)(3)(A), (B), or (C).  The holder may deliver a
registration-required obligation in bearer form that is offered
and sold outside the United States to a person other than a
financial institution only if the holder has evidence in its
records that such person is not a U.S. citizen or resident and
does not have actual knowledge that such evidence is false.  Such
evidence may include a statement by that person that is delivered 
electronically.  For purposes of this paragraph (c), the term
deliver includes a transfer of an obligation evidenced by a book
entry including a book entry notation by a clearing organization
evidencing transfer of the obligation from one member of the
organization to another member.  For purposes of this paragraph
(c), the term deliver does not include a transfer of an
obligation to the issuer or its agent for cancellation or
extinguishment.
* * * * *
     Par. 4.  Section 1.871-14 is added to read as follows:
1.871-14   Rules relating to repeal of tax on interest of
nonresident alien individuals and foreign corporations received
from certain portfolio debt investments.
     (a)  General rule.  No tax shall be imposed under sections
871(a)(1)(A), 871(a)(1)(C), 881(a)(1) or 881(a)(3) on any
portfolio interest as defined in sections 871(h)(2) and 881(c)(2)
received by a foreign person.  But see section 871(h) or 882(a)
if such interest is effectively connected with the conduct of a
trade or business within the United States. 
     (b)  Rules concerning obligations not in registered form--
(1)  In general.  [Reserved] For further guidance, see 35a.9999-
5(a), Answer 1. 
     (2)  Convertible obligations.  [Reserved] For further
guidance, see 35a.9999-5(c), Answers 18 and 19. 
     (3)  Coordination with withholding and reporting rules.  See
1.1441-2(d)(1)(i) for an exception from documentation
requirements otherwise applicable for purposes of section 1441. 
See section 6049 and 1.6049-5(b)(7) for rules relating to an
exemption from Form 1099 reporting and backup withholding under
section 3406. 
     (c)  Rules concerning obligations in registered form--(1) 
In general.  In the case of interest paid on an obligation that
is in registered form, the term portfolio interest means any
interest (including original issue discount)--
     (i)  That is paid on an obligation issued after July 18,
1984;
     (ii)  That would be subject to tax under section
871(a)(1)(A), 871(a)(1)(C), 881(a)(1) or 881(a)(3) but for
section 871(h) or 881(c); and 
     (iii)  With respect to which a United States (U.S.) person
otherwise required to deduct and withhold tax under section
1441(a) or 1442(a) receives a statement that meets the
requirements of section 871(h)(5) that the beneficial owner of
the obligation is not a U.S. person.
     (2)  Required statement.  A U.S. person will be considered
to have received a statement that meets the requirements of
section 871(h)(5) if either it complies with one of the
procedures described in this paragraph and does not have actual
knowledge or reason to know that the beneficial owner is a U.S.
person or it complies with the procedures described in paragraph
(d) or (e) of this section.
     (i)  The U.S. person (or its authorized foreign agent
described in 1.1441-7(c)(2)) complies with the withholding
certificate procedures described in 1.1441-1(e)(1).
     (ii)  The U.S. person complies with the documentary evidence 
procedures described in 1.6049-5(c)(2)(ii) (but only if payments
are made outside the United States with respect to offshore
accounts).  See 1.6049-5(e) for determining the place of payment
and 1.6049-5(d)(3) for a definition of offshore accounts.
     (iii)  [Reserved] For further guidance, see 35a.9999-5(b),
Answer 9, sentences 5 through 13. 
     (iv)  The U.S. person complies with procedures that the U.S.
competent authority may agree to with the competent authority of
a country with which the United States has an income tax treaty
in effect.
     (3)  Time for providing certificate or documentary evidence. 
Interest on a registered obligation shall qualify as portfolio
interest if the withholding certificate or documentary evidence
that must be provided is furnished before expiration of the
beneficial owner's period of limitation for claiming a refund of
tax with respect to such interest.  See, however, 1.1441-1(f)(5)
for consequences to a withholding agent that makes a payment
without withholding even though it cannot associate the payment
with the required documentation prior to the payment.
     (4)  Coordination with withholding and reporting rules.  For
an exemption from withholding under section 1441 with respect to
obligations described in this paragraph (c), see 1.1441-2(d)(2). 
For rules applicable to withholding certificates, see 1.1441-
1(e)(4).  For application of presumptions when the U.S. person
cannot associate the payment with the required documentation, see
1.1441-1(f).  For standards of knowledge applicable to
withholding agents, see 1.1441-7(b).  For rules relating to an
exemption from Form 1099 reporting and backup withholding under
section 3406, see section 6049 and 1.6049-5(b)(8).  For rules
relating to reporting on Forms 1042 and 1042-S, see 1.1461-1(b)
and (c).
     (d)  Application of repeal of 30 percent withholding to
pass-through certificates.  [Reserved]  For further guidance, see
35a.9999-5(e), Answers 21 and 22.
     (e)  Foreign-targeted registered obligations. [Reserved] 
For further guidance, see 35a.9999-5(b), Answers 12 through 15. 
     (f)  Definitions.  For purposes of this section, the terms
foreign person and beneficial owner have the meaning set forth in
1.1441-1(c)(2) and (c)(6), respectively; the term withholding
agent has the meaning set forth in 1.1441-7(a); and the term
payment has the meaning set forth in 1.1441-2(e).
     (g)  Effective date--(1)  In general.  This section shall
apply to payments of interest made after December 31, 1997. 
     (2)  Transition rule.  For purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(i)
of this section, a withholding agent that holds a valid Form W-8
on a date that is 60 days after these regulations are published
as final regulations in the Federal Register may treat it as a
valid withholding certificate until its validity expires under
applicable provisions as in effect on April 22, 1996.
     Par. 5.  Section 1.1441-0 is added to read as follows:
1.1441-0  Outline of regulation provisions for section 1441.
     This section lists captions contained in 1.1441-1, 1.1441-

     Par. 6.  Section 1.1441-1 is revised to read as follows: 

1.1441-1  Requirement for the deduction and withholding of tax
on payments to foreign persons.

     (a)  Purpose and scope.  This section and 1.1441-2 through
1.1441-9 provide rules for withholding under section 1441 when a
payment is made to a foreign person.  This section provides
definitions of terms used in chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue
Code and regulations under that chapter.  It prescribes
procedures to determine whether a tax must be withheld under
chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code, including presumptions
for determining whether a withholding agent should treat a payee
as a United States (U.S.) person or a foreign person.  Special
procedures regarding payments to foreign persons that act as
intermediaries are also provided.  Section 1.1441-2 describes the
income subject to withholding under section 1441.  Section
1.1441-3 provides rules regarding the amount subject to
withholding.  Section 1.1441-4 provides exemptions from
withholding for certain income effectively connected with the
conduct of a trade or business in the United States, including
certain compensation for the personal services of an individual. 
Section 1.1441-5 provides rules regarding withholding on payments
made to pass-through entities.  Section 1.1441-6 provides rules
regarding claiming a reduced rate of withholding under an income
tax treaty.  Section 1.1441-7 defines the term withholding agent
and provides rules regarding withholding agents' obligations to
withhold.  Section 1.1441-8T provides rules for income received
by a foreign government that is excluded from gross income under
section 892.  Section 1.1441-9 provides rules for payments to
foreign tax exempt organizations and foreign private foundations.
     (b)  General rule of withholding.  A withholding agent (as
defined in 1.1441-7(a)) must withhold 30 percent of the gross
amount of a payment (as defined in 1.1441-2(e)) of income
subject to withholding made to a payee that is a foreign person
unless the beneficial owner of the income is a foreign person
entitled to a reduced rate of tax and for the withholding agent
holds an appropriate withholding certificate or documentation or
unless the beneficial owner of the income is a U.S. person.  For
this purpose, a payment to the U.S. agent of a foreign person is
treated as a payment to a foreign person if the withholding agent
has actual knowledge or reason to know of the agency
relationship.  For the documentation upon which a withholding
agent may rely in order to treat a payee or beneficial owner as a
U.S. person, see paragraph (d) of this section.  For the
documentation upon which a withholding agent may rely in order to
treat a payee or a beneficial owner as a foreign person, see
paragraph (e) of this section.  For applicable presumptions if
the withholding agent cannot associate the payment with the
required documentation at the time of payment, see paragraph (f)
of this section.  For definitions of foreign person, payee, and
beneficial owner, see paragraphs (c)(2), (3), and (6) of this
section, respectively.  For the determination of income subject
to withholding, see 1.1441-2(a).  For a definition of an
offshore account, see 1.6049-5(d)(3).  For withholding
procedures applicable to payments to U.S. and foreign
partnerships, respectively, see 1.1441-5(a) and (b).  For
withholding procedures applicable to payments to U.S. and foreign
trusts and estates, see 1.1441-5(c).
     (c)  Definitions--(1)  Withholding.  The term withholding
means the deduction and withholding of tax at the applicable rate
from the payment of income.
     (2)  Foreign person.  The term foreign person means a
nonresident alien individual, a foreign corporation, a foreign
partnership, a foreign trust, a foreign estate, and any other
person that is not a United States person for purposes of chapter
3 of the Internal Revenue Code.  A United States person is a
person described in section 7701(a)(30), the U.S. government
(including an agency or instrumentality thereof), or a State and
the District of Columbia (including an agency or instrumentality
thereof).
     (3)  Payee--(i)  General rule.  Except as otherwise provided
in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, a payee is the person to
whom a payment is made.  See 1.1441-2(e) for the determination
of when a payment is considered made.  Treatment of a person as a
payee has consequences for purposes of withholding under chapter
3 of the Internal Revenue Code (see paragraph (b) of this section
(relating to the general rule of withholding)) as well as for
purposes of reporting income under the provisions of chapter 61
of the Internal Revenue Code and backup withholding under section
3406.  See paragraph (d)(3) of this section for when a
withholding agent may treat a payment to a foreign person as a
payment made to a payee that is a U.S. person if the foreign
person is acting for or representing the U.S. person.
     (ii)  Payments to a foreign partnership.  For purposes of
chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code, section 3406, and chapter
61 of the Internal Revenue Code, a payment made to a foreign
partnership shall be treated as a payment made to the partners
rather than to the partnership.  A withholding agent may,
however, treat a payment to a foreign partnership as made to the
partnership (rather than to its partners) if, with respect to the
partnership, it holds an intermediary withholding certificate
described in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section (relating to a
certificate from a qualified intermediary) or an intermediary
withholding certificate described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of
this section (relating to a certificate from a foreign
partnership) representing that the income to which the
certificate relates is effectively connected with the conduct of
a trade or business in the United States.  In addition, if the
withholding agent holds an intermediary withholding certificate
described in paragraph (e)(3)(iv) of this section (relating to a
certificate from an agent, nominee, representative, etc.), then
the payee shall be the person on whose behalf the partnership is
receiving the payment.  In the case of tiered foreign
partnerships that are not treated as payees under the provisions
of this paragraph (c)(3)(ii), the payees shall be the partners of
the next higher-tier foreign partnership.  Thus, the rules of
this paragraph (c)(3) shall apply through any number of tiers of
foreign partnerships in order to determine which partner is
treated as the payee.  For example, if a payment is made to a
foreign partnership (second tier) and one of the partners of the
second tier partnership is another foreign partnership (first
tier) with two individual partners, the payment to the second
tier is treated as made to the individual partners of the first
tier (unless the second tier partnership has furnished one of the
intermediary withholding certificates referred to in this
paragraph (c)(3)(ii)).  If one of the partners in the first tier
is a domestic partnership, the domestic partnership is treated as
the payee under the provisions of paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this
section, even though one of the partners of the domestic
partnership might be a foreign partnership.  If the first tier
foreign partnership is a nominee and furnishes an intermediary
withholding certificate described in paragraph (e)(3)(iv) of this
section, the person on whose behalf the first tier partnership
receives the payment is treated as the payee.  See 1.1441-5(b)
for rules regarding procedures applicable to beneficial owners'
claims of reduced rate of withholding under chapter 3 of the
Internal Revenue Code.  
     (4)  Individual--(i)  Alien individual.  The term alien
individual means an individual who is not a citizen or a national
of the United States.  See 1.1-1(c).
     (ii)  Nonresident alien individual.  The term nonresident
alien individual means a person described in section
7701(b)(1)(B), an alien individual who is a resident of a foreign
country under the residence article of an income tax treaty and
301.7701(b)-7(a)(1) of this chapter, or an alien individual who
is a resident of Puerto Rico, Guam, the Commonwealth of Northern
Mariana Islands, the U.S. Virgin Islands, or American Samoa as
determined under 301.7701(b)-1(d) of this chapter.  An  alien
individual who has made an election under section 6013(g) or (h)
to be treated as a resident of the United States is nevertheless
treated as a nonresident alien individual for purposes of
withholding under chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code.
     (5)  Foreign corporations.  For purposes of this section, a
corporation created or organized in Guam, the Commonwealth of
Northern Mariana Islands, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and American
Samoa, is not treated as a foreign corporation if the
requirements of subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of section
881(b)(1) are met for such corporation.  Further, a payment made
to a foreign government or an international organization shall be
treated as a payment made to a foreign corporation for purposes
of withholding under chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code.
     (6)  Beneficial owner--(i)  General rule.  In the case of a
payment of income, the term beneficial owner means the person
required under U.S. tax principles to include the amount paid in
gross income under section 61 (determined without regard to an
exclusion or exemption from gross income under the Internal
Revenue Code).  Thus, a nominee, agent, custodian, or any person
acting in a similar capacity is not the beneficial owner.  In the
case of a scholarship, the student receiving the scholarship is
the beneficial owner of that scholarship.  
     (ii)  Special rules for certain entities--(A)  General rule. 
The beneficial owners of income paid to a partnership are those
persons that, under U.S. tax principles, are the taxpayers with
respect to that income in their separate or individual
capacities.  For example, a partnership (first tier) that is a
partner in another partnership (second tier) is not the
beneficial owner of income paid to the second tier partnership
since the first tier partnership is not liable for income tax
under U.S. tax principles.  See, however, 1.1441-5(a) for
applicable withholding procedures for payments to a domestic
partnership.  See also 1.1441-5(b)(2) for applicable withholding
procedures for payments to a foreign partnership where one of the
partners (at any level in the chain of tiers) is a domestic
partnership.  
     (B)  Special rules when an income tax treaty applies.  For
purposes of claiming a reduction in the rate of withholding on
income paid to a foreign entity based on an income tax treaty
between the United States and a foreign country, the tax
principles in effect under the laws of that foreign country shall
apply to determine whether the entity or the persons holding an
interest in that entity are required to include the amounts in
income and, therefore, whether, under the principles of this
paragraph (c)(6), the entity or the interest holders in the
entity are the beneficial owners of the income.  See 1.1441-
6(b)(4)(iii) permitting a withholding agent to treat, at its
option, payments made to a single foreign entity as beneficially
owned in part by the entity and, in part, by any one or more
persons holding an interest in the entity.  The possibility of
dual treatment may also occur if a reduced rate of tax is claimed
under the Internal Revenue Code for certain types of income and
under a U.S. income tax treaty for other types of income or if
reduced rates are claimed under different tax treaties.  For
purposes of this paragraph (c)(6)(ii)(B), the term foreign entity
does not include a trust or an estate.  See 1.1441-6(b)(4) for
procedures governing claims of benefits under an income tax
treaty.
     (C)  Trusts.  The provisions of paragraphs (c)(6)(i) and
(c)(6)(ii)(A) of this section shall not apply to a trust, whether
domestic or foreign.  The beneficial owner of income paid to a
trust shall be determined under the provisions of 1.1441-3(f)
and (g), as in effect on the date preceding the date on which
this document is published as a final regulation in the Federal
Register.
     (7)  Chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code.  For purposes
of the regulations under sections 1441, 1442, and 1443, any
reference to chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code shall not
include references to sections 1445 and 1446, unless the context
indicates otherwise.
     (d)  Claim of  U.S. status by payee or beneficial owner--(1) 
In general.  Payments made to a U.S. person are not subject to
the withholding of tax under section 1441, absent actual
knowledge or reason to know that the U.S. person may be acting as
an agent for a foreign person.  See paragraph (b) of this
section.  Absent actual knowledge or reason to know otherwise, a
withholding agent may apply the provisions of this paragraph (d)
to a payment of income otherwise subject to withholding to
determine whether to treat the payment as made to a U.S. person. 
See paragraph (f) of this section for applicable presumptions if
the withholding agent cannot associate the payment with the
required documentation prior to the time of payment.  
     (2)  Payments to a payee that is a U.S. person--(i) 
Reportable payments.  If a reportable payment (as defined in
section 3406(b)) is made to a payee that is not an exempt
recipient (as defined under the applicable information reporting
provisions of chapter 61 of the Internal Revenue Code), the
withholding agent may treat the payment as made to a U.S. person
if the payee complies with the procedures described in
31.3406(d)-1 through 31.3406(d)-5 of this chapter (including
requiring a payee to furnish its taxpayer identifying number) and
the withholding agent meets all the requirements described in
31.3406(h)-3(e) of this chapter regarding reliance by a payor on
a Form W-9).
     (ii)  Payments to exempt recipients and certain other
payments.  If a reportable payment is made to a payee that is an
exempt recipient (as defined under the applicable information
reporting provisions of chapter 61 of the Internal Revenue Code)
or is a scholarship, grant, pension, or annuity, a withholding
agent may treat the payment as made to a U.S. person if the payee
provides a certificate of U.S. status.  For purposes of this
paragraph (d)(2)(ii), a certificate of U.S. status is a Form W-9
(or such other form as the Internal Revenue Service may
prescribe) that is signed under penalties of perjury by the payee
and contains all required information.  For purposes of this
paragraph (d)(2)(ii), required information consists of the
payee's name, permanent residence address, and taxpayer
identifying number.  The procedures described in 31.3406(h)-3(a)
of this chapter shall apply to payments to joint payees.  A
withholding agent that receives a Form W-9 in order to satisfy
this paragraph (d)(2)(ii) must retain the form in accordance with
the provisions of paragraph (e)(4)(iii) of this section relating
to the retention of withholding certificates.  The rules of this
paragraph (d)(2)(ii) are only intended to provide a method by
which a withholding agent may determine that a payee is not a
foreign person and do not otherwise impose a requirement that
documentation be furnished by an exempt recipient or for payments
subject to this paragraph (d)(2)(ii).
     (3)  Payments to a foreign person acting for a U.S. payee. 
Absent actual knowledge or reason to know otherwise, for purposes
of chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code, section 3406, and
chapter 61 of the Internal Revenue Code, a withholding agent may
treat a payment to a foreign person as a payment made to a payee
that is a U.S. person if it receives an intermediary withholding
certificate described in paragraph (e)(3)(iv) of this
section regarding the foreign person to which is attached the
applicable certification described in paragraph (d)(2) of this
section concerning the U.S. payee on whose behalf the foreign
person is receiving the payment.  See paragraph (e)(5) of this
section for applicable procedures in the case of a payment to a
foreign person acting as a qualified intermediary.  See also,
1.1441-5(b)(1) for applicable procedures in the case of a
payment to a foreign partnership that is not a qualified
intermediary.
     (e)  Beneficial owner's claim of foreign status--(1) 
Withholding agent's reliance.  Absent actual knowledge or reason
to know otherwise, a withholding agent may rely on a claim that
the beneficial owner of income is a foreign person, if, prior to
the payment, it complies with the requirements described in
paragraphs (e)(1)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section.  For this
purpose, a withholding agent acting through an authorized foreign
agent is deemed to comply with such requirements to the extent
its authorized foreign agent so complies.  See 1.1441-7(c)(2)
for the description of an authorized foreign agent.  In the case
of a payment to a person other than an individual, a withholding
agent may rely on the claim of entity classification made on the
basis of the certification (or documentation, if applicable)
furnished to the withholding agent, unless it has actual
knowledge or reason to know that the classification claimed is
incorrect.  
     (i)  The withholding agent holds a beneficial owner
withholding certificate described in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this
section or an intermediary withholding certificate described in
paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section. 
     (ii)  The withholding agent complies with the electronic
confirmation procedures described in paragraph (e)(4)(v) of this
section, if required.
     (iii)  The withholding agent has not been notified by the
Internal Revenue Service that any of the information on the
withholding certificate is incorrect or unreliable.
     (2)  Beneficial owner withholding certificate--(i) In
general.  A beneficial owner withholding certificate is a
statement by which the beneficial owner of the income paid
represents that it is a foreign person and, if applicable, claims
a reduced rate of withholding under section 1441.  A separate
withholding certificate must be submitted to each withholding
agent.  If the beneficial owner receives more than one type of
income from a single payor, the beneficial owner may submit one
withholding certificate to the single payor for the different
types of income.   See paragraph (c)(6)(ii)(B) of this section
and 1.1441-6(b)(4)(i) for the determination of beneficial owner
when a benefit is claimed under an income tax treaty.  A
beneficial owner of an interest in a mutual fund that has a
common investment advisor or common principal underwriter with
other mutual funds (within the same family of funds) may, in the
discretion of the mutual fund, provide one withholding
certificate for shares acquired or owned in any of the funds. 
See 31.3406(h)-3(a)(2) of this chapter.
     (ii)  Requirements for validity of certificate.  A
beneficial owner withholding certificate is valid only if it is
provided on a Form W-8 (or, in the case of personal services
income described in 1.1441-4(b), a Form 8233), its validity
period has not expired, it is signed under penalties of perjury
by the beneficial owner and it contains all of the information
described in this paragraph (e)(2)(ii).  The required information
is the name, permanent residence address, and taxpayer
identifying number (TIN) of the beneficial owner (if required),
the basis for the reduced rate of withholding claimed, if
applicable, (including any applicable tax treaty provisions), and
any other information as may be required (in addition to, or in
lieu of, the information described in this paragraph (e)(2)(ii))
by the regulations under section 1441 or by a form or
accompanying instructions.  A permanent residence address is the
address in the country where the person claims to be a resident
for purposes of that country's income tax.  The address of a
financial institution with which the beneficial owner maintains
an account, a post office box, or an address used solely for
mailing purposes is not a residence address for this purpose.  If
the beneficial owner is an individual who does not to have a tax
residence in any country, the address is where the beneficial
owner normally resides.  If the beneficial owner is a
corporation, then the address is where the corporation maintains
its principal office in its country of incorporation.  Instead of
the Form W-8 (or the Form 8233, if applicable), the withholding
agent may rely on an acceptable substitute form or such other
form as the Internal Revenue Service may prescribe.  See
paragraph (g)(2) of this section for continued validity of
certificates during the transition period.  See paragraph
(e)(4)(vii) of this section for circumstances in which a taxpayer
identifying number is required on a beneficial owner withholding
certificate.
     (3)  Intermediary withholding certificate--(i)  In general. 
An intermediary withholding certificate is a statement by which a
foreign payee represents that it is not the beneficial owner of
the income paid or is a statement furnished by a partnership for
its partners.  It is used either to make representations
regarding the status of beneficial owners of the income or to
transmit appropriate documentation to the withholding agent. 
This paragraph (e)(3) describes the requirements for the validity
of an intermediary withholding certificate issued either by a
qualified intermediary, by a foreign partnership that is not a
qualified intermediary, or by any other person that is neither a
qualified intermediary nor a foreign partnership. 
     (ii)  Intermediary withholding certificate from a qualified
intermediary.  In the case of an intermediary withholding
certificate issued by a qualified intermediary (described in
paragraph (e)(5)(ii) of this section), the certificate is valid
only if it is furnished on a Form W-8 (or an acceptable
substitute form or such other form as the Internal Revenue
Service may prescribe), it is signed under penalties of perjury
by an officer or partner of the qualified intermediary with
authority to sign for the intermediary, and it contains the
information and certifications described in this paragraph
(e)(3)(ii).
     (A)  The name, permanent residence address (as described in
paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section), and the employer
identification number of the qualified intermediary. 
     (B)  A certification that the issuer is a qualified
intermediary.
     (C)  A certification that the issuer has obtained, as
required in the withholding agreement with the Internal Revenue
Service, the appropriate certificates (such as Forms W-8 or W-9)
or any other documentation regarding its account holders or
partners.
     (D)  A statement whether the qualified intermediary is
assuming primary withholding responsibility for the amounts to
which the certificate relates.
     (E) If the information is not assuming primary withholding
responsibility, the information and certificates required under
paragraph (e)(5)(iv)(B) of this section regarding the basis for
any reduced rate of withholding tax claimed.
     (F) Any other information or certification as may be
required (in addition to, or in lieu of, the information and
certifications described in this paragraph (e)(3)(ii)) by the
form or accompanying instructions.
     (iii)  Intermediary withholding certificate from a foreign
partnership.  In the case of an intermediary withholding
certificate issued under the provisions of 1.1441-5(b) by a
foreign partnership that is not a qualified intermediary, the
certificate is valid only if it is furnished on a Form W-8 (or an
acceptable substitute form or such other form as the Internal
Revenue Service may prescribe), it is signed under penalties of
perjury by a partner with authority to sign for the partnership,
and it contains the information and certifications described in
this paragraph (e)(3)(iii).
     (A)  The name, permanent residence address (as described in
paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section), and the employer
identification number of the partnership.
     (B)  The basis for the reduced rate of withholding claimed,
expressed in relation to the distributive share of each partner
to which the certificate relates.  
     (C)  The appropriate withholding certificates for the
partners as required under 1.1441-5(b)(1) (except for an
intermediary withholding certificate furnished in order to claim
a reduced rate for income effectively connected with the conduct
of a trade or business in the United States).
     (D)  A statement that the income is effectively connected
with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, if
applicable.
     (E) Any other information or certification as may be
required (in addition to, or in lieu of, the information
described in this paragraph (e)(3)(iii)) by the form or
accompanying instructions.
     (iv)  Intermediary withholding certificate from an agent,
nominee, representative, etc.  In the case of an intermediary
withholding certificate issued by a person that is not a
qualified intermediary and is not acting for its own account, the
certificate is valid if it is described in this paragraph
(e)(3)(iv).  In addition, a certificate furnished to qualify
interest as portfolio interest for purposes of sections 871(h)
and 881(c) or to qualify dividends on publicly traded stock (as
defined in 1.1441-6(b)(2)) is valid if it is described in
1.871-14(c)(2)(iii).  A certificate is described in this
paragraph (e)(3)(iv) if it is furnished on a Form W-8 (or an
acceptable substitute form, or such other form as the Internal
Revenue Service may prescribe), it is signed under penalties of
perjury by a person authorized to sign for the issuer of the
certificate, and it contains the information and certifications
described in this paragraph (e)(3)(iv).
     (A)  The name, permanent resident address (as described in
paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section) and the taxpayer
identifying number of the issuer of the certificate.
     (B)  A certification that the issuer is not acting for its
own account and is using the certificate as a form to transmit
beneficial owner documentation for the payment to which the
certificate relates (or other applicable documentation concerning
the person for whom the intermediary is receiving the payment.
     (C)  If furnishing an intermediary certificate to transmit
more than one withholding certificate, the certificate may
indicate the basis for the reduced rate of withholding claimed,
based upon the attached withholding certificates.
     (D)  Any other information or certification as may be
required (in addition to, or in lieu of the information and
certification described in this paragraph (e)(3)(iv)) by the form
or accompanying instructions.
     (4)  Applicable rules--(i)  Joint owners.  In the case of a
payment to joint owners, a withholding certificate must be
provided by each owner claiming to be a foreign person.  
     (ii) Period of validity--(A)  Three year period.  Except as
otherwise provided in paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(B) of this section, a
beneficial owner withholding certificate or an intermediary
withholding certificate shall remain valid for three years or
until such time as a change in circumstances makes any
information on the certificate incorrect.
     (B)  Validity period where TIN provided.  A withholding
certificate furnished with a taxpayer identifying number shall
remain valid until such time as a change in circumstances makes
any information on the certificate incorrect but only if the
income for which such certificate is furnished is required to be
reported under 1.1461-1(c)(2)(ii) or the taxpayer identifying
number furnished on the certificate is reported to the Internal
Revenue Service under the procedures described in 1.1461-1(d).
     (C)  Withholding certificate for effectively connected
income.  Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(B) of this section,
the period of validity of a withholding certificate furnished to
a withholding agent to claim a reduced rate of tax for income
that is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or
business within the United States shall be limited to three
years.
     (D)  Computation of three-year period.  The three-year
validity period shall start from the date that the certificate is
signed until the last day of the third succeeding calendar year. 
For example, a certificate signed on September 30, 1998 remains
valid through December 31, 2001.
     (E) Change in circumstances.  If a change in circumstances
makes any information on the certificate incorrect, then the
issuer of the certificate must inform the withholding agent
within 30 days of the change and issue a new certificate.  If a
beneficial owner withholding certificate is used to claim foreign
status only (and not, also, residence in a particular foreign
country for purposes of an income tax treaty), a change of
address is a change in circumstances for purposes of this
paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(E) only if it changes to an address in the
United States.  Further, a change of address within a foreign
country is not a change in circumstances for purposes of this
paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(E). A withholding agent may require a new
certificate at any time prior to a payment, even though the
withholding agent has no actual knowledge or reason to know that
any information stated on the certificate has changed.  
     (iii)  Retention of withholding certificate.   A withholding
agent must retain each withholding certificate for as long as it
may be relevant to the determination of the withholding agent's
tax liability under section 1461 and 1.1461-1.
     (iv)  Electronic transmission of information.  Under
procedures issued by the Internal Revenue Service, a withholding
agent may be permitted to receive in electronic form the
information required to be included on a withholding certificate
or a certificate of U.S. status.  
     (v)  Electronic confirmation of information on withholding
certificate.  Under procedures issued by the Internal Revenue
Service, a withholding agent may be required to use an electronic
on-line system to confirm with the Internal Revenue Service
information concerning any taxpayer identifying number stated on
a withholding certificate or a certificate of U.S. status.
     (vi)  Acceptable substitute form.  For purposes of the
regulations under section 1441, 1442, and 1443, the term
acceptable substitute in the case of a Form W-8 or Form 8233
described in paragraph (e)(2) or (e)(3) of this section is a
document prepared and furnished based on the rules set forth in
31.3406(h)-3(c)(1) of this chapter (relating to substitutes for
a Form W-9).
     (vii)  Requirement of taxpayer identifying number.  A
taxpayer identifying number must be stated on a withholding
certificate when required by this paragraph (e)(4)(vii).  A
taxpayer identifying number is required to be stated on a
beneficial owner certificate if the beneficial owner is claiming
the benefit of a reduced rate under an income tax treaty (other
than with respect to dividends on stock traded on a U.S.
established financial market), an exemption from withholding
because income is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or
business, an exemption under section 871(f) for certain annuities
received under qualified plans, or an exemption based on a
foreign organization's tax exempt status under section 501(c) or
private foundation status.  In addition, a taxpayer identifying
number is required to be stated on all intermediary withholding
certificates.   A taxpayer identifying number is an IRS
individual tax identification number, an employer identification
number, or a social security number as described in section 6109
and 301.6109-1 of this chapter, or any other identifier the
Commissioner may designate.  
     (5)  Qualified intermediaries--(i)  General rule.   A
qualified intermediary, as defined in paragraph (e)(5)(ii) of
this section, may furnish an intermediary withholding certificate
to a withholding agent for purposes of certifying on behalf of
beneficial owners, intermediaries (such as agents or nominees
acting for the accounts of others), other qualified
intermediaries or U.S. payees for the purpose of claiming reduced
rates of withholding tax under section 1441, 1442, or 1443.  Such
certificate is in lieu of transmitting withholding certificates
or other required documentation to a withholding agent.  While
the qualified intermediary is generally required to obtain
withholding certificates or other appropriate documentary
evidence from beneficial owners or payees pursuant to its
agreement with the Internal Revenue Service, it is not required
to attach such documentation to the intermediary withholding
certificate.
     (ii)  Definition of qualified intermediary.  The term
qualified intermediary  means a foreign person that is a party to
a withholding agreement with the Internal Revenue Service and
that is--
     (A)  A financial institution (as defined in 1.165-
12(c)(1)(iv)) or a clearing organization (as defined in 1.163-
5(c)(2)(i)(D)(8)); 
     (B)  A partnership; or
     (C)  Any other person acceptable to the Internal Revenue
Service. 
     (iii)  Withholding agreement--(A)  In general.  The Internal
Revenue Service may, upon request, enter into a withholding
agreement with a foreign person described in paragraph (e)(5)(ii)
of this section pursuant to such procedures as the Internal
Revenue Service may prescribe.  The withholding agreement shall
include the terms, conditions and procedures that the Internal
Revenue Service shall deem appropriate to insure the collection
of the tax due and reporting of information under sections 1441,
1461, 3406 and chapter 61 of the Internal Revenue Code.  
     (B)  Terms of the withholding agreement.   Generally, the
agreement must include provisions dealing with defining,
obtaining, and maintaining appropriate certification and
documentation upon which the foreign person may rely to ascertain
the nationality and residence of beneficial owners and U.S.
payees, reporting account information to the Internal Revenue
Service or otherwise making the account information available to
the Internal Revenue Service, and, if applicable, acting as an
acceptance agent to perform the duties described in 301.6109-
1(d)(3)(iv)(A) of this chapter (as proposed in project number
INTL-0024-94, published on June 8, 1995 (60 FR 30211)).  In
addition the agreement must specify the manner in which the
Internal Revenue Service will verify compliance with the
agreement.  In appropriate cases, the Internal Revenue Service
may agree to rely on audits performed by an intermediary's
approved external auditor's records (including workpapers of the
auditor and reports prepared by the auditor indicating the
methodology employed to verify the entity's compliance with the
agreement).   For this purpose, the agreement shall specify which
auditor or class of auditors is approved.  An external auditor
may not be approved unless it is subject to regulatory
supervision under the laws of the country in which a significant
part of the intermediary activities under the agreement are
expected to occur, its internal procedures require it to verify
that the intermediary complies with the terms of the withholding
agreement and to report non-compliance findings under the
agreement in the same manner as it is required to report other
findings of non-compliance with applicable local laws and
regulatory requirements, and the auditor's relevant records
(i.e., workpapers and reports) are available to the Internal
Revenue Service.  The agreement must include provisions for the
assessment and collection of tax in the event that failure to
comply with the terms of the agreement result in the failure by
the withholding agent or the qualified intermediary to withhold
and deposit the required amount of tax.  Further, the agreement
shall provide that a qualified intermediary that withholds any
amount of tax must make deposits of the tax as required under
1.1461-1(a).  The Internal Revenue Service may require the
posting of a bond conforming to the requirements of 301.7101-1
of this chapter as to form of bond or surety required.  The
agreement shall specify the scope of the agreement in the case of
a foreign person with branches or relevant intermediary
activities in more than one country.  To determine the terms of
any particular withholding agreement, the Internal Revenue
Service will consider appropriate factors including whether or
not the foreign person agrees to assume primary responsibility as
a withholding agent, the type of local "know-your-customer" laws
and practices to which it is subject, the extent and nature of
supervisory and regulatory control exercised under the laws of
the foreign country over the foreign person, the volume of
investments in U.S. securities (determined in dollar amounts and
number of account holders), and financial condition of the
foreign person. 
     (iv)  Assignment of primary withholding responsibility--(A) 
In general.  A partnership that is a qualified intermediary
acting for its own account must assume primary withholding
responsibility.  Any other qualified intermediary may assume
primary withholding responsibility only if it is permitted to do
so under its agreement with the Internal Revenue Service.  A
withholding agent and a qualified intermediary may arrange on who
of the withholding agent or the qualified intermediary shall have
primary responsibility for any amount required to be withheld
under this section and section 3406 for any one or more classes
of beneficial owners or payees and for any or more types of
income expected to be paid to the intermediary.  In a
relationship between a withholding agent and a qualified
intermediary, the qualified intermediary may agree to assume
primary withholding responsibility for some types of income and
not others.  However, unless otherwise specified in the
agreement, primary withholding responsibility for a type of
income must be assumed for all beneficial owners and payees of
that income or for none of them.  
     (B)  Applicable procedures when a qualified intermediary
does not assume primary withholding responsibility.  When a
qualified intermediary does not assume primary withholding
responsibility, the intermediary withholding certificate must
contain the information described in this paragraph (e)(5)(iv)(B)
or in any agreement between the qualified intermediary and the
Service.  The certificate must separately identify the assets
that are associated with each U.S. payee to which the certificate
relates and that generate the type of income described in
1.1441-2(a) (i.e., income that would be subject to withholding
if paid to a foreign person).  The qualified intermediary must
furnish a Form W-9 for each U.S. payee that is not an exempt
recipient and the name and address of each U.S. payee that is an
exempt recipient.  The intermediary withholding certificate must
also separately identify the assets associated with non-U.S.
payees to which the certificate relates and the applicable
withholding tax rate or rates.  If different withholding tax
rates apply, the intermediary withholding certificate must
indicate the applicable rate for each class of non-U.S. payees to
which different withholding rates apply and the assets associated
with each class.  For payments that the intermediary withholding
certificate states are made to U.S. payees, a withholding agent
dealing with a qualified intermediary that has not assumed
primary withholding responsibility must comply with applicable
reporting requirements under chapter 61 of the Internal Revenue
Code in the same manner as if it had received a Form W-9 (or
acceptable substitute form) directly from the U.S. payee.  The
withholding agent must also comply with the return requirements
under section 1461 and 1.1461-1(b)(2)(ii) and (c)(4)(ii) for
payments made to non-U.S. payees.  
     (C)  Applicable procedures when qualified intermediary
assumes primary withholding responsibility.  A withholding agent
relying on an intermediary withholding certificate from a
qualified intermediary representing that the qualified
intermediary assumes primary withholding responsibility as
permitted under its agreement with the Internal Revenue Service
is relieved from the obligation to withhold on payments made to
the intermediary.  The withholding agent must comply with the
return requirements under section 1461 and 1.1461-1(b)(2)(ii)
and (c)(4)(ii) for payments made to the qualified intermediary.
     (v)  Special rules for qualified intermediaries that are
foreign partnerships.  A foreign partnership that is a qualified
intermediary shall be a withholding agent with respect to its
partner's distributive share of income subject to withholding
that is paid to the partnership.  Therefore, it shall withhold
under the same procedures and at the same time as is prescribed
for withholding by a domestic partnership.  See 1.1441-5(a)(2)
for withholding procedures applicable to domestic partnerships. 
In addition, the partnership shall not be relieved from its
obligation to make a return on Form 1065 as required under
section 6031 and the regulations under that section and to
furnish the statements required under section 6031(b) and the
regulations under that section.
     (f)  Presumptions--(1) In general--(i)  Reliance.  Absent
actual knowledge or reason to know otherwise, a withholding agent
or a payor described in 31.3406(a)-2 of this chapter may rely on
the presumptions of this paragraph (f) to determine whether to
treat a beneficial owner or a payee as a U.S. or a foreign person
when, before making a payment of income subject to withholding,
or a payment subject to reporting under chapter 61 of the
Internal Revenue Code, the withholding agent or payor cannot
associate the payment with the required documentation.  When
applying the provisions of this section, any presumption of
foreign status pursuant to this paragraph (f) shall have effect
only for purposes of applying the provisions of paragraph (b) of
this section (regarding the rules of withholding) and may not be
relied upon for purposes of granting a reduced rate of
withholding under the Internal Revenue Code (e.g. section
1441(c)(9) or (c)(10)) or under an income tax treaty.
     (ii)  Required documentation.  For purposes of this
paragraph (f), the term required documentation means the
applicable documentation that is required to be furnished in
connection with the payment under this section, under 1.871-
14(c)(2), or under chapter 61 of the Internal Revenue Code.  A
withholding agent or payor is not able to associate a payment
with required documentation if, for that payment, it lacks
documentation, the documentation it holds lacks information, or
the withholding agent or payor knows or has reason to know that
information associated with the required documentation is
incorrect or unreliable.  For purposes of this paragraph (f)(1),
a withholding agent or payor has reason to know that information
is incorrect or unreliable if the withholding agent or payor
would have reason to know under the rules of 1.1441-7(b)(2) or
cannot reasonably rely on a Form W-9 (or an acceptable
substitute) under 31.3406(h)-3(e) of this chapter.  For purposes
of this paragraph (f)(1), a Form W-9 (or an acceptable
substitute) must contain the information described in
31.3406(h)-3(e)(2)(i) through (iv) of this chapter in order for
a payor to reasonably rely on the Form W-9.  In the case of other
documentation, the required information shall include only the
name, permanent residence address, taxpayer identifying number
(when required), and signature under penalties of perjury (when
required).
     (2) Reportable payments to non-exempt recipients--(i)  In
general.  Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (f)(2)(ii)
and (f)(4) of this section, a reportable payment (as defined in
paragraph (f)(6) of this section) made to a payee who is an
individual or other non-exempt recipient is presumed made to a
U.S. payee for purposes of chapter 61 of the Internal Revenue
Code, section 3406, and this section if, before payment, the
withholding agent or payor cannot associate the payment with the
required documentation (as determined under paragraph (f)(1)(i)
of this section).  In such a case, the withholding agent or payor
must treat the payment as a payment that may be subject to
reporting under chapter 61 of the Internal Revenue Code and the
regulations under that chapter and to backup withholding under
section 3406 and the regulations under that section.  
     (ii)  Special grace period for certain reportable payments
in the case of indicia of a foreign payee--(A) General rule. 
This paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(A) applies to payments of dividends,
interest, original issue discount, broker proceeds described in
1.6045-1(d)(5), and exchanges of personal property or services
through barter exchanges described in 1.6045-1(e)(2).  A
withholding agent or payor may treat the payee as a beneficial
owner that is a foreign person for the grace period described in
this paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(A) if, at the time a payment is first
credited to an account, the withholding agent or payor has the
name and an address in a foreign country for the account holder
or a facsimile copy or an electronic transmission of the
information contained in a withholding certificate described in
paragraph (e)(2) or (e)(3) of this section.  The grace period is
90 days from the date that the withholding agent or payor first
credits the account or, if shorter, until the end of the calendar
year.  If this paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(A) applies, the withholding
agent may then treat the payee as a beneficial owner that is a
foreign person and is, therefore, required to withhold under
section 1441 on the basis of this presumption from the time that
the amounts are credited to the account.
     (B)  Additional withholding in the event of payments or
withdrawals.  If, at any time before provision or correction of
the required documentation within the grace period specified in
paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, the withholding agent
loses control over any part or all of the amounts in an account
described in paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(A) of this section (such as by
making an actual payment from the account or allowing withdrawal
of any part or all of the amounts in the account, other than for
purposes of withholding an amount of tax), then the withholding
agent or payor must treat the payee as a U.S. person for all
amounts credited to the account during the grace period. 
Accordingly, the payor must withhold to the extent required under
section 3406 on all reportable payments made to the account
during the period to which the grace period applies and
thereafter.  The amount of backup withholding is equal to 31
percent of the reportable payments reduced by any amount
previously withheld from the amounts credited to the account.
     (C)  Application of withholding upon expiration of grace
period. If, upon the termination of the grace period described
under paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, the required
documentation has not been furnished or corrected, the payee is
then presumed to be a U.S. person for purposes of section 3406
and chapter 61 of the Internal Revenue Code. Accordingly, the
payor must withhold to the extent required under section 3406 on
all reportable payments credited to the account during the grace
period and thereafter (until appropriate documentation has been
furnished or corrected).  Any amount withheld from the payments
subject to the grace period may be credited toward any amount of
backup withholding due under section 3406.  If the required
documentation is furnished or corrected on or before the
expiration of the grace period described in paragraph
(f)(2)(ii)(A) of this section and establishes that the beneficial
owner is a foreign person, then any amount withheld on any
payment made during the grace period will be treated as having
been withheld under section 1441.  To the extent such amount
exceeds the amount of tax ultimately determined to be owed under
section 1441, the excess shall be treated as an amount of
overwithholding subject to adjustment under 1.1461-2(a), or
refund or credit under 1.1464-1. If, on the other hand, U.S.
status is established by required documentation on or before
expiration of the grace period, then any amount withheld from the
payments made during the grace period may be credited towards any
amount of backup withholding due under section 3406.  To the
extent such tax exceeds the amount required to be withheld under
section 3406, the excess shall be treated as erroneously withheld
from the payee and shall be subject to adjustments as provided in
31.6413(a)-3 of this chapter.
     (iii)  Joint owners or payees.  A withholding agent or payor
may presume that a payment made to joint owners or payees for
whom it cannot associate the required documentation for all
payees is made to U.S. individuals.  For purposes of applying
this paragraph (f)(2)(iii), the grace period rules in paragraph
(f)(2)(ii)(A) of this section shall apply only if each payee
qualifies for it.  In that case, the rules of paragraph
(f)(2)(ii)(B) of this section would apply when any one of the
joint account holders receives a payment, makes a withdrawal, or
reinvests any portion of the funds in the account that are
subject to the grace period.
     (iv)  Special rules for exempt recipients.  If the payee is
an exempt recipient described in 1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii) and the
withholding agent or payor has actual knowledge of the payee's
employer identification number, then the withholding agent or
payor may presume that the payee is a foreign person if the
employer identification number begins with the two digits "98." 
The withholding agent or payor may also presume that the payee is
foreign if the withholding agent's or payor's communications with
the payee are mailed to an address in a foreign country, or if
the payment is made outside the United States (as defined in
1.6049-5(e)). In other cases, the withholding agent or payor may
presume that the exempt recipient is a U.S. person and,
therefore, subject to section 3406 and chapter 61 of the Internal
Revenue Code and the regulations under those provisions.  If a
withholding agent or payor treats a payee as a foreign person
pursuant to the presumption of this paragraph (f)(2)(iv), it must
treat the payee as the beneficial owner and apply the provisions
of section 1441, 1.871-14, and chapter 61 of the Internal
Revenue Code accordingly.  If the withholding agent treats the
payee as a foreign person, it is subject to the return
requirements of 1.1461-1(b) and (c).  The presumption of this
paragraph (f)(2)(iv) may be rebutted by providing the required
documentation to the withholding agent or payor.  
     (3)  Special rules for scholarships, grants, pensions,
annuities, etc.--(i)  Scholarships and grants.  A payment
representing scholarship or fellowship grant income (as defined
in section 117) is presumed made to a U.S. person if the
withholding agent or payor has a record of the payee's U.S. visa
status in its records.  In that case, the withholding agent or
payor has reason to know that such individual is a foreign person
and, therefore, the presumption of this paragraph (f)(3)(i) shall
not apply.   
     (ii)  Pensions, annuities, etc..  A withholding agent or
payor may presume that a payment from a trust described in
section 401(a), an annuity plan described in section 401(a), an
annuity plan described in section 403(a), or a payment with
respect to any annuity, custodial account, or retirement income
account described in section 403(b) is made to a U.S. or foreign
person under the rules of this paragraph (f)(3)(ii).
     (A)  Such payment is presumed made to a U.S. person, if the
withholding agent or payor has a Social Security number for the
payee and a mailing address as described in this paragraph
(f)(3)(ii)(A).  A mailing address is an address used for purposes
of information reporting or otherwise communicating with the
payee that is an address in the United States or in certain
foreign countries with which the United States has an income tax
treaty.  For this purpose, a income tax treaty must provide that
the payee, if an individual resident in that country, would be
entitled to an exemption from U.S. tax on amounts described in
this paragraph (f)(3)(ii).
     (B) Such payment is presumed made to a foreign person in all
cases not described in paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(A) of this section.  
     (4)  Special rules for pass-through entities--(i)  Payments
to partnerships.  In the case of a payment to a partnership, the
presumptions of this paragraph (f)(4)(i) shall apply to determine
whether to treat the partnership as a domestic or foreign
partnership.  This determination must be made before determining
who are the payees under paragraph (c)(3) of this section. If the
withholding agent or payor has actual knowledge of the
partnership's employer identification number, then the
withholding agent or payor may presume that the partnership is a
foreign partnership if the employer identification number begins
with the two digits "98."  The withholding agent or payor may
also presume that the partnership is foreign if the withholding
agent's or payor's communications with the partnership are mailed
to an address in a foreign country, or if the payment is made
outside the United States (as defined in 1.6049-5(e)).  In all
other cases, the withholding agent or payor may presume that the
partnership is domestic.  The presumptions in this paragraph
(f)(4)(i) may be rebutted by providing the required documentation
to the withholding agent or payor.  
     (ii)  Payments to a foreign partnership.  A withholding
agent or payor that makes a reportable payment to a partnership
that it treats as a foreign partnership may presume that a
partner is a U.S. payee that is not an exempt recipient if,
before payment, the withholding agent cannot associate the
payment with the required documentation for the partner. See
paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section treating partners of a
foreign partnership as payees. In such case, the withholding
agent or payor must treat the portion of the payment allocable to
the partner as made to a U.S. payee who is not an exempt
recipient.  Thus, the payment may be subject to reporting under
chapter 61 of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations under
that chapter and to backup withholding under section 3406 and the
regulations under that section.  The portion of a payment
allocable to a partner shall be determined based on the
distributive shares of the partnership income allocable to each
partner.  
     (iii)  Partners' distributive shares--(A)  Domestic
partnership.  For purposes of this paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(A), a
domestic partnership may presume that a partner is a U.S. payee
that is not an exempt recipient if, at the time it is required to
withhold on the amount, the partnership cannot associate the
payment with the required documentation for that partner and the
amount relates to a reportable payment made to the partnership.  
     (B)  Foreign partnership.  For purposes of this paragraph
(f)(4)(iii)(B), a foreign partnership that is a qualified
intermediary may treat a partner as a foreign payee if, at the
time it is required to withhold on the amount, it cannot
associate the amount with the required documentation for that
partner.  
     (5)  Failure to act in accordance with presumptions.  A
withholding agent that, contrary to the presumptions in this
paragraph (f), grants a claim of reduced rate of withholding
under section 1441 on income subject to withholding will be
liable under section 1461 for the tax required to be withheld
under section 1441, without the benefit of a reduced rate unless
the withholding agent can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the
District Director or the Assistant Commissioner (International)
that the proper amount of tax, if any, was in fact paid to the
Internal Revenue Service.  Proof of payment of tax may be
established on the basis of a Form 4669 (or such other form as
the Internal Revenue Service may prescribe), establishing the
amount of tax, if any, actually paid by the beneficial owner on
the income.  Proof that a reduced rate of withholding was
appropriate may also be established on the basis of the required
documentation described in paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section. 
However, if the required documentation was not received by the
withholding agent before the time the payment was made or within
the grace period specified in paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(A) of this
section, then the Commissioner, or his or her delegate, may
require additional proof if it determines that the delays in
obtaining the required documentation affect its reliability.  The
withholding agent will be liable for interest under section 6601
regardless of whether the underlying tax liability is due.  In
addition, the withholding agent may be subject to penalties.
     (6)  Reportable payment.  Solely for purposes of the
presumptions in this paragraph (f), a reportable payment is any
payment of income subject to withholding (as defined in 1.1441-
2(a)) or any payment described in section 3406(b),
notwithstanding the provisions in sections 6041, 6041A, 6042,
6044, 6045, 6049, 6050A, 6050N and the regulations under those
sections that provide exemptions from reporting based upon the
status of the payee as a foreign person.  For example, a payment
of interest described in 1.6049-5(b)(14) as a non-reportable
payment if paid to a foreign person is treated as a reportable
payment for purposes of this paragraph (f).  Accordingly, the
withholding agent or payor must determine under the presumptions
described in this paragraph (f) whether to treat the beneficial
owner or payee as a foreign or U.S. person.  See sections 6041
through 6049 and sections 6050A and 6050N and the regulations
under those sections for reporting requirements for amounts
treated as reportable payments for purposes of this paragraph
(f).
     (7)  Adjustment, refund, or credit of overwithheld tax.  If,
as a result of the presumption rules of paragraph (f) of this
section, the amount withheld under section 1441 is greater than
the tax due, adjustments may be made in accordance with the
procedures described in 1.1461-2(a).  Alternatively, refunds or
credits may be claimed in accordance with the procedures
described in 1.1464-1, relating to refunds or credits claimed by
the beneficial owner, or 1.6414-1, relating to refunds or
credits claimed by the withholding agent.  If an amount was
withheld under section 3406, see 31.6413(a)-3(a)(1) of this
chapter.
     (g)  Effective date--(1)  In general. This section applies
to payments of income made after December 31, 1997.  
     (2)  Transition rules.  For purposes of paragraph (e)(2)(i)
and (d)(2)(ii) of this section, a withholding agent that holds a
valid Form W-8, 1001, 4224, 1078, or a statement described in
1.1441-5(b) (as contained in 26 CFR Part 1, edition revised
April 1, 1995) on the date that is 60 days after these
regulations are published as final regulations in the Federal
Register may treat it as a valid withholding certificate until
its validity expires under applicable provisions as in effect on
April 22, 1996.  In addition, the documentation requirements for
dividends on stock traded on a U.S. established financial market
described in 1.1441-6(b)(2) shall apply only to accounts
established after the date that is 60 days after these
regulations are published as final regulations in the Federal
Register.  For accounts established on or before that date, the
documentation requirements under this section shall apply to
payments made after December 31, 1999.
     Par. 7.  Section 1.1441-2 is revised to read as follows:
1.1441-2   Income subject to withholding.
     (a)  In general.  For purposes of the regulations under
section 1441, the term income subject to withholding means items
of income from sources within the United States (not including
items listed in paragraph (d)(1) of this section) that constitute
either fixed or determinable annual or periodical income
described in paragraph (b) of this section or other income
subject to withholding described in paragraph (c) of this
section.  Withholding applies to the gross amount of the payment
made to a foreign person.  See part I (section 861 and
following), subchapter N, chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code,
and the regulations under such part for rules governing the
determination of the source of income.  See section 884(f) and
the regulations thereunder to determine the circumstances under
which interest paid by a foreign corporation is U.S. source
income.
     (b)  Fixed or determinable annual or periodical income--(1) 
In general.  For purposes of chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue
Code, fixed or determinable annual or periodical income is all
income included in gross income under section 61 (including
original issue discount), except for the items listed in
paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
     (2) Exceptions.  For purposes of chapter 3 of the Internal
Revenue Code, the  items of income described in this paragraph
(b)(2) are not fixed or determinable annual or periodical 
income--
     (i)  Gains derived from the sale of property (including
market discount and option premiums), except for gains described
in paragraph (b)(3) or (c) of this section;  
     (ii)  Insurance premiums within the meaning of section 4372
paid to a foreign insurer or reinsurer;
     (iii)  Items of U.S. source income that are excluded from
gross income under any provision of law without regard to the
identity of the holder, such as interest excluded from gross
income under section 103(a); and
     (iv)  Any other income that the Internal Revenue Service may
determine, in published guidance, is not fixed or determinable
annual or periodical income.
     (3)  Original issue discount.  Amounts of original issue
discount are fixed or determinable annual or periodical income. 
However, based on the authority of section 1441(c)(8), only the
original issue discount described in this paragraph (b)(3) may be
subject to withholding.
     (i)  Amounts paid by original issuer.  Amounts paid by the
original issuer (or its paying agent) to the beneficial owner on
any obligation issued after March 31, 1972 and payable more than
6 months from the date of original issue that represent original
issue discount realized by the beneficial owner upon the
retirement of the obligation, or upon payment by the issuer on
the obligation, to the extent that the amount is subject to tax
under section 871(a)(1)(C) or under section 881(a)(3).  This
paragraph (b)(3)(i) only applies to original issue discount as
defined in section 1273(a)(1).  Therefore, it does not apply to
market discount as defined in section 1278(a)(2).
     (ii)  Amounts paid by related obligor.  Amounts paid by the
obligor (or its paying agent) on obligations issued after the
date that is 60 days after these regulations are published as
final regulations in the Federal Register and payable more than 6
months from the date of original issue representing an amount of
original issue discount if the obligor is related to the original
issuer (within the meaning of section 163(e)(3)), to the extent
such accrued amount is subject to tax under section
871(a)(1)(C)(ii) or under section 881(a)(3)(B).
     (iii)  Amounts paid in a sale between related parties. 
Amounts paid on the sale or exchange of obligations issued after 
the date that is 60 days after these regulations are published as
final regulations in the Federal Register and payable more than 6
months from the date of original issue representing an amount of
original issue discount if the seller is related to the purchaser
within the meaning of section 163(e)(3), to the extent such
accrued amount is subject to tax under section 871(a)(1)(C)(i) or
under section 881(a)(3)(A).
     (iv)  Amounts actually known to be taxable original issue
discount.  Amounts paid on obligations issued after the date that
is 60 days after these regulations are published as final
regulations in the Federal Register and payable more than 6
months from the date of original issue representing an amount of
original issue discount if the obligor (or the seller in the case
of a sale or exchange of obligations) has actual knowledge of the
amount subject to tax under section 871(a)(1)(C) or under section
881(a)(3).
     (v)  Amounts for which required documentation is not
furnished.  Any amount of original issue discount paid on
obligations issued after the date that is 60 days after the
publication of these regulations as final regulations in the
Federal Register and payable more than 6 months from the date of
original issue representing an amount that fails to qualify as
portfolio interest under section 871(h) or 881(c) (because of the
failure to furnish the statement described in section 871(h)(5)
and 1.871-14(c)(2)), to the extent the amount is subject to tax
under section 871(a)(1)(C)(ii) or under section 881(a)(3)(B). 
The applicable rate of withholding tax shall be applied to the
entire amount of stated interest, if any, and original issue
discount on the obligation as determined on the date of original
issue if the withholding agent does not know what proportion of
the payment on the obligation represents taxable income. 
Adjustments to any amount of overwithheld tax may be made in
compliance with the procedures described in 1.1461-2(a). 
Alternatively, refunds may be claimed in compliance with the
procedures in 1.1464-1.
     (4)  Securities lending transactions.  [Reserved]
     (c)  Other income subject to withholding.  Withholding is
also required on the gross amount of the following items of
income:
     (1)  Gains described in sections 631(b) or (c), relating to
treatment of gain on disposal of timber, coal, or domestic iron
ore with a retained economic interest.
     (2)  Gains subject to the 30 percent tax under section
871(a)(1)(D) or section 881(a)(4), relating to contingent
payments received from the sale or exchange of patents,
copyrights, and similar intangible property.
     (d)  Items of income not subject to withholding under
section 1441--(1)  Exemptions for which no withholding
certificate or documentation is required.  The items of income
described in this paragraph (d)(1) are not subject to withholding
of tax under section 1441 regardless of the fact that no
withholding certificate or other documentation has been furnished
to establish foreign or U.S. status.
     (i) Portfolio interest paid on bearer obligations that are
described in section 871(h)(2)(A) or 881(c)(2)(A) and 1.871-
14(b). See 1.6049-5(b)(7) regarding exemption from reporting
under section 6049, and thus, from backup withholding under
section 3406.
     (ii)  Original issue discount on any obligation payable less
than 6 months from the date of original issue described in
section 871(g)(1)(B)(i). See 1.6049-5(b)(10), (11), and (14) for
exemptions from reporting under section 6049, and thus, from
backup withholding under section 3406.
     (iii)  Any amount of original issue discount not described
in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.  See 1.6049-5(b)(10) and
(11) for exemptions from reporting under section 6049, and thus,
from backup withholding under section 3406.
     (iv) Proceeds from a wager placed by a nonresident alien
individual in the games of blackjack, baccarat, craps, roulette,
or big-6 wheel. 
     (2)  Exemptions for portfolio interest and income on bank,
etc. deposits requiring a withholding certificate or
documentation--(i)  In general.  No withholding is required under
sections 1441(c)(9) and (c)(10) on interest and original issue
discount that either qualifies as portfolio interest on an
obligation in registered form described in section 871(h)(2)(B)
or 881(c)(2)(B) (including interest on a foreign-targeted
registered obligation described in 1.871-14(e)) or is paid on
deposits described in section 871(i)(2)(A).  A withholding agent
may exempt from withholding an amount of interest and original
issue discount paid on deposits described in section 871(i)(2)(A)
only if, prior to the payment, the withholding agent complies
with the procedures described in 1.871-14(c).  The preceding
sentence does not apply to amounts of original issue discount
described in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section or in 1.6049-
5(b)(10) or (11).
     (ii)  Transition rule.  The documentation requirements for
interest on deposits described in section 871(i)(2)(A) shall
apply to payments made after December 31, 1997 with respect to
accounts established after the date that is 60 days after these
regulations are published as final regulations in the Federal
Register.  For accounts established on or before that date, the
documentation requirements under this section shall apply to
payments made after December 31, 1999.
     (e)  Payment--(1) General rule.  A payment is considered
made when the amount would be includible in the income of the
beneficial owner under the U.S. tax principles governing the cash
basis method of accounting.  A payment is considered made whether
it is made directly to the beneficial owner or paid to another
person for the benefit of the beneficial owner (e.g., to the
agent of the beneficial owner).  Thus, a payment of income is
considered made to a beneficial owner if it is paid in complete
or partial satisfaction of the beneficial owner's debt to a
creditor.
     (2)  Income allocated under section 482. A payment is
considered made to the extent income subject to withholding is
allocated under section 482.  Further, income arising as a result
of a secondary adjustment made in conjunction with a reallocation
of income under section 482 from a foreign person to a related
U.S. person is considered paid to a foreign person unless the
taxpayer to whom the income is reallocated has entered into a
repatriation agreement with the Internal Revenue Service and the
agreement eliminates the liability for the withholding tax.  For
purposes of determining the liability for withholding tax, the
payment of income is deemed to have occurred on the dates of the
transactions that give rise to the allocation of income and the
secondary adjustments, if any. 
     (3)  Blocked income.  Income is not considered paid if it is
blocked under executive authority, such as the President's
exercise of emergency power under the Trading with the Enemy Act,
50 U.S.C. App. 5, or the International Emergency Economic Powers
Act, 50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.  However, on the date that the
blocking restrictions are removed, the income that was blocked is
considered constructively received by the beneficial owner (and
therefore paid for purposes of this section) and subject to
withholding under 1.1441-1.  
     (4)  Special rules for dividends.  For purposes of sections
1441 and 6042, in the case of stock for which the record date is
earlier than the payment date, dividends are considered paid on
the payment date.  In the case of a corporate reorganization, if
a beneficial owner is required to exchange stock held in a former
corporation for stock in a new corporation before dividends that
are to be paid with respect to the stock in the new corporation
will be paid on such stock, the dividend is considered paid on
the date that the payee or beneficial owner actually exchanges
the stock and receives the dividend.  See 31.3406(a)-4(a)(2) of
this chapter.
     (5)  Certain interest accrued by a foreign corporation.  For
purposes of sections 1441 and 6049, a foreign corporation shall
be treated as having made a payment of interest as of the last
day of the taxable year if it has made an election under 1.884-
4(c)(1) to treat accrued interest as if it were paid in that
taxable year.
     (6)  Payments other than in U.S. dollars.  For purposes of
section 1441, a payment includes amounts paid in a medium other
than U.S. dollars.  See 1.1441-3(e) for rules regarding the
amount subject to withholding in the case of such payments.
     (f)  Effective date.  This section applies to payments of
income made after December 31, 1997.
     Par. 8.  Section 1.1441-3 is amended by:
     1.   Revising the heading of the section.
     2.   Revising paragraphs (a) through (e).
     3.   Removing paragraph (f).
     4.   Redesignating paragraph (j) as paragraph (f).
     5.   Revising paragraph (g).
     6.   Removing paragraphs (h) and (i).
     7.   Removing the OMB parenthetical and the authority
citation at the end of the section.
     The revisions read as follows:
1.1441-3  Amounts subject to withholding.  
     (a)  Withholding on gross amount.  Except as otherwise
provided in regulations under section 1441, the amount subject to
withholding under 1.1441-1 is the gross amount of income subject
to withholding.  The gross amount of income subject to
withholding may not be reduced by any deductions, except to the
extent that one or more personal exemption is allowed as provided
under 1.1441-4(b)(6).
     (b)  Withholding on payments on certain obligations--(1) 
Withholding at time of payment of interest.  When making a
payment on an interest-bearing obligation, a withholding agent
must withhold under 1.1441-1 upon the gross amount of stated
interest payable on the interest payment date, regardless of
whether the payment constitutes a return of capital or the
payment of income within the meaning of section 61.  To the
extent an amount was withheld on an amount of capital rather than
interest, adjustments to any amount of overwithheld tax may be
made under the procedures described in 1.1461-2(a). 
Alternatively, refunds or credits may be claimed by the
beneficial owner under the procedures described in 301.6402-2 of
this chapter.
     (2)  No withholding between interest payment dates--(i)  In
general.  A withholding agent is not required to withhold tax
under 1.1441-1 upon interest accrued on the date of a sale of
debt obligations when that sale occurs between two interest
payment dates, even though the interest is subject to tax under
section 871 or section 881.  See 1.6045-1(c) for reporting
requirements by brokers with respect to sale proceeds.  The
exemption from withholding granted by this paragraph (b)(2) is
not subject to the withholding certificate procedures described
in 1.1441-1(e)(1).  However, the exception is not a
determination that the accrued interest is not fixed or
determinable annual or periodical income.
     (ii)  Anti-abuse rule.  The exemption in paragraph (b)(2)(i)
of this section does not apply if the sale of securities is part
of a plan the principal purpose of which is to avoid tax by
selling and repurchasing securities and the withholding agent has
actual knowledge or reason to know of such plan. 
     (c)  Corporate distributions--(1)  General rule.  Subject to
the provisions of this paragraph (c), a corporation making a
distribution with respect to its stock is not required to
withhold under section 1441,1442, or 1443 on the portion of the
distribution--
     (i)  That is treated as a nontaxable distribution payable in
stock or stock rights;
     (ii)  That is treated as a distribution in part or full
payment in exchange for stock;  
     (iii)  That is not paid out of accumulated earnings and
profits or current earnings and profits; 
     (iv)  That is paid by a regulated investment company and is
a capital gain dividend (as defined in section 852(b)(3)(C)) or
an exempt interest dividend (as defined in section 852(b)(5)(A));
or 
     (v)  That is paid by a real property holding corporation
(defined in section 897(c)(2)) or a real estate investment trust
(defined in section 856) and is subject to withholding under
section 1445 and the regulations under that section.
     (2)  Determination of accumulated and current earnings and
profits on the date of payment--(i)  General rule.  In order for
a corporation to determine the amount of withholding tax due on
any distribution with respect to stock, the distributing
corporation may, at its option, either treat the entire
distribution as a dividend as defined in section 316 or may treat
only a portion of the distribution as a dividend if, prior to,
and at a time reasonably close to the date of payment, the
distributing corporation makes a reasonable estimate of the
portion of the distribution that is not a dividend based upon
expected earnings and profits as relevant facts and circumstances
shall indicate.  A reasonable estimate may be made based on the
procedures described in 31.3406(b)(2)-4(c)(2) of this chapter.
     (ii)  Procedures in case of underwithholding.  A
distributing corporation that determines at the end of the
taxable year of the distribution that it underwithheld under
section 1441 shall be liable under section 1461 for the amount 
underwithheld. No penalties shall be imposed for failure to
withhold and deposit tax if--
     (A)  The corporation made a reasonable estimate as provided
in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section; and
     (B) Either--
     (1) The corporation pays over the underwithheld amount on or
before the date that it is required to file a return on Form 1042
for the calendar year of the distribution pursuant to 1.1461-
2(b); or
     (2) The corporation is not a calendar year taxpayer and it
files an amended return on Form 1042X (or such other form as the
Commissioner may prescribe) for the calendar year in which the
distribution is made and pays the additional amount of tax and
interest within 60 days of the close of the taxable year of the
distribution.  
     (iii)  Reliance on reasonable estimate by intermediary.  For
purposes of determining whether the payment of a corporate
distribution is a dividend, a withholding agent that is not the
distributing corporation may rely on representations made by the
distributing corporation regarding the reasonable estimate of
expected earnings and profits made pursuant to paragraph
(c)(2)(i) of this section.  Failure by the withholding agent to
withhold the required amount due to an erroneous estimate that
the Internal Revenue Service has determined was not reasonably
made shall be imputed to the distributing corporation. Therefore,
the Internal Revenue Service may collect any additional amount
from the distributing corporation and subject the corporation to
applicable interest and penalties as a withholding agent.
     (3)  Special rules in the case of distributions from a
regulated investment company.  If the amount of distributions
designated as subject to section 852(b)(3)(C) or 852(b)(5)(A)
exceeds the amount permitted to be designated under those
sections for the taxable year, then no penalties will be asserted
for any resulting underwithholding provided the designations were
based on a reasonable estimate (made pursuant to paragraph
(c)(2)(i) of this section) and adjustments to the amount withheld
are made within the time period described in paragraph
(c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section.  Any adjustment to the amount of
tax due and paid to the Internal Revenue Service by the
withholding agent as a result of underwithholding shall not be
treated as a distribution for purposes of section 562(c) and the
regulations thereunder.  Any amount of U.S. tax that a foreign
shareholder is treated as having paid on the undistributed
capital gain of a regulated investment company under section
852(b)(3)(D) may be claimed by the foreign shareholder as a
credit or refund under 1.1464-1.  The procedures described in
paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section shall apply in the case of
distributions made to an intermediary.
     (4)  Overwithholding of tax.  If the tax on any distribution
has been overwithheld, adjustments may be made in accordance with
the procedures described in 1.1461-2(a).  Alternatively, refunds
or credits may be claimed in accordance with 1.1464-1, relating
to refunds or credits claimed by the beneficial owner, or
1.6414-1, relating to refunds or credits claimed by the
withholding agent.
     (d)  Withholding on certain gains.  Absent actual knowledge
or reason to know otherwise, a withholding agent may rely on a
claim regarding the amount of gain described in 1.1441-2(c) if
the beneficial owner withholding certificate, or other
appropriate withholding certificate, states the beneficial
owner's basis in the property giving rise to the gain.  In the
absence of a withholding certificate, the withholding agent may
withhold an amount under 1.1441-1 that is necessary to assure
that the tax withheld is not less than 30 percent of the
recognized gain. For this purpose, the recognized gain is
determined without regard to any deduction allowed by the
Internal Revenue Code from the gains.  The amount so withheld
shall not exceed 30 percent of the amount payable by reason of
the transaction giving rise to the recognized gain.  Adjustments
to any amount of overwithheld tax may be made in accordance with
the procedures described in 1.1461-2(a).  Alternatively, refunds
or credits may be claimed in accordance with 1.1464-1, relating
to refunds or credits claimed by the beneficial owner, or
1.6414-1, relating to refunds or credits claimed by the
withholding agent.
     (e)  Payments other than in U.S. dollars--(1) In general.
The amount of a payment made in a medium other than U.S. dollars
is measured by the fair market value of the property or services
provided in lieu of U.S. dollars.  The withholding agent may
liquidate the property prior to payment in order to withhold the
required amount of tax under section 1441 or obtain payment of
the tax from an alternative source.  However, the obligation to
withhold under section 1441 is not deferred even if no
alternative source can be located.  Thus, for purposes of
withholding under chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code, the
provisions of 31.3406(h)-2(b)(2)(ii) of this chapter (relating
to backup withholding from another source) shall not apply.  If
the withholding agent satisfies the tax liability related to such
payments, the rules of paragraph (e)(3) of this section apply.
     (2)  Payments in foreign currency.  If the amount subject to
withholding tax is paid in a currency other than the U.S. dollar,
the amount of withholding tax under section 1441 shall be
determined by applying the applicable rate of withholding to the
foreign currency amount and converting the amount withheld into
U.S. dollars on the date of payment at the spot rate (as defined
in 1.988-1(d)(1)) or pursuant to a reasonable spot rate
convention.  For example, a withholding agent may use a month-end
spot rate or a monthly average spot rate.  A spot rate convention
must be used consistently for all non-dollar amounts withheld and
from year to year.  Such convention cannot be changed without the
consent of the Commissioner.  The U.S. dollar amount so
determined shall be treated by the beneficial owner as the amount
of tax paid on the income for purposes of determining the final
U.S. tax liability and, if applicable, claiming a refund or
credit of tax. 
     (3)  Tax liability of beneficial owner satisfied by
withholding agent--(i)  General rule.  In the event the
satisfaction of a tax liability of a beneficial owner by a
withholding agent constitutes income to the beneficial owner and
such income is of a type that is subject to withholding, the
amount of the payment deemed made by the withholding agent for
purposes of this paragraph (e)(3) shall be determined under the
following gross-up formula:  
Payment =            Gross payment without withholding      
                              1-(tax rate)
     (ii) Example.  The following example illustrates the
provisions of this paragraph (e)(3):
     Example.  College X awards a qualified scholarship within
the meaning of section 117(b) to foreign student, FS, who is in
the United States on an F visa.  FS is a resident of a country
that does not have an income tax treaty with the United States. 
The scholarship is $20,000 to be applied to tuition, mandatory
fees and books, plus benefits in kind consisting of room and
board and roundtrip air transportation.  College X agrees to pay
any U.S. income tax owed by FS with respect to the scholarship. 
The fair market value of the room and board measured by the
amount College X charges non-scholarship students is $6,000.  The
cost of the roundtrip air transportation is $2,600.  Therefore,
the total fair market value of the scholarship received by FS is
$28,600.  However, the amount taxable is limited to the fair
market value of the benefits in kind ($8,600) because the portion
of the scholarship amount for tuition, fees, and books is not
included in gross income under section 117.  Under the gross-up
formula, College X is deemed to make a payment of $10,000 ($8,600
divided by (1-.14).  The U.S. tax that must be deducted and
withheld from the payment under section 1441(b) is $1,400 (.14 x
$10,000).  College X reports scholarship income of $30,000 and
$1,400 of U.S. tax withheld on Forms 1042 and 1042-S.

    The revisions and additions read as follows:
 1.1441-4  Certain exemptions from withholding.
     (a)  Certain income connected with a U.S. trade or business
--(1)  In general. No withholding is required under section 1441
on income otherwise subject to withholding if the income is (or
is deemed to be) effectively connected with the conduct of a
trade or business within the United States and is includible in
the beneficial owner's gross income for the taxable year.  For
purposes of this paragraph (a), an amount is not deemed to be
includible in gross income if the amount is (or is deemed to be)
effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business
within the United States and the beneficial owner claims an
exemption from tax under an income tax treaty because the income
is not attributable to a permanent establishment in the United
States.  To claim a reduced rate of withholding because the
income is not attributable to a permanent establishment, see
1.1441-6(b)(1).  This paragraph (a) does not apply to income of
a foreign corporation to which section 543(a)(7) applies for the
taxable year or to compensation for personal services performed
by an individual.  See paragraph (b) of this section for
compensation for personal services performed by an individual.
     (2)  Withholding agent's reliance on a claim of effectively
connected income--(i)  In general.  Absent actual knowledge or
reason to know otherwise, a withholding agent may rely on a claim
of exemption based upon paragraph (a)(1) of this section if,
prior to the payment to the foreign person, the withholding agent
complies with the requirements of 1.1441-1(e)(1) and is
furnished either a beneficial owner withholding certificate
(including one that is transmitted with an intermediary
withholding certificate described in 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iv)), or an
intermediary withholding certificate described in 1.1441-
1(e)(3)(ii) from a partnership acting for its own account
(regardless of whether the distributive share information is
stated on the certificate and whether the certificates described
in 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iii)(C) are attached).  For purposes of this
paragraph (a), a withholding certificate is not valid unless it
includes a taxpayer identifying number.  A statement on the
withholding certificate that the income is effectively connected
with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States and
that the income will be reported by the beneficial owner on an
income tax return will satisfy the requirement of 1.1441-
1(e)(2)(ii) or (e)(3)(iii) that the certificate describe the
basis for the claim of reduced rate.  A withholding agent may
presume that the income is not effectively connected with the
conduct of a trade or business in the United States if the
withholding certificate is silent or if the withholding agent
cannot associate the payment with the required documentation (as
defined in 1.1441-1(f)(1)).  See 1.1441-1(e)(4)(ii)(B)(2) for
the period of validity applicable to a certificate provided under
this section.  A withholding certificate shall be effective only
for the item or items of income specified therein.  In compliance
with 1.1441-1(e)(3)(ii)(A), the validity of the certificate
expires when subsequent circumstances arising during the taxable
year indicate that the income to which the certificate relates is
not, or is no longer expected to be, effectively connected with
the conduct of a trade or business within the United States.
     (ii)   Exemption of certain foreign partnerships and foreign
corporations.  [Reserved] For guidance prior to the date these
regulations are published as final regulations in the Federal
Register, see 1.1441-4(f) as contained in the 26 CFR Part 1,
edition revised April 1, 1995.
     (iii)  Payment to joint owners.  In the case of payments to
joint owners, a withholding certificate must be provided by each
beneficial owner claiming a reduced rate certifying that the
income is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or
business within the United States.
     (3)  Income on notional principal contracts.  A withholding
agent that pays income attributable to a notional principal
contract described in 1.863-7(a) shall have no obligation to
withhold on the amounts paid under the terms of the notional
principal contract regardless of whether a withholding
certificate is provided.  For rules regarding the obligation to
file a return, see 1.1461-1(c)(1)(i) and 1.6041-1(d)(5).
     (4)  Failure to act in accordance with presumption.  A
withholding agent that does not withhold, contrary to the
presumption set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this section that
income is not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade
or business within the United States, shall be liable for the tax
imposed under section 1461, without the benefit of a reduced
rate, unless the withholding agent can demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the District Director or the Assistant
Commissioner (International) that the income is effectively
connected and was included in the Federal income tax return of
the beneficial owner and that the proper amount of tax, if any,
has been paid to the Internal Revenue Service.  Proof of payment
of tax may be established on the basis of a Form 4669 (or such
other form as the Internal Revenue Service may prescribe)
establishing the amount of tax, if any, actually paid by the
beneficial owner on the income.  Proof that a reduced rate of
withholding was appropriate may be established by an appropriate
withholding certificate described in 1.1441-1(e)(1)(i). 
However, if the required documentation was not received by the
withholding agent before the time the payment was made or within
the period specified in 1.1441-1(f)(2)(i)(B)(1), then the
District Director or the Assistant Commissioner (International)
may require additional proof if it determines that the delays in
obtaining the required documentation affect its reliability.  The
withholding agent will be liable for interest under section 6601
regardless of whether the underlying tax liability is due.  In
addition, the withholding agent may be subject to penalties.
     (b)  Compensation for personal services of an individual--
(1)  Exemption from withholding. * * *
   * * * * *
     (ii)  Such compensation that would be subject to withholding
under section 3402 but for the provisions of section 3401(a) (not
including paragraph (a)(6) of that section) and the regulations
under that section.  This paragraph (b)(1)(ii) does not apply to
payments to a nonresident alien individual from any trust
described in section 401(a), any annuity plan described in
section 403(a), or any annuity, custodial account, or retirement
income account described in section 403(b).  Thus, for example,
payments to a nonresident alien individual from a trust described
in section 401(a) are subject to withholding under section 1441
and not under section 3405 or 3406.
* * * * *
     (vi)  Compensation that is exempt from withholding under
section 3402 by reason of section 3402(e), provided that the
employee and his employer enter into an agreement under section
3402(p) to provide for the withholding of income tax upon
payments of amounts described in 31.3401(a)-3(b)(1) of this
chapter.  An employee who desires to enter into such an agreement
should furnish his employer with Form W-4 (withholding exemption
certificate) (or such other form as the Internal Revenue Service
may prescribe).  See section 3402(f) and the regulations
thereunder and 31.3402(p)-1 of this chapter.
     (2)  Manner of obtaining withholding exemption under tax
treaty--(i) In general.  * * * The exemption from withholding
becomes effective for payments made at least 20 days after a copy
of the accepted statement is forwarded to the Assistant
Commissioner (International).
     (ii)  Statement claiming withholding exemption.  The
statement claiming an exemption from withholding shall be made on
Form 8233 (or an acceptable substitute).  Form 8233 shall be
dated, signed by the beneficial owner under the penalties of
perjury, and contain the following information: 
     (A) The individual's name, permanent residence address,
taxpayer identifying number, and the U.S. visa number, if any;
     (B) The individual's current immigration status and visa
type;
     (C) The individual's original date of entry into the United
States;
* * * * *
     (K)  Any other information as the form may require. 
* * * * *
     (v)  Copies of Form 8233.  The withholding agent shall
forward one copy of each Form 8233 that is accepted under
paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section to the Assistant
Commissioner (International), within five days of his or her
acceptance.  The Assistant Commissioner (International) may
review the forms so submitted.  The withholding agent shall
retain a copy of Form 8233.
     (vi)  Electronic filing.  Under procedures published by the
Internal Revenue Service, Forms 8233 may be filed electronically
with the Internal Revenue Service.
* * * * *
     (6)  Personal exemption--(i)  In general. To determine the
tax to be withheld at source under 1.1441-1 from remuneration
paid for personal services performed within the United States by
a nonresident alien individual and from scholarship and
fellowship income described in paragraph (c) of this section, a
withholding agent may take into account one personal exemption
pursuant to sections 873(b)(3) and 151 regardless of whether the
income is effectively connected.  The exemption does not need to
be prorated for purposes of withholding under section 1441.  
     (ii)  Multiple exemptions.  More than one personal exemption
may be claimed in the case of a resident of a contiguous country
or a national of the United States under section 873(b)(3).  In
addition, residents of a country with which the United States has
an income tax treaty in effect may be eligible to claim more than
one personal exemption if the treaty so provides.  Claims for
more than one personal exemption shall be made on the withholding
certificate furnished to the withholding agent.  The exemptions
do not need to be prorated for purposes of withholding under
section 1441.
     (iii)  Special rule where both scholarship and compensation
income is received.  The fact that both scholarship income and
compensation income are received during the taxable year does not
entitle the taxpayer to claim more than one personal exemption
amount (or more than the additional amounts permitted under
paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section).  Thus, if a nonresident
alien student receives taxable scholarship amounts from one payor
and compensation income from another payor, no more than the
total personal exemption amount permitted under the Internal
Revenue Code or under an income tax treaty may be taken into
account by both payors. 
     (c)  Special rules for scholarship and fellowship income--
(1)  In general.  Under section 871(c), certain amounts paid as a
scholarship or fellowship for study, training, or research in the
United States to a nonresident alien individual temporarily
present in the United States as a nonimmigrant under subparagraph
(F), (J), (M), or (Q) of section 101(a)(15) of the Immigration
and Nationality Act are treated as income effectively connected
with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States. 
Such amounts (as described in the second sentence of section
1441(b)) are subject to withholding tax under section 1441, but
at the lower rate of 14 percent.  That rate may be reduced under
the provisions of an income tax treaty.  Claims of a reduced rate
under an income tax treaty shall be made under the procedures
described in 1.1441-6(b)(1).  Therefore, claims for amounts
described in this paragraph (c)(1) may not be shown on a Form
8233.  However, if the payee is receiving both compensation for
personal services and income described in this paragraph (c)(1)
from the same withholding agent, claims for both types of income
may be shown on Form 8233.
     (2)  Alternate withholding election.  A withholding agent
may elect to withhold on the amounts described in paragraph
(c)(1) of this section at the rates applicable under section
3402, as if the income were wages.  Such election shall be made
by obtaining a Form W-4 (or an acceptable substitute or such
other form as the Internal Revenue Service may prescribe) from
the beneficial owner.  Such Form W-4 shall also serve as notice
to the beneficial owner that the income is being treated as wages
for purposes of withholding tax under section 1441.
     (d)  Annuities received under qualified plans.  Withholding
is not required under section 1.1441-1 in the case of any amount
received as an annuity if the amount is exempt from tax under
section 871(f) and the regulations under that section.  A
statement on the beneficial owner withholding certificate that
the annuity is excluded from gross income by reason of section
871(f) and the basis for that exclusion satisfies the requirement
of 1.1441-1(e)(2)(ii) that the beneficial owner state the basis
for the claim of reduced rate.  A beneficial owner withholding
certificate furnished for purposes of claiming the benefits of
the exemption under this paragraph (d) is not valid unless it
includes a taxpayer identifying number.  See 1.1441-1(f)(3)(ii)
regarding applicable presumptions if the withholding agent does
not hold the required documentation prior to payment. 
     (e)  Income of a foreign central bank of issue or the Bank
for International Settlements.  Section 895 provides for the
exclusion from gross income of certain income derived by a
foreign central bank of issue, or by the Bank for International
Settlements, from obligations of the United States or of any
agency or instrumentality thereof or from bank deposits.  Absent
actual knowledge or reason to know that a foreign central bank of
issue, or the Bank for International Settlements, is operating
outside the scope of the exclusion granted by section 895, the
withholding agent may rely on a claim of exemption if, prior to
making the payment, the withholding agent complies with the
requirements of 1.1441-1(e)(1).  The following statement on a
beneficial owner withholding certificate satisfies the
requirement in 1.1441-1(e)(2)(ii) that the beneficial owner
state the basis for the claim of reduced rate: 
     (1)  The bank is a foreign central bank of issue, or the
Bank for International Settlements; and
     (2)  The bank does not, and will not, hold the obligations
or the bank deposits covered by the withholding agreement for, or
use them in connection with, the conduct of a commercial banking
function or other commercial activity.
     (f)  Effective date--(1)  General rule.  This section
applies to payments of income made after December 31, 1997.
     (2)  Transition rules.  A withholding agent that holds a
valid Form 4224 on a date that is 60 days after the date these
regulations are published as final regulations in the Federal
Register may treat it as a valid withholding certificate until
its validity expires under applicable provisions as in effect on
April 22, 1996.
1.1441-4T  [Removed]
     Par. 10.  Section 1.1441-4T is removed.
     Par. 11.  Section 1.1441-5 is revised to read as follows:
1.1441-5  Withholding on payments to pass-through entities.
     (a)  Domestic partnerships--(1)  Exemption from withholding
on payment to domestic partnerships.  A payment of income to a
domestic partnership is not subject to withholding of tax under
section 1441 even though it may have partners that are foreign
persons.  A payor (within the meaning of section 3406) may rely,
in accordance with the procedures under 1.1441-1(d), on a Form
W-9 furnished by the partnership.
     (2)  Withholding by a domestic partnership--(i)  In general.
A domestic partnership is required to withhold tax under 1.1441-
1 as a withholding agent on the gross amount of items of income
subject to withholding that are includible in the distributive
share of income of a partner that is a foreign person.  Pursuant
to the authority provided under section 702(a), each partner
shall take into account separately its distributive share of
items of income subject to withholding, and thus the partnership,
pursuant to section 703(a)(1), shall separately state these items
of gross income when computing its taxable income.  A partnership
shall withhold when any distributions that include items of
income subject to withholding are made.  To the extent a foreign
partner's distributive share of an item of income subject to
withholding has not been actually distributed, the partnership is
required to withhold on the partner's distributive share of that
item of income on the earlier of the date that the statement
required under section 6031(b) and 1.6031-1(b) to be provided to
that partner is mailed or otherwise furnished to the partner or
the due date for furnishing that statement as provided under
1.6031-1(b)(1).  If a partnership withholds on a distributive
share before the income is actually distributed to the partner,
then withholding is not required when the income is subsequently
distributed.   
     (ii)  Reliance on a partner's claim for reduced withholding. 
Absent actual knowledge or reason to know otherwise, a domestic
partnership may rely on a claim for reduced withholding by a
partner, if prior to the time the partnership is required to
withhold, the partnership complies with the requirements of
1.1441-1(d) or (e)(1), whichever is applicable, with respect to
the partner.  See the presumptions described in 1.1441-
1(f)(4)(iii)(A) applicable to a domestic partnership in
determining the U.S. or foreign status of its partners.
     (b)  Foreign partnerships--(1)  In general.  A withholding
agent must treat a payment to a foreign partnership as a payment
to its partners, except to the extent the partnership is treated
as a payee under 1.1441-1(c)(3)(ii).  See 1.1441-1(e)(5)(v) for
payments to a foreign partnership that claims to be a qualified
intermediary.  If the partnership is not treated as a payee, a
withholding agent may, absent actual knowledge or reason to know
otherwise, rely on a claim for a reduced rate of withholding by a
partner if, prior to the payment, the withholding agent holds an
intermediary withholding certificate described in 1.1441-
1(e)(3)(iii) pertaining to the partner.  The certificate will be
considered to pertain to the partner if the appropriate
withholding certificate for the partner is attached to the
intermediary withholding certificate.  The appropriate
withholding certificate for the partner may be a beneficial owner
withholding certificate described in 1.1441-1(e)(2) (for a
partner claiming to be a foreign person and a beneficial owner,
determined under the provisions of 1.1441-1(c)(6)), the
applicable certificates described in 1.1441-1(d)(2) (for a
partner claiming to be a U.S. payee), an intermediary withholding
certificate described in 1.1441-1(e)(3)(ii) or (iv) (for a
partner that is a qualified intermediary or not otherwise acting
for its own account), or an intermediary withholding certificate
described in 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iii) representing that the income to
which the certificate relates is effectively connected with the
conduct of a trade or business in the United States.  A claim
must be presented for each portion of the payment that represents
an item of income includible in the distributive share of the
partner.  When making a claim for several partners, the
partnership may present a single intermediary withholding
certificate to which the partners' certificates are attached.  
     (2)  Special rules in the case of tiered partnerships.  If a
foreign or domestic partnership is a partner of a foreign
partnership, the rules of this paragraph (b)(2) shall apply.
     (i)  A withholding agent may treat any portion of a payment
made to a foreign partnership that represents an item of income
includible in the distributive share of a partner (at any level
in the chain of tiers) that is a domestic partnership as a
payment to a U.S. person if the domestic partnership complies
with the procedures described in 1.1441-1(d) (relating to the
claim of U.S. status by a payee or beneficial owner).
     (ii)  A withholding agent may treat any portion of a payment
made to a foreign partnership that represents an item of income
includible in the distributive share of a partner (at any level
in the chain of tiers) that is a foreign partnership as a payment
to a foreign person if the withholding agent may treat the
foreign partnership as the payee pursuant to the provisions in
1.1441-1(c)(3)(ii).
     (iii)  Where the partner in the foreign partnership to whom
the payment is made (second tier) is a foreign partnership (first
tier), the appropriate withholding certificate for the partner is
an intermediary withholding certificate described in 1.1441-
1(e)(3)(iii) issued by the second tier, and an intermediary
withholding certificate described in 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iii) issued
by the first tier to which is attached an appropriate withholding
certificate for each of the partners of the first tier.  The
rules of this paragraph (b)(2)(iii) shall apply to any number of
tiers of foreign partnerships. 
     (3)  Presumptions.  A withholding agent may apply the
presumption described in 1.1441-1(f)(4)(ii) to any portion of a
payment for which the withholding agent does not receive the
required documentation (as defined in 1.1441-1(f)(1)(ii)).
     (4)  Example. The rules of this paragraph (b) may be
illustrated by the following example:
     Example.  (i)  Facts.  FP is a foreign partnership organized
under the laws of Country X deriving interest that would qualify
as portfolio interest described in section 871(h)(2)(B) if the
statement described in section 871(h)(5) is furnished.  FP has
three partners, A, B, and C.  FP furnishes to the withholding
agent an intermediary withholding certificate described in
1.1441-1(e)(3)(iii) to which it attaches a Form W-9 for A and a
beneficial owner withholding certificate for B.  No documentation
is attached for C.  

     (ii)  Analysis.  Absent actual knowledge or reason to know
otherwise, the withholding agent may rely on A's Form W-9 to
treat A as a U.S. person and, therefore, does not withhold on A's
share of the payment.  The withholding agent must comply with any
information reporting obligations under sections 6042 (i.e.,
issue a Form 1099) with respect to A.  Absent actual knowledge or
reason to know otherwise, the withholding agent may also rely on
B's claim for portfolio interest treatment for its share of the
payment.  The withholding agent must report the payment to B on
Forms 1042 and 1042-S.    Because the withholding agent cannot
associate the required documentation (as defined 1.1441-1(f)(1))
for C's share of the interest income, the withholding agent may,
for purposes of section 3406, treat that amount as a reportable
payment made to a U.S. payee that is not an exempt recipient. 
See 1.1441-1(f)(4)(ii). 

     (c)  Trusts and estates.  [Reserved]
     (d)  Effective date--(1)  General rule.  This section
applies to payments of income made after December 31, 1997.
     (2)  Transition rules.  A withholding agent that holds a
valid withholding certificate on the date that is 60 days after
the date these regulations are published as final regulations in
the Federal Register may treat it as a valid withholding
certificate until its validity expires under applicable
provisions as in effect on April 22, 1996.
     Par. 12.  Section 1.1441-6 is revised to read as follows:
1.1441-6  Claim of a reduced rate of tax under an income tax
treaty. 
     (a)  In general.  Under an income tax treaty in effect
between the United States and a foreign country, the rate of tax
to be withheld on a payment of income subject to withholding may
be reduced if the beneficial owner of the income is a resident of
the foreign country.  Other requirements or conditions of the
treaty, or revenue procedures issued thereunder, for claiming
treaty benefits must also be satisfied, such as a limitation of
benefits provision.  If the requirements of this section are met,
the amount withheld from the payment may be reduced at source to
account for the treaty benefit.  See also 1.1441-4(b)(2) for
rules regarding claims of reduced rate of withholding under an
income tax treaty in the case of compensation from personal
services.
     (b)  Reliance on claim of treaty benefits--(1)  In general.  
Absent actual knowledge or reason to know otherwise, a
withholding agent may rely on a claim that a beneficial owner is
entitled to a reduced rate of withholding based upon an income
tax treaty if, prior to the payment, the withholding agent
complies with the requirements of 1.1441-1(e)(1).  Except as
otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this section,
for purposes of this paragraph (b)(1), a beneficial owner
withholding certificate mentioned in 1.1441-1(e)(1) means a
beneficial owner withholding certificate described in 1.1441-
1(e)(2), that includes the beneficial owner's taxpayer
identifying number and states that the taxpayer has complied with
the advance ruling requirements described in paragraph (e) of
this section (if applicable), and, if the beneficial owner is a
person related to the withholding agent within the meaning of
section 267(b) and 707(b), that the beneficial owner will file
the statement required under 1.6114-1(b) (if applicable).  The
requirement to file an information return under section 6114 for
income subject to withholding applies only to amounts paid during
the calendar year that, in the aggregate, exceed $500,000.  See
301.6114-1(b) of this chapter.  See paragraph (d) of this
section for circumstances under which the withholding agent may
be notified by the Internal Revenue Service that the certificate
cannot be relied upon to grant benefits under an income tax
treaty.  A beneficial owner's taxpayer identifying number on a
withholding certificate is valid for purposes of establishing
proof of residence in a treaty country only if the taxpayer
identifying number is certified by the Internal Revenue Service. 
However, absent actual knowledge or reason to know otherwise, a
withholding agent may rely on a taxpayer identifying number that
appears correct on its face, without having to inquire as to
whether the taxpayer identifying number is certified, if the
permanent residence address on the certificate is in the country
whose tax treaty with the United States is invoked.  See the
confirmation and notification procedures described in 1.1441-
1(e)(4)(iv) and (v). 
     (2)  Special rules for certain dividends.  In the case of
dividends on stock traded on a U.S. established financial market,
a withholding agent may rely on a beneficial owner withholding
certificate described in 1.1441-1(e)(2).  For this purpose, a
U.S. established financial market is a national securities
exchange that is registered under section 6 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78F), or an interdealer quotation
system sponsored by a national securities association registered
under section 15A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  In the
case of payments made outside the United States (as defined in
1.6049-5(e)) with respect to an offshore account (as defined in
1.6049-5(d)(3)), a withholding agent may also consider that it
holds a withholding certificate if it holds a certificate of
residence described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section or
documentary evidence described in paragraph (c)(4) of this
section that the withholding agent has reviewed and maintains in
its records.  The withholding agent maintains the reviewed
documents by retaining either the documents viewed or a photocopy
thereof and noting in its records the date on which, and by whom,
the documents were received and reviewed.  This paragraph (b)(2)
shall not apply to dividends that are exempt from withholding
based on a claim that the dividends are effectively connected
with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States.
     (3)  Competent authorities agreement.  The procedures
described in this section may be modified to the extent the U.S.
competent authority may agree with the competent authority of a
country with which the United States has an income tax treaty in
effect.
     (4)  Special rules for payments to certain foreign entities
--(i)  Determination of beneficial owner.  Under 1.1441-
1(c)(6)(ii)(B), the tax principles in effect under the laws of
the country whose tax treaty with the United States is invoked
apply in certain cases to determine the beneficial owner of
income entitled to claim a reduced rate of withholding under that
income tax treaty.  Thus, if a beneficial owner, as determined
under 1.1441-1(c)(6)(ii)(B), is not a resident of the country
whose law has been applied to determine beneficial owner status,
then a payment to a foreign entity will not qualify for a reduced
rate under that country's tax treaty with the United States even
if the foreign entity receiving the payment is organized in that
foreign country.  Conversely, if a beneficial owner, as
determined under 1.1441-1(c)(6)(ii)(B), is a resident of the
country whose law has been applied to determine beneficial owner
status, then the beneficial owner's share of a payment to a
foreign entity will qualify for a reduced rate under the
applicable income tax treaty (provided other requirements for
qualification are met) even if the foreign entity receiving the
payment is not organized in, or is not a resident of, the foreign
country in which the beneficial owner is resident.
     (ii)  Withholding certificates.  The person claiming a
reduced rate of tax under an income tax treaty shall apply the
rules of 1.1441-1(c)(6)(ii)(B) and paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this
section to determine the beneficial owner of income and
entitlement to a reduced rate under an income tax treaty.  The
beneficial owner so determined may provide, as appropriate, a
beneficial owner withholding certificate described in paragraph
(b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section.  Thus, for example, if the
beneficial owner, as determined under 1.1441-1(c)(6)(ii)(B), is
the interest holder rather than the entity, then the entity shall
be treated as a foreign partnership for purposes of determining
which withholding certificate is appropriate.  If, conversely,
the beneficial owner, as determined under 1.1441-1(c)(6)(ii)(B),
is the entity rather than the interest holders, then the entity
shall be treated as a corporation for purposes of determining
which withholding certificate is appropriate.
     (iii)  Request for dual treatment.  As set forth in 1.1441-
1(c)(6)(ii)(B), a withholding agent may make payments to a
foreign entity that is simultaneously claiming a reduced rate of
tax on its own behalf and a reduced rate on behalf of persons in
their capacity as interest holders in that entity.  In such a
case, the withholding agent may, at its option, accept such dual
claims based, as appropriate, on beneficial owner withholding
certificates described in paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section
or documentary evidence described in 1.6049-5(c)(2)(ii)
furnished by such persons with respect to their respective share
of such payments, even though the withholding agent holds
different withholding certificates that requires it to treat the
entity inconsistently with respect to different payments or with
respect to different portions of the same payment.  See paragraph
(b)(4)(v) Example 2 of this section.  
     (iv)  Reciprocal application by treaty partners.  Paragraph
(b)(4) of this section and the principles of 1.1441-
1(c)(6)(ii)(B) will not apply if the U.S. competent authority
determines that a treaty partner is not reciprocally applying the
principles of 1.1441-1(c)(6)(ii)(B) to entities organized  under
the laws of the United States or to interest holders residing in
the United States.  In such case, the rules set forth in 1.1441-
1(c)(6) shall apply without regard to the rules in 1.1441-
1(c)(6)(ii)(B).  This determination shall be effective upon
publication of relevant guidance by the Service and shall apply
prospectively only.
     (v)  Examples.  This paragraph (b)(4) is illustrated by the
following examples:
     Example 1--(i)  Facts.  Entity A is a business organization
formed under the laws of country Y that has an income tax treaty
with the United States. Under the laws of country Y, A is subject
to tax at the entity level and, therefore, is treated as the
beneficial owner of income it receives and as a resident of
country Y for purposes of the U.S.-Y tax treaty.  A receives U.S.
source royalties from withholding agent R and claims a reduced
rate of withholding under the U.S.-Y tax treaty on its own behalf
(rather than on behalf of its interest holders).  A furnishes a
beneficial owner withholding certificate described in paragraph
(b)(1) of this section claiming to be the beneficial owner of the
royalties.

     (ii)  Analysis.  For purposes of claiming treaty benefits
under the U.S.-Y treaty, A is treated as the beneficial owner of
the royalties under 1.1441-1(c)(6)(ii)(B) since, under the tax
law of country Y, A is required to include the royalties in
income.  R may treat A as the beneficial owner of the income for
purposes of granting the benefit of a reduced rate under the
U.S.-Y tax treaty.

     Example 2--(i)  Facts.  The facts are the same as under
Example 1, except that one of A's interest holders, T, is a
corporation residing in country X.  The U.S.-X tax treaty reduces
the rate on royalties to zero whereas the rate on royalties under
the U.S.-Y tax treaty is only reduced to 5 percent. Under the
laws of country X, A is taxable on a flow-through basis and not
at the entity level and T is required to include in income its
distributive share of A's income.  T claims to be the beneficial
owner of its share of the royalty income paid to A and provides a
beneficial owner certificate to A claiming the benefit of a zero
rate under the U.S.-X tax treaty.  A furnishes to R a beneficial
owner withholding certificate for itself for the portion of the
payment for which A alone claims to be the beneficial owner.  In
addition, it furnishes to R an intermediary withholding
certificate described in 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iii) to which it
attaches T's beneficial owner withholding certificate for the
portion of the payment for which T claims to be the beneficial
owner.

     (ii)  Analysis.   For purposes of claiming treaty benefits
under the U.S.-Y treaty, A is treated as the beneficial owner of
all of the royalty income received from R under 1.1441-
1(c)(6)(ii)(B), since, under the tax law of country Y (i.e.,
under the laws of the country whose treaty benefits are claimed),
A is subject to tax on that income.  However, for purposes of
claiming benefits under the U.S.-X treaty, T may also be treated
as the beneficial owner of its share of the royalty income under
1.1441-1(c)(6)(ii)(B), since, under the tax law of country X
(i.e., the laws of the country whose treaty benefits are
claimed), T is required to include in income its share of A's
income.  Therefore, R may treat the royalty payment to a single
foreign entity (A) as beneficially owned by different persons as
a result of claims presented under different treaties.  R may, at
its option, grant dual treatment, that is, a reduced rate of zero
percent under the U.S.-X treaty on the portion of the royalty
payment for which T claims to be the beneficial owner and a
reduced rate of 5 percent under the U.S.-Y treaty for the
balance.  However, under paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section,
the withholding agent may, at its option, treat A as the sole
beneficial owner of the royalty and grant benefits under the
U.S.-Y treaty only.

     Example 3.  (i)  Entity A is a business organization formed
under the laws of country Y.  A receives from withholding agent R
U.S. source royalties and U.S. source interest income that is
potentially eligible for the portfolio interest exemption under
section 871(h) and 881(c) of the Internal Revenue Code.  A's
interest holders are S, an individual who resides in country Y,
T, an individual who resides in country X, and U, an individual
resident in the United States. The United States has a tax treaty
with both country Y and country X.  The U.S.-Y tax treaty reduces
the rate on royalties to 5 percent, and the U.S.-X tax treaty
reduces the rate to zero.  A is classified as a partnership under
U.S. tax principles.  Under the tax laws of country Y, A is
taxable on a flow-through basis, and S is required to include in
income her distributive share of A's income.  Under the tax laws
of country X, A is taxable on a flow-through basis and T is
required to include in income her distributive share of A's
income.  A furnishes R an intermediary withholding certificate
described in 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iii) to which it attaches--
     
     (A) A Form W-9 for U; and
     
     (B) Beneficial owner withholding certificates for S and T
that claim the portfolio interest exemption and a reduced rate of
withholding under the U.S. treaties with Y and X, respectively.

     (ii)  Analysis.  For purposes of claiming benefits under the
U.S.-Y treaty, S  is treated as the beneficial owner of his
distributive share of royalty income received from R  under
1.1441-1(c)(6)(ii)(B) since, under the tax law of country Y
(i.e., the laws of the country whose treaty benefits are claimed
in the case of S), S is the person required to include in income
her distributive share of the royalty.  Therefore, R may withhold
on S's proportionate share of the royalty income paid to A at the
5 percent rate under the U.S.-Y tax treaty.  For purposes of
claiming benefits under the U.S.-X tax treaty, T is treated as
the beneficial owner of her distributive share of royalty income
under 1.1441-1(c)(6)(ii)(B), since, under the laws of country X
(i.e., the laws of the country whose treaty benefits are claimed
in the case of T), T is the person required to include in income
her distributive share of the royalty.  Therefore, R may withhold
on T's proportionate share of the royalty income paid to A at the
zero rate under the U.S.-X treaty, even though A is not organized
in, or a resident of, country X.  R may rely on U's Form W-9 to
treat U as a U.S. person.  Therefore, R does not withhold on U's
share of the royalty payment.  R also does not withhold on any
portion of the interest paid to A because S and T have furnished
beneficial owner certificates and U has furnished a Form W-9.

     (c)  Proof of tax residence in a treaty country--(1)  In
general.  A beneficial owner establishes proof of its tax
residence in a treaty country for purposes of its claim to the
withholding agent that a reduced rate of tax applies under an
income tax treaty by complying with the procedures described in
this paragraph (c) or with such other procedures as the Internal
Revenue Service may prescribe in published guidance.  For
purposes of this section, the residence of a beneficial owner
must be determined in accordance with the provisions of the
applicable U.S. income tax treaty as may be clarified by any
applicable regulations thereunder or technical explanations
thereof, and any procedures issued by the Internal Revenue
Service on the determination or proper method of certifying
residence under particular income tax treaties.
     (2)  Certification of taxpayer identifying number--(i)  In
general.  A taxpayer may certify its taxpayer identifying number
as required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section by having the
taxpayer identifying number certified by the Internal Revenue
Service either directly as provided under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of
this section or through a qualified intermediary as provided in
paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section. 
     (ii)  IRS-certified TIN.  The Internal Revenue Service may
certify a taxpayer identifying number based upon a certificate of
residence described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section or
documentary evidence described in paragraph (c)(4) of this
section.  The certificate or documentary evidence must be
furnished to the Internal Revenue Service by or on behalf of the
beneficial owner upon application for the taxpayer identifying
number or at any other time, as permitted under such procedures
as the Internal Revenue Service may prescribe.  If the tax
residence of the beneficial owner changes, the beneficial owner
shall promptly notify the Internal Revenue Service of that
change.  In addition, the Internal Revenue Service may exchange
information for the purpose of confirming with the appropriate
tax authority of the other country that the beneficial owner
continues to be a tax resident of that country.  The Internal
Revenue Service may from time to time, in its discretion, request
that the beneficial owner reconfirm its residence in the treaty
country. 
     (iii)  Special rules for qualified intermediaries.  The
Internal Revenue Service may certify a taxpayer identifying
number based upon the certification of a qualified intermediary
described in 1.1441-1(e)(5)(ii) regarding the tax residence of
any of its account holders, or persons owning an interest in the
qualified intermediary, under procedures agreed upon with the
Internal Revenue Service.  If a new account or interest holder
has a taxpayer identifying number at the time it opens an account
or acquires an interest, the qualified intermediary may rely on a
statement by the account or interest holder that appropriate
proof of tax residence in the treaty jurisdiction was previously
provided to the Internal Revenue Service.  In such case, the
qualified intermediary must notify the Internal Revenue Service
each time the account or interest holder's address changes to
another country or when the account or interest holder terminates
its relationship with the qualified intermediary. 
     (3)  Certificate of residence.  A certificate of residence
is generally a certificate issued by the competent authority (or
another appropriate tax authority) of the treaty country of which
the taxpayer claims to be a resident that certifies that the
taxpayer has filed its most recent income tax return as a
resident of that country.  A certificate of residence is valid
for a period of three years or such longer period as the Internal
Revenue Service may prescribe.  The competent authorities may
agree to a different procedure for certifying residence, in which
case such procedure shall govern for payments made to a person
claiming to be a resident of the country with which such an
agreement is in effect.
     (4)  Documentary evidence establishing residence in the
treaty country.  Generally, documentary evidence used to
establish residence in a treaty country must include the name,
address, and photograph of the person seeking to prove residence,
must be an official document issued by an authorized governmental
body (i.e., a government or agency thereof, or a municipality),
and must have been issued no more than three years prior to
presentation to the withholding agent.  A document older than
three years may be relied upon as proof of residence only if it
is accompanied by additional evidence of the person's residence
in the treaty country (i.e., a bank statement, utility or medical
bills).  Documentary evidence must be in the form of original
documents or a certified copy thereof.
     (d)  Joint owners.  In the case of a payment to joint
owners, all owners must furnish a withholding certificate or, if
applicable, documentary evidence or a certificate of residence. 
The applicable rate of tax on a payment of income to joint owners
shall be the highest applicable rate.
     (e)  Related party dividends under certain treaties.  Income
tax treaties between the United States and Austria, Denmark,
Ireland, and Switzerland reduce the rate of tax on dividends
between related corporations to 5 percent subject to the
condition that the relationship between the domestic and foreign
corporations was not arranged or maintained for the purpose of
securing the reduced rate.  A domestic corporation that makes a
distribution to a resident of one of these countries may treat
this condition as satisfied if, prior to the payment, a request
has been made to the Internal Revenue Service for a private
letter ruling determining that the relationship between the
corporation and the shareholder was not arranged or maintained
for such purpose and the Service has either issued a favorable
ruling (and the ruling has not been revoked) or is considering
the ruling request.  
     (f)  Effective date--(1)  General rule.  This section
applies to payments of income made after December 31, 1997.  
     (2)  Transition rules.  For purposes of this section, a
withholding agent that holds a valid Form 1001 or 8233 on the
date that is 60 days after these regulations are published as
final regulations in the Federal Register may treat it as a valid
withholding certificate until its validity expires under
applicable provisions as in effect on April 22, 1996.  In
addition, the documentation requirements for dividends on stock
traded on a U.S. established financial market described in
paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall apply only to accounts
established after the date that is 60 days after these
regulations are published as final regulations in the Federal
Register.  For accounts established on or before that date, the
documentation requirements under this section shall apply to
payments made after December 31, 1999.
     Par. 13.  Section 1.1441-7 is revised to read as follows:
1.1441-7  General provisions relating to withholding agents. 
     (a)  Withholding agent defined.  For purposes of chapter 3
of the Internal Revenue Code, the term withholding agent means
any person, U.S. or foreign, that has the control, receipt,
custody, disposal, or payment of an item of income of a foreign
person subject to withholding. See 1.1441-1(b) (dealing with
general rules of withholding) and 1.1441-1(f) (dealing with
presumptions of U.S. or foreign status in the absence of required
documentation) for determining whether a payment is considered
made to a foreign person.  Any person who meets the definition of
a withholding agent is required to deposit any tax withheld under
1.1461-1(a) and to make the returns prescribed by 1.1461-1(b)
and (c).  When several persons qualify as withholding agents with
respect to a single payment, only one tax is required to be
withheld and only one return (on Form 1042, as required under
1.1461-1(b)), is required to be made.
     (b)  Standards of knowledge--(1)  In general.  If a
withholding agent does not withhold the full amount even though
it has actual knowledge or reason to know that a claim of U.S.
status or of a reduced rate of tax under section 1441 is
incorrect, the withholding agent may be liable for tax, interest,
and penalties under sections 1461 and 1463 and the regulations
under those sections.  A withholding agent that has received
notification by the Internal Revenue Service that a claim of U.S.
status or of a reduced rate is incorrect has actual knowledge
beginning on the date that is 30 calendar days after the date 
the notice is received.  A withholding agent that fails to act in
accordance with the presumptions set forth in 1.1441-1(f) may be
liable for tax, interest, and penalties.  See 1.1441-1(f)(5).
     (2)  Reason to know--(i)  In general.  A withholding agent
will be considered to have reason to know if it has sufficient
knowledge of the underlying facts such that a reasonably prudent
person in the position of the withholding agent would question
the claim made or if the withholding agent has actual knowledge
of sufficient facts to put it on notice that the claim is false. 
     (ii)  Limits on duty to inquire in certain cases.  In the
case of portfolio interest, interest on deposits described in
section 871(i)(2)(A), and dividends described in 1.1441-6(b)(2),
a withholding agent's duty to inquire with respect to a
beneficial owner withholding certificate is limited to the
circumstances listed in this paragraph (b)(2)(ii).  Where one or
more of the circumstances described in this paragraph (b)(2)(ii)
exist for a withholding certificate, the withholding agent may
rely on the withholding certificate only after documentation is
provided in support of the claim of foreign status, or reduced
rate of tax under a tax treaty, and the certificate is corrected,
if appropriate.  
     (A)  The permanent residence address on the withholding
certificate is an address in the United States.
     (B)  The payment is directed to a P.O. Box, an in-care-of
address, a U.S. address, or an account with a financial
institution in the United States.
     (C)  In the case of income for which benefits are claimed
under an income tax treaty, the permanent residence address or
mailing address is not in the corresponding treaty country.
     (D)  The beneficial owner notifies the withholding agent of
an address for mailing purposes and that address is--
     (1)  Different from the permanent residence or mailing
address stated on the withholding certificate provided to the
withholding agent by or for the beneficial owner; and 
     (2)  The address is one that is described in paragraph
(b)(2)(ii)(A), (B), or (C) of this section.
     (E) Such other circumstances as the Internal Revenue Service
may prescribe in published guidance.
     (3)  Universal accounts.  A withholding agent that is a
financial institution dealing with the public and with which a
customer may open an account shall apply the rules of this
paragraph (b) on an account-by-account basis, except to the
extent it uses a universal account system that uses a customer
identifier that can be used to retrieve systemically any other
accounts of the customer.   See 31.3406(c)-1(c)(3)(ii) and
(c)(3)(iii)(C) of this chapter.
     (c)  Authorized agent--(1)  In general.  The acts of an
agent of a withholding agent (including the receipt of
withholding certificates, the payment of amounts of income
subject to withholding, and the deposit of tax withheld) shall be
imputed to the withholding agent on whose behalf it is acting. 
However, if the agent is a foreign person, a withholding agent
that is a U.S. person may treat the acts of the foreign agent as
its own for purposes of determining whether it has complied with
the provisions of this section, but only if the agent is an
authorized foreign agent, as defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this
section.
     (2)  Authorized foreign agent.  An agent is an authorized
foreign agent only if--
     (i)  There is a written agreement between the withholding
agent and the foreign person acting as agent;
     (ii)  The notification procedures described in paragraph
(c)(3) of this section have been complied with;
     (iii)  Books and records and relevant personnel of the
foreign agent are available for examination by the Internal
Revenue Service in order to evaluate the withholding agent's
compliance with the provisions of chapter 3, section 3406, and
chapter 61 of the Internal Revenue Code, and the regulations
under those provisions; for this purpose, the foreign agent's
actual knowledge or reason to know shall be imputed to the U.S.
withholding agent; and
     (iv)  The U.S. withholding agent remains fully liable for
the acts of its agent and does not assert any of the defenses
that may otherwise be available under common law principles of
agency in order to avoid tax liability under the Internal Revenue
Code.
     (3)  Notification.  A withholding agent that appoints an
authorized agent to act on its behalf for purposes of 1.871-
14(c)(2), for the withholding provisions of chapter 3 of the
Internal Revenue Code, or for the reporting provisions of chapter
61 of the Internal Revenue Code, is required to file notice of
such appointment with the Office of the Assistant Commissioner
(International).  Such notice shall be filed before the first
payment for which the authorized agent acts as such.
     (4)  Liability of U.S. withholding agent.  A withholding
agent acting through an authorized foreign agent is liable for
any failure of the agent, such as failure to withhold an amount
or make payment of tax, in the same manner and to the same extent
as if the agent's failure had been the failure of the U.S.
withholding agent.  Such liability shall exist irrespective of
the fact that the authorized foreign agent is also a withholding
agent and is itself separately liable for failure to comply with
the provisions of the regulations under sections 1441, 1442, or
1443.  However, liability for tax, interest, and penalties shall
not be collected more than once.
     (5)  Filing of returns.  See 1.1461-1(b)(2)(iii) and
(c)(4)(iii) regarding returns required to be made where a U.S.
withholding agent acts through an authorized foreign agent.
     (d)  United States obligations.  If the United States is a
withholding agent for an item of interest, including original
issue discount, on obligations of the United States or of any
agency or instrumentality thereof, the withholding obligation of
the United States is assumed and discharged by--
     (1)  The Commissioner of the Public Debt, for interest paid
by checks issued through the Bureau of the Public Debt;
     (2)  The Treasurer of the United States, for interest paid
by him or her, whether by check or otherwise;
     (3)  Each Federal Reserve Bank, for interest paid by it,
whether by check or otherwise; or 
     (4)  Such other person as may be designated by the Internal
Revenue Service.
     (e)  Assumed obligations.  If, in connection with the sale
of a corporation's property, payment of the bonds or other
obligations of the corporation is assumed by the assignee, the
assignee, whether an individual, partnership, or corporation,
shall be a withholding agent to the extent amounts subject to
withholding tax are paid to a foreign person.  Thus, the assignee
shall deduct and withhold such taxes under 1.1441-1 as would be
required to be withheld by the assignor had no such sale or
transfer been made.
     (f) Conduit financing arrangements.  [Reserved]
     (g)  Effective date.  This section applies to payments of
income made after December 31, 1997.
     Par. 14.  Section 1.1441-8T is amended as follows:
     1.  The section heading is revised.
     2.  Paragraph (b) is revised.
     3.  Paragraph (c) is added.
     The revisions and addition read as follows:
1.1441-8T  Foreign government and international organization
exemption from withholding (temporary).
* * * * *
     (b)  Statement claiming exemption.  Absent actual knowledge
or reason to know otherwise, the withholding agent may rely upon
a claim of exemption made by the foreign government or
international organization, if, prior to making the payment, the
withholding agent satisfies the requirements of 1.1441-1(e)(1). 
For purposes of this paragraph (b), a beneficial owner
withholding certificate means a certificate described in 1.1441-
1(e)(2).  A statement on the withholding certificate that the
income is, or will be, exempt from taxation under section 892 and
the regulations under that section will satisfy the requirement
in 1.1441-1(e)(2)(ii) that the beneficial owner state on the
certificate the basis for the claim of reduced rate.
     (c)  Effective date--(1)  In general.  This section applies
to payments of income made after December 31, 1997.
     (2)  Transition rules.  For purposes of this section, a
withholding agent that holds a valid Form 8709 on the date that
is 60 days after these regulations are published as final
regulations in the Federal Register may treat it as a valid
withholding certificate until its validity expires under
applicable provisions as in effect on April 22, 1996.
     Par. 15.  Section 1.1441-9 is added to read as follows.
1.1441-9  Exemption from withholding on exempt income of a
foreign tax-exempt organization and foreign private foundations.
     (a)  Income not subject to tax under section 511.  No
withholding of tax is required under 1.1441-1 on income of a
foreign organization described in section 501(c) of the Internal
Revenue Code that is not subject to the tax imposed by section
511 of the Internal Revenue Code and is exempt from tax under
section 501(a).  See 1.1443-1 for withholding rules applicable
to foreign private foundations.
     (b)  Statement claiming exemption.  Absent actual knowledge
or reason to know otherwise, a withholding agent may rely upon a
claim of exemption by the foreign tax-exempt organization if,
prior to making the payment, the withholding agent meets the
requirements of 1.1441-1(e)(1) (except that the certificate must
contains a taxpayer identifying number).  The requirement in
1.1441-1(e)(2)(ii) that the beneficial owner state on the
certificate the basis for the claim of reduced rate shall be
satisfied by the beneficial owner certifying that the income is
not, or will not be, subject to tax under section 511 and that
the Internal Revenue Service has issued a determination letter
(and the date thereof).  If the organization cannot certify that
it has been issued such a letter, it must provide an opinion of
counsel that it is tax exempt under section 501(c).
     (c)  Effective date--(1)  In general.  This section applies
to payments of income made after December 31, 1997.
     (2)  Transition rules.  For purposes of this section, a
withholding agent that holds a valid Form W-8, 1001 or 4224 on
the date that is 60 days after the date these regulations are
published as final regulations in the Federal Register may treat
it as a valid withholding certificate until its validity expires
under applicable provisions as in effect on April 22, 1996.
     Par. 16.  Sections 1.1442-1 and 1.1442-2 are revised to read
as follows:
1.1442-1  Withholding of tax on foreign corporations.
     For regulations concerning the withholding of tax at source
under section 1442 in the case of foreign corporations, see
1.1441-1 through 1.1441-7 and 1.1441-9.  
1.1442-2  Exemption under a tax treaty.
     For regulations providing for a claim of reduced withholding
tax under section 1442 by certain foreign corporations pursuant
to the provisions of an income tax treaty, see 1.1441-6.
     Par. 17.  Section 1.1442-3 is added to read as follows:  
1.1442-3  Tax exempt income of a foreign tax-exempt corporation. 
     For regulations providing for a claim of exemption for
income exempt from tax under section 501(a) of a foreign tax-
exempt corporation, see 1.1441-9.  See 1.1443-1 for withholding
rules applicable to foreign foundations.
1.1443-1  [Amended]
     Par. 18.  Section 1.1443-1 is amended by:
     1.  Amending the second sentence of paragraph (b)(4)(i) by
removing the words "an affidavit of the foreign organization or".
     2.  Amending the third sentence in paragraph (b)(4)(i) by
removing the words "an affidavit or".
     Par. 19.  Section 1.1461-1 is revised to read as follows:
1.1461-1  Payment and returns of tax withheld.  
     (a)  Payment of withheld tax--(1)  Deposits of tax.  Every
withholding agent who withholds tax pursuant to chapter 3 of the
Internal Revenue Code shall deposit such amount of tax with a
Federal reserve bank or authorized financial institution as
provided in 1.6302-2(a).  If for any reason the total amount of
tax required to be returned for any calendar year pursuant to
paragraph (b) of this section has not been deposited pursuant to
1.6302-2, the withholding agent shall pay the balance of tax due
for such year at such place as the Internal Revenue Service shall
specify.  The tax shall be paid when filing the return required
under paragraph (b)(2) of this section for such year, unless the
Internal Revenue Service specifies otherwise.  See paragraph
(b)(2) of this section when there are multiple withholding
agents.
     (2)  Penalties for failure to pay tax.  For penalties and
additions to the tax for failure to timely pay the tax required
to be withheld under chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code, see
sections 6656, 6672, and 7202 and the regulations under those
sections.  
     (b)  Income tax return--(1)  General rule.  A withholding
agent shall make an income tax return on Form 1042 (or such other
form as the Internal Revenue Service may prescribe) for income
paid during the preceding calendar year that the withholding
agent is required to report on an information return on Form
1042-S (or such other form as the Internal Revenue Service may
prescribe) under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.  See section
6011 and 1.6011-1(c).  The withholding agent must file the
return on or before February 28 of the calendar year following
the year in which the income was paid.  The return must show the
aggregate amount of income paid and tax withheld required to be
reported on all the Forms 1042-S for the preceding calendar year
by the withholding agent, in addition to such information as is
required by the form and accompanying instructions.  Withholding
certificates or other statements or information provided to a
withholding agent are not required to be attached to the return. 
A return must be filed under this paragraph (b)(1) even though no
tax was required to be withheld during the preceding calendar
year.  The withholding agent must retain a copy of Form 1042 for
the applicable statute of limitations on assessments and
collection with respect to the items of income required to be
reported on the Form 1042.  See section 6501 and the regulations
thereunder for the applicable statute of limitations. 
Adjustments to the total amount of tax withheld, as described in
1.1461-2, shall be stated on the return as prescribed by the
form and accompanying instructions. 
     (2)  Multiple withholding agents--(i)  General rule.  Except
as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) and (iii) of this
section, no Form 1042 is required to be filed under paragraph
(b)(1) of this section if a return is filed by another
withholding agent reporting the same income in compliance with
the provisions of this paragraph (b) and any remaining tax due is
paid with the return as required under paragraph (a) of this
section.
     (ii)  Payment to a qualified intermediary.  A U.S.
withholding agent making a payment to a qualified intermediary
(as defined in 1.1441-1(e)(5)(ii)) must file a return under
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, regardless of whether the
qualified intermediary assumes primary withholding responsibility
for the payment, as described in 1.1441-1(e)(5)(iv) and
regardless of whether the qualified intermediary is also required
to file a return under the terms of its agreement with the
Internal Revenue Service.  A qualified intermediary's agreement
with the Internal Revenue Service shall specify the extent, if
any, to which the intermediary is subject to filing requirements
under this section.
     (iii)  Payment to or through an authorized foreign agent. 
Both the U.S. withholding agent making a payment to or through an
authorized foreign agent (defined in 1.1441-7(c)) and the
authorized foreign agent are required to file a return under
paragraph (b)(1) of this section.  
     (3)  Amended returns.  An amended return may be filed on a
Form 1042X or such other form as the Internal Revenue Service may
prescribe.  An amended return must include such information as
the form and accompanying instructions shall require, including,
with respect to any information that has changed from the time of
the filing of the return, the information that was shown on the
original return and the corrected information.  
     (c)  Information returns--(1) Filing requirement--(i) In
general.  A withholding agent must make an information return on
Form 1042-S (or such other form as the Internal Revenue Service
may prescribe) to report the items of income specified in
paragraph (c)(2) of this section that were paid during the
preceding calendar year.  One Form 1042-S shall be prepared for
each beneficial owner (except as otherwise provided in paragraph
(c)(4) of this section regarding multiple withholding agents). 
The Form 1042-S shall be prepared in such manner as the form and
accompanying instructions prescribe.  One copy of the Form 1042-S
shall be filed with the Internal Revenue Service on or before
February 28 of the calendar year following the year in which the
item of income was paid.  It shall be filed with a transmittal
form as provided in the instructions to the Form 1042-S and the
transmittal form.  Withholding certificates or other statements
or documentation provided to a withholding agent are not required
to be attached to the information return.  Another copy of the
Form 1042-S shall be furnished to the payee on or before February
28 of the calendar year following the year in which the item of
income was paid after the calendar year of payment.  The
withholding agent shall retain a copy of each Form 1042-S for the
statute of limitations on assessment and collection applicable to
the Form 1042 to which the Form 1042-S relates.  
     (ii)  Joint owners.  In the case of joint owners, a single
Form 1042-S may be prepared.  However, any one of the owners may
request that it be furnished its own Form 1042-S.  Where more
than one Form 1042-S is issued with respect to a single payment
to joint owners, the aggregate amount of income and tax withheld
reported on the Forms 1042-S cannot exceed the amount of income
to the joint owners and tax withheld thereon.  If a single Form
1042-S is prepared, the form shall state the name of only one
owner and that name shall be that of the person whose status the
withholding agent relied upon to determine the applicable rate of
withholding tax.
     (2)  Income subject to reporting--(i)  In general.  Subject
to the exceptions in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, the
items of income required to be reported on a Form 1042-S are
income subject to withholding (as defined in 1.1441-2(a)),
income on a notional principal contract described in 1.1441-
4(a)(3), and amounts described in sections 6041 through 6050P
that are paid to a foreign person and are not exempt from
reporting under sections 6041 through 6050P or the regulations
under those sections.
     (ii)  Exceptions to reporting.  The items of income listed
in this paragraph (c)(2)(ii) are not required to be reported on a
Form 1042-S.
     (A)  Any item of income paid by a partnership, trust or
estate to the extent the item of income is required to be
reported by the partnership, trust or estate under section 6031
or 6034.
     (B)  Any item required to be reported on a Form W-2,
including an item required to be shown on Form W-2 solely by
reason of 1.6041-2 (relating to return of information as to
payments to employees) or 1.6052-1 (relating to information
regarding payment of wages in the form of group-term life
insurance).   
     (C)  Any item of income required to be reported on Form
1099, and such other forms prescribed under sections 6041 through
6050P and the regulations under these sections.
     (D)  Any item of income paid to foreign governments,
international organizations, and foreign central banks of issue
that are exempt from tax under section 892 or section 895.
     (E)  Income required to be reported on Form 8288 (U.S.
Withholding Tax Return for Dispositions by Foreign Persons of
U.S. Real Property Interests) or Form 8804 (Annual Return for
Partnership Withholding Tax (Section 1446)).
     (F)  Income on deposits described in section 871(i)(2)(A),
unless actually subject to withholding or specifically subject to
reporting under section 6049 and the regulations under that
section.
     (G)  Interest on a foreign-targeted registered obligation
described in 1.871-14(e), except as otherwise provided in
1.871-14(e)(4)(ii)(A).  
     (3)  Required information.  Form 1042-S shall include such
information as is required by the form and accompanying
instructions.  The information shall be based upon the
information provided by or on behalf of the beneficial owner
(e.g., a beneficial owner withholding certificate or documentary
evidence), as corrected and supplemented based on the agent's
actual knowledge or reason to know.  In particular, the Form
1042-S must include the information described in this paragraph
(c)(3), if applicable. 
     (i)  The name, address, and taxpayer identifying number of
the withholding agent.
     (ii)  A description of each category of income paid (e.g.,
interest, dividends, royalties, etc.) and the aggregate amount in
each category expressed in U.S. dollars.
     (iii)  The rate of withholding applied and, if applicable,
the basis for withholding at a reduced rate.  
     (iv)  The name, permanent residence address, and taxpayer
identifying number (if required under 1.1441-1(e)(4)(vii) to be
shown on a beneficial owner withholding certificate or actually
known to the withholding agent making the return) of the
beneficial owner.
     (4)  Multiple withholding agents--(i)  In general.  Except
as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(4)(ii), (iii), and (v) of
this section, no information return is required to be filed under
paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section if a return is filed by
another withholding agent reporting the same income in compliance
with the provisions of this paragraph (c).  
     (ii)  Payment to a qualified intermediary.  A withholding
agent making a payment to a qualified intermediary (defined in
1.1441-1(e)(5)(ii)) must report the payment but may do so on a
single Form 1042-S.  
     (iii)  Payment to an authorized foreign agent--(A)  Filing
obligation of foreign authorized agent.  An authorized foreign
agent (as described in 1.1441-7(c)(2)) is subject to the filing
requirements described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section
because it is a withholding agent.  Therefore, to the extent the
U.S. withholding agent for which it is acting is not reporting
the information required under this paragraph (c), it must report
the information required to be reported under paragraph (c)(3) or
(c)(4)(vi) of this section.  
     (B)  Filing obligations of the U.S. withholding agent.  A
U.S. withholding agent making a payment to an authorized foreign
agent is exempted from the requirement under paragraph (c)(4)(iv)
of this section to make a return on Form 1042-S for each
beneficial owner and may, instead, make a single Form 1042-S to
report the payment made to the authorized foreign agent.  The
exemption in this paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(B) shall apply only to
the extent the authorized foreign agent complies with the filing
requirements under paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(A) of this section. 
     (iv)  Payment to other foreign person not acting for its own
account.  Payment of an item of income to an agent, nominee or
representative for the benefit of other persons in respect of
whom Forms 1042-S are required may not be shown on a single Form
1042-S but must be identified on separate Forms 1042-S for each
beneficial owner if such agent, nominee, or representative is a
foreign person and is not a qualified intermediary or an
authorized foreign agent.
     (v)  Payment to a foreign partnership.  Payment of an item
of income to a foreign partnership that is not a qualified
intermediary and acts for its own account may not be shown on a
single Form 1042-S but must be identified on separate Forms 1042-
S for each beneficial owner (or partner that is a qualified
intermediary or authorized foreign agent).
     (vi)  Required information.  An information return on a Form
1042-S by a withholding agent reporting payments to an
intermediary or to a foreign partnership described in paragraph
(c)(4)(v) of this section must contain the information contained
in this paragraph (c)(4)(vi).  The information on the Form 1042-S
must be based upon the withholding certificates furnished by the
payee, as corrected and supplemented by the withholding agent's
actual knowledge or reason to know.  
     (A)  The name, address, and taxpayer identifying number of
the withholding agent.
     (B)  A description of each category of income paid (e.g.,
interest, dividends, royalties, etc.) and the aggregate amount in
each category expressed in U.S. dollars.
     (C)  The rate of withholding applied.
     (D)  The basis for not withholding or withholding at a
reduced rate.
     (E)  The name, address, and taxpayer identifying number of
the payee.
     (F)  In the case of a payment to a partnership acting for
its own account, the name, address, and taxpayer identifying
number (if required under 1.1441-1(e)(4)(vii) to be stated on
the withholding certificates or actually known to the withholding
agent) of the person for whom a Form 1042-S is required to be
prepared pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (c)(4)(v) of
this section.
      (5)  Magnetic media reporting.  A withholding agent that
makes 250 or more Form 1042-S information returns for a taxable
year must file Form 1042-S returns on magnetic media.  See
301.6011-2 of this chapter for requirements applicable to a
withholding agent that files Forms 1042-S on magnetic media and
publications of the Internal Revenue Service relating to magnetic
media filing.
     (d)  Report of taxpayer identifying numbers.  When so
required or permitted under procedures issued by the Internal
Revenue Service, a withholding agent may attach to the Form 1042
a list of all the taxpayer identifying numbers that have been
furnished to the withholding agent and upon which the withholding
agent has relied to grant a reduced rate of withholding and that
are not otherwise required to be reported on a Form 1042-S under
the provisions of this section.
     (e)  Indemnification of withholding agent.  A withholding
agent is indemnified against the claims and demands of any person
for the amount of any tax it deducts and withholds in accordance
with the provisions of chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code and
the regulations under that chapter.  A withholding agent that
withholds based on a reasonable belief that such withholding is
required under chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code is treated
for purposes of section 1461 and this paragraph (e) as having
withheld tax in accordance with the provisions of chapter 3 of
the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations under that chapter. 
In addition, a withholding agent is indemnified against the
claims and demands of any person for the amount of any payments
made in accordance with the grace period provisions set forth in
1.1441-1(f)(2)(ii)(A).  This paragraph (e) does not apply to
relieve a withholding agent from tax liability under chapter 3 of
the Internal Revenue Code.
     (f)  Amounts paid not constituting gross income.  Any amount
withheld in accordance with 1.1441-3(b)(1) and 1.1441-3(d)
shall be returned and paid in accordance with this section, even
though the item or amount paid to the beneficial owner may not
constitute gross income in whole or in part.  For this purpose, a
reference in this section to an item or amount of income shall,
where appropriate, be deemed to refer to the amount subject to
withholding under 1.1441-3(b)(1) and 1.1441-3(d).
     (g)  Extensions of time for requests made for calendar year
beginning after the date of publication of these regulations as
final regulations in the Federal Register--(1)  Extension of time
to file Form 1042.  The Internal Revenue Service may grant an
extension of time in which to file a Form 1042.  Form 2758,
Application for Extension of Time to File Certain Excise, Income,
Information, and Other Returns, or such other form as the
Internal Revenue Service may prescribe, must be used to request
an extension of time.  The request must contain a statement of
the reasons for requesting the extension.  The request must be
mailed or delivered not later than February 28 of the year
following the end of the calendar year for which the return will
be filed.  
     (2)  Extension of time to file Form 1042-S.  The Internal
Revenue Service may grant an extension of time in which to file
Form 1042-S.  Form 8809, Request for Extension of Time to File
Information Returns, or such other form as the Internal Revenue
Service may prescribe, must be used to request an extension of
time.  The request must contain a statement of the reasons for
requesting the extension.  The request must be mailed or
delivered not later than February 28 of the year following the
calendar year for which the return will be filed.  
     (3)  Extension of time to furnish Forms 1042-S.  The
Internal Revenue Service may grant an extension of time in which
to furnish Forms 1042-S to beneficial owners or intermediaries. 
Form 8809, request for Extension of Time to File Information
Returns, or such other form as the Internal Revenue Service may
prescribe, must be used to request an extension of time.  The
request must contain the withholding agent's name and address,
the withholding agent's taxpayer identifying number, the type of
statement and a statement of the reasons for requesting the
extension.  The request must be signed by the withholding agent
or a person who is duly authorized to sign a return, statement,
or other document.  The request must be mailed or delivered not
later than February 28 of the year following the end of the
calendar year for which the statement will be furnished.  
     (h)  Penalties.  For penalties and additions to the tax for
failure to file returns in accordance with this section, see
sections 6651, 6662, 6663, 6721, 6722, 6723, 6724(c), 7201, 7203,
and the regulations under those sections.  
     (i)  Effective date.  This section shall apply to returns
required for payments made after December 31, 1997.
     Par. 20.  Section 1.1461-2 is revised to read as follows:
1.1461-2  Adjustments for overwithholding or underwithholding of
tax.
     (a)  Adjustments of overwithheld tax--(1)  In general.  A
withholding agent that has overwithheld under chapter 3 of the
Internal Revenue Code and made a deposit of that tax as provided
in 1.6302-2(a) may adjust the overwithheld amount either
pursuant to the reimbursement procedure described in paragraph
(a)(2) of this section or pursuant to the set-off procedure
described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.  Adjustments under
this paragraph (a) may only be made within the time prescribed
under paragraph (a)(2) or (3) of this section.  After such time,
an adjustment to the amount overwithheld can only be claimed by
the beneficial owner with the Internal Revenue Service pursuant
to the procedures described in chapter 65 of the Internal Revenue
Code.  For purposes of this section, the term overwithholding
means any amount actually withheld (determined before application
of the adjustment procedures under this section) from an item of
income pursuant to chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code in
excess of the actual tax liability due, regardless of whether
such overwithholding was in error or appeared correct at the time
it occurred.
     (2)  Reimbursement of tax--(i)  General rule.  Under the
reimbursement procedure, the withholding agent may repay the
beneficial owner for the amount overwithheld by reducing, by the
amount of tax actually repaid, the amount of any deposit of tax
made by the withholding agent under 1.6302-2(a)(1)(iii) for any
subsequent payment period occurring before the end of the
calendar year following the calendar year of overwithholding. 
Any such reduction that occurs for a payment period in the
calendar year following the calendar year of overwithholding
shall be allowed only if--
     (A)  The withholding agent states, on a timely filed (not
including extensions) Form 1042-S for the calendar year of
overwithholding, the amount of tax withheld and the amount of any
actual repayment; and
     (B)  The withholding agent states on a timely filed (not
including extensions) Form 1042 for the calendar year of
overwithholding, that the filing of the Form 1042 constitutes a
claim for credit in accordance with 1.6414-1.
     (ii)  Record maintenance.  If the beneficial owner is repaid
an amount of withholding tax under the provisions of this
paragraph (a)(2), the withholding agent shall keep as part of its
records a receipt showing the date and amount of repayment and
the withholding agent must provide a copy or such receipt to the
beneficial owner.  For this purpose, a canceled check or an entry
in a statement is sufficient provided that the check or statement
contains a specific notation that it is a refund of tax
overwithheld.
     (3)  Set-offs.  Under the set-off procedure, the withholding
agent may repay the beneficial owner by applying the amount
overwithheld against any amount which otherwise would be required
under chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code to be withheld from
income paid by the withholding agent to such person before the
earlier of the due date for filing the Form 1042-S for the
calendar year of overwithholding or the date that the Form 1042-S
is actually filed with the Internal Revenue Service.  For
purposes of making a return on Form 1042 or 1042-S (or an amended
form) for the calendar year of overwithholding and for purposes
of making a deposit of the amount withheld, the reduced amount
shall be considered the amount required to be withheld from such
income under chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code.
     (4)  Examples.  The principles of this paragraph (a) are
illustrated by the following examples:
     Example 1.  (i) N is a nonresident alien individual who is a
resident of the United Kingdom.  In December 1997, a domestic
corporation C pays a dividend of $100 to N, at which time C
Corporation withholds $30 and remits the balance of $70 to N. On
February 10, 1998, prior to the time that C files its Form 1042,
N advises C Corporation that, pursuant to the income tax
convention with the United Kingdom, only $15 tax should have been
withheld from the $100 dividend and requests reimbursement of the
$15 that was erroneously withheld.  Although C Corporation has
already deposited the $30 that was withheld, as required by
1.6302-2(a)(1)(iv), such corporation repays N in the amount of
$15. 

     (ii) During 1997, C Corporation makes no other payments upon
which tax is required to be withheld under chapter 3 of the
Internal Revenue Code; accordingly, its return on Form 1042 for
such year, which is filed on February 28, 1998, shows total tax
withheld of $30, an adjusted total tax withheld of $15, and $30
previously paid for such year. Pursuant to 1.6414-1(b), C
Corporation claims credit for the overpayment of $15 shown on the
Form 1042 for 1997.  Accordingly, it is permitted to reduce by
$15 any deposit required by 1.6302-2 to be made of tax withheld
during the calendar year 1998.  The Form 1042-S required to be
filed by C Corporation with respect to the dividend of $100 paid
to N in 1997 is required to show tax withheld of $30 and tax
released of $15.  
     
     (iii) During 1998, C Corporation is required to withhold
$200 under chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code, all of which
is withheld in June of that year.  Pursuant to
1.6302-2(a)(1)(iii), C Corporation deposits the amount of $185
on July 15, 1998, that is, $200 less the $15 for which credit is
claimed on the Form 1042 for 1997.  On February 28, 1999, C
Corporation files its return on Form 1042 for calendar year 1998,
which shows total tax withheld of $200, $185 previously deposited
by C Corporation, and $15 allowable credit. 

     Example 2.  The facts are the same as in Example 1 except
that paragraph (iii) of Example 1 does not apply and C
Corporation is required to deposit on a quarter-monthly basis the
tax withheld under chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code.  C
Corporation withholds tax of $100 between February 8 and February
15, 1998, and complies with the quarter-monthly deposit
requirement of 1.6302-2(a)(1)(ii) by depositing $75 [($100 x 90
percent) less $15] of the withheld tax within 3 banking days
after February 15, 1998, and by depositing $10 [($100 - $15) less
$75] within 3 banking days after March 15, 1998.    

     (b)  Withholding of additional tax when underwithholding
occurs.  A withholding agent may withhold the tax that should
have been withheld from previous payments from future payments
made to a beneficial owner.  Such additional withholding of tax
may only be made from payments made before the date that the Form
1042 is required to be filed (not including extensions).  See
1.6302-2 for making deposits of tax or 1.1461-1(a) for making
payment of the balance of tax due for a calendar year.
     (c)  Definition.  For purposes of this section, the term
payment period means the period for which the withholding agent
is required by 1.6302-2(a)(1) to make a deposit of tax withheld
under chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code.
     (d)  Effective date.  This section applies to payments of
income made after December 31, 1997.
1.1461-3 and 1.1461-4  [Removed]
     Par. 21.  Sections 1.1461-3 and 1.1461-4 are removed.

citation at the end of the section.
     The revision and addition read as follows:

     (a)  Creditable tax.  The entire amount of the income from
which the tax is required to be withheld (including amounts
calculated under the gross-up formula in 1.1441-3(e)(3)) shall
be included in gross income in the return required to be made by
the beneficial owner of the income, without deduction for the
amount required to be withheld, but the tax so withheld shall be
allowed as a credit against the total income tax computed in the
beneficial owner's return.
* * * * *  
     (c)  Effective date.  This section applies to payments of
income made after December 31, 1997.
     Par. 23.  Section 1.1463-1 is revised to read as follows: 
1.1463-1  Tax paid by recipient of income.
     (a)  Tax paid.  If the tax required to be withheld under
chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code is paid by the beneficial
owner of the income or by the withholding agent, it shall not be
re-collected from the other, regardless of the original liability
therefor.  However, this section does not relieve the person that
did not withhold tax from liability for interest or any penalties
or additions to tax otherwise applicable.  
     (b)  Effective date.  This section applies to failures to
withhold occurring after December 31, 1989.
     Par. 24. Section 1.6041-1, the amendments to paragraph

1.6045-1  Returns of information of brokers and barter
exchanges.
     (a)  Definitions. The following definitions apply for
purposes of this section: 
     (1)  The term broker means any person (other than a person
who is required to report a transaction under section 6043), U.S.
or foreign, that, in the ordinary course of a trade or business
during the calendar year, stands ready to effect sales to be made
by others.  A broker includes an obligor that regularly issues
and retires its own debt obligations or a corporation that
regularly redeems its own stock.  However, with respect to a sale
(including a redemption or retirement) effected at an office
outside the United States, a broker includes only a person
described as a U.S. payor or U.S. middleman in 1.6049-5(d)(1). 
In addition, a broker does not include an international
organization described in 1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii)(G) that redeems or
retires an obligation of which it is the issuer.
* * * * * 
     (d) * * *
     (6)  Conversion into United states dollars of proceeds paid
in foreign currency--(i)  Conversion rules.  When the amount
subject to reporting is paid in a currency other than the U.S.
dollar, the amount subject to reporting under this section shall
be determined by converting such foreign currency into U.S.
dollars on the date of payment at the spot rate (as defined in
1.988-1(d)(1)) or pursuant to a reasonable spot rate convention. 
For example, a withholding agent may use a month-end spot rate or
a monthly average spot rate.  A spot rate convention must be used
consistently with respect to all non-dollar amounts withheld and
from year to year.  Such convention cannot be changed without the
consent of the Commissioner or his or her delegate.  
     (ii)  Effect of identification under 1.988-5(a), (b), or
(c) where the taxpayer effects a sale and a hedge through the
same broker--(A)  In general.  In lieu of the amount reportable
under paragraph (d)(6)(i) of this section, the amount subject to
reporting shall be the integrated amount computed under 1.988-
5(a), (b) or (c) if--
     (1)  A taxpayer effects through a broker a sale in exchange
for nonfunctional currency (as defined in 1.988-1(c)) and hedges
all or a part of such sale as provided in 1.988-5(a), (b) or (c)
with the same broker; and
     (2)  The taxpayer complies with the requirements of 1.988-
5(a), (b) or (c) and so notifies the broker prior to the end of
the calendar year in which the sale occurs.
     (B)  Effective date.  The provisions of this paragraph
(d)(6)(ii) apply to transactions entered into on or after the
date that is 60 days after these regulations are published as
final regulations in the Federal Register.
* * * * * 
     (g)  Exempt foreign persons--(1)  Brokers--(i)  In general.
No return of information is required by a broker with respect to
a customer who is considered to be an exempt foreign person under
this paragraph (g)(1)(i).  Unless it has actual knowledge or
reason to know otherwise, a broker may treat a customer as an
exempt foreign person under the circumstances described in
paragraph (g)(1)(i)(A) through (D) of this section.  See 1.6045-
1(c)(2)(ii) for reportable proceeds paid to foreign persons. 
     (A)  With respect to a sale effected at an office of a
broker inside the United States, the broker may treat the
customer as an exempt foreign person if the broker complies with
the procedures described in paragraph (g)(3) of this section. 
     (B)  With respect to a sale effected at an office of a
broker outside the United States, the broker may treat the
customer as an exempt foreign person if the broker complies with
the procedures described in paragraph (g)(3) of this section or
1.6049-5(c)(2).
     (C)  With respect to a redemption or retirement of stock or
an obligation (the interest or original issue discount on which
is described in 1.6049-5(b)(6), (7), (10), or (11)) or the
dividends on which are described in 1.6042-3(b)(1)(iv)) that is
effected at an office of a broker outside the United States by
the issuer (or its paying or transfer agent), the broker may
treat the customer as an exempt foreign person if the broker is
not also acting in its capacity as a custodian, nominee, or other
agent of the payee.
    (D)  With respect to a sale effected by a broker at an office
of the broker either inside or outside the United States, the
broker may treat the customer as an exempt foreign person for the
period that those proceeds are assets blocked as described in
1.1441-2(e)(3).  For purposes of this paragraph (g)(1)(i)(D) and
section 3406, a payment is deemed to occur in accordance with
1.1441-2(e)(3).
* * * * *
     (2)  Barter exchange.  No return of information is required
by a barter exchange with respect to a client or a member that
the barter exchange may treat as a foreign person pursuant to the
procedures described in paragraph (g)(3) of this section.
     (3)  Certificate of foreign status--(i) In general.  For
purposes of this paragraph (g), a broker may treat a customer as
an exempt foreign person if the broker complies with the
requirements of 1.1441-1(e)(1) (dealing with reliance by a
withholding agent on a beneficial owner's claim of foreign
status).  For purposes of this paragraph (g)(3)(i), the broker
may rely on a beneficial owner withholding certificate described
in 1.1441-1(e)(2).  For purposes of this paragraph (g)(3)(i), in
the case of an individual beneficial owner, the certificate shall
include a certification that the beneficial owner has not been,
and at the time the certificate is furnished, reasonably expects
not to be present in the United States for a period aggregating
183 days or more during the calendar year.
     (ii)  Applicable presumptions.  Absent actual knowledge or
reason to know otherwise, the presumptions under 1.1441-1(f)
shall apply in determining the payee's status where the required
documentation is lacking, incorrect, or unreliable.
     (iii)  Joint owners.  In the case of amounts paid to joint
owners for which a certificate or documentation is required as a
condition for being exempt from reporting under paragraph
(g)(1)(i) of this section, a broker or barter exchange must
receive from each joint owner the required certification or
documentation.  Where any one of the joint owners has not
furnished the required certification or documentation, the
transaction is not exempt from reporting under paragraph
(g)(1)(i) of this section.
     (iv)  Payee.  For a determination of payee, see 1.1441-
1(c)(3).
     (v)  Operating rules.  For purposes of this paragraph (g),
the provisions in 1.6049-5(c)(3) through (6) (regarding
operating rules related to the certificate of foreign status)
shall apply. 
     (4)  Effective date--(i)  General rule.  The provisions of
this paragraph (g) apply to payments made after December 31,
1997.
     (ii)  Transition rules.  A payor that holds a valid Form W-8
on a date that is 60 days after these regulations are published
as final regulations in the Federal Register may treat it as a
valid certificate until its validity expires under applicable
provisions as in effect on April 22, 1996.
* * * * *
     Par. 35.  In 1.6049-4, paragraphs (c)(1)(ii)(A) and
(c)(1)(ii)(G), as proposed in project number INTL-52-86,
published on February 29, 1988, at 53 FR 6000, are revised to
read as follows:
1.6049-4  Return of information as to interest paid and original
issue discount includible in gross income after December 31,
1982.
* * * * *
     (c) * * *  (1)* * *  
     (ii) * * *
     (A)  Corporation.  A corporation, as defined in section
7701(a)(3), whether domestic or foreign, is an exempt recipient. 
In addition, for purposes of this paragraph (c)(1), the term
corporation includes a partnership all of whose members are
corporations described in this paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A), but only
if the partnership files with the payor a certificate meeting the
certification requirements set out below.  Absent actual
knowledge or reason to know otherwise, a payor may treat a payee
as a corporation (and, therefore, as an exempt recipient) if one
of the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A)(1), (2), (3), (4),
(5), or (6) of this section are met before a payment is made.
     (1)  For payments other than interest, dividends, or broker
proceeds, the name of the payee contains an unambiguous
expression of corporate status that is "Incorporated," "Inc.,"
"Corporation," "Corp.," "P.C.," (but not "Company" or "Co.") or
contains the term indemnity company, reinsurance company, or
assurance company.  
     (2)  For payments of interest, dividends or broker proceeds
that are paid to a person with whom the payor does not have an
account relationship, the payor may rely on the test of paragraph
(c)(1)(ii)(A)(1) of this section if the payor also has a mailing
address of the payee in the United States.
     (3)  The payor has on file a corporate resolution or similar
document clearly indicating corporate status.  
     (4)  The payor receives a Form W-9 which includes an EIN and
a statement from the payee that it is a domestic corporation.
     (5)  The payor receives a withholding certificate described
in 1.1441-1(e)(2), that includes an employer identification
number and a statement from the payee that it is a foreign
corporation. 
     (6)  The payor maintains an account for an entity claiming
to be a corporation and the account was established on or before
a date that is 60 days after these regulations are published as
final regulations in the Federal Register and the name of the
payee contains an unambiguous expression of corporate status that
is "Incorporated," "Inc.," "Corporation," "Corp.," or "P.C." (but
not Company or Co.), or contains the term insurance company,
indemnity company, reinsurance company, or assurance company.
* * * * *
     (G)  International organization.  An international
organization and any wholly owned agency or instrumentality
thereof are exempt recipients.  The term international
organization shall have the meaning ascribed to it in section
7701(a)(18).  Without requiring a certificate, a payor may treat
a payee as an international organization if the payee is
designated as an international organization by executive order
(pursuant to 22 U.S.C. 288 through 288(f)).
* * * * *
     Par. 36.  Section 1.6049-4 is amended by revising paragraph
(d)(3) to read as follows:
* * * * *
     (d) * * *
     (3)  Conversion into United States dollars of amounts paid
in foreign currency--(i)  Conversion rules.  When the amount
subject to reporting is paid in a currency other than the U.S.
dollar, the amount subject to reporting under this section shall
be determined by converting such foreign currency into U.S.
dollars on the date of payment at the spot rate (as defined in
1.988-1(d)(1)) or pursuant to a reasonable spot rate convention. 
For example, a withholding agent may use a month-end spot rate or
a monthly average spot rate.  A spot rate convention must be used
consistently with respect to all non-dollar amounts withheld and
from year to year.  Such convention cannot be changed without the
consent of the Commissioner or delegate.  
     (ii)  Special rule for 1.988-5(a) transactions where the
payor on both components of a qualified hedging transaction is
the same person--(A) In general.  Interest or original issue
discount on a qualified debt instrument that is part of a
qualified hedging transaction under 1.988-5(a) shall be computed
for section 6049 reporting purposes under the rules described in
1.988-5(a)(9)(ii) if--
     (1)  The payor on the qualified debt instrument and the
counterparty to the 1.988-5(a) hedge are the same person; and
     (2)  The payee complies with the requirements of 1.988-5(a)
and so notifies its payor prior to the date required for filing
Form 1099 as required by this section. 
     (B)  Effective date.  The provisions of this paragraph
(d)(3)(ii) apply to transactions entered into on or after
December 31, 1997. 
* * * * * 
     Par. 37.  Section 1.6049-5, as proposed to be amended in
project number INTL-52-86, published on February 29, 1988, at 53

outside the United States by a non-U.S. payor or a non-U.S.
middleman (as defined in paragraph (d)(2) of this section).
     (7)  Portfolio interest, as defined in 1.871-14(b)(1), paid
with respect to bearer obligations described in section
871(h)(2)(A) or 881(c)(2)(A) or with respect to a foreign-
targeted registered obligation defined in 1.6049-5(j)(4) (as
proposed in project number INTL-52-86 (1988-1 C.B. 892)) (other
than by a U.S. middleman (as defined in paragraph (d)(1) of this
section) that, as a custodian or nominee of the payee, collects
the amount for, or on behalf of, the payee, regardless of whether
the middleman is also acting as agent of the payor).
     (8)  Portfolio interest, as defined in 1.871-14(c)(1), paid
with respect to registered obligations described in section
871(h)(2)(B) or 881(c)(2)(B).
* * * * *
     (10)  Amounts paid outside the United States (other than by
a U.S. middleman (as defined in paragraph (d)(1) of this section)
that, as a custodian or nominee or other agent of the payee,
collects the amount for, or on behalf of, the payee, regardless
of whether the middleman is also acting as agent of the payor)
with respect to an obligation that: has a face amount or
principal amount of not less than $500,000; has a maturity (at
issue) of 183 days or less; satisfies the requirements of
sections 163(f)(2)(B)(i) and (ii)(I) (as if it were a
registration-required obligation within the meaning of section
163(f)(2)(A)) and is issued in accordance with the procedures of
1.163-5(c)(2)(i)(D); and has on its face the following statement
(or a similar statement having the same effect)--"By accepting
this obligation, the holder represents and warrants that it is
not a United States person (other than an exempt recipient
described in section 6049(b)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code and
regulations thereunder) and that it is not acting for or on
behalf of a United States person (other than an exempt recipient
described in section 6049(b)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code and
the regulations thereunder)."  If the obligation is in registered
form, it must be registered in the name of an exempt recipient
described in 1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii). For purposes of this paragraph
(b)(10), a middleman may treat an obligation as described in
section 163(f)(2)(B)(i) and (ii)(I) and the regulations under
that section if the obligation, or coupons detached therefrom,
whichever is presented for payment, contains the statement
described in this paragraph (b)(10). 
     (11)  Amounts paid with respect to an account or deposit
with a U.S. or foreign branch of a domestic or foreign
corporation or partnership that is paid with respect to an
obligation described in paragraph (b)(11)(i) or (ii) of this
section, if the branch is engaged in the commercial banking
business; and the interest or OID is paid outside the United
States (other than by a U.S. middleman (as defined in paragraph
(d)(1) of this section) that acts as a custodian, nominee, or
other agent of the payee, and collects the amount for, or on
behalf of, the payee, regardless of whether the middleman is also
acting as agent of the payor).
     (i)  An obligation is described in this paragraph (b)(11)(i)
if it is not in registered form (within the meaning of section
163(f) and the regulations under that section), is described in
section 163(f)(2)(B) and issued in accordance with the procedures
of 1.163-5(c)(2)(i)(C) or (D), and, in the case of a U.S.
branch, is part of a larger single public offering of securities. 
For purposes of this paragraph (b)(11)(i), a middleman may treat
an obligation as described in section 163(f)(2)(B) if the
obligation, and any detachable coupons, contains the statement
described in section 163(f)(2)(B)(ii)(II) and the regulations
under that section.  
     (ii)  An obligation is described in this paragraph
(b)(11)(ii) if it produces income described in section
871(i)(2)(A); has a face amount or principal amount of not less
than $500,000; satisfies the requirements of sections
163(f)(2)(B)(i) and (ii)(I) (as if it were a registration-
required obligation within the meaning of section 163(f)(2)(A))
and is issued in accordance with the procedures of 1.163-
5(c)(2)(i)(C) or (D); has on its face, and on any detachable
coupons, the following statement (or a similar statement having
the same effect)--"By accepting this obligation, the holder
represents and warrants that it is not a United States person
(other than an exempt recipient described in section 6049(b)(4)
of the Internal Revenue Code and regulations thereunder) and that
it is not acting for or on behalf of a United States person
(other than an exempt recipient described in section 6049(b)(4)
of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder)." 
If the obligation is in registered form, it must be registered in
the name of an exempt recipient described in 1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii). 
For purposes of this paragraph (b)(11)(ii), a middleman may treat
an obligation as described in sections 163(f)(2)(B)(i) and
(ii)(I) and the regulations under that section if the obligation,
or any detachable coupon, contains the statement described in
this paragraph (b)(11)(ii).
     (12)  Amounts that the payor may treat as paid to a
beneficial owner that is a foreign person pursuant to 1.1441-
1(e)(1) and from which the payor or middleman is either required
to withhold tax under section 1441 or the regulations under that
section or would be so required but for exceptions in the
regulations under section 1441 (such as, for example, under
1.1441-4 (dealing with effectively connected income) or 1.1441-
6 (dealing with a reduction of rate of tax under an income tax
treaty)).
     (13)  Amounts for the period that they represent an asset
blocked as described in 1.1441-2(e)(3)).  Payment of such
amounts, including interest that is past due and OID on
obligations that mature on or before the date that the assets are
no longer blocked, is deemed to occur in accordance with the
rules of 1.1441-2(e)(3).
     (14)  Amounts that are from sources outside the United
States or original issue discount on any obligation payable less
than 6 months from the date of original issue described in
section 871(g)(1)(B)(i) and that a payor or middleman may treat
as paid to a beneficial owner that is a foreign person (because
such person has furnished a certificate or documentary evidence
as required under paragraph (c) of this section).  
     (c)  Treatment of payee as a foreign person--(1)  On-shore
accounts or payments inside the U.S.  A payor or middleman making
a payment with respect to an on-shore account, as defined in
paragraph (d)(3) of this section, or making a payment inside the
United States, as defined in paragraph (e) of this section, may
treat the payment as made to a beneficial owner that is a foreign
person if it complies with the requirements under 1.1441-1(e)(1)
(dealing with reliance by a withholding agent on a beneficial
owner's claim of foreign status).  For purposes of this section,
beneficial owner shall be as defined in 1.1441-1(c)(6)(ii)(A). 
     (2)  Payments made outside the United States with respect to
off-shore accounts--(i) In general.  In the case of a payment
made outside the United States with respect to an offshore
account, as defined in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, a payor
or middleman may treat a payment as made to a beneficial owner
(as described in 1.1441-1(b)(6)) that is a foreign person if it
complies with the procedures described in paragraph (c)(1) of
this section or complies with the documentary evidence procedures
described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. 
     (ii)  Documentary evidence.  A payor or middleman complies
with the documentary evidence procedures if, prior to the
payment, the payor or middleman has established procedures to
obtain, review, and maintain documentary evidence sufficient to
establish the identity of the beneficial owner and the status of
that person as a foreign person; and the payor or middleman
obtains, reviews, and maintains such documentary evidence in
accordance with those procedures.  A payor or middleman maintains
the documents reviewed by retaining the original, certified copy,
or a photocopy of the documents reviewed and noting in its
records the date on which and by whom the document was received
and reviewed.
     (3)  Presumptions.  The presumptions of 1.1441-1(f) shall
apply for determining the payee's status where the required
documentation is lacking, incorrect, or unreliable.    
     (4)  Validity of certificates and documentary evidence.  For
rules regarding the period of validity of a withholding
certificate, see 1.1441-1(e)(4)(ii).  Documentary evidence or a
certificate that does not include a taxpayer identifying number
shall be valid for a period of three years from the date received
by the payor or middleman.  The three-year validity period shall
start from the date that the certificate is signed (or the
documentation is received) until the last day of the third
succeeding calendar year.  For example, a withholding certificate
signed on September 10, 1998, remains valid through December 31,
2001.  A beneficial owner that becomes a U.S. person must,
however, inform a payor or middleman within 30 days of change of
status. 
     (5)  Retention of withholding certificate.  A payor or
middleman must retain each withholding certificate, any
applicable documentary evidence, and any information obtained in
lieu of the withholding certificate as long as it may be relevant
to the determination of the payor's or middleman's liability
under the reporting provisions of this chapter and related
provisions.
     (6)  Standard of knowledge.  A payor or middleman may not
rely on a certificate or documentary evidence described in
paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2)(ii) of this section if it has actual
knowledge that the representations made therein or on the basis
thereof are incorrect or if any of the required information or
certifications described in 1.1441-1(f)(1)(ii) are lacking from
the certificate or documentary evidence.  
     (7)  Joint owners.  In the case of amounts paid to joint
owners and for which a certificate or documentation is required
as a condition for being exempt from reporting under this
paragraph (c), a payor or middleman must receive from each joint
owner the required certification or documentation.  Where any one
of the joint owners has not furnished the required certification
or documentation, the payment is not exempt from reporting under
this paragraph (c).
     (8)  Payee.  For determination of payee, see 1.1441-
1(c)(3).
     (d)  Definitions--(1) Payor or middleman and U.S. payor or
U.S. middleman.  For purposes of this section, the term payor
means any person who is required to make an information return
with respect to any reportable payment, as described in section
3406(b) (including any middleman).  For purposes of this section,
the term middleman means any person whose legal relationship to
the payor or payee (including any other middleman) is of a kind
described in 1.6049-4(f)(4) (as proposed in project number INTL-
52-86 published in 1988-1 C.B. 892).  Thus, a person who, from
within the United States, forwards an interest coupon or discount
obligation on behalf of a payee for presentation, collection or
payment outside the United States is also a middleman for
purposes of this section (but the transfer, although subject to
information reporting under this section, does not make the
payment subject to backup withholding under section 3406).  For
purposes of this section, the term U.S. payor or U.S. middleman
means a payor or middleman that is--
     (i)  A person described in section 7701(a)(30);
     (ii)  The government of the United States, the government of
any State or political subdivision thereof (or any agency or
instrumentality of any of the foregoing);
     (iii)  A controlled foreign corporation within the meaning
of section 957(a); or 
     (iv)  A foreign person 50 percent or more of the gross
income of which, from all sources for the three-year period
ending with the close of its taxable year preceding the
collection or payment (or such part of such period as the person
has been in existence), was effectively connected with the
conduct of trade or business within the United States.
     (2)  Non-U.S. payor or non-U.S. middleman.  A non-U.S. payor
or a non-U.S. middleman is a payor or middleman that is not a
U.S. payor or a U.S. middleman.
     (3)  On-shore and off-shore accounts. An on-shore account
means an account maintained at an office or branch of a payor or
middleman in the United States.  An offshore account means an
account that is not an on-shore account.
* * * * *
     (g)  Effective date--(1)  General rule.  The provisions of
paragraphs (b)(6) through (b)(14), (c), (d), and (e) of this
section apply to payments made after December 31, 1997.
     (2)  Transition rules.  A payor that holds a valid Form W-8
on a date that is 60 days after these regulations are published
as final regulations in the Federal Register may treat it as a
valid certificate until its validity expires under applicable
provisions as in effect on April 22, 1996.
     Par. 38. Section 1.6050N-1 is amended by:
     1.  Revising the section heading.
     2.  Redesignating paragraphs (c) and (d) as paragraphs (d)
and (e), respectively.
     3.  Adding a new paragraph (c).
     4.  Revising newly designated paragraph (e).
     The addition and revisions read as follows:
1.6050N-1  Statement to recipients of royalties paid after
December 31, 1986.  
* * * * *
     (c) Exempted foreign-related items--(1)  In general.  No
return shall be required under paragraph (a) of this section for
payments of the items described in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through
(iii) of this section.
     (i)  Returns of information are not required for payments of
royalties that a payor or middleman, as defined in paragraph
(c)(2)(i) of this section, may treat as made to a beneficial
owner that is a foreign person pursuant to 1.1441-1(e)(1) and
from which the payor or middleman is either required to withhold
tax under section 1441 or the regulations under that section or
would be so required but for exceptions in the regulations under
section 1441 (such as, for example, under 1.1441-4 (dealing with
effectively connected income) or 1.1441-6 (dealing with a
reduction of rate of tax under an income tax treaty)).  See
1.1441-1(e)(4)(i) in the case of payments to joint owners. 
     (ii)  Returns of information are not required for payments
of royalties from sources outside the United States made outside
the United States by a non-U.S. payor or non-U.S. middleman (as
defined in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section).  See 1.6049-
5(e) for circumstances in which a payment is considered to be
made outside the United States.
     (iii)  Returns of information are not required for payments
of royalties from sources outside the United States that a payor
or middleman may treat as paid to a beneficial owner that is a
foreign person (because such person has furnished a certificate
described in 1.6049-5(c)(1)).  For purposes of this paragraph
(c)(1)(iii), the presumptions in 1.6049-5(c)(3) through (6)
(regarding operating rules related to the certificate of foreign
status) shall apply.
     (2)  Definitions--(i) Payor and middleman.  For purposes of
this section, the term payor means any person who is required to
make an information return with respect to any reportable
payment, as described in section 3406(b), including any
middleman.  For purposes of this section, the term middleman
means any person whose legal relationship to the payor or payee
(including any other middleman) is of a kind described in
1.6049-4(f)(4) (as proposed in project number INTL-52-86
published in 1988-1 C.B. 892).  
     (ii)  Non-U.S. payor and non-U.S. middleman.  The term non-
U.S. payor or non-U.S. middleman means a payor or middleman other
than--
     (A)  A person described in section 7701(a)(30); 
     (B)  The government of the United States, the government of
any State or political subdivision thereof (or any agency or
instrumentality of any of the foregoing);
     (C)  A controlled foreign corporation within the meaning of
section 957(a); or 
     (D)  A foreign person 50 percent or more of the gross income
of which, from all sources for the three-year period ending with
the close of its taxable year preceding the collection or payment
(or such part of such period as the person has been in
existence), was effectively connected with the conduct of trade
or business within the United States.
     (iii)  Applicable presumptions.  The presumptions of
1.1441-1(f) shall apply for determining the payee's status where
the required documentation is lacking, incorrect, or unreliable. 
     (iv)  Joint owners.  In the case of amounts paid to joint
owners and requiring a certificate or documentation as a
condition for being exempt from reporting under this paragraph
(c), the payor or middleman must receive from each joint owner
the required certification.  Where any one of the joint owners
has not furnished the required certification, the payment is not
exempt from reporting under this section.
     (v)  Payee.  For determination of payee, see 1.1441-
1(c)(3).
* * * * *
     (e)  Effective date--(1)  General rule.  The provisions of
paragraph (c) of this section apply to payments made after
December 31, 1997.
     (2)  Transition rules.  A payor that holds a valid Form W-8
on a date that is 60 days after these regulations are published
as final regulations in the Federal Register may treat it as a
valid certificate until its validity expires under applicable
provisions as in effect on April 22, 1996.
PART 31--EMPLOYMENT TAXES AND COLLECTION OF INCOME TAX AT SOURCE
     Par. 39.  The authority for part 31 continues to read in
part as follows:
     Authority: 26 U.S.C. 7805 * * * 
     Par. 40.  Section 31.3401(a)(6)-1 is amended by:
     1.  Revising the section heading.
     2.  Revising the heading and first sentence of paragraph
(e).
     3.  Adding paragraph (f).
     4.  Removing the authority citation at the end of the
section.
     The addition and revisions read as follows:
31.3401(a)(6)-1  Remuneration for services of nonresident alien
individuals.
* * * * *
     (e)  Exemption from income tax for remuneration paid for
services performed before January 1, 1998.  Remuneration paid for
services performed within the United States by a nonresident
alien individual before January 1, 1998 is excepted from wages
and hence is not subject to withholding if such remuneration is,
or will be, exempt from income tax imposed by chapter 1 of the
Internal Revenue Code by reason of a provision of the Internal
Revenue Code or an income tax convention to which the United
States is a party.* * *
     (f)  Exemption from income tax for remuneration paid for
services performed after December 31, 1997.  Remuneration paid
for services performed within the United States by a nonresident
alien individual after December 31, 1997 is excepted from wages
and hence is not subject to withholding if such remuneration is,
or will be, exempt from the income tax imposed by chapter 1 of
the Internal Revenue Code by reason of a provision of the
Internal Revenue Code or an income tax convention to which the
United States is a party.  An employer may rely on a claim that
the employee is entitled to an exemption from tax if it complies
with the requirements of 1.1441-1(e)(1) of this chapter (for a
claim based on a provision of the Internal Revenue Code) or
1.1441-4(b)(2) of this chapter (for a claim based on an income
tax convention). 
     Par. 41.  In 31.3406(d)-3, paragraph (c) is revised to read
as follows:
31.3406(d)-3 Special 30-day rules for certain reportable
payments.
* * * * *
     (c)  Application to foreign payees.  The rules of paragraphs
(a) and (b) of this section also apply to a payee from whom the
payor is required to obtain a Form W-8 (or an acceptable 
substitute) or is to obtain other evidence of foreign status
(pursuant to relevant regulations under an applicable Internal
Revenue Code section), provided the payee represents orally or
otherwise, before or at the time of the acquisition or sale of
the instrument or the establishment of the account, that the
payee is not a United States citizen or resident.  In the case of
a payment made after December 31, 1997, to a person with respect
to whom indicia of foreign ownership exists, as described in
1.1441-1(f)(2)(ii)(A) of this chapter, at any time before
expiration of the 30-day grace period described in this paragraph
(c), the procedures described in that section shall apply,
including the special grace period.  The 30-day and 90-day grace
periods shall run concurrently.  Therefore, for example, if
indicia of foreign ownership were provided on the 28th day after
a payment is credited to an account, the 30-day grace period
would convert to a 90-day grace period under 1.1441-
1(f)(2)(ii)(A) of this chapter, of which 28 days would have
already elapsed. 
     Par. 42.  In 31.3406(g)-1, paragraph (e) is added to read
as follows:
31.3406(g)-1 Exception for payments to certain payees and
certain other payments.
* * * * * 
     (e)  Certain reportable payments made outside the United
States by foreign persons, foreign offices of United States banks
and brokers, and others.  A payor of a reportable payment or
transfer is not required to backup withhold under section 3406 if
such reportable payment or transfer is of a kind that is exempt
from reporting if documentary evidence described in 1.6049-
5(2)(ii) of this chapter is provided to the payor, unless the
payor has actual knowledge that the payee is a United States
person.  In addition, amounts paid with respect to notional

payee is a United States person.

     1.  Removing the heading of paragraph (e)(1).

31.3406(h)-2  Special rules.
     (a) * * *
     (3)  Joint foreign payees--(i)  In general.  If the relevant
payee listed on an account or instrument provides the penalties
of perjury statement regarding its foreign status, withholding
under section 3406 applies unless--
     (A)  Every joint payee provides the statement regarding
foreign status (under the provisions of chapter 3 and chapter 61
of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations under those
provisions); or
     (B)  Any one of the joint owners who has not established
foreign status provides a taxpayer identifying number to the
payor in the manner required in 31.3406(d)-1.
* * * * *
     Par. 44.  Section 31.6413(a)-3 is amended as follows:
     1. In paragraph (a)(1)(iii), the language "(including the
certification relating to foreign status described in 1.6049-
5(b)(2)(iv) of this chapter or 1.6045-1(g)(1) of this chapter)" 
is removed and "(including the documentation required under
1.1441-1(e)(1), 1.6045-1(g)(3), and 1.6049-5(c) of this
chapter)" is added in its place.
     2.   Paragraph (a)(1)(ii) is amended by removing "or" at the
end of the paragraph and paragraph (a)(1)(iii) is amended by

in its place.
     3.   Paragraph (a)(1)(iv) is added.
     4.   Paragraphs (a)(2) and (b)(2) are revised.
     The addition and revisions read as follows:
31.6413(a)-3  Repayment by payor of tax erroneously collected
from payee.
     (a)  * * *  (1)  * * *
     (iv)  The amount is withheld because a payor imposed backup
withholding on a payment made to a person because the payee
failed to furnish the required documentation described in
1.1441-1(e)(1), 1.6045-1(g)(3), and 1.6049-5(c) of this chapter
and the payee subsequently furnishes, completes, or corrects the
required documentation.  The required documentation must be
furnished, completed, or corrected prior to the end of the
calendar year in which the payment is made and prior to the time
the payor furnishes a Form 1099 to the payee with respect to the
payment for which the withholding erroneously occurred.
     (2)  For purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section (other
than erroneous withholding occurring under the circumstances
described in paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section), if a payor or
broker withholds because the payor or broker has not received a
taxpayer identifying number or required certification and the
payee subsequently provides a taxpayer identifying number or a
required certification to the payor, the payor or broker may not
refund the amount to the payee.
     (b)  * * *
     (2)  Adjustment after the deposit of the tax--(i)  In
general.  Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this
section, if the amount erroneously withheld has been deposited
prior to the time that the refund is made to the payee, the payor
or broker may adjust any subsequent deposit of the tax collected
under chapter 24 of the Internal Revenue Code that the payor or
broker is required to make in the amount of the tax that has been
refunded to the payee.
     (ii)  Erroneous withholding from a payee that is a foreign
person.  Where a payor withholds in error from a payee that is a
nonresident alien or foreign person, as described in paragraph
(b)(1) of this section, the payor may refund some or all of the
amount subject to backup withholding under section 3406.  A
refund may be paid in accordance with the requirements of this
paragraph (b)(2)(ii) where the required documentation is
furnished, completed, or corrected prior to the end of the
calendar year in which the payment is made and prior to the time
the payor furnishes a Form 1099 to the payee with respect to the
payment for which the withholding erroneously occurred.  The
amount of the refund will be the amount erroneously withheld less
the amount of tax required to be withheld, if any, under chapter
3 of the Internal Revenue Code.  With respect to the amount of
the payment to the foreign person and the amount of tax required
to be withheld under chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code,
returns must be made in accordance with the requirements of
1.1461-1(b) and (c) of this chapter.

document must furnish such taxpayer identifying numbers of other
U.S. persons and foreign persons that are described in paragraph
(b)(2)(i), (ii), (iii), or (v) of this section as required by the

identifying number of any person furnishing a withholding
certificate referred to in paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section
shall also be furnished if it is actually known to the person
making a return, statement, or other document described in this
paragraph (c).  If the person making the return, statement, or
other document does not know the taxpayer identifying number of
the other person, and such other person is one that is described
in paragraph (b)(2)(i), (ii), (iii), or (v) of this section, such
person must request the other person's number.  The request
should state that the identifying number is required to be
furnished under authority of law.  When the person making the

the other person, and has complied with the request provision of
this paragraph (c), such person must sign an affidavit on the
transmittal document  forwarding such returns, statements, or
other documents to the Internal Revenue Service, so stating.  A
person required to file a taxpayer identifying number shall
correct any errors in such filing when such person's attention
has been drawn to them.

be filed, a return must nevertheless be filed for purposes of
making the disclosure required by this section.  For this
purpose, such return need include only the taxpayer's name,
address, taxpayer identifying number, and be signed under the
penalties of perjury (as well as the subject disclosure).  Also,
the taxpayer's taxable year shall be deemed to be the calendar
year (unless the taxpayer has previously established, or timely
chooses for this purpose to establish, a different taxable year). 
In the case of a disclosable return position relating solely to
income subject to withholding (as defined in 1.1441-2(a) of this
chapter), however, the statement required to be filed in
paragraph (d) of this section must instead be filed at times and

related to the person obligated to pay the income within the
meaning of sections 267(b) and 707(b), and the income exceeds

requirements of the limitation on benefits article of the treaty;
or
     (D)  For payments made after December 31, 1997, with respect
to a treaty that imposes any other conditions for the entitlement

dividends, or royalty article, that such conditions are met;

* * * * *
     (e)  In the case of a nonresident alien individual or
foreign corporation, the appropriate income tax return on which
the claim for refund or credit is made must contain the tax
identification number of the taxpayer required pursuant to
section 6109 and the entire amount of income of the taxpayer
subject to tax, even if the tax liability for that income was
fully satisfied at source through withholding under chapter 3 of
the Internal Revenue Code.  Also, if the overpayment of tax
resulted from the withholding of tax at source under chapter 3 of
the Internal Revenue Code, a copy of the Form 1042-S required to
be provided to the beneficial owner pursuant to 1.1461-
1(c)(1)(i) of this chapter must be attached to the return.  For
purposes of claiming a refund, the Form 1042-S must include the
taxpayer identifying number of the beneficial owner even if not
otherwise required.  No claim of refund or credit under chapter
65 may be made by the taxpayer for any amount that the
withholding agent has repaid to the taxpayer pursuant to 1.1461-
2(a)(2) of this chapter or that was subject to a set-off pursuant
to 1.1461-2(a)(3) of this chapter.  Upon request, a taxpayer
must also submit such documentation as the Commissioner (or
delegate), the District Director, or the Assistant Commissioner
(International), may require establishing that the taxpayer is
the beneficial owner of the income for which a claim of refund or
credit is being made.
