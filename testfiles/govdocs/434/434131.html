<H3>Abstract:</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE> 
  <P> Survivor involves high school sophomore students in a decision-making project 
    enabling them to demonstrate how they would deal with an impending cataclysmic 
    event without the initial benefit of adult expertise. Students will engage 
    in creative, meaningful, and challenging classroom academic options involving 
    exploration using technology. Students will direct their learning, via group 
    discussions with the resulting outcomes of creating a diorama, PowerPoint 
    Presentation or a simulation game of a survival scenario, which demonstrates 
    their understanding of the essentials of survival. Their survival exploration 
    and escape adventure will require detailed accounts of how they survived through 
    the creation of a new habitat. Their success depends upon showing/demonstrating 
    how they used technology to contact experts as well as actual survivors of 
    cataclysmic events and setup a mechanism to deal with complicated dramatic 
    changes that may affect their values and beliefs. </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Learner Description/Environment:</H3>

<p> Vallejo High School is located in the city of Vallejo, California. An evolving 
  city of 112,000 culturally and ethnically diverse people, Vallejo is best described 
  as: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Former home to Mare Island Naval Shipyard</li>
  <li> Reestablishing its industrial base since the closure of Mare Island; 16,000 
    jobs lost </li>
  <li>Having changing community demographics </li>
  <li>Being located 30 miles north of San Francisco </li>
  <li>Attempting to develop sources of employment </li>
  <li>Attempting to increase the effectiveness of its educational system in meeting 
    the needs of a changing student population. </li>
</ul>
<BLOCKQUOTE> 
  <P>Data collected from the Vision 2020 Report, surveys of students, parents, 
    teachers, staff, and community members, discussions from a community Digital 
    High School (DHS) forum, and the WASC process all point toward parents wanting 
    their students to have more creative, meaningful, and challenging classroom 
    academic options involving technology. The perception prevails that students 
    should perceive academic subjects as being sources of career information and 
    acquiring job skills as well as the foundation for acquiring college preparatory 
    skills. Vallejo High School's goal is to create an environment where collaborating, 
    communicating, and critical thinking are enhanced through the use of the tools 
    of technology. </P>
  <P>The English, World History, and Science teachers will guide the students 
    in this project. The students also may consult with experts in the field of 
    aviation, other students, as well as access print and non-print information 
    through Internet and library research. Students will utilize the one-computer 
    classrooms and will also have access to the on-line computer lab located in 
    the library where scanners, in-focus projectors, and digital cameras are available. 
  </P>
  <P>The World History and Science teachers have use of a TV, a VCR, and one computer 
    with Internet Connection in their rooms. The English teacher is located in 
    a portable classroom. No computer, TV, or VCR is available to her. She will 
    make arrangements with other teachers to switch rooms when she wants to use 
    existing technology tools. This pilot year would consist of same thirty-two 
    students in these three disciplines. </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Time Frame:</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE> 
  <P> <b>Project Timeline: 10 Weeks</b></P>
  <P>A pilot interdisciplinary unit in English II, Modern World History, and Science 
    II will explore student decision-making during this ten week unit. The same 
    thirty-two students will be involved in the three classes.</P>
  <P> <b>Introduction (Two weeks): </b></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<ul>
  <li><b>English:</b> Reading of the core novel "Tangerine". Exploration of transitions 
    and how individual students deal with them. </li>
  <li><b>Modern World History</b>: Based on students level of interested show 
    a disaster film like Deep Space, Asteroid, Tornado, etc. Introduce past cataclysms 
    that have changed societies. Students contact survivors of current cataclysms 
    through use of the Internet.</li>
  <li><b>Science:</b> URL bibliography constructed about any type of global disaster. 
    Review of the Solar System and conditions necessary for life. Examine extinction 
    theories and continental drift. </li>

<BLOCKQUOTE> 
  <P><b>Body (Six Weeks) </b></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<ul>
  <li><b>English:</b> Read and interpret core novel "Tangerine" with selected 
    parts students break into triads for evaluation and interpretation sessions. 
    Students will do daily on-line journal writing. Students will begin storyboards 
    of PowerPoint Presentations and possible simulation game scenarios. </li>
  <li><b>Modern World History:</b> Student make presentations on past cataclysms 
    that have changed society. Students establish contact with people throughout 
    the world who have survived cataclysms. Students write speculative history 
    in their on-line journals. Weekly current catastrophic events will be publicized 
    and analyzed with regards to survival actions taken or preventative measures 
    that could have been taken. </li>
  <li><b>Science:</b> Students learn survival techniques in CPR and First Aid 
    classes. Students conduct habitat research. Students form into similar interest 
    groups and determine what they would do when presented with unfamiliar circumstances. 
    They will make presentations to the class using a technology component. </li>
</ul>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><b>Conclusion (Two Weeks)</b></P>
  <P> Cooperative production of a diorama, multimedia project, or simulation game 
    in all three classes. Multiple class periods will be spent in the campus "sign-up" 
    computer lab. Students will finalize their on-line journal. A final assessment 
    will engage students in a new disaster situation to determine how much they 
    have learned from their previous survival knowledge. </P>

<H4>Authentic Student Task:</H4>

<BLOCKQUOTE> 
  <P>Students will decide how to deal with an impending cataclysmic event without 
    the initial benefit of adult expertise. </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p><b>Hook:</b></p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Students read an <a href="hookpage.htm">excerpt from the novel Tangerine</a>. 
    Students imagine themselves transplanted students from Texas living in south 
    Florida. How would they react to such an emergency? How would other students 
    react to the same situation? The students will conduct a poll of the other 
    students in their class to determine how they would react to this situation. 
    What other types of natural disasters or events could threaten their own survival? 
    What popular films have they seen that depict disasterous events on a global 
    scale? Students will analyze a protagonist's emotional reaction to the sinkhole 
    emergency. Students will conduct an opinion poll as to how other students 
    would react in the same situation. Students will then be asked what type of 
    events would threaten their survival here at Vallejo High School. Students 
    can suggest various popular films or documentaries that depict disastrous 
    events on a global scale. </P>

    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><b>Final collective assessment</b> (This will be graded by all three teachers.) 
    <ol>
      <li>Students will create a diorama (vital or physical) and their explorations 
        in a multimedia explanation of this escape habitat. Students can decide 
        to work alone or in groups up to three in a group. </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Some students may decide to create an expanded simulation game to demonstrate 
      their learning in this project. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <li><b>Beyond: </b> 
    <ol>
      <li>The students will take their journal and create a PowerPoint or a simulation 
        game that they would role play. The emphasis is that students would move 
        beyond just text but would incorporate URLs, links, CPR, First Aid, and 
        make use of contacts with experts who have survived disasters.</li>

  of proof (e.g., statistics, testimony, specific instances) that meet standard 
  tests for evidence, including credibility, validity, and relevance. </p>
<p>1.7 Use props, visual aids, graphs, and electronic media to enhance the appeal 
  and accuracy of presentations. </p>
<p><b>Analysis and Evaulation of Oral and Media Communications</b> (Grades Nine 
  and Ten) Using the speaking strategies of grades nine and ten outlined in Listening 
  and Speaking Standard 1.0, students: </p>
<p>2.1. Deliver narrative presentations: a. Narrate a sequence of events and communicate 
  their significance to the audience. b. Locate scenes and incidents in specific 
  places. c. Describe with concrete sensory details the sights, sounds, and smells 
  of a scene and the specific actions, movements, gestures, and feelings of characters. 
  d. Pace the presentation of actions to accommodate time or mood changes. </p>
<p>2.2 Deliver expository presentations: a. Marshal evidence in support of a thesis 
  and related claims, including information on all relevant perspectives. b. Convey 
  information and ideas from primary and secondary sources accurately and coherently. 
  c. Make distinctions between the relative value and significance of specific 
  data, facts, and ideas. d. Include visual aids by employing appropriate technology 
  to organize and display information on charts, maps, and graphs. e. Anticipate 
  and address the listener's potential misunderstandings, biases, and expectations. 
  f. Use technical terms and notations accurately. </p>
<p>2.3 Apply appropriate interviewing techniques: a. Prepare and ask relevant 
  questions. b. Make notes of responses. c. Use language that conveys maturity, 
  sensitivity, and respect. d. Respond correctly and effectively to questions. 
  e. Demonstrate knowledge of the subject or organization. f. Compile and report 
  responses. g. Evaluate the effectiveness of the interview. </p>
<p><b><font size="4">Science Standards</font></b> </p>
<p><b>Physics Motion and Forces </b></p>
<p>1. Newton's laws predict the motion of most objects. Conservation of Energy 
  and Momentum </p>
<p>2. The laws of conservation of energy and momentum provide a way to predict 
  and describe the movement of objects. Heat and Thermodynamics </p>
<p>3. Energy cannot be created or destroyed although in many processes energy 
  is transferred to the environment as heat. </p>
<p><b>Chemistry Nuclear Processes</b> </p>
<p>11. Nuclear processes are those in which an atomic nucleus changes, including 
  radioactive decay of naturally occurring and man-made isotopes, nuclear fission, 
  and nuclear fusion. As a basis for understanding this concept, students know: 
  a. protons and neutrons in the nucleus are held together by strong nuclear forces 
  which are stronger than the electromagnetic repulsion between the protons. b. 
  the energy release per gram of material is much larger in nuclear fusion or 
  fission reactions than in chemical reactions: change in mass (calculated by 
  E=mc^2) is small but significant in nuclear reactions. </p>
<p><b>Biology/Life Sciences Cell Biology </b></p>
<p>1. Fundamental life processes of plants and animals depend on a variety of 
  chemical reactions that are carried out in specialized areas of the organism's 
  cells. </p>
<p><b>Ecology </b></p>
<p>6. Stability in an ecosystem is a balance between competing effects. As a basis 
  for understanding this concept, students know: a. biodiversity is the sum total 
  of different kinds of organisms, and is affected by alterations of habitats. 
  b. how to analyze changes in an ecosystem resulting from changes in climate, 
  human activity, introduction of non-native species, or changes in population 
  size. c. how water, carbon, and nitrogen cycle between abiotic resources and 
  organic matter in the ecosystem and how oxygen cycles via photosynthesis and 
  respiration. d. a vital part of an ecosystem is the stability of its producers 
  and decomposers. e. at each link in a food web, some energy is stored in newly 
  made structures but much is dissipated into the environment as heat and this 
  can be represented in a food pyramid. </p>
<p><b>Earth Sciences Earth's Place in the Universe </b></p>
<p>1. Astronomy and planetary exploration reveal the structure, scale, and change 
  of the solar system over time. As a basis for understanding this concept, students 
  know: a. how the differences and similarities among the sun, the terrestrial 
  planets, and the gas planets may have been established during the formation 
  of the solar system. b. evidence from Earth and moon rocks for the solar system's 
  formation from a nebular cloud of dust and gas approximately4.6 billion years 
  ago. c. evidence from geological studies of the Earth and other planets that 
  the early Earth was very different from today. d. evidence that the planets 
  are much closer than the stars. e. the sun is a typical star and is powered 
  by nuclear reactions, primarily the fusion of hydrogen to form helium. f. evidence 
  for the dramatic effects of asteroid impacts in shaping the surface of planets 
  and their moons, and in mass extinctions of life on Earth. g.* evidence for 
  the existence of planets orbiting other stars. </p>
<p>2. Earth-based and space-based astronomy reveals the structure, scale, and 
  change over time of stars, galaxies and the universe. </p>
<p><b>Energy in the Earth System</b> </p>
<p>4. Energy enters the Earth system primarily as solar radiation and eventually 
  escapes as heat. As a basis for understanding this concept, students know: a. 
  the relative amount of incoming solar energy compared with Earth's internal 
  energy and the energy used by society. b. the fate of incoming solar radiation 
  in terms of reflection, absorption, and photosynthesis. c. the different atmospheric 
  gases that absorb the Earth's thermal radiation, and the mechanism and significance 
  of the greenhouse effect. </p>
<p>5. Heating of Earth's surface and atmosphere by the sun drives convection within 
  the atmosphere and oceans, producing winds and ocean currents. </p>
<p><b>Investigation and Experimentation</b> </p>
<p>1. Scientific progress is made by asking meaningful questions and conducting 
  careful investigations. As a basis for understanding this concept, and to address 
  the content the other four strands, students should develop their own questions 
  and perform investigations. Students will: d. formulate explanations using logic 
  and evidence. g. recognize the use and limitations of models and theories as 
  scientific representations of reality. m. investigate a science-based societal 
  issue by researching the literature, analyzing data, and communicating the findings. 
  n. know that when an observation does not agree with an accepted scientific 
  theory, sometimes the observation is mistaken or fraudulent. </p>
