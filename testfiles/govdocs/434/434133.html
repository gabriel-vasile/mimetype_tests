                                 <p>The Internal Revenue Code requires all taxpayers to keep adequate records.
                                    There are times, due to unusual circumstances, when records do not exist.
                                    In such cases, oral testimony may be the only evidence available. Therefore,
                                    oral statements made by taxpayers to examiners represent direct evidence which
                                    must be thoroughly considered. Although self-serving, uncontradicted statements
                                    which are not improbable or unreasonable should not be disregarded. The degree
                                    of reliability placed on a taxpayer&#8217;s oral statements must be based
                                    on the credibility of the taxpayer and surrounding circumstantial evidence
                                    (IRM 4.10.7.3.10 below). The following general guidelines should also be considered:

                                    be resolved through litigation and should use formal written statements such
                                    as affidavits to record taxpayer or third party statements. An affidavit is
                                    an attested statement and has great validity when properly prepared and voluntarily
                                    given. Affidavits should be completed using Form 2311. Affidavits may be used:

                                    Hearsay often leads to primary sources of information.

                                    or third party&#8217;s credibility as part of the evaluation of oral evidence.
                                    Corroborative or contradictory details will have an important bearing on determining

                                    However, examiners should avoid taking any action that would give the taxpayer
                                    a safe haven. As an alternative, examiners should limit the number of returns
                                    examined. This approach minimizes the potential tax liability, while avoiding
                                    the likelihood of giving the taxpayer a safe haven.

                                    and resolved on a consistent basis. The purpose of Coordinated Issues is to
                                    provide examiners with guidance on significant national issues that are not
                                    being resolved consistently. Coordinated issues establish uniform positions
                                    within industry or issue areas. Examiners cannot deviate from such positions
                                    without the concurrence of the responsible LMSB Industry/Issue Team. See IRM
                                    4.40.1.1.1.8 for more information on Industry/Issue teams.

                                 the taxpayer should feel more involved in the audit process and will be better
                                 informed of the status of the examination. The examiner should discuss the

                                          possible, the examiner should prepare an audit report at the conclusion of
                                          the appointment and discuss audit issues with the taxpayer and/or representative

                                          Each issue is discussed as it is completed and resolved so that at the conclusion
                                          of field work the status of each issue is known. The examiner can then take

                                    The taxpayer should be informed that the report will be revised or voided

                                       Mediation (FTM) program. All examiners must offer taxpayers the opportunity
                                       to use FTM on all unagreed cases that meet the criteria as described in Publication
                                       3605. FTM is designed to expedite the resolution of disputes with taxpayers.
                                       A key feature of this program is the recognition of taxpayers as customers
                                       who are entitled to have their disputes handled as expeditiously as possible.
                                       FTM involves an appeals or settlement officer who has been trained in mediation
                                       techniques acting as a mediator between the taxpayer and Compliance.

                                 <p>In the examination of large, complex tax returns, numerous issues will
                                    likely be proposed. Adjustments need to be fully developed before they are
                                    presented to taxpayers for review. If adjustments are not adequately developed,
                                    the review process may take longer. Records should be maintained of proposed

                                    adjustment. Form 5701 may serve as a cover sheet for a Form 886A, Explanation
                                    of Items. This facilitates incorporation of an explanation of the issue into

                                 <p>The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA) changed
                                    examination and administrative procedures for partnership examinations. The
                                    Sub-Chapter 5 Revision Act of 1982 made similar revisions to S corporations.
                                    Under the 1982 Acts, examinations, appeals, and judicial proceedings are,
                                    in general, conducted at the entity level. Closing conferences and issue proposals
                                    relating to TEFRA entities must by law follow rigid guidelines. Refer to the
                                    Tax Shelter/TEFRA Handbook for a complete discussion of TEFRA examinations

                                 determined the policy of Examination is that the general burden of proof provisions
                                 should apply to all Examination determinations of Federal tax liability. The
                                 proper identification, development, proposal and resolution of as many issues
                                 as possible is a good examination practice.

                                       to IRC section 7491. If the taxpayer meets the conditions of IRC section 6201(d),
                                       the Service has the burden of producing information to support income items

                                       			 in any court proceeding regarding
                                       a deficiency based on an information return if: (1) the taxpayer raises a
                                       reasonable dispute and (2) the taxpayer has fully cooperated with the Service.
                                       Full cooperation includes timely compliance with requests for information,
                                       including access to witnesses and documents within the control of the taxpayer.
                                       If the taxpayer does not raise a "reasonable dispute"

                                    <p>It should be noted that relatively few audits result in litigation,
                                       the outcome of tax litigation rarely turns on who has the burden of proof,
                                       and those cases where the taxpayer refuses to provide documents and refuses
                                       to cooperate are not affected at all by IRC section 7491(a). However, this
                                       does not mean examiners should not follow sound audit practices.

                                       in some situations. If the Service has some direct or indirect evidence that
                                       links the taxpayer to unreported income generating activities, the burden
                                       of proof does not shift to the Service under this specific burden of proof.
                                       When this supplemental evidence is present, then the general burden of proof
                                       rule applies.

                                       of Proof legislation. That section of the IRM discusses what an examiner should

                                 <p>IRC section 7491(c) states that the Service now has the burden of production
                                    in a court proceeding when the issue is a penalty, an addition to tax, or
                                    an additional amount imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. In any court proceeding,
                                    the IRS must first present evidence that imposition of the amount is appropriate.
                                    Only then must the taxpayer assume the burden of persuasion to raise appropriate
                                    defenses, such as reasonable cause, to the imposition of the penalty. IRC
                                    section 7491(c) applies only to individuals.

                                       then the taxpayer&#8217;s responsibility to present evidence of reasonable
                                       cause, substantial authority, or other similar defense in showing that the
                                       amount should not be asserted.

                                       filing date was after the due date for the tax return, and that there was
                                       no evidence the taxpayer filed for an extension.
