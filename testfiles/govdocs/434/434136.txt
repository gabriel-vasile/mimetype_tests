S. officials said, either the Avalon or the Mystic could have been flown to a Russian port by Monday and carried to the Kursk by a Russian cargo ship.One concern was whether the hatches on the U.S. craft would have fit tightly enough with the hatches on the Russian submarine. Another was whether the Kursk was leaning too far toward one side for the rescue craft to connect to it.But after Russian officials finally requested international help on Wednesday, Great Britain dispatched a smaller rescue submarine. It is expected to reach the Kursk on Saturday.

66.8 4 vital NYT20000821.0468 Russian officials' assertions on Monday that the Kursk sank after a collision, most likely with a foreign submarine, echoed the kind of suspicions that were common during the Cold War, when on more than a dozen occasions, Russian and Western submarines banged into one another.The Russians have long resented the fact that many of the collisions occurred in or near their waters and, in their view, amounted to hit-and-run jobs, as American and British spy subs quickly fled to safety. One Russian submarine was so badly damaged after colliding with an American boat in 1970 that it almost sank, the Russian navy contends.Pentagon officials have repeatedly denied that any American submarine collided with the Kursk, which plunged to the seabed on Aug. 12. An intense rescue operation ended on Monday when the Russians concluded that all 118 sailors had died in the wreckage.U.S. officials have said that two American submarines were in the Barents Sea to monitor a Russian naval exercise that included the Kursk. But they have said that neither submarine was close to the Russian vessel. British officials also denied any involvement on Monday, saying they had no submarines in the Barents Sea.Since the Cold War ended, the tenor of the cat-and-mouse game, in which the submarines chased one another to test the other side's capabilities, has grown less aggressive.American officials even called Russian leaders to apologize shortly after each of the last two collisions occurred, in the early 1990s.

73.7 2 vital APW19981228.1111 How does online drug ordering work?Customers first type their credit-card information into a computer.They're typically asked to waive the site's liability if they experience health problems. Then they fill out a questionnaire of health information.The Viagra sites alone differ dramatically in what health questions they ask, and what prices they charge.One site asks one question only: Do you take nitroglycerin or other ``nitrates''? Taking Viagra with those drugs can kill. But other health problems, including heart disease, recent heart attacks or abnormal blood pressure, also can make Viagra risky. Another site asks about those additional health problems, including whether would-be Viagra users recently had a ``myocardial infarction'' _ a heart attack.U.S. sites typically charge a ``consultation fee'' for a doctor to read those questionnaires, an effort to fulfill requirements that only doctors prescribe medication. The sites waive that fee if the doctor denies the customer the drug. If the drug is shipped, the customer pays the consultation fee, anywhere from dlrs 35 to dlrs 85, plus the drug's cost _ at one U.S. site, dlrs 105 for 10 Viagra pills.Foreign sites typically say they don't require a prescription _ hence no consultation fee and fewer health questions. One Viagra site advertises a trial-run of just two Viagra tablets for dlrs 58. Another advertises 30 Viagra pills for dlrs 620.Viagra typically sells in regular U.S. pharmacies for dlrs 8 to dlrs 10 a pill

Last month, Pfizer Inc. reported Viagra sales of $141 million worldwide for the third quarter _ about a third of Viagra's $411 million sales in the second quarter.Dr. Larry Litscher, a Dayton urologist and a faculty member of Wright State University School of Medicine, isn't surprised. He says Viagra could never have lived up to its early hype as the first oral medication for impotence.``You had to be living in a cave at the time not to have heard about Viagra,'' he said. ``The result is that every man who ever had a problem (with impotence) asked for the drug when it first came out,'' whether it might work for him or not.Many patients were soon disappointed with

Holton transferred to the University of Illinois because it had an engineering program that DePauw lacked, and Miss Clark dropped out to be with him.They were married in 1930 and, according to DePauw president Robert Bottoms, always felt a strong connection to the university.Holton went on to become president and chief executive of Inland Container Corp., a corrugated box company in Indianapolis, in 1963, before becoming its vice chairman in 1970. He retired in 1975.It was around this time that Holton first began writing an annual letter to the university, expressing a desire to create scholarships for Midwestern students with a small trust that he intended to leave to DePauw after he and his wife had died, Bottoms said.The couple's only child, Jane, died in 1974 at the age of 38. She had no children.DePauw, a liberal arts institution in Greencastle, in west-central Indiana, has an enrollment of 2,334. Although the gift ranks among the 10 largest to an American university, it is dwarfed by the gift believed to lead that list: $300 million in stock from the Ingram Charitable Fund to Vanderbilt University last year.When Bottoms became president of DePauw in 1986, he said Holton estimated the value of the trust at about $1.5 million.After Holton died in 1995, a month shy of his 88th birthday, the trust reverted to his wife. When she died in 1997, at 90, the university was told that the trust was worth about $18 million, Bottoms said.Soon after, though, Bottoms said he was stunned to learn that DePauw had been named as the beneficiary of half of the Holtons' estate, much of it invested in Time-Warner stock that Holton had first received when his company was bought by Time Inc. in 1978, before being spun off in 1983.At the time of Mrs. Holton's death, the full estate was valued at $125 million, Bottoms said.But in the two years it has taken to transfer half of the estate to DePauw, the value of Time-Warner stock has climbed, doubling the estate's value.The university's share, Bottoms said, was ultimately $128 million _ enough to pay for 75 scholarships a year.The scholarships are to be awarded on the basis of need, as well as merit, to students from Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin and Ohio

75.8 6 okay APW19990125.0320 NEW YORK (AP)-- Shares of drugmaker Merck & Co. continued downward Monday due to investor disappointment over a research setback involving an experimental antidepressant.Merck disclosed Friday that it was delaying the final stage of testing for the drug, known as MK-869, after small human studies showed it offered no improvement compared with a dummy pill. Merck shares fell $7.31 1/4 after the announcement Friday. On Monday, CIBC Oppenheimer downgraded the firm's investment rating on Merck from a strong buy to a buy. The stock dropped another $1.50 Monday to $137.50 in the New York Stock Exchange trading.Some analysts had hoped MK-869, would have helped protect Merck from the rash of patent expirations involving its major drugs in the next three years. The expirations will likely cause a flood of cheaper generic medicines and erode Merck's sales.MK-869 was also expected to shake up the $7 billion antidepressant market, now dominated by Eli Lilly's Prozac and Pfizer's Zoloft.Merck, based in Whitehouse Station, N.J., said it was evaluating its options related to MK-869. Merck initially expected to start final stage of human testing this year. Those plans have now been placed on hold.``This delay is clearly a major negative for Merck's stock,'' said Mariola Haggar, analyst with Deutsche Bank Securities.The problem with MK-869 places more pressure on Merck's other expected blockbuster, Vioxx, a drug for pain relief, she said. The Food and Drug Administration is expected to approve Vioxx later this year.Merck said it still plans to move ahead with studies to use MK-869 to help prevent nausea in chemotherapy patients

Under Oregon law, the 17-year-old Kinkel could have been sentenced to as few as 25 years or as many as 220, experts say.Reports say Kinkel, in September, pleaded guilty and agreed to serve at least 25 years in prison for the murders, plus whatever the judge might be added. The judge crafted a combination of concurrent and consecutive sentences that added up to 111 years and 8 months.Kinkel's rampage began on May 20, 1998, after he was expelled from school for having a stolen pistol in his locker. He shot and killed his parents, teachers Bill and Faith Kinkel, then spent the night planting booby-trap bombs around their bodies.The next morning, dressed in a long trench coat, he walked into the cafeteria just before classes began and calmly pulled a.22- caliber semiautomatic rifle from his coat. Firing from his hip, he squeezed off 50 rounds in just 90 seconds.Ben Walker, 16, and Mikael Nickolauson, 17, were killed and 25 people were wounded. The shooting ended when several boys tackled Kinkel as he tried to reload.The shooting spree was one of a string of deadly U.S. school attacks including a massacre at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo this year that left 15 people dead, including the two gunmen

The excerpts were made public in court documents Tuesday.Kinkel, 15 at the time of the shootings, has been in the Lane County Jail since his 16th birthday. He is charged with 58 counts, including four counts of aggravated murder.In the documents, Bolstad asked Kinkel about his relationship with his parents, Bill and Faith Kinkel. ``I had to be 100 percent,'' Kinkel said. ``No one is perfect, though. Lots of times, life sucked. With my parents, if I didn't do the best, I was an embarrassment to my parents.''Concerning the Thurston shootings, Kinkel told Bolstad, ``I knew people would be in cafeteria. Just started shooting.''According to the documents, Kinkel also told Bolstad that when he learned of the April shootings in Littleton, Colo., ``I flipped out. Started blaming myself.''Mortimore referred to Kinkel's statements in legal arguments over the prosecution's attempt to retain noted forensic psychiatrist Dr. Park Dietz.Mortimore indicated in the documents that the Kinkel excerpts were intended to give the judge a sample of the kind of information Dietz, who has taken part in the cases of John Hinckley, Jeffrey Dahmer and others, has reviewed in preparing to examine Kinkel for prosecutors.Kinkel's lawyers claim they discussed Kinkel's case ``in some detail'' with Dietz's staff and that the law doesn't allow Dietz to now work for the prosecution. In sworn statements to the court, however, Dietz and two staff members denied discussing Kinkel's case with defense lawyers.Lane County Circuit Judge Jack Mattison is expected to rule Thursday on whether Dietz may testify for the prosecution

82.6 9 okay APW20000505.0169 A peanut gallery of lawyers and reporters watched on Friday as an art museum and the family of a Howdy Doody puppeteer argued over who gets custody of TV's freckle-faced marionette.The Detroit Institute of Arts claimed that puppeteer Rufus Rose promised to give the original Howdy Doody to the museum. The Rose family argued that no such promise was ever made and that the puppet they have may not even be the original.Several copies of Howdy Doody were made, including a stunt ''Double Doody.'' The puppet in question, estimated to be worth $50,000, is being stored in a bank vault in Rhode Island.U.S. District Judge Christopher Droney gave lawyers two weeks to submit written arguments. No date was set for a ruling.The lawsuit is based on correspondence between Rose and Buffalo Bob Smith, the host of ''The Howdy Doody Show.''In 1970, when Smith wanted to visit college campuses and military bases with the puppet, Rose said he would lend him ''the one and only original Howdy.'' In the letter, Rose said NBC gave him the marionette with the provision that Howdy eventually be placed in the Detroit museum.However, Rose's family argued that there is no documentation between Rose and NBC to confirm such an understanding existed.Rose died in 1975

N. Clayton of the University of Chicago, who was not involved the research on the meteorite.The meteorite burned through the sky and was spotted by a group of boys in Monahans, Texas, who alerted scientists from NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston.When the NASA team, including asteroid specialist Michael Zolensky, cracked open part of the meteorite at their lab, they found purple crystals of halite -- or rock salt -- that contained minuscule pockets of water with bubbles, which indicated that water flowed on whatever parent body spawned the meteorite.Chondrite meteorites, such as the one found in Monahans, are thought to comprise some of the most primitive ingredients from the early period of the solar system, and the water in the crystals could date as far back as 4.5 billion years

84.8 9 okay NYT19980828.0051 to Daddea's secluded Acreage home, his thinking on the rock had evolved from talking about ``donating it to the Smithsonian'' to ``selling it to the highest bidder.''It's one of the reasons scientists are squeamish when talking about meteorites.``I've been burned before with meteorites,'' said Dr. Jack Horkheimer, director of the Miami Space Transit Planetarium. ``There are so many things that can mimic a meteorite. And there are people who do it for hoaxes.''Daddea says he thinks he has the real thing. That's why he took the dense, dark rock on Wednesday to the South Florida Science Museum in West Palm Beach, where planetarium director Erich Landstrom chipped off a piece of it to send to the Smithsonian for analysis.Landstrom doesn't have anything to say about the alleged meteorite until the results come back in about a month.``I get people every day telling me they've found a meteorite,'' said Eric Twelker, a lawyer in Juneau, Alaska, who owns an on-line meteorite sales business called The Meteorite Market. ``One guy's been pushing a piece of limestone on me for years.''Twelker buys and sells meteorites around the world. He has an inventory of about 500 meteorite chunks for sale and thousands of what he describes as ``little bitty things.''Meteorites are priced by the gram, and a 5-pound rock, something about the size of Daddea's find, could fetch thousands of dollars from a collector, Twelker said.Some meteorites are more significant than others. Most of them come from the asteroid belt between Jupiter and Mars. When these asteroid chunks collide during their orbits, they break apart and Jupiter's gravitational power flings them into elliptical trajectories that cross Earth's path.But others are actually wayward pieces of our moon or other planets. A meteorite from Mars, a rarity, goes for about $2,000 per gram, Twelker said. (There are about 457 grams per pound.)One piece, weighing about a hundredth of an ounce, sold at auction this year for $4,600.``Our Earth receives at least 10 tons of meteoric dust every day,'' Horkheimer said.Entry into the Earth's atmosphere burns up most of the meteorites, turning them into flashes in the night sky but nothing big enough to make an impact on the ground.But a small number of meteorite chunks do manage to survive the scorching trip through our planet's atmosphere. The biggest of all is a 60-ton meteorite that landed in Namibia.

He said he discovered it while walking to the edge of his duck pond one morning and seeing the edge of the rock sticking out in the middle of a circular, pothole-size indentation in the soft, sandy soil.``It's definitely a meteorite,'' he said.The rock does display some of the characteristics of a meteorite.It attracts a magnet _ a vast majority of meteorites contain iron.It has a dark rind on the outer surface, which appears to be what's known as a fusion crust, a burned appearance created by the entry into Earth's atmosphere. And it also has an irregular shape marked by ``thumb prints,'' which the heat generated from entry causes in meteorites.But scientists perform specialized tests on possible meteorites, examining their crystal structure and pinpointing their composition to rule out earthly copycats.``There are things that are very difficult to fake,'' Twelker said.So Daddea's waiting for the test results to come back and starting to collect preliminary offers from collectors, he said.``I've been getting offers of several thousands of dollars for it,'' he said.``What about keeping it for yourself?'' I asked.Daddea said he'd have no use for a meteorite.``It's just a rock,'' he said.Story Filed By Cox NewspapersFor Use By Clients of the New York Times News

If I had put my lifeblood into a novel and then had someone come along and try to dissect it, I guess I would be a little hesitant.''We pause here for the Cliffs Notes history.Don't worry: It's the condensed version.It all began when Cliff Hillegass, native son of Rising City, Neb., became head of the wholesale division of the Nebraska Book Co. He traveled across the country, getting to know college-bookstore owners everywhere. One day he was chatting with his buddy and business associate, bookstore owner Jack Cole, who had introduced a line of condensed classics in Canada called Cole's Notes. Why don't you try to make it fly in the United States? Cole asked Hillegass.Hillegass tapped into his network of bookstore owners and took a temperature reading: Would something like Cliffs Notes sell in the United States? Could be, they said. So, in 1958, he got busy. On a handshake deal with a Lincoln printing company, he put out 2,000 copies of Notes on each of the 16 major plays of Shakespeare, with 1,000 extra copies of the Notes on ``Macbeth.''The rest, as they say, is history.Since then, critics have decried Cliffs Notes as literary butchery. They note, for example, that Herman Melville's ``Moby Dick'' is 595 pages; the Cliffs Notes version totals 96. Cliffs Notes dispatch Chapter 1 in two paragraphs; it takes Melville that long to introduce his main character, Ishmael.Several years ago, Pennsylvania's Villanova University went so far as to ban Cliffs Notes from its bookstore.You'd think that in their birthplace, at least, Cliffs Notes would get a little respect. Think again.``No, we don't carry them, and if we did, I wouldn't tell a soul,'' says Paul, a reference librarian at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln who doesn't want to give his last name. This is a scholarly place, he says; there's no room for Notes. He punches in the computer coordinates for the Bennett Martin Public Library and finds that, yes indeed, you can find Cliffs Notes there, 254 titles, everything from Tan's ``The Joy Luck Club'' to the New Testament. (``Ooh, don't tell me how it ends!'' Paul jokes.)One sector where Cliffs Notes get plenty of respect is among students in this Midwestern college town, where Cornhusker football reigns, the airport boasts four gates and everyone has a sturdy, corn-fed, vaguely Nordic look. At the college bookstore, employee Joyce Jensen has seen plenty of panic in the last 15 years.``(Students) come running in here all desperate,'' Jensen says. ``They get all disappointed when they find we've sold out of a certain (Cliffs Notes). And they think there's a Cliffs Notes for every single book ever published. There's not.''(Tubach assures such students that almost any title can be downloaded for $6 off the Internet at www.cliffs.com.

(Guthrie died in 1967 of Huntington's chorea, a degenerative disorder of the nervous system.) It was there that Bragg met Guthrie's daughter, Nora Guthrie, who was establishing an archive of her father's music.
99.7 10 okay NYT19980731.0097 punk to protest music, he began to appreciate the legacy of such songs as ``This Land Is Your Land,'' ``Bound for Glory'' and ``Pastures of Plenty.'' Bragg realized he had a lot in common with Guthrie, though the two musicians were separated by a couple generations and an ocean.``Me and Woody had pretty different experiences _ he in the 1930s and '40s and me in the '70s and '80s _ but I think we came to similar conclusions,'' Bragg said.In 1992, Bragg was invited to perform at a memorial concert celebrating what would have been Guthrie's 80th birthday at New York's Central Park. (Guthrie died in 1967 of Huntington's chorea, a degenerative disorder of the nervous system.) It was there that Bragg met Guthrie's daughter, Nora Guthrie, who was establishing an archive of her father's music.Sensing a similarity between Bragg's music and her father's, Nora Guthrie gave Bragg photocopies of several of Woody Guthrie's songs.``Some of them were typed and some were handwritten,'' Bragg said. ``(Guthrie) took a correspondence course in typing as a teenager and he was a very fast typist. The lyrics for `Bound for Glory' were typed without punctuation.''With Nora Guthrie's encouragement, Bragg's interpretations of Guthrie's songs led to the creation of Bragg's new album, ``Mermaid Avenue,'' named for the Coney Island street where Guthrie and his family lived the late 1940s and early '50s. The extraordinary album features 15 previously unrecorded Guthrie songs, among them ``Way Over Yonder in the Minor Key,'' ``Hoodoo Voodoo'' and ``Christ for President,'' brought to life by Bragg and roots-rock band Wilco, with guest vocals on two songs by Natalie Merchant.``They're all complete songs,'' Bragg said of the Guthrie tunes on the album. ``But the music was not written down, it was carried in his head. There is no musical notation whatsoever.''Even so, Bragg and Wilco had little difficulty imagining what Guthrie may have had in mind when he wrote the songs.``As a songwriter, I sweat over my lyrics more than anything. So much of the effort goes into writing the lyrics and making them articulate something,'' Bragg said. ``But the music just flows. I hear the music as I write the words. So all I had to do with Woody's lyrics was sit down and feel the tunes. And if the music didn't fit, I'd try another song.''Occasionally, Guthrie, as if speaking from the afterlife, gave Bragg little clues.Bragg was startled to discover a song Guthrie had written in the early '50s titled ``My Flying Saucer.'' To Bragg, the song was evidence Guthrie was ahead of his time, forging sounds that would later reach the mainstream.``I would not expect Woody Guthrie to write a song that might end up on `The X-Files,' '' Bragg said.Even more surprising, Guthrie had written the words ``supersonic boogie'' in the upper left hand corner of the page, where he often indicated a song's tempo.Fascinated by the uncharacteristic phrase, Bragg was inspired to try something different.``I heard the little guy's voice whispering in my ear, and he said, `Go on, Bill, I dare you. I dare you to take one of the sacred texts of St. Woody Guthrie and play it to a supersonic boogie.'``I thought, All right, Woody boy, I'll take you up on it. You wrote these two little words, almost 50 years ago, for me to pick up on. And I'm going to run with it.''Bragg said he was encouraged by the response the album has received from those who were close to Guthrie, including folk musician Fred Hellerman.``These are people who are very, very concerned, but also very, very old,'' Bragg said. ``And they want to know that this legacy is going to be passed on.''Bragg said he is often asked if Guthrie is relevant today.``Ask Beck that question,'' he said. ``Who else is more cutting edge than Beck? And there he is quoting Woody Guthrie, copping licks off Woody, talking about Woody in interviews.''Bragg is still chuckling over a recent magazine article in which Beck said Guthrie was sexy but folk veteran Pete Seeger, whose friendship with Guthrie began in the '30s, was not.The subject came up later at the Woody Guthrie archive, located at the New York office of talent manager Harold Leventhal, who also represents Seeger. Leventhal's wife, Natalie, offered a recollection of Guthrie's sex appeal.``She and I were standing by the copy machine and she said, `You didn't know Woody, did you?' And I said, `No, Natalie, no I didn't.'``At that point, she sort of looked off into the distance and said, `Well, you know, Woody was a scrawny little guy with a big nose and sort of black fuzzy hair . . . But, by God, he was sexy.'``That kind of stuff is just priceless. You can't get that from an archive.'

He wants to avoid that same fate himself; Bragg, too, writes songs with direct political messages as well as songs on more personal topics.After being invited by Guthrie's heirs to dig through an archive of 2,500 Guthrie lyrics whose melodies were never recorded, and to write new tunes for them, Bragg has become more of a Guthrie fan than ever.His new album, ``Mermaid Avenue'' (Elektra), is a collaboration with the country-rock band Wilco, which backs him up and plays its own Guthrie finds.At the Bottom Line on Thursday night, amid a droll line of between-song patter, Bragg praised Guthrie as a both a punk forebear and a lyricist who ``mixes the personal with the political.'' He chose Guthrie lyrics that can be whimsical and rude, affectionate and pensive, connecting them back to Elizabethan ballads and forward to Guthrie's rock heirs.Bragg began his set alone with his electric guitar, then was joined by Ian McLagan on keyboards.

His hometown of Okemah, Okla., just hosted a weeklong celebration of their native son to mark his birthday on July 14, 1912.``Some day people are going to wake up to the fact that Woody Guthrie and the ten thousand songs that leap and tumble off the strings of his music box are a national possession like Yellowstone and Yosemite, and part of the best stuff this country has to show the world,'' opined The New Yorker's review of Woody's autobiography, ``Bound for Glory.''That was in 1943.In 1998, ask the pink-haired, multiple-earringed clerk at Borders where one might find said autobiography, and she'll answer, ``Woody Guthrie ... he was a musician, right?''Yes, he was a musician.And yet even the folks who know that much don't always know what Woody was about. He roamed and rambled the country in the 1930s, but he wasn't some dreamy-eyed folk singer, gently strumming a guitar as he rode the rails.No, Woody's guitar had the words ``This machine kills fascists'' painted on it.His most famous song _ ``This Land Is Your Land'' _ is not the patriotic ditty it appears. You may know the first couple of verses, but

Woody wrote down the words _ but not the tunes _ while living on Mermaid Avenue on Coney Island after World War II. Woody's daughter Nora Guthrie, curator of the Woody Guthrie Archive in New York, approached Bragg about setting the songs to music. The album has been hailed by critics as one of the year's best.Woody is on one of four folk-singer stamps issued on June 26, along with Huddie ``Leadbelly'' Ledbetter, Josh White and Sonny Terry.In December, the Smithsonian will launch a traveling exhibit on Woody's life and legacy, including home movies, diaries, drawings, lyrics, photographs and recordings, including the landmark interviews Woody taped in 1940 with folklorist Alan Lomax for the Library of Congress.The essential Woody:Beginning in 1944, Woody recorded more than 150 original and traditional songs for Folkways Records.

Gov. Thomas P. O'Neill III.''We have reviewed these consulting contracts and have determined that they are not necessary and

102.7 5 okay NYT20000411.0351 The Massachusetts governor, Paul Cellucci, announced Tuesday that after reviewing a 48-page audit report by the Federal Highway Administration criticizing the dig's management, he had asked Kerasiotes to resign and would replace him with Andrew S.

102.7 6 okay APW20000215.0170 The chairman of a House subcommittee demanded an investigation Tuesday into whether officials overseeing Boston's massive ``Big Dig'' highway project withheld information about cost overruns to ensure federal funding would continue.Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., head of the House Appropriations transportation panel, also wants an independent audit of Big Dig finances and suggested subpoenas may be necessary to ensure everything comes out.Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater said it was unacceptable that project officials were not more forthcoming about costs but told Wolf's panel he must complete a review of a report released Monday by the inspector general before deciding whether to take action.In his report, Kenneth Mead documented cost construction overruns of at least $942 million and chastised state and federal transportation officials for ``an alarming lapse in oversight.''The three-mile Big Dig project, officially called the Central Artery-Third Harbor Tunnel, goes through downtown Boston. It was started in 1993 and was supposed to be finished next year, but delays have pushed back the completion date to perhaps as late as 2006.Three months ago, the Federal Highway Administration and Big Dig officials objected to a draft version of the inspector general's report, claiming the cost estimates were exaggerated.But last week, Big Dig officials revealed the project would cost more than $13.2 billion, about $1.4 billion more than previously estimated. That admission came only hours after the FHA, charged with overseeing the project, had signed off on the Big Dig's yearly finance plan. It did not mention the overruns.Wolf, a longtime critic of the project, said protestations about the draft report look like ``deliberate deceit.'' He asked whether there might be a ``civil or criminal penalty for not telling the truth'' in this situation.He said neither Big Dig officials nor the FHA could be trusted to provide information about costs and that an independent agency with subpoena power should conduct an audit.Big Dig spokesman Jeremy Crockford denied wrongdoing.``We have been working very closely with Federal Highway since the beginning. We reject any notion that we left them in the dark about the project,'' he said

Amway recently completed buybacks of shares of Amway Asia Pacific Ltd. and Amway Japan, Ltd., its only publicly held subsidiaries."Our cash position is solid, our debt is manageable, we're financially very strong," Bain said. "Our sales are a bit behind what we hoped they would be, but that's not the driving force here."Bain said tentative plans call for Amway to reorganize into three divisions:- A direct-selling unit that concentrates on Amway's traditional business, while overseeing Quixtar, Amway's Internet-retailing sister company launched last fall;- A manufacturing and business unit;- An entrepreneurial division to come up with new ways to direct-market to the public, possibly incorporating some of the Internet technologies used by Quixtar.Al Koop, who heads Amway's operations, will take over the distribution and manufacturing unit.Steve Van Andel and Dick DeVos will retain their jobs as chairman and president respectively.Amway's free-lance work force, also known as independent business owners, should not be affected, Bain said

111.6 5 vital NYT19980828.0198 After decades of peddling soap, detergent and toothpaste to Middle America, Amway Corp., the direct-marketing juggernaut, wants to clean up in another line of business: mutual funds.Merrill Lynch and Fidelity Investments shouldn't be too concerned. Amway's army of more than 1 million distributors won't be hawking fund shares at neighborhood coffee klatches or at the office water cooler. Nor will they seek to sign up their friends and neighbors to sell the fund in the type of multilevel marketing plan for which the company is famous.For now, at least, Amway distributors are the target buyers, not sellers, of shares of the Amway Mutual fund. ``This is not soap, where we market to our distributors and they sell to customers and receive bonuses based on sales,'' said James Rosloniec, an Amway vice president who oversees the company's mutual fund efforts. ``But we would like to make the fund more noticeable.''In short, Amway wants its $162 million stock fund to grow and possibly multiply into a family of mutual funds. That, in turn, could let Amway funds expand into corporate retirement plans and, thus, reach more investors outside the Amway family circle.Amway, whose $7 billion in worldwide sales makes it one of the country's largest privately held companies, is not a newcomer to the mutual fund game.

The world-famous Longwood, in the Brandywine area, 30 miles west of Philadelphia near Kennett Square, Pa., is the extraordinary creation of industrialist Pierre Samuel du Pont (1870-1954). A Quaker farming family first owned the land, which du Pont purchased in 1906 to save the trees on the land; the name, Longwood, is taken from the Quaker meetinghouse built in 1859 and located a few miles to the south.This 1,050-acre horticultural showplace attracts more than 800,000 visitors a year, which means visitors should prepare for overcrowding on holidays and special weekends. Longwood has one of the world's largest conservatories, 20 outdoor and 20 indoor gardens within four acres of greenhouses, a topiary garden, and 11,000 types of plants. One of the most eye-catching displays is the Lily Display Garden, an outdoor aquatic display featuring tropical and hardy water lilies on giant platters, in bloom from July to October.Special events and themes occur year round. This year's Easter display runs March 27-April 9 when lilies, daffodils, freesias, and tulips fill the indoor gardens. From April 10 through May 28, ``Acres of Spring'' features tens of thousands of daffodils, along with blossoming magnolias, forsythias, and flowering cherries. The summer's ``Festival of Fountains'' highlights annual and perennial flowers, as well as alfresco concerts and water displays in three fountain gardens. During the year, there are about 400 performing arts events, from concerts on the Longwood's world-famous 10,010-pipe organ to fully staged outdoor musical productions.Another du Pont site is the Hagley Museum and Library, in the Delaware section of the Brandywine River Valley. Although understandably overshadowed by its more prominent neighbors, this 240-acre site is home to a phenomenal ruin garden, which features exquisitely beautiful broken mosaics and crumbled columns. The Hagley also maintains a formal French vegetable garden.French gardens also are the highlight at Nemours, a re-creation of French chateau country north of Wilmington. The 300-acre estate was the residence of Alfred I. du Pont, and is a legacy of the French architectural and gardening traditions that were part of his heritage. The grounds include animal sculptures, fountains, and sunken gardens. Colonnades, gates, and figurines add to the architectural splendor.Northwest of Wilmington is the Winterthur Museum, Garden & Library, a 60-acre garden on the 1,000-acre estate that has been in du Pont ownership since 1811 and was the former country estate of Henry Francis. Unlike Longwood or Nemours, Winterthur draws its inspiration directly from nature. For example, the gorgeous eight-acre azalea woods, in the main part of the garden, were created from the gaping holes left in the canopies after a chestnut blight struck the area in 1911. Winterthur is more known as a world-class museum of American decorative arts, and visitors discover that the outside art of the year-round gardens complement the treasures found indoors.Closer to Philadelphia, in Merion, just west of the city, is the Arboretum of the Barnes Foundation, which houses the 1,000-piece world-famous art collection of Dr. Albert C. Barnes (1982-1951). Plants were selected for their color, texture, seasonal change, and floral display. Barnes handled the paintings, while his wife, Laura, tended to the garden, making it a living art gallery, with plants and flowers selected for visual and aesthetic values. A collection of nearly 200 lilacs was originally selected for its color, graduating from lighter to deeper shades of purple. There now are more than 250 lilac varieties, a rose and peony garden, crabapples, and a woodland on the arboretum's 12 acres.America's oldest surviving botanical garden, Historic Bartram's Garden, is tucked away in a 44-acre tract of land in West Philadelphia along the Schuylkill River. As a garden, it grew the notable plants of the continent; it was also the meeting place for Colonial politicians and scientists, and is credited with saving the Franklinia alatamaha tree from extinction. On May 18 through 23, Bartram's will be celebrating its 300th anniversary with special events, including a living history festival.Another Colonial garden landmark in the city is Wyck, home to nine generations of the same Quaker Philadelphia family, the Wistars and Haineses, from 1690-1973.The country's first horticultural society, the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society, founded in 1827 and located next to the headquarters of Independence Park

The world-famous Longwood, in the Brandywine area, 30 miles west of Philadelphia near Kennett Square, Pa., is the extraordinary creation of industrialist Pierre Samuel du Pont (1870-1954). A Quaker farming family first owned the land, which du Pont purchased in 1906 to save the trees on the land; the name, Longwood, is taken from the Quaker meetinghouse built in 1859 and located a few miles to the south.This 1,050-acre horticultural showplace attracts more than 800,000 visitors a year, which means visitors should prepare for overcrowding on holidays and special weekends. Longwood has one of the world's largest conservatories, 20 outdoor and 20 indoor gardens within four acres of greenhouses, a topiary garden, and 11,000 types of plants. One of the most eye-catching displays is the Lily Display Garden, an outdoor aquatic display featuring tropical and hardy water lilies on giant platters, in bloom from July to October.Special events and themes occur year round. This year's Easter display runs March 27-April 9 when lilies, daffodils, freesias, and tulips fill the indoor gardens. From April 10 through May 28, ``Acres of Spring'' features tens of thousands of daffodils, along with blossoming magnolias, forsythias, and flowering cherries. The summer's ``Festival of Fountains'' highlights annual and perennial flowers, as well as alfresco concerts and water displays in three fountain gardens. During the year, there are about 400 performing arts events, from concerts on the Longwood's world-famous 10,010-pipe organ to fully staged outdoor musical productions.Another du Pont site is the Hagley Museum and Library, in the Delaware section of the Brandywine River Valley. Although understandably overshadowed by its more prominent neighbors, this 240-acre site is home to a phenomenal ruin garden, which features exquisitely beautiful broken mosaics and crumbled columns. The Hagley also maintains a formal French vegetable garden.French gardens also are the highlight at Nemours, a re-creation of French chateau country north of Wilmington. The 300-acre estate was the residence of Alfred I. du Pont, and is a legacy of the French architectural and gardening traditions that were part of his heritage. The grounds include animal sculptures, fountains, and sunken gardens. Colonnades, gates, and figurines add to the architectural splendor.Northwest of Wilmington is the Winterthur Museum, Garden & Library, a 60-acre garden on the 1,000-acre estate that has been in du Pont ownership since 1811 and was the former country estate of Henry Francis. Unlike Longwood or Nemours, Winterthur draws its inspiration directly from nature. For example, the gorgeous eight-acre azalea woods, in the main part of the garden, were created from the gaping holes left in the canopies after a chestnut blight struck the area in 1911. Winterthur is more known as a world-class museum of American decorative arts, and visitors discover that the outside art of the year-round gardens complement the treasures found indoors.Closer to Philadelphia, in Merion, just west of the city, is the Arboretum of the Barnes Foundation, which houses the 1,000-piece world-famous art collection of Dr. Albert C. Barnes (1982-1951). Plants were selected for their color, texture, seasonal change, and floral display. Barnes handled the paintings, while his wife, Laura, tended to the garden, making it a living art gallery, with plants and flowers selected for visual and aesthetic values. A collection of nearly 200 lilacs was originally selected for its color, graduating from lighter to deeper shades of purple. There now are more than 250 lilac varieties, a rose and peony garden, crabapples, and a woodland on the arboretum's 12 acres.America's oldest surviving botanical garden, Historic Bartram's Garden, is tucked away in a 44-acre tract of land in West Philadelphia along the Schuylkill River. As a garden, it grew the notable plants of the continent; it was also the meeting place for Colonial politicians and scientists, and is credited with saving the Franklinia alatamaha tree from extinction. On May 18 through 23, Bartram's will be celebrating its 300th anniversary with special events, including a living history festival.Another Colonial garden landmark in the city is Wyck, home to nine generations of the same Quaker Philadelphia family, the Wistars and Haineses, from 1690-1973.The country's first horticultural society, the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society, founded in 1827 and located next to the headquarters of Independence Park

Longwood has one of the world's largest conservatories, 20 outdoor and 20 indoor gardens within four acres of greenhouses, a topiary garden, and 11,000 types of plants. One of the most eye-catching displays is the Lily Display Garden, an outdoor aquatic display featuring tropical and hardy water lilies on giant platters, in bloom from July to October.Special events and themes occur year round. This year's Easter display runs March 27-April 9 when lilies, daffodils, freesias, and tulips fill the indoor gardens. From April 10 through May 28, ``Acres of Spring'' features tens of thousands of daffodils, along with blossoming magnolias, forsythias, and flowering cherries. The summer's ``Festival of Fountains'' highlights annual and perennial flowers, as well as alfresco concerts and water displays in three fountain gardens. During the year, there are about 400 performing arts events, from concerts on the Longwood's world-famous 10,010-pipe organ to fully staged outdoor musical productions.Another du Pont site is the Hagley Museum and Library, in the Delaware section of the Brandywine River Valley. Although understandably overshadowed by its more prominent neighbors, this 240-acre site is home to a phenomenal ruin garden, which features exquisitely beautiful broken mosaics and crumbled columns. The Hagley also maintains a formal French vegetable garden.French gardens also are the highlight at Nemours, a re-creation of French chateau country north of Wilmington. The 300-acre estate was the residence of Alfred I. du Pont, and is a legacy of the French architectural and gardening traditions that were part of his heritage. The grounds include animal sculptures, fountains, and sunken gardens. Colonnades, gates, and figurines add to the architectural splendor.Northwest of Wilmington is the Winterthur Museum, Garden & Library, a 60-acre garden on the 1,000-acre estate that has been in du Pont ownership since 1811 and was the former country estate of Henry Francis. Unlike Longwood or Nemours, Winterthur draws its inspiration directly from nature. For example, the gorgeous eight-acre azalea woods, in the main part of the garden, were created from the gaping holes left in the canopies after a chestnut blight struck the area in 1911. Winterthur is more known as a world-class museum of American decorative arts, and visitors discover that the outside art of the year-round gardens complement the treasures found indoors.Closer to Philadelphia, in Merion, just west of the city, is the Arboretum of the Barnes Foundation, which houses the 1,000-piece world-famous art collection of Dr. Albert C. Barnes (1982-1951). Plants were selected for their color, texture, seasonal change, and floral display. Barnes handled the paintings, while his wife, Laura, tended to the garden, making it a living art gallery, with plants and flowers selected for visual and aesthetic values. A collection of nearly 200 lilacs was originally selected for its color, graduating from lighter to deeper shades of purple. There now are more than 250 lilac varieties, a rose and peony garden, crabapples, and a woodland on the arboretum's 12 acres.America's oldest surviving botanical garden, Historic Bartram's Garden, is tucked away in a 44-acre tract of land in West Philadelphia along the Schuylkill River. As a garden, it grew the notable plants of the continent; it was also the meeting place for Colonial politicians and scientists, and is credited with saving the Franklinia alatamaha tree from extinction. On May 18 through 23, Bartram's will be celebrating its 300th anniversary with special events, including a living history festival.Another Colonial garden landmark in the city is Wyck, home to nine generations of the same Quaker Philadelphia family, the Wistars and Haineses, from 1690-1973.The country's first horticultural society, the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society, founded in 1827 and located next to the headquarters of Independence Park

The roots, which hibernate until spring, can make a potent starch. She knows not to waste any parts.``I would like to challenge the people of the Southeast to take all the kudzu vines that go up the trees, pull them out and put them to work,'' she says. ``When Americans find out what they can do with kudzu, they will realize how valuable it is.''Kudzu valuable?Over the past century, the creeping vines have earned the appellation ``Green Menace.'' Kudzu originally was spread to curb soil erosion on Southern farms. Too late, farmers found it was virtually unstoppable. The U.S. Forest Service estimates kudzu covers 7 million acres of the South, smothering everything in its path with green leaves and purple blossoms.Southerners and scientists alike call the plant an annoying weed, ``the vine that ate the South.'' Edith, the queen of kudzu, is more philosophical: ``Lots of things are a nuisance. You just have to take control of it.''The 73-year-old farmer's wife has plumbed kudzu's potential for 30 years, and her business, Kudzu Konnection, is attracting attention all across the South.Edith and her husband, Henry, turn their 10 acres of kudzu into wreaths, baskets, potato chip-like snacks, quiche, tea, syrup, paper, furniture, medicines. They also feed it to the horses and cattle on their 400-acre farm.``It's a hobby grown into a business,'' she says, proudly fingering a glass jar of freshly made kudzu jelly. ``We won't get rich, but we'll educate people, and it's fun.''Kudzu Konnection has been around about 15 years. Edwards incorporated the company the same year a Charlotte broadcaster dubbed her the ``Kudzu Queen,'' a nickname that has extended to her family.Her daughter, Caroline Edwards, 40, has been christened the ``Kudzu Kid'' after inheriting her mom's passion.``It can be used for anything.

117.7 11 okay NYT20000202.0162 Kudzu may finally meet its match.Federal plant scientists say they have identified a common fungus that kills the bothersome vine within hours.The fungus, known as Myrothecium verrucaria, also kills cotton, soybeans and a fairly wide variety of other plants, but plant pathologist C. Douglas Boyette said it can be applied to kudzu in lethal doses without endangering other plants.``I don't know about winning the war with kudzu, but we're going to do battle with it,'' Boyette said in a telephone interview from his U.S. Agricultural Research Service laboratory in Stoneville, Miss.In greenhouse and field studies, the scientists found that the fungus killed 100 percent of kudzu weeds. The fungus destroys leaves and stems and also appears to invade the potato-like roots, which serve as reservoirs of starch from which new kudzu vines grow after stems and leaves are mowed or killed with herbicides.Kudzu, native to eastern Asia, was introduced into the eastern and southern United States in the 1800s. It was originally promoted for erosion control and as an inexpensive forage for livestock. It has crept over an estimated 7 million acres, from Florida to New York to Texas, with heavy infestations in Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi.M. verrucaria grows practically everywhere, Boyette said, even on kudzu vines. However, in its natural state it exists in small colonies.The trick to killing kudzu with it was to produce trillions of microscopic fungus spores and mix them in a liquid solution that could be sprayed onto the vines. The solution contains over 20 million spores in a volume of spray equal to that of a sugar cube.``We get upwards of 100 percent control,'' Boyette said. ``Within 24 to 48 hours, the plant is dead.''To determine whether the fungus spray spreads to non-target species, Boyette sprayed kudzu with the solution in tests adjacent to soybean fields and found no damage to the beans. When washed off the kudzu leaves, as might happen if a heavy rain followed an application, the solution was diluted to the point of being harmless, he said.Even so, environmental and toxicological studies currently under way must be finished before the fungus mix is generally available to kudzu foes, he said.That may take as long as two years, Boyette said.

Sheep, he says, are heat tolerant, and could be the answer to the South's kudzu quandary.Diane Hoots, the self-described ``Kudzu Queen'' of Georgia, would like to extend that strategy, and get humans to consume their fair share of the weed. ``If you can't beat it, eat it,'' she says.Hoots, 47, is author of several books about kudzu, and maker of kudzu jelly, and kudzu-vine baskets carried in such stores as Ed & Phoebe's on the square in Marietta. ``We sell cases and cases of the jelly,'' says co-owner Ivonne McDonald, adding that it has a flavor similar to apple jelly, with a subtle aftertaste.Hoots' kudzu syrup is also used as the glaze on the kudzu kebab served at the Kudzu Grill in Chattanooga. ``It's probably one of our best-selling items,'' says kitchen manager Ted Flint of the pork loin dish.Jelly, baskets and more will be on display at the Providence Canyon State Park's Kudzu Takeover Day, Aug. 7. Providence Canyon, an hour south of Columbus, is itself an emblem of the forces that brought kudzu to the South. Once home to cotton farmers, the land eroded to a depth of 150 feet from poor soil management. As the ``canyons'' widened, structures plunged into the cracks, including the 19th century Providence United Methodist Church building that gave the region its name. Despite the planting of kudzu there, erosion continues.Which goes to show that kudzu can't solve every soil problem. Flora Tolar's father must have sensed this back in the 1930s, because every time the Civilian Conservation boys came by to plant kudzu near his Mississippi farm, he'd dig it up again.Even so, the plant took hold. ``We have hundreds of acres around us,'' says Tolar, 66, who is Hoots' Mississippi counterpart. ``If I didn't

The 53-year-old Hayes could not be reached for comment.``It's unusual but it's not unheard of,'' Mrozek said Tuesday, pointing out that the office has in the past decade charged at least one other man with the unauthorized wearing of a medal.The Medal of Honor is the highest distinction that can be awarded to members of the military in battle. The bronze five-pointed star was first awarded by Abraham Lincoln in the Civil War.Others have been convicted of both illegally wearing fake medals and selling real ones on the black market, where they can fetch up to $25,000.While the charge is rare _ the Department of Justice doesn't keep records of how many medal-related crimes are committed _ the government takes the offense seriously. In 1994, Congress voted to increase the penalty for wearing a fake Medal of Honor, which used to carry a maximum $250 fine and six-month jail sentence.Hayes was questioned by police Nov. 6, when he was scheduled as a featured speaker at the Wal-Mart event in Lompoc, an agricultural town in northern Santa Barbara County.Mrozek said the event was advertised, which drew attention to Hayes. FBI and local police investigated after a tipster checked an Internet record of Medal of Honor winners and did not find Hayes' name.A magistrate judge set a Feb. 22 trial date.Sam Kalfayan, who acted as an interpreter for Gen. George Patton in World War II, is one of 24 veterans who helps run the Legion of Valor in Fresno, Calif. _ the largest museum dedicated to Medal of Honor and Navy Cross winners in the nation.Kalfayan, 87, pointed out that ``living Medal of Honor winners are very few,'' because 70 percent to 80 percent of the recipients perform heroics that end with their deaths.``Pretending you were awarded a medal when you didn't is a disgrace to the people who died for them,'' Kalfayan said. ``I can't think of a bigger embarrassment.'

Like Carson, he said, he spent time in his youth wandering his family's farm in Carthage, Tenn., ``looking for critters'' and learning to love nature.He recalled how, when he was a teenager, his mother bought a copy of ``Silent Spring'' and then spent the next few weeks over the breakfast table discussing with Gore and his sister, Nancy, the book's warning against pesticides and other chemicals.Where Carson had started studying the environment as a teen-ager, publishing her first article at age 14, Gore recalled studying at Harvard University under professor Roger Revelle, a pioneer in researching the atmospheric effects of carbon dioxide.``A long time ago,'' Gore told several hundred people gathered on the lawn of a high school here, ``I joined with the spirit of Rachel Carson in committing myself to a new springtime filled with the sounds of wild birds, with the sounds of children learning about and appreciating the environment.''Carson's work has been criticized by chemical manufacturers and some prominent scientists. She has been accused of overstating the case against pesticides, of abandoning objectivity for bitter polemics. But her main findings about the dangers of pesticides to the environment continue to have broad acceptance, and

The artist is poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. The art is Longfellow's famous poem, ``Paul Revere's Ride,'' written 85 years after the event.The discrepancies between Revere's real ride and his ride in the poem are many, and they not only offer us insights into how artists show history, but also force us to question how seriously (if at all) we should trust artists to tell the truth.The real Paul Revere, by the way, understood very well that artists fudge the truth, especially since he did so himself in a noted work of pre-Revolution propaganda: a popular, inflammatory and grossly inaccurate engraving of the Boston Massacre (1770), which made for a far more interesting story than what actually happened.An ardent voice for American independence _ one of the original Sons of Liberty and an organizer of the Boston Tea Party _ Revere took many midnight rides before his most famous one, organizing a network of fellow patriots ready to warn the countryside if and when the Redcoats decided to move.The network worked as designed: On the night of April 18, when he rode off to Lexington, the roads out of Boston (contrary to the poem) were full not only of Longfellow's ``flowing moonlight'' and British Regulars, but of Paul Revere's mounted friends.After his ride, Revere was a local hero. But the Revolution had produced lots of local heroes. Revere was just one brave patriot among many, until Longfellow came along.In his own realm, Longfellow too was a hero. One of the first American poets to write about American subjects, he was also the first to introduce American readers to modern European languages and poetry (``Hiawatha,'' for instance, employed a Finnish folk-meter completely alien to New World readers).Like Revere, Longfellow was a patriot. And in 1860, with civil war looking inevitable, he decided, through poetry, to remind his countrymen of their shared heritage. The result was ``Paul Revere's Ride.''But Longfellow was more than a patriot; he was a poet, too, and he knew the demands of poetry aren't the same as the demands of history. To emphasize the point of Revere's ride (``the fate of a nation was riding that night''), Longfellow took many liberties with the real story, altering the facts in order to dramatize them.For example, the famous lantern signal (``One if by land, and two if by sea/ And I on the opposite shore will be'') was not flashed to Revere but to his compatriots in Charlestown; Revere was still in Boston when the signal was sent.It's much more dramatic, however, to have Revere himself, not some nameless men from across the river, eagerly watching the belfry. And it's much more exciting to have Revere ride not just to Lexington but Concord too, although in reality he never made it to Concord (he was stopped by a British patrol).But the biggest change Longfellow made _ and the change which makes the poem so good _ was his dramatic portrayal of Revere as the brave lone rider who saves his country, when in reality, his role in saving the country was as a part of a highly organized group. In short, Revere was brave indeed, but he was hardly ever alone that night.``Paul Revere's Ride'' was an instant hit (except with historians). It made its local hero a national treasure, and it presented a whole new look to the American Revolution, a look which, however inaccurate, has remained a lively part of our view of the past for more than 100 years.On the recent anniversary of Paul Revere's real ride, what lesson can Paul Revere's imaginary ride teach us?Just this: Art accompanied by a ``based on a true story'' tag line should be regarded with a great deal of skepticism.

To emphasize the point of Revere's ride (``the fate of a nation was riding that night''), Longfellow took many liberties with the real story, altering the facts in order to dramatize them.For example, the famous lantern signal (``One if by land, and two if by sea/ And I on the opposite shore will be'') was not flashed to Revere but to his compatriots in Charlestown; Revere was still in Boston when the signal was sent.It's much more dramatic, however, to have Revere himself, not some nameless men from across the river, eagerly watching the belfry.

In short, Revere was brave indeed, but he was hardly ever alone that night.``Paul Revere's Ride'' was an instant hit (except with historians).

122.8 6 okay NYT20000418.0114 anniversary of a historical moment remembered primarily because of its rendering as ``true story'' art. The moment is a night in 1775 before the American Revolution. The artist is poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. The art is Longfellow's famous poem, ``Paul Revere's Ride,'' written 85 years after the event.The discrepancies between Revere's real ride and his ride in the poem are many, and they not only offer us insights into how artists show history, but also force us to question how seriously (if at all) we should trust artists to tell the truth.The real Paul Revere, by the way, understood very well that artists fudge the truth, especially since he did so himself in a noted work of pre-Revolution propaganda: a popular, inflammatory and grossly inaccurate engraving of the Boston Massacre (1770), which made for a far more interesting story than what actually happened.An ardent voice for American independence _ one of the original Sons of Liberty and an organizer of the Boston Tea Party _ Revere took many midnight rides before his most famous one, organizing a network of fellow patriots ready to warn the countryside if and when the Redcoats decided to move.The network worked as designed: On the night of April 18, when he rode off to Lexington, the roads out of Boston (contrary to the poem) were full not only of Longfellow's ``flowing moonlight'' and British Regulars, but of Paul Revere's mounted friends.After his ride, Revere was a local hero. But the Revolution had produced lots of local heroes. Revere was just one brave patriot among many, until Longfellow came along.In his own realm, Longfellow too was a hero. One of the first American poets to write about American subjects, he was also the first to introduce American readers to modern European languages and poetry (``Hiawatha,'' for instance, employed a Finnish folk-meter completely alien to New World readers).Like Revere, Longfellow was a patriot. And in 1860, with civil war looking inevitable, he decided, through poetry, to remind his countrymen of their shared heritage. The result was ``Paul Revere's Ride.''But Longfellow was more than a patriot; he was a poet, too, and he knew the demands of poetry aren't the same as the demands of history.

Today, those words of Stein, who was killed in the gas chambers of Auschwitz, make Catholics as uncomfortable as they make Jews angry. Church officials avoid mentioning them as they prepare for Saturday's canonization of Stein _ a woman who embodied the conflicts and contradictions facing John Paul's papacy as it tries to come to terms with the Holocaust, and with Jews. A German-born convert, Stein appealed to Pope Pius XII in 1933 to speak out against the Nazis.

128.6 10 okay APW19980616.1609 And OPEC's members have long lacked the willpower to stick to their production agreements. OPEC got itself into this jam by agreeing last winter to increase production, just before the economic crisis in Asia severely weakened global oil demand. Although OPEC's stated production ceiling is 27.5 million barrels a day, too high for current demand, outside experts say output hovers above 28 million barrels. Analysts aren't predicting a repeat of the 1986 carnage, but they say the industry is changing dramatically. As Big Oil adapted over the past decade to an era of cheaper prices, cutting production costs and many thousands of jobs, OPEC members have become ever more dependent on high oil revenues, according to Peter Bogin, an analyst at Cambridge Energy Research Associates in Paris. The huge oversupply, which could persist for months or years, might force OPEC members to find ways to become less dependent on a market they no longer can control, he said. ``They have to say, `What's our role as a cartel, if we are a cartel, or can we accept dlrs 6 or dlrs 8 oil?''

A powerful earthquake 100 miles off the coast of Chile in 1960 caused a tsunami that inundated the Japanese coastline, killing 119.Until now, the only way to predict these waves has been to monitor distant earthquakes and guess the likely speed, size and direction of any tsunami they might produce.

130.7 9 okay APW19980617.1399 of 30 mph (48 kph) to 50 mph (80 kph) is more than humans can do on foot.That's why the federal government and the states of California, Oregon, Washington, Alaska and Hawaii want to improve the technology used to detect tsunamis and increase civil-disaster planning and public education.``We know that we're due for a big one,'' said George Crawford, earthquake program coordinator for Washington state's emergency management division.The threat is not new.Most of the 132 people killed in a 1964 Alaska earthquake were victims of tsunamis. About 20 of the estimated 121 tsunami victims were outside Alaska as the waves ravaged other parts of the West Coast.In Hawaii, tsunamis are the deadliest natural threat, blamed for more than 300 deaths since the 1940s.Over the past century, there has been an average of one damaging tsunami per year in the Pacific basin, with a 100-year toll of about 70,000 people. In just three years, from 1992-1994, a half dozen tsunamis over 15 feet (4.6-meter) tall killed more than 2,300 people.But the threat has taken on new urgency with evidence in the past 15 years that a coastal earthquake zone from Northern California to British Columbia _ the Cascadia subduction zone, where plates of the Earth's crust are colliding _ is capable of generating giant quakes that could send tsunamis crashing ashore in a matter of minutes.It really hit home in April 1992, when a 7.2-magnitude quake struck off the coast of California's Humboldt County.``It created a massive amount of damage in Northern California ... and it produced a small tsunami'' about 1-3 feet (10 centimeters) high, said Eddie Bernard, director of the Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory here and chairman of the National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program.``Now, this was the first time that California had had a subduction-zone earthquake and an accompanying tsunami,'' Bernard said. ``That woke up everybody.''Before that, officials had believed there would be hours of lead time for a tsunami threat.``Humboldt really turned all of that on its head,'' said Richard Eisner, regional administrator for the coastal region of California's emergency-services agency.The U.S. Senate asked the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to assess the threat and state preparedness. But as Bernard began organizing meetings, he found that the federal officials responsible for issuing tsunami warnings, and the local officials responsible for dealing with the results, didn't know much about each other.A steering group of representatives from federal agencies and the five states came up with a three-pronged approach:Hazard assessment. A center was set up last year in Newport, Ore., to help produce ``tsunami inundation maps,'' showing coastal areas that would be flooded by tsunamis. Local officials can use the maps to plot evacuation routes or decide locations for critical facilities such as fire stations and hospitals.Warning guidance. The region's network of seismic stations is being expanded and upgraded to better track the source and type of earthquakes for NOAA's tsunami warning centers at Ewa Beach, Hawaii, and Palmer, Alaska. A series of at-sea buoys that detect water-pressure changes also is planned, to detect tsunamis and determine their size. And research and warning centers are integrating their computer systems, so each can have access to data from the others' arrays of seismometers.Mitigation. The ``tsunami hazard zone'' signs are one example, along with signs marking evacuation routes, informational brochures, school-evacuation drills, warning systems such as sirens, and other local efforts.The ``inundation maps'' offer insights, but aren't intended to dictate land-use planning.``What you can say is that in general, if an earthquake occurs like we envision and if a tsunami is produced like we envision, then this area will probably be flooded,'' Bernard said.``If your house is in the middle of it, that doesn't necessarily mean you're going to get blown away, but I would recommend that you

137.7 3 okay APW19980823.0297 Public perception of a China threat is vital for maintaining support for compulsory military service and the large defense budgets that have enabled Taiwan to overhaul its forces with high tech weaponry from the United States and France. Chiang led weekend battle commemorations on Kinmen, joining veterans in visits to military memorials and graves of some of the approximately 600 soldiers and civilians who died in the conflict, which was followed by two decades of symbolic every-other-day artillery exchanges. President Lee Teng-hui praised the ``glorious sacrifice'' of the conflict's victims in remarks Sunday before a ruling Nationalist Party conference in Taipei. ``It was the victory in the August 23 artillery battle that settled the foundation for (Taiwan's) ensuing 40 years of prosperity,'' Lee told party delegates. One of the Cold War's major flash points, the 1958 battle has become a major tourist draw for Kinmen, aided by the opening up of defunct military installations and clearing of minefields for development. Island residents today hawk kitchen cleavers made from the nearly half a million shells fired at the island during the battle.

137.7 6 okay APW20000316.0013 Between the windswept coastlines of this Taiwanese island and mainland China is a narrow strait of choppy waters, guarded day and night on both sides by soldiers and heavy artillery.But despite the Chinese guns pointing at Kinmen, also known as Quemoy, this military outpost two miles from China seems unworried about Beijing's latest threats of war.''We don't feel the pressure or tension from China anymore. We just go about our business quietly,'' says fisherman Ou Yang Yan-chun, standing beside his fleet of two fishing boats in Kinmen's harbor.''I rarely hear the sound of guns these days,'' says Ou Yang, recalling the 1950s when Kinmen was an almost daily target of a Chinese artillery bombardment.Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist Party held on to Kinmen after it lost mainland China to Mao Zedong's Communists in 1949. Beijing still views Taiwan to be a renegade province that must be taken back by force if necessary.Last month, Beijing issued a new threat, warning that it would attack if Taiwan rebuffed indefinitely talks about reunifying. Military experts often name Kinmen as a target that China might try to take hostage to get the rest of Taiwan to agree to its demands.China's recent harsh words came at a sensitive time, with Taiwan preparing to hold its second direct presidential election on March 18. During the first presidential vote in 1996, China tested nuclear-capable missiles near Taiwan's two largest ports.Campaign buntings and flags provide the few bursts of color against the backdrop of crumbling courtyard homes made of brick and stone. All three of the top candidates have visited Kinmen and have promised development for the military outpost of 50,000 people.Kinmen remains heavily fortified. The few beaches open to the public still have metal spikes jutting out of the waters, and many areas along the coast are still protected by barbed wire signs that read ''Danger Mines.''A makeshift stage has been set up in downtown Kinmen to receive ruling party candidate Vice President Lien Chan, and taxi drivers fly pennants of independent candidate James Soong.Many polls in Taiwan report a growing reluctance for reunification with mainland China, but for residents like Ni chen-kuo, a 47-year old cleaner at Kinmen's harbor, the future lies with the thriving southern Chinese city of Xiamen across the Taiwan Strait.Direct air links from Taiwan to Xiamen would bring more tourists and more jobs, Ni said.''This place is so small, there are so few ways to do business. We really hope the government can start direct links to over there,'' says Ni, pointing to the waters beyond Kinmen harbor's concrete military watchtower.To appease the many businessmen chafing at the restrictions of the ban on direct links with China, Lien has proposed setting up a peace zone in Kinmen and another outlying island, Matsu, to allow direct shipping links with the mainland. But this all depends on China giving Taiwan ''concrete signs of goodwill,'' which Lien hasn't further defined.Legal links with the mainland could make life easier for Mu Chi-lin, 37
