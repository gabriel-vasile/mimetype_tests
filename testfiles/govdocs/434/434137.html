  response to daily stress.</FONT> </P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">The day-to-day 
  stress of dealing with people and their problems, especially the deeply disturbing 
  aspects of dealing with critical incidents, can traumatize officers and poison 
  their spirits. Friederich Nietzsche said, &#147;Whoever fights monsters should 
  see to it that in the process he does not become a monster. And, when you look 
  into an abyss, the abyss also looks into you.&#148;</FONT><SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">4</FONT></SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif"> 
  This aptly applies to the law enforcement profession because officers look into 
  the abyss of evil and negative behavior every day. The quote at the beginning 
  of this article provides insight into what happens to police officers who, during 
  the course of their duties, daily look into the abyss. Although they may face 
  physical jeopardy, their souls remain constantly susceptible to</FONT> <FONT size=2 face="serif">poisoning 
  with each encounter at the edge of the abyss.</FONT> </P>
<P align="left"> <FONT size=2 face="serif">Historically, the law enforcement profession 
  has not acknowledged the negative stress related to being an officer. For example, 
  law enforcement academies throughout the United States rarely have addressed 
  stress in police work. Notwithstanding unmistakable cries for help disclosed 
  in internal reviews, academies have been particularly lax in suggesting appropriate 
  methods for identifying this potentially debilitating disorder. In addition, 
  until recently, many law enforcement agencies did not implement programs to 
  assist officers struggling with stress-related issues. One case, in particular, 
  illustrates this problem all too well.</FONT> </P>
<P align="left"> <B><FONT size=2 face="serif">EXAMINING </FONT></B><B><I><FONT size=2 face="serif">THE

<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">In </FONT><I><FONT size=2 face="serif">The 
  Onion Field</FONT></I><FONT size=2 face="serif">, author Jo-seph Wambaugh described 
  the horrible tale of two Los Angeles police officers&#146; abduction while on 
  duty one night in 1963. Criminals took</FONT> </P>
<P align="left"> <FONT size=2 face="serif">the officers to an onion field outside 
  of Bakersfield, California, and murdered one officer at the feet of the other. 
  Somehow, miraculously, the second officer escaped and survived, only to experience 
  second-guessing by his colleagues and the criminal justice system and incredible 
  effects of negative stress without any assistance or support.</FONT> </P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">The surviving 
  officer not only was victimized by watching his partner murdered but was second-guessed 
  by his colleagues because he escaped and survived. The result was a second victimization. 
  However, in 1963, no critical incident stress management debriefings or employee 
  assistance programs existed, so he had no place to turn for support within his 
  agency. His family members could not support him because no family education 
  programs existed to teach them about the job and its negative stressors. He 
  could not communicate with a police chaplain because his agency had no chaplain 
  program. To make matters worse, a main aspect of the police personality dictated 
  that officers, regardless of traumatic experiences, must endure repeated emotional 
  and physical exposure to the abyss as if nothing had happened. In such an environment, 
  the surviving officer&#146;s agency would not have had meaningful peer discussions 
  or formal peer support programs in place to encourage him to talk about his 
  problems.</FONT> </P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">The case 
  ultimately went to court. For the next 9 years, the surviving officer had to 
  recount the horror of the night over and over again during all of the hearings 
  and appeals of the case. This left an open and infected psychological </FONT><FONT size=2 face="serif">wound 
  that never properly healed so that he could return to duty as a fully functional 
  officer.</FONT> </P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">The gardener 
  was a thief. That&#146;s the thing that bothered him the most... It was getting 
  so hard to remember... something flashed in his mind.... He began getting afraid 
  for no reason...a throbbing pain started at the base of his skull... The fear 
  was weakening him and the pain was ferocious. He wanted to work it off.... Even 
  the pain would not stop the gardener from thinking about his crimes.... He used 
  to think about the night in the onion field... before he became a thief.</FONT><SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">5 
  </FONT></SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">In recounting this true story, Wambaugh 
  described the effects of what has come to be known as post-traumatic stress 
  disorder (PTSD) along with some of the symptoms that someone with PTSD may exhibit. 
  Tragically, the surviving officer ultimately was lost to PTSD and to the law 
  enforcement profession because he became a thief himself by shoplifting some 
  tools that he could have paid for but did not.</FONT> </P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">Fortunately, 
  the law enforcement profession has made great strides since 1963 in the development 
  of programs to treat officers exposed to such horrific incidents. However, room 
  exists for improving these treatment efforts and for enhancing the credibility 
  of such programs so that officers will participate in them. Most important, 
  however, the law enforcement community must remind officers of the negative 
  effects of stress and provide them with the skills to</FONT> <FONT size=2 face="serif">deal 
  with the demands of their profession.</FONT> </P>
<P align="left"> <B><FONT size=2 face="serif">LEARNING FROM THE PAST</FONT></B> 
</P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">The U.S. 
  Department of Justice&#146;s National Institute of Justice conducted research 
  involving one of the major law enforcement agencies in the United States.</FONT><SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">6 
  </FONT></SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">Through an anonymous survey of the officers 
  in this agency, researchers discovered that, apparently, the law enforcement 
  profession had not learned from the history of negative</FONT> <FONT size=2 face="serif">influences 
  of job stress and what that stress does to officers exposed to it. The study, 
  Project Shield, provided information about the negative effects of stress and 
  broke these down into categories of psychological, physical, behavioral, and 
  organizational public health.</FONT> </P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">During 
  this research project, officers admitted anonymously to increased vulnerability 
  to alcohol abuse and anxiety within the first 5 years of employment. Project 
  Shield also found that officers experienced increased risk of mortality</FONT> 
  <FONT size=2 face="serif">and morbidity from cancer, heart disease, hypertension, 
  acute migraine headaches, reproductive problems, chronic back problems, foot 
  problems, and insomnia.</FONT> </P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">Project 
  Shield showed that profound emotional effects from stress occurred most often 
  when officers attended a police funeral, were the subject of an internal affairs 
  investigation, experienced a needle stick or exposure to body fluids, made a 
  violent arrest, or personally knew victims. In addition, the study discovered 
  that officers experienced organizational, or job-related, stress most often 
  when making split-second decisions with serious consequences; hearing media 
  reports of police wrongdoing biased against police; having administrators who 
  did not support their officers; putting work ahead of anything, including family; 
  and not having enough time for personal or family responsibilities.</FONT> </P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">In the 
  psychological area, Project Shield revealed that officers lost energy or interest, 
  including loss of sexual interest, along with experiencing pounding in their 
  chests and feelings of impending doom. Most important, 1 percent of these officers 
  considered ending their lives.</FONT><SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">7 </FONT></SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">Regarding 
  behavioral problems due to negative job stress, officers reported smoking and 
  drinking problems; more injuries; and physical abuse of spouses, children, and 
  even their police partners. Based on the laws associated with police officers 
  convicted of domestic violence having to give up their guns, the potential exists 
  to lose officers to this problem if they are convicted</FONT> <FONT size=2 face="serif">of 
  domestic violence or child abuse. Of course, physically abusing their police 
  partners also can result in tragedy in the workplace.</FONT> </P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">Project 
  Shield demonstrated that whereas only a small percentage of officers in this 
  agency reported these problems, they also were 30 percent more likely to report 
  health problems than other officers in the agency, 3 times more likely to abuse 
  their spouses, 5 times more likely to report alcoholism, 5 times more likely 
  to have somatization (multiple, recurrent, and long-term physical complaints 
  apparently not due to any physical disorder),</FONT><SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">8</FONT></SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif"> 
  6 times more likely to have anxiety, 10 times more likely to be depressed, and 
  the least likely to seek help.</FONT> </P>
<P align="left"> <B><FONT size=2 face="serif">REDUCING AND PREVENTING STRESS</FONT></B> 
</P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">More 
  important than discovering that the negative impact of stress still exists is 
  developing a comprehensive strategy to prevent or reduce it. Sadly, little is 
  being done to inoculate new law enforcement personnel against the poisonous 
  effects of negative stress. One story illustrates the need for action. &#147;There 
  were two doctors standing in the middle of a river. Gradually, dead bodies began 
  coming toward them. At first, there were only a few, and the doctors were successful 
  in pulling them out of the river. Later though, more bodies were coming downstream, 
  and it was becoming impossible to get them all out of the river. At that point, 
  one of the doctors got out of the water and went up on the bank. The other doctor, 
  still in the river, said, &#145;Hey,</FONT> <FONT size=2 face="serif">where 
  are you going? I can&#146;t get all of these bodies out of the water by myself.&#146; 
  With that, the doctor on the bank replied, &#145;I am going upstream to find 
  out who is throwing all of these bodies in the river.&#146;&#148;</FONT><SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">9 
  </FONT></SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">Likewise, the law enforcement profession 
  must go upstream to prevent the negative impact of stress. Prevention, or at 
  least the reduction, of the negative impact of stress proves crucial to the 
  health of law enforcement officers. Comparing stress prevention or reduction 
  to similar efforts, such as crime or disease prevention and reduction, can lead 
  to a better understanding of how to approach the problem.</FONT> </P>
<P align="left"> <B><FONT size=2 face="serif">Crime Prevention Model</FONT></B> 
</P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">Since 
  1970, the National Crime Prevention Institute (NCPI) in Lou-isville, Kentucky, 
  has taught that crime prevention is &#147;the anticipation, recognition, appraisal 
  of a crime risk; and the initiation of some action to remove or reduce it.&#148;</FONT><SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">10</FONT></SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif"> 
  Prior to the advent of a formal crime prevention philosophy at NCPI in 1970, 
  a basic example of</FONT> <FONT size=2 face="serif">such action would have involved 
  officers who worked the midnight shift checking for unlocked or open doors of 
  businesses. When they found a door open or unlocked, they surmised that a thief 
  could enter and steal what was inside. Recognizing this as a crime risk, officers 
  understood that something had to be done to remove this opportunity from the 
  criminal. Therefore, officers would have called the business owner to come and 
  secure the business, which would have removed or at least reduced the opportunity 
  for theft.</FONT> </P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">The law 
  enforcement community can apply this definition of crime prevention to the concept 
  of negative stress reduction by simply substituting &#147;negative stress,&#148; 
  or, more correctly, &#147;distress&#148; (as opposed to eustress or positive 
  stress, such as winning the lottery), in the place of &#147;a crime risk.&#148; 
  Now, officers have a working definition of stress reduction: &#147;the anticipation, 
  recognition, appraisal of distress; and the initiation of some action to remove 
  or reduce it.&#148; Anticipation means that anyone can experience distress. 
  The importance of recognition lies in the awareness of the particular distress 
  that bothers someone the most. Appraisal relates to understanding stress and 
  how it affects people in general and why certain distress bothers a person. 
  With these concepts in mind, the law enforcement community can begin to &#147;initiate 
  some action to remove or reduce it (distress).&#148; To bring the reduction 
  or prevention of negative stress about, however, law enforcement officers first 
  must consider some </FONT><FONT size=2 face="serif">contributing factors inherent 
  in their profession. For example, research in criminal victimization has shown 
  that those who have become victims are never the same as they were prior to 
  their criminal victimization.</FONT><SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">11</FONT></SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif"> 
  Likewise, officers are never the same as they were prior to entering the law 
  enforcement profession. When they come in contact with individuals who have 
  been victimized by criminals, officers also are victimized because people naturally 
  relate to the pain of others. Victims of crime have experienced a violation 
  of their inner selves, and officers easily can empathize because of the realization 
  that this could have happened to anyone. Each time officers encounter this poisonous 
  contact, the potential exists for their spirits to erode. After a period of 
  time, the mind begins to build a wall to protect itself from experiencing any 
  more pain. When this occurs, officers may display cold, unfeeling, or cynical 
  attitudes, even though they do not mean to. To prevent this from occurring, 
  officers need the skills to combat this exposure and avoid becoming sick and 
  dispirited. Anticipation through education may develop a better understanding 
  of how this distress may be contagious and will help to initiate action to guard 
  against this phenomenon.</FONT> </P>

<P align="left"><B><FONT size=2 face="serif">Disease Prevention Model</FONT></B> 
</P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">Just 
  as with the crime prevention comparison, the law enforcement community can borrow 
  the three phases of disease prevention from public health medicine to help in 
  the battle against stress. In the primary phase of disease</FONT> <FONT size=2 face="serif">prevention, 
  doctors focus on educating people who live healthy lifestyles about unhealthy 
  behaviors so that they will not </FONT><I><FONT size=2 face="serif">choose</FONT></I><FONT size=2 face="serif"> 
  to engage in those behaviors and become ill. For example, they teach people 
  who do not smoke about the dangers of smoking so that they will </FONT><I><FONT size=2 face="serif">choose</FONT></I><FONT size=2 face="serif"> 
  not to smoke and, thus, reduce their chances of becoming ill.</FONT> </P>
<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">In the 
  secondary phase of disease prevention, doctors target those individuals engaged 
  in behavior that may lead to disease, but who are still healthy. The doctors 
  attempt to educate these people so that they will stop the dangerous behavior 
  (e.g., smoking) before they contract such ailments as lung cancer, emphysema, 
  or heart disease. The final, or tertiary, prevention phase involves treating 
  sick individuals and educating them to choose not to continue the behavior that 
  resulted in their illness. This represents the most costly phase of the three, 
  and the one that stands the</FONT> <FONT size=2 face="serif">least chance of 
  being effective because treatment usually offers no guarantee of success once 
  a serious illness has developed.</FONT><SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">12 </FONT></SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">If 
  the law enforcement community applies the three phases of public health medicine&#146;s 
  concept of prevention to developing a stress reduction model, then choosing 
  the primary phase makes the most sense. Why wait until the negative influences 
  have broken into a healthy lifestyle and the individual is so sick with stress 
  that the tertiary phase is required to attempt to restore health?</FONT><SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">13 
  </FONT></SUP></P>
<P align="left"><FONT size=2 face="serif">However, even in the secondary phase, 
  officers can choose to &#147;initiate some action to remove or reduce&#148; 
  the negative influences of stress by employing various coping methods. Some 
  of these include deep breathing, muscle relaxation, meditation/prayer, positive 
  thinking and self-talk, and mental imagery.</FONT><SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">14</FONT></SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif"> 
  Officers can choose one of these or use them in combination, whatever works 
  the best. Each person is different and what might work well for one might not 
  work for another. These various techniques do work, and when officers find a 
  technique that works the best, they have to practice it to increase its effectiveness. 
  Most important, officers can refine these coping skills to the point that they 
  can employ them as stressful situations occur.</FONT><SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">15</FONT></SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif"> 
  Using these techniques gives a hopefulness in dealing with most stressful situations 
  and even preventing them from becoming destructive to an officer&#146;s overall 
  health.</FONT> </P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">Practicing 
  stress management also must be used in the context of</FONT> <FONT size=2 face="serif">practicing 
  a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise, wholesome nutrition and diet, 
  spiritual renewal, and enriching social interactions. Officer choices determine 
  the health of the body, mind, spirit, and social interactions. If any one of 
  these four areas sickens, other areas can become ill as well. Conversely, if 
  officers choose to practice a healthy lifestyle in these four areas, then they 
  choose to take care of their bodies.</FONT> </P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">Finally, 
  officers also can choose to think positive thoughts.</FONT><SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">16 
  </FONT></SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">Plato said that &#147;thinking is the 
  soul talking to itself.&#148;</FONT><SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">17</FONT></SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif"> 
  This should be a positive dialogue. Officers should</FONT> <FONT size=2 face="serif">choose 
  to cultivate an energetic, positive, and loving spirit. To help in this effort, 
  they also should choose to associate or interact with others who think and act 
  in a positive manner as well.</FONT> </P>
<P align="left"> <B><FONT size=2 face="serif">CONCLUSION</FONT></B> </P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">As law 
  enforcement officers become healthier, their agencies need to consider their 
  health as well. &#147;Police agencies need to be healthy before they can treat 
  the community&#146;s illnesses and injuries. Signs of good health include pride, 
  self-esteem, quality leadership, comprehensive training, and board certification.&#148;</FONT><SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">18</FONT></SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif"> 
  Also, &#147;...they</FONT> <FONT size=2 face="serif">always should demonstrate 
  an appropriate bedside manner and always practice what they preach.&#148;</FONT><SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">19 
  </FONT></SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">Choosing to be healthy is the best weapon 
  against the negative influences of stress. Once a commitment is made to fight 
  back against the negative factors of stress, life becomes healthier and more 
  enjoyable. Fighting back includes the deliberate adoption and implementation 
  of stress reduction techniques and the vigilance of the law enforcement community 
  to protect its members from the effects of negative stress as vigorously as 
  officers protect society from lawlessness.</FONT> </P>

  ten o&#146;clock in the morning on October 26, 1990, I was working in my office 
  analyzing transcripts and audiotapes of actual hostage negotiation incidents 
  when I received a phone call from an individual I know in a U.S. government 
  agency in Washington, D.C. This individual mentioned that he was working on 
  a threat assessment of a letter he just had received and wanted to know if I 
  could provide a cultural analysis. His primary question was, &#147;Does this 
  letter appear to be an authentic letter written in an Arab cultural style or 
  could it be written by someone trying to appear as an Arab terrorist?&#148; 
  I told him that I could do a cultural analysis of the letter to answer his question. 
  Little did I realize what that simple statement would involve.</FONT><SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">1

  Canada. The writer used the correct names and addresses of the attaches and

  written in capital letters in four sections with the subheadings: &#147;Current 
  Situation,&#148; &#147;Covert Deployment,&#148; &#147;Strategic Warning,&#148;

  cultural assessment (Is there evidence of the cultural background of the letter 
  writer?). My quick briefing by one of these agencies ended when I was informed, 
  &#147;We need to send in our analysis by 5 p.m. today, so we will need your

<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">A cultural 
  analysis is important and can provide a valuable tool for the investigation 
  and analysis of communications, whether those messages are in verbal or written 
  form. All people receive their primary socialization in culture groups, from 
  which they learn specific patterns of perception, meaning, and behavior. These 
  patterns, &#147;because they are learned typically early in life, often are 
  out of awareness and deeply ingrained.&#148;</FONT><SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">3</FONT></SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif"> 
  Further, simply because someone comes from a specific culture group does </FONT><FONT size=2 face="serif">not 
  mean that the individual can recognize these &#147;out of awareness&#148; aspects 
  of perception and behavior. Therefore, identifiable, culturally based patterns 
  of behavior emerge in interaction and communication with others. As an interculturalist 
  (i.e., a specialist in how cultural differences influence behavior and social 
  interaction between individuals and groups), my expertise lies in the identification 
  of these cross-cultural patterns of difference.</FONT> </P>
<P align="left"> <B><FONT size=2 face="serif">Establishing Criteria for Cultural

<P align="left"> <FONT size=2 face="serif">likely indicate the cultural background 
  of the writer. Because these deeper cultural (rather than more surface language 
  translation) elements often are &#147;out of awareness,&#148; evidence of their 
  presence in the communiqu&eacute; is a fairly accurate indicator of the writer&#146;s 
  cultural background or nationality.</FONT> </P>
<P align="left"> <B><FONT size=2 face="serif">Finding Evidence of</FONT></B> </P>

</P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="2">Sometimes, it is common 
  for Arab-English language writing to contain certain errors. One common writing 
  pattern, the Arabic use of the phrase as we all know, reflects a general assumption 
  of common knowledge that may, in fact, not exist.<br>
  Nevertheless, the phrase typically functions among Arab speakers as a linguistic 
  convention for initiating communication. I found no evidence of this pattern 
  in the communiqu&eacute;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">Second, 
  correct use of verb forms and tense often cause difficulties for nonnative speakers 
  of English. For example, the verb </FONT><I><FONT size=2 face="serif">be</FONT></I><FONT size=2 face="serif"> 
  does not exist in Arabic; therefore, Arab writers often confuse tenses or otherwise 
  use this verb improperly. In general, verb tense problems can continue a fairly 
  long time while learning the English language. The communiqu&eacute; writer 
  used such phrases as &#147;A variety of chemi-warfare (CBW) &#145;devices&#146; 
  have been ...&#148;; &#147;All of the aforementioned will be activated immediately...&#148;; 
  soil of Islam continues to be these and other phrases, the writer </FONT><I><FONT size=2 face="serif">have

  be</FONT></I><FONT size=2 face="serif">, and </FONT><I><FONT size=2 face="serif">be</FONT></I><FONT size=2 face="serif"> 
  throughout I found no errors in verb tenses in the and, therefore, saw no evidence 
  of this nonnative English speakers typi-mistakes in subject-verb agreement, 
  it is difficult to determine whether singular or plural. In the communiqu&eacute;, 
  remarkably good job in maintaining verb agreement. For example, &#147;a pack 
  dogs </FONT><I><FONT size=2 face="serif">is</FONT></I><FONT size=2 face="serif"> 
  poised....&#148;</FONT> </P>
<P align="left"> <A name="page_11"></A> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;<font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, nonnative English 
  language speakers often make prepositional errors. Prepositions express relationships 
  typically in space and time between nouns, pronouns, or other words. For example, 
  &#147;He did not want to leave the store during the baseball<br>
  game.&#148; Errors that nonnative English language speakers may make include, 
  for instance, &#147;I picked him out of the train station,&#148; rather than 
  &#147;I picked him up at the train station.&#148; The communiqu&eacute; writer 
  consistently used sentences that reflected the proper<br>
  English language usage of prepositions. For example, &#147;...pack of satanic 
  infidel dogs is poised to strike at the fighting heart of Islam....&#148; Again, 
  I found no evidence of this pattern in the communiqu&eacute;. Fourth, Arab writers 
  of English often use poorly constructed adjective clauses. This occurs with 
  the duplication of basic clause functions in language by a personal pronoun 
  of a function filled by a relative pronoun. Examples of this include: &#147;The 
  car I bought it does not work&#148; or &#147;The man I met him at the station 
  was my friend.&#148; Again, the writer consistently employed English language 
  sentences in which this type of error did not occur.<br>
  </font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="2">Fifth, Arabic relies heavily on coordination, rather 
  than subordination, in sentence construction. Coordination typically can involve 
  stringing or linking a number of separate ideas together with such words as 
  and. This produces very long, complex, multi-idea sentences, which, in English, 
  are better separated with commas and periods. The communiqu&eacute; writer did 
  a remarkably good job of &nbsp;separating various ideas, appropriately using 
  commas<br>
  and ending sentences correctly with periods. For example, &#147;Needless to 
  say, any and all attempts to locate them, via the utilization of current surveillance 
  technology...&#148; and &#147;In recent months, a variety of chemical-biological 
  warfare....&#148; Throughout the document, I found no evidence of this pattern. 
  </font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="2">Finally, sometimes, misspelled words exist that 
  may be spelled phonetically but are not correct. Only one word, appearing in 
  the first line of the text, was misspelled: &#147;At this very moment, a ravenously 
  bllodthirsty pack of satanic....&#148; This misspelling of<br>
  bloodthirsty probably was a typographical error. Therefore, I found no evidence 
  in the communiqu&eacute; of this pattern of misspelling. Overall, the writer 
  appeared highly skilled in the English language and made none of the more common 
  errors that I would expect from someone translating from Arabic to English.</font></P>
<P align="center"><font size="2">Determining Evidence of Deeper Cultural Patterns 
  In Arabic, compared with English, more repetition of a thought (i.e., making 
  the same point several times) occurs. Repetition of an idea functions in Arab 
  cultures to demonstrate sincerity of the writer (or<br>
  speaker) to the message, as well as a marker to distinguish the importance of 
  one idea compared with another idea.5 For example, this might be expressed in 
  more ritualistic statements, such as inshallah (&#147;if God wills it&#148;) 
  and ishkoraallah (&#147;thanks be to God&#148;), as well as in a simple restatement 
  of a message made earlier. I found the language used in the communi-qu&eacute; 
  remarkably clear and succinct in its style. For example, the writer used statements, 
  such as &#147;In order to establish the &#145;bona fides&#146; of this communiqu&eacute;, 
  extremely small but biochemically testable samples of....,&#148; to express 
  rather clearly the message&#146;s intent. Thus, I found no evidence of the Arab 
  pattern of repetition in the communiqu&eacute;. <img src="page11.jpg" width="175" height="148" alt="Photograph of pair of eyeglasses restng o a document"></font></P>
<P align="left"><FONT size=2 face="serif">Second, an Arab cultural a far greater 
  degree of emotion in the a message to demonstrate the personal commitment to 
  the ideas pre-one level, the communiqu&eacute; did contain that might, on the 
  surface, appear to emotional expressiveness. For this very moment, a ravenously 
  pack of satanic dogs is poised to strike at heart of Islam...&#148;; &#147;...the 
  aforementioned have been significantly aided and abetted</FONT> <FONT size=2 face="serif">by 
  a treacherous cabal of traitors to Islam...&#148;; and &#147;Moslem warriors 
  are unafraid of death, because death (for the holy cause) to them means paradise, 
  while death to infidels means only eternal damnation in hell.&#148; </FONT></P>
<P align="left"><FONT size=2 face="serif">The communiqu&eacute; did have statements, 
  such as &#147;ravenously, bllodthirsty, infidel dogs,&#148; which are more highly 
  emotionally charged. However, the letter remained uncharacteristically unemotional 
  concerning the personal feelings and commitments of the writer and &#147;his&#148; 
  people. The purpose of using more highly charged emotional expression within 
  Arab discourse is to demonstrate the writer&#146;s personal commitments and 
  feelings. In this respect, then, the writer did not connect the more emotionally 
  charged language to his or her own viewpoint or actions. In fact, the writer 
  did not use any inclusive terms to suggest that he or she was one of the &#147;Mos-lem 
  warriors.&#148; In the example, &#147;Moslem warriors are unafraid of death...,&#148; 
  the writer did not say what should have been a more natural phrase, &#147;</FONT><I><FONT size=2 face="serif">We</FONT></I><FONT size=2 face="serif"> 
  Moslem warriors are unafraid of death...,&#148; nor did the writer place himself 
  or herself in the picture by saying, &#147;...to </FONT><I><FONT size=2 face="serif">us</FONT></I><FONT size=2 face="serif"> 
  means paradise....&#148; Further, the writer gave a cultural rationale for death 
  in this example. Typically, this would be assumed with no need to &#147;spell 
  it out&#148; to someone else unless the writer wanted to show the reader that 
  he or she knew something about Arab culture and Muslim religion. This represents 
  fairly common information, so it is not particularly insightful.</FONT> </P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">Third, 
  an American pattern of argument places the primary thesis statement at the beginning 
  of a paragraph, whereas an Arabic one puts the main point at the end of a paragraph. 
  This reflects a more general pattern of difference between American (English 
  speakers) and Arab cultures in which Arab patterns of persuasion are found in 
  the form of presentation, rather than the more precise logical structure and 
  evidence of proof.</FONT><SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">7</FONT></SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif"> 
  For example, the writer began the</FONT> <FONT size=2 face="serif">second paragraph 
  of the communiqu&eacute; with a clear thesis statement: &#147;If any part of 
  the Republic of Iraq, including province number nineteen (19) &#145;Kuwait,&#146; 
  is attacked by anyone, for any reason whatsoever, in any manner whatsoever, 
  then all....&#148; In each of the principal paragraphs, the main point was well 
  stated at the beginning. Therefore, I found the logic of the writer clearly 
  more America&#148; than Arab.</FONT> </P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">Fourth, 
  one of the deeper &#147;out of awareness&#148; aspects of cultural programming 
  concerns the use of imagery, metaphors, and</FONT> a<FONT size=2 face="serif">nalogies. 
  Because of this, how individuals employ imagery, metaphors, and analogies can 
  be particularly insightful regarding their cultural identity. The communiqu&eacute; 
  writer used the phrase &#147;...ravenously bllodthirsty pack of satanic infidel 
  dogs....&#148; From the cultural perspective of many Muslims, a dog generally 
  is considered an &#147;unclean&#148; creature; an animal, for example, that 
  they would not have in their home. However, the imagery used by the writer invoked 
  a &#147;</FONT><I><FONT size=2 face="serif">pack</FONT></I><FONT size=2 face="serif"> 
  of dogs.&#148; This is not the primary notion of an Arab cultural view of a 
  dog (e.g., the term </FONT><I><FONT size=2 face="serif">pack of dogs</FONT></I><FONT size=2 face="serif">, 
  or </FONT><I><FONT size=2 face="serif">wolves</FONT></I><FONT size=2 face="serif">, 
  does not appear in Arabic dictionaries).</FONT><SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">8 
  </FONT></SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">In contrast, situations where Americans 
  would think of dogs in a negative sense tend to include those where the animals 
  are wild; run in </FONT><I><FONT size=2 face="serif">packs</FONT></I><FONT size=2 face="serif">; 
  and attack, for example, defenseless deer. Clearly, this negative image of a 
  dog from an American viewpoint is not the same as the negative connotative meaning 
  of the animal from a Muslim or Arab cultural view. Therefore, I found the use 
  of the term </FONT><I><FONT size=2 face="serif">pack</FONT></I><FONT size=2 face="serif"> 
  to describe &#147;infidel dogs&#148; not typical of the Arab or Muslim mind-set. 
  Specifically, it is </FONT><I><FONT size=2 face="serif">not</FONT></I><FONT size=2 face="serif"> 
  that dogs run in &#147;packs&#148; that make them particularly vile to an Arab 
  or Muslim warrior. Yet, the use of the term </FONT><I><FONT size=2 face="serif">pack</FONT></I><FONT size=2 face="serif"> 
  for Americans </FONT><I><FONT size=2 face="serif">is</FONT></I><FONT size=2 face="serif"> 
  critical in characterizing the dog as a vile animal. Thus, I found this particular 
  use of imagery far more characteristic of an American, rather than an Arab, 
  pattern.</FONT> </P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">Finally, 
  a number of words and phrases cast doubt on the Arabic background of the writer 
  and also suggested that the writer was male and at least 45 years of age or 
  older. First, the writer stated that &#147;...the aforementioned infidel dogs 
  have been significantly aided and abetted by....&#148; The phrase </FONT><I><FONT size=2 face="serif">significantly 
  aided and abetted</FONT></I><FONT size=2 face="serif"> is common to American 
  English language speakers. Further, the word </FONT><I><FONT size=2 face="serif">aforementioned</FONT></I><FONT size=2 face="serif"> 
  represents an older English language term for </FONT><I><FONT size=2 face="serif">previously 
  </FONT></I><FONT size=2 face="serif">or &#147;above.&#148; To me, this suggested 
  that the writer possibly was older, perhaps 45 years of age or more. Second, 
  the writer stated that &#147;In recent months, a variety of chemical-biological 
  warfare (CBW) &#145;devices&#146; have been covertly deployed to a strategically 
  significant number of &#145;safe&#146; locations.... These &#145;devices&#146; 
  have been programmed in &#145;fail-safe&#146; modes, so that (if located) any 
  attempt....&#148; The words </FONT><I><FONT size=2 face="serif">devices</FONT></I><FONT size=2 face="serif"> 
  and </FONT><I><FONT size=2 face="serif">fail-safe </FONT></I><FONT size=2 face="serif">illustrated 
  the use of quotation marks to highlight an idea, while </FONT><I><FONT size=2 face="serif">(if 
  located)</FONT></I><FONT size=2 face="serif"> represented one of a number of 
  examples that the writer used of the parenthetical, another sophisticated English 
  language device. Again, the writer used these more sophisticated English language 
  elements properly. Also, the writer&#146;s use of the word </FONT><I><FONT size=2 face="serif">safe 
  </FONT></I><FONT size=2 face="serif">was not typical. Safe, in the context of 
  the communiqu&eacute;, meant a location free from detection, something a person 
  might have read in a spy novel. An Arab national would have had to know this 
  rather uncommon meaning to have used it properly. Finally, the writer used a 
  number of technical terms throughout (e.g., covert deployment and technical 
  verification), possibly reflecting a military background or, more likely, indicating 
  an avid reader of military and spy novels.</FONT> </P>
<P align="left"> <B><FONT size=2 face="serif">Providing the Analysis</FONT></B> 
</P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">Overall, 
  I found no direct evidence that the writer&#146;s English language command was 
  such that typical Arabic errors in English were present in the communiqu&eacute;. 
  The deeper cultural analysis suggested that the writer was an American attempting 
  to sound</FONT> <FONT size=2 face="serif">like an Arab terrorist. The logic 
  of the communiqu&eacute;, the writing style, the use of words, the imagery of 
  the &#147;pack of dogs,&#148; and the technical terminology suggested that the 
  writer was an American male in his 50s. After I submitted my analysis, authorities 
  subsequently apprehended the writer. He was an American white male, in his 50s, 
  living in the United States.</FONT> </P>
<P align="left"> <B><FONT size=2 face="serif">Conclusion</FONT></B> </P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">Traditionally, 
  threat assessments have included both technical feasibility and psychological 
  assessment. What was unique to the analysis of this threat communiqu&eacute; 
  was the additional cultural analysis. This provided a profile that assisted 
  law enforcement authorities in their investigative efforts.</FONT> </P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">In addition 
  to the integration of cultural analysis into overall threatening communication 
  assessments, a targeted communication or discourse-based analysis of these threat 
  messages also should be included as part of a comprehensive assessment procedure 
  to augment more traditional technical feasibility and psychological profiling 
  currently used in law enforcement. This communication and culture approach can 
  prove useful in assessing the degree and intent of threat messages, identifying 
  the writer/communicator, determining the writer&#146;s back-ground (e.g., nationality, 
  age, and sex), and uncovering key message &#147;hot buttons&#148; embedded within 
  the writer&#146;s communication. This significantly can aid law enforcement 
  in selecting persuasive counter-messages more likely to impact the writer&#146;s 
  behavior in predictable ways. Finally, this approach is not limited to assessing 
  written communication.It also can apply to assessments of verbal threat as well.</FONT>

  amount of time managers spend on investigating and resolving work-related personnel 
  problems can be staggering. These problems run the gamut from equal employment 
  opportunity complaints, job performance issues, and personality conflicts to 
  lack of productivity and negative attitudes. Regardless of the problem, the 
  end result, the mission, always suffers. In a majority of instances, these personnel 
  problems share a common thread&#151;poor or no communication between managers 
  and employees. Managers significantly can minimize personnel problems and create 
  a productive and harmonious work environment by using effective communication 
  techniques.</font> </p>
<p align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=2 face="serif">People 
  communicate on two levels: content (the story) and emotion (the feelings). The 
  story (facts and circumstances) constitutes the objective part of communication. 
  On the other hand, the feelings (meaning/significance) people have about their 
  story count most. How people feel about a situation</font> strongly affects 
  their behavior. Therefore, if managers can identify and control emotions, they 
  are in a<br>
  better position to influence other people&#146;s behavior. </p>
<p align="left">While conflict cannot always be resolved, it can be managed. To 
  this end, managers can use a process of maintaining self-control, understanding 
  their employees, and using active listening skills to change employee behavior. 
</p>
<P align="left">MAINTAINING SELF-CONTROL<br>
  People generally agree that it is not what happens to someone in life that counts 
  but how that person reacts to what happens that matters most. Life stressors 
  can be overwhelming at times and may affect the way a person thinks, feels, 
  and behaves.<br>
  Emotions, not reason, may control a person&#146;s behavior. A stressed person 
  may be under the influence of one or more emotions, such as anger, fear, frustration, 
  or depression. If people feel that they have a problem, they do. The manager&#146;s 
  challenge is to restore the employee&#146;s emotional equilibrium.</P>
<P align="left">The only aspect of an interaction that people have absolute control 
  over is their own emotions. Therefore, when confronted with a difficult employee, 
  managers must understand that the first step is not to control the person&#146;s 
  behavior but to control<br>
  their own. If they cannot control themselves, they cannot control the situation. 
  Managers must gauge their own pulse and honestly appraise themselves. Are they 
  emotionally prepared to effectively interact with the employee at that moment? 
  If not, it is far better for them and the employee to reschedule the meeting 
  if possible. </P>

  He further advised, &#147;if you withhold judgements and conclusions long enough

  of what his needs may be and, thereby, how he may be influenced.&#148;</FONT><SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">2 
  </FONT></SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">Managers must be good listeners. Listening 
  is the cheapest, yet most effective, concession they can make to their employees. 
  It gives employees</FONT> <FONT size=2 face="serif">&#147;a hearing&#148; and 
  lets them ventilate. Above all, people </FONT><B></B><FONT size=2 face="serif">want 
  to be understood. Their desire to be understood is as powerful as their need

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">Good listeners

  </FONT><B></B><FONT size=2 face="serif">world through the eyes of another </FONT><FONT size=2 face="serif">person

  statements, such as &#147;I can understand how you would be upset over...&#148; 
  or &#147;You feel as though I did not fully address your issues in my decision,&#148; 
  can help set the proper tone and begin the task of building bridges. Tone of

<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">Managers 
  must listen and let their employees tell them &#147;where it hurts.&#148; Acknowledging 
  a person&#146;s point of view and feelings does not equate to agreement. Managers 
  should try to find some common ground by agreeing wherever they can without 
  conceding. This helps create a positive atmosphere for problem solving. Managers 
  should not argue with their employees. Arguing results in a communication blockade, 
  wherein both parties cease listening to each other and, instead, put all of 
  their energies into defending their positions. People do not always say what 
  they mean. Managers should attempt to listen for the meaning&#151;the unsatisfied 
  needs. Managers are not in the business of solving all problems, but, rather,

<P align="left"><FONT size=2 face="serif">Active listening skills (ALS) are the 
  most effec-a manager can employ to defuse strong restore a subordinate&#146;s 
  emotional When listened to, people tend to listen to more carefully and to evaluate 
  and clarify thoughts and feelings. Managers who use empathy, which enhances 
  rapport employees and, thereby, increases their potential to influence and change 
  a subordinate&#146;s behavior. The eight aspects of ALS involve paraphrasing, 
  emotion labeling, reflecting/mirroring, effective pauses/silence, minimal encouragers, 
  &#147;I&#148; messages, open-ended questions, and summarizing.</FONT> </P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">Paraphrasing 
  is the repeating of the speaker&#146;s &#147;story&#148; (content) in the listener&#146;s 
  own words. Some examples include such phrases as &#147;Are you telling me...?&#148; 
  and &#147;Are</FONT> <FONT size=2 face="serif">you saying...?&#148; This technique 
  provides feedback to clarify content. Additionally, it demonstrates that the 
  manager is listening to and understanding what the employee is saying.</FONT> 
</P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">Emotion 
  labeling tentatively identifies the &#147;feelings&#148; (meaning/significance) 
  of the speaker&#146;s story. Responses, such as &#147;You sound..., You seem..., 
  I hear...,&#148; followed by the emotion the person is exhibiting represent 
  examples of this ALS. When managers emotion label, they show an employee that 
  they </FONT><I><FONT size=2 face="serif">really</FONT></I><FONT size=2 face="serif"> 
  are listening and &#147;tuned into&#148; what the person is experiencing emotionally. 
  This helps identify unsatisfied needs and feelings driving the person&#146;s 
  behavior.</FONT> </P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">Reflecting/mirroring 
  occurs when the listener repeats back the last word or phrase of the speaker&#146;s 
  story. This not only demonstrates both interest and listening but also solicits 
  more information without guiding the direction of the interaction. An employee 
  might say, &#147;I work 12 hours a day, 5 days a week, and no one really cares.&#148; 
  A manager using reflecting/mirroring could respond, &#147;Feel like no one cares, 
  huh?&#148; Effective pauses/silence are best used at appropriate times for effect. 
  People tend to be uncomfortable</FONT> <FONT size=2 face="serif">with silence 
  and will speak to fill dead space in a conversation. Managers can employ silence 
  most effectively just before they say something important or immediately after 
  they have said something important. Silence can help defuse highly emotional 
  employees and also help them understand that conversation is a turn-taking process.</FONT> 
</P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">Minimal 
  encouragers include the gestures or sounds listeners make to let speakers know 
  that they are attentive and focused. These facilitators keep the person talking 
  and do not interfere with the flow of the conversation. Gestures include nodding 
  the head, good eye contact, and leaning forward. Verbal responses might be &#147;uh-huh, 
  yes, I see, okay, oh? when? really?&#148; </FONT></P>
<P align="left"><FONT size=2 face="serif">&#147;I&#148; messages personalize the 
  listener by letting the speaker know how the listener feels and why. This skill 
  provides feedback in a nonthreatening way without putting the person on the 
  defensive. Managers should consider using an &#147;I&#148; message when an employee 
  displays intense emotions, when an employee verbally attacks them, or when they 
  need to refocus an employee. The &#147;I&#148; message format is: I feel (emotion 
  the manager feels) when you (the employee&#146;s behavior) because (the manager&#146;s 
  reason). &#147;I feel frustrated when you become angry with me because I&#146;m 
  doing my best to help&#148; depicts an example of an &#147;I&#148; message.</FONT> 
</P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">Managers 
  can use open-ended questions&#151;usually beginning with how, when, where, and 
  what that employees cannot answer with merely a yes or no&#151;to stimulate 
  conversation. Managers should avoid &#147;why&#148; questions because employees 
  can perceive such inquiries as judgmental or confrontational, resulting in their 
  becoming defensive. Open-ended questions, designed to elicit information without 
  asking numerous questions, include &#147;Can you tell me more about that?&#148; 
  and &#147;Could you help me better understand by explaining that further?&#148; 
  Such questions focus on what the employee thinks and feels.</FONT> </P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">Summarizing 
  puts the speaker&#146;s story and feelings in the listener&#146;s own words. 
  &#147;Let me make sure I understand what you&#146;re saying&#148; followed by 
  a summary</FONT> <FONT size=2 face="serif">of the content and emotions by the 
  listener illustrates summarizing. Managers can use this powerful technique to 
  demonstrate that they are listening and trying to understand. This skill promotes 
  clarification and gives employees the opportunity to reassess their own positions.</FONT>

<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">Although 
  people may not always achieve their objectives, they need to be allowed to save 
  face and maintain some level of dignity. Managers always should maintain their 
  composure when dealing with their subordinates. The manager&#146;s position 
  affords both influence and the &#147;last word,&#148; which managers must use 
  with the utmost discretion. Many managers strive to project power and control.</FONT> 
  <FONT size=2 face="serif">Instead, they need to show that they are open and 
  receptive to subordinates who raise issues of concern with them. Managers must 
  be perceived as being accessible and approachable.</FONT> </P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">The ability 
  to negotiate in the workplace represents a survival skill for managers. The 
  formula for negotiation success involves controlling emotions, using active 
  listening skills to demonstrate understanding, and being genuine and nonthreatening. 
  While not always expected to solve a problem, managers, by listening, fulfill 
  important needs of subordinates by showing respect and giving them an opportunity 
  to voice their concerns. Managers who are creative, flexible, and patient and 
  who demonstrate an ability to negotiate in the workplace can significantly minimize 
  personnel problems and foster a positive work environment. Successful managers, 
  like successful negotiators, are good listeners.</FONT> </P>

  on duty, a shooting occurs in one of the more violent areas of your jurisdiction. 
  As you and your backup respond, the fire department and ambulance are not en 
  route. Or, if you live in a rural community, your dispatcher still is contacting 
  the local volunteer rescue squad. You are the first to arrive on the scene, 
  and you know that the first emergency medical technicians (EMTs) will arrive 
  soon.</FONT> </P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">Law enforcement, 
  fire, and emergency medical services (EMS) work closely together. And, although 
  they have different roles and</FONT> <FONT size=2 face="serif">responsibilities, 
  they respond to many of the same calls. Officers&#146; responsibilities at a 
  medical crime scene consist of securing the scene and investigating the criminal 
  act that caused the injuries. They do not respond to provide direct emergency 
  medical care.</FONT> </P>
<P align="left"> <B><FONT size=2 face="serif">MEDICAL CRIME SCENES</FONT></B> 
</P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">When 
  EMS personnel are dispatched to a scene that has the possibility of violence, 
  they usually request the presence of law enforcement officers as well. In most 
  instances, paramedics will not even respond to the scene until officers</FONT> 
  <FONT size=2 face="serif">have secured it. Securing the scene and protecting 
  the safety of themselves, EMS personnel, and others involved constitute the 
  most important functions of the police at a medical emergency. EMS members cannot 
  properly provide quality medical care if they fear for their safety; they rely 
  on the police to perform this vital function.</FONT> </P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">Even 
  if officers have no medical training and do not directly care for patients, 
  their actions can affect the outcome of an injured person. By quickly securing 
  the scene and relaying vital information to responding medical units, such as 
  the</FONT> <FONT size=2 face="serif">number of patients, types of injuries, 
  and the cause of injury (e.g., vehicle collision), officers indirectly can start 
  the process of quality patient care. In many instances, the law enforcement 
  response takes the first step toward successfully resolving a medical emergency.</FONT> 
</P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">While 
  protecting and serving their communities, police officers encounter a variety 
  of circumstances. Not every criminal act the police come into contact with results 
  from criminal intent. Individuals who become belligerent and physically abusive 
  following a violent assault may react this way due to a head injury, which can 
  increase pressure in their craniums and cause them to act irrationally. Officers 
  should not transport individuals in this condition to jail for assaulting police 
  and rescue personnel. Instead, respondents should take them to an emergency 
  room where medical personnel can determine the type and extent of their injuries.</FONT> 
  <font size=2 face="serif">Officers should attempt to calm the individuals and, 
  if possible, convince them to restrict their movements so that they do not exacerbate 
  any injuries.</font> </P>

  sugar levels will continue to fall and they will pass out, lapse into a coma, 
  and eventually die.</FONT><SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">1</FONT></SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif"> 
  To reverse this condition, responding personnel must give them glucose or an 
  intravenous bolus of glucose. Untrained responders should not attempt these 
  procedures. Officers should summon medical personnel and have them transport 
  these individuals to the hospital. Many chronic alcoholics have numerous medical 
  problems masked by the effects of alcohol. Officers should not assume that the 
  person who</FONT> <FONT size=2 face="serif">appears intoxicated is simply intoxicated; 
  medical problems may cause certain activities.</FONT> </P>
<P align="left"> <B><FONT size=2 face="serif">Hazardous Materials</FONT></B> </P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">Many 
  medical crime scenes contain hazardous materials that most police officers may 
  not be trained or equipped to handle. Because many police departments do not 
  provide their officers with the specialized equipment carried by most fire and 
  EMS personnel, officers must protect themselves and others from these dangers.</FONT> 
</P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">Law enforcement 
  officers always should consider the possibility of the presence of hazardous 
  materials and, although detection may be impossible, a few simple steps can 
  help officers recognize them. Upon arrival, officers should take a few moments 
  to appraise the situation, survey the scene prior to entering, look at the injuries, 
  and attempt to determine their cause. Are smoke or other odors in the air? Are 
  liquids or other materials at the scene hazardous? Are injured persons acting 
  strangely considering the situation? Officers should assume that vehicles and 
  buildings contain hazardous materials until ruled otherwise. Safety remains 
  the priority.</FONT> </P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">If officers 
  arrive on the scene prior to fire department or EMS personnel, they should move 
  people from additional harm and injury, secure the perimeter, and not let anyone 
  in or out until specialized units arrive. They should attempt to contain contaminated 
  materials and individuals, establish an operational area upwind in an uncontaminated 
  location some distance from the hazard zone, and direct incoming</FONT> <FONT size=2 face="serif">units 
  where to set up. Law enforcement officers always should treat the area as a 
  possible crime scene and consider the possibility of additional hazards.</FONT><SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">2</FONT></SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif"> 
  Hazardous materials can complicate matters for even the most highly trained 
  experts. Officer safety should remain paramount to any police officer arriving

  every injured person as if they have a blood-borne disease and guard against 
  unprotected contact with a person&#146;s body fluid, which can contain blood. 
  People can only contract blood-borne diseases from a direct blood-to-blood transmission.

  can transmit diseases. Common blood-borne diseases include HIV and hepatitis.</FONT><SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">4

<P align="left"><FONT size=2 face="serif">The possibility of coming into contact 
  with a person&#146;s body fluid exists at every crime scene. But, by taking 
  certain precautions, individuals virtually can eliminate the chance of contracting 
  a blood-borne disease. Officers always should wear latex gloves or other protective 
  clothing if necessary, avoid contact with another person&#146;s body fluid, 
  and decontaminate any equipment that came into contact with the patient. By 
  following these simple steps, police officers can safeguard themselves against

  terrible events of September 11, 2001, focused all of America, in fact, the 
  world, on the Middle East, the various Arab conflicts, and Islam. For the most 
  part, law enforcement has had little contact with the growing Arab/Muslim community 
  because they are law-abiding, hardworking, family-oriented people seeking the 
  same freedoms and aspirations as other immigrant groups before them. Law enforcement 
  contact with these communities principally has been in administrative areas,

  of law-abiding Muslims and Arab-Americans living in the United States, brought 
  focus upon an otherwise quiescent Arab/Muslim community. Consequently, interactions

  precipitously. To do their jobs effectively, law enforcement officers must understand 
  more about the Arab culture to better interact with this community.</FONT><SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">1</FONT></SUP>

<P align="left"> <B><FONT size=2 face="serif">The Arab Perspective</FONT></B> 
</P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">Twenty 
  countries encompass the &#147;Arab world.&#148; While political diversity among 
  the Arab countries is notable (governmental systems include monarchies, military 
  governments, and socialist republics), they all strongly embrace Islam.</FONT><SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">2</FONT></SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif"> 
  Although vast social differences exist between the various cultures from the 
  Arab world, Arabs are more homogeneous than Westerners in their outlook on life. 
  Most Arabs share basic beliefs and values that cross national or social class 
  boundaries. For example, Islam possibly can influence personal beliefs even 
  among non-Muslims</FONT> <FONT size=2 face="serif">living in the Arab world; 
  child-rearing practices are nearly identical; and the family structure is essentially 
  the same, with a high regard for tradition.</FONT><SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">3 
  </FONT></SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">Similar to other cultures, ethnic identity 
  remains very important for Arabs, regardless of whether they share the same 
  religion. Their ethnicity and cultural background, their native city and country, 
  and where they have traveled are very important to them.</FONT><SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">4 
  </FONT></SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">Likewise, their dignity, honor, and reputation 
  are of paramount importance, and they spare no effort to protect them. Arabs 
  tend to behave in a way that will create a good impression on others.</FONT><SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">5</FONT></SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif"> 
  Loyalty to one&#146;s family takes precedence over personal needs. Social class 
  and family background constitute the major determining factors of personal status, 
  followed by individual character and achievement. As with other cultures, Arabs 
  place great importance on education and learning; many educated people of the 
  Arab world speak several languages, including French and English, in addition 
  to their native tongues.</FONT> </P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">Religion 
  also plays a large part in Arab culture. While Islam is the primary religion, 
  the Arab world consists of Christians and Jews, as well as Bahais, Alaouis, 
  and Zoroastrians. Nevertheless, in this region of the world, God or Allah, plays 
  a vital role, and</FONT> almost everyone acknowledges his power and has some 
  sort of religious affiliation. Muslims tend to believe that humans cannot control 
  all events; some things depend on God (i.e., fate). Religious piety constitutes 
  one of the most admirable characteristics in a person and, unlike most Western 
  governments, a large number of Muslims believe that there should be no separation 
  between &#147;church and state,&#148; the secular and the religious. They believe 
  that religion should be taught in schools and promoted by governments<br>
  because Islam encompasses the social, as well as the spiritual.6</P>

<P align="left">Similar to other cultures, Arabs are generous, humanitarian, polite, 
  and loyal people with a rich cultural heritage dating back thousands of years, 
  as illustrated by their contributions to religion, philosophy, literature, medicine, 
  architecture, art, mathematics, and the natural sciences.7 Nevertheless, many 
  Arabs feel that Westerners have misunderstood and wrongly<br>
  characterized them; they often feel neglected, ignored, or even exploited. For 
  many Arabs, the experience of the Palestinians<br>
  represents the most painful and obvious example of Western indifference or arrogance. 
  Many Arabs view the creation of Israel<br>
  as the capricious imposition of a Jewish state, by the West, at the expense 
  of the Palestinian people, causing their migration (or as they term, diaspora) 
  throughout the Middle East.8 Additionally, many Arabs perceive Westerners as 
  culturally hegemonous, with the propensity to weaken traditional family ties, 
  as well as social and religious values, a potentially corrupting influence on 
  traditional Arab society.9</P>
<P align="left">The male-female relationship for many Arabs remains an important 
  issue in the Middle East. For Arab men, especially those from very traditional 
  backgrounds, discussing business with a woman present may make them ill at ease. 
  At the same time,<br>
  an Arab woman&#146;s tradition may inhibit her from discussing matters with 
  men who are not family members. Even something like shaking hands with a person 
  of the opposite sex is viewed negatively by some Arabs (mostly extremists) unless 
  body language<br>
  implies otherwise. Some believe that if an Arab woman offers to shake hands, 
  it is permissible, but a man never should extend his hand to a veiled woman. 
  Some Muslim men (mostly extremists) will not shake a female&#146;s hand unless

  As with all cultures, the law enforcement approach to Arab-Americans should 
  remain one of respect and dignity, with an appreciation for their historical, 
  cultural, and life experiences. Many come from countries that have seen decades 
  of war (Lebanon) or where capricious regimes have expelled them, which happened 
  to many Palestinians after the Gulf War. Their perceptions of law enforcement 
  often are tainted by these events and how they were treated overseas. For many 
  Arab-<br>
  Americans, a lingering fear exists that they are perceived as terrorists because 
  they are Mus-lims, from the Middle East, or the fact that they dress differently.11 
</P>
<P align="left"> Law enforcement officers need the assistance and cooperation 
  of this vital community. Agencies can develop and encourage<br>
  greater trust and cooperation between the Arab/Muslim community and local, state, 
  and federal law enforcement. As with most immigrant groups, Arab communities 
  want to eliminate crime in their neighborhoods, they want to feel safe, they 
  want their children to thrive, and they do not want to be associated with terrorism. 
</P>
<P align="left">In general, the Arab community willingly assists in investigations. 
  They respond to well-mannered, professional investigators. Oftentimes, they 
  make their homes a comfortable place to conduct interviews by offering tea or 
  coffee and even generous amounts of food. This represents their way of showing 
  hospitality and congeniality. In fact, partaking of refreshments often leads 
  to more open and extended conversations, which, in turn, may prove beneficial 
  to both the Arab and law enforcement situations may require more time and patience 
  because Arabs usually prefer not to &#147;talk business&#148; right away, but 
  engage in friendly conversations first. </P>
<P align="left">To this end, officers should avoid contacting Arab/Muslims on 
  religious holidays or during prayers (devout Muslims pray five times per day 
  and weekly communal prayer is at noon on Fridays).12 Very little eye contact 
  should occur between male law<br>
  enforcement officers and Arab females. For example, the head of an Arab family 
  scolded officers because they repeatedly visually scanned the man&#146;s daughters 
  as they entered the room. Law enforcement officers should refer to the family 
  in the collective, not individually, because for many Arabs, the family constitutes 
  a very private matter, with daughters and wives receiving special considerations. 
  <br>
  <br>
  While in Arab/Muslim homes, law enforcement officers should be respectful of 
  the family hierarchy. They should avoid slouching in chairs or, in particular, 
  baring the soles of their shoes to their hosts. This may not seem important 
  to Westerners,<br>
  but it is very important to many Arabs.</P>
<P align="left">Similarly, shame often becomes a bigger factor than guilt. When 
  possible, officers should conduct interviews in private, allowing for the person 
  to save face if caught in a lie. Investigators can question inconsistencies, 
  but they must offer the interviewee<br>
  room to maneuver and save face so that they are not shamed into not further 
  responding or having to lie in front of others.<br>
</P>
<P align="left"><b>Conclusion </b></P>
<P align="left">Law enforcement officers should remain sensitive to various ethnic 
  groups. They can influence and shape perceptions by professional comportment. 
  Interviewees often willingly tell officers about their backgrounds and their 
  lives. This information canprove educational and enriching, enhance communication, 
  establish empathetic channels, and prepare officers for the next interview where 
  knowledge of the region and customs oftentimes can offer additional investigative 
  opportunities and improve relations between the law enforcement agency and the 
  cultural group.</P>
<P align="left">As terrorism investigations continue, officers involved in these 
  types of investigations should receive additional training or read relative 
  literature to enhance their abilities to deal with this growing community. They 
  will enrich their understanding of a diverse<br>
  and interesting people, though often misunderstood. The Arab community deserves 
  law enforcement&#146;s best efforts and protection, which can be accomplished 
  ably with understanding, dignity, and respect.</P>

<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">F</FONT><FONT size=2 face="serif">reedom...freedom 
  is why most of our ancestors came to this country. While others came in bondage, 
  we fought a terrible war to free the slaves and keep the nation together. We 
  have the freedom to speak our minds, the freedom to write what we believe. We 
  have freedom from tyrants and despots, the freedom to live where we want, the 
  freedom to work at what we love. We have the freedom to send our daughters to 
  school and the freedom for women to go out in public. Women have the freedom 
  to go without a veil or the freedom to wear it if they want. And, for many, 
  there is the freedom to worship&#151;as a Muslim, a Jew, a Buddhist, or a Christian&#151;or 
  not to worship at all.</FONT> </P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">Freedom...the 
  United States of America celebrates the freedom to live, the freedom to dissent, 
  and the freedom to make mistakes. More than 5,000 Americans and many foreign 
  nationals in New York City were freely and innocently making a living in the 
  World Trade Center September 11th. A group of well-funded, narrow-minded disciples 
  of the devil usurped their freedom to exist by murdering them, wantonly destroying 
  families, buildings, aircraft, and businesses. Their lives were </FONT><I><FONT size=2 face="serif">taken</FONT></I><FONT size=2 face="serif"> 
  from them!</FONT> </P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">Then, 
  some groups of people stepped into history against all odds to save others; 
  strangers, some riding hijacked airliners, some working in the damaged buildings, 
  many emergency medical technicians. Many were employees of the New York City 
  Transit Police, the New York City Fire Department, and the New York City Police 
  Department.</FONT> </P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">The day 
  was one of powerful televised images that none of us will forget, but it was 
  the sounds that made such an impression on me. The sound of a 200-ton aircraft 
  hurtling at over 300 miles per hour 1,000 feet above Broadway to its doom. The 
  sound of a 110-story building as it collapsed to the ground. The voice of a 
  physician carrying a video camera as the building came down saying, &#147;Here 
  it comes...Oh, God, I hope I live...I&#146;m sorry I came....&#148; Then, a 
  pause in blackness so that I thought the tape was ended. Then, in the blackness, 
  his voice continued, &#147;It&#146;s a sunny day, but it&#146;s black as night.... 
  Wait! There&#146;s a bit of light.&#148; As the doctor staggers to his feet 
  emerging into the gloom and dust and asks one person if he is all right, there 
  is another sound&#151;actually dozens of sounds. Fweep, fweep, fweep. Sounds 
  that I couldn&#146;t at first make out. The NYPD cruisers were sitting there 
  covered in debris, windows smashed, and people staggering away bewildered. Still 
  that sound&#151;fweep, fweep, fweep. It suddenly came to me what I was hearing. 
  The sounds of &#147;man-down&#148; alarms coming from all of those smashed emergency 
  vehicles and from the firefighters&#146; emergency packs as if they were crying 
  for the dozens of men and women who had just perished.</FONT> </P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">Freedom...freedom 
  is what it is all about. America stands for freedom. Those hundreds of firefighters, 
  police officers, and other volunteers chose freely to go in harm&#146;s way. 
  They could have gone the other way, but they did not! Their lives were not taken. 
  They were </FONT><I><FONT size=2 face="serif">given</FONT></I><FONT size=2 face="serif">! 
  </FONT><I><FONT size=2 face="serif">Freely</FONT></I><FONT size=2 face="serif">! 
  No greater love has a person than they will give their life for another.</FONT> 
</P>
<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">No firefighter 
  or police officer goes to work knowing that he or she will be called upon that 
  day to give it all. These people want to come home at the end of the day. Their 
  families want them home. Our officers did not sign up to fight using the rules 
  of war, but they will accept any challenge. Certainly, a war against terrorism 
  is worth winning. And, unfortunately, this time we are on the front line.</FONT> 
</P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">Almost 
  certainly, the free will suffer more losses. The police and firefighters will 
  continue to stand on the front line in America and do their part. They will 
  stand up to this not-so-new hazard among their</FONT> <font size=2 face="serif">already 
  vast number of duties. There is a reason for this&#151;to help keep the citizens 
  of this nation free. Those who died did their part. Now, as we remember them, 
  it is for the rest of us living to dedicate ourselves to stamping out this evil.</font>

<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">A </FONT><FONT size=2 face="serif">short 
  time ago, we came together unacquainted, yet interrelated in our grand system 
  of justice; an order tasked with the ponderous and foremost burden of humanity&#151;the 
  engagement of evil by good. Today, we part compelled and united in our striving, 
  not by pretense or illusion but by dedication to duty, a tradition of honor, 
  and esprit de corps. Our charge has been strengthened by our mutual resolve, 
  zealous benevolence, and the very truths we hold self-evident&#151;none of which 
  will be shaken.</FONT> </P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">Still, 
  upon return, there will be those in our communities who believe our times and 
  future uncertain. They doubt the duration of America&#146;s bountiful blessings 
  from above. They bear witness to failing families, erred education, and misguided 
  morals, and, because of their consciousness, they cower and cringe. While this 
  is comprehensible, now is not a time for reticence. It is a time for response. 
  My friend the late Dr. W.T. Purkiser said, &#147;To suppose that unruffled seas 
  and blue skies are a token of divine approval is the cruel conceit of those 
  with whom all things go well.&#148;</FONT><SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">1</FONT></SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif"> 
  He further remarked, &#147;An untested faith is an unsure faith. Faith grows 
  strong</FONT> <FONT size=2 face="serif">and steady only as it is exercised against 
  the hard pressures of adverse circumstances.&#148;</FONT><SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">2 
  </FONT></SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">The adverse circumstances are here my 
  friends. But, make no mistake, they always were; only now, the manifestation 
  is distinct and our realization anew. Has our faith been misplaced for the past 
  275 years? Does it lie dormant? I think not. Benjamin Franklin said, &#147;Those 
  things that hurt, instruct.&#148; I say, let us feel the pain, find the lesson, 
  and fight the good fight. The battle against evil, in all of its guises, begins 
  at home. And so, the front line is ours.</FONT> </P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">There 
  always will be evil in the world. Of this I have no doubt, but, likewise, I 
  lack fear. M. Scott Peck insightfully wrote, &#147;There really are people, 
  and institutions made up of people, who respond with hatred in the presence 
  of goodness and would destroy the good insofar as it is in their power to do 
  so. They hate the light and instinctively will do anything to avoid it, including 
  attempting to extinguish it. They will destroy the light in their own children 
  and in all other beings subject to their power. Evil people hate the light because 
  it reveals themselves to themselves. They hate goodness because it reveals their 
  badness;</FONT> <FONT size=2 face="serif">they hate love because it reveals 
  their laziness. They will destroy the light, the goodness, the love in order 
  to avoid the pain of such self-awareness.&#148;</FONT><SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">3</FONT></SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif"> 
  I, for one, am not inclined to afford them the luxury to be evil and ignorant. 
  Instead, I urge it to be our resolve to use each and every day given to abate 
  evil and stay the course for good. This enterprise might seem daunting were 
  we not constituents of such a capable and true assemblage. By no means will 
  our endeavor be in vain.</FONT> </P>

  to be convicted without actually possessing a drug. Additionally, the report

  U.S. Supreme Court has recognized two constitutional sources of the right to 
  counsel during interrogation. One source is the Court&#146;s interpretation 
  in </FONT><I><FONT size=2 face="serif">Miranda v. Arizona</FONT></I><SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">1 
  </FONT></SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">of the Fifth Amendment right against 
  compelled self-incrimination;</FONT><SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">2</FONT></SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">

</P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">This 
  article examines both the Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights to counsel and the 
  underlying principles that support these rights. This article also reviews the 
  Supreme Court&#146;s interpretation of these rights and the effects they have 
  on a law enforcement officer&#146;s ability to engage in interrogation</FONT> 
  <FONT size=2 face="serif">during various stages of a criminal investigation. 
  Finally, suggestions are offered regarding policy considerations that incorporate 
  the protections of the rights to counsel and optimize the potential of obtaining 
  statements that are admissible in court.</FONT> </P>
<P align="left"> <B><FONT size=2 face="serif">Purpose of the Protections</FONT></B> 
</P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">Understanding 
  the protections of the Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights to counsel and the </FONT><FONT size=2 face="serif">concomitant 
  procedural rules begins with an appreciation of the principals that underlie 
  those rights. In </FONT><I><FONT size=2 face="serif">Miranda</FONT></I><FONT size=2 face="serif">, 
  the Supreme Court concluded that custodial interrogation creates an inherently 
  coercive environment that violates the Fifth Amendment protection against compelled 
  self-incrimination. In an effort to reduce the inherent coerciveness, the Court 
  created the now famous </FONT><I><FONT size=2 face="serif">Miranda</FONT></I><FONT size=2 face="serif"> 
  warnings</FONT><SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">4</FONT></SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif"> 
  and required the government to give those warnings and obtain waivers prior 
  to custodial interrogation. The warnings are designed in part to safeguard the 
  right against compelled self-incrimination by ensuring custodial subjects that, 
  if they choose to waive the right to silence, they will not have to face the 
  government alone; they may have the assistance of counsel during interrogation.</FONT> 
</P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">The Sixth 
  Amendment protections, on the other hand, do not relate to the coercive atmosphere 
  of custodial interrogation. Rather, the provisions of the Sixth Amendment are 
  intended to ensure fair prosecutions. Thus, once a criminal case has been initiated,</FONT><SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">5</FONT></SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif"> 
  a defendant has a right to the assistance of counsel at all critical stages</FONT><SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">6</FONT></SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif"> 
  of that prosecution.</FONT> </P>
<P align="left"> <B><FONT size=2 face="serif">Application of the Rights to Counsel</FONT></B> 
</P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">Because 
  the impetus for the creation of the </FONT><I><FONT size=2 face="serif">Miranda</FONT></I><FONT size=2 face="serif"> 
  rights was the Supreme Court&#146;s concern that </FONT><I><FONT size=2 face="serif">custodial 
  interrogations</FONT></I><FONT size=2 face="serif"> are intrinsically coercive, 
  the right to counsel contained within </FONT><I><FONT size=2 face="serif">Miranda</FONT></I><FONT size=2 face="serif"> 
  applies only when the subject of </FONT><I><FONT size=2 face="serif">interrogation</FONT></I><FONT size=2 face="serif"> 
  is in </FONT><I><FONT size=2 face="serif">custody</FONT></I><FONT size=2 face="serif">. 
  The same concern prompted the Supreme Court to</FONT> <FONT size=2 face="serif">determine 
  custody, not from the prospective of the law enforcement officer but, rather, 
  that of the reasonable subject.</FONT><SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">7</FONT></SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif"> 
  Whether or not law enforcement officers believe there is probable cause to arrest 
  is irrelevant to the issue of custody. The determination is based on whether 
  a </FONT><I><FONT size=2 face="serif">reasonable</FONT></I><FONT size=2 face="serif"> 
  person under the circumstances would sense the coerciveness of the environment 
  that </FONT><I><FONT size=2 face="serif">Miranda</FONT></I><FONT size=2 face="serif"> 
  was designed to protect against.</FONT> </P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">Similarly, 
  the Supreme Court has recognized an exception to the </FONT><I><FONT size=2 face="serif">Miranda 
  </FONT></I><FONT size=2 face="serif">requirement when a cellmate informant, 
  either an individual in custody or an undercover law enforcement officer, conducts 
  the &#147;custodial interrogation.&#148;</FONT><SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">8</FONT></SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif"> 
  Because the subjects of cellmate questioning do not know that the government 
  is interrogating them, they cannot feel the coerciveness </FONT><I><FONT size=2 face="serif">Miranda</FONT></I><FONT size=2 face="serif"> 
  was designed to protect against. Consequently, the practice of using cellmate 
  informants does not contravene the </FONT><I><FONT size=2 face="serif">Miranda</FONT></I><FONT size=2 face="serif"> 
  rule.</FONT> </P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">The Sixth 
  Amendment right to counsel, however, does not hinge on the issue of custody. 
  Because the objective of the amendment is to guarantee a fair prosecution, the 
  right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment does not attach until the government 
  signals its commitment to prosecute by the initiation of adversarial judicial 
  proceedings.</FONT><SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">9 </FONT></SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">Once 
  proceedings have begun &#147;by way of formal charges, preliminary hearing, 
  indictment, information or arraignment,&#148;</FONT><SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">10</FONT></SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif"> 
  the defendant, whether in custody or not, has a right to counsel under the Sixth 
  Amendment that has no recognized exceptions.</FONT> </P>

<P align="left"> <B><FONT size=2 face="serif">Scope of the Protections</FONT></B> 
</P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">The scope 
  of the protections of the Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights to counsel likewise 
  reflect the principles underlying those protections. Because the perceived coerciveness 
  of custodial interrogation spawned the </FONT><I><FONT size=2 face="serif">Miranda</FONT></I><FONT size=2 face="serif"> 
  rule, the right to counsel under </FONT><I><FONT size=2 face="serif">Miranda</FONT></I><FONT size=2 face="serif"> 
  protects</FONT> <FONT size=2 face="serif">subjects of custodial interrogation 
  regardless of the topic of interrogation. Whether subjects are questioned about 
  the crimes they were arrested for, or totally unrelated criminal activities, 
  is inconsequential because the rights under </FONT><I><FONT size=2 face="serif">Miranda</FONT></I><FONT size=2 face="serif"> 
  are not crime specific.</FONT> </P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">The Sixth 
  Amendment right to counsel, on the other hand, is crime specific. Because the 
  design of the amendment is to ensure fairness in the prosecution, the protections 
  of the amendment extend only to the crimes with which the subject has been charged. 
  Other uncharged, unrelated crimes, even those growing out of the same fact pattern 
  as the crime or crimes charged, do not fall within the protections of the Sixth 
  Amendment.</FONT><SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">11</FONT></SUP> </P>
<P align="left"> <B><FONT size=2 face="serif">Waiver of Rights</FONT></B> </P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">In one 
  respect, the rights to counsel under both the Fifth and Sixth Amendments are 
  identical. The Supreme Court has placed on the government the burden of proving 
  a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of the right to counsel, regardless 
  of its origin.</FONT><SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">12</FONT></SUP> </P>
<P align="left"> <B><FONT size=2 face="serif">Invocation of the Right to Counsel</FONT></B> 
</P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">Unlike 
  the waiver, the methods and burdens of proving an invocation of the right to 
  counsel under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments vary greatly. With respect to the 
  Fifth Amendment right, the Supreme Court has held that once the government proves 
  a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of the right, the burden shifts 
  to the defense to prove a subsequent clear and unequivocal invocation of the 
  right to counsel.</FONT><SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">13</FONT></SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif"> 
  If a custodial subject</FONT> <FONT size=2 face="serif">makes a vague reference 
  to counsel after initially waiving the </FONT><I><FONT size=2 face="serif">Miranda 
  </FONT></I><FONT size=2 face="serif">rights, it is insufficient to invoke the 
  right to counsel and the government has no obligation to ask clarifying questions.</FONT><SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">14 
  </FONT></SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">An invocation of the right to counsel 
  under the Sixth Amendment neither has to be clear nor unequivocal. The Supreme 
  Court has held that a defendant who requests or accepts the appointment of counsel 
  is, in fact, invoking the protections of the Sixth Amendment.</FONT><SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">15 
  </FONT></SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">Thus, a defendant may, without intending 
  or wanting to, invoke the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.</FONT> </P>
<P align="left"> <B><FONT size=2 face="serif">Duration of Protection</FONT></B> 
</P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">The duration 
  of the protections </FONT><FONT size=2 face="serif">afforded an individual invoking 
  the right to counsel depends on which right is invoked. In </FONT><I><FONT size=2 face="serif">Minnick 
  v. Mis-sissippi</FONT></I><FONT size=2 face="serif">,</FONT><SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">16</FONT></SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif"> 
  the Supreme Court held that an invocation of the right to counsel under </FONT><I><FONT size=2 face="serif">Miranda</FONT></I><FONT size=2 face="serif"> 
  endures as long as the individual invoking that right remains in continuous 
  custody. Unless defense counsel is present, this protection precludes </FONT><I><FONT size=2 face="serif">government-initiated</FONT></I><FONT size=2 face="serif"> 
  interrogation of the subject for the duration of uninterrupted custody.</FONT> 
</P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">The </FONT><I><FONT size=2 face="serif">Miranda</FONT></I><FONT size=2 face="serif"> 
  protection is neither crime nor agency specific. An invocation of the </FONT><I><FONT size=2 face="serif">Miranda</FONT></I><FONT size=2 face="serif"> 
  right to counsel does not only impede future interrogations by the law enforcement 
  agency procuring the invocation. Rather, it precludes </FONT><I><FONT size=2 face="serif">any 
  </FONT></I><FONT size=2 face="serif">representatives of the government from 
  initiating interrogation without the presence of counsel.</FONT> </P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">As a 
  result of the rule in </FONT><I><FONT size=2 face="serif">Minnick</FONT></I><FONT size=2 face="serif">, 
  an invocation of the Fifth Amendment right to counsel provides indeterminate 
  protection. Custodial subjects who invoke the </FONT><I><FONT size=2 face="serif">Miranda</FONT></I><FONT size=2 face="serif"> 
  right to counsel and, thereafter, are released on bond or bail lose the protection 
  of their invocation and may be subjected to government-initiated interrogation 
  at a later date. However, invoking subjects who remain in custody pending trial, 
  or are convicted and sentenced to prison without ever being released from custody 
  continue to benefit from the protections of their invocations for the entire 
  term of imprisonment. Even if they commit crimes while in prison, subjects who 
  invoke the </FONT><I><FONT size=2 face="serif">Miranda</FONT></I><FONT size=2 face="serif"> 
  right to counsel and remain in continuous custody cannot be subjected to government-initiated 
  interrogation without their attorney present.</FONT> </P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">Because 
  the protections of the Sixth Amendment are not related to custody, the duration 
  of an invocation of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is much more predictable. 
  The protections of the Sixth Amendment cease when the prosecution is completed 
  or charges are dismissed. Once invoked, the government cannot</FONT> <FONT size=2 face="serif">initiate 
  interrogation regarding charged offenses through the remainder of the prosecution 
  unless defense counsel is present. However, once the prosecution is concluded 
  or terminated, there are no lingering effects of an invocation under the Sixth 
  Amendment.</FONT> </P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">It is 
  important to note that while invocations of the right to counsel under both 
  the Fifth and Sixth Amendments limit government-initiated interrogations, the 
  Supreme Court has held that the protections of both amendments can be waived.</FONT><SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">17</FONT></SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif"> 
  Thus, while the government may not initiate interrogation under certain circumstances, 
  individuals who previously have invoked either a Fifth or Sixth Amendment right 
  to counsel are able to change their minds and initiate interrogation without 
  the presence of counsel.</FONT><SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">18</FONT></SUP> 
</P>
<P align="left"> <B><FONT size=2 face="serif">Effects of Violations</FONT></B> 
</P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">The Supreme 
  Court has held that statements taken in violation of either the Fifth or Sixth 
  Amendment right to counsel cannot be used in the government&#146;s case in chief 
  or as the principal cause of action. However, such statements are admissible 
  to impeach defendants that take the stand to testify at trial.</FONT><SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">19</FONT></SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif"> 
  The practical effect of obtaining incriminating statements from defendants in 
  violation of their rights to counsel, therefore, is that it prevents them from 
  taking the stand in their own defense.</FONT> </P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">Although 
  obtaining valuable impeachment material is a common goal of law enforcement, 
  officers risk personal liability if they obtain such material through intentional 
  or grossly negligent violations of the</FONT> <FONT size=2 face="serif">Constitution.</FONT><SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">20</FONT></SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif"> 
  Violations of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel have long been recognized 
  as the basis for civil suits against law enforcement officers. Similarly, </FONT><I><FONT size=2 face="serif">intentional</FONT></I><FONT size=2 face="serif"> 
  violations of the </FONT><I><FONT size=2 face="serif">Miranda </FONT></I><FONT size=2 face="serif">rights 
  also have been viewed in the past as sufficient to support civil actions against 
  officers. Most recently, the Supreme Court recognized the </FONT><I><FONT size=2 face="serif">Miranda</FONT></I><FONT size=2 face="serif"> 
  rule as having reached &#147;constitutional proportions.&#148;</FONT><SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif">21</FONT></SUP><FONT size=2 face="serif"> 
  Therefore, even unintentional violations of </FONT><I><FONT size=2 face="serif">Miranda</FONT></I><FONT size=2 face="serif"> 
  that are viewed as grossly negligent may result in successful civil suits against 
  law enforcement officers.</FONT> </P>

</P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">At times, 
  the law as it relates to the Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights to counsel seems 
  like a veritable quagmire. Through training and well-crafted policies, however, 
  many of the common mistakes that lead to the suppression of incriminating statements 
  can be avoided.</FONT> </P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">Because 
  of the disparity in the protections afforded individuals who invoke their rights 
  to counsel under either the Fifth or Sixth</FONT> <FONT size=2 face="serif">Amendment, 
  law enforcement officers must be well trained to recognize which right is being 
  invoked and what limitations the invocation imposes on future investigations. 
  Because of time constraints and other considerations, consulting with prosecutors 
  during the course of interrogations may not always be a viable option.</FONT> 
</P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">Department 
  policy makers should recognize that individuals who invoke their rights to counsel

<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">Moreover,

<P align="left"> <FONT size=2 face="sans-serif">Law enforcement officers are challenged 
  daily in the performance of their duties; they face each challenge freely and 
  unselfishly while answering the call to duty. In certain instances, their actions 
  warrant special attention from their respective departments. The </FONT><I><FONT size=2 face="sans-serif">Bulletin</FONT></I><FONT size=2 face="sans-serif">

<P align="center"><img src="sept02lebx34x1.jpg" border="none" alt="Photograph of Deputy Randy San Nicolas"></P>
<P align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">Deputy 
  Randy San Nicolas of the Adams County, Colorado, Sheriff&#146;s Department responded 
  to a call at an apartment complex regarding an individual sleeping in a car. 
  Upon arrival, he woke the sleeping male, who advised Deputy San Nicolas that 
  he was homeless. After the subject provided his name and date of birth, Deputy 
  San Nicolas returned to his patrol car to check the information. An apartment 
  employee approached him and advised that the subject stated he was going to 
  blow himself up. Deputy San Nicolas returned to the subject&#146;s car and saw 
  that the subject had opened the flow regulator to a portable propane tank and 
  was sitting inside the car with the tank next to him. He had rolled up all of 
  the car windows, locked the car doors, and held a cigarette lighter in his hand. 
  Because numerous citizens were in the immediate vicinity, Deputy San Nicolas</FONT> 
  <FONT size=2 face="serif">began to evacuate the area. Then, after radioing for 
  additional law enforcement and emergency services, he attempted to begin a negotiated 
  conversation with the subject, who held a lighter and yelled that he was not 
  going to cooperate and he was not going to jail. The subject threatened to kill 
  himself and Deputy San Nicolas by blowing up the car. At this time, as the deputy 
  stood 15 feet from the car, the subject lit the lighter and the interior of 
  the car exploded. The subject opened the driver&#146;s side door and got out 
  carrying the propane tank. The subject&#146;s clothing was on fire and the propane 
  tank had flames on its exterior. Deputy San Nicolas ran to the subject and tackled 
  him to the ground. The propane tank was knocked out of the subject&#146;s hand. 
  Assistance arrived and helped Deputy San Nicolas extinguish the subject&#146;s 
  clothing fire and place him in custody. Investigation later revealed several 
  outstanding warrants for the subject&#146;s arrest and a suicide note inside 
  his car. Deputy Randy San Nicolas&#146; professionalism, courage, and ability 
  to remain calm in a high-risk situation saved his own life and the subject&#146;s 
  life and averted danger to numerous innocent citizens.</FONT> </P>
