<P>	Pertinent statutory and regulatory provisions are set out in an appendix
to the petition for a writ of certiorari.  Pet. App. 145a-149a.</P>

<P> STATEMENT</P>

<P>	1.  a.  In the Communications Act of 1934, 47 U.S.C. 151 et seq., Congress
sought &quot;to maintain the control of the United States over all the channels
of radio trans mission&quot; by &quot;provid[ing] for the use of such channels&quot;
under licenses that are granted &quot;for limited periods of time,&quot;
47 U.S.C. 301, and that are issued and renewed only upon a finding that
&quot;the public interest, conve nience, and necessity&quot; will thereby
be served.  47 U.S.C. 309(a), (k)(1)(A).  A broadcast licensee is &quot;granted
the free and exclusive use of a limited and valuable part of the public
domain; when he accepts that franchise it is burdened by enforceable public
obligations.&quot;  CBS, Inc. v. FCC, 453 U.S. 367, 395 (1981) (quotation
marks omit ted).  Among a licensee's public-interest obligations is the
duty not to transmit indecent material during times of the day when children
are likely to be in the audience.  See Enforcement of Prohibitions Against
Broadcast In decency in 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1464, 4 F.C.C.R. 8358, 8358 &para;
2 (1989).</P>

<P>	The duty of licensees to refrain from the broadcast of indecent material
was first set forth in the Radio Act of 1927, ch. 169, &sect; 29, 44 Stat.
1172.  It is now codified at 18 U.S.C. 1464, which makes it unlawful to
&quot;utter[] any ob scene, indecent, or profane language by means of radio
communication.&quot;  As directed by Congress, the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC or Commission) has adopted regulations specifying that indecent
material may not be broadcast between the hours of 6 a.m. and 10 p.m.  47
C.F.R. 73.3999(b) (adopted pursuant to Public Telecommunications Act of
1992, Pub. L. No. 102-356, &sect; 16(a), 106 Stat. 954); see Action for
Children's Televi sion v. FCC, 58 F.3d 654, 669-670 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (en
banc), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1043 (1996) (ACT III).  The Commission does
not regulate indecent broadcasts out side that time period.  The FCC has
authority to enforce the indecency prohibition by, among other things, im
posing civil forfeitures, see 47 U.S.C. 503(b)(1)(B) and (D), or taking
violations into account during license-re newal proceedings, see 47 U.S.C.
307 (2000 &amp; Supp. V 2005); 47 U.S.C. 309(k). </P>

<P>	b.  In FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978), this Court upheld
the constitutionality of the FCC's authority to regulate indecent broadcasts.
 At issue in Pacifica was the midday radio broadcast of George Carlin's
monologue &quot;Filthy Words.&quot;  Responding to a listener complaint,
the Commission determined that the broadcast violated Section 1464.  In
reaching that conclusion, it applied a &quot;concept of 'indecent' [that]
is intimately connected with the exposure of children to language that describes,
in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards
for the broadcast medium, sexual or excretory activities and organs, at
times of the day when there is a reasonable risk that children may be in
the audience.&quot;  Id. at 731- 732 (quoting In re Citizen's Complaint
Against Pacifica Found. Station WBAI (FM), New York, 56 F.C.C.2d 94, 98
(1975) (WBAI)).  As the Court observed, &quot;[t]he Com mission's decision
rested entirely on a nuisance rationale under which context is all-important,&quot;
and that &quot;re quires consideration of a host of variables.&quot;  Id.
at 750. </P>

<P>	In rejecting a constitutional challenge to the Commis sion's enforcement
of Section 1464, the Court explained that, &quot;of all forms of communication,
it is broadcasting that has received the most limited First Amendment protection.&quot;
 Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 748.  That is in part because &quot;the broadcast
media have established a uniquely pervasive presence in the lives of all
Ameri cans&quot; in that &quot;material presented over the airwaves con
fronts the citizen, not only in public, but also in the pri vacy of the
home, where the individual's right to be left alone plainly outweighs the
First Amendment rights of an intruder.&quot;  Ibid.  In addition, the Court
emphasized, &quot;broadcasting is uniquely accessible to children, even
those too young to read,&quot; and the broadcast of indecent language can
&quot;enlarge[] a child's vocabulary in an in stant.&quot;  Id. at 749.
 The Court concluded that &quot;the gov ernment's interest in the well-being
of its youth and in supporting parents' claim to authority in their own
household justified the regulation of otherwise protected expression.&quot;
 Ibid. (internal quotation marks and cita tion omitted); see id. at 762
(Powell, J., concurring).  The Court rejected the contention that &quot;one
may avoid fur ther offense by turning off the radio when he hears inde cent
language,&quot; comparing it to &quot;saying that the remedy for an assault
is to run away after the first blow.&quot;  Id. at 748-749.</P>

<P>	c.	For several years after Pacifica, the Commission enforced the indecency
prohibition only against &quot;mate rial that closely resembled the George
Carlin mono logue,&quot; that is, material that &quot;involved the repeated
use, for shock value, of words similar or identical to those&quot; used
by Carlin.  In re Infinity Broad. Corp. of Penn., 3 F.C.C.R. 930, 930 &para;
4 (1987) (Infinity Reconsideration Order). In 1987, however, the Commission
determined that such a &quot;highly restricted enforcement standard  * 
*  *  was unduly narrow as a matter of law&quot; because it &quot;focus[ed]
exclusively on specific words rather than the generic definition of indecency.&quot;
 Id. at 930 &para; 5.  Accord ingly, the Commission concluded that, in enforcing
Sec tion 1464, it would apply the generic indecency test ar ticulated in
Pacifica, that is, whether the language &quot;de scribes, in terms patently
offensive as measured by con temporary community standards for the broadcast
me dium, sexual or excretory activities or organs, when there is a reasonable
risk that children may be in the audience.&quot;  Id. at 930 &para;&para;
2, 5.1</P>

<P>	In making that change, the Commission recognized that &quot;the question
of whether material is patently offen sive requires careful consideration
of context.&quot;  Infinity Reconsideration Order, 3 F.C.C.R. at 932 &para;
16.  Despite its renewed emphasis on context, however, the Commis sion stated
that &quot;[i]f a complaint focuses solely on the use of expletives  * 
*  *  deliberate and repetitive use  *  *  *  is a requisite to a finding
of indecency.&quot;  In re Pacifica Found., Inc., 2 F.C.C.R. 2698, 2699
&para; 13 (1987).</P>

<P>	The District of Columbia Circuit upheld the Commis sion's decision to
move beyond its narrow post-Pacifica policies.  See Action for Children's
Television v. FCC, 852 F.2d 1332 (1988) (R.B. Ginsburg, J.) (ACT I).  As
the court explained, &quot;[s]hort of the thesis that only the seven dirty
words are properly designated indecent *  *  *  some more expansive definition
must be at tempted.&quot;  Id. at 1338.  Because &quot;[t]he FCC rationally
determined that its former policy could yield anomalous, even arbitrary
results,&quot; and &quot;[n]o reasonable formula tion tighter than the one
the Commission has announced has been suggested,&quot; the court concluded
that the agency had provided an adequate explanation for its policy.  Ibid.2</P>

<P>	d.  In 2001, the Commission issued a policy state- ment to provide further
guidance concerning the inde cency standard.  See In re Industry Guidance
on the Commission's Case Law Interpreting 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1464 &amp; Enforcement
Policies Regarding Broadcast Inde cency, 16 F.C.C.R. 7999, 7999 &para; 1
(2001) (Industry Guid ance).  In that statement, the Commission explained
that it applies a two-part test to determine whether a broad cast is indecent.
 First, the material at issue &quot;must fall within the subject matter
scope of [the] indecency defi nition-that is, the material must describe
or depict sex ual or excretory organs or activities.&quot;  Id. at 8002
&para; 7.  Second, &quot;the broadcast must be patently offensive as measured
by contemporary community standards for the broadcast medium.&quot;  Id.
at 8002 &para; 8.</P>

<P>	The policy statement reiterated that whether a broadcast is &quot;patently
offensive&quot; turns on &quot;the full con text&quot; in which the material
is broadcast and is therefore &quot;highly fact-specific.&quot;  Industry
Guidance, 16 F.C.C.R. at 8002-8003 &para; 9.  The Commission set out three
&quot;princi pal factors&quot; that it considered &quot;significant&quot;
in evaluating patent offensiveness:  &quot;(1) the explicitness or graphic
nature of the description or depiction of sexual or excre tory organs or
activities; (2) whether the material dwells on or repeats at length descriptions
of sexual or excre tory organs or activities; [and] (3) whether the material
appears to pander or is used to titillate, or whether the material appears
to have been presented for its shock value.&quot;  Id. at 8003 &para; 10
(emphases omitted).  With re spect to the second factor, the policy statement
noted that &quot;[r]epetition of and persistent focus on sexual or excretory
material&quot; may &quot;exacerbate the potential offen siveness of broadcasts,&quot;
but that &quot;even relatively fleet ing references may be found indecent
where other fac tors&quot;-such as the use of &quot;graphic or explicit&quot;
lan guage-&quot;contribute to a finding of patent offensiveness.&quot; 
Id. at 8008-8009 &para;&para; 17, 19.  </P>

<P>	e.	In January 2003, the NBC television network broadcast the Golden
Globe Awards.  In accepting the award for Best Original Song, the rock singer
Bono stated:  &quot;This is really, really fucking brilliant.  Really, really
great.&quot;  In re Complaints Against Various Broad. Licensees Regarding
Their Airing of the &quot;Golden Globe Awards&quot; Program, 19 F.C.C.R.
4975, 4976 n.4 (2004) (Golden Globe Awards Order).  The Commission con cluded
that the broadcast of Bono's remark was indecent even though Bono's use
of the F-Word was not &quot;sus tained or repeated.&quot;  Id. at 4980 &para;
12.3  The Commission explained that, even when used merely as an &quot;intensi
fier,&quot; the F-Word falls within the subject-matter scope of indecency
regulation because, given its &quot;core mean ing,&quot; the word &quot;inherently
has a sexual connotation.&quot;  Id. at 4978 &para; 8.  The Commission also
found that Bono's re mark was &quot;patently offensive&quot; because &quot;[t]he
'F-Word' is one of the most vulgar, graphic and explicit descrip tions of
sexual activity in the English language&quot;; its use &quot;invariably
invokes a coarse sexual image&quot;; and its broadcast &quot;on a nationally
telecast awards ceremony[] was shocking and gratuitous.&quot;  Id. at 4979
&para; 9.  The Commission observed that NBC had not claimed that its broadcast
of the word had &quot;any political, scientific or other independent value.&quot;
 Ibid. </P>

<P>	The Commission recognized that its decision &quot;de part[ed]&quot;
from prior cases insofar as they stated that &quot;isolated or fleeting
use of the 'F-Word' or a variant thereof in situations such as this is not
indecent,&quot; and it made clear &quot;that such cases are not good law
to that ex tent.&quot;  Golden Globe Awards Order, 19 F.C.C.R. at 4980 &para;
12.  Instead, the Commission concluded, &quot;the mere fact that specific
words or phrases are not sustained or re peated does not mandate a finding
that material that is otherwise patently offensive to the broadcast medium
is not indecent.&quot;  Ibid.  </P>

<P>	Although the Commission concluded that Bono's re mark was indecent,
it did not impose a sanction.  Be cause &quot;prior Commission and staff
action have indicated that isolated or fleeting broadcasts of the 'F-Word'
such as that here are not indecent,&quot; the Commission deter mined that
NBC &quot;did not have the requisite notice to justify a penalty.&quot;
 Golden Globe Awards Order, 19 F.C.C.R. at 4980, 4982 &para;&para;  12,
15.</P>

<P>	2.  a.  This case arises out of two broadcasts that aired before the
Commission released the Golden Globe Awards Order.  On December 9, 2002,
the Fox television network broadcast the 2002 Billboard Music Awards beginning
at 8 p.m. eastern standard time.  During that broadcast, the entertainer
Cher received an &quot;Artist Achievement Award.&quot;  In her acceptance
speech, she said:</P>

<P>I've had unbelievable support in my life and I've worked really hard.
 I've had great people to work with.  Oh, yeah, you know what?  I've also
had critics for the last 40 years saying that I was on my way out every
year.  Right.  So fuck 'em.  I still have a job and they don't.</P>

<P>Pet. App. 115a-116a.</P>

<P>	The following year, on December 10, 2003, Fox broadcast the 2003 Billboard
Music Awards beginning at 8 p.m. eastern standard time.  Nicole Richie and
Paris Hilton, the stars of Fox's show &quot;The Simple Life,&quot; pre sented
one of the awards.  During their presentation, they engaged in the following
exchange:</P>

<P>Paris Hilton:  Now Nicole, remember, this is a live show, watch the bad
language.</P>

<P>Nicole Richie:  Okay, God.</P>

<P>Paris Hilton:  It feels so good to be standing here tonight.</P>

<P>Nicole Richie:  Yeah, instead of standing in mud and [audio blocked].
 Why do they even call it &quot;The Sim ple Life?&quot;  Have you ever tried
to get cow shit out of a Prada purse?  It's not so fucking simple.  </P>

<P>Pet. App. 69a-71a.</P>

<P>	b.  The Commission received complaints from view ers about both Billboard
Music Awards broadcasts.  See, e.g., J.A. 19 (&quot;My son and I were watching
the 2003 Bill board Music Awards the other night.  *  *  *  [M]y son asked
me what f**king meant.&quot;); J.A. 20 (&quot;It is hard enough to teach
your children manners and decent be havior without showing young adults
on the TV using&quot; expletives.).  It issued an order addressing those
com plaints as well as complaints against numerous other programs, including
(1) several &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; episodes aired by ABC in which, among
other things, a character on the show used the term &quot;bullshit,&quot;
and (2) an episode of CBS's &quot;The Early Show&quot; in which a contestant
on CBS's &quot;Survivor:  Vanuatu&quot; referred to another contes tant
as a &quot;bullshitter&quot; in a live interview.  J.A. 86-109.  The Commission
concluded that each of those four pro grams contained indecent language.
 J.A. 86.  As in the Golden Globe Awards Order, however, the Commission
did not impose any sanction because it concluded that broadcast licensees
lacked adequate notice of its new policy regarding the airing of expletives.
 Ibid.</P>

<P>	c.  Respondents petitioned for review, and the cases were consolidated
in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.  Pet. App.
66a.  At the Commis sion's request, the court of appeals granted a remand
in order to provide the agency an opportunity to address in the first instance
the broadcasters' specific challenges to the Commission's determinations
with regard to their programs.  Id. at 67a-68a.</P>

<P>	d.  On remand, the Commission vacated the relevant portions of its earlier
order.  Pet. App. 68a.  It dismissed the complaints against &quot;NYPD Blue&quot;
on procedural grounds, id. at 129a-131a, and it concluded that the use of
an expletive on &quot;The Early Show&quot; was not indecent because it occurred
in the context of a &quot;news interview,&quot; id. at 125a-128a.  The Commission
explained that, &quot;re gardless of whether such language would be actionable
in the context of an entertainment program,&quot; it was not &quot;actionably
indecent  *  *  *  in this context.&quot;  Id. at 128a.</P>

<P>	At the same time, the Commission reaffirmed its con clusion that the
broadcast of the 2002 and 2003 Billboard Music Awards violated the prohibitions
against the broadcast of indecent material.  Pet. App. 69a-124a.  Applying
the framework set out in the 2001 Industry Guidance, the Commission concluded
that the expletives aired during the Billboard Music Awards were sexual
or excretory references that fell within the subject-matter scope of the
indecency definition.  Fox did not dispute that Richie's use of the S-Word
referred to excrement.  Id. at 73a.  In addition, the Commission reaffirmed
that the F-Word (used by both Richie and Cher) inherently &quot;has a sexual
connotation even if the word is not used literally&quot; because &quot;the
word's power to 'intensify' and offend derives from its implicit sexual
meaning.&quot;  Id. at 73a-74a; see id. at 117a-118a.  The Commission also
con cluded that both broadcasts were &quot;patently offensive.&quot;  Id.
at 74a, 118a, 120a.  With respect to both broadcasts, the Commission found
that the language used was not only graphic and shocking-particularly in
the context of nationally televised awards programs viewed by a substantial
number of children-but was also gratuitous.  Id. at 76a-77a (for the 2003
broadcast, 2.3 million view ers (23.4% of the audience) were under age 18,
and 1.1 million viewers (11% of the audience) were under age 12); 119a-120a
(for the 2002 broadcast, 2.6 million view ers (27.9% of the audience) were
under age 18, and 1.2 million viewers (12.7% of the audience) were under
age 12).  Indeed, the Commission noted, Fox did not argue that the expletives
at issue &quot;had any artistic merit or were necessary to convey any message.&quot;
 Id. at 76a n.44; see id. at 120a n.191.</P>

<P>	As in the Golden Globe Awards Order, the Commis sion rejected the argument
that the fleeting nature of the utterances should preclude a finding that
the lan guage was indecent.  Pet. App. 82a-83a.  The Commis sion explained
that it was &quot;artificial&quot; to maintain a dis tinction between &quot;expletives,&quot;
which had to be repeated to be actionable, and literal &quot;descriptions
or depictions of sexual or excretory functions,&quot; which did not.  Id.
at 82a; see Industry Guidance, 16 F.C.C.R. at 8008, 8009 &para;&para; 17,
19.  As the Commission observed, &quot;[i]n evaluating whether material
is patently offensive, the Commission's approach has generally been to examine
all factors rele vant to that determination.&quot;  Pet. App. 83a.  The
Com mission accordingly found that &quot;categorically requiring repeated
use of expletives in order to find material inde cent&quot; would be &quot;inconsistent
with our general approach to indecency enforcement, which stresses the critical
nature of context.&quot;  Ibid.  The Commission noted that Pacifica did
not require it to &quot;ignore 'the first blow' to the television audience
in the circumstances presented here.&quot;  Ibid.  The Commission also observed
that &quot;grant ing an automatic exemption for 'isolated or fleeting' ex
pletives&quot; would allow broadcasters &quot;to air any one of a number
of offensive sexual or excretory words, regard less of context, with impunity
during the middle of the afternoon provided that they did not air more than
one expletive in any program segment.&quot;  Id. at 84a-85a.  Per mitting
&quot;[s]uch a result,&quot; the Commission explained, &quot;would be inconsistent
with our obligation to enforce the law responsibly.&quot;  Id. at 85a.</P>

<P>	The Commission again declined to sanction Fox be cause &quot;it was
not clear at the time that broadcasters could be punished for the kind of
comment at issue here.&quot;  Pet. App. 122a; see id. at 113a.  It therefore
found no need to address whether the broadcast-inde cency violations were
&quot;willful&quot; within the meaning of 47 U.S.C. 503(b), which authorizes
the Commission to im pose monetary forfeitures for &quot;willful[]&quot;
or &quot;repeated[]&quot; violations of the Communications Act or Commission
rules.  Pet. App. 114a; 124a n.206.  And because it im posed no sanction,
the Commission stated that it would not consider its indecency findings
&quot;to have an adverse impact upon&quot; the Fox stations that participated
in the broadcasts, either &quot;as part of the [license] renewal pro cess
or in any other context.&quot;  Id. at 113a-114a, 124a.</P>

<P>	3.  A divided panel of the court of appeals vacated and remanded.  Pet.
App. 1a-60a.</P>

<P>	a.  The court of appeals concluded that the Commis sion's policy regarding
isolated expletives was &quot;arbi trary and capricious under the Administrative
Proce dure Act&quot; because the Commission had &quot;failed to articu late
a reasoned basis for [its] change in policy.&quot;  Pet. App. 2a.  Taking
the view that the &quot;primary reason for the crackdown on fleeting expletives&quot;
was to protect &quot;viewers (including children)&quot; from the &quot;first
blow&quot; of an expletive, the court of appeals stated that the Commis
sion had failed to provide a &quot;reasonable explanation for why it has
changed its perception that a fleeting exple tive was not a harmful 'first
blow' for the nearly thirty years between Pacifica and Golden Globes.&quot;
 Id. at 25a.</P>

<P>	Even &quot;[m]ore problematic,&quot; according to the court of appeals,
was the fact that &quot;the Commission does not take the position that any
occurrence of an expletive is indecent.&quot;  Pet. App. 25a-26a.  Because
the Commission did not flatly prohibit the broadcast of vulgar expletives
in every circumstance, the court concluded that &quot;the record simply
does not support the position that the Commission's new policy was based
on its concern with the public's mere exposure to this language on the air
waves.&quot;  Id. at 27a-28a.  Even though the court recog nized that any
&quot;per se ban would likely raise constitu tional questions above and
beyond the concerns raised by the [Commission's] current policy,&quot; id.
at 26a n.7, the court nonetheless believed that it was arbitrary for the
Commission to prohibit isolated expletives only in cir cumstances where
their utterance was patently offen sive.</P>

<P>	The court of appeals also took issue with the Commis sion's determination
that an expletive such as the F- Word has an inescapably sexual connotation,
stating that &quot;[t]his defies any commonsense understanding of these
words, which, as the general public well knows, are often used in everyday
conversation without any 'sex ual or excretory' meaning.&quot;  Pet. App.
29a.  In addition, the court dismissed as &quot;divorced from reality&quot;
the Com mission's concern that a &quot;per se exemption for fleeting expletives
would 'permit broadcasters to air expletives at all hours of the day so
long as they did so one at a time.'&quot; Id. at 30a (citation omitted).
 And it faulted the Commission for failing to produce &quot;any evidence
that suggests a fleeting expletive is harmful,&quot; much less that any
such harm was &quot;serious enough to warrant govern ment regulation.&quot;
 Id. at 32a.</P>

<P>	Although the court of appeals &quot;refrain[ed] from de ciding the various
constitutional challenges  *  *  *  raised by the Networks,&quot; it made
certain &quot;observations&quot; regarding the constitutionality of the
Commission's broadcast-indecency policies.  Pet. App. 35a.  In those comments,
which the court described as &quot;dicta,&quot; id. at 35a n.12, the court
&quot;question[ed] whether the FCC's indecency test can survive First Amendment
scrutiny,&quot; id. at 36a.  Nevertheless, because the court decided the
case on the &quot;narrow ground&quot; that the Commission's ex planation
for its policy was arbitrary and capricious un der the Administrative Procedure
Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. 551 et seq., it vacated and remanded &quot;so that the
Com mission can set forth [its] analysis.&quot;  Id. at 45a.</P>

<P>	b.	Judge Leval dissented.  Pet. App. 46a-60a.  In his view, the Commission
had complied with the APA be cause it provided a &quot;sensible&quot; reason
for its &quot;relatively modest change of standard.&quot;  Id. at 49a. 
In addition, he concluded that &quot;[w]hat we have [here] is at most a
differ ence of opinion between a court and an agency,&quot; and that in
light of the Commission's explanation and &quot;the defer ence courts must
give to the reasoning of a duly autho rized administrative agency in matters
within the agency's competence,&quot; there was no basis for the court to
substitute its judgment for the Commission's in this case.  Id. at 58a-59a.</P>

<P>	Judge Leval observed that &quot;the Commission's central explanation
for the change was essentially its perception that the 'F-Word' is not only
of extreme and graphic vulgarity, but also conveys an inescapably sexual
conno tation.&quot;  Pet. App. 49a.  The FCC therefore &quot;concluded that
the use&quot; of that expletive, &quot;even in a single fleeting instance
without repetition,&quot; was &quot;likely to constitute an offense to the
decency standards of &sect; 1464.&quot;  Id. at 50a.  &quot;In other words,&quot;
Judge Leval stated, &quot;the Commission found, contrary to its earlier
policy, that the word is of such graphic explicitness in inevitable reference
to sex ual activity that absence of repetition does not save it from violating
the standard of decency.&quot;  Id. at 52a.</P>

<P>	Unlike the majority, Judge Leval was not troubled by the Commission's
decision not to &quot;follow an all-or- nothing policy.&quot;  Pet. App.
53a.  Instead, he explained that the Commission &quot;attempt[ed] to draw
context- based distinctions, with the result that no violation will be found
in circumstances where usage is considered sufficiently justified that it
does not constitute inde cency.&quot;  Ibid.  Far from an example of &quot;irrationality,&quot;
Judge Leval stated, the policy &quot;is an attempt on the part of the Commission
over the years to reconcile conflicting values through standards which take
account of con text.&quot;  Id. at 54a-55a.  As Judge Leval explained, the
Commission's context-driven approach &quot;is in no way a consequence of
the Commission's change of standard for fleeting expletives.  It applies
across the board to all circumstances.&quot;  Id. at 53a.  Thus, the &quot;majority's
criti cism of inconsistency is not properly directed against the change
of standard here in question,&quot; which &quot;[i]f anything  *  *  * 
has made the Commission more consis tent rather than less&quot; by ensuring
that &quot;the same con text-based factors will apply to all circumstances.&quot;
 Id. at 54a.</P>

<P> SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT</P>

<P>	The court of appeals erred in concluding that the Commission's change
in policy regarding isolated exple tives during times when children are
likely to be in the audience violates the APA.</P>

<P>	Congress has directed the Federal Communications Commission to enforce
the statutory prohibition on the broadcast of &quot;any obscene, indecent,
or profane&quot; lan guage over the public airwaves.  18 U.S.C. 1464.  In
car rying out that duty, the Commission employs a contex tual analysis that
this Court upheld in FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978).  Indeed,
in Pacifica, the Court recognized that &quot;context is all-important.&quot;
 Id. at 750.  Until recently, the Commission made one factor dispositive
in its analysis in certain cases by holding that the utterance of a single
vulgar expletive could not be found indecent, no matter how strongly other
contextual factors weighed in favor of such a finding.  As the Com mission
reaffirmed in the order at issue here, that per se, one-free-expletive rule
was inconsistent with a con text-based approach to broadcast indecency enforce
ment.  In abandoning that rule, the Commission acknow ledged that it was
adopting a new indecency enforce ment policy, declined to impose fines,
and provided a reasoned explanation for the change.  That explanation fully
satisfied the requirements of the APA and is well within the zone of discretion
in which an administrative agency may operate in carrying out its statutory
man date.</P>

<P>	The criticisms by the court of appeals of the Commis sion's change of
policy are unfounded.  Not only do those criticisms rest on an inappropriate
second-guessing of policy judgments committed to the agency by Congress,
they also have less to do with the Commission's revised policy on isolated
expletives than they do with the enter prise of broadcast-indecency enforcement
in general.  In that respect, the analysis of the court of appeals rests
on premises rejected by this Court in Pacifica.</P>

<P>	The court of appeals dismissed the Commission's concern for protecting
audiences likely to include chil dren from the broadcast of a single expletive
because the Commission does not take the position that the broadcast of
vulgar expletives is always indecent.  But nothing in the APA requires the
Commission to operate with the blunt instrument of an &quot;all-or-nothing&quot;
policy in this area; under a contextual analysis, different con texts can
appropriately lead to different results, even where the same word is concerned.
 In any number of ways, the use of an expletive by, for example, a wire
tapped organized-crime figure on a news program is far removed from the
use of the same word in a dialogue on an awards show.  There is no statutory
reason why the FCC is compelled to treat such fundamentally different cases
the same way.</P>

<P>	The court of appeals also erred in dismissing the Commission's determination
that the F-Word has a sex ual connotation even when used in a non-literal
sense as an intensifier or as part of an insult.  The Commission, after
having studied the issue, is in a better position to evaluate the connotations
of language.  As the Commis sion explained, the F-Word is effective when
used to intensify or insult precisely because it has an offensive sexual
connotation.  Moreover, fine points of the distinc tions between denotations
and connotations may be lost on children seeking an explanation of the word's
mean ing from their parents.  The logic of the court's contrary rationale
would suggest that the F-Word and other vul gar expletives should escape
indecency regulation, even if repeated, unless it could be proved that the
intent of the speaker was to use the words in accordance with their literal
meanings.  </P>

<P>	The court of appeals had no basis for demanding that the Commission
demonstrate that broadcasters would flood the airwaves with expletives in
the absence of a change in policy.  It was sufficient for the Commission
to point out that the logic of its prior policy, which would permit the
airing of unlimited expletives one at a time, was inconsistent with responsible
enforcement of the statute.  In any event, making a predictive judgment
on a matter within an agency's realm of expertise is the responsibility
of the agency, not the courts.  Nor was the Commission required to amass
evidence that the broad cast of isolated expletives would be harmful to
children.  The Commission's duty is to enforce the statute that Congress
enacted, not to second-guess the evidentiary basis for its enactment.  In
any event, courts have long recognized that exposure to indecent material
risks harm to a child's psychological and moral development to an extent
that makes it the proper subject of regula tion.  The court of appeals had
no basis to override the Commission's judgment on the risks that isolated
exple tives pose to children during the broadcast times at is sue.</P>

<P>	Finally, because the adequacy of the Commission's explanation for its
revised policy was the only issue ad dressed by the court of appeals, the
Court should re mand the case to allow that court to consider, in the first
instance, respondents' other challenges to the Commis sion's order.  Although
the court of appeals made vari ous &quot;observations&quot; about the constitutional
challenges raised by respondents, it explicitly &quot;refrain[ed] from deciding
[those] constitutional challenges.&quot;  Pet. App. 35a.  And there is no
reason for this Court to depart from its customary practice and reach out
to decide con stitutional questions not passed on below.</P>

<P> ARGUMENT</P>

<P>THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN INVALIDATING THE COMMISSION'S POLICY UNDER
THE APA </P>

<P> A.	The FCC Satisfied The Requirements Of The APA Be cause It Gave
A Reasonable Explanation For Its Changed Enforcement Policy</P>

<P>	As this case comes to this Court it turns on the appli cation of well-settled
principles of administrative law.  Under the APA's arbitrary-and-capricious
standard, &quot;[t]he scope of review  *  *  *  is narrow and a court is
not to substitute its judgment for that of the agency.&quot;  Motor Vehicle
Mfrs. Ass'n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983); see
5 U.S.C. 706(2)(A).  That is no less true when the policy under review re
flects a change in position.  The APA does not lock an agency into a single
view for all time.  Instead, under the APA, a court must uphold an agency's
revised policy so long as the agency has given a reasoned explanation for
the change.</P>

<P>	This case concerns the Commission's policy on the broadcast of certain
expletives during the time when children are most likely to be in the audience.
 The FCC expressly acknowledged that the enforcement policy first announced
in the Golden Globe Awards Order rep resented a reversal of its prior policy,
which had effec tively imposed a per se rule under which isolated exple
tives could not be deemed indecent.  The Commission accordingly refrained
from imposing fines for the viola tions.  The Commission gave several reasons
for the change, including that the revised policy harmonized the treatment
of expletives with the Commission's general approach to indecency enforcement,
under which con text is &quot;all-important,&quot; Pacifica, 438 U.S. at
750, and no one factor is dispositive.  The agency's explanation fully satisfied
the requirements of the APA, and the court of appeals erred in setting aside
the Commission's order.</P>

<P> 1.	The APA permits an agency to change its policy as long as it provides
a reasonable explanation for doing so</P>

<P>	The APA does not require &quot;[r]egulatory agencies [to] establish
rules of conduct to last forever.&quot;  State Farm, 463 U.S. at 42 (quoting
American Trucking Ass'ns v. Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co., 387
U.S. 397, 416 (1967)).  To the contrary, this Court has recognized that
&quot;[a]n agency's view of what is in the public interest may change, either
with or without a change in circum stances.&quot; Id. at 57 (quoting Greater
Boston Television Corp. v. FCC, 444 F.2d 841, 852 (D.C. Cir. 1970), cert.
denied, 403 U.S. 923 (1971)). Indeed, far from being locked into one position
by the APA, an agency has an obligation to reconsider &quot;the wisdom of
its policy on a continuing basis.&quot;  NCTA v. Brand X Internet Servs.,
545 U.S. 967, 981 (2005) (quoting Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. NRDC, 467 U.S.
837, 863-864 (1984)).</P>

<P>	When an agency changes its policy, the APA requires only that it &quot;supply
a reasoned analysis for the change.&quot;  State Farm, 463 U.S. at 42. 
That analysis may show that the change is required by changed circumstances.
 But an agency also may alter its policy for the simple reason that, in
its judgment, the &quot;prior policy failed to implement properly the statute.&quot;
 Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 187 (1991); see Brand X, 545 U.S. at 981
(ex plaining that an agency may make a policy change &quot;in response to
changed factual circumstances, or a change in administrations&quot;) (citation
omitted).  The &quot;discretion provided by the ambiguities of a statute&quot;
is left &quot;with the implementing agency,&quot; not the reviewing court.
 Smiley v. Citibank (S.D.), N.A., 517 U.S. 735, 742 (1996). </P>

<P> 2.	The Commission acknowledged its change in policy </P>

<P>	As the court of appeals recognized, Pet. App. 20a- 21a, the Commission
expressly acknowledged that its abandonment of a per se rule requiring that
expletives be repeated in order to be indecent represented a change in policy.
 In the Golden Globe Awards Order, the Commission noted that &quot;prior
Commission and staff action have indicated that isolated or fleeting broadcasts
of the 'F-Word'  *  *  *  are not indecent or would not be acted upon,&quot;
and it explained &quot;that any such interpreta tion is no longer good law.&quot;
 19 F.C.C.R. at 4980 &para; 12.  The Commission further stated:  &quot;We
now depart from  *  *  *  cases holding that isolated or fleeting use of
the 'F-Word' or a variant thereof in situations such as this is not indecent.&quot;
 Ibid.  Instead, the Commission ex plained, &quot;the mere fact that specific
words or phrases are not sustained or repeated does not mandate a find ing
that material that is otherwise patently offensive to the broadcast medium
is not indecent.&quot;  Ibid.</P>

<P>	In the order at issue here, the Commission elabo rated on its statements
in the Golden Globe Awards Or der.  It explained that the decisions that
had established a per se rule &quot;that expletives had to be repeated to
be indecent&quot; were &quot;seriously flawed&quot; and were &quot;appropri
ately disavowed.&quot;  Pet. App. 82a-83a.</P>

<P>	Respondents suggest that the Commission said in its order &quot;that
its indecency policy had not changed and that no reasoned basis for that
change was required.&quot;  Fox Br. in Opp. 15; see NBC Br. in Opp. 17.
 That claim ignores the relevant portions of the Commission's or ders, and
it overlooks that the Commission acknowl edged its change in policy not
only in its words but also in its actions.  The Commission did not sanction
Fox for either broadcast at issue here, and, in the case of the 2002 Billboard
Music Awards, the only reason for its forbearance was its recognition that
&quot;it was not clear at the time that broadcasters could be punished for
the kind of comment at issue here.&quot;  Pet. App. 122a; see id. at 124a
&amp; n.206.  In sum, the Commission's orders reflect a candid recognition
that the Golden Globe Awards Order represented a change in policy-one that
the Commission determined would better serve its stat utory obligation to
protect children from exposure to indecent broadcasts during the times of
the day they are most likely to be in the audience.</P>

<P> 3.	The Commission provided a reasonable explanation for the change
in policy</P>

<P>	Before the Golden Globe Awards Order, the Commis sion's indecency policy
was largely to ignore context when an expletive was not repeated.  In the
Golden Globe Awards Order and in the order at issue here, the Commission
concluded that such a categorical exception or safe harbor was not warranted.
 The Commission of fered three reasons for that conclusion, and its explana
tion fully satisfies the deferential standard of the APA.</P>

<P>	a.  The &quot;most important[]&quot; reason for its change in policy,
the Commission explained, was that &quot;categori cally requiring repeated
use of expletives in order to find material indecent is inconsistent with
our general approach to indecency enforcement, which stresses the critical
nature of context.&quot;  Pet. App. 83a.  The effect of the Commission's
pre-Golden Globe Awards Order pol icy was to treat one contextual factor-&quot;whether
mate rial had been repeated&quot;-as &quot;decisive&quot; regardless of
whether other factors (such as the explicitness or shock ing nature of the
material) contributed to the patent offensiveness of the broadcast.  Id.
at 83a.  That result was &quot;at odds&quot; not only &quot;with the Commission's
overall enforcement policy,&quot; ibid., but also with the contextual inquiry
mandated by this Court's decision in FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S.
726 (1978).</P>

<P>	In Pacifica, this Court upheld the Commission's au thority to regulate
broadcast indecency under &quot;a nui sance rationale under which context
is all-important.&quot;  438 U.S. at 750; see id. at 742 (plurality opinion)
(noting that &quot;indecency is largely a function of context-it can not
be adequately judged in the abstract&quot;).  As the Court explained, because
a &quot;nuisance may be merely a right thing in the wrong place,-like a
pig in the parlor instead of the barnyard,&quot; the application of the
inde cency standard to a particular broadcast &quot;requires con sideration
of a host of variables,&quot; including the &quot;time of day,&quot; &quot;the
language  *  *  *  used,&quot; and &quot;the composition of the audience.&quot;
 Id. at 750 (quoting Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., 272 U.S. 365, 388 (1926)).
 Consistent with Pacifica, the Commission has implemented a policy for enforcing
federal indecency restrictions that looks to &quot;the full context in which
the material appear[s].&quot;  In dustry Guidance, 16 F.C.C.R. at 8002 &para;
9.  For example, &quot;[e]xplicit language in the context of a bona fide
news cast might not be patently offensive, while [in another context] sexual
innuendo that persists and is sufficiently clear to make the sexual meaning
inescapable might be.&quot;  Id. at 8002-8003 &para; 9 (footnote omitted).</P>

<P>	As Judge Leval observed, the Commission's revised policy &quot;has made
the Commission more consistent rath er than less, because under the new
rule, the same con text-based factors will apply to all circumstances.&quot;
 Pet. App. 54a.  The revised policy is also more faithful to the text of
the governing statute, which prohibits the broad cast of &quot;any  *  *
 *  indecent  *  *  *  language.&quot;  18 U.S.C. 1464 (emphasis added).
 &quot;Read naturally, the word 'any' has an expansive meaning, that is,
'one or some indiscriminately of whatever kind.'&quot;  United States v.
Gonzales, 520 U.S. 1, 5 (1997) (quoting Webster's Third New International
Dictionary 97 (1976)).  The word &quot;any&quot; does not lend itself to
a safe-harbor policy in which some indecency is permitted if it is not repeated.
 Under the Commission's revised policy, the statute can be applied to the
broadcast of any indecent language, regardless of whether particular words
are repeated.  </P>

<P>	b.  The Commission also explained its change in pol icy by noting this
Court's rejection in Pacifica of the argument that one could fully protect
oneself-or, more to the point, one's children-from indecent program ming
&quot;by turning off the broadcast upon hearing inde cent language.&quot;
 Pet. App. 84a.  &quot;To say that one may avoid further offense by turning
off the radio when he hears indecent language,&quot; the Court stated, &quot;is
like say ing that the remedy for an assault is to run away after the first
blow.&quot;  Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 748-749.  The Com mission likewise concluded
that &quot;granting an automatic exemption for 'isolated or fleeting' expletives
unfairly forces viewers (including children) to take 'the first blow'&quot;
of vulgar expletives in circumstances in which their use is patently offensive.
 Pet. App. 84a.  Particu larly given that some of the complaints that the
Commis sion received with respect to the broadcasts at issue in this case
concerned the impact of isolated expletives on children, it was appropriate
for the Commission to take into account the full impact that a &quot;first
blow&quot; may have in this context.  See, e.g., J.A. 15 (&quot;My son asked
me Mommy what is f[]ing?&quot;); J.A. 19 (&quot;My son and I were watching
the 2003 Billboard Music Awards the other night.  *  *  *  [M]y son asked
me what f**king meant.&quot;); J.A. 20 (&quot;It is hard enough to teach
your children man ners and decent behavior without showing young adults
on the TV using&quot; expletives.).</P>

<P>	c.  Finally, the Commission observed that a blanket exemption for isolated
expletives &quot;would as a matter of logic permit broadcasters to air expletives
at all hours of a day so long as they did so one at a time.&quot;  Pet.
App. 84a-85a.  &quot;For example,&quot; the Commission noted, &quot;broad
casters would be able to air any one of a number of of fensive sexual or
excretory words, regardless of context, with impunity during the middle
of the afternoon pro vided that they did not air more than one expletive
in any program segment.&quot;  Id. at 85a.  &quot;Such a result,&quot; the
Commission rightly concluded, &quot;would be inconsistent with our obligation
to enforce the law responsibly.&quot;  Ibid.4</P>

<P> B.	The Court Of Appeals Erred In Substituting Its Judg ment For That
Of The FCC</P>

<P>	The court of appeals gave three reasons for rejecting the Commission's
explanation of its change in policy.  First, the court concluded that the
Commission's objec tive of restricting the broadcast of nonrepeated vulgar
expletives was inconsistent with its actual policy, which takes account
of context in determining whether the use of those expletives is patently
offensive.  Pet. App. 25a- 28a.  Second, the court disputed the Commission's
con clusion that a broadcast containing the F-Word could be indecent even
when the word is not used literally to de scribe sexual activity.  Id. at
29a-30a.  And third, the court disputed the factual underpinnings for the
agency's policy.  Id. at 30a, 32a-33a.  </P>

<P>	None of those reasons withstands scrutiny.  Instead, all three rest
on a failure to appreciate the limited scope of review under the APA in
reviewing agency policy de terminations such as this.  In addition, they
have little to do with the Commission's change of policy on isolated expletives,
but instead appear to reflect hostility to the agency's longstanding treatment
of indecency in gen eral.  In that respect, the reasoning of the court of
ap peals is incompatible with this Court's decision in Paci fica.  The court
of appeals may consider respondents' constitutional challenges to the Commission's
order once it has cleared respondents' statutory objections, but the Commission's
efforts to give effect to the reasoning of Pacifica provide no basis for
second-guessing its deter mination under the APA.</P>

<P> 1.	The Commission's consideration of context in deter mining offensiveness
does not undermine its conclu sion that an isolated expletive may be indecent</P>

<P>	In its analysis of the FCC's change in policy, the court of appeals
concentrated on the Commission's statement that granting an automatic exemption
for a single utterance of an expletive &quot;unfairly forces viewers (including
children) to take 'the first blow.'&quot;  Pet. App. 84a.  According to
the court, &quot;the 'first blow' theory&quot; -which this Court itself
credited in Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 748-749-&quot;bears no rational connection
to the Commis sion's actual policy regarding fleeting expletives&quot; be
cause &quot;the Commission does not take the position that any occurrence
of an expletive&quot; is indecent.  Pet. App. 26a. </P>

<P>	Because it focused on the &quot;first blow&quot; concept, the court
of appeals did not address the principal rationale behind the Commission's
change in policy:  the desire to make the implementation of the contextual
approach to indecency determinations more consistent by no longer making
one factor dispositive in a particular category of cases.  The Commission's
policy simply takes into ac count that some blows are likely to be more
harmful to the audience (including children) than others, and even more
to the point, that in some contexts a first blow can be sufficient.  The
&quot;first blow&quot; metaphor recognizes that in certain contexts even
a single word can be so offen sive that it should be subject to regulation;
that is why a one-free-expletive rule is incompatible with the proper application
of a contextual analysis.  As the Commission explained-but the court of
appeals ignored-the &quot;most important[]&quot; reason for the Commission's
decision here was the &quot;inconsisten[cy]&quot; between the contextual
ap proach and a categorical rule requiring repetition of expletives.  Pet.
App. 83a.  </P>

<P>	The Commission's failure to &quot;take the position that any occurrence
of an expletive is indecent,&quot; Pet. App. 26a, is a necessary consequence
of a meaningful contex tual analysis.  Judge Leval was therefore correct
when he observed that the court's criticism &quot;is not properly directed
against the change of standard&quot; but instead against the entire contextual
approach to indecency en forcement.  Id. at 54a.  For example, the court
looked to the Commission's finding that the use of expletives in a broadcast
of the film &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; did not make the broadcast indecent,
and it inferred that the Commission must not be &quot;concern[ed] with the
public's mere exposure to this language on the airwaves.&quot;  Id. at 27a-28a.
 But the expletives in &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; arose in a much different
context and in any event were repeated.  Accordingly, if the non-indecency
finding with respect to the repeated expletives in &quot;Saving Private
Ryan&quot; makes the Commission's indecency finding with respect to the
Billboard Music Awards broadcasts irra tional, it would equally preclude
an indecency finding with respect to any broadcast of repeated expletives,
such as the Carlin monologue. </P>

<P>	Contrary to the reasoning of the court of apeals, the FCC's contextual
approach is appropriate because the context in which a word is used is relevant
in determin ing whether the word is offensive.  Judge Leval illus trated
the point well when he observed that the judges of the court of appeals
had used the F-Word at oral ar gument:  &quot;Had the case been on another
subject, such usage would surely have seemed inappropriate.  Because of
the issues in this case, the word was central to the issues being discussed.
 It is not irrational to take con text into account to determine whether
use of the word is indecent.&quot;  Pet. App. 54a n.16.  In other words,
&quot;con temporary community standards&quot; recognize that a word that
is appropriate in some contexts-such as an oral argument in an indecency
case-may be &quot;patently offen sive&quot; in others-such as a prime-time
awards show when children are in the viewing audience.  Industry Guid ance,
16 F.C.C.R. at 8002 &para; 8.  Nothing in the APA pre vents the Commission
from reaching-or enforcing- that common-sense conclusion.</P>

<P>	Additionally, when offensive language is used in cer tain contexts-such
as a news program-countervailing First Amendment interests may be at stake,
making it appropriate for the Commission to &quot;proceed with the utmost
restraint.&quot;  Pet. App. 127a.  The court of appeals was therefore wrong
to criticize the FCC for its decision to &quot;excuse an expletive&quot;
that occurred during a &quot;news interview.&quot;  Id. at 26a (quoting
id. at 128a).  Agencies are not required to pursue their policies at all
costs and in disregard of competing interests, nor are they prohib ited
from recognizing that those interests may be greater in some contexts than
in others.  Id. at 54a-55a (Leval, J., dissenting) (FCC has properly &quot;reconcile[d]
conflicting values through standards which take account of context.&quot;);
see FCC v. National Citizens Comm. for Broad., 436 U.S. 775, 809-811 (1978);
cf. Chevron, 467 U.S. at 865-866.  In the news context, there is a counter
vailing interest in respecting &quot;the editorial judgments of broadcast
licensees&quot; in presenting news programming, and the Commission properly
took that interest into account.  Pet. App. 126a-127a (quoting In re Branton,
6 F.C.C.R. 610, 610 (1991)).</P>

<P>	This Court endorsed the Commission's contextual approach in Pacifica.
 In that case, the Court upheld the Commission's authority to regulate broadcast
indecency precisely because &quot;[t]he Commission's decision rested entirely
on a nuisance rationale under which context is all-important.&quot;  438
U.S. at 750; see ibid. (indecency de termination &quot;requires consideration
of a host of vari ables&quot;).  As Justice Stevens explained, &quot;the
constitu tional protection accorded to a communication contain ing such
patently offensive sexual and excretory lan guage need not be the same in
every context.&quot;  Id. at 747 (plurality opinion).  Instead, &quot;[i]t
is a characteristic of speech such as this that both its capacity to offend,
and its 'social value'  *  *  *  vary with the circumstances&quot;; thus,
&quot;[w]ords that are commonplace in one setting are shocking in another.&quot;
 Ibid.  &quot;Because content of that character is not entitled to absolute
constitutional pro tection under all circumstances,&quot; Justice Stevens
wrote, &quot;we must consider its context in order to determine whether
the Commission's action was constitutionally permissible.&quot;  Id. at
747-748; see id. at 742 (&quot;indecency is largely a function of context&quot;
and &quot;cannot be ade quately judged in the abstract&quot;); id. at 761
(Powell, J., concurring) (agreeing that &quot;on the facts of this case,
the Commission's order did not violate respondent's First Amendment rights&quot;)
(emphasis added).  In short, the FCC's contextual analysis was crucial to
this Court's endorsement of the Commission's determination in Pacifica.5</P>

<P>	According to the court of appeals, a contextual ap proach to fleeting
expletives bears &quot;no rational connec tion&quot; to the goal of protecting
broadcast audiences from the &quot;first blow.&quot;  Pet. App. 26a.  But
the Commission's goal was not protecting audiences from a first blow simpliciter,
but rather to protect them from indecency, which in some contexts could
involve a single blow.  Moreover, there is no inherent tension between a
&quot;first blow&quot; theory and a consideration of context and, in ef
fect, the potential impact of that blow.  Indeed, it was this Court in Pacifica
that first analogized the broadcast of indecent language to the &quot;first
blow&quot; of an assault, 438 U.S. at 748-749, even as it recognized that
the same language in a different context-e.g., &quot;a two-way radio conversation
between a cab driver and a dispatcher, or a telecast of an Elizabethan comedy,&quot;
id. at 750-might not be legally indecent.  Moreover, in the discussion of
Paul Cohen's famous jacket, id. at 747 n.25, 749, Justice Stevens made clear
that context could matter in evaluat ing a single use of an expletive. 
See id. at 750 n.29.</P>

<P>	The supposed inconsistency identified by the court of appeals in this
case was a necessary consequence of the Commission's application of the
analysis embraced by this Court in Pacifica.  The court of appeals may enter
tain respondents' constitutional challenges to the Com mission's order once
the court has properly resolved the statutory challenges to that order.
 But the Commis sion's effort to give effect to the rationale of Pacifica
provides no basis for invalidating its determination un der the APA.  Indeed,
if anything, an agency's efforts to give effect to this Court's decisions
should call for more, not less, deference to its judgments.</P>

<P> 2.	The Commission reasonably concluded that vulgar expletives need
not be used in a literal sense to be indecent</P>

<P>	The court of appeals also disagreed with the Commis sion's judgment
that vulgar expletives can be indecent even when they are not used literally.
 According to the court, the &quot;FCC's change in policy cannot be based
on a categorical view that 'any use of [the F-Word] or a varia tion, in
any context, inherently has a sexual connotation,' because  *  *  *  the
Commission permits even numerous and deliberate uses of that word in certain
contexts.&quot;  Pet. App. 28a n.9 (quoting Golden Globe Awards Order, 19
F.C.C.R. at 4978 &para; 8) (citation omitted).  That state ment reflects
a misunderstanding of the Commission's reasoning.  The Commission's determination
that the F- Word &quot;has a sexual connotation even if the word is not
used literally,&quot; id. at 74a, 118a, means only that the word falls within
the subject-matter scope of the Com mission's indecency definition-in other
words, that it satisfies the first part of the two-part indecency test.
 It does not represent a determination that the broadcast of that word is
always patently offensive, satisfying the second part of the test.  There
is thus no inconsistency between the Commission's determination that the
F- Word has an inescapably sexual connotation and its deci sions that have
found some broadcasts of the word not indecent.  </P>

<P>	The court of appeals also believed that the Commis sion's conclusion
that the F-Word always has a sexual connotation was &quot;unsupported by
any record evidence and contradicted by the evidence submitted by the Net
works.&quot;  Pet. App. 30a n.10.  The court pointed to exam ples that,
in its view, showed that the F-Word can be employed &quot;in everyday conversation
without any 'sexual or excretory' meaning,&quot; id. at 29a, including Bono's
statement at the Golden Globe Awards and Vice Presi dent Cheney's use of
the F-Word in a conversation with Senator Patrick Leahy, id. at 29a-30a.
 That observation is of limited relevance to this case, since it is undisputed
that at least one of the expletives at issue was used in a literal sense.
 Id. at 71a.</P>

<P>	More fundamentally, the court's criticism was misdi rected, because
the Commission was well aware that the F-Word may be used &quot;for emphasis
or as an intensifier,&quot; Pet. App. 73a, or &quot;as a metaphor to express
hostility,&quot; id. at 120a, and that when it is employed in such con texts
it &quot;is not used literally,&quot; id. at 74a.  The Commis sion did not
conclude that every use of the F-Word is a literal sexual reference.  Rather,
it determined that &quot;the word's power to insult and offend derives from
its sexual meaning,&quot; id. at 118a, and that any use of the F-Word therefore
&quot;has a sexual connotation,&quot; ibid. (emphasis added); see id. at
74a n.39 (citing American Heritage College Dictionary 559 (4th ed. 2002));
id. at 74a n.40 (citing Robert F. Bloomquist, The F-Word:  A Jurispru dential
Taxonomy of American Morals (In a Nutshell), 40 Santa Clara L. Rev. 65,
98 (1999) (&quot;all F-word usage has at least an implicit sexual meaning&quot;)).
 The court of appeals erred in overriding that determination.</P>

<P>	As Judge Leval observed, &quot;the Commission did not mean that every
speaker who utters [the F-Word] in variably intends to communicate an offensive
sexual meaning,&quot; but that &quot;even when the speaker does not intend
a sexual meaning, a substantial part of the com munity, and of the television
audience, will understand the word as freighted with an offensive sexual
connota tion.&quot;  Pet. App. 58a.  Of course, the force of that &quot;offen
sive sexual connotation&quot; is precisely why the word is effective when
used as an intensifier or an insult.  See Steven Pinker, The Stuff of Thought:
 Language As a Window Into Human Nature 369 (2007) (&quot;If you're an English
speaker, you can't hear [words such as the F- Word] without calling to mind
what they mean to an im plicit community of speakers, including the emotions
that cling to them.&quot;); Timothy Jay, Why We Curse:  A Neuro-Psycho-Social
Theory of Speech 136 (2000) (&quot;Curse words are different&quot; from
ordinary words &quot;in that the connotative meaning dominates over the
deno tative meaning.&quot;).  And whatever subtle non-literal meanings the
F-Word might have to an adult, a child impressed by the use of a new word
and asking for an explanation of the word's meaning may be less im pressed
with subtle distinctions between denotations and connotations or between
literal and figurative uses.</P>

<P>	Both the FCC and this Court have long recognized the inherent sexual
meaning of the F-Word.  For exam ple, the expletives in the Carlin monologue
were mostly used in a non-literal sense-indeed, one of Carlin's prin cipal
themes was that the F-Word &quot;leads a double life,&quot; literal and
non-literal, a theme he illustrated with nu merous examples of phrases employing
the F-Word (and other expletives) non-literally.  Pacifica, 438 U.S. at
754.  Nevertheless, in determining that the broadcast of the monologue was
indecent, the Commission made no effort to parse the transcript to identify
specific lit eral uses of expletives or to give the non-literal uses a free
pass.  Instead, it concluded that, as a general mat ter, the F-Word and
the S-Word &quot;depict sexual and ex cretory activities and organs in a
manner patently offen sive by contemporary community standards.&quot;  WBAI,
56 F.C.C.2d at 99 &para; 14.  This Court treated the broadcast the same
way.  See Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 739 (noting that &quot;[t]he Commission
identified several words that re ferred to excretory or sexual activities
or organs,&quot; but without distinguishing between the literal and non-lit
eral uses of those words); id. at 745 (plurality opinion) (describing Carlin's
monologue as &quot;a broadcast of pa tently offensive words dealing with
sex and excretion&quot;).</P>

<P>	That is not to say that an expletive's literal or non- literal use is
not part of the relevant context in deter mining whether the use of an expletive
is patently offen sive.  Once again, the court of appeals appears to have
taken one strand of the Commission's reasoning and treated it as if it were
somehow an end in itself, when in reality the Commission's goal is a context-specific
in quiry that does not exclude potentially patently offen sive remarks based
on a per se rule.  Moreover, like its criticisms of the FCC's consideration
of context, the court of appeals' statements about non-literal uses of expletives
have little to do with the Commission's change of policy with regard to
isolated expletives.  In stead, under the court's reasoning, the Commission
would lack authority to regulate any non-literal uses of offensive sexual
or excretory terms, no matter how many times they are deliberately repeated
and no mat ter what time of day the broadcast takes place.  That counter-intuitive
result is inconsistent with Pacifica and the Commission's statutory responsibilities
to regulate indecency, and nothing in the APA requires the Com mission to
adopt it.</P>

<P> 3.	The court of appeals erred in second-guessing the  Commission's
judgment that a change in its inde cency enforcement policy was appropriate</P>

<P>	Finally, the court of appeals concluded that the Com mission's revised
policy was unnecessary.  Seizing upon the Commission's observation that
a blanket exemption for isolated expletives &quot;would as a matter of logic
permit broadcasters to air expletives at all hours of a day so long as they
did so one at a time,&quot; Pet. App. 84a-85a, the court opined that because
&quot;broadcasters have never bar raged the airwaves with expletives even
prior to Golden Globes,&quot; id. at 30a, the suggestion that they might
do so was &quot;both unsupported by any evidence and directly contradicted
by prior experience,&quot; id. at 30a n.11.   The court also objected that
the record &quot;is devoid of any evi dence that suggests a fleeting expletive
is harmful, let alone establishes that this harm is serious enough to warrant
government regulation.&quot;  Id. at 32a.  Neither rationale represents
a proper basis for setting aside the agency's predictive judgment on such
matters.</P>

<P>	a.  Retaining an automatic exception to the indecency prohibition for
nonrepeated expletives would, at least as a logical matter, undeniably allow
broadcasters to air &quot;one expletive in any program segment.&quot;  Pet.
App. 85a.  Regardless of whether, or to what extent, the regulated community
might exercise self-restraint and not avail itself of a one-free-expletive
rule, it was appropriate for the Commission to consider where the logic
of the broad casters' argument would extend, and to conclude that the result
&quot;would be inconsistent with [its] obligation to enforce the law responsibly.&quot;
 Ibid.  Section 1464 broadly prohibits the broadcast of &quot;any&quot;
indecent lan guage, and the Commission could reasonably conclude that its
prior policy of requiring repetition where exple tives were involved &quot;failed
to implement properly the statute.&quot;  Rust, 500 U.S. at 187.</P>

<P>	Moreover, it was well within the Commission's dis cretion to make a
predictive judgment about the conse quences of such a rule on a going-forward
basis.  There was ample evidence to support the proposition that the broadcast
of vulgar expletives would increase in the ab sence of a change in policy.
 In the Golden Globe Awards Order, the Commission cited a study that found
that &quot;of fensive&quot; language had increased significantly on broad
cast television between 1990 and 2001.  19 F.C.C.R. at 4979 &para; 9 n.26;
see Barbara K. Kaye and Barry S. Sapolsky, Watch Your Mouth!  An Analysis
of Profan ity Uttered by Children on Prime-Time Television, 7 J. Mass Commc'n
&amp; Soc'y 429, 441 (2004) (finding that &quot;of fensive&quot; language
was used 98 times on major broadcast networks between 8 and 9 p.m. in 1990,
but 216 times on the same networks during the same hour in 2001).  And the
House Committee considering the Broadcast De cency Enforcement Act of 2005,
Pub. L. No. 109-235, 120 Stat. 491, noted another study that showed that
offen sive &quot;language increased overall during every timeslot between
1998 and 2002&quot; and that &quot;[f]oul language during the 'family hour'
increased by 94.8 percent between 1998 and 2002 and by 109.1 percent during
the 9 p.m. time slot.&quot;  H.R. Rep. No. 5, 109th Cong., 1st Sess. 2 (2005).
 The Commission could reasonably anticipate that the trend would continue
in the absence of any regulatory change.  See Pet. App. 56a-57a (Leval,
J., dissenting).6</P>

<P>	As this Court has explained, when an agency makes judgments of a &quot;predictive
nature,&quot; &quot;complete factual support in the record for the Commission's
judgment or prediction is not possible or required&quot;; instead, &quot;a
fore cast of the direction in which future public interest lies necessarily
involves deductions based on the expert knowledge of the agency.&quot; 
National Citizens Comm., 436 U.S. at 813-814 (quoting FPC v. Transcontinental
Gas Pipe Line Corp., 365 U.S. 1, 29 (1961)); see Public Citizen, Inc. v.
NHTSA, 374 F.3d 1251, 1260-1261 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (&quot;Predictions regarding
the actions of regu lated entities are precisely the type of policy judgments
that courts routinely and quite correctly leave to admin istrative agencies.&quot;)
(quoting Public Utils. Comm'n of the State of Cal. v. FERC, 24 F.3d 275,
281 (D.C. Cir. 1994)).  The court of appeals erred in overriding the agency's
predictive judgment here.</P>

<P>	b.  The court of appeals also refused to uphold the Commission's change
in policy because the Commission had failed to produce &quot;any evidence
that suggests a fleeting expletive is harmful, let alone establishes that
this harm is serious enough to warrant government reg ulation.&quot;  Pet.
App. 32a.  But 18 U.S.C. 1464, which pro hibits the broadcast of &quot;any
obscene, indecent, or pro fane language,&quot; does not require the Commission
to compile evidence showing that the language to which it applies is otherwise
harmful; harm has already been presumed by Congress.  The Commission's duty
is to enforce the statute enacted by Congress, not to conduct its own investigation
of whether the statute is necessary or advisable as a policy matter.  When
Congress's intent is clear, that is the end of the matter.</P>

<P>	That the Commission previously followed a different policy does not
suggest that the agency had determined that the broadcast of a single expletive
was harmless; instead, the pre-Golden Globe Awards Order decisions embodied
a policy that a single expletive did not warrant the exercise of the Commission's
enforcement authority.  See Industry Guidance, 16 F.C.C.R. at 8008-8009
&para; 18.  The decision below resulted from the Commission's deci sion
to recalibrate that policy to more &quot;responsibly&quot; en force federal
prohibitions against indecent broadcasting.  Pet. App. 85a.  The Commission's
earlier exercise of its discretion to forbear from enforcing Section 1464
in single-expletive cases does not disable it from enforcing the statute
now.  Reevaluating the threat posed by cer tain regulated conduct is precisely
the sort of thing that responsible agencies do in carrying out their statutory
mandate, and nothing in the APA stands in the way of such diligence.</P>

<P>	More importantly, this Court has never insisted that an agency must
amass evidence of harm to minors be fore it may enforce regulations designed
to protect their well-being.  In Pacifica, for example, the Court upheld
the Commission's indecency determination even though there was no evidence
of any harm caused by the Carlin monologue.  Instead, the Court found a
sufficient basis for regulation in the commonsense observations that &quot;broadcasting
is uniquely accessible to children, even those too young to read,&quot;
and that written messages &quot;incomprehensible to a first grader,&quot;
when broadcast, can &quot;enlarge[] a child's vocabulary in an instant.&quot;
 Paci fica, 438 U.S. at 749; see J.A. 15 (viewer complaint re garding the
2003 Billboard Music Awards) (&quot;Mommy what is f[]ing?&quot;).  The Commission
was not required to conduct further proceedings to arrive at the inescapable
conclusion that such language presents a threat to chil dren in the audience.</P>

<P>	Likewise, in Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629 (1968), the Court upheld
a statute prohibiting the sale of material obscene as to minors, even while
it recognized that the link between exposure to obscenity and the &quot;ethical
and moral development of our youth&quot; was not &quot;an accepted scientific
fact.&quot;  Id. at 641.  As the District of Columbia Circuit has observed,
&quot;Congress does not need the testimony of psychiatrists and social scientists
in order to take note of the coarsening of impressionable minds that can
result from a persistent exposure to sex ually explicit material.&quot;
 ACT III, 58 F.3d at 662.  To the contrary, &quot;the Supreme Court has
never suggested that a scientific demonstration of psychological harm is
re quired in order to establish the constitutionality of mea sures protecting
minors from exposure to indecent speech.&quot;  Id. at 661-662.  Under this
Court's precedents, the court of appeals had no basis for demanding that
the Commission identify further &quot;evidence&quot; of harm caused by the
expletives at issue.</P>

<P> C.	This Court Should Remand To Allow The Court Of Ap peals To Consider
Respondents' Other Challenges To The FCC's Order</P>

<P>	Before the court of appeals, respondents presented several additional
challenges to the FCC's order, argu ing among other things that Section
1464's indecency prohibition violates the First Amendment.  Pet. App. 18a.
 Because the court of appeals did not rule on those challenges, this Court
should remand to allow the court of appeals to consider them in the first
instance.  See Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 718 n.7 (2005) (declin
ing to reach issues that &quot;were not addressed by the Court of Appeals,&quot;
because &quot;we are a court of review, not of first view&quot;); see also
Fox Br. in Opp. 19 (&quot;[I]f this Court were to  *  *  *  reverse the
Second Circuit's ad ministrative law holding, the Court would still have
to remand the case to the Second Circuit to permit it to consider Fox's
scienter and constitutional arguments.&quot;).</P>

<P>	To be sure, the panel majority made a variety of &quot;ob servations&quot;
about the constitutional issues raised by respondents.  Pet. App. 35a. 
It specifically &quot;refrain[ed] from deciding&quot; those issues, however,
and its comments were concededly &quot;dicta.&quot;  Ibid.; id. at 35a n.12.
 It is well settled that this Court reviews &quot;judgments, not state ments
in opinions.&quot;  California v. Rooney, 483 U.S. 307, 311 (1987) (per
curiam) (quoting Black v. Cutter Labs., 351 U.S. 292, 297 (1956)).  &quot;That
admonition has special force when the statements raise constitutional ques
tions,&quot; because it is the Court's &quot;settled practice to avoid the
unnecessary decision of such issues.&quot;  Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 734; see
Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U.S. 288, 347 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring).</P>

<P>	Consideration of respondents' constitutional argu ments at this stage
would be especially inappropriate in light of the rule that a &quot;cross-petition
is required  *  *  *  when the respondent seeks to alter the judgment be
low.&quot;  Northwest Airlines, Inc. v. County of Kent, 510 U.S. 355, 364
(1994).  In this case, the judgment below vacated the Commission's order
and remanded to the Commission &quot;for further proceedings in accordance
with&quot; the court's opinion, Pet. App. 144a-that is, for further proceedings
aimed at &quot;provid[ing] a reasoned analysis&quot; for the Commission's
policy, id. at 34a.  But if respondents were to prevail on their constitutional
chal lenges, they would be entitled to a different judgment that would provide
them with broader relief.  Having elected not to file a cross-petition,
respondents are pre cluded from raising their constitutional challenges
in this Court.  See Board of Trs. of the State Univ. of N.Y. v. Fox, 492
U.S. 469, 485 (1989).</P>

<P>JUNE 2008</P>

<P>1		Thus, the Commission found that certain broadcasts of the Howard Stern
show would have been actionably indecent under its indecency standards as
clarified because they involved &quot;not merely an occasional off-color
reference,&quot; but an &quot;explicit&quot; discussion of  &quot;matters
sexual and excretory, in a pandering and titillating fashion,&quot; even
though they did not employ &quot;the specific words used in the Pacifica
case.&quot;  In re Infinity Broad. Corp. of Penn., 2 F.C.C.R. 2705, 2706
&para;&para; 10, 11 (1987).</P>

<P>2		In a later portion of the same decision, the District of Columbia
Cir cuit remanded the Commission's tentative determination that indecent
material could be broadcast only after midnight, finding that the Com mission
had &quot;failed to consider fairly and fully what time lines should be
drawn.&quot;  ACT I, 852 F.2d at 1341.  Thereafter, the court invalidated
a congressional directive to enforce Section 1464 &quot;on a 24 hour per
day basis.&quot;  Action for Children's Television v. FCC, 932 F.2d 1504,
1507 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (ACT II) (emphasis omitted), cert. denied, 503 U.S.
913, 914 (1992).  It later upheld a 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. statutory safe harbor
for indecent broadcasts.  See ACT III, 58 F.3d at 656; Public Telecommuni
cations Act of 1992, Pub. L. No. 102-356, &sect; 16a, 106 Stat. 954.  The
FCC's current regulations provide that &quot;[n]o licensee of a radio or
television broadcast station shall broadcast on any day between 6 a.m. and
10 p.m. any material which is indecent.&quot;  47 C.F.R. 73.3999(b).</P>

<P>3		The FCC's Enforcement Bureau had initially ruled that the broad cast
was not indecent because Bono used the F-Word &quot;as an adjective or expletive
to emphasize an exclamation,&quot; and because the remarks were &quot;fleeting
and isolated.&quot;  See In re Complaints Against Various Broad. Licensees
Regarding Their Airing of the &quot;Golden Globe Awards&quot; Program, 18
F.C.C.R. 19,859, 19,861 &para;&para; 5-6 (2003).  The Golden Globe Awards
Order reversed that staff decision.</P>

<P>4		The Commission's revised policy is further supported by the 2006 enactment
of the Broadcast Decency Enforcement Act of 2005 (BDEA), Pub. L. No. 109-235,
120 Stat. 491.  The BDEA substantially increased the maximum forfeitures
that may be levied against licensees that broadcast &quot;obscene, indecent,
or profane language.&quot; &sect; 2, 120 Stat. 491 (to be codified at 47
U.S.C. 503(b)(2)(C)(ii)).  The BDEA was enacted after the Commission released
the Golden Globe Awards Order, yet Congress expressed no disagreement with
the FCC's revised policy. To the contrary, the House Report cited Bono's
remark during the Golden Globe Awards and Nicole Richie's remarks during
the 2003 Billboard Awards as evidence of the need for more rigorous enforce
ment of the broadcast-indecency prohibition.  H.R. Rep. No. 5, 109th Cong.,
1st Sess. 2 (2005).  That Congress had these broadcasts in mind when it
decided to increase the FCC's forfeiture authority provides additional evidence
that the Commission's revised policy falls within its authority under Section
1464.  Cf. FDA v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 120, 143
(2000).</P>

<P>5		NBC errs when it asserts (Br. in Opp. 25) that the Pacifica Court
did not consider whether context was relevant to indecency determina tions,
because the case involved only &quot;concededly indecent speech.&quot; 
In fact, one of the questions before the Court was whether the broadcast
of Carlin's monologue was indecent.  See Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 738-739 (&quot;The
only other statutory question presented by this case is whether the afternoon
broadcast of the 'Filthy Words' monologue was indecent within the meaning
of &sect; 1464.&quot;); id. at 739 (noting &quot;Pacifica's claim that the
broadcast was not indecent within the meaning of the statute&quot;); id.
at 741 (finding &quot;no basis for disagreeing with the Commission's conclu
sion that indecent language was used in [the] broadcast&quot; of Carlin's
monologue).</P>

<P>6		The Commission had experienced a similar phenomenon before 1987, when
its enforcement policy was that &quot;no action was taken unless [the broadcast]
involved the repeated use, for shock value, of words similar or identical
to those satirized in the Carlin 'Filthy Words' mono logue.&quot;  Infinity
