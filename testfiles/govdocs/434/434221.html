   <b>Utah Federal Court Permits CFTC to Add Parties And Expand Allegations in Existing
   Commodity Pool Fraud Case</b>
  </p>
  <p>
   WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) announced
   today that on January 16, 2003, Judge Ted Stewart of the U.S. District Court for the
   District of Utah granted the CFTC&#8217;s motion to add two defendants and expand its
   fraud claims in a case already pending before that court, captioned <u>CFTC v. Birma,
   Ltd., et al.</u>, Civil Action No. 2:00CV00622ST. The new defendants are <b>Donald J.
   Purser</b>, a Salt Lake City attorney, and <b>Thomas E. Jones</b>, an Oregon resident.
  </p>
  <p>
   The CFTC originally filed its six-count complaint on August 8, 2000 (<u>see</u> CFTC
   News Release <a href="../../opa/enf00/opa4437-00.htm" shape="rect">4437-00</a>, August 22, 2000), and on
   September 25, 2000, obtained a preliminary injunction against defendants <b>Stephen W.
   Brockbank</b> of Salt Lake City, <b>Carol J. Love</b> of West Jordan, Utah, and
   <b>Birma, Ltd.</b>, a Utah limited partnership and commodity pool. The initial
   complaint alleged that, among other things, Brockbank and Love had issued false
   statements to, and misappropriated the funds of, investors in the <b>Birma, Ltd.</b>
   commodity pool they operated.
  </p>
  <p>
   The amended CFTC complaint alleges, among other things, that newly-added defendant
   Purser fraudulently solicited his law clients and others to invest in the Birma, Ltd.
   pool using misrepresentations and failures to disclose material facts, including
   misrepresentations about his own investment in the pool at a time when he had none,
   and a failure to disclose an arrangement he had with defendant Brockbank to receive
   fees. According to the amended complaint, Purser received more than $50,000 in
   administrative and incentive fees for soliciting investors in the Birma, Ltd. pool and
   also took a $10,000 loan from the pool that he never repaid. The complaint alleges
   that one investor Purser solicited invested $300,000 in the Birma, Ltd. pool.
  </p>
  <p>
   The complaint also charges newly-added defendant Jones with having solicited commodity
   pool investors without being registered as a commodity pool operator, as required by
   law. Jones, according to CFTC&#8217;s complaint, solicited over $600,000 from
   investors for the Birma, Ltd. pool.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>CFTC Details Alleged Fraud Charges Against Salt Lake City Residents Brockbank and
   Love</b>
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to adding Purser and Jones as defendants in the CFTC action, the CFTC
   expanded its allegations of fraud committed by Utah residents Brockbank and Love.
   According to the
  </p>
  <p>
   CFTC&#8217;s amended complaint, Brockbank and Love solicited approximately $2 million
   from investors for alleged investments in the Birma, Ltd. commodity pool. The
   complaint alleges that Brockbank and Love misappropriated the investors&#8217; funds
   by, among other things, taking nearly $500,000 in incentive fees and business expenses
   to which they were not entitled or which the pool&#8217;s investors had not
   authorized. The CFTC also claims that Brockbank and Love issued false account
   statements to investors that either grossly exaggerated the pool&#8217;s profits or
   reported profits when the pool&#8217;s accounts were actually losing money.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>CFTC Seeks Monetary Penalties and Repayment for Investors</b>
  </p>
  <p>
   In its continuing litigation, the CFTC intends to seek a permanent injunction,
   disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, a customer repayment remedy known as restitution,
   and civil monetary penalties.
  </p>
