<H1>NACA Makes Ready</H1>Throughout the spring and into the summer of 1958, as 
the administration bill made its way through Congress, NACA had given its full 
participation and support to the man-in-space planning sessions of ARPA and the 
Air Force. But at the same time the research engineers at Langley and on Wallops 
Island were pushing their own studies. They could see the opportunity to carry 
out a manned [94] satellite project coming their way. By early spring all NACA 
laboratories were urgently engaged in basic studies in such areas as propulsion, 
spacecraft configuration, orbit and recovery, guidance and control, structures 
and materials, instrumentation, and aerodynamic heating. Ames and Langley 
researchers were conducting wind tunnel experiments and rocket launches with 
models of orbital vehicles.<A

<P>At the Langley laboratory, proponents and would-be managers of a manned space 
flight program studied the nonlifting approach to orbital circumnavigation, 
refined this concept, tested it, restudied it, and invented new ways to prove 
hardware feasibility and reliability. Floyd L. Thompson, Associate Director of 
Langley and Acting Director most of the time, gave Robert Gilruth the go-ahead 
for manned satellite work. In turn, Gilruth gave a free hand to PARD Chief 
Joseph A. Shortal, Faget, Purser, Charles Mathews, Alan B. Kehlet, Willard S. 
Blanchard, Jr., Carl A. Sandahl, and others at the Virginia laboratory.<A

<P>The search for better experimental methods in manned satellite research 
produced a concept by Purser and Faget for a new test rocket which would employ 
a cluster of four solid-propellant Sergeant rockets to provide a high initial 
thrust. Fired almost vertically and unguided except for large stabilizing 
aerodynamic fins, the rocket would be an inexpensive means of testing full-scale 
models of spacecraft in the most critical phases of an orbital mission - launch, 
abort, and escape at different speeds and under different stresses, parachute 
deployment, and recovery. Such a vehicle could also "toss" a man in a ballistic 
capsule to an altitude of perhaps 100 miles. Late in February, Purser and Faget 
received a job order and authorization to proceed with design work on the test 
rocket, which at that time they called "High Ride."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-5.htm#source62"><SUP>62</A></SUP>
<P>Another experimental technique devised by the PARD engineers was a full-scale 
"capsule simulator." It was designed to test the practicability of controlling 
the attitude of a ballistic vehicle manually by activating air jets mounted on 
its body, similar to the method that would be used to control the X-15 at the 
peak of its trajectory. In March, Purser and several others in PARD put into 
operation a crude simulator rig featuring a small bed covered by a tent and 
attached to a pendulum. The pendulum permitted an oscillation period of two to 
four seconds, during which the "pilot" attempted to realign the simulator by 
firing the air jets. Throughout the spring Langley test pilot Robert A. 
Champine, Purser, and others took turns riding the simulator. Frequently 
modified and improved, it provided useful data on spacecraft reaction 
controls.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-5.htm#source63"><SUP>63</A></SUP>
<P>Meanwhile Faget and his coworkers were steadily modifying the manned 
ballistic satellite design itself. Almost from the beginning of their design 
studies and tests, late in 1957, they had assumed that a ballistic vehicle 
should enter the atmosphere at an attitude 180 degrees from that of launch, so 
the g forces would be imposed on the front of the body under both acceleration 
and deceleration. The "tail" of the capsule when it went into orbit would become 
its "nose" during reentry. Their original capsule configuration - a squat, domed 
body with a nearly [95] flat heatshield - resembled the Mark II missile warhead. 
The body was recessed slightly from the perimeter of the heatshield, leaving a 
narrow lip that theoretically would deflect the airflow in such a way as to 
minimize heat transfer to the after portion. But models of this configuration 
tested in the Langley free-spinning tunnel proved dynamically unstable at 
subsonic speeds. The Faget group then lengthened the capsule fuselage and 
eliminated the heatshield lip. By March 1958, the Langley ballistic vehicle, as 
described by Faget, Garland, and Buglia at the Ames Conference on High-Speed 
Aerodynamics, was an elongated cone. This design contrasted sharply with the 
configuration sketched earlier that month at the ARDC working conference in Los 
Angeles - a rather deep dome, the rounded front end of which was the 
heatshield.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-5.htm#source64"><SUP>64</A></SUP>
<P>The elongated cone provided dynamic stability during the blazing period of 
reentry, but tests in the 11-inch hypersonic tunnel and other tunnels at Langley 
showed that too much heat would be transferred by turbulent convection to its 
afterbody. Besides thermodynamic considerations, the NACA planners could not 
figure out how to fit into the top part of the cone the two parachutes necessary 
for its recovery. The Virginia designers next tried a conical nose shape, then a 
rounded one with a short cylinder attached to it, but the problems of heat 
transfer from the heatshield and insufficient space for parachute packaging 
remained for both of these configurations. It was late summer 1958 before the 
Langley-PARD researchers had settled on a capsule design combining the 
advantages of maximum stability in a nonlifting body, relatively low afterbody 
heating, and a suitable parachute compartment. This was the shape that became 
the basis of the Mercury spacecraft - a blunt face, a frustum, or truncated 
cone, and a cylinder mounted atop the frustum. The completely flat heatshield 
had been discarded because it trapped too much heat, while a rounded face only 
increased heat transfer. The design ultimately chosen featured a heatshield with 
a diameter of 80 inches, a radius of curvature of 120 inches, and a ratio of 1.5 
between the radius of the curve and the diameter of the shield.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-5.htm#source65"><SUP>65</A></SUP> 
This heatshield design, as worked out by William E. Stoney, Jr., of PARD at 
Langley, and confirmed by Alvin Seiff, Thomas N. Canning, and other members of 
the Vehicle Environment Division at Ames, got rid of a maximum amount of heat 
during reentry.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-5.htm#source66"><SUP>66</A></SUP>
<P>Materials research continued at Langley throughout the spring and summer. In 
their man-in-space development plans, the Air Force experts initially had 
favored an ablation heatshield, but their NACA advisers generally felt that the 
ablation technique was not yet reliable enough for manned reentry. In March, two 
of the most respected engineers in the NACA establishment, Gilruth and Soulé of 
Langley, assisted by Clotaire Wood of Headquarters, had presented to the Air 
Research and Development Command NACA's design concepts for manned orbital 
flight, including use of the heat sink on a blunt body as the best thermal 
protection procedure. The question remained open, however. In June, the Wright 
Air Development Center, the Ballistic Missile Division, and NACA agreed to 
undertake joint investigation of heatshield materials, the objective being [96] 
to compile a sufficient quantity of data for ARDC to make a decision between 
heat sink and ablation methods within three months.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-5.htm#source67"><SUP>67</A></SUP>
<P>Considering the unreliability common in early ballistic missiles, and 
especially the widespread lack of confidence in the hard-pushed Atlas, some fast 
and almost foolproof means of escape would be essential to any launch system for 
manned space flight. The Air Force man-in-space designs had included an escape 
mechanism with many moving parts and a degree of complexity unacceptable to the 
NACA engineers. The Air Force plans envisioned a pusher rocket escape system, 
meaning that a rocket or rockets would fire at the base of the capsule to hurl 
it clear of the booster. The PARD rocket experts, again led by Faget, rejected 
this approach and began working on a solid-fueled tractor escape rocket. This 
would be mounted above the capsule and would pull it upward and away from a 
faulty launch vehicle. By the end of August 1958, Willard Blanchard and Sherwood 
Hoffman of PARD, working on plans and suggestions hurriedly made by Faget and 
Andre J. Meyer, Jr., had drawn designs for the escape rocket and tower, 
consisting of a slender rocket case and nozzle and three thin struts fastened to 
the cylinder of the capsule. The Wallops Island engineers already were planning 
a series of test firings of the awkward-looking escape mechanism, using 
"boilerplate" capsules, or full-scale metal models.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-5.htm#source68"><SUP>68</A></SUP>
<P>The solid-fueled tractor rocket with a minimum of components reflected the 
Langley-PARD preoccupation with the easiest, most dependable way to get a manned 
spacecraft into orbit. There were certain interlocking aspects of the approach. 
The "bare" Atlas, the regular ICBM without an upper stage, should be the 
booster. With the ballistic capsule, acceleration forces during launch would be 
about 5 or 6 g; on a shallow reentry trajectory, deceleration loads should not 
exceed 8 or 9 g. But an abort and reentry after a launch following the steep 
trajectory and unbroken acceleration of a single-stage booster could impose as 
much as 20 times the force of gravity on the capsule passenger. Air Force 
planners had considered a two-stage booster and a flight profile with a more 
shallow trajectory, or a variable-drag device like the Avco metal parachute, to 
lessen the abort-reentry g loads - although by midsummer cost considerations 
were pushing the Air Force toward the bare Atlas.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-5.htm#source69"><SUP>69</A></SUP> 
For body support, the Air Force had thought in terms of some kind of rotational 
apparatus to maintain continuously optimum positioning in relation to the 
direction of acceleration.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-5.htm#source70"><SUP>70</A></SUP> 
This procedure, the NACA engineers felt, was too complicated and probably 
entailed too much weight.
<P>As Man-in-Space-Soonest was taking shape in late spring, featuring a 
two–stage booster and either a rotatable interior cabin or a rotatable couch, 
Faget had another idea. Why not build a lightweight, stationary couch that a man 
would lie not on but in? This was the fundamental principle behind the contour 
couch designed by Faget, fabricated out of fiber glass at Langley, and tested on 
the big Navy centrifuge at Johnsville late in July.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-5.htm#source71"><SUP>7l</A></SUP> 
There, in what Faget called "the only technical 'break-through' of the summer," 
Carter C. Collins and R. Flanagan Gray [97] of the Navy endured more than 20 g 
while riding in the contour couch. Then, said Faget, "we were able to disregard 
the USAF 'ground rule' (and a rather firmly established one in their minds) that 
12 g was the reentry design limit." The bare Atlas could be used to hurl a man 
into orbit, and an abort need not impair his safety.<A
