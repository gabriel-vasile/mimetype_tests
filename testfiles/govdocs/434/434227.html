<H1>Wires Get Crossed: Mercury-Scout I</H1>Despite the flurry of activity at 
Hampton, Virginia, Houston, and elsewhere, generated by the impending move, STG 
did not pause in its scheduled Mercury flight test program. Plans had been in 
progress for several months and by the summer of 1961 were well developed for 
Mercury-Scout, whose flight was to provide a dynamic checkout of the Mercury 
tracking network.
<P>Early in May, Purser and Williams of STG, Charles J. Donlan, who had returned 
to the Langley Research Center rolls in April, and Warren J. North of NASA 
Headquarters had met to discuss how the Mercury tracking network, completed at 
the end of March, could be exercised and evaluated. They agreed that the 
four-stage, solid-propellant Scout, originally designed at Langley and popularly 
called the "poor man's rocket," could perform this task economically. North 
briefed Abe Silverstein, NASA Director of Space Flight Programs, when he 
returned to Washington from Langley. In the meantime, William E. Stoney of STG 
had inquired of the Air Force, which also used the Scout, about the [393] 
availability of a Scout launch vehicle. The planners proposed to use the Air 
Force and its contractors for payload design and construction and for vehicle 
assembly and launch. On May 11, Air Force officials replied that a Scout was 
available, but concurrently North reported that Silverstein was not interested 
in a Scout shot. Purser, relaying this information on to Gilruth, remarked that 
"you or Williams will have to talk to him [Silverstein] about it." Mercury-Scout 
mission planning, meanwhile, was already in progress, and Marion R. Franklin of 
STG was temporarily appointed as project engineer. This responsibility took on 
the aspects of a revolving door, with the assignment being shuffled among 
several Task Group engineers. James T. Rose was named to head the project a few 
days later; then Rose and Lewis R. Fisher had co-responsibility, until Rose was 
relieved to continue his work with James A. Chamberlin on what became the Gemini 
two-man spacecraft project proposals.<A

<P>Although Silverstein at Headquarters opposed such a test, those on the 
operations end of Mercury felt that a flight to train the operators and check 
the tracking stations was a necessity. On May 15, 1961, personnel of NASA 
Headquarters and several of its cognizant centers, including Harry J. Goett of 
Goddard, Williams and Purser of Space Task Group, Low from NASA Headquarters, 
and Thomas A. Harris, G. Barry Graves, and Paul Vavra from Langley, met to 
review the proposed Scout launch in view of Silverstein's reluctance. They still 
concluded that the Scout was the best booster for network checkout purposes. The 
problem was how to sell the idea to Silverstein.
<P>Low and Graves saw Silverstein the next day. They told him that only a 
one-orbit flight, possibly carrying a chimpanzee, was scheduled for the next six 
months; moreover, the Air Force had a spare research and development Blue Scout 
booster. This readiness gave promise of a reasonably early launch date, which 
was necessary if the communications exercise were to be worthwhile. Silverstein 
tentatively acquiesced, but he demanded assurance that all the design problems, 
including payload and antennas, would be resolved before he gave final 
Headquarters approval. After that approval, he added, all effort should be made 
to meet an August 15, 1961, firing date.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch12-4.htm#source26"><SUP>26</A></SUP> 
This stipulation apparently was made so that the flight would precede the 
scheduled August 22 launch date of the MA-4 one-orbit flight.
<P>With Silverstein's reluctant blessing, the planners wasted no time in getting 
the Scout enterprise rolling. At a meeting at Langley on May 17, attended by 
Williams, Purser, Merritt Preston, Franklin, and Chamberlin of STG; North of 
NASA Headquarters; and Graves, Virgil F. Gardner, and Elmer J. Wolff of Langley, 
responsibilities were assigned and some general requirements were outlined. As 
noted, Rose and Fisher were named project engineers. Rose was in Los Angeles 
discussing boosters for the two-man project at the time. He received a call from 
Chamberlin requesting him to go to Aeronutronic in Newport Beach, California, to 
talk about instrumentation for the payload. He was joined there by Earl Patton, 
communications expert from McDonnell Aircraft Corporation. [394] Graves asked 
the Goddard Space Flight Center to supply minitrack equipment and Goddard 
tentatively agreed to do so. The purpose of the minitrack equipment (used in the 
instrumented satellite programs) was to furnish data for comparison with that 
which would be transmitted by Mercury instrumentation. Mercury instrumentation 
was to include C- and S-band beacons, telemetry carriers, and either a command 
channel on the minitrack or a receiver operated by a command transmitter. Graves 
also planned to arrange with Goddard for minitrack drawings, and Chamberlin 
volunteered to contact McDonnell for the Mercury instrumentation drawings and 
hardware components. Some thought was briefly given to the possibility of using 
the Langley Research Center to instrument the payload; otherwise the Ford Motor 
Company's Aeronutronic Division, Air Force contractor for the Scout, probably 
would provide the instrumentation.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch12-4.htm#source27"><SUP>27</A></SUP>
<P>On May 23, North in Washington telephoned Purser at Langley and reported that 
Silverstein "had bought the Scout." There was a qualification, however: planning 
could proceed, but money was not to be committed until Robert C. Seamans, Jr., 
NASA's "general manager," approved. Silverstein immediately sought Seamans' 
concurrence, offering the inducement that only the payload would require NASA 
funding ($130,000); the Air Force, using the operation to provide experience for 
its launch crews, would bear the cost of the launch vehicle and launch. 
Silverstein argued to Seamans that delays in the Mercury-Atlas program, with a 
reduction of the flights to be conducted before a manned orbital mission, made 
using the Scout to check out the network seem sensible. The proposed payload, he 
said, would be prepared by Ford Aeronutronic, using components from Mercury 
capsule No. 14, which had already flown in the Little Joe 5-B test of April 28, 
1961. The STG planners estimated that the earliest possible launch date was 
sometime in July, but Silverstein told Seamans that an August date seemed more 
realistic. Seamans agreed and returned the formal STG request on May 26, stamped 
"approved."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch12-4.htm#source28"><SUP>28</A></SUP>
<P>Now that the blessing was official, the Space Task Group made a sustained 
effort to launch in July. In June STG engineers considered the components that 
were to make up the 150-pound payload. Since Associate Administrator Seamans at 
NASA Headquarters had suggested in his approval document that a backup launch 
vehicle be obtained, STG secured the Air Force SSD's commitment to supply a 
second four-stage Scout. Seamans' suggestion proved to be prophetic; although no 
second Mercury-Scout mission was ever launched, the backup fourth stage had to 
be used in the first attempt.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch12-4.htm#source29"><SUP>29</A></SUP>
<P>By early July, the trajectory data and mission directive for Mercury-Scout 
were completed. MS-1 would be launched at the Cape from complex No. 18-B, 
formerly the Project Vanguard launching site, on a true azimuth heading of 72.2 
degrees east of north, aiming at an apogee of about 400 miles and a perigee of 
about 232 miles. Orbital insertion of the payload was to occur some 1,100 miles 
from the Cape, at a speed of 25,458 feet per second and an altitude of 232 
miles. [395] A small rectangular box held the payload, which consisted of a C- 
and S-band beacon, two minitrack beacons, two command receivers, and two 
telemetry transmitters, all with antennas; a 1500 watt-hour battery; and the 
fourth-stage instrumentation package. The payload equipment was to function for 
18 1/2 hours in orbit. To conserve electrical power while in flight, the 
equipment would be turned off by a ground command after the first three orbits. 
During shutdown, the results would be analyzed, and the equipment would then be 
activated to make another three-orbit data collection. The planners felt that by 
repeating the shutdown and reactivation operation they could obtain data 
equivalent to three full missions, gather a wealth of information for 
comparison, and give the DOD and NASA trackers a good workout.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch12-4.htm#source30"><SUP>30</A></SUP>
<P>The launch vehicle for the mission was a 70-foot, solid-propellant Scout 
rocket weighing 36,863 pounds at liftoff. The booster had four stages. Starting 
from the bottom, these included an Aerojet Algol engine with a steel case and 
steel nozzle, burning polyurethane fuel and guided by hydraulic exhaust vanes; a 
Thiokol Castor motor, also with steel case and nozzle, burning a 
polybutadiene-acrylic acid propellant, with a precision autopilot employing 
hydrogen peroxide reaction motors; an Allegheny Ballistic Laboratories Antares 
motor encased in filament-wound fiber impregnated with epoxy resin, propelled by 
nitrocellulose nitroglycerin, and guided by an autopilot identical to that in 
the Castor; and an Allegheny Altair engine of the same construction as stage 3, 
using the same propellant, but with a spin-stabilizing control mechanism.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch12-4.htm#source31"><SUP>31</A></SUP>
<P>The Scout was erected on the pad on July 25 to await mating with the payload. 
Ford Aeronutronic had completed what turned out to be the initial packaging and 
had shipped the payload to the Capeon July 3. There the equipment underwent 
spin-ballast and operational checks and was mated with the booster. But trouble 
with faulty solid-state telemetry transmitters, developing during the pad 
checkout, caused such a delay that a July launching became impossible. At about 
that same time NASA Headquarters decided that the payload had not had sufficient 
vibration testing, so it was shipped to Aeronutronic at Newport Beach, 
California, for testing and repackaging. After it returned to the Cape, 
malfunctions appeared in the Scout's fourth stage, and the Cape engineers had to 
lift the fourth stage from the backup vehicle. The question in August was which 
would be ready first, the launch vehicle or the payload. Then on September 13, 
MA—4, carrying its mechanical astronaut, essentially preempted the Mercury-Scout 
by its orbital trek around Earth. The Scout payload reached the Cape on 
September 20, but all four Scout stages did not return to the pad until October 
22. The anticlimactic Scout launch was supposed to take place on the 31st.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch12-4.htm#source32"><SUP>32</A></SUP>
<P>On Halloween, 1961, a launch crew under the technical supervision of the Air 
Force launch director (who, in turn, was responsible to the NASA operations 
director) attempted the Mercury-Scout launch. The countdown proceeded well down 
to the moment of ignition - when nothing whatever happened. [397] The ignition 
circuits were rechecked and repaired and the next day, November 1, 1961, 
Mercury-Scout took off. Immediately after liftoff, the vehicle developed erratic 
motions, and after 28 seconds the booster began tearing apart. The range safety 
officer gave the destruct signal 43 seconds after launch. The failure, it was 
later determined, resulted simply from a personal error by a technician who had 
transposed the connectors between the pitch and yaw rate gyros, so that yaw rate 
error signals were transmitted to pitch control, and vice versa.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch12-4.htm#source33"><SUP>33</A></SUP> 
Six months of plans and labors had disintegrated in less than a minute.
<P>Ambitions for a second Mercury-Scout, such as had been advocated earlier by 
Seamans, collided with the reality that another Scout rocket would not be ready 
before a Mercury-Atlas launch afforded a satisfactory and complete 
ground-tracking network checkout. The first stage of the backup Scout rocket 
failed its inspection tests, while the fourth stage had been used on the 
ill-fated Mercury-Scout 1 mission. Besides, Mercury-Atlas 5 was scheduled to go 
in mid-November, and the first manned orbital mission was set for December 19. 
Consequently, Low recommended the cancellation of the Mercury-Scout program to 
D. Brainerd Holmes, who had taken on manned space flight duties in NASA 
Headquarters.<A

So the Scout had a short but chaotic life as a member of the Mercury family of 
launch vehicles.

lost in an Air Force Atlas launching mishap. Thirty-five seconds after the 
rocket roared skyward, an explosion destroyed the tiny occupant of a small

upcoming Mercury-Atlas chimpanzee launch, felt that this was a bad augury. But 
the Air Force Atlas had been an advanced E model, with modifications whose 
reliability was unproved, while the D model used in Project Mercury had been 
through its reliability program. So, Goliath notwithstanding, there was no 
change of plans. <I>Baytown</I> (Texas) <I>Sun</I>, Nov. 10, 1961; <I>Houston
