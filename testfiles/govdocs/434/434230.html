14 CFR Part 39

[Docket No. FAA-2005-20026; Directorate Identifier 2004-NM-150-AD]
RIN 2120-AA64

 
Airworthiness Directives; Boeing Model 767-400ER, 777-200, and 
777-300 Series Airplanes

AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.

ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) 
for certain Boeing Model 767-400ER, 777-200, and 777-300 series 
airplanes. This proposed AD would require replacing, with new parts, 
the existing tie-down fitting studs that secure galleys, purser work 
stations, and closets to the seat tracks. This proposed AD is prompted 
by a report that tie-down fitting studs were found damaged. We are 
proposing this AD to prevent a galley, purser work station, or closet 
from detaching from the tie-down fitting studs during an emergency 
landing, which could injure passengers or crewmembers, or obstruct 
escape routes and impede emergency evacuation.

DATES: We must receive comments on this proposed AD by February 28, 
2005.

Discussion

    We have received a report indicating that tie-down fitting studs, 
which secure galleys, purser work stations, and closets to the seat 
tracks, have been found cracked or deformed on a Boeing 777-200 series 
airplane during production. Investigation revealed that the original 
torque values were too high, which damaged the fitting studs during 
installation. This condition, if not corrected, could result in a 
galley, purser work station, or closet detaching from the tie-down 
fitting studs during an emergency landing, which could injure 
passengers or crewmembers, or obstruct escape routes and impede 
emergency evacuation.
    The subject tie-down fitting studs were also installed on Boeing 
Model 767-400ER and 777-300 series airplanes using the same original 
torque values used on Model 777-200 series airplanes. Therefore, all of 
these models may be subject to the same unsafe condition.

Relevant Service Information

    We have reviewed Boeing Service Bulletins 767-25-0338, dated 
October 9, 2003; and 777-25-0217, dated July 17, 2003. Those service 
bulletins describe procedures for replacing, with new parts, the 
existing tie-down fitting studs that secure galleys, purser work 
stations, and floor-mounted closets to the seat tracks. Accomplishing 
the actions specified in the service information is intended to 
adequately address the unsafe condition.

FAA's Determination and Requirements of the Proposed AD

    We have evaluated all pertinent information and identified an 
unsafe condition that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes 
of this same type design. Therefore, we are proposing this AD, which 
would require accomplishing the actions specified in the service 
information described previously, except as discussed under 
``Differences Between the Proposed AD and Service Information.''

Differences Between the Proposed AD and Service Information

    The compliance time for the actions that would be required by the 
proposed AD differs from the compliance times recommended in the 
service information. Boeing Service Bulletin 767-25-0338 recommends 
doing the actions ``at the next maintenance period when manpower and 
facilities are available.'' Boeing Service Bulletin 777-25-0217 
recommends doing the actions at the ``next convenient maintenance 
opportunity, not to exceed 7 years from the initial release'' of the 
service bulletin. In developing an appropriate compliance time for this 
AD, we considered the manufacturer's recommendation, the degree of 
urgency associated with the subject unsafe condition, and the time 
necessary to perform the proposed actions. In light of all of these 
factors, we find that a 60-month compliance time represents an 
appropriate interval of time for affected airplanes to continue to 
operate without compromising safety. We have coordinated this 
difference with Boeing, and they concur with our proposed compliance 
time.

Costs of Compliance

    There are about 349 airplanes of the affected design in the 
worldwide fleet, including about 118 U.S.-registered airplanes. The 
following table provides the estimated costs for U.S. operators to 
comply with this proposed AD, at an average labor rate of $65 per hour.

Authority for this Rulemaking

    Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to 
issue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, Section 106, describes the 
authority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII, Aviation Programs, 
describes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.
    We are issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in 
Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701, ``General 
requirements.'' Under that section, Congress charges the FAA with 
promoting safe flight of civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing 
regulations for practices, methods, and procedures the Administrator 
finds necessary for safety in air commerce. This regulation is within 
the scope of that authority because it addresses an unsafe condition 
that is likely to exist or develop on products identified in this 
rulemaking action.

Regulatory Findings

    We have determined that this proposed AD would not have federalism 
implications under Executive Order 13132. This proposed AD would not 
have a substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship 
between the national Government and the States, or on the distribution 
of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.
    For the reasons discussed above, I certify that the proposed 
regulation:
    1. Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 
12866;
    2. Is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies 
and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and
    3. Will not have a significant economic impact, positive or 
negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria 
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
    We prepared a regulatory evaluation of the estimated costs to 
comply with this proposed AD. See the ADDRESSES section for a location 
to examine the regulatory evaluation.

2002, are considered acceptable for compliance with the 
corresponding action specified in this AD.

Alternative Methods of Compliance (AMOCs)

    (h) The Manager, Seattle Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), 
FAA, has the authority to approve AMOCs for this AD, if requested in 
accordance with the procedures found in 14 CFR 39.19.

    Issued in Renton, Washington, on December 30, 2004.
