  conduit for magma and ash from the interior of the earth unmistakable. The connection 
  be-tween a scarp face and the active fault that sculpted it is less obvious; 
  in fact, the association between earthquakes and such ridges was first made 
  only a century ago. Gently rolling or folded terrain is perhaps the least forbidding 
  landscape, evoking slumber rather than danger. In Matthew Arnold's words:</p>
<p align="center"><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To a boon southern

<p align="left">But Italy's northern Apennine moun-tains - one of the many fold 
  belts that girdle the globe - are not still. Rather these mountains are built 
  by earthquakes along faults hidden well under the landscape. Such earthquakes, 
  which unlike their more familiar coun-terparts do not rupture the earth's surface, 
  we term &quot;surface-folding&quot; earthquakes, or &quot;fold&quot; earthquakes 
  for short. They have only recently become the object of study by investigators.</p>
<p align="left"> The fundamental premise of earthquake-hazard reduction in the 
  U.S. is that most earthquakes take place along active faults that suddenly fail 
  and slip. Large earthquakes take place along large faults, and large faults, 
  it is widely held, cut the earth's surface. Geologists recognize faults that 
  have displaced young surface deposits as having recently been active and deem 
  them the most likely to rupture again.</p><p>
  This reasoning has yielded profound insights into earthquake behavior, making 
  it possible to situate critical facilities-such as power plants and dams-away 
  from active fault sites, to identify sites with high seismic potential and to 
  make probabilistic forecasts of earthquake size and frequency [see &quot;Predicting 
  the Next Great Earthquake in California,&quot; by Robert L. Wesson and Robert 
  E. Wallace; SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, February, 1985].</p><p>
  Yet in California most small earthquakes do not occur along faults that cut 
  the earth's surface. Only 50 years ago this fact was ascribed to an inadequate 
  number of seismometers. Now, however, 700 seismometers are in operation in California, 
  and coverage is more complete than in any other area of the world with the possible 
  exception of Japan. Certainly many micro-earthquakes take place along active 
  faults, such as parts of the San Andreas. But a greater number do not correspond 
  to any known surface fault.</p>
<p> Many of the earthquakes that are not associated with surface faults occur 
  under folds - geologic structures formed when layered sediments are buckled 
  upward in abroad arch called an anticline. The presence of an anticline reflects 
  crustal compression as two moving tectonic plates collide, in much the same 
  way a carpet wrinkles when pushed across the floor. That so many small earthquakes 
  nucleate on faults hidden under folds is remark able and unexpected. The more 
  important question, though, is whether such active folds conceal large faults, 
  which in turn could provide the sites for large shocks.

<p><font size="+3">B</font>y virtue of hindsight it appears that during the past 
  half century large fold earthquakes have taken place in Japan, Argentina, New 
  Zealand, Iran and Pakistan, giving an apparent affirmative answer to the question. 
  The evidence for these events, however, is sparse and subject to interpretation. 
  Yet since 1980 four major events have unequivocally established the reality 
  of fold earthquakes. A fifth event may soon be added to the list.</p>
<p> The first of these shocks took place in 1980 in El Asnam, Algeria. It measured 
  7.3 on the moment-magnitude scale (a successor to the Richter scale, designated 
  M), killed 3,500 people in three North African cities and dammed a major river. 
  The second and third earthquakes, the 1983 M = 6.5 Coalinga shock and the adjacent 
  1985 M = 6.1 Kettleman Hills event, shook areas of California. Because these 
  sites are remote, the earthquakes caused only modest damage and one death, but 
  the areas did include several major toxic-waste storage sites, and in the small 
  town of Coalinga, 75 percent of the unreinforced buildings were demolished. 
  The next shock struck within California's populous Los Angeles basin on October 
  1,1987. Although this M = 6.0 Whittier Narrows quake was only one tenth the 
  size of the Coalinga event, it caused 10 times the damage-$350 million - and 
  took eight lives. The fifth, candidate event was the tragic 1988 Armenian earthquake, 
  which claimed at least 25,000 lives.</p>
<p>
  The most obvious feature of the three California earthquakes was that none of 
  the faults that slipped cut the surface of the earth. In the Algerian event 
  the fault did cut the earth's surface, but the amount of fault slip at ground 
  level was far less than the amount of slip at the depth of the earthquake's 
  focus, about 10 kilometers down. These observations suggest that in fold earthquakes 
  the slip diminishes from earthquake level toward ground level, and so there 
  is little, if any, rupture of the surface</p>
<p> A second feature was that all four earthquakes took place under young anticlines 
  - anticlines that are less than several million years old. Taken with the third 
  and most revealing observation - that at each site the fold rose perceptibly 
  during the earthquake - this suggests not only that young anticlines mark potential 
  earthquake sites but that folds are actually the geologic product of successive 
  earthquakes. If the pattern of diminishing fault slip toward the surface holds 
  in general, then folds should enable us to divine the history of the hidden, 
  or &quot;blind,&quot; faults below.</p>

<p><font size="+3">U</font>nsurpassed data from seismology, geology and geodesy 
  - the measurement of the shape of the earth's surface - make the Coalinga event 
  the most vivid illustration of a fold-related earthquake. Anticline Ridge, a 
  750-meter-high fold (appropriately named by the petroleum geologists who discovered 
  oil there in 1898), grew 75 centimeters during the earthquake [see illustration 
  above].</p>
<p> The youngest folded sediments are less than two million years old, which indicates 
  that the fold began to form since that time. If a 75-centimeter growth is typical 
  for events at the Coalinga site, then Anticline Ridge could have been built 
  by roughly 1,000 ancestral earthquakes of magnitudes from M = 6 to M = 7 recurring 
  every 1,000 to 2,000 years.</p><p>
  The Coalinga event also differed from surface-fault earthquakes in the pattern 
  of its aftershocks. Typically the aftershocks of surface-fault earthquakes are 
  aligned along the plane of the fault itself. On the other hand, the aftershocks 
  at Coalinga - and of fold earthquakes in general - are distributed much more 
  diffusely, both above and below the fault plane. What does this tell us?</p><p>
</p>
<p>Carl M. Wentworth, Jr., of the U.S. Geological Survey and Mark D. Zoback of 
  Stanford University have investigated the deep geologic structure at Coalinga 
  with the help of data from oil-well drill holes, seismic-refraction profiling 
  (based on the travel time of sound waves excited by a controlled explosion as 
  they traverse the structure) and seismic-reflection profiling (based on the 
  timing of sound waves that are generated by orchestrated thumping of the ground 
  and reflected off buried strata). Their results suggest that the core of the 
  Coalinga an-ticline is riddled with faults, many of which exhibit displacements 
  that make up a small fraction of the displacement along the major fault lying 
  at a greater depth.</p><p>
  The majority of structures imaged by these techniques are &quot;reverse&quot; 
  faults, steep faults along which the younger strata are pushed over the older 
  beds below, like a carpet pushed up a tilted floor. When reverse faults are 
  less steeply inclined, they take on the name &quot;thrust&quot; faults. The 
  main Coalinga shock appears to have nucleated on one of the major blind thrust 
  faults. Many of the aftershocks, however, appear to be the result of slip on 
  the smaller reverse faults. The pattern stands in strong contrast to that of 
  a surface-fault earthquake, in which the aftershocks generally take place along 
  a single plane (as can be seen along the San Andreas fault in the illustration 
  on pages 48 and 49).</p>
<p> <font size="+3">H</font>ow does one measure the displacement of faults hidden 
  beneath the surface? The location and amount of slip cannot in fact be observed 
  directly, but they can be deduced from surface measurements with the help of 
  a simple elastic model of the earth's crust. One treats the crust as an elastic 
  solid with an embedded cut - similar to a stiff block of rubber that has been 
  sliced with a knife. When the two faces of the cut are slid past each other, 
  the rubber is strained and its surface is deformed. This elastic analysis was 
  first developed to understand angstrom-sized flaws in crystals but has since 
  been extended to study ruptures of faults 1,000 kilometers long.</p><p>
  By such methods we have discovered that the fault displacement at Coalinga, 
  which was about 3.5 meters at the earthquake depth of nine kilometers, diminished 
  upward, giving rise to folding at shallower depths, and disappeared at a depth 
  of about six kilometers. After the earthquake the fault continued to slip: over 
  the next four years the surface fold deformed by another 10 percent, and the 
  axis of uplift shifted several kilometers eastward [see illustration on preceding 
  page]. The simplest explanation for this observation is that the fault tip is 
  propagating upward and eastward into the core of the anticline. The fault migration 
  is due to the fact that the stress imparted by the earthquake is greatest just 
  beyond the tip of the fault. Any visitor to Independence Mall in Philadelphia 
  has observed the phenomenon: curators of the Uberty Bell were compelled to drill 
  a cylindrical hole at the end of its famous crack to distribute the stress evenly 
  and prevent this national treasure from splitting in two.</p><p>
  Given the tendency of fault tips to propagate, one might well wonder why the 
  great majority of thrust faults, such as the one beneath Coalinga's Anticline 
  Ridge, do not extend all the way to the surface. Through analysis of oil-well 
  logs John Suppe of Princeton University has identified active folds in Taiwan 
  that result from slip along deeply buried faults. He has also examined ancient 
  folds, in which the overlying sediments have been exposed, thereby exhuming 
  the faults beneath. The studies reveal that these faults form at depths of 10 
  to 20 kilometers and propagate slowly toward the surface over millions of years. 
  Consequently many faults are undoubtedly still propagating to the surface and 
  have not yet signaled their presence. Other, inactive faults will remain invisible 
  until they are exposed by erosion of the overlying rocks. This pattern contrasts 
  with that of the more familiar faults, where &quot;what you see is what you 
  get&quot;; such faults either propagate to the surface rapidly or propagate 
  downward.</p><p>
  By modeling the fault-propagation process, Suppe has also found that as the 
  faults migrate, so do the fault propagation folds, which grow in amplitude and 
  change shape [see illustration on opposite page]. The postearthquake deformation 
  at Coalinga shown on the preceding page supplies a remarkable snapshot of the 
  process envisaged by Suppe: as the fault tip propagated to the right, the fold 
  also migrated in that direction.</p>

<p> <font size="+3">O</font>ne example of a fold-related earthquake would not 
  constitute a class. Yet the Coalinga event was not an isolated case; in fact, 
  it was the second of a trio of related events that took place along the same 
  blind thrust fault, the first being the</p><p>
  October 25, 1982, New Idria earthquake to the north and the third being the 
  August 4, 1985, Kettleman Hills earthquake to the south. The three earthquakes 
  were sudden responses to northeast-southwest compression along what is evidently 
  one regional thrust fault approximately l00 kilometers long. The fact that the 
  earthquakes proceeded from north to south suggests that a slip on one patch 
  loads an adjacent patch to the south, which ruptures next. Although the south 
  half of this string of anticlines has not produced a large historical earthquake, 
  it must be viewed as a candidate for a future shock. Repeated earthquakes along 
  the blind fault must have taken place to build this long chain of folds.</p><p>
  Stronger evidence for this point of view comes from the 1980 M= 7.3 El Asnam 
  earthquake in Algeria. The earthquake was produced by a three to six-meter slip 
  on a reverse fault several kilometers underground. Only in the central segment 
  of the fault did much of the slip (two meters) reach the surface. Geoffrey c. 
  P. King, now of the U.S. Geological Survey, Claudio Vita-Finzi of University 
  College, London, and J. C. Ruegg and his colleagues at the Institute of Physics 
  of the Globe in Paris showed that an anticline associated with the fault was 
  uplifted five meters during the earthquake and that the adjacent valley buckled 
  downward one meter [see top illustration on next page]. As a result the Cheliff 
  River, which flowed through a gorge it had hewn through the growing anticline, 
  was dammed. Within days after the earthquake the Cheliff River swelled into 
  a lake.</p><p>
  Before the river cut through the fold 40 centimeters of silt had accumulated 
  in the lake, leaving a permanent mark in the geologic record. Mustapha Meghraoui 
  of the University of Paris and his colleagues have excavated the underlying 
  deposits and found that over the past 6,000 years there has been a succession 
  of six such short-lived lakes, each marking the onset of sudden flooding. The 
  best explanation is that these lakes were the products of surface-folding earthquakes. 
  The El Asnam site not only furnishes evidence for a single fold earthquake but, 
  more important, contains an archive of fold earthquakes, once again providing 
  evidence that anticlines are built by a series of discrete events.</p><p>
  El Asnam displays further evidence that it has experienced repeated earthquakes. 
  Small, secondary faults on the top of folds can also slip during an earthquake 
  in response to the buckling of the fold. If they do, the slips form an accessible 
  record of past quakes, which can be dated by applying carbon-14 methods to the 
  surrounding sediment. Such dating was carried out by Meghraoui and his colleagues 
  on secondary faults in the El Asnam region, and the results are consistent with 
  the lake-sediment record.</p>
<p>The small but ominous Whittier Narrows event, which took place in 1987 in the 
  Los Angeles metropolitan area, rounds out the recent evidence for fold earthquakes. 
  Like its larger predecessors, this earthquake appears to be the product of a 
  tear in a stack of sediments that are being compressed in a geologic vise between 
  two moving crustal plates. By graphically unfolding the buckled strata in the 
  Los Angeles basin, Thomas L. Davis and Jay Namson of Davis and Namson Geological 
  Consultants in Los Angeles have argued that the basin has been shortening at 
  the rate of about a centimeter per year for the past 2.2 million years, which 
  represents 20 percent of the entire plate motion of the western U.S. concentrated 
  in a zone 50 kilometers wide. In other words, Los Angeles may be losing one-quarter 
  acre each year to active surface folding, which may explain the concentrated 
  and enigmatic seismicity of the basin.</p>
<p> <font size="+3">L</font>ike its predecessors the Whittier Narrows earthquake 
  also lifted its associated anticline, the Santa Monica Mountains fold. And like 
  the New Idria, Coalinga and Kettleman Hills shocks, the Whittier Narrows event 
  seems to mark an extensive blind fault. Evidence from the alignment of small-to-moderate 
  earthquakes (advanced by Egill Hauksson of the University of Southern California 
  and Lucile M. Jones of the U.S. Geological Survey) suggests that the Whittier 
  Narrows event is but one of several earthquakes that have taken place along 
  a blind fault running for 150 kilometers beneath the California coastline. The 
  M = 5.6 earthquake on February 21, 1973, at Point Mugu took place at the western 
  end of the proposed fault and shares many attributes with the larger fold-related 
  earthquakes: it accommodated crustal compression, uplifted the Santa Monica 
  Mountains by 35 millimeters, left a diffuse zone of aftershocks and showed no 
  surface-fault slip.</p><p>
  In the preceding discussion much of the evidence for fold earthquakes may have 
  seemed indirect: projection of surface deformation to greater depths and examination 
  of aftershock distribution. More direct evidence can be obtained only with 
  access to the interior of an anticline, and direct access is possible only 
  when a fold has been extensively plumbed for oil. The Ventura Avenue anticline, 
  which is punctured by more than 1,400 wells drilled to a depth of as much as 
  6.6 kilometers, is among the best studied - and also fastest-rising - folds 
  in the world and so is ideal for close inspection.</p><p>
  The Ventura Avenue anticline, located on the southern California coast, has 
  uplifted former deep-water sediments and exposed these folded layers in cliffs 
  near the coastline. Although no major earthquakes have been registered along 
  the Ventura Avenue anticline, its structure and prehistoric record tell us 
  much that is pertinent to the other earthquake sites we have discussed. </p><p>
  Like many anticlines the Ventura Avenue structure traps oil and gas that migrate 
  into its core. The logs of the oil wells that have been drilled into the Ventura 
  Avenue anticline enable us to view it in cross section [see bottom illustration 
  at left]. The curvature of the strata is broad at the surface but becomes progressively 
  tighter at greater depths. At about four kilometers below ground level, the 
  fold exhibits a sharp kink, underlaid by mechanically weak rock. An exploratory 
  well 6.6 kilometers deep penetrated enough of the weaker rock to demonstrate 
  that the strata below the kink are not folded at all. This evidence suggests 
  that beneath the fold lies a nearly horizontal thrust fault. Smaller, steeply 
  inclined reverse faults extend upward from the base of the anticline to ground 
  level.</p><p>
  The Ventura anticline appears to have been uplifted by slip on the Barnard 
  thrust fault that branches off the Sisar fault at the base of the fold. The 
  slip of the internal reverse faults also seems to result from motion along the 
  Barnard fault. Farther to the north, slip on the Barnard fault exceeds that 
  on the Sisar fault, causing the strata to be jammed together and bowed upward. 
  This close inspection of the Ventura anticline shows that it not only hides 
  a major thrust fault at the depth of the greatest slip but also harbors myriad 
  smaller reverse faults within its core. These structural features are remarkably 
  similar to those inferred from seismic imaging and geodetic measurements at 
  the Coalinga and Kettleman Hills folds.</p>

        the core of the Ventura Avenue anticline. Such fracturing, caused by bending

        oil wells (vertical green lines) drilled into the anticline shows that 
        the fold flattens at a depth of about six kilometers. This is best explained 
        by the presence of a nearly horizontal fault, or thrust fault, at the 
        fold's base. Movement along faults that diverge from this main fault causes 
        the fold to buckle and grow as does the model on the preceding page. The

<p><font size="+3">T</font>he internal structure of the Ventura Avenue anticline 
  helps to explain several shared features of the Coalinga, Kettleman Hills, Whittier 
  Narrows and El Asnam earthquakes: although the greatest slip takes place on 
  the major fault at the fold base, slip on the abundant small reverse faults 
  scattered throughout the core may well account for the diffuse distribution 
  of aftershocks that characterizes fold earthquakes.</p>
<p>
  Another observation from Ventura Avenue helps to explain a second distinguishing 
  feature of most fold events, which we have not yet mentioned: the faults ruptured 
  slowly. Although not all fold-related earthquakes are slow, almost all slow 
  earthquakes are fold-related. Goran Ekstrom of Columbia University has shown 
  that the Kettleman Hills rupture took about four times longer (16 seconds) than 
  is typical for a surface-faulting earthquake of the same size. John L. Nabelek 
  of Oregon State University found that at the northern segment of the El Asnam 
  site, where the aftershocks were most dispersed and negligible reverse faulting 
  cut the surface, the seismic rupture took twice the expected time. At Coalinga 
  the seismic rupture time was normal, but the fold continued to grow after the 
  earthquake at an exponentially decaying rate, which was a result of continued 
  slow slip and propagation of the blind thrust fault.</p><p>
  The slow rupture time may be explained by the high fluid pressures registered 
  in boreholes at the Ventura Avenue, New Idria, Coalinga and Kettleman Hills 
  sites. Robert F. Yerkes of the U.S. Geological Survey has shown that the fluid 
  pressure there exceeds hydrostatic pressure below three kilometers. The folds 
  seal in the fluids, whereas surface faults provide a source of leakage. High 
  fluid pressure in the rock fractures reduces the frictional resistance of the 
  rock to sliding, thereby enhancing its susceptibility to both faulting and folding. 
  Diffusion of the pore fluid after the rupture alters the friction along faults, 
  inhibiting slip on some fractures and promoting it on others. The result is 
  a spread of rupture times that can manifest itself as a slow, or prolonged, 
  earthquake.</p>
<p> <font size="+3">W</font>e claim that folds are built - at least in part - 
  in a punctuated fashion by successive earthquakes over hundreds of thousands 
  or millions of years, rather than by slow, steady deformation. The Ventura Avenue 
  anticline also provides persuasive evidence for this point of view.</p>
<p> The anticline is only 200,000 to 300,000 years old; during that period it 
  has been growing at one of the fastest rates in the world. Kenneth R. Lajoie 
  and Andrei M. Sarna-Wojcicki of the U.S. Geological Survey have identified nine 
  marine platforms on the flank of the anticline, the youngest one lifted two 
  meters above sea level, the oldest raised 20 meters. Each of these terraces 
  was cut by storm waves at or near sea level and strewn with seashells. Carbon 
  dating of the shells yields ages of 1,800 years for the youngest terrace and 
  5,600 years for the oldest. Because sea level is known from independent evidence 
  to have been within a meter of its current height during the past 7,000 years, 
  the terraces could not have been cut during periods when sea level was higher 
  than it is now; rather the land has been rising. The preservation of nine separate 
  platforms suggests that this uplift was not gradual but sudden. As in the case 
  of the El Asnam lakes, the simplest explanation for this giant flight of stairs 
  is uplift produced by repeated earthquakes.</p>

<p>We have argued that the El Asnam, Coalinga, Kettleman Hills and Whittier Narrows 
  earthquakes provide indisputable evidence that folds grow during large earthquakes. 
  Moreover, the prehistoric record at El Asnam and Ventura Avenue also illustrates 
  that such events have recurred. Yet most earth scientists have viewed folds 
  as evidence for steady, progressive deformation that need not be punctuated 
  by earthquakes. The difficult question, then, is: Are the cases we have discussed 
  the exception or the rule? In other words, is fold growth dominantly steady 
  and aseismic or do most actively growing folds in fact conceal seismic faults?</p>
<p>
  If one were to ask the same question about motion along active faults that cut 
  the earth's surface, the answer would be that few faults are seen to undergo 
  steady slip, or creep; the rule is that creep is uncommon in the uppermost 15 
  kilometers of the crust. There are of course notable exceptions, the central 
  300 kilometers of the San Andreas fault among them. Worldwide, however, most 
  faults exhibit the stick-and-slip behavior that gives rise to earthquakes.</p><p>
  Nowhere is this question more important than in the Los Angeles basin. The 1.5-kilometer-high 
  Santa Monica Mountains fold (which, at Whittier Narrows, is almost completely 
  buried by sediments shed by the San Gabriel Mountains) is less than 3.3 million 
  years old. The average uplift rate is therefore about 0.5 millimeter per year. 
  During the Whittier Narrows earthquake, however, the fold grew 50 millimeters 
  at the earth's surface. If fold growth is caused entirely by earthquakes, then 
  an earthquake should recur at this site every century. Yet the section of fault 
  that slipped during the 1987 earthquake was about five kilometers long, only 
  about 3 percent of the length of the entire blind fault, which may be as long 
  as 150 kilometers. Consequently, if all parts of the fault are equally likely 
  to slip in an M = 6 earthquake, shocks should strike the Los Angeles basin and 
  the adjacent coastline every three to five years. Clearly this has not happened: 
  an average of just one shock of magnitude greater than or equal to M = 6 has 
  been recorded every 25 years in this corridor since Los Angeles was settled 
  in the early 19th century.</p><p>
  One possible explanation for the discrepancy is that most of the fault slip 
  and fold growth is in fact steady: stress does not accumulate but is continuously 
  relieved by creep. The thrust faults beneath many folds lie at depths of 12 
  to 15 kilometers, where the crust may reach a temperature at which the quartz 
  component of the rock becomes ductile and facilitates creep. If the faults undergo 
  steady slip, then the folds above may also deform progressively. Although there 
  is no direct evidence for steady fold growth, stable sliding has been simulated 
  in rock samples in the laboratory, and as much as half of the slip on the interface 
  between tectonic plates along the plate boundaries around the Pacific Ocean 
  is aseismic.</p><p>
  We think it is more likely that the folds grow intermittently through earthquakes 
  that are larger than the Whittier Narrows event but that are much less frequent. 
  Earthquakes of magnitudes greater than M = 7 recurring every several hundred 
  years could account for the fold growth, and the scenario would be consistent 
  withthe absence of smaller events during the brief recorded history of the Los 
  Angeles basin.</p>
<p> <font size="+3">I</font>t is incumbent on seismologists to distinguish between 
  the two competing explanations; their consequences are dramatically different. 
  If earthquakes larger than the 1987 event are possible beneath the Santa Monica 
  Mountains fold, then Los Angeles's greatest earthquake threat may come not from 
  a future M = 8 shock on the San Andreas fault, 50 kilometers to the north, but 
  from a smaller earthquake originating under downtown Los Angeles.</p><p>
  Several tools are now at our disposal to probe the Los Angeles basin as well 
  as other active fold belts around the world. They include seismic-reflection 
  profiling, geodetic measurement of the present rate of fold contraction and 
  uplift, examination of the logs from thousands of oil wells and geologic investigations 
  to identify the fastest-growing surface folds.</p><p>
  Although southern California has served as a focal point for efforts to study 
  fold-related earthquakes in the U.S., evidence indicates that such events have 
  struck throughout the world's active fold belts and therefore endanger a much 
  larger population [see illustration on page 55]. In addition to North Africa, 
  the site of the El Asnam earthquake, events of magnitudes from M = 7 to M = 
  7.8 have taken place on blind faults in northern India, New Zealand, Argentina, 
  Canada and Japan. Countries such as Chile, Yugoslavia, Taiwan, Iran and Pakistan 
  may also be subject to highly damaging fold events.</p><p>
  The most recent - and among the most tragic - example of a fold earthquake claimed 
  worldwide attention just six months ago. We are of course referring to the December 
  7, 1988, M = 6.8 earthquake in Spitak, Armenia, which killed at least 25,000 
  people. The earthquake struck in one of the world's most intensely folded and 
  seismically active regions, the Lesser Caucasus Mountains of the Soviet Union. 
  The main shock was the result of slip on a reverse fault beneath a youthful 
  anticline. Rupture along a surface fault was found, but it extended for only 
  eight to 12 kilometers, whereas aftershocks were distributed over a 50-kilometer-long 
  zone beneath the fold. This suggests that little of the slip that caused the 
  earthquake reached the earth's surface. As with the other fold earthquakes we 
  have discussed, the aftershock pattern was also diffuse rather than aligned 
  along the fault plane, as it would have been in a surface-fault earthquake. 
  The preliminary evidence therefore indicates that the Spitak event was fold-related.</p>
<p> The size and destructive character of the Armenian earthquake could not have 
  been predicted on the basis of its short surface fault, but the fold provided 
  a clue that seismologists must not, in the future, overlook.</p>
