<br>
FLT ATTENDANT #1 RPTED PAX IN SEAT X HAD TAKEN HER CLOTHES OFF AND SHE AND PAX IN SEAT Y WERE ENGAGED IN SEXUAL ACTIVITY. I APCHED THE PAX AND TOLD THE MAN IN SEAT Y THAT THEIR BEHAVIOR WAS UNACCEPTABLE AND THEY MUST REFRAIN. I RETURNED TO THE BUSINESS CLASS GALLEY AND SEAT Z (LADY) REQUESTED THAT WE PLEASE STOP THE COUPLE FROM THEIR SEXUAL ACTIVITY, AS IT WAS CAUSING HER DISTRESS. I RPTED THE COUPLE TO THE PURSER AND SHE SPOKE TO COUPLE ALSO ABOUT THEIR SEXUAL ACTIVITY. THEY DID NOT STOP AND CONTINUED UNTIL BREAKFAST SVC WAS PRESENTED AND LIGHT WAS EMITTED INTO THE CABIN. PAX SEAT X PUT HER CLOTHES ON JUST PRIOR TO LIGHTING IN CABIN. I OBSERVED PAX SEAT X SITTING IN SEAT IN BRA AND PANTIES. SHE WAS MASTURBATING IN SEAT AND PAX SEAT Y WAS MANIPULATING HER AND PUTTING HIS HANDS IN HER PANTIES AND ON HER EXPOSED BREASTS. THEY WERE KISSING AND WRITHING IN THEIR SEATS. PURSER REPEATEDLY ASKED SEAT X AND Y TO STOP THEIR PERSISTENT SEXUAL ACTIVITY AND THEY WOULD NOT. SHE TOLD THE CREW SECURITY WOULD MEET THE FLT. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: THE RPTR STATED THE COUPLE DIDN'T START THEIR SEXUAL ACTIVITY UNTIL AFTER DESERT WAS SERVED, AND NOT THE WHOLE TRIP, AS IT SAID IN HER ORIGINAL NARRATIVE. THIS WAS ABOUT 4 HRS FROM MANCHESTER, ENGLAND. THE COUPLE WOULD NOT STOP THEIR SEXUAL ACTIVITY AFTER REPEATED REQUESTS FROM THE CREW AND THE PURSER. THE PLTS WOULD NOT COME OUT OF THE COCKPIT FOR FEAR OF BEING SLUGGED. THE WOMAN TOOK ALL HER CLOTHES OFF, EXCEPT FOR HER BRA AND PANTIES. SHE WOULD NOT PUT HER CLOTHES BACK ON, WHEN ORDERED TO BY THE CREW, AND IN FACT, BECAME QUITE LOUD AND PROFANE WHEN ASKED. SHE SLUNG HER LEGS OVER THE SEAT IN FRONT OF HER. SHE WAS PERFORMING FELLATIO ON THE MAN AND MASTURBATING BOTH OF THEM. AT ONE POINT, ONE OF THE COMPLAINING PAX WAS A 65 YR OLD WOMAN ON HER FIRST FLT, WHO ASKED IF THIS WAS A REGULAR OCCURRENCE ON FLTS! THE RPTR STRONGLY FEELS THAT ALCOHOL WAS NOT A FACTOR, BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE THAT MUCH TO DRINK, AND THEY BOTH GOT COMPLETELY DRESSED FOR LNDG, AND SHE HAD REPLENISHED HER MAKEUP AND HAIR. THE MANCHESTER POLICE ARRESTED THE WOMAN FIRST, BECAUSE SHE PUT UP A LOUD AND PROFANE FIGHT. THEY THEN DECIDED TO ARREST THE MAN. THE POLICE HAVE CALLED THE RPTR AT HOME FOR HER STATEMENT AND ARE MEETING HER FLT TO GATWICK AT THE END OF THE MONTH TO TAKE HER STATEMENT IN PERSON. SHE SAYS THEY SEEM ADAMANT IN PURSUING PROSECUTION OF THE COUPLE.
