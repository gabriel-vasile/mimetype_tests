The aircraft had no Mode C displayed but our  Letter of Agreement with the Center requires props on the arrival to be at  11,000 feet and jets at 12,000 feet. When the aircraft checked in, I confirmed  his altitude and informed the pilot his Mode C was not working and asked him if  any other controllers had mentioned this to him. The pilot stated that no one  had informed him and they were trying to recycle the transponder. I instructed  the pilot to descend and maintain 9,000 feet and to report reaching. The pilot  then informed me that he was getting an error message on the TCAS regarding  lack of altitude. I issued the pilot an instruction and when he responded I  heard the 1,000 feet-to-go warning...so I confirmed that he was leaving 10,000  feet for 9,000 feet. He responded yes, and after about 90 seconds I asked the  pilot if he was level at 9,000 feet and he then stated he lost all avionics....<a href="#3"><br>

The purser had asked the passenger if they would mind  moving&nbsp; to the window seat so that the  improvised foot rest wouldn&rsquo;t block the exit path in front of the seat. The  passenger replied that their disability made it impossible for them to sit in  the window seat. At this point, the purser brought the issue to me...I went out  to the gate area to advise our [passenger agents] that we needed to find some  solution to this, because we couldn&rsquo;t have exit space in front of this  passenger&rsquo;s seat blocked, per FAR. The passenger agent...quickly refused to  deal with the problem because 1) this passenger works in a government agency,  and 2) because the passenger is at our company&rsquo;s highest level of Frequent  Flyer program...<a href="#4"><br>

                                      <p class="narrative">....During this entire time I contemplated turning  around but I continued to assume better conditions were close ahead, and was  also concerned that conditions behind me may have worsened. Finally I made a  smart decision, to confess my dilemma to ATC, who suggested calling Flight  Watch. I did contact Flight Watch who were very helpful, suggesting conditions  should be better ahead, to the north, or failing that, at, or to the west of my  destination. Shortly thereafter, I saw a large break in the cloud layer and  descended rapidly through it to 6,500 feet. The remainder of the flight was  completed uneventfully....<br>
                                        <br>
                                        In retrospect, staying below the clouds would have  been a much better option. I allowed incorrect assumptions about the extent of  the overcast layer to influence my judgement, and failed to consider turning  back when it was still my best option. On the positive side, I did eventually  admit my mistake and obtain the assistance I needed, and Flight Watch and ATC  were both helpful in resolving the situation without incident.</p>

The Captain then told the Tower that we were now ready  and we were cleared for takeoff on Runway 7L.</p>
                                      <span class="narrative">This scenario, while simple and with no  violations, created a lot of confusion and chaos in the cabin, in the cockpit,  and with ATC. I would continue to encourage the cabin crew to call us as soon  as possible if they experience cabin security violations to allow us time to  coordinate with ATC. In time-critical situations such as this scenario,  explaining the nature of the problem to ATC and simply moving to the holding  area to regroup may be the better choice in order to give everyone time to  clear their heads in preparation for a safe, focused departure.</span></li>

                                      <p>A Supervisor was called as was a Flight Ops  Supervisor to deal with the problem. We ended up going back down to the  airplane and had 5 people crammed in the cockpit of my B757 (2 pilots, the  purser, and 2 supervisors) discussing what to do...I finally got across to the  [passenger] Supervisor that it was illegal to have the area in front of this  passenger&rsquo;s seat blocked for taxi, takeoff, and landing, and that the  passenger&rsquo;s Frequent Flyer status and position in the government didn&rsquo;t change  that. The Supervisor then went back and asked the passenger if they would mind  if the cushions were stowed during those critical phases of flight, and the  passenger said OK, and that was the end of it, but we took an 18-minute delay  dealing with what should have been a simple problem....</p>
                                    I can&rsquo;t imagine what would have happened if the  passenger had refused to allow the pillows/cushions to be stowed. I wasn&rsquo;t  going to leave the gate like that. I need to point out that when the purser was  originally trying to find a solution on her own with the passenger, the  passenger said that...this was the first time anybody had said anything about  this issue....My airline (and flight attendants) could have been violated every  time an airplane took off and landed with this passenger&rsquo;s cushions in front of  them, but the violation was ignored up to this point....</li>
