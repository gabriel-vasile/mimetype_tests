    vessels of the United States, each of which must have a licensed
    master regardless of the factors listed above. Subsection (b)
    applies to offshore supply vessels. Subsection (c) exempts fishing
    or whaling vessels or yachts from these requirements.
      Subsection (d) permits the Secretary to suspend any part of this
    chapter during a declared national emergency or to increase the
    number of licensed individuals required by this chapter if required
    for safe operation of a vessel.

    Sec. 8302. Staff department

-STATUTE-
      (a) This section applies to a vessel of the United States except -
     
        (1) a fishing or whaling vessel or a yacht;
        (2) a vessel operated only on bays, sounds, inland waters, and
      lakes (except the Great Lakes); and
        (3) a vessel ferrying passengers and cars on the Great Lakes.

      (b) The staff department on a vessel is a separate and
    independent department. It consists of individuals registered under
    section 7101 of this title, clerks, and individuals assigned to the
    senior registered medical doctor.
      (c) The staff department is composed of a medical division and a
    purser's division. The officer in charge of each division is
    responsible only to the master. The senior registered medical
    doctor is in charge of the medical division. The senior registered
    purser is in charge of the purser's division.
      (d) The officer in charge of the purser's division of the staff
    department on an oceangoing passenger vessel licensed to carry more
    than 100 passengers shall be a registered chief purser. When more

    assistant purser and one registered junior assistant purser.
      (e) A person may not employ an individual to serve in, and an
    individual may not serve in, a grade of staff officer on a vessel,
    when that staff officer is required by this section to be
    registered, if the individual does not have a certificate of
    registry as staff officer in that grade. A person (including an
    individual) violating this subsection is liable to the United
    States Government for a civil penalty of $100. However, if a
    registered staff officer is not available at the time of sailing,
    the vessel may sail with an unregistered staff officer or without a
    staff officer.
      (f) A staff officer may not be included in a vessel's certificate
    of inspection.
      (g) A registered staff officer serving under this section who is

    --------------------------------------------------------------------

      Section 8302 sets forth the organization and manning requirements
    of the staff department of a vessel. The staff department has
    medical and clerical responsibilities.
      Subsection (a) applies this section to every United States vessel
    except a yacht, a fishing, whaling, or certain types of inland
    waterway vessel, and a ferry carrying passengers or cars on the
    Great Lakes. A ferry is a vessel that primarily carries passengers,
    cars, or trains from shore to shore as a means to connect existing
    points on a transportation route so that the same type of
    transportation mode may continue to be used upon arrival at either
    point. Vessels carrying cars as cargo would not be included in this
    type of vessel.
      Subsection (b) establishes the staff department as a separate one
    consisting of registered individuals (pursers, medical doctors, and
    professional nurses), clerks, and medical assistants. Subsection
    (c) divides the department into a medical division and a purser's
    division and designates the individual in charge of each division.
    Subsection (d) prescribes particular requirements of the purser's
    division based on size of the vessel or number of individuals
    employed in the division.
      Subsection (e) prohibits the employment or service of an
    individual who is not registered or of the grade as required under
    this section and prescribes a penalty for violation of the
    subsection. This penalty applies to both the employer and the
    individual employed. If a registered staff officer is unavailable
    at the time of departure for a voyage, the vessel may proceed on
    its voyage with either an unregistered staff officer or without a
    staff officer.
      Subsection (f) prohibits including a staff officer on a vessel's
    certificate of inspection.
      Subsections (g) and (h) prescribe the type and restrictions for
    the uniform accouterments of a staff officer.

                                AMENDMENTS                            
      2006 - Subsec. (g). Pub. L. 109-163 substituted "Navy Reserve"
    for "Naval Reserve".
      1985 - Subsec. (b). Pub. L. 99-36 inserted a comma after
    "clerks".
