fired a Gun.  At 2 arrived at the companys dock in 24 days and 6 hours from "Yokohama".  made preparations for leaving the ship.  At 4 having passed my baggage all right.  took Coach for the Cosmopolitan Hotel the following officers acompanying me.  Tayor, Babson, Winchester & Whitman. Also Capt Rouse, all the other officers went to the Oriental. after getting a good hearty dinner smoked a cigar and in the evening visited the "Alhamton theatre" (California Minstrels) where we saw a very good performance.  retired to my virtuous couch at 12 midnight or thereabouts.

Wednesday Feb 24th {1869/02/24}  Weather very fine and pleasant but I find it is the same old California dusty and nasty as of old.  today went to the companys office and procured my ticket through to New York. via Panama RR and Steamship "Ocean Queen".  today have remained in the Hotel and watched the Pedestrians passing by.  find the "Cosmopolitan" a very nice Hotel arosticratic and all that sort of thing but oh, the females dress to kill here and put on more airs than a french dancing master.  I also find to my horror that it costs a few to stop here. but any port in a storm, having seen my name among the passengers and arrivals, some of my acquaintances have called to see me.  I find myself almost a stranger in San Francisco altho some parts of it look natural to me and have not changed much in appearance, all the Gambling houses which were in opperation when but I was here (in 1855) have disappeared and more respectable institutions now occupy their places.  the "whitepine" fever is the present excitement here now.  (silver mines)  but it does not as yet affect prices &c.  as yet. I have not caught the fever. (very effectualy) and do not think I shall untill I have fulfilled my serious intentions of visiting the East and enjoyed the priviledges of seeing my wife and some few others.  this evening visited my friends and associates at the "Occidental". found Mr Kellogg somewhat worse, but not allarmingly dangerous, took a quiet sober drink and at 12 retired clean and sober.

Thursday Feb 25th {1869/02/25}  Weather fine and pleasant.  warm & find no occasion for overcoats here unless it is in the evening and not necessary then only to insure health &c.  it is now the rainy season.  a few days fine and then rain for a week.  took a swing around the city and among the shipping &cc--after getting back to the Hotel was obliged to use soap and water pretty freely to see myself again.  went around to the Occidental to see Mr Kellogg and found him very bad.  under the doctors attendance,  I think it is doubtfull if he remains well enough to accompany us on the next Steamer.  but we shall take him along if it is a possible thing.  the "Constitution" has not yet arrived from Panama and it is thought she will not arrive in time to resume her regular trip on the 27th  I hope so for I am really tired of this and do not care to be unnecessarily detained under the circumstances. in the evening walked down Montgomery Street and viewed the fashions &c retired to my lonely couch at 11.30 --sober--

Friday Feb 26th {1869/02/26}  Pleasant as usual.  No "Constitution" yet.  went to the companys office on ____ Street. and received the information that the "Constitution" would not arrive in time to sail on the 27th and therefore would not sail untill the 1st March (Monday) very unfortunate and inconvenient to us all.  paying board and the greater part of our baggage stored away in the companys storehouse on the dock but maskee, we will get into New York sometime this year I presume.  hurrah!!  the "Constitution" arrived at 9.30 this evening. retired at 10--happy---

Saturday Feb 27th {1869/02/27} Weather as yesterday warm and pleasant.  have amused myself today sitting around and eating my regular whack as usual.  am tired of this sort of fun.  Tomorrow is Sunday again.  but every day is Sunday to me now. do not think that I shall attend Church for various reasons too numerous to mention.  Captain Warsaw visited us today at the Hotel.  all her officers are stopping here but him.  retired again at 11-- tired and sleepy--

Sunday Feb 28th {1869/02/28}  Weather pleasant and fine.  have not been to church today.  remained quiet in the Hotel expecting friends to call but was disappointed.  Mr Winsors time I presume is all taken up with his wife but I hear he is obliged to remain most of the time on board the "China". (night and day.)  I find the California Customs still remain in force.  Sunday is no better than any other day here, all the stores remain open, including drinking saloons, Billiard halls &c.  Some few who are pious observe the day Sacred as they should.  in my opinion "San Francisco" is a very immoral city and is not a model city by no means.  I think however that I should like to live here and make it my home.  I like the people very much and incline to their ways of living and ease,  retired early it being my last night.

Monday March the 1st. {1869/03/01}  Rose early at  7.  packed and lashed my trunk. Eat my breakfast.  payed my Hotel bill. and at 9:30 we all packed into a Hotel coach and started for the Steamship Constitution.  arrived then at 10 and found the usual stir and excitement consequent at a steamship landing.  not only was the steamer packed with every kind of people but the pier also exhibited equal anxiety.  saw my baggage all right.  (Room No 45) in company with Captain Rouse.  100 first class passengers, 70 or 80 2nd class and 60 in steerage.  with the usual quantity of youngones,  went on board the "China" and bid goodbye to all her officers.  Capt Warsaw remaining with us to the last minute.  at 11 precisely the lines were cast off and we gradualy steamed out the harbour, firing a gun as we departed.  at 12 passed the heads and crossed the bar,  fresh breezes from the Srd Wwd moderate swell. Weather partialy clear and passing rain squalls, some few having a tendency to discharge their valuable contents did so without regards to the feelings of their fellow passengers.  amused myself up to 11 oclk playing cards &c and amid the squalls of the small frys succeeded in obtaining a good sound sleep.  the consciousness I suppose of knowing that I was truly on my way home (amid all the transpiring scenes) alone prevented my being disturbed.  truly  circumstances alter cases.  (sometimes).

At 1 PM  "San Miguel" Island 5 miles on Port beam. distant from "San Francisco" 251 miles. weather fine and pleasant. passed several small sail bound Nwd.  I find the "Constitution" does not compare with the "China". not so good in accomodations &c.  still she is a very good ship, fast &cc,  not having the time to keep her in good order, she is consequently out of repair and dirty and nasty.  her servants are not attentive and appear to be all Irishman or niggers, serving under a gentleman of color (the Steward)  who is always willing and ready to do everything you ask, but lacks promptness taking his own time to do it &c.  the meal hours are as follows on the "Constitution", breakfast (2nd class passengers) at 7. all children 7.30, breakfast (1st class passengers) at 8.30,  Dinner.

Captain Wm S Hudson.  1st officer Cobb, 2nd officer Carrol.  3rd officer ____. Purser, Gilman.  Doctor, ____. Freight clerk, Nichols  Chief Engineer Lateron, the Captain appears to be a nice man although he is not considered popular,  he seems to be partial to us Naval officers and does not appear to notice any one else.  minds his own business and lets every one else mind theirs.  in the evening found two of our young lady passengers could play on the Piano so we had a good sing with their assistance.  they are as yet diffident & bashfull but in good time their accomplishments will I presume show forth.

I find that I am not the only Journalist on board  it  is quite amusing to see them all sitting around the Saloon writing their compositions. (Male and Female).  I should like to peruse some of them.  and I should hope they would prove more interesting than this one.  Captain Hudson was also among us and amused us very much in his stories and pleasing address.  retired at 11.30

At 1 PM arrived in the Port of "Manzanillo" and commenced coaling ship. several of the passengers went on shore to see the place. but I prepared to remain quiet on board as it does not appear to have a very inviting look.  any quantity of fruit was brought off to the ship.  but none for me.  at 6.30 pm bid farewell to "Manzanillo". all hands on the hurricane deck singing psalm tunes &c.  (I had almost forgot to mention that divine services were performed at 11 am on board the "Constitution" the Purser officiating.  it ammounted to about the same as it did on the "China".

Good manners are the blossoms of good sense.  and it may be added of good feelings too for if the law of kindness be written in the heart. it will lead to that disinterestedness in little as well as in great things.  that desire to oblidge and attention to the gratification of others.  which is the foundation of good manners.  the happiness of our life is made up of little courtesies,  little kindnesses.  pleasant words. genial smiles,  a friendly letter and good deeds. 

A consideration for the feelings of others and quick perception of what those feelings are under the different circumstances of life constitutes true politeness.  and those who possess it not. whatever be their rank. are Vulgar.
