Notes
-----

1.  The user can select the different wind product types individually (e.g.,
    DDIR will retrieve only data for the infrared cloud-drift winds), or can
    choose to get all wind product types with the same variable call (DD will 
    get data for all available product types).

    The availability of each product type, and the exact algorithms being used
    to create them, are a function of the satellite data provider.  Currently,
    MADIS supports two processing streams:  GOES operational products (3 hour
    availability, all types), and GOES experimental products (1 hour availability,
    no sounder channel products).  The GOES experimental products are only 
    available in the FSL database.

    For more information on GOES wind products, see:

       Daniels, J.M., C. Velden, G.A. Dengel, D.R. Stettner, and W. Bresky, 2003:
       Status and Development of GOES Wind Products at NOAA/NESDIS.  12th Conference
       on Satellite Meteorology, Feb 9-13, 2003.

       This paper is online at:  http://ams.confex.com/ams/pdfview.cgi?username=53647.         

2.  Wind speed and direction are reported and stored in the database.  The user 
    can optionally select u & v wind components and those will be calculated and 
    returned.  The QC results from speed and direction will be used In either 
    case, and if one of the map projections has been selected via the MSETDOM call, 
    the winds will be rotated to match the projection.

3.  Pressure is the vertical coordinate reported in the satellite wind products,
    and is returned along with the horizontal coordinates (lat/lon) in the
    MSATWNDSTA call.  If a height coordinate is desired, the user can select
    the HT variable, and the MADIS API will use the U.S. Standard Atmosphere
    calculation to return a pressure altitude.

4.  The results of the automated quality control schemes used in the production
    of the satellite winds at NESDIS are available via the MADIS API.  These
    include the CIMMS/NESDIS recursive filter flag (RFF) and the EUMETSAT
    quality indicator (QI).  There are two forms of the QI, the first provides
    the QI results where no background model data has been used in its
    determination, and the second gives the results where background model
    data has been used.  RFF values range from 0 (worst) to 100 (best).  Winds 
    having RFF values less than about 45 are filtered out of the dataset before
    being output by NESDIS.  QI values range from 0 (worst) to 1 (best).  

    For more information on the RFF processing see:  

       Hayden, C.M. and R.J. Purser, 1995: Recursive filter objective analysis
       of meteorological fields, applications to NESDIS operational processing.
       J. Appl. Meteor., 34, 3-15.

       satellite-derived atmospheric motion vectors to derive quality indicators.

* The QC information is only available with the FSL database.  

** The QI's and the LSM (for the FSL database) aren't yet available (as of 10/03) 
   in the data files.  These are expected to be added sometime in the next several
   months.  When they are added, no MADIS API changes will be needed -- you will
   just start seeing non-missing data when you ask for these variables.
