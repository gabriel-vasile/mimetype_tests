-STATUTE-
      (a) This chapter applies to all captures of vessels as prize
    during war by authority of the United States or adopted and
    ratified by the President. However, this chapter does not affect
    the right of the Army or the Air Force, while engaged in
    hostilities, to capture wherever found and without prize procedure -
     
        (1) enemy property; or
        (2) neutral property used or transported in violation of the
      obligations of neutrals under international law.

      (b) As used in this chapter - 
        (1) "vessel" includes aircraft; and
        (2) "master" includes the pilot or other person in command of
      an aircraft.

      (c) Property seized or taken upon the inland waters of the United
    States by its naval forces is not maritime prize. All such property
    shall be delivered promptly to the proper officers of the courts.
      (d) Nothing in this chapter may be construed as contravening any
    treaty of the United States.

    --------------------------------------------------------------------

      In subsection (a) the words "including aircraft" are omitted as
    covered by subsection (b). The section is written to make the words
    "during war" applicable to the entire chapter. These words appear
    in 34 U.S.C. 1159, but not in 34 U.S.C. 1131. Prize is historically
    and uniformly treated as a war-time matter, so no substantive
    change results from the extension. The words "this chapter does not
    affect" are substituted for the words "nothing herein contained
    shall be construed as affecting, or in any way impairing". The
    words "Air Force" are added under authority of Sec. 305(a) of the
    National Security Act of 1947, as amended (5 U.S.C. 171l), to
    provide the same applicability as formerly provided by the word
    "Army". The word "legal" is omitted as surplusage.
      In subsection (b) the definition of the term "ship" is omitted as
    covered by the term "vessel". All of 34 U.S.C. 1132 except that
    part which includes "aircraft" within the term "vessels" is omitted
    as unnecessary since the defined term "vessels of the Navy" does
    not appear in the provisions to which the definition is made
    applicable. The last sentence of 34 U.S.C. 1158 applies only to
    Title LIV (Prize) of the Revised Statutes. In subsection (d) it is
    broadened to cover the entire body of statutory prize law.
    Additions to the prize law made by the Act of August 18, 1942, ch.
    553, 56 Stat. 746, as amended, operated only to extend the
    jurisdiction of courts of the United States to certain cases in
    which the prizes are not brought into the territorial waters of the
    United States. Relations of this country with other countries are
    not affected by the 1942 Act except when jurisdiction is exercised
    by American courts over prizes brought into cobelligerent ports. As
    that Act provides that the consent of the cobelligerent is
    necessary to the exercise of such jurisdiction, the rule against
    contravention of treaties is properly applied to it.

-STATUTE-
      (a) The United States district courts have original jurisdiction,
    exclusive of the courts of the States, of each prize and each
    proceeding for the condemnation of property taken as prize, if the
    prize is - 
        (1) brought into the United States, or the Commonwealths or
      possessions;
        (2) brought into the territorial waters of a cobelligerent;
        (3) brought into a locality in the temporary or permanent
      possession of, or occupied by, the armed forces of the United
      States; or
        (4) appropriated for the use of the United States.

      (b) The United States district courts, exclusive of the courts of
    the States, also have original jurisdiction of a prize cause in
    which the prize property - 
        (1) is lost or entirely destroyed; or
        (2) cannot be brought in for adjudication because of its
      condition.

      (c) The jurisdiction conferred by this section of prizes brought
    into the territorial waters of a cobelligerent may not be
    exercised, nor may prizes be appropriated for the use of the United
    States within those territorial waters, unless the government
    having jurisdiction over those waters consents to the exercise of
    the jurisdiction or to the appropriation.

                                                Sec. 3, 56 Stat. 746.   
    --------------------------------------------------------------------

      Subsection (a) reflects 28 U.S.C. 1333 by restating the basic
    prize jurisdiction of that section over prizes brought into the
    United States, and by providing that the extension of prize
    jurisdiction conferred by 34 U.S.C. 1159 on the United States
    district courts is exclusive of the courts of the States. 34 U.S.C.
    1166 and the second sentence of 34 U.S.C. 1164 are executed in the
    single jurisdictional statement of this section and the
    consolidation of the Act of August 18, 1942, ch. 553, 56 Stat. 746
    (34 U.S.C. 1159-1166) with the earlier prize provisions. The words
    "during war" in 34 U.S.C. 1159 are omitted as covered in Sec. 7651
    of this title. In clause (1) the words "or the Territories,
    Commonwealths, or possessions" are added, since "United States" in
    this title is geographically limited to the 48 States and the
    District of Columbia, whereas the term here is intended to include
    all places within the jurisdiction of the district courts.
      In clause (4) the words "taken or" preceding the words
    "appropriated for the use of the United States" are omitted as
    surplusage and in order to avoid confusion between the two meanings
    of the word "taken" in prize law. In both the Revised Statutes and
    the 1942 Act the phrase "taken or appropriated" means no more than
    "appropriated" alone, whereas "taken", in the phrase "taken as
    prize" means "captured".
      Subsection (b) is included to make the statement of jurisdiction
    complete. It is derived by implication from the first sentence of
    R.S. 4625 (34 U.S.C. 1141) which is the source of subsection (c) of
    Sec. 7653 of this title.

                                AMENDMENTS                            
      2006 - Subsec. (a)(1). Pub. L. 109-163 substituted "Commonwealths
    or possessions" for "Territories, Commonwealths, or possessions".

      (a) If a prize is brought into a port of the United States, or
    the Commonwealths or possessions, proceedings for the adjudication
    of the prize cause shall be brought in the district in which the
    port is located.
      (b) If a prize is brought into the territorial waters of a
    cobelligerent, or is brought into a locality in the temporary or
    permanent possession of, or occupied by, the armed forces of the
    United States, or is appropriated for the use of the United States,
    before proceedings are started, the venue of the proceedings for
    adjudication of the cause shall be in the judicial district
    selected by the Attorney General, or his designee, for the
    convenience of the United States.
      (c) If the prize property is lost or entirely destroyed or if,
    because of its condition, no part of it has been or can be sent in
    for adjudication, proceedings for adjudication of the cause may be
    brought in any district designated by the Secretary of the Navy. In
    such cases the proceeds of anything sold shall be deposited with
    the Treasurer of the United States or public depositary in or
    nearest the district designated by the Secretary, subject to the
    orders of the court for that district.

      Subsection (a) is inserted in order to present a complete
    statement of the subject matter of the section. Its substance is
    not specifically set out in the Revised Statutes but is strongly
    implied in 34 U.S.C. 1135 which requires the United States attorney
    for the district in which the port is located to file a libel.
      In subsection (b) the requisites for jurisdiction conferred under
    the 1942 Act are substituted for the words "brought under the
    jurisdiction conferred by this Act". The substituted words are the
    same as those used in clauses (2), (3), and (4) of the preceding
    section except that the words "before proceedings are started" are
    added following the words "appropriated for the use of the United
    States" for clarity. An appropriation can take place before or
    after proceedings are commenced, but in the latter case there is no
    occasion for the Attorney General to determine venue.
      In subsection (c) the words "or if because the whole has been
    appropriated to the use of the United States" and the words "or the
    value of anything taken or appropriated for the use of the United
    States" are omitted. The provision in the 1942 Act which empowers
    the Attorney General to decide the venue of proceedings when the
    prize property has been appropriated is incompatible with the
    provision in R.S. 4625 which authorizes the Secretary of the Navy
    to select the judicial district in such cases. Hence the 1942 Act
    superseded R.S. 4625 with respect to cases of this type. Deposit of
    the value of prize property appropriated by the United States is
    adequately covered in Sec. 7663 of this title and is not mentioned
    here. The second sentence of 34 U.S.C. 1141 (R.S. 4625), relating
    to proceedings by captors, is omitted because it was rendered
    inoperative by the Act of March 3, 1899, ch. 413, Sec. 13, 30 Stat.
    1007, which repealed all laws authorizing the distribution of prize
    money to captors.

                                AMENDMENTS                            
      2006 - Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 109-163 substituted "Commonwealths or
    possessions" for "Territories, Commonwealths, or possessions".

    Sec. 7655. Appointment of prize commissioners and special prize
      commissioners

-STATUTE-
      (a) In each judicial district there may be not more than three
    prize commissioners, one of whom is the naval prize commissioner.
    They shall be appointed by the district court for service in
    connection with any prize cause in which proceedings are brought
    under section 7653(a) or (c) of this title. The naval prize
    commissioner must be an officer of the Navy whose appointment is
    approved by the Secretary of the Navy. The naval prize commissioner
    shall protect the interests of the Department of the Navy in the
    prize property. At least one of the other commissioners must be a
    member of the bar of the court, of not less than three years'
    standing, who is experienced in taking depositions.
      (b) A district court may appoint special prize commissioners to
    perform abroad, in connection with any prize cause in which
    proceedings are brought under section 7653(b) of this title, the
    duties prescribed for prize commissioners, and, in connection with
    those causes, to exercise anywhere such additional powers and
    perform such additional duties as the court considers proper,
    including the duties prescribed by this chapter for United States
    marshals. The court may determine the number and qualifications of
    the special prize commissioners it appoints, except that for each
    cause there shall be at least one naval special prize commissioner.
    The naval special prize commissioner must be an officer of the Navy
    whose appointment is approved by the Secretary. The naval special
    prize commissioner shall protect the interests of the Department of
    the Navy in the prize property.

    --------------------------------------------------------------------

      The first sentence of subsection (a) is reworded to make it clear
    that the limitation as to number applies to the number of prize
    commissioners who may serve in each judicial district at any one
    time and that the court is not precluded from making additional
    appointments to fill vacancies. The words "for service in
    connection with any prize cause in which proceedings are brought
    under section 7653(a) or (c) of this title" are added to
    distinguish the prize commissioners from the special prize
    commissioners mentioned in subsection (b). The words "officer of
    the Navy" in subsections (a) and (b) are substituted for the words
    "naval officer, active or retired" because an officer of the Navy
    does not lose his status as such upon retirement, and to retain
    these words would open to question the many other provisions in
    this subtitle treating retired officers as officers.
      In subsection (b) the words "in connection with any prize cause
    in which proceedings are brought under section 7653(b) of this
    title" are substituted for the words "in cases arising under this
    Act" for accuracy of reference. The words "including the duties
    prescribed by this chapter for United States marshals" are added
    for clarity. Section 7662 of this title prescribes the duties of
    marshals. Most of these duties could not be performed by the
    marshals if the prize was not brought into a United States port. In
    such cases occurring during World War II the courts, under the
    authority of the 1942 Act, required the special prize commissioners
    to perform the duties ordinarily performed by the marshals. The
    words "without regard for the requirements of section 7367 of this
    title" are omitted as unnecessary, since that section is codified
    in subsection (a), and language distinguishing the prize
    commissioners from the special prize commissions is included in
    each subsection.

      log, and the documents of cargo, together with all other

    probable claimants.
      (c) If the captured vessel, or any part of the captured property,
    is not in condition to be sent in for adjudication, the commanding
    officer of the capturing vessel shall have a survey and an
    appraisal made by competent and impartial persons. The reports of
    the survey and the appraisal shall be sent to the court in which
    proceedings are to be had. Property so surveyed and appraised,
    unless appropriated for the use of the United States, shall be sold
    under authority of the commanding officer present. Proceeds of the
    sale shall be deposited with the Treasurer of the United States or
    in the public depositary most accessible to the court in which
    proceedings are to be had and subject to its order in the cause.

-STATUTE-
      The marshal shall - 
        (1) keep in his custody all persons found on board a prize and
      sent in as witnesses, until they are released by the prize
      commissioners or the court;
        (2) keep safely in his custody all prize property under warrant
      from the court;
        (3) report to the court any cargo or other property that he
      thinks should be unloaded and stored or sold;
        (4) insure the prize property, if in his judgment it is in the
      interest of all concerned;
        (5) have charge of the sale of the property, if a sale is
      ordered, and be responsible for the conduct of the sale in the
      manner required by the court, for the collection of the gross
      proceeds, and for their immediate deposit with the Treasurer of
      the United States or public depositary nearest the place of sale,
      subject to the order of the court in the cause; and
        (6) submit to the Secretary of the Navy, at such times as the
      Secretary designates, a full statement of the condition of the
      prize and of the disposal made thereof.

      In clause (5) the words "and be responsible for" are inserted for

    the proceeds shall be made by the auctioneer and his agent rather
    than by the marshal, although the marshal supervises them. The

    Sec. 7663. Prize property appropriated for the use of the United
      States

-STATUTE-
      (a) Any officer or agency designated by the President may
    appropriate for the use of the United States any captured vessel,
    arms, munitions, or other material taken as prize. The department
    or agency for whose use the prize property is appropriated shall
    deposit the value of the property with the Treasurer of the United
    States or with the public depositary nearest to the court in which
    the proceedings are to be had, subject to the orders of the court.
      (b) Whenever any captured vessel, arms, munitions, or other
    material taken as prize is appropriated for the use of the United
    States before that property comes into the custody of the prize
    court, it shall be surveyed, appraised, and inventoried by persons
    as competent and impartial as can be obtained, and the survey,
    appraisal, and inventory sent to the court in which the proceedings
    are to be had. If the property is appropriated after it comes into
    the custody of the court, sufficient notice shall be given to
    enable the court to have the property appraised for the protection
    of the rights of the claimants.
      (c) Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b), in any case where
    prize property is appropriated for the use of the United States, a
    prize court may adjudicate the cause on the basis of an inventory
    and survey and an appropriate undertaking by the United States to
    respond for the value of the property, without either an appraisal
    or a deposit of the value of the prize with the Treasurer of the
    United States or a public depositary.

    --------------------------------------------------------------------

      In subsection (a) the words "may appropriate" are substituted for
    the words "the power to take or appropriate * * * may be
    exercised", in 34 U.S.C. 1162, for clarity and uniformity of
    statement. Under the Revised Statutes it was implied and understood
    that the Navy could appropriate prizes on behalf of the United
    States for use by the Navy. Use by other government agencies was
    not contemplated. The 1942 Act enabled the Navy to turn prize
    vessels over to the War Shipping Administration without bringing
    them back to United States ports. Reference to that Administration
    in subsection (a) is omitted since the Administration has been
    abolished and these functions have not been specifically vested in
    its successors. It is surplusage as well, because the authority to
    appropriate is given to any officer or agency designated by the
    President.
      The proviso added to R.S. 4624 (34 U.S.C. 1140) by the 1945
    amendment is identical with the proviso added to the 1942 Act (34
    U.S.C. 1162) by the 1944 amendment. The 1945 Act completed the
    process of making the procedure under the Revised Statutes the same
    as that in effect for causes over which the courts were given
    jurisdiction by the World War II legislation, and its single
    statement in subsection (c) is therefore justified.
      34 U.S.C. 1140 and the revised section reflect the Act of March
    3, 1899, ch. 413, Sec. 13, 30 Stat. 1007, which repealed laws
    authorizing distribution of prize proceeds to captors, and the Act
    of May 29, 1920, ch. 214, 41 Stat. 654, which requires substitution
    of "Treasurer of the United States or public depositary" for
    "assistant treasurer".

      value;
        (2) the court is satisfied that the rights and interests of the
      United States or of other claimants will not be prejudiced;
        (3) an opportunity is given to the United States attorney and
      the naval prize commissioner or the naval special prize
      commissioner to be heard as to the appointment of appraisers; and
        (4) a satisfactory appraisal is made.

      (b) Money collected on a stipulation, or deposited instead of it,
    that does not represent costs shall be deposited with the Treasurer
    of the United States or a public depositary in the same manner as

    Sec. 7667. Transfer of prize property to another district for sale

-STATUTE-
      (a) In the case of any prize property ordered to be sold, if the
    court believes that it will be in the interest of all parties to
    have the property sold in a judicial district other than the one in
    which the proceedings are pending, the court may direct the marshal
    to transfer the property to the district selected by the court for
    the sale, and to insure it. In such a case the court shall give the
    marshal proper orders as to the time and manner of conducting the
    sale.
      (b) When so ordered the marshal shall transfer the property and
    keep it safely. He is responsible for its sale in the same manner
    as if the property were in his own district and for the deposit of
    the gross proceeds with the Treasurer of the United States or
    public depositary nearest to the place of sale, subject to the
    order of the court for the district where the adjudication is
    pending.
      (c) The necessary expenses of insuring, transferring, receiving,
    keeping, and selling the property are a charge upon it and upon the
    proceeds. Whenever any such expense is paid in advance by the
    marshal, any amount not repaid to him from the proceeds shall be
    allowed to him as in the case of expenses incurred in suits in
    which the United States is a party.
      (d) If the Secretary of the Navy believes that it will be in the
    interest of all parties to have the property sold in a judicial
    district other than the one in which the proceedings are pending,
    he may, either by a general regulation or by a special direction in
    the cause, require the marshal to transfer the property from the
    district in which the judicial proceedings are pending to any other
    district for sale. In such a case proceedings shall be had as if
    the transfer had been made by order of the court.

      In subsection (b) the words "He is responsible for its sale" are
    substituted for the words "It shall be the duty of the marshal to *

    --------------------------------------------------------------------

      R.S. 4630 provided that in some circumstances the captors were to
    receive the net proceeds of prize property and in other
    circumstances they were to receive half and the United States was
    to receive the other half. The Act of March 3, 1899, ch. 413, Sec.
    13, 30 Stat. 1007, repealed "all provisions of law authorizing the
    distribution among captors of the whole or any portion of the
    proceeds of vessels, or any property hereafter captured, condemned
    as prize". Thus the only part of R.S. 4630 that remains in effect,
    as is indicated in 34 U.S.C. 1151, is that part which provides that
    proceeds shall be decreed to the United States. The section is so
    worded. R.S. 4641 stated how proceeds decreed to captors should be
    divided among them. These provisions were eliminated by the Act of
    March 3, 1899, supra. All that remains of R.S. 4641, as is
    indicated in 34 U.S.C. 1151, is the provision that proceeds decreed
    to the United States shall be paid into the Treasury, and the
    section is worded accordingly.

    Sec. 7672. Recaptures: award of salvage, costs, and expenses

-STATUTE-
      (a) If a vessel or other property that has been captured by a
    force hostile to the United States is recaptured, and the court
    believes that the property had not been condemned as prize by
    competent authority before its recapture, the court shall award an
    appropriate sum as salvage.
      (b) If the recaptured property belonged to the United States, it
    shall be restored to the United States, and costs and expenses
    ordered to be paid by the court shall be paid from the Treasury.
      (c) If the recaptured property belonged to any person residing
    within or under the protection of the United States, the court
    shall restore the property to its owner upon his claim and on
    payment of such sum as the court may award as salvage, costs, and
    expenses.
      (d) If the recaptured property belonged to any person permanently
    residing within the territory and under the protection of any
    foreign government in amity with the United States, and, by the law
    or usage of that government, the property of a citizen of the
    United States would be restored under like circumstances of
    recapture, the court shall, upon the owner's claim, restore the
    property to him under such terms as the law or usage of that
    government would require of a citizen of the United States under
    like circumstances. If no such law or usage is known, the property
    shall be restored upon the payment of such salvage, costs, and
    expenses as the court orders.
      (e) Amounts awarded as salvage under this section shall be paid
    to the United States.

    --------------------------------------------------------------------

      In subsection (c) the words "restore the property" are
    substituted for the words "adjudge to be restored." A similar
    substitution is made in subsection (d).
      In subsection (d) the words "foreign government" are substituted
    for the words "foreign prince, government, or state".
      Subsection (e) is derived from the next to the last sentence of
    R.S. 4652 which, when enacted, read:
      "The whole amount awarded as salvage shall be decreed to the
    captors and no part to the United States, and shall be distributed
    as in the case of proceeds of property condemned as prize."
      The Act of March 3, 1899, ch. 413, Sec. 13, 30 Stat. 1007,
    repealed all laws authorizing the distribution of prize money to
    captors. Accordingly, 34 U.S.C. 1158 states:
      "The whole amount awarded as salvage shall be disposed of as in
    the case of proceeds of property condemned as prize."
      As shown in Sec. 7668 of this title, the net proceeds of property
    condemned as prize must be decreed to the United States. Subsection
    (e) is phrased so as to state directly, instead of by reference,
    the fact that the amount awarded as salvage is paid to the
    government. While this is apparently inconsistent with R.S. 4652 as
    originally enacted, it is consistent with the intent expressed by
    Congress in the provision of the Act of March 3, 1899 (supra),
    which repealed provisions relating to the distribution of prize
    money and bounty to crews. This act, it is true, did not mention
    salvage; and salvage money is still occasionally awarded to crews
    of naval vessels. However, such occasions are rare, and it is the
    general policy of the Department of the Navy not to claim salvage
    on behalf of its personnel. No case appears in which salvage
    derived from prize has been claimed for such personnel. Prize
    salvage is more closely related to prize money than it is to other
    salvage. The determination by Congress that captors should not
    share in the proceeds of prizes is, therefore, as in 34 U.S.C.
    1158, carried through the revised section to salvage derived from
    prize. The word "amounts" is substituted for the words "the whole
    amount".

      In subsection (c) the words "on the anniversary of his
    appointment" are inserted for clarity, as "year" in the context of
    this section means a year of service as prize commissioner. The
    words "and shall be credited to the fund for paying naval pensions"
    are omitted because the Act of June 26, 1934, ch. 756, Sec. 9, 48
    Stat. 1229, abolished the naval pension fund and provided that
    moneys previously required to be paid into it should be deposited
    in the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts. The words "as
    miscellaneous receipts" are omitted as surplusage. The word
    "amounts" is substituted for the word "sums".
      34 U.S.C. 1154 and 1155 and this section reflect the Act of May
    28, 1896, ch. 252, Sec. 6, 29 Stat. 179, 180, which provided that
    United States attorneys should receive fixed annual salaries in
    lieu of the fees and emoluments previously authorized.
