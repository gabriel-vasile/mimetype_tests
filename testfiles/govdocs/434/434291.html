     and Maryland Regional Medical Program Funds)
AB:  A program of health education was instituted in 1974 in three
     counties of Appalachian Maryland, beginning in fifth grade
     and designed eventually to include sixth and seventh grades.
     The first phase was a workshop for approximately 165 teachers
     designed to take them through the same learning experiences
     that they would provide to their own students. Results of a
     questionnaire administered to the teachers at the end of the
     workshop are presented. At the beginning of the year, a 54-item
     test of knowledge about the lungs and respiratory system was
     administered to the fifth grade pupils; it was readministered
     at the end of the year. Mean scores for the group increased from
     19 to 27. This gain was judged to be statistically significant.
     Parents of the children also replied to a questionnaire about
     their attitudes and opinions. The responses to this questionnaire
     are presented. In general, the questionnaires elicited very
     favorable responses. (CTM).

AB:  Routine transmission of electrocardiograms and their computer
     interpretation via long-distance telephone lines has been
     proven feasible in the automated electrocardiogram project
     of the Missouri Regional Medical Program. Though this pilot
     project, the first on a state-wide basis, is still viewed as
     an applied research effort rather than a service, such biotelemetry
     is rapidly gaining acceptance as a medium to bring modern medicine,
     through modern technology, to bothurban and remote rural
     areas. The computer executes all the wave measurements and
     calculations with incredible speed. It takes over a boring,
     repetitive part of the physician&#39;s work. However, it can only
     follow the instructions of the diagnostic program, compiled
     by expert cardiologists.

AB:  An automated computer network for analyzing electrocardiograms
     is operated by the Missouri Regional Medical Program. The
     system is based at the Medical Computer Center of Missouri
     University&#39;s Columbia Campus. Cardiac Data Acquisition
     Stations are located in physician&#39;s offices and hospitals
     as far away as 300 miles. Normal long-distance telephone lines
     are used for bidirectional communications. Different settings
     are chosen deliberately for this first pilot project. They
     range from a General Practitioner&#39;s office in a remote rural
     area to a University Medical Center. The system is a replica
     of that developed by the U.S. Public Health Service.

TI:  Design of an educational environment with a computer-controlled
     organ. Salt Lake City: Intermountain Regional Medical Progam;
     1973. 2 p
AB:  The primary objective of this project was to design a responsive
     environment using a computer-controlled organ for children
     to learn music principles. Three secondary objectives set
     in the development of this environment were to create the means
     for: 1) entering, storing, and replaying complex music; 2)
     viewing the time-space relationships inherent in music;
     3) controlling and manipulating music. A computer-controlled
     electronic concert organ was programmed to enable a wide variety
     of musical composition manipulation from changing key to
     synthesizing musical parts. Line drawings on a graphics scope
     displayed music information that could be redrawn at will.
     Music manipulation was accomplished with keyboard, computer
     terminal, and lightpen buttons. Response from 13 children
     ages 4-12 and a few adults was very favorable--the graphics
     scope being especially successful for grasping correlation
     of parts of a score. The developmental basis of the system shows
     great potential for generating data to compare with data gathered
     from traditional teaching methods. (JH).

TI:  Emergency!! A core curriculum for continuing education in
     emergency care. Lincoln (NB): Nebraska Regional Medical
     Program; 1975. 83 p
AB:  Intended as a guide for developing emergency medical-care
     training, these six curriculum outlines have been used and
     adapted to the personnel development needs of both the rural
     community hospital and the large metropolitan hospital.
     The outlines are preceded by a discussion of the principles
     of learning by John George, who emphasizes the importance
     of the learner&#39;s direct involvement and participation at
     all levels of curriculum planning and implementation. Each
     outline then presents a broad objective for every subtopic,
     a summary outline of content for that part of the program, and
     a list of behavioral objectives to be completed. The first
     of six outlines covers general information on emergency medical
     services including studies in the organization and staffing
     of the emergency room, the communications, policies and protocol,
     and legal considerations. Outlines 2, 3, 4, and 5 cover emergency
     care for patients with respiratory problems, with cardiac
     problems, in trauma, and involved in other medical emergencies.
     Finally, the guide concludes with study outlines in the special
     categories of burn therapy, pediatric emergencies, obstetrical
     emergencies, and psychiatric emergencies. (BM).

TI:  Framework for evaluation of the proposals submitted to the
     New Jersey Regional Medical Program. New Brunswick (NJ):
     Rutgers, the State University, Bureau of Economic Research;
     1968. 63 p
AB:  Each of nine proposals submitted to the New Jersey Regional
     Medical Program for funding are reviewed and methods for their
     evaluation are suggested. A brief, general discussion of
     the difficulties encountered in estimating costs and quantifying
     the benefits of the projects is followed by examinations of
     the individual projects. Benefit-cost analysis attempts
     to identify cost and benefit components of a given proposal
     and to compare them. This analysis necessitates measurement
     of all pertinent variables in terms of a common denominator,
     usually dollar units. Some of the individual proposals described
     include: programs designed to train registered nurses in
     intensive coronary care in courses arranged to embrace both
     teaching and clinical experience for trainees; an external
     cardiopulmonary resuscitation training program which would
     train a variety of medical and nonmedical personnel in two
     stages; a training program in the technique of coronary cineangiography
     for four cardiologists or cardiovascular surgeons; a service
     and research project to evaluate the status of 1,000 New Jersey
     patients with implanted pacemakers; and a program for establishing
     recognized tumor conference boards within New Jersey hospitals
     designed to improve patient care directly.

SO:  Bull Med Libr Assoc 1972 Jan:115-20
AB:  The Pacific Northwest Regional Health Sciences Library and
     the Washington/Alaska Regional Medical Program jointly
     conducted a service to provide photocopies of articles on
     cancer topics within twenty-four hours after receiving telephone
     requests for information from Central Washington physicians.
     AIM-TWX was utilized as the initial source of references whenever
     possible, and its benefit as such was evaluated. A sample of
     requests showed AIM-TWX to have reduced the total work time
     per search; moreover, when it was used, AIM-TWX retrieved
     more than 70% of the articles selected to be sent. Physician
     response indicated that the service was both needed and appreciated.
     Further investigation by a similar information service is
     suggested.

     Program; 1970. 129 p
AB:  A comprehensive statement and presentation of data pertaining
     to fifteen Iowa health manpower occupations are made for units
     of State and Federal Government, health and professional
     organizations, health planners, and lay groups involved
     in health and other socioeconomic planning activities. The
     industrialization of Iowa with attendant decline in the importance
     of agriculture has led to population shifts to the cities,
     concentrating health services into larger, more economical
     units. Health professionals and support personnel are also
     becoming scarce in rural areas but their regional concentration,
     coupled with improvements in transportation and communication,
     make possible a wider spectrum of health care than could have
     been provided in the past. This suggests that policy decisions
     should be made on the basis of the total functioning of the health
     industry. (MS).

TI:  Health care, health and illness behavior of American Indians
     in the state of Maine. Augusta (ME): Maine&#39;s Regional Medical
     Program Research and Evaluation Service; 1971. 214 p
AB:  This research monograph reports findings based on studies
     conducted by Maine&#39;s Regional Medical Program Research and
     Evaluation Service from interviews of 90 families in Indian
     communities. The report covers self-evaluation of health,
     patterns and sources of medical care, attitudes toward health
     care, perception of services, and survey results. The data
     shows that over three-fourths of the families have various
     health and medical problems which need immediate attention.
     These problems range from chronic medical conditions and
     dental care needs to inadequate physical and sanitary conditions.
     Medical problems are seen as being closely related to poverty,
     lack of services and previous illness. The multitude of health
     and health-related problems faced by American Indian families
     are further accentuated by the present health care system.
     Ill health of the poor is accentuated by high medical costs,
     inequitable distribution of health personnel and facilities
     and a loosely integrated system of health care delivery. A
     high percentage of the families are receptive to proposed
     services and facilities. (Author/WS).

AB:  This study on health care and health and illness of low income
     families is based on findings from interviews with 301 low-income
     families in the state of Maine. The findings show that a majority
     of the families have various health or medical problems which
     need immediate attention. These problems range from dental
     care and chronic medical conditions to inadequate physical
     and sanitary conditions. These families lack access to medical
     services and facilities and show a low utilization of existing
     services. Many of the families use folk-medicines and remedies
     for health care. Lack of financial resources is the primary
     reason reported for lack of accessibility to a doctor. A direct
     relationship was found between socio-economic status and
     health and illness behavior patterns. A very high proportion
     of the families appear to be receptive to proposed services
     and facilities such as health screening programs and community
     health centers or clinics. (Author/WS).

     80 p
AB:  Additional support was provided by the South Dakota Regional
     Medical Program and the South Dakota State Department of Health.
     The South Dakota Core Curriculum Project involving the career
     ladder approach to health manpower training, which began
     in 1970, had seven objectives including the following: (1)
     To organize a Health Manpower Council for the entire State;
     (2) to define the areas of basic commonality among the various
     training programs; and (3) to develop a core curriculum for
     health manpower training on a statewide basis. Over a 3-year
     period, the Health Manpower Council (70 representatives
     from educational, health-care, and related institutions),
     through the work of its eight subcommittees and three council
     workshops, developed a core curriculum. This curriculum
     allows a student ultimately to possess a foundation of knowledge
     and skills on which to build occupational mobility and permit
     an upward academic pursuit. (The appendix, comprising three-fourths
     of this report, contains the curriculum&#39;s topical content
     outline and 785 measurable behavioral objectives. The content
     is in two segments: (1) Primary level--that collection of
     fundamental tasks, skills, knowledge, and attitudes common
     to all health manpower training/education curricula--which
     includes three units: Health Care Delivery System, Introduction
     to Health Science, and Emergency Medical Care; and (2) secondary
     level--that collection which is common to more than one type
     of curricula--which includes six areas: Anatomy and physiology,
     chemistry, interpersonal relationships, microbiology,
     nutrition, and public health and health-care delivery. )

AB:  This project was conducted and administered jointly by the
     Student Health Organization of Chicago and the Presbyterian-St.
     Luke&#39;s Hospital, Chicago.The Student Health Projects (SHPs)
     were conceived more than 3 years ago by students in the health
     sciences as a primary step in their efforts to enhance the quality
     of their educational experience. The Chicago Student Health
     Project was devised, organized, and directed by members of
     the Student Health Organization. The format of this report
     is as follows: an introduction concerning the implications
     of the project for students; a background note discussing
     the implications of the summer&#39;s work for the Regional Medical
     Program; then an overview of some of the problems faced by the
     project is presented, dealing in depth with the black/white
     confrontation. The body of the report consists of two sections,
     the first composed of reports on the community sites where
     the students worked and the second an analysis of the work performed
     at a number of hospital sites. The final section presents a
     brief analysis of some selected characteristics of the participating
     students. (Author/PG).

AB:  Also sponsored by the New Mexico Regional Medical Program,
     Albuquerque.  This curriculum guide outlines the subject
     matter, techniques,demonstrations presented to medical
     and paramedical personnel in a 1-week course offered at the
     New Mexico Pulmonary Center on the diagnostic evaluation
     of and the use of the most recent therapeutic techniques for
     children with chronic respiratory disorders. The manual&#39;s
     five sections are each divided into several content areas.
     Approximately one-third of the content is presented in outline
     form while the remainder is discussed in more detail and includes,
     in some instances, references, diagrams, and charts. The
     five sections with some representative subdivisions are
     as follows: (1) Basic Clinical Evaluation (Laboratory Evaluation
     and Pediatric Skin Testing by the Scratch Method); (2) Clinical
     Syndromes (The Mechanics of Ventilation and Respiratory
     Allergies in Children); (3) Acute Respiratory Emergencies
     (Acute Respiratory Failure and Mechanical Ventilation of
     the Lungs); (4) Supportive Therapy (Psychological Aspects
     of Children with Chronic Pulmonary Disease and Living with
     Cystic Fibrosis); and (5) Inhalation Therapy (The Principles
     of Inhalation Therapy and Inhalation Therapy for Infants).
     The appendix comprises about one-half of the manual and includes
     information on the Pulmonary Center; hospital aids such as
     a pediatric emergency cart; postural drainage instructions;
     airway obstruction; inhalation therapy; and pulmonary function
     aids such as the predicted values for maximum breathing capacity
     in children. (EM).

     a difference in health care delivery. New Haven (CT): The Program;
     1972-1976
AB:  These volumes of weekly Newsletters discusses significant
     developments in health care delivery in Connecticut from
     the spring of 1970 to the fall of 1972. The first issue of the
     Newsletter had the purpose of reporting on matters of concern
     to the health and welfare of the people of Connecticut, with
     special emphasis on those activities of the Connecticut Regional
     Medical Program (CRMP). The 91 issues contained in the volume
     present subject material of two types: the administrative
     functioning of CRMP and its parent organization, the Regional
     Medical Programs Service; and program activities throughout
     Connecticut which have been stimulated and / or supported
     by CRMP. The program activities represent the fulfillment
     of the program goals of CRMP, which emerged from the work of
     nine Statewide task forces examining the health care system
     of Connecticut and making a series of recommendations. Each
     local or regional demonstration discussed in the Newsletters
     has been developed to fulfill one or more of CRMP&#39;s program
     goals. An index is presented as an aid for identifying two or
     more letters discussing the development of a given program
     activity. Portions of this document are not fully legible.

     the implications of recent legislation and historical precedents
     on consumer health education and consumer participation
     in the health planning process; documents current activities;
     develops priorities for future efforts; discusses current
     problems in the system; and recommends actions necessary
     to insure adequacy and quality in consumer health education.
     The plan also includes an analysis of inventories of current
     or potential activities or providers of consumer health;
     mortality and morbidity data for the Orange County planning
     region; documentation of existing planning and coordination
     efforts; discussion of coordinated activities promoting
     innovation and creative approaches, barriers to current
     health care and health education utilization, and the need
     for a comprehensive consumer health education dissemination
     system. The need and possible methods to insure participation
     from consumers who represent consumer/community-based
     interests are also addressed. It is recommended that a single
     agency be designated to plan, coordinate, and implement a
     comprehensive consumer health education system with appropriate
     level of funding to discharge responsibilities. (Author/BM).

AB:  The objectives of a hospital are to improve patient care, while
     the objectives of a hospital library are to improve services
     to the staff which will support their efforts. This handbook
     dealing with hospital administration is designed to aid the
     librarian in either implementing a hospital library, or improving
     services in an existing medical library. The librarian&#39;s
     tasks are identified and discussed under two major categories:
     (1) planning, which involves organizing, financing, and
     budgeting for library services; and (2) control, which includes
     the development of annual reports, policies and procedures,
     and coordination and leadership. A glossary of library terms,
     a checklist of patient care standards, and hospital library
     standards are appended. (AP).

AB:  Addressed to the administrator of the hospital as well as the
     librarian, this handbook covers aspects of library service
     policy and long-range planning. While hospitals of all sizes
     are discussed, a special effort is made to cover problems of
     small hospitals (17 to 100 beds) in sparsely-settled regions.
     Contents: The library as a clinical service, Standards and
     accreditation (including reprints of standards of the JOINT
     Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals and of the Connecticut

     Regional Medical Libraries, and national organizations;
     and a reprint of the evaluation questionnaire for libraries
     used by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals.
     However, emphasis of the text is on cost-benefit factors rather

     City: Intermountain Regional Medical Program; 1972. 63 p.
     (Hospital library handbooks, no. 3)
AB:  Regardless of the size of the hospital, the librarian must
     acquire information for staff members by whatever means possible.
     Large hospitals with large staff, more information requests
     per week, and a better economic base will purchase a greater
     number of information materials. Small hospitals will purchase
     only the most basic reference books and bibliographies, and
     will depend on interlibrary loans to supply specific items
     for one-time use by individuals. Whether the librarian is
     purchasing or borrowing, she will need to know what types of
     materials are available (indexes, abstracts, texts, journals,
     reference books, etc. ) and what kind of knowledge each type
     of material will provide. A loan request sent to another library
     includes the same descriptive data as a purchase order sent
     to a publisher or to a book agent. This handbook is mainly concerned
     with instruction for selecting and purchasing library materials.
     However, effective service through interlibrary loans requires
     just as much knowledge of basic bibliography: the world of
     books and journals and other information media. (Handbook
     No. 2 is available as ED 066 206) (Author).

AB:  This set of guidelines was written to provide a systematic
     explanation of the process of evaluation applied to Regional
     Medical Programs, as required by Public Law 89-239. Goals
     of the programs are the improvement of health care of patients
     suffering from heart disease, cancer, stroke and related
     diseases and improvement in the practice of health professionals.
     The first step in evaluation is the development of objectives--both
     immediate and long range. The second phase is the selection
     or design of measuring instruments or the design of other procedures
     to collect data that will lead to evidence for evaluation.
     Next comes the collection of data--from the health professional
     as a participant in a learning experience and as practitioner,
     and also from society. The fourth phase is analysis of the data;
     then judgment is made of how well objectives have been met.
     (A checklist is included; an appendix gives examples of decisions
     and modification. ) (PT).

     Population growth in central Florida has increased the need
     for continuing education for trauma nurses. A project was
     undertaken in 1974 to develop a comprehensive continuing
     education program on trauma nursing for registered nurses
     that can be a prototype for the state, and to implement the program
     in Orange, Seminole, and Osceola counties. Operational objectives
     were to: (1) develop a central organization and management
     unit that will plan and give direction to the project as well
     as organize, coordinate, and evaluate the project activities;
     (2) develop a modular curriculum of 80 hours on trauma nursing;
     (3) plan and implement activities for a minimum of three trauma
     nursing programs in the three counties, to enroll at least
     45 nurses; (4) develop testing and evaluation tools for the
     curriculum and the overall program; and (5) conduct an ongoing
     evaluation of the program. An extensive progress report is
     provided. A bibliography is included. (MSE).

AB:  Early in 1977, the Regional Medical Programs, established
     in 1965, ceased to function, after ups and down of agency prognosis
     for a period of more than four years, and several threatened
     cuttings off of funding from HEW. Among these agencies was
     the Illinois Regional Medical Program, serving the entire
     state. Although not unique to the IRMP, among RMP&#39;s across
     the country, that agency was unusual in performing, both through
     core staff and funding programs, many activities in the sphere
     of health information. This paper attempts to trace some of
     the more salient aspects of the Health Information activities
     of IRMP, with a view toward development of inputs to the modelling
     processes relating to health data management and dissemination
     among health planners extant today. The Health Systems Agencies,
     established in 1975, have replaced the functions of the RMP&#39;s,
     the Comprehensive Health Planning Agencies and the Hill-Burton
     Agencies. In addition other organizations have been developed
     and have evolved which may utilize the experiences of IRMP
     to benefit health planning within the areas for which they
     are responsible. Programs of IRMP included published and
     unpublished materials, from monographs to working papers,
     and involved levels of sophistication from complex geographic
     analyses to simple tabular compilations to be used by local
     health planning groups at all levels. Prepared in cooperation
     with Illinois University at the Medical Center, Chicago,
     School of Public Health. Sponsored in part by Health Resources
     Administration, Hyattsville, MD.

AB:  Members of the Veterans Administration (VA) Center, Ft. Harrison,
     Montana, and the Mountain States Regional Medical Program
     met with members of the Helena Indian Alliance and the Montana
     United Indian Association to discuss total services available
     to all veterans and their beneficiaries. Indian and VA officials
     promoted the two-way exchange of ideas on the dynamics of Indian
     culture on health care. The topics of five panel discussions
     were: &#34;The Indian Stereotype and How it Affects Health Care&#34;,
     &#34;V. A. Hospital and G.I. Benefits&#34;, &#34;Special Needs of the Urban
     Indian (Landless, Off-reservation and Federally Recognized)&#34;,
     &#34;Special Needs of the Reservation Indian&#34;, and &#34;What Indian
     Health Service Offers and Coordination With Other Health
     Services&#34;. Veterans Administration officials explained
     the requirements and procedures for taking advantage of all
     the services available to Indians. Among the specific suggestions
     and recommendations for improving services were sending
     pamphlets to Tribal Councils for distribution, having an
     Indian veteran on each reservation to work with veterans in
     identifying problems and answers, and encouraging Indian
     veterans to duplicate their discharge papers at the county
     court house. Further suggestions and recommendations, as
     well as the minutes of planning sessions that culminated in
     the workshop, are included. Veterans Administration Center,
     Fort Harrison, MT contributed to the Workshop.

     history and record of the Maryland Regional Medical Program,

     1975. 69 p
AB:  The development of regionalized health care in Maryland from
     1966 through 1975 is traced, and program activities are reviewed.
     A brief historical background is offered, and organizational
     structure, early planning and development, program planning
     objectives, and program development for initial operations
     are described.  Program activities are reviewed for 1969-71;
     these were centered around core units at the Johns Hopkins
     University, University of Maryland, and State Health Department,
     in addition to the central core unit responsible for initiating
     proposals, developing cooperative arrangements among private
     health care providers, establishing policy guidelines,
     and providing staff assistance to local projects.  Early categorical
     program activities included a program of stroke care at York
     General Hospital; a coronary care / closed chest cardiopulmonary
     resuscitation program; a continuing education program at
     Peninsula General Hospital; mass detection of heart disease
     in school children by phono-cardioscan; and a cancer control
     program.  After 1970 amendments to P.L. 91-515, a change of
     mission was undertaken.  The Maryland Regional Medical Program
     was organized into four divisions:  central administration,
     health manpower development, health care delivery, and data
     collection and evaluation.  Some demonstration programs
     and &#39;mini-projects&#39; characterizing the regional program&#39;s
     influence on health care in Maryland are described.  Plans
     for transition from the regional format to a program of new
     health system agencies throughout the State are described.
     A bibliography of the regional program&#39;s publications is

AB:  An interactive on-line computerized renal transplant matching
     system called RENTRAN, which serves the Southwest Kidney
     Transplant Region is described. The region consists of one
     transplant center in Arkansas, two in Oklahoma, and six in
     Texas. The computer used is the DECSYSTEM-10  located in the
     Medical Computing Resources Center at the University of   Texas
     Health Science Center at Dallas. RENTRAN participants have
     remotely located standard interactive computer terminals
     and gain  access to the computer by dialing over normal telephone
     lines.  Functions provided by RENTRAN include obtaining instructions,
     performing a doneor-recipient match, obtaining a list of
     potential recipients, making a user comment or adding, updating
     or deleting a patient record. Either long or short dialog forms
     are available for inexperienced and experienced users respectively.
     In the time sinceAugust 1, 1973, when the system went into production,
     there have been in excess of 100 matches attempted and approximately
     50 kidheys have been transplanted according to RENTRAN results.
     There are about 350  recipients currently on the data base.
     The system was developed with funds provided by the Texas Regional
     Medical Program amd operational  expenses and enhancements
     are provided through a $25 per year  potential-recipient patient
     charge for being listed on the data base.

TI:  Analysis of the Regional Medical Program&#39;s model cities earmarking
     process. Rockville (MD): Regional Medical Programs Service;
     1973 Jun 4. 80 p. Report No.: HRP-001468 5/2
AB:  Eight regional medical program (RMP) projects were analyzed
     during 1972 and 1973 for their impact on model cities neighborhoods.
     The eight projects represented $1 million of expenditures
     and were located in Washington, D.C.; Kansas City, Kansas;
     Salt Lake City, Utah; Detroit, Michigan; Kansas City, Missouri;
     St. Louis, Missouri; Tampa, Florida; and Tuskegee, Alabama.
     Background information was obtained on the regional medical
     program and model cities earmarking process. The eight projects
     were analyzed in terms of planning and development, implementation
     and administration, and results and impact. The initial concept
     of RMP was to provide for the rapid transfer of scientific knowledge
     to the providers of health services. One major change to RMP
     involved an expansion to increase the availability, enhance
     the quality, and contain the rising costs of medical care.
     Another significant change was a decentralization in decisionmaking
     authority from national to regional program staffs. The RMP,
     along with other DHEW categorical programs, was instructed
     to designate a portion of its resources for model cities neighborhoods.
     Judging the eight projects on the basis of establishing continuing
     health services, it was determined that the RMP earmarking
     process was a failure in producing substantive impact on model
     cities neighborhoods. No coordination with other federally
     funded or funding agencies was observed. Local agencies or
     governments were not required to provide matching funds or
     build into their budgets enough funds to support project operation.
     The eight projects are ranked in terms of their degree of success.
     Appendixes contain brief descriptions of the projects and
     an example of one completed project report.

     an inservice education program; suggested definition, philosophy,
     and objectives of inservice education; guidelines to assist
     in developing and maintaining an effective inservice education
     program; and a four-step job instructor training method which
     involves consecutively preparing the worker for training,
     presenting the job to the worker, try-out performance, and
     follow through. In the section devoted to the aforementioned
     guidelines, the following topics are discussed: useful principles
     in beginning the development of such a program; group process;
     characteristics of good inservice education programs; evaluating
     the effectiveness of inservice education programs; planning
     a program; ideas for program types; and descriptions of methods
     that may be used to implement the inservice program. (DM).

AB:  Also sponsored by the Louisiana Regional Medical Program.
     A study of the Licensed Practical Nurse (LPN), Nurse Aide (NA),
     and Homemaker-Home Health Aide (H-HHA) occupations was conducted
     during 1972-73 in Metropolitan Washington, D.C. Questionnaires
     were administered to 600 LPNs, NAs, and H-HHAs in 30 health
     facilities who rated the frequency and importance of 346 tasks.
     Usable questionnaires numbered 492. A representative sample
     of employers also rated the tasks for each job title. The data
     revealed considerable task overlap between job titles and
     between patient care settings, and much agreement between
     job titles concerning the frequency and importance of task
     performance. On this basis, the study constructed an outline
     for an experience based core curriculum containing four modular
     units of instruction and organized to provide exit points
     for various job titles leading up to the LPN level. The study
     also developed a model for community-wide involvement in
     aide education and utilization to maximize the career mobility
     and effective use of aides. Appendixes comprising 125 pages
     provide: a brief glossary; an inventory of hospitals, nursing
     homes, and providers of home health care in the Metropolitan
     Washington area; the employer and employee task inventory
     questionnaires; data cross-tabulations by patient-care
     setting, shift, education, and years of experience; and a

AB:  The implementation of the Telephone Information and Education
     System (TIES) as a statewide program available to Texas hospitals
     is discussed.  The primary objective of TIES is to deliver quality
     educational and  informational programs to hospital employees
     at the most critical point, their job site. Initial efforts
     in the development of TIES involved  surveying member hospitals
     of the Texas Hospital Association to identifycontinuing
     education needs, evaluate educational programming, field
     test a telephone conference system, and implement a financially
     self-substaining telephone information and education system.
     Through the grant for the implementation of TIES, administered
     by the Texas Hospital Association and funded by the Regional
     Medical Program of Texas, a model was devised for use in the
     implementation of the statewide telephone  conferencing
     network. The Tesas Hospital Association is to administer
     TIES and serve as the central focal point for coordination
     and  operation of the system and will match identified continuing
     education requirements and information needs of participating
     institutions to educational and informational resources.
     Recommendations are offered to facilitate the successful
     implementation of TIES. An appendix contains exhibits relating
     to the development and implementation of the system includeing
     guidelines, questionnaires, a lecturer&#39;s information booklet,
     and a manual for system management by objectives.

     p
AB:  An evaluation summary of a conference designed to identify
     and reduce the barriers to health planning is presented. A
     survey of 74 regional medical programs and comprehensive
     health planning agencies revealed eight impediments to effective
     health program planning: (1) ineffective goal and purpose
     setting; (2) a pattern of crisis intervention rather than
     preventive or long-range planning; (3) ineffective or insufficient
     community involvement; (4) unsatisfactory evaluation methods;
     (5) poor measurement of health status and health care; (6)
     the lack of interagency coordination; (7) the lack of quantifiable
     data available on health resources and needs; and (8) a reluctance
     to change since vested interests stand to lose by it. Eighteen
     agencies were represented at the conference and studied six
     techniques which would hopefully reduce the barriers to planning.
     Of the agencies using the techniques, 100 percent reported
     implementing the nominal group process, the program planning
     process, and the conflict resolution successfully; 83 percent
     using the matrix organization reported success; the delphi
     technique was successful for 73 percent; and the evaluation
     technique was reported successful by 50 percent of the staffs
     attempting to apply it. It is considered that the conference
     objectives were met to the extent that barriers were reduced.
     The survey questionnaires are appended, and tabular data
     and illustrations are provided.

SO:  Chapel Hill (NC): University of North Carolina; 217 p
AB:  A case study of the uses of information in the North Carolina
     Regional Medical Program (NCRMP), Durham, is reported. The
     study objectives included:  1) Determining the adequacy of
     available information in meeting health planning objectives;
     2) Determining the capacity of a health planning agency to
     utilize and adapt available information in fulfilling planning
     requirements; 3) Identifying approaches by which the utility
     of planning information can be enhanced; and 4) Identifying
     methods useful in developing planning information. Three
     major phases of the study included: 1) An extensive literature
     review which examined theuse of information in planning,
     methods of studying information use,  and methods by which
     planning information can be developed; 2) A review of both
     NCRMP&#39;s administrative organization and its planning and
     decision making; and 3) An analysis of information use in the
     NCRMP by examination of certain historical events and through
     assessment of personnel regarding their perceived participation
     in planning and their use of information during such planning.
     A conceptual framework of the use of information in halth planning,
     developed to aid the analysis ofthis latter phase, is discussed.

TI:  Problem-oriented assessment of the Susquehanna Valley Regional
     Medical Program. Camp Hill (PA): Susquehanna Valley Regional
     Medical Program; 1973 Mar. 56 p. Report No.: HRP-0013721/6
AB:  Information support system project activities of the Susquehanna
     Valley Regional Medical Program in Pennsylvania are reported.
     The information support system (ISS), developed to assist
     regional medical programs (RMP&#39;s) in their program planning
     and review activities, is based on a conceptual view of the
     RMP as a facilitator of change. It is a short-term evaluative
     technique and encompasses three major premises: (1) change
     should occur where problems exist in the health care system;
     (2) change should involve problems with which providers and
     the public have a mutual concern; and (3) RMP&#39;s are most likely
     to be successful in facilitating change in those situations
     where actual health care needs coincide with needs for change.
     Respondents who evaluated the ISS in the Susquehanna Valley
     Regional Medical Program identified nine health care problems
     or issues: physician shortage and maldistribution, inadequate
     third-part payment mechanisms, need for primary care services,
     need for consumer education, need for coordinated planning
     of facilities and services, criticisms of comprehensive
     health planning, shortage of nursing homes and poor quality
     of care, problems related to paramedical personnel, and need
     for an emergency medical services system. The Susquehanna
     Valley Regional Medical Program is detailed in terms of program
     activities developed to meet health care problems and issues.

TI:  Problem-oriented assessment of the Nassau-Suffolk Regional
     Medical Program. Rockville (MD): Health Services and Mental
     Health Administration; 1973 Mar. 74 p
AB:  The information support system (ISS) approach to assist regional
     medical programs (RMPs) in their program design and review
     is reported. The ISS approach to evaluation is problem-oriented
     and makes use of document analysis and interviews with influential
     health care leaders and with RMP staff members. Nine major
     health care problems in the Nassau and Suffolk Counties RMP
     in New York are examined: (1) the lack of coordination in the
     planning and delivery of health care; (2) the high cost of health
     care; (3) the need for primary care facilities and services;
     (4) inadequate quality of care; (5) inadequate transportation
     to health services; (6) the shortage and maldistribution
     of primary care physicians; (7) the shortage and poor quality
     of care in nursing homes; (8) the need for consumer education;
     and (9) the need for specific health services. The general
     findings of studies of eight RMPs are presented and relate
     to the identification of problems, the degree of problem orientation,
     and the apparent degree of effectiveness of local RMPs. It
     is noted that the suggestions for program development are
     not included due to the &#39;projected phaseout&#39; of RMPs. Supporting
     graphical and tabular are provided.

     Program. 1973 Mar. Rockville (MD): Health Services and Mental
     Health Administration; 1973. 68 p. Report No.: HRP-0013694/5
AB:  Information Support System (ISS) activities in the Indiana
     Regional Medical Program (IRMP) are reported. ISS is a short-term
     problem-oriented program evaluation technique designed
     to assist regional medical programs (RMPs) in their program
     planning and review. This technique is based on a conceptual
     model of the RMP as a facilitator of change and attempts to help
     RMPs decide which changes should be fostered. The assessment
     indicates: (1) a significant contribution to the improvement
     of the distribution and utilization of physicians and to the
     development of paramedical personnel; (2) a limited response
     to the need for consumer education; (3) little involvement
     in the resolution of transportation problems; (4) a substantial
     contribution to improved coordination of health planning;
     (5) strong support of paramedical personnel in the Family
     Nurse Practitioner program, but an apparent need to address
     licensure and certification problems; (6) no program activity
     in the treatment of alcohol and drug abuse; (7) substantial
     improvement of communication and coordination among health
     care agencies; (8) no involvement in the development of more
     effective third-party payment mechanisms; (9) an outstanding
     effort toward a coordinated emergency medical system; (10)
     the development of home care services in Indianapolis, but
     no need for similar efforts in rural Indiana; (11) little activity
     to rectify the shortage of nursing and allied health personnel;
     and (12) no direct involvement with CHP (comprehensive health
     planning) problems.

     Regional Medical Program.  1973 Mar. Nashville: Tennessee
     Mid-South Regional Medical Program; 1973. 68 p. Report No.:
     PC A04/MF A01
AB:  A summary of the Tennessee Mid-South Regional Medical Program
     information support system is presented. This short-term
     program evaluation technique is based on a conceptual model
     of the regional medical program as a facilitator of change
     and attempts to help such programs decide what kinds of change
     they should foster. The information support system approach
     to this decisionmaking and evaluative process is problem-oriented
     and incorporates the opinions of leaders within the regional
     health care system. This approach is generated by three premises:
     (1) changes should occur where problems exist in the health
     care system; (2) changes should occur around problems with
     which providers and the public have a manifest concern; and
     (3) regional medical programs are most likely to be successful
     in facilitating changes when real health care needs coincide
     with needs for changes. Using this conceptual model, the information
     support system assesses the effectiveness of a regional medical
     program in terms of the extent to which its program is designed
     to promote regional cooperative efforts to solve those problems
     of major concern to leaders within the health care delivery
     system. Seven major health care problems in the region are
     identified: lack of coordination within the health care system,
     inadequate access to care, hospital problems, manpower shortage
     and maldistribution, lack of health care for indigents, need
     for consumer education, and inadequacy of emergency services.

TI:  Problem-oriented assessment of the Lakes Area Regional Medical
     Program. 1973 Mar. Rockville (MD): Health Services and Mental
     Health Administration; 1973 69 p
AB:  Information Support System (ISS) project activities in the
     Lakes Area Regional Medical Program (LARMP) in western New
     York are reported. ISS is a short-term program evaluation
     technique designed to assist regional medical programs (RMPs)
     in their program planning and review. RMPs are most likely
     to succeed in facilitating change in situations where real
     health care needs coincide with needs for change as perceived
     by and wanted by leaders of influence within the health care
     system. The procedures of ISS evaluation comprise document
     analysis and interviews with health care leaders and the RMP
     staff members. The evaluation summary reveals: (1) a need
     in the Lakes area for better communication among health care
     providers and the promotion of that communication by LARMP&#39;s
     workshops and liaison activities; (2) no endeavors in health
     care cost control, insurance, or prepayment mechanisms;
     (3) a weak response to the urban ambulatory care crisis, but
     excellent program development in rural areas; (4) no visible
     involvement in alleviating the shortage of nursing homes,
     extended care facilities, and alternative housing for the
     elderly; (5) a concern with increasing the supply of health
     professionals, but a need to address the issue of the licensure
     of physician&#39;s assistants; and (6) criticisms resulting
     from the lack of communication and joint planning. It is concluded
     that the LARMP needs to strengthen its involvement with provider
     agencies and institutions.

     Birmingham: Alabama Regional Medical Program; 1970 Jun 15.
     100 p
AB:  Results of a survey of 11 institutions providing megavoltage
     radiation therapy services in Alabama are presented which
     indicate that a regional radiation therapy support and communications
     system would be useful, accepted and feasible. The suggested
     system would provide two services: assistance with treatment
     planning through computerized dosimetry, and a service to
     conduct routine calibration and checking of radiotherapy
     equipment. The system would provide dosimetry accuracy of
     plus or minus 3 percent and would be designed for future extension
     to other specialities in cancer (surgery, medical oncology)
     as well as to other categorical ailments such as heart, kidney,
     and stroke. Analysis of such a system shows it would be self-supporting
     in approximately three years. Recommendations are made for
     the proposed organization and staffing of the system, and
     components including software of such a dosimetry network.
     An estimate of start up and operational costs is presented
     in tabular format. The provision of suitable funding for Task
     II of the project is discussed; Task II would include the development
     of a systems analysis report furnishing operational details
     and design criteria necessary for the development and implementation
     of the system. Information on the role of accurate dosimetry
     in the rationale of radiation therapy, survey results, and
     samples of available equipment for use in the network, plus
     computerized dosimetry programs for regional networks is
     included in four appendices. References are listed. Portions
     of this document are not fully legible. Also sponsored by the
     Alabama State Department of Public Health, Comprehensive

     health program to serve a seven county area. Vicksburg (MS):
     Mercy Regional Medical Center; 1975. 63 p
AB:  Also sponsored by the Mississippi Regional Medical Program.
     The feasibility of establishing a coordinated, hospital-based
     home health care agency in a seven-county area of west central
     Mississippi is explored. Data on the Vicksburg area&#39;s population
     and resources were gathered and analyzed; surveys were conducted
     to assess the attitudes of local physicians and other providers;
     and the services, utilization, personnel, and problems of
     existing home care programs in the area were assessed. Findings
     are presented on the demographic characteristics of the area,
     personnel resources, attitudes of providers, home health
     resources, legal requirements, and financial considerations.
     It is concluded that three of the counties would not benefit
     significantly from the proposed agency, two would benefit
     only through the addition of physical therapy services to
     existing home health programs, and two would derive significant
     benefits from the agency. Supplies of nursing and other personnel
     required for the agency are judged to be adequate. Favorable
     attitudes expressed by public health officials suggest that
     the agency will be able to obtain a certificate of need. The
     hiring of a resourceful nurse supervisor who will be able to
     build upon the basic interest expressed by physicians is strongly
     recommended. Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement systems
     are found to be adequate mechanisms for removing financial
     barriers to participation in the program. The area&#39;s regional
     medical center demonstrates sufficient resources and interest
     to support the hospital-based agency. Tabular data are included.

     study of Northeast Central Nebraska. Final report. Columbus

AB:  Also sponsored by the Nebraska Regional Medical Program.
     This study sought to determine the extent of existing in-service
     education programs in health care available in northeast
     central Nebraska and to determine if there was a need for a Community
     Health Education Consortium (CHEC). Two questionnaires
     were developed for the study and were mailed to hospitals and
     nursing homes in a 22 county area; 86% (22) of the hospitals
     and 60% (28) of the nursing homes surveyed responded. Information
     was gathered on hospital/nursing home facilities, patient
     flow, backgrounds and responsibilities of administrators
     and nursing directors, numbers of specified professional
     and non-professional personnel, current in-service education
     activities, and in-service education needs. It was concluded
     that there was a substantial need for a CHEC that would organize
     and strengthen available educational offerings. Although
     hospital and nursing home expansion were projected to be minimal
     in the future, licensing requirements, retirements, promotions,
     and turnover were anticipated to result in continuing demand
     for relevant educational programming in the health care area.
     Survey instruments and related feasibility study materials
     are appended. (Author/JDS).

AB:  Project developed by Health Specialist Training Program
     of the Utah Migrant Council.  Also sponsored by the Intermountain
     Regional Medical Program.  The project involved 14 trainees
     who were employed by the Utah Migrant Council prior to their
     training with 8 trainers. Pre-determined by the basic job
     descriptions for the Health Specialist, the objectives dealt
     with two basic factors: trainee knowledge and trainee skills
     in performing specific tasks. Areas covered by the objectives
     were infection; the respiratory, circulatory, and digestive
     systems; nutrition; ear; pregnancy; labor and delivery;
     post partum; teeth; child development; illness in children;
     migrant environment; and health education. Classroom instruction,
     review sessions, consultant presentations, individual
     and small group instruction, role playing, case studies,
     and hands-on personal practice by the trainees were used in
     the training. Daily evaluations were conducted to provide
     the trainers constant feedback on a daily basis to determine
     how the trainees were progressing. Mid-point and final evaluations
     were conducted to determine the knowledge and skill levels
     of the trainees. Daily information was obtained through review
     sessions, laboratory observations and quizzes, individualized
     oral reviews and quizzes, daily reports from the trainees
     and trainers, attendance reports, and trainer de-briefing
     sessions. Mid-point and final evaluations were obtained
     via written examinations, oral questions, laboratory applications,
     and group problem solving. Overall, both the trainees and
     the trainers felt the project had been successful. (NQ).

AB:  The Medical Library Assistance Act authorized the Regional
     Medical Library Program to improve information services
     in health fields, as well as other programs designed to help
     the health worker. Both the RLMP and the Regional Medical Program
     are based on regional cooperation to enhance the value of available
     resources, and to enable health workers away from main centers
     to use them. Services which Regional Medical  Libraries must
     supply are described. As this program develops, more than
     conventional library service will be provided. Regional
     Medical  Programs stress the continuing education of health-related
     personnel,  and their need for health information; libraries
     are necessarily involved in such programs. The regions of
     the RMP are smaller than those of the  RMLP, and the smaller regional
     focus may be an advantage. Specific examples of the coordination
     of library services and the library-oriented programs are
     given.

TI:  Continuing education practices and interests of KMA physicians.
     Lexington (KY): Kentucky University, College of Medicine;
     1977. 32 p
AB:  Also sponsored by the Ohio Valley Regional Medical Program,
     Lexington, Kentucky. In early 1972, a survey was taken of the
     continuing education attitudes, practices, and related
     needs of Kentucky physicians. A representative sample of
     305 Kentucky Medical Association (KMA) members was interviewed
     by telephone, with 86 percent giving complete responses.
     A profile of KMA physicians was developed. It was ascertained
     that there is much involvement in continuing education, although
     78 percent of the respondents found themselves unable to participate
     in formal continuing education as much as desired. There is
     a strong preference for medical-center-based programs (for
     clinical programs as opposed to medical care delivery programs)
     and for self-assessment endeavors. A suprisingly high percentage
     favor continuing education as a prerequisite to continued
     membership on hospital staff or in KMA, to specialty recertification,
     or even to relicensure. A great majority believe that physicians
     should bear the costs of their continuing education. (Author/MSE).

     Library; 1972 Jan. Report No.: 11. 13 p
AB:  A survey of 105 Kentucky and Indiana Hospitals was made to determine
     the extent and quality of library service available under
     the auspices of  the Ohio Valley Regional Medical Program.
     Summary date on the 60hospitals with libraries are reported
     here with the objective of examining the capability of these
     institutions as a group to participatein the formation of
     a biomedical communications network as proposed by  the National
     Library of Medicine. Although the data from an academic librarian&#39;s
     viewpoint indicate that few hospitals have a dependable library
     service, the more optimistic view is that a base-line has been
     established from which to make assessments in the future for
     improved hospital health science libraries. From the data
     presented many obvious technical improvements could be suggested;
     however, the more important conclusion to be reached from
     this survey is the need for establishing some value system
     on which to base priorities and to establish goals  for improvement.

     Resources Council; 1970. 64 p.
AB:  The purpose of this conference was to: (1) improve reference
     and research library resources and services within its area
     by identifying, sharing and developing such resources and
     services and (2) further inter-library cooperation, communication
     and transportation of materials within the area of the Council.
     Aware that many information needs exist in the area, the Council
     hopes to inform the people in the North Country that it is willing
     and able to assist in meeting these needs. An overview of the
     Reference and Research Resources (3R&#39;s) Program is followed
     by a presentation of the role of Xerox Corporation or University
     Microfilms in information services. A representative from
     International Business Machines discussed the use of computers
     as library tools. The library system developed at Eastman
     Kodak Company is also described. Many information systems
     now in use or being studied are briefly described including:
     (1) the Albany Regional Medical Program Consulting Group
     for Library Service, (2) the Interuniversity Communications
     Council (EDUCOM), (3) National Chemical Information System,
     (4) National Physics Information System, (5) National Mathematics

AB:  The value of South Carolina&#39;s regional medical program (RMP)
     is assessed by the South Carolina RMP coordinator who asserts
     that remedial action is needed in three areas to make the RMP
     more effective: (1) financial assistance where needed by
     individuals or families to procure services rather than to
     provide services by governmental agencies; (2) financial
     assistance to States through priority guidelines for centralized
     resources; and (3) performance deficiencies in categorically
     directed programs. The Federal role in the delivery of health
     services is reviewed. Objectives and programs of RMP&#39;s throughout
     the United States are outlined. Consideration is given to
     the concept of quality equity versus equality of low quality,
     the achievement of equity and quality at the local level, the
     need for technical assistance at the local level for planning
     and evaluation, the cooperation of RMP&#39;s with a variety of
     government agencies, and RMP&#39;s as a prototype for the decentralization
     of health programs. The accomplishments of RMP&#39;s throughout
     the United States are examined, and supporting tabular data
     are provided. The regionalization plan in South Carolina
     is cited as an example of how principles incorporated in the
     allied services concept can be applied through an RMP mechanism
     at the State level. Activities and projects of South Carolina&#39;s
     RMP are detailed. Financial information is presented on five
     major activity areas of the RMP in South Carolina: manpower,
     accessibility and availability of health care, regionalization
     of special services, quality of medical care assurance, and
     administrative costs.

AB:  Expansion of the Regional Medical Program in South Carolina
     (SCRMP) is discussed relative to health manpower development;
     primary health care development patterns; and regionalization
     of health facilities, manpower, and other resources. With
     regard to health manpower and other service deficits, it is
     apparent that distribution problems are of considerable
     magnitude. Despite the fact that the Medical University of
     South Carolina is expanding its classes in the several colleges,
     a considerable time lag will occur and additional ways must
     be developed to deal with professional manpower shortages.
     In order for an effective regional or statewide program to
     be developed, and in consideration of other program activities
     now being developed or supported by Federal appropriations,
     an overall coordinating body for the entire State should be
     developed to which the RMP can effectively relate. A program
     plan is presented which would facilitate the availability
     of health services to rural areas through regionalization
     of effort, health education for the public, and continuing
     education for, and upgrading of, various health personnel.

TI:  State and district health planning: the roles of Regional
     Medical Program, Comprehensive Health Planning and the physician
SO:  J S C Med Assoc 1970 Jun:205-21
AB:  Regional medical program (RMP) and comprehensive health
     planning (CHP) functions are examined in relation to the role
     of practicing physicians. The objective of RMP&#39;s and CHP agencies
     is to establish a framework of planning, with both private
     and public support, for coordinated and comprehensive health
     service at the local and State levels. Formula and project
     grants for assisting State planning councils and individual
     facilities within States are available through provisions
     of RMP and CHP legislation. It is noted that the American Medical
     Association has published a guide for physician participation
     in areawide health facility planning. Bylaws of the South
     Carolina RMP are outlined as they reflect the principle of
     district planning and representation. Duties of local district
     committees under the South Carolina RMP are delineated, and
     the structure of RMP districts is illustrated. Provisions
     of Circular A-95 are described as they apply to CHP agencies.
     Consideration is given to the coordination of planning in
     multijurisdictional areas and to grant-in-aid information.
     Bylaws of the South Carolina RMP are included, and members
     of the RMP&#39;s regional advisory group are listed. Projects
     funded by the South Carolina RMP and CHP agencies are described.
     The projects are concerned with heart disease, cancer, strokes,
     chronic hemodialysis, continuing education, and informational
     activities.

     (ID): Mountain States Regional Medical Program; 1973. 23
     p.
AB:  The effects of a regional approach to continuing nursing education
     in Idaho, Montana, Nevada, and Wyoming are described. The
     regional program utilizes the existing baccalaureate schools
     of nursing in each State. In addition, the program provides
     educational programs in coronary care, inhalation therapy,
     stroke rehabilitation, and cancer nursing. Frequently,
     these programs are co-sponsored with voluntary health agencies.
     Interstate and interregional activities helped to promulgate
     the expanded nursing role and ultimately the New Manpower
     Project, which was directed toward encouragement of family
     nurse practitioner - physician teams. Current continuing
     education programs deal with topics such as nursing care audit,
     quality of care mechanisms, and patient care appraisal. A
     detailed report of continuing nursing education activities
     within each State, including tables showing the number of
     participants in each program described, is presented.

TI:  Nebraska Regional Medical Program: state plan for Community
     Health Education Consortia (CHEC). Lincoln (NB): Nebraska-South
     Dakota Regional Medical Program; 1972. 28 p
AB:  A Community Health Education Consortium (CHEC) concept is
     proposed by the Regional Medical Programs Service (RMPS)
     to meet the educational needs of health care personnel residing
     in a state like Nebraska, in which geographic barriers hinder
     easy travel. Disadvantages of time and place are minimized
     by a CHEC, which serves as a local resource agency for the design,
     development, implementation and evaluation of education
     and training programs for health manpower residing within
     the area. Goals and objectives of a CHEC are enumerated. A potential
     CHEC program is proposed which involves establishment of
     a local programming office for planning, documentation of
     needs and phase-in planning. Responsibilities of staff and
     advisory committees are suggested, as is a planning calendar
     of activities for the period 1972-1975. The relationship
     of the CHEC concept to existing programming agencies and programs
     is explored. Procedures for evaluating the proposed plan
     are structured according to the phase of activity to be evaluated.
     The planning, development and implementation efforts of
     CHEC an the results of its individual programs will be analyzed
     according to their respective objectives. The value of CHEC
     for the Nebraska RMP lies in its identification of local health
     care education needs and its opportunity to develop a comprehensive
     continuing education program at the local level. Portions
     of this document are not fully legible. Also sponsored by the

AB:  This paper reports on a survey conducted to assist the health
     education faculty of the Nebraska Center for Health Education,
     University of Nebraska-Lincoln. The objectives of the study
     were to: (1) gather base line data on the health knowledge and
     behavior of a sample of Nebraska junior high school students;
     (2) compare Nebraska junior high school students&#39; achievement
     scores on a nationally standardized test to national norms;
     (3) compare achievement scores of students who have benefited
     from a health education experience with those who have not;
     and (4) compare achievement scores of health students taught
     by trained and untrained health teachers. Three tables giving
     the results of the survey are included. Table one gives the
     comparison of Nebraska scores and national norms. Table two
     offers an analysis of student performance in selected health
     education content areas by educational experience. Table
     three presents the students&#39; mean scores as related to the
     training background of their teachers. (JD).

     Nursing Dial Access, a taped library available by telephone
     to professional nurses in Wisconsin, was developed by the
     Department of Nursing Health Sciences Unit, University Extension,
     at the University of Wisconsin, under a grant from the Wisconsin
     Regional Medical Program. The program, available on an around-the-clock
     basis, provides short tapes on a variety of nursing and medical
     subjects and may be used from any telephone, free of charge
     to Wisconsin callers. The library presents core information
     in the categories: nursing care emergency situations; new
     procedures and equipment; recent developments in nursing;
     and legal aspects in nursing. Nursing Dial Access averages
     1,000 calls a month. A survey of the users indicated that: the
     program has been found to be an appropriate way to provide certain
     types of information; nurses have accepted this information
     retrieval system; and the program has been successful in meeting
     its purpose--to assist nurses outside the metropolitan areas
     of the state. (Appendixes include a bibliography of tapes,
     guidelines for developing dial access libraries, and lists
     of tapes available to states other than Wisconsin. (PT).

AB:  Increasing emphasis within the medical profession on the
     need for current awareness has prompted the development of
     computer-basedbiomedical information systems. The Fact
     Bank Project of the MissouriRegional Medical Program is an
     effort to provide rapid access to biomedical medical information
     from remote terminals. This paper  describes and discusses
     the conceptual and structural aspects of onecomponent of
     the Fact Bank which serves as a document management tool, and
     information and/or document retrieval system, and an information
     network interacting program. This component, MEDIAN, serves
     as acomputer-based link between expanded CONSIDER, an interactive
     computer program being developed within the University of
     Missouri  Medical School&#39;s Computer Medicine Program, and
     other components of the Fact Bank such as microform resources
     and devices, reprographic facilities and audio tapes. The
     power of MEDIAN is in its programmed ability tomobilize numerous

     in the United States and a study of their applicability to the
     Washington metropolitan area. The national overview includes
     information gathered from fourteen respondents to questionnaires
     sent to 30 physician assistant programs currently in operational
     or planning stages. Aspects discussed from these data and
     from a review of the literature include the existing need,
     recruiting, placement, employment, mobility, legal aspects,
     admission requirements, evaluation, and task analysis.
     In exploring the applicability of the physician&#39;s assistant
     program to the metropolitan Washington areas the existing
     need is discussed in terms of a health care crisis. Statistical
     tables provide data on various mortality rates of the District
     of Columbia and other cities, physician distribution, and
     projection of paramedical personnel needs in Washington
     area hospitals. Other topics discussed regarding the program
     in the Washington area include the tasks of the physician&#39;s
     assistant, recruits, education and training, patient acceptance,
     and legal aspects. Recommendations and conclusions are drawn.
     The appendix presents a summary of the data received from the
     responding physicians&#39; assistant program. A 44-item list

     (1) Introduction (&#34;The objective of this Conference was to
     get the providers together with the consumers to discuss problems
     of health services in rural Nevada and to set some priorities
     in what can be done to get better health services to these areas.
     &#34;); (2) Speech by Governor O&#39;Callaghan, Keynote Speaker (emphasis
     on local accountability and the conflicts which exist between
     providers and consumers as perceived in transactional analysis
     terms); (3) &#34;Getting Physicians to Rural Areas&#34; (presents
     characteristics describing the rural physician and the rationale
     cited by physicians who leave rural areas); (4) &#34;Consumer

TI:  Proposal to Connecticut Regional Medical Program for a coordinated
     approach to health resources planning. New Haven: South Central
     Connecticut Comprehensive Health Planning, Inc.; 1974.
     19 p.
AB:  A 1974 proposal submitted to the Connecticut Regional Medical
     Program (CRMP) by a consortium of five federally funded and
     operating 314(b) agencies in the State is presented. The proposal
     involves CRMP funding of services to permit the 314(b) agencies,
     CRMP, and the Connecticut Commission on Hospitals and Health
     Care (CHHC) to cooperate in preparation for an expected transition
     to a more consolidated type of health resource planning agency.
     The proposal&#39;s importance is considered to involve its plans
     for close collaboration with CRMP and CHHC so that comprehensive
     health planning&#39;s unique consumer orientation and local
     government participation will be made available and thus
     permit statewide decisions to be made with full consideration
     of input from people affected by those decisions. The five
     314(b) comprehensive health planning agencies involved
     in the proposal are the Capitol - Central Connecticut Health
     Planning Council, the Comprehensive Health Planning Council
     of Eastern Fairfield County, the Health and Mental Health
     Planning Council of the Central Naugatuck Valley, the Midstate
     Connecticut River Estuary Comprehensive Health Planning
     Council Inc., and the South Central Connecticut Comprehensive
     Health Planning Inc. A general outline of the proposal discusses
     the need for a comprehensive health care planning program,
     prior planning and program activity, the plan of action and
     program strategy, plans for promoting organized arrangements,
     potential contributions for guiding State health policy
     developments, a plan for assessing program progress and benefits,
     and a plan for continuing the program. A contractual period
     outline is also presented.

     (from medical and other related occupational fields) who
     met to define the role of the consumer in the improvement of
     the quality of his own health care, lists of positive directives
     for consumer action are presented under each of the following
     categories: access to health care, compliance with health
     care instruction, continuity of health care, and the outcomes
     of health care. A second set of lists focuses on the role of the
     consumer in overcoming barriers to quality health care, barriers
     relating to communications, cultural patterns, and cost.
     The appendixes, covering a major portion of the document,

AB:  A proposal for a regional library network to provide comprehensive
     medical information services for patient care is described
     in an application for an operational grant from the New Jersey
     Regional Medical Program (RMP). The objectives of the project
     are: (1) to link medical libraries of the community hospitals
     and medical schools with regional (New York and Philadelphia)
     and national information resources; (2) to establish guidelines
     for improving hospital library services by assessing such
     services in nine hospitals; (3) to increase the capabilities
     of hospital library personnel through two training programs;
     (4) to encourage physicians in these hospitals to use and evaluate
     a bibliography service of the New Jersey College of Medicine
     and Dentistry library; (5) to increase utilization of the
     existing &#39;dial access&#39; information system; (6) to establish
     such a system for allied health personnel; (7) to provide a
     quarterly newsletter for hospital librarians; (8) to conduct
     an annual workshop for all medical librarians in the region;
     and (9) to expand use of document services available to community
     hospital librarians. The proposal presents a budget for the
     project, specifies personnel requirements, discusses the
     relationship of the project to the goals and activities of
     the RMP, and describes the activities designed to accomplish
     each of the project&#39;s stated objectives. Plans for evaluating
     the project also are noted.

     Regional Medical Program; 1973. 49 p. (Physician manpower
     in Florida series. 1)
AB:  At the request of the Community Hospital Education Council
     of Florida, this study was performed to assist the Council
     in its function of helping to provide a continuing supply of
     highly trained physicians, in the appropriate specialities,
     in the communities where they are needed. The objective of
     the study was to conduct an accurate inventory, by specialty,
     of physicians in active practice in Florida and to identify
     gaps in the supply and distribution of physicians. The inventory
     was compared first with the physician staffing patterns of
     several major group health plans, ratios that have frequently
     been used for comparison with the number of practitioners
     in certain populations. This comparison developed an &#34;excess&#34;
     of physicians in primary care and in most specialities for
     the state. Such a finding is markedly inconsistent with the
     availability of physicians that actually pertains in Florida
     today. Under the conclusion that the group health plan ratios
     do not apply to the system by which health care and physicians&#39;
     services are delivered to Floridians at this time, the author
     of this report has developed a set of recommended baseline
     physician ratios and has compared the inventory with those.
     Related tables are included in the appendices. (Author).

     an assessment. 1973 Nov. Rockville (MD): Regional Medical
     Programs Service; 1973. 71 p
AB:  The experience of the Regional Medical Program (RMP) with
     urban health problems is documented and assessed in a report
     based on site visits to 12 regions and a review of legislation,
     journal articles, and other materials pertaining to the program.
     The report opens with reflections on the information and data
     gathered, together with conclusions drawn from the data.
     Major historical forces that shaped the response of Congress
     and the Executive Branch to social problems in the 1960&#39;s are
     reviewed, and key programs and agencies of the 1960&#39;s are described
     to convey the environment within which the RMP was established.
     An indepth historical survey of the RMP is presented, beginning
     with an analysis of the original enabling legislation and
     of several statutory extensions. Activities of all of the
     regions, especially as they relate to the development of medical
     care services in medically underserved areas, are reviewed.
     Information gathered by Urban Health Task Force members during
     their site visits is presented and assessed. The experience
     of the RMP in all regions is said to support the conclusion that
     the greatest and most universally expressed need among the
     disadvantaged in both urban and rural areas is for comprehensive
     primary medical care. It is observed that many RMP&#39;s have assisted
     communities in developing high-quality ambulatory health
     services, usually by building upon and expanding existing
     services and facilities. Methodology used in the assessment
     is described in the appendix.

AB:  Also sponsored by the New Mexico Regional Medical Program,
     Albuquerque.  Project objectives were to train 10 nurses from
     hospitals in tCorners Area in rural critical care nursing,
     to have a training director organize and coordinate the project,
     and to utilize the replacement nurse concept. The course curriculum
     was determined through a needs assessment survey conducted
     by a team of health professionals from Arizona universities,
     and on-site clinical visits made to participating hospitals
     to discuss curriculum content with the nursing director and
     prospective trainee. Eleven nurses (9 RNs and 2 LPNs) took
     the 2-week course in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Ten were replaced
     by project-hired nurses. Since the eleventh nurse was the
     nursing director from Zuni, no replacement was hired. Six
     nurses were Navajo, one was a Pueblo Indian, and four were Anglo.
     Two groups of five nurses each attended the course on alternating
     weeks. Subjective and objective evaluations were conducted
     through pre- and posttests, and questionnaires given to the

     and the replacement nurses. After the course was completed,
     the training director, replacement nurses, nursing directors,

AB:  Preceding the body of the report, a brief review of the literature
     is provided to acquaint the reader with similarities and differences
     between national and local trends regarding the demographic
     characteristics of the physician population. The goal of
     the statewide residency study was to develop a strategy for
     the design and allocation of physician residencies consistent
     with statewide needs. A graphic model of the physician manpower
     production process was developed which enhanced understanding
     of the manpower problems facing Louisiana. Through the model,
     available data, and personal interviews with senior medical
     students and postgraduate trainees, data were compiled and
     analyzed regarding the need for physicians in Louisiana in
     1982, where and how the number of physicians can be increased,
     the status of primary care treatment, likely sites for practicing
     physicians, and related concerns. The general conclusions
     point to several significant manpower production problems
     in Louisiana in its preparation for future needs for physician
     services. The study committee proposed several recommendations
     to meet the problem. (Appendixes contain supplementary tables
     and interview forms. ) (AG).

     was developed to link the medical resources and to make them
     available to health-related personnel throughout Kansas.
     Library offices have been established at the Central Kansas
     Medical Center, Great Bend, Stormont Medical Library, Topeka,
     and at the Wichita State University, Wichita. The main office,
     located at the Clendening Medical Library, University ofKansas
     Medical Center, Kansas City, provides medical library services
     to those three offices, the other medical libraries in Kansas,
     and to the  health professionals in the state who do not have
     medical library  resources available. Reference requests
     are accepted via a twenty-four-hour telephone service from
     medical librarians and from individual health professionals.

AB:  In its February 1969 meeting, the National Advisory Council
     for Regional Medical Programs reaffirmed its position on
     recruitment and basic education--that Regional Medical
     Program funding is not to be used to replace existing sources
     of support and that other sources should be explored first.
     Therefore the Continuing Education and Training Branch of
     the Allied Health Section prepared this listing of resources
     for allied health education programs. Federal programs described
     include those of: (1) The Department of Health, Education,
     and Welfare, covering the National Institutes of Health,
     the Health Services and Mental Health Administration, Consumer
     Protection and Environmental Control, Social and Rehabilitation
     Service, and the Office of Education; (2) the Department of
     Labor; (3) the Department of Commerce; and (4) the Office of
     Economic Opportunity. The programs of 13 non-federal organizations
     are described, including information facilitating contact.
     Programs are indexed according to level of training and profession.
     Appended are listings of practitioner associations; regional
     offices of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare,
     the Department of Labor, and the Office of Economic Opportunity;
     State agencies for vocational rehabilitation and State official
     responsible for supervision of health occupations education.

AB:  The development of Regional Medical Program legislation
     is summarized and the activities of the new Division of Regional
     Medical Programs of the National Institutes of Health are
     described. The first grants for regional medical programs
     were activated 1 July 1966, and as of 30 June 1967, forty-nine
     had been awarded out of a possible total of fifty-five. The
     importance of excellent medical library facilities within
     each region, especially in all major teaching hospitals,
     with extensions down to the level of the community hospitals,
     was emphasized, and the concept of the community hospital
     as a learning center utilizing the most modern library concepts
     and teaching devices was commended. The Medical Library Association
     was asked whether training programs were being developed
     which would produce the numbers of personnel needed to staff
     the increased number of medical libraries of the future and
     whether new training programs were needed for service at the
     community hospital level.

     are outlined. Program accomplishments in the area of primary
     care, preventive care, renal disease, and emergency medical
     services are reviewed. Ambulatory care has been designated
     as the area&#39;s top priority; insufficient manpower represents
     an additional major area of concern. A plan for collecting
     and tabulating primary health care data is described, as are
     programs directed at detection and treatment of hypertension
     on an ambulatory basis, education of school children regarding
     smoking and drug abuse, and other programs. A policy change
     is noted under which fiscal fees no longer are payed to project
     sponsors and all projects are administered directly through
     the Regional Medical Program staff. This change resulted
     in a savings of $60,000 during the year. A financial report
     is presented, together with a list of currently funded projects.
     Regional Medical Program publications also are listed.

AB:  The TRMP (Texas Regional Medical Physicists) Program formally
     began in 1968 as an organization of Texas medical physicists
     with the support of the Regional Medical Program in Texas.
     TRMP was formed to help its member physicists extend and improve
     their services to the medical profession. This is accomplished
     by offering services to the members that they do not have available
     as individuals and by serving as a means of communication and
     cooperation between the members. Services provided by the
     TRMP central office include dosimetry calculations by computer,
     mailed thermoluminescent dosemeters to check machine output,
     mailed films to check light localizers, loan of equipment
     and information services. In addition, a physicist is available
     for on-site review of dosimetry procedures at a member&#39;s institution.
     The TRMP services are available only to physicists and TRMP
     employees are not permitted to do private consulting; therefore,
     there is no interference with established relationships
     between members and the radiotherapy community.

     42 p.
AB:  An organizational plan for consumer health education activities
     of the New Mexico Regional Medical Programs&#39; Health Education
     Group (HEG) is presented. Health education is defined, and
     the purpose, organization, and planning base of the HEG are
     described. Long-term organizational goals are set forth,
     and the consumer role in the health care delivery system is
     discussed. Goals related to the development of a total health
     resource network in New Mexico are stated, and future orientation
     guidelines (the need for ongoing research by the health care
     delivery system) are presented. A process for developing
     health education materials, including dissemination of
     the final product, is outlined. Steps in planning for health
     education, drawn from World Health Organization materials,
     are outlined as follows: collecting information essential
     for planning; establishing objectives defined as short-range
     and long-range goals; assessing the barriers to health education
     and how these barriers may be overcome; appraising apparent
     and potential resources, e.g., organizations, personnel,
     materials, and funds; and developing the detailed plan of
     operations. A discussion of the concept of illness/wellness
     in health education is included. This concept is said to offer
     a complete range of possibilities for interpreting an individual&#39;s
     state or level of health, thereby providing the health educator
     with a clue as to how educational methodology might best be
     oriented with reference to a persons&#39;s health status. The
     cycle of life concept is presented as a framework for HEG planning.
     Based on the prioritizations given to various categories
     as they relate to stages of life, the Group is provided with
     topics from which media presentations can be developed. These
     topical areas include nutrition, physical development,
     environment, psychological development, safety, and illness
     / wellness; life stages are identified as infancy, early childhood,
     school age, teen years, early adulthood, middle age, and geriatrics.

TI:  Alabama Regional Medical Program family practice residency
     feasibility study. Final Report. 1974 Sep 30. Birmingham:
     Alabama Regional Medical Program; 1974. 144 p
AB:  The need for additional family physicians in Alabama is documented,
     and the establishment of family practice residencies in nine
     communities is proposed. A statistical evaluation of the
     American Medical Association&#39;s Physician Master Record
     (June 1974) shows a ratio of family practice / general practice
     (FP / GP) physicians to population of 1:5, 198 for Alabama,
     or more than twice the ratio recommended by the American Academy
     of Family Practice. The immediate addition of a minimum of
     746 FP / GP physicians is required to achieve the recommended
     ratio. Currently, two family practice residency programs
     exist in the State, each authorized for 24 residents. Maldistribution
     of FP / GP physicians is an additional problem. It is also noted
     that older FP / GP physicians far outnumber younger practitioners.
     A projection of need for family practice physicians is made
     for each planning district in the State. The nine communities
     proposed as sited for a Statewide network of family practice
     residencies have hospital facilities and medical staff capable
     of meeting the educational requirements of the Residency
     Review Committee for Family Practice. These communities
     also have indicated a level of interest appropriate for program
     development. A budget for funding residencies at their sites
     is estimated, and potential sources of funds are suggested.
     The mechanism by which the residencies will operate as an integrated
     system rather than as a loose confederation of autonomous
     programs is outlined. Appendices include a list of participants
     in a planning conference; an outline of steps in establishing
     a family practice residency; the methodology used to determine
     physician need; unit cost estimates; a map showing family
     practice residency programs in the United States; and other
     supporting documents. Nine tables and a three-page bibliography
     also are included. Port of this document are not fully legible.

     needs for allied health professionals. A final report to the
     Alabama Regional Medical Program. 1970 Aug 31. Birmingham:
     Alabama Regional Medical Program; 1970. 49 p
AB:  Proceedings of a conference held on June 25, 1970, to discuss
     status of and need for continuing education programs for allied
     health professionals in Alabama are presented. It was found
     that such programs vary from none at all to &#39;fairly good, but
     inadequately financed&#39; at the State level; programs established
     by national organizations present problems of high cost and
     job time lost for attendance. Needs for establishing and strengthening
     programs appear to be in the following order of urgency: physical
     therapists, radiologic technologists, medical record librarians,
     nurse anesthetists, nurses, pharmacists, and medical technologists.
     It is suggested that the various professional organizations
     join forces under the direction of an administrator affiliated
     with a State university to organize and publicize continuing
     education programs throughout the State. Specific topic
     discussed at the conference include: the role of educational
     television in continuing education; status of and goals for
     continuing education for nurse anesthetists, medical record
     personnel, and physical therapists; continuing education
     from the viewpoint of a physician; and current and projected
     manpower requirements for allied health professions versus
     supply. Discussions with representatives of four Alabama
     professional groups concerning activities and needs for
     continuing education and extension services are summarized.

AB:  A study of nursing homes in Maine was conducted by student researchers
     during the summer, 1970, under Maine&#39;s Regional Medical Program
     (MRMP). The survey, focusing on staffing patterns and general
     needs in nursing homes in Maine, was conducted in order to determine
     ways in which MRMP might assist the nursing homes and the Maine
     Department of Health and Welfare in their efforts to provide
     the best possible patient care. The tabulation of the data
     which was collected forms the basis of the report. It was found
     that for the most part nursing homes are understaffed, particularly
     in regard to trained nurses. Recommendations are made such
     as: the standardization of state and federal requirements;
     a revision of medicare toward greater responsiveness to patient&#39;s
     needs; and a greater availability of occupation, physical,
     speech, and psychological therapists to nursing homes. (Author/WS).

TI:  Survey on continuing education needs for health professionals:
     report. Santa Monica: System Development Corporation; 1969.
     387 p
AB:  The report documents the results of a 1967 survey of health
     professionals in the four-State Western Interstate Commission
     for Higher Education (WICHE) Mountain States Regional Medical
     Program (MS/RMP). Addressed to health professionals in each
     of the four States--Idaho, Montana, Nevada, and Wyoming--the
     survey focuses primarily on the characteristics and continuing
     education needs of the Mountain State health professionals.
     The disease categories of heart disease, cancer, and stroke
     are emphasized. Part 1 reviews the major findings of the survey
     data analysis, providing summary profiles of the following
     groups: physician, dentist, hospital administrator, registered
     nurse, licensed practical nurse, medical/laboratory technologist,
     physical therapist, radiologic/X-ray technologist. Part
     2 presents the survey design and analysis plan. Part 3, making
     up the major body of the report, examines each of the professional
     groups listed above as they relate to: selected personal and
     professional characteristics, need for continuing education,
     desired methods and procedures of continuing education,
     and other factors relevant to continuing education. Statistical
     findings are discussed and tabulated. Part 4 reports the patient
     referral patterns and practices of physicians and dentists.
     Findings and conclusions are discussed along with their implications
     for immediate and long-range actions. Survey instruments
     are appended. (MW).

AB:  These proceedings consist of papers presented at the meeting,
     grouped into two subject areas: the Veterans&#39; Administration
     Library proram and the Regional Medical Program of the National
     Institutes of Health. The idea  of the successful medical library
     as a physician&#39;s laboratory is explored, referring to VA hospital
     libraries. A description of the Pilot Automated Hospital
     Information Ssystem Study (PILOT AHIS) is reviewed, while
     the forces influencing VA library services are outlined in
     an abstract of a longer paper. The role of the VA Central Office
     Library in the VA library network and a description of library
     service in the Washington VA Hospital are the other topics
     covered. The second group of papers opens with the summary
     of a review of current Medical Library Association programs,
     followed by an overview of the Regional Medical Program and
     its relation to medical library activities and a discussion
     of the role of the Medical Library Association in regional
     medical planning. The complete test of the paper on VA Library
     services is published in the January 1968 Bulletin Library
     Program, by Henry J. Gartland.

     have been identified as the primary needs in program development
     in health administration for long-term care facilities:
     defintion and scope of the field; methodology for priority
     identification; resources needed for an external degree
     program; and relationships and cooperative programming.
     These factors along with funding and implementation mechanisms
     are discussed regarding the role of Oswego College. The ultimate
     objective is to integrate an external degree program with
     a customary academic program and to bolster it through an ongoing
     continuing education program. (LBH).

SO:  Phys Med Biol 1972 Nov:878
AB:  A RAD-8 Treatment Planning System located at University Hospitals
     in Madison, Wisconsin, is currently being used to calculate
     radiotherapy isodose distributions for seven hospitals
     in the Wisconsin region. This system was purchased by Project
     6 of the Wisconsin Regional Medical Program, known as Wisconsin
     Radiological Physics Laboratory (WRPL). Interaction with
     the system is accomplished by using Xerox telecopiers. A software
     beam generation system has been developed which enhances
     the ability of this system to respond effectively to use of
     this type. Treatment beams may be defined from data collected
     by a water phantom beam scanning device which outputs data
     onto paper tape, from beam information already contained
     on the RAD-8 system tape and from /sup 60/Co treatment machine
     parameters. From a set of basic beam definitions, additional
     treatment beams may be generated as needed in a matter of a few
     minutes. At present between two and three treatment plans
     are calculated per day with response times varying between
     a few hours and one day. The overall utilization of this system
     was presented as well as the accuracy which can be expected
     for teletherapy and interstitial or intracavitary calculations
     performed.

AB:  This handbook is designed as a guide for nursing supervisors
     and hospital administrators to help them decrease unnecessary
     overlap and increase efficiency of nursing staff and related
     allied health professionals through job analysis. Three
     chapters and five appendixes are included. Chapter I deals
     with the meaning of job analysis, qualitative aspects of job
     analysis, basic structure of jobs, and uses and users of data.
     Chapter II is concerned with proper use of a job analysis, including
     definition of terms and job analysis techniques. Chapter
     III deals with the task inventory method, analysis of task
     data, and inventory administration. The appendixes provide
     more comprehensive, detailed information necessary for
     conducting a job analysis, including a systems approach to
     manpower analysis, an example of an individual job description,
     descriptions of selected CODAP programs (Comprehensive
     Occupational Data Analysis Program, a computerized occupational
     data analysis system which inputs and performs calculations
     upon raw data from job inventories), instructions for administering
     the survey, and replications of the actual task analysis form
     developed for nurses and related health care professionals.

     Medical Program (RMP) are reviewed. Difficulties in the establishment
     and effective operation of RMP&#39;s are discussed. Measures
     for the control of heart disease and cancer are examined. Treatment
     modalities for individuals with chronic respiratory diseases
     are explored. Criteria for the delivery of emergency medical
     care are outlined, and objectives of the Lakes Area RMP are
     noted. Advances made to improve the health care provided to
     rural residents are considered. Particular attention is
     given to efforts of the Lakes Area RMP with regard to hypertension,
     the reduction of mortality rates among young children and
     the elderly through the use of a traveling clinic, continuing
     education for health professionals, preventive services
     in health maintenance, the development and improvement of
     primary care services, and the integration of rehabilitation
     services into the continuum of medical service. Achievements
     of the Lakes Area RMP are cited. Staff and advisory group members
     of the program are listed.

     Milwaukee: Wisconsin Regional Medical Program; 1972. 85
     p.
AB:  An ad hoc committee approved by the Executive Committee of
     the Regional Advisory Group spent eight months in 1972 addressing
     itself to the question, &#39;Should a School of Optometry be established
     in the state of Wisconsin to deal with the overall need for eye
     and vision care in the state.&#39; Their study was designed to identify,
     through the providers of eye and vision care services, those
     services the public should expect in eye and vision care, and
     the optimum delivery of these services. The committee found
     that data on distance between practitioners, hours worked,
     visits per week, and waiting time for routine appointments
     did not indicate a significant need for more optometrists.
     Current entry levels and projected exit rates of practitioners
     did not constitute evidence that additional numbers of optometrists
     would be needed through 1985. The report surveyed the possible
     new technologies in eye care that might increase the productivity
     of eye care practitioners at some future time by as much as 50%.
     The committee, further, recommended the establishment of
     a continuing education program through the University of
     Wisconsin.

     queried only a small percentage of  Minnesota hospitals; 2)
     The program as a whole reached every hospital in Minnesota;
     3) The program made possible three years later the  establishment
     of hospital library consortia, and convinced hospital  staffs
     and administrators of the necessity of library service for
     the support of educational health care programs.
