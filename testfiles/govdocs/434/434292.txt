                                                             SERIES NOTE


                    Current Bibliographies in Medicine (CBM) is a continuation in part of the National Library of  Medicine's
                    Literature Search Series, which ceased in 1987 with No. 87-15. In 1989 it also subswned  the  Specialized
                    Bibliography Series. Each bibliography in the new series covers a distinct subject  area  of  biomedicine
                    and is intended to fulfill a current awareness function. Citations are usually derived from  searching  a
                    variety  of  online  databases.  NLM  databases  utilized  include  MEDLINI?,  AVLINE",   BIOETHICSLINE",
                    CANCERLIR,  CATLIN'E",  HEALTH,  POPLINE7  and  TOXLINF,".  The  only   criterion   for   the   inclusion
                    of a particular published work is its relevance to the topic being presented; the format,  ownership,  or
                    location of the material is not considered.

                    Comments and suggestions on this series may be addressed to:

                                                REGIONAL MEDICAL PROGRAMS


                     T'he Regional Medical Programs were first conceived  in  the  report  of  the  President's  Commission  on
                     Hew Disease, Cancer and Stroke, chaired by Dr. Michael  E.  DeBakey.  The  report,  entitled  "A  National
                     Program to Conquer Heart Disease,  Cancer,  and  Stroke"  (Dec.  1964),  recommended  the  institution  of
                     regional cooperative arrangements to make the  latest  advances  from  biomedical  research  available  to
                     benefit the health of the American people.

                     In October 1965, President Johnson  signed  the  Heart  Disease,  Cancer  and  Stroke  Amendments  (Public
                     Law 89-259)  that  authorized  the  establishment  and  maintenance  of  Regional  Medical  Programs.  The
                     purpose of this amendment to  the  Public  Health  Service  Act  was  "to  encourage  and  assist  in  the
                     establishment of regional cooperative arrangements  among  medical  schools,  research  institutions,  and
                     hospitals for  research  and  @g  (including  continuing  education)  and  for  related  demonstration  of
                     patient care..." (Sec. 900, PL 89-239).

                     Ultimately, 56 regions were established, covering the nation, including Alaska, Hawaii, and  Puerto  Rico.
                     Regions were multi-state, individual states, or portions of states; some overlapped,  depending  on  local
                     decision-making at their creation. Most programs were located  at  or  near  university  medical  schools.
                     Accomplishments in each region varied as much as the regions themselves, and  in  many  cases  were  never
                     written up and published.

                     This bibliography was prepared in support of the National Library of Medicine conference titled  "Regional
                     Medical Programs: Legislation and Activities in the U.S. (1965-1976),"  held  in  Bethesda,  Maryland,  on
                     December  6,  1991.  The  bibliography  includes  al,  items  that  could  be  identified;  citations  are
                     representative of the types of  material  written  about  the  Programs,  and  include  journal  articles,
                     monographs, meeting abstracts, reports, and dissertations from 1964 to 1977. Materials are organized  into
                     four, categories: general citations about Regional  Medical  Programs;  projects  under  Regional  Medical
                     Programs; library and information services sponsored by Regional Medical Programs; and  dial  access  tape
                     libraries supported by Regional Medical Programs. A citation may appear in more than one category.

                                                           SEARCH  STRATEGY


                      A variety of online databases are usually searched in  preparing  bibliographies  in  the  CBM  series.  To
                      assist you in updating or otherwise manipulating the material in this search, the strategy used    for  the
                      NLM's MEDLINE database is given below. Please  note  that  the  search  strategies  presented  here  differ
                      from individual demand searches in that they are generally  broadly  formulated  and  irrelevant  citations
                      edited out prior to printing.
