                     TITLE 16--COMMERCIAL PRACTICES
 
                   CHAPTER I--FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION
 
PART 23_GUIDES FOR THE JEWELRY, PRECIOUS METALS, AND PEWTER INDUSTRIES--Table 
 
Sec. 23.23  Misuse of the words ``ruby,'' ``sapphire,'' ``emerald,'' 

``topaz,'' ``stone,'' ``birthstone,'' ``gemstone,'' etc.

    (a) It is unfair or deceptive to use the unqualified words ``ruby,'' 
``sapphire,'' ``emerald,'' ``topaz,'' or the name of any other precious 
or semi-precious stone to describe any product that is not in fact a 
natural stone of the type described.
    (b) It is unfair or deceptive to use the word ``ruby,'' 
``sapphire,'' ``emerald,'' ``topaz,'' or the name of any other precious 
or semi-precious stone, or the word ``stone,'' ``birthstone,'' 
``gemstone,'' or similar term to describe a laboratory-grown, 
laboratory-created, [manufacturer name]-created, synthetic, imitation, 
or simulated stone, unless such word or name is immediately preceded 
with equal conspicuousness by the word ``laboratory-grown,'' 
``laboratory-created,'' ``[manufacturer name]-created,'' ``synthetic,'' 
or by the word ``imitation'' or ``simulated,'' so as to disclose clearly 
the nature of the product and the fact it is not a natural gemstone.

    Note to paragraph (h): The use of the word ``faux'' to describe a 
laboratory-created or imitation stone is not an adequate disclosure that 
the stone is not natural.


[[Page 153]]


    (c) It is unfair or deceptive to use the word ``laboratory-grown,'' 
``laboratory-created,'' ``[manufacturer name]-created,'' or 
``synthetic'' with the name of any natural stone to describe any 
industry product unless such industry product has essentially the same 
optical, physical, and chemical properties as the stone named.
