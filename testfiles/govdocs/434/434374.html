      <h1>Passion for Art and Science Merge in &quot;The Flowering of Florence: 
        Botanical Art for the Medici&quot; on View at the National Gallery of 
        Art <br />
      March 3 - May 27, 2002</h1>
      <hr size="1" />
      <p>Washington, DC -- The Medici family's passion for the arts and fascination 
        with the natural sciences, from the 15th century to the end of the dynasty 
        in the 18th century, is beautifully illustrated in <em>The Flowering of 
        Florence: Botanical Art for the Medici,</em> at the National Gallery of 
        Art's East Building, March 3 through May 27, 2002. Sixty-eight exquisite 
        examples of botanical art, many never before shown in the United States, 
        include paintings, works on vellum and paper, <em>pietre dure</em> (mosaics 
        of semiprecious stones), manuscripts, printed books, and sumptuous textiles. 
        The exhibition focuses on the work of three remarkable artists in Florence 
        who dedicated themselves to depicting nature--Jacopo Ligozzi (1547-1626), 
        Giovanna Garzoni (1600-1670), and Bartolomeo Bimbi (1648-1729).</p>
      <p> "The masterly technique of these remarkable artists, combined with freshness 
        and originality of style, has had a lasting influence on the art of naturalistic 
        painting," said Earl A. Powell III, director, National Gallery of Art. 
        "We are indebted to the institutions and collectors, most based in Italy, 
        who generously lent works of art to the exhibition."</p>
      <h1><strong>The Exhibition</strong></h1>
      <p> <strong>Early Nature Studies:</strong> The exhibition begins with an introductory 
        section on nature studies from the late 1400s and early 1500s. Plants 
        abound in mid-15th-century art, but portrayals were generally idealized 
        and often conveyed allegorical or symbolic meanings. Domenico Veneziano's 
        (c. 1410-1461) <em>Madonna and Child,</em> c. 1445, depicts a rosebush with 
        red and white blossoms symbolizing the Christ Child's future sacrifice 
        and Mary's purity. Other works show the continued development of botanical 
        illustration in the later 15th century, including Leonardo da Vinci's 
        (1452-1519) pen-and-ink drawing, <em>Studies of Flowers,</em> c. 1483, and 
        Perugino's (c. 1450-1523) <em>The Crucifixion with the Virgin, Saint John, 
        Saint Jerome, and Saint Mary Magdalene,</em> c. 1482-1484.</p>
      <p> <strong>Jacopo Ligozzi:</strong> The second grand duke of Tuscany, Francesco I 
        (1541-1587), invited Jacopo Ligozzi (1547-1626) to join his court. Seventeen 
        of Ligozzi's works are displayed, the largest number ever seen outside 
        of Italy. Among them are the first known drawing of a pineapple from South 
        America, the <em>American Century Plant</em> newly brought from Mexico, 
        and <em>Mourning Iris and Spanish Iris.</em> Also included is a masterpiece 
        of botanical and zoological art, Ligozzi's <em>Fig Branch with Exotic Finches,</em> 
        which shows a common fig branch on which are perched three exotic birds.</p>
      <p> <strong>Giusto Utens Lunettes:</strong> Flemish artist Giusto Utens (mid-16th 
        century -1609) was commissioned by Cosimo di Medici's son, the third grand 
        duke Ferdinando I (1549-1649), to depict the Medici villas in a series 
        of fourteen large lunettes. This unique collection of paintings, created 
        between 1598 and 1599, provides a good sense of what the villas and their 
        surrounding gardens must have looked like during the 16th century. Three 
        lunettes, <em>The Belvedere with Palazzo Pitti,</em> <em>Villa L'Ambrogiana,</em> 
        and <em>Villa Poggio,</em> can be seen in the exhibition.</p>
      <p> <strong>Daniel Froeschl:</strong> Ferdinando I had a passion for gardens and sent 
        botanists on expeditions throughout Europe. He commissioned artists to 
        illustrate the plants in his care, which he collected in large florilegia. 
        The exhibition includes one such commission, that of the German artist 
        Daniel Froeschl (1563-1613), who painted <em>Sunflower,</em> a plant that 
        was introduced to Tuscany from Peru in the 16th century. Froeschl renders 
        the sunflower twice, first in a conventional front view and then, perhaps 
        for the first time in botanical illustration, from the back.</p>
      <p> <strong>Pietre Dure:</strong> In the early years of the 17th century, Florence 
        became famous for semiprecious mosaic inlays, or <em>pietre dure.</em> A 
        selection of these colorful mosaics is presented in the exhibition, including 
        <em>Sunflower</em> (1664) by Gerolamo della Valle (17th century) and a small 
        panel by an unknown artist, <em>Parrot in a Pear Tree</em> (17th century). 
        These mosaic panels were used to decorate the fronts of elaborate cabinets, 
        and larger panels became tabletops. Examples of both are represented in 
        the exhibition.</p>
      <p> <strong>Flowers of Silk:</strong> The art of embroidery blossomed in 15th-century 
        Florence and continued to flourish for several centuries. Botanical themes 
        were uniquely suited to the decoration of rich fabrics used for ceremonial 
        occasions. Several 17th-century examples of botanical embroidery can be 
        seen in the exhibition, including a <em>Chalice Veil,</em> a <em>Baptismal 
        Cover,</em> and a <em>Chasuble for the Feast of Santa Reparata.</em></p>
      <p> <strong>Giovanna Garzoni:</strong> Under the rule of Ferdinando II (1610-1670), 
        still-life painting grew very popular. Giovanna Garzoni (1600-1670)--one 
        of the most important female artists in the history of Italian art--gained 
        great fame for her naturalistic paintings. Sixteen of Garzoni's works 
        can be seen in the exhibition including two of her many still lifes depicting 
        extravagant bouquets of cultivated flowers, both titled <em>Glass Vase 
        with Flowers.</em> Also on view are several still lifes of fruits and vegetables, 
        such as <em>Chinese Plate with Cherries and Bean Pods,</em> c. 1620, a favorite 
        subject of Garzoni. <em>Three Lemons with a Bumblebee,</em> which portrays 
        two lemon branches bearing fruit and an animated bumblebee hovering above, 
        is another delightful example of Garzoni's work. Several of the Garzoni 
        paintings have never before been exhibited in public. </p>
      <p> <strong>Bartolomeo Bimbi:</strong> Cosimo III (1642-1723), the sixth grand duke, 
        continuing the Medici tradition of patronage for the arts and sciences, 
        lent considerable support to the painter Bartolomeo Bimbi (1648-1729). 
        Bimbi specialized in "portraits from nature," often large-scale scenes 
        of monstrous and odd specimens of fruits and vegetables that grew in the 
        gardens of the Medici villas. The exhibition includes Bimbi's <em>Citrus 
        Fruits,</em> which depicts 34 varieties of citrus, and <em>Pears,</em> 1699, 
        which shows 115 different types of pears. Both are examples of "inventories" 
        painted for Cosimo III. Among the horticultural "monstrosities" painted 
        by Bimbi are a <em>Monstrous Cauliflower and Horseradish,</em> 1706, and 
        a life-size <em>Sunflower,</em>1721.</p>
      <h1><strong>Curators, Catalogue and Related Activities</strong></h1>
