    metal.  Except where the context otherwise requires, the expression also covers base metal
    inlaid with precious metal.

8.  Subject to note 1(a) to Section VI, goods answering to a description in heading 7112 are

Statistical Note

1.  For the purposes of subchapter II, unless the context otherwise requires:

       blocks, lumps, billets, cakes, slabs, pigs, cathodes, anodes, briquettes, cubes, sticks,
       grains, sponge, pellets, shot, and similar manufactured primary forms, but does not
       cover rolled, forged, drawn, or extruded products, tubular products or cast or
       sintered forms which have been machined or processed otherwise than by simple
       trimming, scalping or descaling;

  (b). The term "semimanufactured" refers to wrought metal products in the form of bars,
       rods, sections, plates, sheets, strips, wire, tubes, pipes, and hollow bars, and to
       powder (other than primary metals in powder form);

  (c).   The term "waste and scrap" refers to materials and articles of metals which are
         second-hand or waste or refuse, or are obsolete, defective, or damaged, and which
         are fit only for the recovery of the metal content or for use in the manufacture of
         chemicals, and does not include metals in unwrought form or metal-bearing
         materials provided for in heading 2616.
