as part of the building. At the option of the insured, these 
extensions and additions may be insured separately. 
Additions and extensions that are attached to and in 
contact with the building by means of a common interior 
wall that is not a solid load-bearing wall are always 
considered part of the building and cannot be insured 
separately.

Personal Property, 4. Special Limits

Coverage for fine arts, collectibles, jewelry, and furs has 
been increased to $ 2500. 

3. Section III. Property Covered, C. Coverage C -
Other Coverages, 2.a. & b.

Coverage for the two loss avoidance measures, 
(sandbagging and relocation of property to protect it from 
flood or the imminent danger of flood) has been increased 
to $1,000 for each.

4. Section IV.  Property Not Covered, 5.a. & b.

Coverage has been changed to pay for losses to self-
propelled vehicles used to service the described location 
or designed to assist handicapped persons provided that 
the vehicles are in a building at the described location.

Coverage has been clarified to pay for losses from land 
subsidence under certain circumstances.  Subsidence of 
land along a lake shore or similar body of water which 
results from the erosion or undermining of the shoreline 
caused by waves or currents of water exceeding cyclical 
levels that result in a flood is now covered. All other land 
subsidence is excluded. 

9. Section V.  Exclusions, D.4.b.(3)

Coverage is now excluded for water, moisture, mildew, or 
mold damage caused by the policyholder's failure to 
inspect and maintain the insured property after the flood 
waters recede.

10. Section V.  Exclusions, D.6.

Coverage is now added for damage from the pressure of 
water against the insured structure with the requirement 
that there be a flood in the area and the flood is the 
proximate cause of damage from the pressure of water 
against the insured structure.

11. Section V.  Exclusions, F.

An exclusion for the cost of testing for or monitoring of 
pollutants unless it is required by law or ordinance has 
been added.

subject to the appropriate waiting period (currently 30 days). 

13. Section VIII. General Conditions, V. Loss 
Settlement, 3. Special Loss Settlement, b.(1)

Coverage for a manufactured or mobile home or travel 
trailer eligible for replacement cost coverage is limited to

location for a period of 45 consecutive days 
from the date you begin to move it there. The 
personal property that is moved must be

otherwise reasonably protected from the 
elements.

Any property removed, including a moveable 
home described in Definition 6. Building, 
paragraphs b. and c., must be placed above 
ground level or outside of the special flood 
hazard area.

This coverage does not increase the Coverage A 
or Coverage B limit of liability.

D.	COVERAGE D - INCREASED COST OF 
COMPLIANCE

1. General

This policy pays you to comply with a State or local 
floodplain management law or ordinance affecting 
repair or reconstruction of a structure suffering flood 
damage. Compliance activities eligible for payment 
are: elevation, floodproofing, relocation, or demolition 
(or any combination of these activities) of your 
structure.  Eligible floodproofing activities are limited 
to:

a. Nonresidential structures.

b. Residential structures with basements that 
satisfy FEMA's standards published in the Code 
of Federal Regulations [44 CFR 60.6 (b) or 
(c)].

2. Limit of Liability

We will pay you up to $30,000 under this Coverage D 
- Increased Cost of Compliance, which only applies to 
policies with building coverage (Coverage A). Our 
payment of claims under Coverage D is in addition to 
the amount of coverage which you selected on the 
application and which appears on the Declarations 
Page. But the maximum you can collect under this 
policy for both Coverage A - Building Property and 
Coverage D - Increased Cost of Compliance cannot 
exceed the maximum permitted under the Act. We do 
not charge a separate deductible for a claim under 
Coverage D.

3. Eligibility

a.	A structure covered under Coverage A - Building 
Property sustaining a loss caused by a flood as 
defined by this policy must: 

(1)	Be a "repetitive loss structure." A repetitive 
loss structure is one that meets the following 
conditions:

(a) The structure is covered by a contract of 
flood insurance issued under the NFIP.

(b) The structure has suffered flood 
damage on two occasions during a 10-
year period which ends on the date of 
the second loss.

(c) The cost to repair the flood damage, on 
average, equaled or exceeded 25 
percent of the market value of the 
structure at the time of each flood loss.

(d) In addition to the current claim, the NFIP 
must have paid the previous qualifying 
claim, and the State or community must 
have a cumulative, substantial damage 
provision or repetitive loss provision in 
its floodplain management law or 
ordinance being enforced against the 
structure; or

(2)	Be a structure that has had flood damage in 
which the cost to repair equals or exceeds 
50 percent of the market value of the 
structure at the time of the flood. The State 
or community must have a substantial 
damage provision in its floodplain 
management law or ordinance being 
enforced against the structure. 

b.	This Coverage D pays you to comply with State 
or local floodplain management laws or 
ordinances that meet the minimum standards of 
the National Flood Insurance Program found in 
the Code of Federal Regulations at 44 CFR 60.3. 
We pay for compliance activities that exceed 
those standards under these conditions: 

(1)	3.a.(1) above.

(2)	Elevation or floodproofing in any risk zone to 
preliminary or advisory base flood 
elevations provided by FEMA which the 
State or local government has adopted and 
is enforcing for flood-damaged structures in 
such areas. (This includes compliance 
activities in B, C, X, or D zones which are 
being changed to zones with base flood 
elevations. This also includes compliance 
activities in zones where base flood 
elevations are being increased, and a flood-
damaged structure must comply with the 
higher advisory base flood elevation.) 
Increased Cost of Compliance coverage 
does not apply to situations in B, C, X, or D 
zones where the community has derived its 
own elevations and is enforcing elevation or 
floodproofing requirements for flood-
damaged structures to elevations derived 
solely by the community.

(3)	Elevation or floodproofing above the base 
flood elevation to meet State or local 
"freeboard" requirements, i.e., that a 
structure must be elevated above the base 
flood elevation.

c. Under the minimum NFIP criteria at 44 CFR 60.3 
(b)(4), States and communities must require the 
elevation or floodproofing of structures in 
unnumbered A zones to the base flood elevation 
where elevation data is obtained from a Federal, 
State, or other source. Such compliance activities 
are also eligible for Coverage D.

d. This coverage will also pay for the incremental 
cost, after demolition or relocation, of elevating or 
floodproofing a structure during its rebuilding at 
the same or another site to meet State or local 
floodplain management laws or ordinances, 
subject to Exclusion D.5.g. below.

e. This coverage will also pay to bring a flood-
damaged structure into compliance with State or 
local floodplain management laws or ordinances 
even if the structure had received a variance 
before the present loss from the applicable 
floodplain management requirements. 

4. Conditions

a. When a structure covered under Coverage A - 
Building Property sustains a loss caused by a 
flood, our payment for the loss under this 
Coverage D will be for the increased cost to 
elevate, floodproof, relocate, or demolish (or any 
combination of these activities) caused by the 
enforcement of current State or local floodplain 
management ordinances or laws. Our payment for 
eligible demolition activities will be for the cost to 
demolish and clear the site of the building debris 
or a portion thereof caused by the enforcement of 
current State or local floodplain management 
ordinances or laws. Eligible activities for the cost of 
clearing the site will include those necessary to 
discontinue utility service to the site and ensure 
proper abandonment of on-site utilities.

b. When the building is repaired or rebuilt, it must be 
intended for the same occupancy as the present 
building unless otherwise required by current 
floodplain management ordinances or laws. 

5. Exclusions

Under this Coverage D - Increased Cost of Compliance 
we will not pay for:

a.	The cost to comply with any floodplain 
management law or ordinance in communities 
participating in the Emergency Program.

b.	The cost associated with enforcement of any 
ordinance or law that requires any insured or 
others to test for, monitor, clean up, remove, 
contain, treat, detoxify or neutralize, or in any way

portion of a building demolished as a 
consequence of enforcement of any State or local 
floodplain management law or ordinance.

Coverage D:

(1) Until the building is elevated, floodproofed, 
demolished, or relocated on the same or to 
another premises; and 

(2) Unless the building is elevated, floodproofed, 
demolished, or relocated as soon as 
reasonably possible after the loss, not to 
exceed 2 years.

f.	Any code upgrade requirements, e.g., plumbing or 
electrical wiring, not specifically related to the State

floodplain management laws or ordinances. 

h.	Loss due to any ordinance or law that you were 
required to comply with before the current loss.

i.	Any rebuilding activity to standards that do not 
meet the NFIP's minimum requirements. This 
includes any situation where the insured has 
received from the State or community a variance 
in connection with the current flood loss to rebuild 
the property to an elevation below the base flood 
elevation. 

j.	Increased Cost of Compliance for a garage or 
carport. 

k.	Any structure insured under an NFIP Group 
Flood Insurance Policy.

compliance with State or local floodplain 
management ordinances or laws.

6. Other Provisions

a.	Increased Cost of Compliance coverage will not 
be included in the calculation to determine 
whether coverage meets the coinsurance

requirement for replacement cost coverage under 
VIII. General Conditions, V. Loss Settlement.

b. All other conditions and provisions of the policy 
apply.

V.  EXCLUSIONS



A.	We only pay for direct physical loss by or from

we describe in Coverage D - Increased Cost of 
Compliance; or

7.	Any other economic loss.

B.	We do not insure a loss directly or indirectly caused 
by a flood that is already in progress at the time and 
date:

1.	The policy term begins; or

2. Coverage is added at your request.

C.	We do not insure for loss to property caused directly 
by earth movement even if the earth movement is 
caused by flood. Some examples of earth movement 
that we do not cover are:

1. Earthquake;

2.	Landslide;

3.	Land subsidence;

4.	Sinkholes;

5.	Destabilization or movement of land that results from 
accumulation of water in subsurface land areas; or

pump discharge or overflow, or the seepage of water;

6.	The pressure or weight of water unless there is a 
flood in the area and the flood is the proximate 
cause of the damage from the pressure or weight of

Government, arising from or incident to the flooding of 
the land by the Federal Government, where the lease 
expressly holds the Federal Government harmless 
under flood insurance issued under any Federal 
Government program.

F.	We do not pay for the testing for or monitoring of 
pollutants unless required by law or ordinance.



VI.  DEDUCTIBLES



A. When a loss is covered under this policy, we will pay 
only that part of the loss that exceeds the applicable 
deductible amount, subject to the limit of insurance 
that applies. The deductible amount is shown on the 
Declarations Page.



However, when a building under construction, 
alteration, or repair does not have at least two rigid 
exterior walls and a fully secured roof at the time of 
loss, your deductible amount will be two times the 
deductible that would otherwise apply to a completed 
building.

B.	In each loss from flood, separate deductibles apply to 
the building and personal property insured by this 
policy.



C.	No deductible applies to:

1.	III.C.2.  Loss Avoidance Measures; or

2.	III.D.  Increased Cost of Compliance.



VII.  COINSURANCE



A.	This Coinsurance section applies only to coverage on 
the building.

B.	We will impose a penalty on loss payment unless the 
amount of insurance applicable to the damaged 
building is:

1.	At least 80 percent of its replacement cost; or

2.	The maximum amount of insurance available for that 
building under the NFIP,

whichever is less.

C.	If the actual amount of insurance on the building is 
less than the required amount in accordance with the 
terms of VII.B. above, then loss payment is 
determined as follows (subject to all other relevant 
conditions in this policy, including those pertaining to 
valuation, adjustment, settlement, and payment of 
loss):

1. 	Divide the actual amount of insurance carried on the 
building by the required amount of insurance.

2. 	Multiply the amount of loss, before application of the 
deductible, by the figure determined in C.1. above.

3.	Subtract the deductible from the figure determined in 
C.2. above.

We will pay the amount determined in C.3. above, or the 
amount of insurance carried, whichever is less. The 
amount of insurance carried, if in excess of the applicable 
maximum amount of insurance available under the NFIP, 
is reduced accordingly.

Examples

Example #1 (Inadequate Insurance)

Replacement value of the building	$250,000
Required amount of insurance	$200,000
(80% of replacement value of $250,000)
Actual amount of insurance carried	$180,000
Amount of the loss	$150,000
Deductible	$500



Step 1:	180,000 ? 200,000 = .90
	(90% of what should be carried)
Step 2:	150,000 X .90 = 135,000

Step 3:	135,000 - 500 = 134,500

We will pay no more than $134,500. The remaining 
$15,500 is not covered due to the coinsurance penalty 
($15,000) and application of the deductible ($500).

Example #2 (Adequate Insurance)

Replacement value of the building	$500,000
Required amount of insurance	$400,000
(80% of replacement value of $500,000)
Actual amount of insurance carried	$400,000
Amount of the loss	$200,000
Deductible	$500

In this example there is no coinsurance penalty, because 
the actual amount of insurance carried meets the required 
amount. We will pay no more than $199,500 ($200,000 
amount of loss minus the $500 deductible).

D.	In calculating the full replacement cost of a building:

1. The replacement cost value of any covered building 
property will be included;

2.	The replacement cost value of any building property 
not covered under this policy will not be included; 
and

3.	Only the replacement cost value of improvements 
installed by the condominium association will be 
included.













VIII.	  GENERAL CONDITIONS



A. Pairs and Sets 

In case of loss to an article that is part of a pair or set, we 
will have the option of paying you:

1. An amount equal to the cost of replacing the lost, 
damaged, or destroyed article, less depreciation; or

2. An amount that represents the fair proportion of the 
total value of the pair or set that the lost, damaged, or 
destroyed article bears to the pair or set.

B.	Concealment or Fraud and Policy Voidance

1. With respect to all insureds under this policy, this 
policy: 

a. Is void;

b. Has no legal force or effect;

c. Cannot be renewed; and

d. Cannot be replaced by a new NFIP policy;

if, before or after a loss, you or any other insured or 
your agent have at any time:

(1) Intentionally concealed or misrepresented 
any material fact or circumstance; 

(2) Engaged in fraudulent conduct; or

(3) Made false statements;

relating to this policy or any other NFIP 
insurance.

2.	This policy will be void as of the date the wrongful 
acts described in B.1. above were committed.

3.	Fines, civil penalties, and imprisonment under 
applicable Federal laws may also apply to the acts of 
fraud or concealment described above.

4.	This policy is also void for reasons other than fraud, 
misrepresentation, or wrongful act. This policy is void 
from its inception and has no legal force under the 
following conditions:

a.	If the property is located in a community that was 
not participating in the NFIP on the policy's 
inception date and did not join or reenter the 
program during the policy term and before the 
loss occurred; or

b. If the property listed on the application is 
otherwise not eligible for coverage under the 
NFIP.

C.	Other Insurance

1.	If a loss covered by this policy is also covered by 
other insurance that includes flood coverage not 
issued under the Act, we will not pay more than the 
amount of insurance that you are entitled to for lost, 
damaged, or destroyed property insured under this 
policy subject to the following: 

a. We will pay only the proportion of the loss that 
the amount of insurance that applies under this 
policy bears to the total amount of insurance 
covering the loss, unless C.1.b. or c. immediately 
below applies.

b. If the other policy has a provision stating it is 
excess insurance, this policy will be primary.

c.	This policy will be primary (but subject to its own 
deductible) up to the deductible in the other flood 
policy (except another policy as described in 
C.1.b. above). When the other deductible amount 
is reached, this policy will participate in the same 
proportion that the amount of insurance under 
this policy bears to the total amount of both 
policies, for the remainder of the loss. 

2. If there is a flood insurance policy in the name of a 
unit owner that covers the same loss as this policy, 
then this policy will be primary.

D.	Amendments, Waivers, Assignment

This policy cannot be changed nor can any of its 
provisions be waived without the express written consent 
of the Federal Insurance Administrator. No action that we 
take under the terms of this policy constitutes a waiver of 
any of our rights. You may assign this policy in writing 
when you transfer title of your property to someone else, 
except under these conditions:

1.	When this policy covers only personal property; or

2.	When this policy covers a structure during the course 
of construction.

E.	Cancellation of Policy by You

1. You may cancel this policy in accordance with the 
applicable rules and regulations of the NFIP.

2. If you cancel this policy, you may be entitled to a full 
or partial refund of premium also under the applicable 
rules and regulations of the NFIP.

F.	Nonrenewal of the Policy by Us

Your policy will not be renewed:

1.	If the community where your covered property is 
located stops participating in the NFIP; or

2.	If your building has been declared ineligible under 
Section 1316 of the Act.

G.	Reduction and Reformation of Coverage

1. If the premium we received from you was not enough 
to buy the kind and amount of coverage you 
requested, we will provide only the amount of 
coverage that can be purchased for the premium 
payment we received.

2. The policy can be reformed to increase the amount 
of coverage resulting from the reduction described in 
G.1. above to the amount you requested as follows:

a. Discovery of insufficient premium or incomplete 
rating information before a loss.

(1) If we discover before you have a flood loss 
that your premium payment was not enough 
to buy the requested amount of coverage, 
we will send you and any mortgagee or 
trustee known to us a bill for the required 
additional premium for the current policy 
term (or that portion of the current policy 
term following any endorsement changing 
the amount of coverage). If you or the 
mortgagee or trustee pay the additional 
premium within 30 days from the date of our 
bill, we will reform the policy to increase the 
amount of coverage to the originally 
requested amount effective to the beginning 
of the current policy term (or subsequent 
date of any endorsement changing the 
amount of coverage).

(2) If we determine before you have a flood loss 
that the rating information we have is 
incomplete and prevents us from calculating 
the additional premium, we will ask you to 
send the required information. You must 
submit the information within 60 days of our 
request. Once we determine the amount of 
additional premium for the current policy 
term, we will follow the procedure in 
G.2.a.(1) above.

(3) If we do not receive the additional premium 
(or additional information) by the date it is 
due, the amount of coverage can only be 
increased by endorsement subject to any 
appropriate waiting period.

b.	Discovery of insufficient premium or incomplete 
rating information after a loss.
(1) If we discover after you have a flood loss 
that your premium payment was not enough 
to buy the requested amount of coverage, 
we will send you and any mortgagee or 
trustee known to us a bill for the required 
additional premium for the current and the 
prior policy terms. If you or the mortgagee 
or trustee pay the additional premium within 
30 days from the date of our bill, we will 
reform the policy to increase the amount of 
coverage to the originally requested amount 
effective to the beginning of the prior policy 
term.

(2) If we discover after you have a flood loss 
that the rating information we have is 
incomplete and prevents us from calculating 
the additional premium, we will ask you to 
send the required information. You must 
submit the information before your claim can 
be paid.  Once we determine the amount of 
additional premium for the current and prior 
policy terms, we will follow the procedure in 
G.2.b.(1) above.

(3) If we do not receive the additional premium 
by the date it is due, your flood insurance 
claim will be settled based on the reduced 
amount of coverage. The amount of 
coverage can only be increased by 
endorsement subject to any appropriate 
waiting period.

3.	However, if we find that you or your agent 
intentionally did not tell us, or falsified, any important 
fact or circumstance or did anything fraudulent 
relating to this insurance, the provisions of Condition 
B. Concealment or Fraud and Policy Voidance apply.

H.	Policy Renewal 

1.	This policy will expire at 12:01 a.m. on the last day of 
the policy term.

2. We must receive the payment of the appropriate 
renewal premium within 30 days of the expiration 
date.

3. If we find, however, that we did not place your 
renewal notice into the U.S. Postal Service, or if we 
did mail it, we made a mistake, e.g., we used an 
incorrect, incomplete, or illegible address, which 
delayed its delivery to you before the due date for the 
renewal premium, then we will follow these 
procedures:

a.	If you or your agent notified us, not later than 1 
year after the date on which the payment of the 
renewal premium was due, of nonreceipt of a 
renewal notice before the due date for the 
renewal premium, and we determine that the 
circumstances in the preceding paragraph apply, 
we will mail a second bill providing a revised due

date, which will be 30 days after the date on 
which the bill is mailed.

b. If we do not receive the premium requested in the 
second bill by the revised due date, then we will 
not renew the policy. In that case, the policy will 
remain an expired policy as of the expiration 
date shown on the Declarations Page.

4.	In connection with the renewal of this policy, we may 
ask you during the policy term to recertify, on a 
Recertification Questionnaire that we will provide you, 
the rating information used to rate your most recent 
application for or renewal of insurance.

I.	Conditions Suspending or Restricting Insurance

We are not liable for loss that occurs while there is a hazard 
that is increased by any means within your control or 
knowledge.

J.	Requirements in Case of Loss

In case of a flood loss to insured property, you must:

5.	In completing the proof of loss, you must use your 
own judgment concerning the amount of loss and 
justify that amount.

6.	You must cooperate with the adjuster or 
representative in the investigation of the claim.

7.	The insurance adjuster whom we hire to investigate 
your claim may furnish you with a proof of loss form, 
and she or he may help you complete it.  However, 
this is a matter of courtesy only, and you must still 
send us a proof of loss within 60 days after the loss 
even if the adjuster does not furnish the form or help 
you complete it.

8.	We have not authorized the adjuster to approve or 
disapprove claims or to tell you whether we will 
approve your claim.

9.	At our option, we may accept the adjuster's report of 
the loss instead of your proof of loss. The adjuster's 
report will include information about your loss and the 
damages you sustained. You must sign the adjuster's 
report. At our option, we may require you to swear to 
the report.

K.	Our Options After a Loss

Options that we may, in our sole discretion, exercise after 
loss include the following:

1.	At such reasonable times and places that we may 
designate, you must:

a.	Show us or our representative the damaged

b. Submit to examination under oath, while not in 
the presence of another insured, and sign the

you against loss and the deed establishing 
your ownership of the insured real property;

(2)	Condominium association documents 
including the Declarations of the 
condominium, its Articles of Association or

to the damaged property if the originals are 
lost.

2.	We may request, in writing, that you furnish us with a 
complete inventory of the lost, damaged, or destroyed 
property, including:

a. Quantities and costs;

b.	Actual cash values or replacement cost 
(whichever is appropriate);

c.	Amounts of loss claimed; 

d.	Any written plans and specifications for repair of 
the damaged property that you can reasonably 
make available to us; and

e.	Evidence that prior flood damage has been 
repaired.

3. If we give you written notice within 30 days after we 
receive your signed, sworn proof of loss, we may:

a.	Repair, rebuild, or replace any part of the lost, 
damaged, or destroyed property with material or 
property of like kind and quality or its functional 
equivalent; and

b.	Take all or any part of the damaged property at

L.	No Benefit to Bailee

No person or organization, other than you, having custody 
of covered property will benefit from this insurance.

M. 	Loss Payment

1.	We will adjust all losses with you.  We will pay you 
unless some other person or entity is named in the 
policy or is legally entitled to receive payment. Loss 
will be payable 60 days after we receive your proof of

b.	Exercise your rights under this policy; or



c.	File an amended proof of loss, as long as it is 
filed within 60 days of the date of the loss.

N.	Abandonment

You may not abandon damaged or undamaged insured 
property to us.

O.	Salvage

We may permit you to keep damaged insured property 
after a loss, and we will reduce the amount of the loss 
proceeds payable to you under the policy by the value of 
the salvage.

P.	Appraisal

If you and we fail to agree on the actual cash value or, if 
applicable, replacement cost of the damaged property so 
as to determine the amount of loss, then either may 
demand an appraisal of the loss. In this event, you and we 
will each choose a competent and impartial appraiser 
within 20 days after receiving a written request from the 
other. The two appraisers will choose an umpire. If they 
cannot agree upon an umpire within 15 days, you or we 
may request that the choice be made by a judge of a court 
of record in the State where the insured property is 
located. The appraisers will separately state the actual 
cash value, the replacement cost, and the amount of loss 
to each item. If the appraisers submit a written report of an 
agreement to us, the amount agreed upon will be the 
amount of loss. If they fail to agree, they will submit their 
differences to the umpire. A decision agreed to by any two 
will set the amount of actual cash value and loss, or if it 
applies, the replacement cost and loss.

Each party will:

1.	Pay its own appraiser; and

2.	Bear the other expenses of the appraisal and umpire 
equally.

Q.	Mortgage Clause

The word "mortgagee" includes trustee.

Any loss payable under Coverage A - Building will be paid 
to any mortgagee of whom we have actual notice as well 
as any other mortgagee or loss payee determined to exist 
at the time of loss, and you, as interests appear. If more 
than one mortgagee is named, the order of payment will 
be the same as the order of precedence of the mortgages.

If we deny your claim, that denial will not apply to a valid 
claim of the mortgagee, if the mortgagee:

1. Notifies us of any change in the ownership or 
occupancy, or substantial change in risk of which the 
mortgagee is aware;

2. Pays any premium due under this policy on demand 
if you have neglected to pay the premium; and

3. Submits a signed, sworn proof of loss within 60 days 
after receiving notice from us of your failure to do so. 

All of the terms of this policy apply to the mortgagee.

The mortgagee has the right to receive loss payment even 
if the mortgagee has started foreclosure or similar action 
on the building.

If we decide to cancel or not renew this policy, it will 
continue in effect for the benefit of the mortgagee only for 
30 days after we notify the mortgagee of the cancellation 
or nonrenewal.

If we pay the mortgagee for any loss and deny payment to 
you, we are subrogated to all the rights of the mortgagee 
granted under the mortgage on the property.  Subrogation 
will not impair the right of the mortgagee to recover the full 
amount of the mortgagee's claim.

R.	Suit Against Us

You may not sue us to recover money under this policy 
unless you have complied with all the requirements of the 
policy. If you do sue, you must start the suit within 1 year 
after the date of the written denial of all or part of the 
claim, and you must file the suit in the United States 
District Court of the district in which the insured property 
was located at the time of loss. This requirement applies 
to any claim that you may have under this policy and to 
any dispute that you may have arising out of the handling 
of any claim under the policy.

S.	Subrogation

Whenever we make a payment for a loss under this 
policy, we are subrogated to your right to recover for that 
loss from any other person.  That means that your right to 
recover for a loss that was partly or totally caused by 
someone else is automatically transferred to us, to the 
extent that we have paid you for the loss. We may require 
you to acknowledge this transfer in writing.  After the loss, 
you may not give up our right to recover this money or do 
anything that would prevent us from recovering it. If you 
make any claim against any person who caused your loss 
and recover any money, you must pay us back first before 
you may keep any of that money.

T.	Continuous Lake Flooding

1.	If your insured building has been flooded by rising 
lake waters continuously for 90 days or more and it 
appears reasonably certain that a continuation of this 
flooding will result in a covered loss to the insured 
building equal to or greater than the building policy 
limits plus the deductible or the maximum payable 
under the policy for any one building loss, we will 
pay you the lesser of these two amounts without 
waiting for the further damage to occur if you sign a 
release agreeing:


a.	To make no further claim under this policy;

b.	Not to seek renewal of this policy;

c.	Not to apply for any flood insurance under the 
Act for property at the described location; and

d.	Not to seek a premium refund for current or prior 
terms.

If the policy term ends before the insured building 
has been flooded continuously for 90 days, the 
provisions of this paragraph T.1. will apply when the 
insured building suffers a covered loss before the 
policy term ends.

2.	If your insured building is subject to continuous lake 
flooding from a closed basin lake, you may elect to file 
a claim under either paragraph T.1. above or this 
paragraph T.2. (A "closed basin lake" is a natural lake 
from which water leaves primarily through evaporation 
and whose surface area now exceeds or has exceeded 
one square mile at any time in the recorded past. Most 
of the nation's closed basin lakes are in the western 
half of the United States, where annual evaporation 
exceeds annual precipitation and where lake levels and 
surface areas are subject to considerable fluctuation 
due to wide variations in the climate. These lakes may 
overtop their basins on rare occasions.) Under this 
paragraph T.2. we will pay your claim as if the building 
is a total loss even though it has not been continuously 
inundated for 90 days, subject to the following 
conditions:

a. Lake flood waters must damage or imminently 
threaten to damage your building.

b. Before approval of your claim, you must:

(1) Agree to a claim payment that reflects your 
buying back the salvage on a negotiated 
basis; and

(2) Grant the conservation easement described in 
FEMA's "Policy Guidance for Closed Basin 
Lakes," to be recorded in the office of the local 
recorder of deeds. FEMA, in consultation with 
the community in which the property is 
located, will identify on a map an area or 
areas of special consideration (ASC) in which 
there is a potential for flood damage from 
continuous lake flooding. FEMA will give the 
community the agreed-upon map showing the 
ASC. This easement will only apply to that 
portion of the property in the ASC. It will allow 
certain agricultural and recreational uses of 
the land.  The only structures that it will allow 
on any portion of the property within the ASC 
are certain simple agricultural and recreational 
structures.  If any of these allowable 
structures are insurable buildings under the 
NFIP and are insured under the

NFIP, they will not be eligible for the benefits 
of this paragraph T.2. If a U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers certified flood control project or 
otherwise certified flood control project later 
protects the property, FEMA will, upon 
request, amend the ASC to remove areas 
protected by those projects. The restrictions of 
the easement will then no longer apply to any 
portion of the property removed from the 
ASC; and

(3)	Comply with paragraphs T.1.a. through T.1.d. 
above.

c. Within 90 days of approval of your claim, you must 
move your building to a new location outside the 
ASC. FEMA will give you an additional 30 days to 
move if you show that there is sufficient reason to 
extend the time.

d. Before the final payment of your claim, you must 
acquire an elevation certificate and a floodplain 
development permit from the local floodplain 
administrator for the new location of your building.

e. Before the approval of your claim, the community 
having jurisdiction over your building must:

(1)	Adopt a permanent land use ordinance, or a 
temporary moratorium for a period not to 
exceed 6 months to be followed immediately 
by a permanent land use ordinance, that is 
consistent with the provisions specified for 
the easement required in paragraph T.2.b. 
above;

(2)	Agree to declare and report any violations of 
this ordinance to FEMA so that under Section 
1316 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 
1968, as amended, flood insurance to the 
building can be denied; and 

(3) Agree to maintain as deed-restricted, for 
purposes compatible with open space or 
agricultural or recreational use only, any 
affected property the community acquires an 
interest in. These deed restrictions must be 
consistent with the provisions of T.2.b. above, 
except that, even if a certified project protects 
the property, the land use restrictions continue 
to apply if the property was acquired under 
the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program or the 
Flood Mitigation Assistance Program. If a 
nonprofit land trust organization receives the 
property as a donation, that organization must 
maintain the property as deed-restricted, 
consistent with the provisions of paragraph 
T.2.b. above.

f. Before the approval of your claim, the affected 
State must take all action set forth in FEMA's 
"Policy Guidance for Closed Basin Lakes."



g. You must have NFIP flood insurance coverage 
continuously in effect from a date established by 
FEMA until you file a claim under this paragraph 
T.2. If a subsequent owner buys NFIP insurance 
that goes into effect within 60 days of the date of 
transfer of title, any gap in coverage during that 
60-day period will not be a violation of this 
continuous coverage requirement. For the purpose 
of honoring a claim under this paragraph T.2., we 
will not consider to be in effect any increased 
coverage that became effective after the date 
established by FEMA.  The exception to this is any 
increased coverage in the amount suggested by 
your insurer as an inflation adjustment.

h. This paragraph T.2. will be in effect for a 
community when the FEMA Regional Director for 
the affected region provides to the community, in 
writing, the following:

(1)	Confirmation that the community and the 
State are in compliance with the conditions in 
paragraphs T.2.e. and T.2.f. above; and

(2)	The date by which you must have flood 
insurance in effect.

U.	Duplicate Policies Not Allowed

1. We will not insure your property under more than one 
NFIP policy.

If we find that the duplication was not knowingly 
created, we will give you written notice. The notice will 
advise you that you may choose one of several 
options under the following procedures:

a.	If you choose to keep in effect the policy with the 
earlier effective date, you may also choose to 
add the coverage limits of the later policy to the 
limits of the earlier policy. The change will 
become effective as of the effective date of the 
later policy.

b.	If you choose to keep in effect the policy with the 
later effective date, you may also choose to add 
the coverage limits of the earlier policy to the 
limits of the later policy. The change will be 
effective as of the effective date of the later 
policy.

In either case, you must pay the pro rata premium for 
the increased coverage limits within 30 days of the 
written notice. In no event will the resulting coverage 
limits exceed the permissible limits of coverage under 
the Act or your insurable interest, whichever is less.

We will pay a refund to you, according to applicable 
NFIP rules, of the premium for the policy not being 
kept in effect.

2.	Your option under this Condition U. Duplicate Policies 
Not Allowed to elect which NFIP policy to keep in 
effect does not apply when duplicates have been 
knowingly created.  Losses occurring under such

circumstances will be adjusted according to the terms 
and conditions of the earlier policy. The policy with 
the later effective date will be canceled.

V.	Loss Settlement

1. Introduction

This policy provides three methods of settling losses: 
Replacement Cost, Special Loss Settlement, and 
Actual Cash Value. Each method is used for a 
different type of property, as explained in a.-c. below.

a.	Replacement Cost loss settlement, described in 
V.2. below, applies to buildings other than 
manufactured homes or travel trailers.

b.	Special loss settlement, described in V.3. below, 
applies to a residential condominium building 
that is a travel trailer or a manufactured home.

c.	Actual Cash Value loss settlement applies to all 
other property covered under this policy, as 
outlined in V.4. below.

2.	Replacement Cost Loss Settlement

a. We will pay to repair or replace a damaged or 
destroyed building, after application of the 
deductible and without deduction for 
depreciation, but not more than the least of the 
following amounts:

(1) The amount of insurance in this policy that 
applies to the building;

(2) The replacement cost of that part of the 
building damaged, with materials of like 
kind and quality, and for like occupancy and 
use; or

(3) The necessary amount actually spent to 
repair or replace the damaged part of the 
building for like occupancy and use.

b.	We will not be liable for any loss on a 
Replacement Cost Coverage basis unless and 
until actual repair or replacement of the damaged 
building or parts thereof is completed.

c.	If a building is rebuilt at a location other than the 
described location, we will pay no more than it 
would have cost to repair or rebuild at the 
described location, subject to all other terms of 
Replacement Cost loss settlement.

3.	Special Loss Settlement

a.	The following loss settlement conditions apply to 
a residential condominium building that is:



(1)	A manufactured home or a travel trailer, as 
defined in II.B.6.b. and c.; and

(2)	At least 16 feet wide when fully assembled 
and has an area of at least 600 square feet 
within its perimeter walls when fully 
assembled.

b.	If such a building is totally destroyed or 
damaged to such an extent that, in our judgment, 
it is not economically feasible to repair, at least to 
its predamage condition, we will, at our 
discretion, pay the least of the following amounts:

(1)	The lesser of the replacement cost of the 
manufactured home or travel trailer or 1.5 
times the actual cash value; or

(2)	The building limit of liability shown on your 
Declarations Page.

c.	If such a manufactured home or travel trailer is 
partially damaged and, in our judgment, it is 
economically feasible to repair it to its predamage 
condition, we will settle the loss according to the 
Replacement Cost loss settlement conditions in 
V.2. above.

4.	Actual Cash Value Loss Settlement

a.	The types of property noted below are subject to 
Actual Cash Value loss settlement.

(1) Personal property;

(2)	Insured property abandoned after a loss and 
that remains as debris at the described 
location;

(3)	Outside antennas and aerials, awnings, and 
other outdoor equipment;

(4) Carpeting and pads; 

(5) Appliances; and 

(6)	A manufactured or mobile home or a travel 
trailer as defined in II.B.6.b. or c. that does 
not meet the condition for Special Loss 
Settlement in V.3. above.

b.	We will pay the least of the following amounts:

(1)	The applicable amount of insurance under 
this policy;

(2)	The actual cash value (as defined in 
II.B.2.); or

(3)	The amount it would cost to repair or replace 
the property with material of like kind and 
quality within a reasonable time after the 
loss.




IX.  LIBERALIZATION CLAUSE



If we make a change that broadens your coverage under 
this edition of our policy, but does not require any 
additional premium, then that change will automatically 
apply to your insurance as of the date we implement the 
change, provided that this implementation date falls within 
60 days before, or during, the policy term stated on the 
Declarations Page. 



X.	WHAT LAW GOVERNS



This policy and all disputes arising from the handling of 
any claim under the policy are governed exclusively by 
the flood insurance regulations issued by FEMA, the 


National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended (42 
U.S.C. 4001, et seq.), and Federal common law.


____________________________________________________________________________________________________

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, we have signed this policy below and hereby enter into this Insurance Agreement.

CLAIM GUIDELINES IN CASE OF A FLOOD
_____________________________________________________________________________________

For the protection of you and your family, the following claim guidelines are provided by the National Flood 
Insurance Program (NFIP). If you are ever in doubt as to what action is needed, consult your insurance 
representative or call the NFIP toll-free at 1-800-638-6620 or on the TDD line at 1-800-447-9487.

Know your insurance representative's name and telephone number. List them here for fast reference:

Insurance Representative ________________________________

Representative's Phone Number	______________________________

? Notify us or your insurance representative, in writing, as soon as possible after the flood.

? If you report to your insurance representative, remind him or her to assign the claim to an NFIP- 
approved claims adjuster.  The NFIP pays for the services of the independent claims adjuster assigned 
to your claim.

? Determine the independent claims adjuster assigned to your claim and contact him or her if you have 
not been contacted within 24 hours after you reported the claim to your insurance representative. 

? As soon as possible, separate damaged property from undamaged property so that damage can be 
inspected and evaluated.

? Discuss with the claims adjuster any need you may have for an advance or partial payment for your 
loss.

? To help the claims adjuster, try to take photographs of the outside of the premises showing the flooding 
and the damage and photographs of the inside of the premises showing the height of the water and the 
damaged property.

? Place all account books, financial records, receipts, and other loss verification material in a safe place 
for examination and evaluation by the claims adjuster.

? Work cooperatively and promptly with the claims adjuster to determine and document all claim items. 
Be prepared to advise the claims adjuster of the cause and responsible party(ies), if the flooding 
resulted from other than natural cause.

? Make sure that the claims adjuster fully explains, and that you fully understand, all allowances and 
procedures for processing claim payments on the basis of your proof of loss. This policy requires you to 
send us detailed proof of loss within 60 days after the loss.

? Any and all coverage problems and claim allowance restrictions must be communicated directly from 
the NFIP.  Claims adjusters are not authorized to approve or deny claims; their job is to report to the 
NFIP on the elements of flood cause and damage.

At our option, we may accept an adjuster's report of the loss instead of your proof of loss.  The adjuster's report 
will include information about your loss and the damages to your insured property.  You must sign the 
adjuster's report.  At our option, we may require you to swear to the report.
