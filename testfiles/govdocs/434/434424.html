<p class="bioname"><b>NAME:</b> John Herschel Glenn, Jr. (Colonel, USMC, Ret.)<br>
  NASA Astronaut (former)</p>
<p class="biosec"><b>PERSONAL DATA:</b> Born July 18, 1921 in Cambridge, Ohio. 
  Married to the former Anna Margaret Castor of New Concord, Ohio. They have two 
  grown children and two grandchildren.</p>
<p class="biosec"><b>EDUCATION: </b> Glenn attended primary and secondary schools 
  in New Concord, Ohio. He attended Muskingum College in New Concord and received 
  a Bachelor of Science degree in Engineering. Muskingum College also awarded 
  him an honorary Doctor of Science degree in engineering. He has received honorary 
  doctoral degrees from nine colleges or universities.</p>
<p class="biosec"><b>SPECIAL HONORS:</b> Glenn has been awarded the Distinguished 
  Flying Cross on six occasions, and holds the Air Medal with 18 Clusters for 
  his service during World War II and Korea. Glenn also holds the Navy Unit Commendation 
  for service in Korea, the Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal, the American Campaign 
  Medal, the World War II Victory Medal, the China Service Medal, the National 
  Defense Service Medal, the Korean Service Medal, the United Nations Service 
  Medal, the Korean Presidential Unit Citation, the Navy's Astronaut Wings, the 
  Marine Corps' Astronaut Medal, the NASA Distinguished Service Medal, and the 
  Congressional Space Medal of Honor.</p>
<p class="biosec"><b>EXPERIENCE:</b> He entered the Naval Aviation Cadet Program 
  in March 1942 and was graduated from this program and commissioned in the Marine 
  Corps in 1943. After advanced training, he joined Marine Fighter Squadron 155 
  and spent a year flying F-4U fighters in the Marshall Islands.<br>
  <br>
  During his World War II service, he flew 59 combat missions. After the war, 
  he was a member of Marine Fighter Squadron 218 on the North China patrol and 
  served on Guam. From June 1948 to December 1950 Glenn was an instructor in advanced 
  flight training at Corpus Christi, Texas. He then attended Amphibious Warfare 
  Training at Quantico, Virginia. In Korea he flew 63 missions with Marine Fighter 
  Squadron 311. As an exchange pilot with the Air Force Glenn flew 27 missions 
  in the in F-86 Sabrejet. In the last nine days of fighting in Korea Glenn downed 
  three MIG's in combat along the Yalu River.<br>
  <br>
  After Korea, Glenn attended Test Pilot School at the Naval Air Test Center, 
  Patuxent River, Maryland. After graduation, he was project officer on a number 
  of aircraft. He was assigned to the Fighter Design Branch of the Navy Bureau 
  of Aeronautics (now Bureau of Naval Weapons) in Washington from November 1956 
  to April 1959, during which time he also attended the University of Maryland.<br>
  <br>
  In July 1957, while project officer of the F8U Crusader, he set a transcontinental 
  speed record from Los Angeles to New York, spanning the country in 3 hours and 
  23 minutes. This was the first transcontinental flight to average supersonic 
  speed. Glenn has nearly 9,000 hours of flying time, with approximately 3,000 
  hours in jet aircraft.</p>
<p class="biosec"><b>NASA EXPERIENCE:</b> Glenn was assigned to the NASA Space 
  Task Group at Langley Research Center, Hampton, Virginia, in April 1959 after 
  his selection as a Project Mercury Astronaut. The Space Task Group was moved 
  to Houston and became part of the NASA Manned Spacecraft Center in 1962. Glenn 
  flew on Mercury-6 (February 20, 1962) and STS-95 (October 29 to November 7, 
  1998), and has logged over 218 hours in space. Prior to his first flight, Glenn 
  had served as backup pilot for Astronauts Shepard and Grissom. When astronauts 
  were given special assignments to ensure pilot input into the design and development 
  of spacecraft, Glenn specialized in cockpit layout and control functioning, 
  including some of the early designs for the Apollo Project. Glenn resigned from 
  the Manned Spacecraft Center on January 16, 1964. He was promoted to the rank 
  of Colonel in October 1964 and retired from the Marine Corps on January 1, 1965. 
  He was a business executive from 1965 until his election to the United States 
  Senate in November 1974. Glenn retired from the U.S. Senate in January 1999.</p>
<p class="biosec"><b>SPACE FLIGHT EXPERIENCE:</b> On February 20, 1962, Glenn 
  piloted the Mercury-Atlas 6 &quot;Friendship 7&quot; spacecraft on the first 
  manned orbital mission of the United States. Launched from Kennedy Space Center, 
  Florida, he completed a successful three-orbit mission around the earth, reaching 
  a maximum altitude (apogee) of approximately 162 statute miles and an orbital 
  velocity of approximately 17,500 miles per hour. Glenn's &quot;Friendship 7&quot; 
  Mercury spacecraft landed approximately 800 miles southeast of KSC in the vicinity 
  of Grand Turk Island. Mission duration from launch to impact was 4 hours, 55 
  minutes, and 23 seconds.<br>
  <br>
  STS-95 <i>Discovery</i> (October 29 to November 7, 1998) was a 9-day mission 
  during which the crew supported a variety of research payloads including deployment 
  of the Spartan solar-observing spacecraft, the Hubble Space Telescope Orbital 
  Systems Test Platform, and investigations on space flight and the aging process. 
  The mission was accomplished in 134 Earth orbits, traveling 3.6 million miles 
  in 213 hours and 44 minutes.</p>
