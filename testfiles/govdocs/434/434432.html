					<P>P R O C E E D I N G S (8:32 a.m.)</P>
					<P>DR. BUSH: Good morning. My name is Donna Bush. I am with the Drug Testing 
						Section, Division of Workplace Programs, Substance Abuse Mental Health Services 
						Administration.</P>
					<P>It is my pleasure to welcome you to the Washington, D.C. area, and to this 
						meeting of the Drug Testing Advisory Board.</P>
					<P>I would like to introduce Mr. Paul Schwab. Mr. Schwab is presently the deputy 
						administrator of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 
						of the Department of Health and Human Services.</P>
					<P>In 1996 Dr. Schwab served as the acting director of the Health Resources and 
						Services Administration, HRSA, the Bureau of Health Professions, having served 
						as the bureau's deputy director since 1988.
					</P>
					<P>In earlier years he was HRSA's associate administrator for policy coordination 
						and was the executive secretary of several national public advisory committees, 
						including the Council on Graduate Medical Education, the Graduate Medical 
						Education National Advisory Committee, and the National Council on Health 
						Planning.
					</P>
					<P>He has authored a number of publications and is frequently consulted on the 
						areas of health, work force analysis, and the application of continuing quality 
						improvement principles in public administration.
					</P>
					<P>A Phi Beta Kappa graduate of George Washington University, Mr. Schwab has also 
						earned graduate degrees in economics and public administration from Indiana 
						University and the Kennedy School at Harvard respectively.
					</P>
					<P>He has received numerous honors and awards, including the Presidential, 
						Distinguished and Meritorious executive rank awards, the HHS Secretary's award 
						for exceptional achievement, and the Public Health Service Superior Service 
						Award. Mr. Schwab.
					</P>
					<P>Agenda Item: Welcome.</P>
					<P>MR. SCHWAB: Thank you, Dr. Bush, for that introduction. I promise you I will try 
						to keep my remarks briefer than the introduction this morning, but I appreciate 
						it. I do want to welcome you all, and good morning, here.</P>
					<P>The Administrator of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services 
						Administration, Dr. Nelba Chavez, was not able to join with us this morning, 
						but I do send her greetings.</P>
					<P>SAMHSA, which is the agency in which our program here is housed, is not always a 
						household word, to say the least, in terms of government agencies.</P>
					<P>It is very unique as far as government health agencies are concerned in being 
						really the only part of the federal government where substance abuse and mental 
						health come together. Our agenda, working with the public, is quite broad.
					</P>
					<P>In Dr. Chavez' absence, it is indeed my pleasure to welcome you today to this 
						meeting of the Drug Testing Advisory Board, the scientific meeting on drug 
						testing of alternative specimens and technologies.
					</P>
					<P>We have invited you here today because of our commitment to making our work 
						places safe from drugs.</P>
					<P>The statistics clearly tell the story. Seven out of ten drug users hold down 
						jobs. Economists say now that work place drug abuse costs us somewhere between 
						$60 and $100 billion a year in lost productivity.
					</P>
					<P>Whether it is hospital workers or truck drivers, mail carriers or mechanics, the 
						results are always the same. They are always tragic.
					</P>
					<P>That is why our federal work place drug testing programs are critical and why 
						this meeting is so important.</P>
					<P>Just a brief word on the board itself. The board was first chartered in 1990. It 
						advises the Administrator of SAMHSA and recommends new areas for emphasis or 
						de-emphasis, new or changed directions, and mechanisms or approaches for 
						implementing recommendations.</P>
					<P>As part of this function, the board periodically reviews scientific areas on new 
						areas of abuse and the methods necessary to detect their presence.</P>
					<P>We consider this meeting, and you, all helping us to maintain high standards for 
						our federal work place drug testing programs.
					</P>
					<P>That means we must enlist you as a resource as we develop our knowledge of the 
						scientific advances. We regard this meeting as an open and objective forum for 
						the presentation of new technologies, and focus on the science, and be as fair 
						as possible in reviewing that science.
					</P>
					<P>In that regard, we are indeed pleased that so many distinguished scientists have 
						joined us today. There is a great deal of interest on our part in evolving drug 
						testing technologies and alternative specimens, so that the determination of 
						substance abuse can remain state of the science, and so that less invasive 
						techniques or specimens can be used fairly, accurately, and reliably.
					</P>
					<P>in closing, it is going to take all of us working together to get drugs out of 
						the work place, and to send a clear message to American workers that if they 
						use drugs, we will not hire them.
					</P>
					<P>Now I would like to present Dr. Joe Autry, the director of the Division of Work 
						Place programs, who will tell you more about this meeting. Thank you.
					</P>
					<P>DR. BUSH: Thank you, Mr. Schwab. Now I would like to introduce Dr. Joseph Autry. 
						For those of you who don't know, he is my boss.
					</P>
					<P>Dr. Autry received his bachelor's degree from Rhodes University with majors in 
						chemistry and psychology. He received his doctorate of medicine from the 
						University of Tennessee.</P>
					<P>He completed an internship in internal medicine at Baptist Memorial Hospital, 
						where he ran a coronary care unit for several months. He completed his 
						residency training in psychiatry at the
					</P>
					<P>National Institute of Mental Health, St. Elizabeth's Hospital, model residency 
						training program.</P>
					<P>He was board certified by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology in 
						1976.
					</P>
					<P>Dr. Autry had an active career as a practicing psychiatrist prior to coming to 
						the Washington area, joining the National Institute of Mental Health and 
						becoming the director of extramural research, taking on responsibility for 
						basic research, clinical research, treatment research and applied research.</P>
					<P>He took on the challenges of directing the Office of Policy Analysis and 
						Coordination for the National Institute of Mental Health, and then for the 
						Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Administration, NIMH's parent 
						organization, for NIMH.</P>
					<P>In 1990, Dr. Autry decided to move back into research, and became the director 
						of the Division of Applied Research at the National Institute on Drug Abuse, 
						with responsibility for work on drug-free work place programs, work place 
						policies related to substance abuse and AIDS in the work place, health services 
						research, research on HIV infection and AIDS in the community.
					</P>
					<P>He had oversight for the national laboratory certification program, which 
						certifies laboratories to conduct drug testing for federal drug free work place 
						programs and the federally regulated industries.
					</P>
					<P>Following the reorganization of ADAMHA in 1992, Dr. Autry became director of the 
						Division of Work Place Programs for SAMHSA, the Center of Substance Abuse 
						Prevention, with oversight responsibility for all the federal drug free work 
						place programs and the national lab
					</P>
					<P>certification program for forensic urine drug testing. Additionally, Dr. Autry 
						continues his part time private
					</P>
					<P>practice of psychiatry, which he frequently describes as his link to the 
						non-bureaucratic world, and an opportunity to constantly infuse his federal 
						research and services responsibility with a continuing need for new knowledge 
						to deal with the problems of mental illness and substance abuse in clinical 
						practice. Dr. Autry.</P>
					<P>Agenda Item: Federal Workplace Drug Testing.</P>
					<P>DR. AUTRY: Actually, what I have said is that private
					</P>
					<P>practice is frequently my link to sanity.</P>
					<P>Let me just start by saying that it is real pleasure to see so many friends and 
						colleagues and other interested parties at this Drug Testing Advisory Board.
					</P>
					<P>As Paul told you, the board periodically reviews emerging drug testing 
						technologies, alternative specimens and inclusion of additional drugs and drug 
						classes, and has provided ongoing advice to the National Laboratory 
						Certification Program and the federal drug free work program since 1990.
					</P>
					<P>It is a key component in formulating or recommending any change in policy in 
						these important areas for the federal government. This is the first time since 
						Mike Walsh was a pup -- for
					</P>
					<P>those of you who know Mike, that has been a while -- that the board has formally 
						reviewed the principles and criteria necessary for any workplace drug testing 
						program to be forensically defensible.</P>
					<P>Then, it is to evaluate all the emerging and current technologies and 
						alternative specimens, to see how they meet these principles and criteria.
					</P>
					<P>If there are areas in which they are deficient, they are to make recommendations 
						on how they can meet these criteria.
					</P>
					<P>I want to emphasize for all of you that the focus of this meeting is on the 
						science of testing technologies and alternative specimens.
					</P>
					<P>It is not a meeting to advocate for any testing technology or alternative 
						specimen.
					</P>
					<P>Let me tell you what the meeting will not do. The meeting will not result in the 
						recommendation of any emerging technology or alternative specimen for inclusion 
						in the federal drug free workplace program, or the mandatory guidelines.
					</P>
					<P>What it will do is to formalize the principles and criteria necessary for a 
						forensically defensible work place program, and it will gather all the extant 
						scientific data that is available for the current or emerging technologies and 
						alternative specimens for future evaluation and recommendation.</P>
					<P>What we will do today is we will start with an overview of the forensic and 
						scientific requirements for a workplace drug testing program, followed by an 
						overview of the alternative technologies and specimens that are currently 
						available.
					</P>
					<P>We have asked Dr. Ed Cone, who most of you know, from the National Institute on 
						Drug Abuse, Addiction Research Center, and Dr. Yale Caplan of Quest 
						Diagnostics, to present these two overviews.
					</P>
					<P>As you can see from the program, each one of the essential areas for a 
						successful workplace program will then begin with a brief overview of the 
						principles and criteria necessary for that area, followed by a response from 
						representatives of current or emerging technologies or alternative specimens.</P>
					<P>These include urine specimen, hair testing, saliva testing, sweat testing and 
						on-site testing.</P>
					<P>The moderator of each session will give a brief overview.
					</P>
					<P>The respondents were chosen by a scientist or other representative who works in 
						the field of the testing technology or alternative specimen.
					</P>
					<P>This method was chosen to eliminate any potential for conflict of interest or 
						bias in selecting the respondents.
					</P>
					<P>The coordinators who chose these respondents are as follows:
					</P>
					<P>for urine testing, Walt Vogel who works with the National Laboratory 
						Certification Program; for hair testing Don Kippenberger from Psychemedics; for 
						saliva testing Sam Niedbala from STC Technologies; for
					</P>
					<P>sweat testing Neil Fortner from PharmChem; and for on-site testing Dave Evans 
						who works with the National On-Site Testing Association.</P>
					<P>We are going to limit the overview remarks in each session to five minutes and 
						each respondent will be limited to 15 minutes.
					</P>
					<P>Each presenter has been asked to finish his or her sentence upon hearing the 
						signal indicating that time is up, and not to go on beyond that sentence.</P>
					<P>Hopefully we will allow additional time for discussion and comments at the end 
						of each session.
					</P>
					<P>Questions and answers are going to be limited to board members and presenters. 
						If members of the audience have questions that they wish to address to 
						presenters, please write them on the four-by-six cards which you will be 
						provided and pass them up front. We will make sure that the board members get 
						them for consideration.
					</P>
					<P>We have set aside Wednesday morning, April 30, for presentations and comments 
						from the public. You must sign up in advance, and I underscore that. You must 
						sign up in advance to present or comment on Wednesday morning.
					</P>
					<P>The order of presentation or comment will be determined by the order in which 
						you sign up. The time that each presenter has will be determined by taking the 
						total amount of time we have available and dividing by the number of people we 
						have signed up. That will be announced to you either late Tuesday or first 
						thing Wednesday morning.
					</P>
					<P>Following clarification and discussion of additional issues by the board, the 
						meeting will adjourn, and there will be a press conference at the end of the 
						meeting for any interested members of the press.
					</P>
					<P>The board will reconvene sometime in mid-summer to consider all the scientific 
						information and deliberations, and to at that time make recommendations about 
						the status of the existing or emerging technologies or alternative specimens.
					</P>
					<P>Of course, we will make sure that all of you know well in advance when that 
						meeting will be scheduled and where it will be scheduled.
					</P>
					<P>If this approach is as successful as I hope it will be, we will schedule 
						periodic updates and public meetings of the board to do this same thing again, 
						so that we can constantly look at emerging technologies and alternative 
						specimens and their applicability in the work force for the federal drug free 
						workplace program.
					</P>
					<P>With that, I am going to be quiet and let us turn to the focus of this meeting, 
						and that is the science. Thank you.
					</P>
					<P>DR. BUSH: Thank you, Dr. Autry. We now have two major presentations. They are 
						going to be full of great science and great overviews for us.</P>
					<P>I have a biosketch for each of these scientists, Dr. Ed.
					</P>
					<P>Cone and Dr. Yale Caplan.</P>
					<P>We try to make these bios brief. But you know, when people have a long and 
						illustrious career in science, they are not brief, they have done so much.</P>
					<P>I want to read Ed's bio to you. It is a bit lengthy, but bear with me, and 
						consider all the information that you hear. I think that will better seat his 
						presentation in his mind, the depth of experience that comes from it.
					</P>
					<P>Edward J. Cone received his BS in chemistry from Mobile College and earned his 
						PhD in organic chemistry from the University of Alabama.
					</P>
					<P>From 1971 to 1972, he held a post-doc appointment in the department of 
						chemistry, University of Kentucky, under the direction of Professor Ellis 
						Brown.</P>
					<P>His work at the University of Kentucky was in the area of tobacco chemistry.
					</P>
					<P>In the summer of 1972, he joined the staff of the Addiction Research Center, 
						National Institute on Drug Abuse, where he currently serves as chief of the 
						chemistry and drug metabolism section.</P>
					<P>Dr. Cone is a commissioned officer in the United States Public Health Service 
						and has the rank of permanent director grade, CO-06.
					</P>
					<P>He was appointed as a member of the Research Officers Group of the United States 
						Public Health Service in 1989.</P>
					<P>From 1977 to 1985, he served as a member of the adjunct faculty in the Division 
						of Pharmaceutics and Pharmaceutical Analysis, School of Pharmacy, University of 
						Kentucky.</P>
					<P>Presently he is adjunct professor in the toxicology program, University of 
						Maryland at Baltimore.</P>
					<P>Dr. Cone has maintained his academic association, by training four candidates 
						for their PhD degree in forensic toxicology, by presenting lectures to medical, 
						pharmacy, pharmacology and toxicology students on the chemistry and toxicology 
						of drugs of abuse, and by hosting graduate students -- post-doctoral fellows 
						and visiting foreign fellows -- in his laboratory.
					</P>
					<P>In addition, Dr. Cone's laboratory has served as a training station for three 
						World Health Organization fellows from Thailand and Malaysia.</P>
					<P>He was a member of the editorial boards of the Journal of Drug Metabolism and 
						Kinetics, and Employment Testing, and is presently serving on the editorial 
						board of the Journal of Analytical Toxicology.
					</P>
					<P>At present, Dr. Cone is serving as vice chairman of the Institutional Review 
						Board for the intramural research program, NIDA, in Baltimore.
					</P>
					<P>His major research interests are in the disposition and metabolisms of drugs of 
						abuse, and drug-induced behavioral effects.
					</P>
					<P>Dr. Cone's early research led to the elucidation of two new metabolic pathways 
						for the environmental exposure to drugs of abuse, and on saliva and hair 
						testing as means of identifying drugs exposure has been recognized 
						internationally.</P>
					<P>Dr. Cone has presented his findings at numerous international meetings, 
						conferences and workshops.
					</P>
					<P>Currently he is conducting clinical research on the relationship of behavior and 
						performance to specific levels of drugs in blood, saliva, sweat, urine, hair 
						and skin.
					</P>
					<P>Dr. Cone's research has resulted in the publication of numerous book chapters, 
						and over 200 scientific articles on the analysis of drugs in biological media.
					</P>
					<P>Dr. Cone was cited by Science Watch, a journal which tracks trends and 
						performance in basic research, as being the most highly cited author in 
						forensic science over the period 1981 to 1993.</P>
					<P>Dr. Cone was awarded the Irving Sunshine Award in clinical toxicology, in 
						recognition of pioneering work in clinical toxicology in 1995, at the 
						International Association of Therapeutic Drug Monitoring.
					</P>
					<P>Recently, Dr. Cone was recognized by the Commissioned Officers Association as 
						the CIPAC Career Scientist of the Year Award in 1996.
					</P>
					<P>This award was to acknowledge an exemplary career of pioneering research on the 
						detection of psychoactive drugs in humans, and for the broad implication of 
						discoveries to improve drug abuse, prevention and treatment. Dr. Cone.
					</P>
					<P>(Applause.)</P>
					<P>Agenda Item: Forensic and Scientific Requirements for a workplace Drug Testing 
						Program.
					</P>
					<P>DR. CONE: It is truly a real honor to be here. As Donna overstated many of the 
						things that I have done, I have been involved in drug analysis for many years 
						and have met many puzzled expressions on the clinical ward when I have walked 
						down. They have looked at me and said, you want to test what?</P>
					<P>Thank you, anyway, for being here, and welcome to this conference. It is an 
						honor to be invited to present this opening talk.
					</P>
					<P>We are all keenly aware of the many problems that drugs impose upon our society, 
						by the epidemic of drug abuse that currently engulfs our nation.
					</P>
					<P>The scourge of drug abuse robs us of many valuable lives, intellect and property 
						that we can sorely afford to lose.</P>
					<P>Among the many approaches that we can take to eliminate the problem, the 
						application of our unique scientific talents is the one that we in this room 
						can most contribute.
					</P>
					<P>It is really my belief that solutions must first begin with acknowledgement of 
						the problem and good tools. I think that drug testing technology offers the 
						clinician the tools to work on the problem, recognition of whether a person is 
						using drugs, is under the influence or has been exposed to drugs. I think that 
						is what we are here to talk about.</P>
					<P>It is my charge to review briefly the forensic and scientific requirements for a 
						workplace drug testing program. That is a pretty big charge.
					</P>
					<P>What I am going to try to do very quickly is go through and talk briefly about 
						the alternate matrices and, as well, many of my comments will be applicable to 
						on-site drug testing.
					</P>
					<P>I am going to spend most of the time talking about, first, how forensic 
						standards have been established through promulgation of the guidelines.
					</P>
					<P>I will go through many of the specific requirements, now, that I think we have 
						evolved for forensic requirements in drug testing in the work place.
					</P>
					<P>We are going to talk about how you go about validating a specimen, an assay, and 
						the need for quality assurance methods and quality control materials.
					</P>
					<P>Finally, I am just going to spend a very brief amount of time talking about the 
						maturation and how technology evolves, and how this technology affects public 
						health.
					</P>
					<P>I want to start with this quote from Walter Haines in 1904 who said that there 
						is scarcely a part of the body that may not be examined with profit.</P>
					<P>Clearly, what he means is that you can find out a lot of information from drug 
						testing.
					</P>
					<P>This is a slide that I have used many times now in talks where I have 
						illustrated the luxury and richness of the availability of different biological 
						fluids in tissues for drug testing.
					</P>
					<P>Many of them we are going to be focusing on today are specific ones of sweat, 
						hair, saliva, as compared to urine and on-site testing.
					</P>
					<P>There are other possible tissues that you will be hearing about in the future we 
						are hearing about. Commercial methods are already available for marconium.</P>
					<P>We are still working on how to drug test for sneezes, but there are a number of 
						things that we can get from alternate matrices.
					</P>
					<P>This is just a quick sampling of some of the things. There is unique 
						information, surely, in different biological matrices that you can't get from 
						urine or blood.
					</P>
					<P>There are other advantages that one could possibly get.
					</P>
					<P>Some of the matrices will involve less invasive collection techniques. Hair 
						sampling possibly will allow you to go back and get a
					</P>
					<P>specific specimen within a few days that represents almost the identical 
						specimen, something you can't do, of course, with liquid samples.</P>
					<P>Some of the other advantages, quite often now in urine we test for inactive 
						metabolites. In different alternate matrices you often find the parent drug.</P>
					<P>It is much more satisfying when you are trying to interpret what is happening to 
						a subject to know that you are testing actual active drug rather than an 
						inactive metabolite.</P>
					<P>Some of the matrices also may exhibit greater stability than urine, lower 
						disease risk, easy collection, shipment and storage.
					</P>
					<P>There are a list of things we can think about as we go through these days in 
						terms of what the advantages are there.
					</P>
					<P>There may be disadvantages as well. You have to consider the difference in 
						matrix as you collect and begin to develop tests for different biological 
						specimens.
					</P>
					<P>You have to consider, of course, the stability of the analyte, what the analyte 
						is, the stability, how you go about getting the analyte out in a pure form, 
						what form of assay is going to be developed.
					</P>
					<P>A very important function is how are you going to develop QC materials that go 
						hand in hand with the development of the assay that are appropriate for that 
						specific assay.</P>
					<P>There are major differences. Urine, of course, is mainly an aqueous matrix. 
						Saliva offers some advantage, in that it is somewhat easier to collect and a 
						little bit less embarrassing to collect.</P>
					<P>It is also an aqueous base, but it has other things like mucous, that also 
						affects things like how easy it is to pipette a specimen. So, it is a little 
						bit more difficult to measure saliva.
					</P>
					<P>Sweat is an aqueous medium, but it is mainly collected by means of adsorption 
						onto some sort of collection device.
					</P>
					<P>You have to worry about how do you get the drug off the collection device. You 
						have to worry about absorption.</P>
					<P>You also have to worry, if you are using a collection device that applies to the 
						skin, about environmental contamination, both before you put the specimen on, 
						the patch on, and during the process of taking the collection device off the 
						skin. Environmental contamination is certainly a possible risk.
					</P>
					<P>Specific advantages, we have mentioned already a little bit about hair. It is a 
						very different matrix. It is a dry, protein complex.</P>
					<P>So, it presents its own problems in terms of how do you get the drug out of the 
						complex as well. Of course, there are risks from environmental contamination.
					</P>
					<P>There is the issue of what effect does melanin have, or what is the effect of 
						melanin on the type of drug and the amount of drug that is present.
					</P>
					<P>So, there are major differences in the matrices that we will be talking about 
						throughout the conference. We want to look at them objectively, fairly, and 
						consider what they offer in terms of new information, and advantages over 
						existing technology.
					</P>
					<P>Now, in terms of what are standards, we have seen over the last decade an 
						incredible evolution toward where we are today in terms of forensic drug 
						testing standards.
					</P>
					<P>President Reagan issued his Executive Order in 1986, 12564, where he stated 
						essentially that he wanted to achieve a drug free federal workplace.</P>
					<P>That really set the standard of where he wanted us to be. Over the years we have 
						certainly established some specific standards.
					</P>
					<P>The HHS was authorized to promulgate scientific and technical guidelines for 
						drug testing programs, and those standards have been published and updated.
					</P>
					<P>They have been put into effect and really become the expected standard for 
						forensic drug testing over the years.
					</P>
					<P>Not only have federal agencies adopted these guidelines, but so have DOD, DOT, 
						states, as well as private industry have come to expect the quality of drug 
						testing that was established through this program.
					</P>
					<P>This is a quote about where we have come to in terms of society's acceptance of 
						drug testing. It simply says:
					</P>
					<P>"Over the past decade, incumbent presidents and Congress have not only 
						authorized drug testing by public and private employees, but have required or 
						encouraged it in some work places...
					</P>
					<P>"...the policies of previous administrations, the legislature and judicial 
						systems have all contributed to establishing drug testing as a major component 
						of the nation's `war on drugs'."
					</P>
					<P>Obviously we have these standards. We have to remember in what context we are 
						trying to apply them, in this specific instance the workplace setting.
					</P>
					<P>It is a very unique setting. It is a setting where a single test result is 
						generally the only piece of evidence involved in hiring, forced treatment, or 
						firing of employees.</P>
					<P>So, it is very important that we place the highest degree of expectation of 
						accuracy on our drug testing processes.</P>
					<P>The quality of the tests, we know, is only as good as the sum total of the 
						entire process of collection, the testing process, reporting and review by 
						medical review officers.</P>
					<P>Now to those standards. There are a host of very specific standards laid out in 
						the guidelines. I would like to start out by saying these are the guidelines 
						for urine drug testing.
					</P>
					<P>I fully understand that the matrix that we are talking about is different and 
						the guidelines may not apply to the matrix that we are talking about in this 
						conference as well as on-site testing, but they certainly provide a place to 
						start.
					</P>
					<P>They are the expected standards for forensic testing as it exists today.
					</P>
					<P>We are going to go through very quickly and just talk about some of these 
						different sections of forensic workplace drug testing and how they should 
						apply.</P>
					<P>When we are talking about drug testing, we first have to identify specifically, 
						exactly what happens to the specimen during the entire course of collection, 
						handling and storage of specimens.</P>
					<P>That has to be clearly stated in a standard operating procedure document. This 
						document is the legal description of what actually happens to the specimen. It 
						has to be an accurate updated version which includes all processes in the 
						receipt, collection, handling, testing and storage of the specimen.
					</P>
					<P>It should describe in detail how a chain of custody is applied to these 
						processes. It should describe how quality control and quality assurance 
						practices are implemented at each step along the way.
					</P>
					<P>It should describe the training and expectations of personnel. It should have 
						considerations of what is needed in the facilities and how it is organized, and 
						an entire detailed description of the other related issues like instrumentation 
						and processes for reporting. This has to be a complete document.
					</P>
					<P>There are considerations for how the test facility should be organized. In urine 
						drug testing, there is the requirement that screening and confirmation be 
						performed at the same site, that security be given the highest order of 
						magnitude for consideration, that forensic work be generally separated from 
						non-forensic work, and there be limited access to the drug testing areas, to 
						specimens and to records, and there be a general infrastructure of support.</P>
					<P>Chain of custody I couldn't say much about the importance of an adequate chain 
						of custody. This is just a definition, one definition, which says:
					</P>
					<P>Procedures to account for the integrity, identification and security of 
						specimens by tracking their handling, storage from of collection, to the final 
						disposition of the specimen.</P>
					<P>This is the legal document that tracks and identifies how it was collected, when 
						it was collected, how it was shipped to the laboratory, what the laboratory did 
						to it and the final disposition.
					</P>
					<P>It is an essential document that has to exist in the context of workplace drug 
						testing.</P>
					<P>The requirement, of course, for workplace drug testing is that each and every 
						test can potentially result in litigation, and every step along the way has to 
						be defensible.
					</P>
					<P>The chain of custody covers collection, as I said, transport to the laboratory, 
						what is happening in terms of accessioning and processing and testing 
						throughout the laboratory, all the way through to the final reporting of the 
						result.
					</P>
					<P>Security at the collection site is also an important consideration, how do you 
						collect the specimen, how do you identify the specimen, how do you get it into 
						some form of container that can then be either tested or shipped to the 
						laboratory.</P>
					<P>These are all considerations that we are very familiar with,
					</P>
					<P>but they have to be adapted to the new types of specimens.</P>
					<P>In some cases they may be a challenge, but it requires that
					</P>
					<P>we have specific methodologies for assuring that the specimen belongs to the 
						subject or the employee, that it not be tampered with, that it not be 
						adulterated, that there be no switching.</P>
					<P>So, these are important procedures that we have to think about when we are 
						designing collection processes.
					</P>
					<P>The security at the test facility, as I said, is absolutely of the highest 
						regard. Access must be restricted to authorized personnel.
					</P>
					<P>Security procedures must be in place, both during and after working hours. There 
						is the highest level of security accorded to both specimens and, frequently 
						forgotten, those important records.</P>
					<P>Security has to be considered when you are designing your computer systems, the 
						laboratory information system, as well as documentation of the processes that 
						are used in security.
					</P>
					<P>Many laboratories are designing their facilities so that frequent tours -- there 
						is always somebody wanting to take a tour of a laboratory -- so that those 
						tours are performed so that they can be performed without having the people on 
						the tour go into the test facility.
					</P>
					<P>They are actually designing laboratories -- this has been done for a number of 
						years now -- so that you can take the tour and walk around the outside of the 
						test facility and look in through usually protected areas.
					</P>
					<P>The test methods themselves are usually composed of a screening test, which has 
						traditionally been immunoassay as a requirement for urine drug testing.
					</P>
					<P>The screening test is followed by a confirmation test.
					</P>
					<P>There is a requirement, of course, that the confirmation test be based on a 
						different chemical principle or a different chromatographic principle than the 
						initial screening test.</P>
					<P>This has also been traditional GC/MS. There is no reason why it can't be LC/MS 
						or some other acceptable substitute.
					</P>
					<P>A few words about the screening test. You have to, when designing your initial 
						testing procedure, take into consideration, of course, the differences in the 
						matrix, how you are going to handle that matrix, how you are going to extract, 
						if necessary, and how you are going to apply your assay to this rather unique, 
						different biological specimen.
					</P>
					<P>There is a need for at least some form of semi-quantitative response, and of 
						course you have to define the operational parameters that are needed to assess 
						the performance of the assay, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precision and 
						so on.</P>
					<P>You certainly have to identify the other materials that may cross react, 
						potential interferences.</P>
					<P>You have to make sure that there are available reference materials. The QC issue 
						is a real problem sometimes with new matrices, and we will talk a little bit 
						more about that.</P>
					<P>A real trouble spot is establishing a new cut off for a biological matrix. This 
						is probably one of the most challenging things, once you have developed an 
						assay for a specimen, is to come up with the appropriate cut off concentration.</P>
					<P>There are very good, solid methods, scientifically based methods, for 
						determining what optimal cut offs are with the use of receiver operating 
						curves, and the like.
					</P>
					<P>Other considerations in the screening assay, you must think about what is going 
						to happen after the screening is done, and consider the confirmation assay.</P>
					<P>You need to approximate, to some degree, the analytical sensitivity of the 
						confirmation method. You don't want an assay that is far more sensitive than 
						your confirmation assay. You certainly don't want one that is less sensitive.</P>
					<P>So, you must think about the development of the screening in the context of what 
						the confirmation method is going to be.
					</P>
					<P>There is certainly a need for sensitivity. Then specificity, we said this 
						already but I mean this in a clinical sense, the clinical definition now of 
						sensitivity, which means the ratio of true positives plus false negatives.
					</P>
					<P>So, you want to maximize the identification of true positives and minimize false 
						negatives, of course, with sensitivity. You can give up a little bit on 
						specificity usually to
					</P>
					<P>achieve this goal, where you maximize true negatives and minimize false 
						positives.</P>
					<P>There is some need for linearity around the cut offs so you can have good 
						precision. Finally, of course -- we have said this already -- the consideration 
						of what the cut off is going to be is going to be one of the major decisions 
						that you are going to be facing.
					</P>
					<P>The confirmation assay is also an issue where you have to consider -- again, 
						even more important, you have to identify now a way to get the drug or the 
						analyte out of the specimen, generally, if you are going to use the combined 
						methodologies.</P>
					<P>You have got to get it somehow into usually a liquid matrix.
					</P>
					<P>So, you have got to consider, how do you get the analyte out of your unique 
						matrix and into a form that can be analyzed by one of the combined 
						technologies.
					</P>
					<P>Now we insist upon quantitation and accurate quantitation, and of course the 
						other performance parameters, including specificity, accuracy and precision.
					</P>
					<P>You need to evaluate and make sure that there are no interferences, and define 
						the LOD LOQ linearity and so forth.
					</P>
					<P>Again, we get back to this issue of pharmacologically relevant cut off. How do 
						we do that? That is usually somewhat problematic.
					</P>
					<P>This is a slide where I have sort of tried to illustrate the overlap between the 
						two major considerations in establishing a cut off concentration, the 
						pharmacological issues versus the analytical issues.
					</P>
					<P>They are totally overlapping in terms of considerations when you are trying to 
						establish a cut off concentration.
					</P>
					<P>You have to select a cut off or a concentration that can be detected by your 
						assay. So, of course you certainly have to have the sensitivity from your 
						requisite analytical assay. You also have to know what is there and how to 
						detect it, and in what concentration in that particular biofluid are you going 
						to find drug.</P>
					<P>You also have to worry about setting the cut off concentration such that you can 
						distinguish, we would hope, active use from potential environmental 
						contamination.</P>
					<P>You have to take into consideration other issues like, are there going to be 
						major influences from route of administration or passive exposure and so forth.</P>
					<P>So, what I have tried to do is illustrate this by throwing in an extra slide 
						here. This is sort of like selecting a cut off where you have to have really 
						sound scientific reasons for selection, when you grab the tiger by its tail. 
						Otherwise, he might turn around and bite you.</P>
					<P>What I tried to do here is illustrate that I think this company has done a 
						pretty nice job of selecting a cut off that is well removed from the 
						possibility of environmental contamination.</P>
					<P>The noise from their assay system, passive exposure, contamination carry over 
						and so forth, this looks like they have done a pretty nice job of establishing 
						that cut off.</P>
					<P>Another company didn't quite get the message. You can see we have a problem 
						here. I would characterize this situation as the company being somewhat 
						alligator challenged.</P>
					<P>We have a lot of ground to cover and I am going to go through these quickly. 
						Quality control we will spend an entire session on.</P>
					<P>It is absolutely essential that the appropriate reference materials be 
						available, and that you somehow devise a method whereby you can supply and 
						utilize quality control materials that simulate or are very close to real 
						clinical specimens.</P>
					<P>That has been a real problem with many of our alternate matrices, is coming up 
						with appropriate QC materials.</P>
					<P>There is an entire science behind developing these materials. But it is a very 
						important consideration if you are developing an assay for a new matrix or even 
						an on-site test.</P>
					<P>I would make a quick comment about on-site testing. There is quite often a QC 
						check on the on-site test device.</P>
					<P>It is my contention that most of these devices are not actual QC controls in the 
						traditional sense of being a positive or a negative.</P>
					<P>They are very good QC checks for the operation of the assay and the reagents. 
						But they do not fit the traditional definition of a control.</P>
					<P>So, in addition to those very nice checks that are built into on-site devices, 
						you still need appropriate control materials to be run, both in an open and a 
						blind manner.</P>
					<P>You need to assess the performance of the assay and of course the accompanying 
						quality assurance issues.</P>
					<P>Reporting, the guidelines require that reporting results only go out to medical 
						review officers. There are good reasons for that. We will talk a little bit 
						about that in a minute, that prohibit telephonic reporting.</P>
					<P>Again, security. The form of reporting must be secure. Certified copies are sent 
						to the employers -- I should say MROs. The standard forms really simplify 
						things as well.</P>
					<P>Storage, you have to consider the requirement for not only protecting the 
						specimens and the records with secured storage, but then they have to be 
						retained in forensic testing.</P>
					<P>The standard is for positive specimens for a year, and records for at least two 
						years.</P>
					<P>Personnel. Personnel are probably your most important aspect in laboratory 
						operations. They have to be trained in forensic drug testing methods.</P>
					<P>You have to have training documented for all your personnel.
					</P>
					<P>As you go up the chain, the documentation needs increase for your supervisors 
						and your certifying scientists, as well.</P>
					<P>There must be very good personnel records throughout that document the training 
						of your people in the laboratory.</P>
					<P>The facility or the lab director is the ultimate person in charge, must be 
						involved in day-to-day operations, and must have adequate training in forensic 
						toxicology to serve in this role.
					</P>
					<P>Confidentiality is an issue that we all worry about. We want to protect 
						individual rights at the same time.</P>
					<P>There are a number of ways to do this; by employee ideas instead of names, 
						strict reporting rules, reporting security, and the use of MROs.</P>
					<P>I want to say a word about MROs. They have really served an extremely important 
						component of the urine drug testing program that is outlined by the HHS.</P>
					<P>Their job is to review routine custody and control forms and determine whether 
						the test result looks like a valid test result of not.
					</P>
					<P>They can listen to the applicant or the employee who tested positive, and who 
						may have a valid reason for testing positive.</P>
					<P>They can intercede for those positives who are legitimate and make sure that 
						they are not accused of being a drug user because of a legitimate excuse.</P>
					<P>They have access to medical records. They can order retests, and they can 
						protect the confidentiality of the medical records.</P>
					<P>So, this is an extremely important function that the MRO serves. I can tell you 
						that they have prevented several mistakes from happening over the years in the 
						drug testing program. They have served a very important function in this role.</P>
					<P>Finally, in the accreditation area, there is a need for consideration of 
						accreditation, whereby an independent body reviews the drug testing.</P>
					<P>They can utilize performance testing, inspections and remediation. Hopefully 
						there are enough teeth in the program to allow for those labs that are not 
						meeting standards to have their certification suspended or even revoked.</P>
					<P>I am going to move and change my focus and go through quickly now the issue of 
						how do you validate an assay.</P>
					<P>I am going to turn from forensic requirements and talk quickly about what 
						validity means.</P>
					<P>I think one of the simplest and most elegant definitions of validity of testing 
						has been defined by Chuck Oredetsky as the ability of an assay to detect a drug 
						or its metabolites in biological fluids following human drug administration.</P>
					<P>This is a very simple and elegant explanation, but it encompasses a variety of 
						issues that one must consider, including the things that we said already -- 
						sensitivity, specificity of the assays, the metabolic and pharmacologic 
						variables such as dose, route of administration, concentration of the drug in 
						the biological fluid, the pH and intersubject variability and absorption, 
						metabolism and excretion.</P>
					<P>Not only do you have to validate your analytical assay -- we spent enough time 
						on that -- but you need to perform pharmacological assessments.</P>
					<P>These are best done with clinical dosing studies. .You have to ultimately apply 
						the assay in a real setting to determine how it works.</P>
					<P>You need to define what detection times are and ultimately build a scientific 
						base of what the testing positive means in terms of results.</P>
					<P>We need that scientific base to be able to provide interpretation of positive 
						and negative specimen results.</P>
					<P>The validity has to go through a variety of components, of understanding what 
						the pharmacology of the drug is, how it is distributed, and what is distributed 
						into the different biological matrices, and most important, for interpretation, 
						we need to understand time course and the relationship between concentration of 
						drug in the matrix and relationship to dose.</P>
					<P>We have to worry, of course, about the issue of multiple dosing and accumulation 
						in tissues.</P>
					<P>This is a slide that I put together that I think reflects my view now about how 
						technology can evolve over time.</P>
					<P>The development and improvement of a new technology does not stop when the test 
						becomes available for use in the work place.</P>
					<P>At this early stage, the scientific and legal challenges have just begun. There 
						will be continual scrutiny by the forensic community of an assay's strengths 
						and weaknesses over the entire lifetime of a product.</P>
					<P>Legal challenges are likely to be made based on its use in the work place.</P>
					<P>New applications are often discovered in products that were not imagined by the 
						original designers. Important weaknesses may also be identified that require 
						adjustments in product design or process design.</P>
					<P>Ultimately, inferior products fall by the wayside, while good products get 
						better.</P>
					<P>The development of a new test, its commercial introduction, application and use 
						by the public, and general acceptance by the forensic and legal communities can 
						take a variety of courses.</P>
					<P>Many new methods may never make it to the status of general use and acceptance. 
						How a technology evolves is dependent on many factors. Frequently, the 
						philosophy of a company that seeks to market a technology is an important 
						factor in its evolutionary path. Scientific acceptance general begins with 
						publication of studies in peer reviewed journals. These studies general 
						establish the assay's performance and describe possible new applications.</P>
					<P>As the number of supporting applications build, a product may attain a comfort 
						level of acceptance within the scientific community.</P>
					<P>In a few cases, FDA review and approval provides additional assurances of 
						adequacy or comparability to existing products.</P>
					<P>By their very nature, new products will face a tougher challenge in facing broad 
						acceptance and use.</P>
					<P>This is the final slide. It really reflects how I feel about where we stand and 
						what we are trying to contribute to society. During the evolution of a work 
						place drug testing product from design to marketing, developers should evaluate 
						how their products are viewed and used.</P>
					<P>Ethical companies strive to produce companies that employers and employees trust 
						and rely upon to be fair and accurate.</P>
					<P>At the same time, employees have the right to expect that their test results 
						will be kept confidential, and that the intrusion into their privacy will be as 
						minimal as possible.</P>
					<P>Fairness and due process must be incorporated into the program, and there should 
						be opportunities in which the accused can be evaluated to determine if they 
						have legitimate explanations of test results.</P>
					<P>Overall, the important goal of keeping the work place environment drug free and 
						safe should be balanced against protecting basic individual rights.</P>
					<P>The creation of accurate test methods can be an important contribution in 
						advancing the public good and health of our people and our nation. Thank you 
						for your attention.(Applause.)</P>

					<P>Agenda Item: Overview of Alternative Specimens/Technologies.</P>
					<P>DR. CAPLAN: Thank you, Donna. She left out the one thing, that she was one of my 
						students. I think she was afraid to admit that here.</P>
					<P>It is a pleasure also to be here this morning. I understand why Dr. Cone wanted 
						five more minutes. It is just so Donna can get through these introductions.</P>
					<P>Here we are after a number of years with work place drug testing, asking many 
						questions. I have been asked to sort of give an overview this morning about 
						some of the various technologies and things you are going to hear in greater 
						detail.</P>
					<P>I am going to talk a bit about what the core subject for the several days will 
						be, alternative technologies and some of the factors that are supporting just 
						general information about what they are and some notations about them.</P>
					<P>First, there are a few things to focus in on this conference. Dr. Cone asked you 
						some of them.</P>
					<P>We are going to be looking at, I think, research. Good researchers must doubt 
						even the most widely accepted premises.</P>
					<P>If we take this as a guiding light for the rest of the week, although I am going 
						to show you some general information that might show some preconceived ideas, I 
						think the idea here is to go through the next few days with an open mind.</P>
					<P>Second, we have to transfer scientific information in a credible manner. The 
						fact that there are various points of view, communication and the ability to 
						both transmit and understand these scientific principles is somewhat paramount.</P>
					<P>If we think these things -- and if you remember nothing else, there are these 
						two cartoons and I have three at the end -- you can figure out what is in 
						between.</P>
					<P>In general, though, we need to look at a variety of things and Ed has already 
						talked about a few of them.</P>
					<P>Also, let me point out that all the slides I have are in the handout. Some of 
						them I may not use in the interest of time, or go through them fairly quickly.</P>
					<P>These are the specimens that we are here to talk about. I have blood on this 
						slide. It is not one that we are going to be talking about, but it is sort of a 
						point of comparison. So, there is some information on the handout, looking at 
						some of the same characteristics for blood.</P>
					<P>The characteristics that were looked at, or need to be looked at when you 
						consider these things, include physiology, pharmacology, which drugs can be 
						detected in the medium, the various collection methodologies, testing 
						methodologies.</P>
					<P>I am going to talk about what the current uses are, and how that may change, the 
						accuracy of testing, scientific acceptability, litigation, risk, cost, 
						advantages and disadvantages. So, within the handout, there is a 
						characteristics slide on each one of these elements for each of the types of 
						technologies, and I am going to be talking a little bit more about each of 
						those.</P>
					<P>There are some caveats. You have to have a disclaimer before you do any of this 
						before such a wide group.</P>
					<P>I am going to try to give you a very rapid overview of the state of testing. 
						What you are going to hear and what is in the handout are some contemporary 
						notations that are the result of a report that I, with Dr. Cone, prepared for 
						HHS at the end of last year.</P>
					<P>It has the same ideas coming along as to where these things might be going, what 
						do we know today, what are the various thoughts.</P>
					<P>So, the idea is that this is to serve as the basis for the meeting going 
						forward. I am going to make the disclaimer that there are some statements in 
						there that a lot of people may disagree or not agree upon, and others may agree 
						very favorably with.</P>
					<P>The idea is that they are presented as one liners, as thought processes, as 
						thoughts that are held by some or many people in the relevant community. So, 
						there are some caveats in what we do.
					</P>
					<P>First of all, briefly in the way of background -- and Ed has mentioned a little 
						bit about this -- there is some different physiology. The types of specimens 
						and substances that we can deal with have some different characteristics.</P>
					<P>We are well aware of urine, production by the kidneys, the volume and the fact 
						that there is a stabilization of that and a validation following creatinine and 
						the ability to eliminate creatinine. Hair, on the other hand, is a solid-type 
						substance, has a fixed growth rate. It is going to be around for a much longer 
						period of time. It has a crystalline structure. It can deteriorate, also, with 
						age.</P>
					<P>Blood, by way of comparison, is really the most dynamic of all the specimens. It 
						is not used, or has not been used for a number of reasons.</P>
					<P>If one wants to make assessments about intoxication, impairment, cause of death, 
						blood is the fundamental specimen.</P>
					<P>It is stable in the body. Its volume changes very slowly. Therefore, it gives us 
						dynamic representation of what is going on, has a fairly fixed volume in the 
						body.</P>
					<P>Sweat is produced by eccrine glands. Its production, though, is highly dependent 
						upon environmental conditions.</P>
					<P>While it may follow or parallel a variety of drugs that are excreted, the 
						ability to collect sweat has been a problem until recently.</P>
					<P>It is mostly water. As you can see, the blood has got a lot of protein 
						substances, and the urine has a lot of other substances, and is also mostly 
						water, but sweat is almost 100 percent water.</P>
					<P>The last of the ones that we are going to talk about -- saliva -- is secreted by 
						various glands in the body.</P>
					<P>Its flow is dependent upon neurotransmitter stimulation, and the flow does vary 
						widely.</P>
					<P>Saliva composition is dependent upon flow. If you want to come and pair off 
						these specimens, saliva is one that might parallel blood in some regards and is 
						the closest one that might be utilized for determination of impairment 
						purposes, whereas each of the specimens -- I think that is what the purpose of 
						the rest of the meeting will be -- may allow us to do something different, to 
						ask and answer a different question.</P>
					<P>In science, as you all know, it is not the information that you get, it is the 
						question that you ask. If you ask the right question, then the information that 
						the test can produce can be used validly.</P>
					<P>If you ask the wrong question, it can be misinterpreted. So, in the end, asking 
						the right question and getting an answer that is useful is the goal of what we 
						are all going to try to do in the next few days.</P>
					<P>I am going to now kind of quickly go through the various specimens or 
						technologies with a bent on comparing them to each other along the lines that I 
						mentioned earlier.</P>
					<P>The drugs that can be tested in urine, we have extensive knowledge, as you all 
						know, regulated tests. There are the five major analytes with the a couple of 
						other drugs like 6-acetyl morphine.</P>
					<P>Other drugs, the NRC and the military have included barbiturates, benzos, LSD 
						from time to time. In the non-regulated arena, barbiturates, benzos, 
						propoxyphene, methadone, methaqualone and LSD have also been included.</P>
					<P>So, the drugs which are detectable have been clearly identified, and you will 
						find that there are many similarities throughout the various matrices.</P>
					<P>With laboratory based collection for urine, we rarely see observed collections. 
						We are generally dealing with non-observed collections. It is the common 
						practice.</P>
					<P>There is a concern about limiting adulteration or substitution. We do collect 
						about 60 milliliters of a specimen into a particular container.</P>
					<P>We are using, as Ed described, custody control form documented processes, and we 
						are commonly now today using split specimens.</P>
					<P>I want to point out also, before I go further with this, that this might be a 
						little more difficult to visualize here.</P>
					<P>The best way to look at this might be as a matrix when you compare them. But it 
						doesn't really fit too well on slides, to put multiple specimens across. So, I 
						am kind of forced to do one at a time. With regard to the various types of 
						testing on laboratory based urine, again, as you know, regulatory testing, 
						screening by enzyme immunoassay followed by GC/MS confirmation is mandated.</P>
					<P>Non-regulated laboratory testing, they follow the same methodology, or it may be 
						different. A confirmation may or may not be included out of the regulated 
						arena, and adulteration testing is possible.</P>
					<P>There is much to be heard of concern with adulteration of specimens as we go 
						forward with new technologies.</P>
					<P>The current uses for laboratory based urine testing is widespread in the 
						implementation and function of the current drug testing programs.</P>
					<P>It is also used extensively, and has bene used for many years prior in treatment 
						in correction programs.</P>
					<P>The accuracy of this testing can be described as essentially, with the controls 
						and situations with MROs and all that have been put in place, regulated testing 
						is essentially 100 percent accurate.</P>
					<P>We have extensive, in regulated tests, we have extensive PT programs available, 
						multiple types, that have maintained a degree of credibility in maintaining the 
						accuracy.</P>
					<P>Non-regulated testing may be equally accurate. However, there is a choice as to 
						whether to include various mandatory requirements or not.</P>
					<P>Procedures utilized, screening without confirmation does occur. When in that 
						arena, they are subject to some false positives.
					</P>
					<P>So, we do have a type of testing with the current laboratory based urine which 
						can be highly accurate if properly practiced.</P>
					<P>It is practiced very widely inside and outside this arena, where you might have 
						some diversion from that kind of activity. Scientific acceptability with regard 
						to the current process,
					</P>
					<P>we have a vast body of scientific literature addressing all aspects of urine 
						testing.</P>
					<P>I guess 10 years ago when a lot of these things started one would have said, 
						urine is just not that important and we don't need to know that much about it.</P>
					<P>Most of the previous forensic work was based on blood and tissues and other 
						specimens.</P>
					<P>I have to say, in the last 10 years we have done an awful lot of research. Every 
						day, it seems like every couple of months a new technical scientific issue 
						arises with regard to a specimen that maybe 10 or 15 years ago we would have 
						almost discarded, as being relevant and having a lot of science surrounding it.</P>
					<P>Properly conducted and evaluated urine tests are accepted and effectively 
						utilized. That is the key underlying statement for what is going on this week.</P>
					<P>Then an ultimate question is, are there other technologies or situations that 
						can be equally accepted and equally effectively utilized.</P>
					<P>This surrounds also the fact that we have passed the legal scrutiny with regard 
						to urine testing, that has been generally upheld in various court cases, and 
						urine testing has been documented.</P>
					<P>In the many years that we have been doing it now, it has not been adversely 
						affected.</P>
					<P>In a summary of the urine specimen, here are some of the advantages to using 
						laboratory based urine. Drugs and metabolites are highly concentrated. That is 
						why we use the specimen in the first place.</P>
					<P>There is a high propensity to find and detect these substances with conventional 
						techniques. The drugs, particularly through their metabolites, are there.</P>
					<P>The specimen can be obtained without physical risk to the donor. The main reason 
						that blood is not widely utilized is the concerns for obtaining the blood 
						specimen.</P>
					<P>There is an extensive scientific basis now for the testing methodology. It has 
						been utilized in many labs and documented extensively.</P>
					<P>PT testing is liberally practiced. Results are frequently and regularly accepted 
						in court.</P>
					<P>As Ed had pointed out -- this is one of the over-riding things in looking at the 
						other technologies -- we do have uniform testing criteria and well established 
						cut offs.</P>
					<P>We may want to change them for different reasons, but they have been well 
						established and are documented.</P>
					<P>We have methods which are of a commercial nature which are easily available so 
						we can utilize these. We do have tests that are FDA approved as part of this 
						process. There are many advantages to dealing with urine.</P>
					<P>Some of the disadvantages, though, and things that might be of concern, is that 
						the detection period is very short, two or three days.</P>
					<P>Recent research shows that for some of the drugs that may be even less than we 
						had originally anticipated, depending upon dose.</P>
					<P>There are no dose concentration relationships. We can't say a great deal about 
						exactly when the drug was used or what level of impairment there may be, if 
						that is desirable.</P>
					<P>Drug concentrations are greatly influenced by water intake.
					</P>
					<P>The amount of water that an individual ingests, particularly for certain drug 
						classes, will significantly affect the deductibility of those drugs.</P>
					<P>In your laboratory based urine, we do have a relatively time consuming process, 
						a laboratory based process with extensive laboratory costs.</P>
					<P>You have to build a laboratory, you have to have a lot of personnel, and there 
						is a fairly large cost involved with doing it.</P>
					<P>Those are some of the advantages and disadvantages of doing the urine laboratory 
						based.</P>
					<P>As the first other modality we could look at is on site testing. We have a 
						number of drugs which are fairly similar.</P>
					<P>Most of the common analytes are also available and we are reasonably certain 
						that, if there is a need, other ones could become available.</P>
					<P>This methodology is now single drug kits for single drugs one at a time, 
						multiple kits and various combinations thereof.</P>
					<P>Some of the kits, because of the clinical application, do include one drug class 
						anyway, tricyclates, which are not generally included in abused drugs.</P>
					<P>This technology includes all the drugs and can probably be easily modified, 
						because you are going to end up using the same antibodies and things that you 
						use for other laboratory based urine testing, and just put them in kit form. 
						So, the drugs would be similar.
					</P>
					<P>Collection methodology would also be similar. The only difference here is that 
						we would need to consider the acceptability of having results readily available 
						to the collector.</P>
					<P>In fact, if that is deemed acceptable, then there is probably going to be no 
						difference. That will happen. We know that if we do an on-site test, that 
						result is going to be immediately available.
					</P>
					<P>There are kits which actually use the collection and testing devices 
						simultaneously. So, there are a lot of novel items in the technology which 
						could be very useful with on-site technology.</P>
					<P>Right now split specimens are not common. Again, that could be altered very 
						readily if necessary.</P>
					<P>So, we have a collection methodology which is similar to the laboratory based, 
						with the exception of the identification of the various subjects to the 
						collector.</P>
					<P>The methodologies are, again, basically immunoassays. Some have -- and I think 
						Ed mentioned this -- built in controls.</P>
					<P>We do have to consider, as we go forward, how you would really quality control 
						such a program. There is some controversy, I think, about the built-in 
						controls, actually only monitoring the reagents as opposed to monitoring the 
						process.</P>
					<P>There is minimum space required, though, compared to a laboratory.</P>
					<P>Some of these processes are temperature dependent. While you use these kits, the 
						temperature in which they are used could affect the timing and the outcome.</P>
					<P>At least right now adulteration testing, which would still be difficult, in the 
						laboratory based there can be other things done, other tests with the specimen 
						when it gets to the laboratory.</P>
					<P>The kits themselves, at least the way they are currently configured, do not lend 
						themselves toward any adulteration testing and we will have the same types of 
						specimens, whether it is laboratory based or on site, and the same propensity 
						for alteration or adulteration of the specimen. So, that would be an issue.</P>
					<P>Current use, fairly limited for work place purposes, although there are some 
						mostly used in treatment and correction programs, and certainly used 
						extensively in hospital emergency rooms and other arenas outside the work place 
						arena.</P>
					<P>Accuracy, some comments on accuracy. HHS regulated and common non-regulated 
						analytes are all available.</P>
					<P>Adequate procedures are not developed to ensure reliability. So, right now we do 
						have kits out there. While most of them are FDA approved, although some in the 
						forensic arena might not require FDA approval, there is some lack of uniformity 
						amongst the products.</P>
					<P>There is a concern, I think, about the end point determination being subjective 
						in nature. When you read these things, I think all the kits except one read a 
						positive by the absence of color. Color goes away.</P>
					<P>When using kits, one has to be concerned about visual acuity, color blindness. 
						The kits that are out there today have a lot of variability in their end 
						points.</P>
					<P>It is not that this isn't correctable. I think this is due, at least at this 
						time principally, to the fact that we have a situation in which there are not 
						rules.</P>
					<P>When you make rules, manufacturers are able to adapt better. Right now there is 
						variation in the detection end points and there is a lot of variation in cut 
						off concentrations and how those concentrations actually operate.</P>
					<P>So, we have a group of devices out there which we will hear a lot more about, 
						which require principally more individual concern as to the assessment of the 
						end result, and some variability as to the concentrations that are detected.</P>
					<P>With on-site testing and scientific acceptability, they have not generally been 
						used for forensic purposes. They are not supported at this time by any real 
						court experience, and there is a relatively limited body of scientific 
						literature.</P>
					<P>That is not to say that there is not a large body of scientific literature about 
						urine in general, but about the actual application or applicability of the 
						various test kits to these processes, there is limited publication.</P>
					<P>There is obviously some publication on the initial evaluation of the kits in 
						comparison to their deductibility in a patient population, but that is not too 
						extensive at this time.</P>
					<P>The summary there, the advantages of on-site urine are fairly similar in many 
						respects to urine in general.</P>
					<P>Laboratory based, drugs and metabolites are highly concentrated, specimens can 
						be obtained without physical risk.</P>
					<P>The testing can be performed with non-scientific personnel.
					</P>
					<P>That would be an additional advantage to this technology.</P>
					<P>Minimal space and resources are required. That would be another pretty distinct 
						advantage and we don't have to build a laboratory to do these things.</P>
					<P>The other major advantage are the rapid turn around time of the test results, 
						which could be desirable in any number of settings. Again, most all of these 
						kits, except the ones that are only in a certain forensic arena, are approved 
						by the FDA.</P>
					<P>So, we do have a number of modalities which would make this very attractive.Some 
						of the disadvantages of on-site urine, again, are similar to urine in general 
						-- the detection period, the dose concentration relationship, the water 
						relationship.</P>
					<P>The other major ones on the bottom, the presumptive results may be acted upon 
						inappropriately. So if one is to use this in a regulated structured arena, 
						there have to be means to ensure that presumptive results are dealt with 
						appropriately.</P>
					<P>There is a possibility to compromise objectivity, from the collection process, 
						since the individual doing the test may have access to the result.</P>
					<P>The scientific basis, it is not as definitively established; that is to say, the 
						actual use of these kits around cut offs, et cetera.
					</P>
					<P>It has not generally been accepted yet for forensic purposes. Uniform testing 
						criteria cut offs have not been established, although there are a lot of claims 
						that there are various cut offs, that they meet certain criteria. Again, these 
						have not been uniformly decided upon and tested.</P>
					<P>There is, essentially, no performance testing program available, except that 
						which a particular manufacturer might offer. There is no centralized 
						performance testing program in on-site testing.
					</P>
					<P>The third substance which can be looked at for acceptability and the possibility 
						of testing for drugs is hair.</P>
					<P>Again, a wide variety of drugs have been detected in hair. All the common drugs 
						of abuse, including heroin, 6-acetyl morphine, actually a preponderance of the 
						ability to find the parent drug in hair has been demonstrated.</P>
					<P>Other drugs, metals, over the time period have also been detected.</P>
					<P>So, the methodology and the various drugs have been established and shown to be 
						present in hair. So, we can find the same drugs we are interested in, in 
						different varying amounts.</P>
					<P>Collection methodology as compared to urine would be substantially different. We 
						are cutting hair usually at the scalp surface, at the vertex at the back of the 
						head, and you can measure and document the length from the root to the tip out.</P>
					<P>The hair can be stored in protective containers. It can readily be shipped to 
						laboratories. Hair from other parts of the body can also be utilized.</P>
					<P>We have a large source in the human body of hair. We have the ability to detect 
						the drugs. We have some ease in getting the specimens from the collection sites 
						to various laboratories for testing.
					</P>
					<P>The methodologies, some comments here. The parent drug is often present, which 
						is pretty different from urine situations.</P>
					<P>Few laboratories are currently available that routinely test hair. Again, if 
						there is an acceptance of this technology this could rapidly change.</P>
					<P>Specially adapted amino acids are currently used for screening, GC/MS for 
						confirmation.</P>
					<P>One of the major points, I think, for hair testing is that it is laboratory 
						based and we may need more sophisticated equipment to really go to appropriate 
						sensitivity levels, as has been demonstrated by the need for tandem mass spec 
						in order to really be able to appropriately detect cannabinoids.</P>
					<P>So, the conventional laboratory that is doing urine testing would have to, to be 
						doing hair testing, would have to be a little bit more sophisticated and some 
						more costly equipment involved.</P>
					<P>The methodology is essentially there and I think it has been extensively looked 
						at and adapted in the arenas that are practicing it.
					</P>
					<P>Current use, a lot in the gaming industry, mostly for pre-employment testing. 
						There has been limited use in the work place, although some.</P>
					<P>There has been some utilization in other investigations, particularly death 
						investigations where other specimens are not available and prior drug exposure 
						is an issue. It has been used in other forensic investigations. There are 
						possibilities for use in various arenas with hair.</P>
					<P>Accuracy, with regard to hair, there are currently no proficiency testing 
						programs that exist. There have been some attempts at round robin testing with 
						the limited laboratories. I think there are some external services that provide 
						a type of specimens to laboratories performing this.</P>
					<P>So, there is an attempt at that process, but there are no structured proficiency 
						programs at this time.</P>
					<P>There are some variations in analytical results. The matrix itself is not 
						uniform. One could argue there is a benefit in an attempt to measure time with 
						long enough hair.</P>
					<P>On the other hand, if you take a random sample or a sample from a fixed portion 
						of the hair or fixed length, as compared to other places, the matrix is 
						somewhat different, the deposition may be different. There is a lack of clear 
						uniformity there.</P>
					<P>There have been some NIST surveys -- this round robin -- where some false 
						negatives and false positives have been reported.</P>
					<P>While this technology is clearly -- while it clearly has possibilities, there is 
						clearly some concern from this point of view.
					</P>
					<P>Scientific acceptability, there are some controversial aspects not resolved. How 
						the drugs got into hair is an issue. Interpretation, dose, time relationships 
						not established, ethnic bias has been of concern. The feasibility of marijuana 
						testing is somewhat uncertain depending upon laboratory capability.</P>
					<P>The advantages of hair, longer estimate of time of drug use.
					</P>
					<P>That is a distinct advantage. Ease of obtaining, storing and shipping of 
						specimen, low risk of disease transmission in the handling of samples. In the 
						second specimen, one can go back to the hair and get another specimen and test 
						it.</P>
					<P>Disadvantages of hair, inability to detect recent drug use. It takes a while for 
						the drugs to go into the hair. So, if it is very recent use, that is an issue.</P>
					<P>The bias of color, ethnic origin and sex needs to be resolved or dealt with. The 
						limited number of laboratories able to do this service is a disadvantage at 
						this time.</P>
					<P>Also, there is the possibility of an environmental contamination for some drug 
						biases, lack of PT, and these procedures are not FDA approved.</P>
					<P>I have in the handout -- I am going to skip through this.
					</P>
					<P>This is just for comparison, some points about blood.</P>
					<P>Blood is not really one of the things we are going to be looking at. So, I am 
						going to skip through these. I put them in there mostly because they were in 
						the report and they would allow you to compare some of the specimens to a 
						dynamic specimen which has been widely utilized in the scientific community for 
						therapeutic drug monitoring and for post mortem assessments.</P>
					<P>In quick summary, some of the advantages are that you can interpret these 
						behavioral relationships that many of the other specimens don't allow. There is 
						a large data base of information.</P>
					<P>The major disadvantage is that there aren't set cut off concentrations, and the 
						concentrations of the analyte are generally much lower and the time of 
						detection is also much lower.</P>
					<P>Let's look at the last two, sweat and saliva. There is a little bit less to say 
						about them from the data base.</P>
					<P>Again, we can identify, in sweat, many of the same drugs.
					</P>
					<P>In addition, alcohol is going to be excreted in the sweat. If you collect it for 
						drug testing purposes, it is obviously going to evaporate.</P>
					<P>The collection methodology, we have the sweat patch which is now available. So, 
						there is now a technology to actually collect this in a documented fashion. 
						Before it was much more difficult.</P>
					<P>This can be worn for days to weeks, and it can be readily sent to laboratories.</P>
					<P>The testing has been limited but essentially follows the same conventional 
						immunoassay and GC/MS methods, and we do have the capacity to find the parent 
						drug here.</P>
					<P>The current use is mostly in the criminal justice system. There is interest in 
						the use of this in the general treatment community.
					</P>
					<P>There are no PT programs. The sweat patch is approved by the FDA and there has 
						been a limited scientific evaluation and some publications on that.</P>
					<P>The advantages are that there seems to be high subject acceptability to wearing 
						this patch and a low incidence of allergic reactions.</P>
					<P>So, there is the ability to monitor drug intake for a period of weeks. It is a 
						relatively tamper proof and FDA approved product.
					</P>
					<P>In the arena that this exists, there are some good advantages to possibly using 
						it.</P>
					<P>Disadvantages, variation in sweat production. There are a limited number of 
						collection methods available. There is still high inter-subject variability. 
						Risk of removal, risk of contamination are issues that have to be dealt with if 
						we are going to use this for other purposes.</P>
					<P>Saliva, which is the final specimen, has again -- we can detect all the drugs. 
						You can also detect alcohol.</P>
					<P>There are some commercial devices available for collecting saliva. The parent 
						drug is frequently present. The immunoassay methods generally need to be 
						targeted to parent drug.</P>
					<P>This is another issue following one of the things Ed said, how the assays are 
						set up. If we are looking more at parent drug or the metabolite, that may 
						affect the nature and structure of some of the assays.</P>
					<P>Their reactivity, conventional confirmatory procedures can be utilized, and we 
						are looking at generally lower cut off concentrations.</P>
					<P>Saliva is not widely used. It is limited to the private sector for insurance 
						purposes. There is a device for alcohol. No PT programs.</P>
					<P>There have been a fair amount of things written about the scientific 
						acceptability of saliva, but mostly limited to purposes other than the work 
						place.</P>
					<P>The advantages, readily accessible for collection, may be related to behavioral 
						performance. This is probably the only other specimen that really has this 
						possibility.</P>
					<P>So, if we are really looking for recent drug use, it has some major advantages 
						there.</P>
					<P>Disadvantages, possibility of contamination by oral smoke, internasal routes. 
						The same disease collection concerns we have for other specimens, not FDA 
						approved.</P>
					<P>In the way of a summary here, urine laboratory based, we detect metabolites. We 
						are looking at a two to three day detection window. We have laboratory turn 
						around times to deal with. We are concerned about adulteration.</P>
					<P>On-site testing, also detects metabolites, same detection window. The major 
						difference there is we have a rapid turn around time.
					</P>
					<P>For those industries for which that is useful, that might be valid. Also, 
						adulteration concerns.</P>
					<P>Hair, detects parent drug, long detection window, generally months. We do still 
						have a laboratory turn around time and we still do have some concerns about 
						environmental contamination.</P>
					<P>Saliva detects the parent drug. There is a short detection window, less than a 
						day. But it has a rapid turn around time, on site.
					</P>
					<P>Contamination is possible. You can coincidentally do alcohol on the saliva 
						sample, if that is otherwise warranted.</P>
					<P>Sweat looks at both parent drug and metabolites. There is a long detection 
						window in the way of weeks. It is a lab turn around time and there are concerns 
						about variation in sweat production.</P>
					<P>These are the other three slides. This is where we are probably today, at the 
						beginning of this conference. We are down in the pits and we are going to look 
						at everything that is going to happen.
					</P>
					<P>Hopefully we will go up the ladder to come to some significant resolutions.</P>
					<P>This is a slide I have never had a chance to use before, but this did seem 
						appropriate. It says up here, this raging war with spears over there on the 
						left. I don't have time to talk to some salesman. He has got a battle to fight.</P>
					<P>Of course, I guess this guy has got the first model of the old gatling gun here. 
						That would be very significant, if we had time to stop and think about using it 
						appropriately, and I think that suggests this.</P>
					<P>Then finally, we have to make decisions. In reviewing the data, I think we need 
						to look at it objectively, and then ultimately decide which way we want to go, 
						for those of us who are able to do those things.</P>
					<P>Finally, the common parameters that we will be needing to develop as we go 
						through the rest of the week is to look at scientific acceptability, court 
						legal acceptability, community acceptability, whether these are FDA approved or 
						that is necessary, establishing cut offs, quality assurance and PT and the 
						cost/benefit to the various technologies.</P>
					<P>Hopefully, in an abbreviated amount of time, I gave you a rough overview or at 
						least my view of where some of the technologies are today and where we may be 
						going with them.</P>
					<P>With that, I will conclude and Donna won't have to put her second note up.</P>
					<P>(Applause.)</P>
					<P>DR. BUSH: Thank you very much. What a great kick off to this meeting. I am very, 
						very, very pleased with your attention on a Monday morning and the number of 
						you who showed up to join us for such a great kick off.</P>
					<P>Now, let me do some housekeeping things. There are a lot of people here, in case 
						you didn't notice. Everyone is going to want to get up and rush for the coffee.</P>
					<P>If you want to reclaim your seat, you may choose to leave your handout book 
						there. If you choose to do that, put your name on it. Okay, it is Monday, we 
						have to start slow. The coffee break will be out the back door of this 
						conference room. (Further housekeeping matters discussed.)</P>
					<P>On that note, it is about five after 10. We will take a 15minute break. We will 
						convene at 10:20. We are going to start on time because we have so much to 
						cover. Please join us back. Thank you.
					</P>
					<P>(Brief recess.)</P>
					<P>DR. BUSH: It is time to get started. That is the Monday morning crowd. They got 
						up, got a cup of coffee and walked around, and now they are very active.</P>
					<P>In order to kill a little bit of time while everybody is taking their seat again 
						and quieting down, I would like to take the opportunity to introduce myself to 
						those of you who don't know me.</P>
					<P>I know there are many friendly faces out there, Dr. Rohrig. Anyway, I would just 
						like to let you know how I fit into things, where I am and what I do for a 
						living.</P>
					<P>Since December of 1989, I have been the chief of the drug testing section in the 
						Division of Workplace Programs at the Center of Substance Abuse Prevention at 
						SAMHSA.</P>
					<P>I am responsible for planning and directing the National Lab Certification 
						Program administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.</P>
					<P>This certification program was established to ensure forensically and 
						technically sound drug testing of federal employees and employees of federally 
						regulated industries, such as the Department of Transportation and the Nuclear 
						Regulatory Commission.</P>
					<P>This effort directly supports the achievement of a drug free federal workplace 
						as ordered by the President, and covers more than 10 million employees.</P>
					<P>I am executive secretary of the Drug Testing Advisory Board, chartered to 
						provide guidance to the Secretary of the Department concerning drug testing 
						technology and policy implications.</P>
					<P>In my other life, I also serve as faculty for the American Society of Addiction 
						Medicine and the American Association of Medical Review Officers, to train 
						medical review officers in the review and interpretation of urine drug test 
						results.</P>
					<P>Additionally, I serve as faculty for the Florida School of Addiction Studies and 
						the Southeast School of Alcohol and other Drug Studies.</P>
					<P>Prior to this job, I served with the Department of Defense as Deputy Chief and 
						Technical Director of the U.S. Army Forensic Toxicology Drug Testing Laboratory 
						at Fort Meade, Maryland.</P>
					<P>I provided expert witness testimony and advice on drug testing issues for all 
						military agencies.</P>
					<P>I received a bachelors of science in chemistry from Loyola College in Baltimore, 
						a masters of science and medicinal chemistry from the University of Maryland at 
						Baltimore, a master of science in toxicology from the Johns Hopkins University 
						School of Hygiene and Public Health, and a doctorate of philosophy degree in 
						forensic toxicology from the University of Maryland at Baltimore School of 
						Medicine, where Dr. Caplan had a very easy time with me as his graduate 
						student.</P>
					<P>I am an active member of the Society of Forensic Toxicologists, I am a diplomate 
						of the American Board of Forensic Toxicologists, a fellow of the American 
						Academy of Forensic Sciences, and I have been nominated for inclusion in Who's 
						Who in Science and Technology.</P>
					<P>(Applause.)</P>
					<P>Now it is my pleasure to introduce Dr. Robert Willette. Dr. Willette has formed 
						DuoResearch in 1981 for the primary purpose of providing consulting services to 
						employers in the public and private sectors, on the design and implementation 
						of work place alcohol and drug programs.</P>
					<P>Dr. Willette has helped to establish policies, procedures, laboratory 
						inspections and blind quality control programs for the U.S. Navy, 
						Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, the Federal Bureau of Prisons, the 
						Drug Enforcement Administration, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and 
						numerous private companies.</P>
					<P>As chief of the Research Technology Branch of NIDA, Dr. Willette was responsible 
						for overseeing the federal proficiency testing programs for drug testing 
						laboratories conducted by the Centers for Disease Control from 1973 to 1981.</P>
					<P>At NIDA, Dr. Willette was also responsible for multiple studies on the 
						disposition of drugs in the body and their detection in biological specimens.</P>
					<P>In addition to these specific efforts directed toward quality control programs, 
						Dr. Willette is serving, or has served as a consultant on drug testing programs 
						to the White House Office of Drug Abuse Policy, the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Army, 
						NIDA, Federal Aviation Administration, Federal Railroad Administration, 
						National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the Postal Service, the DEA, 
						FBI, Customs Service; in other words, pretty much most of the federal agencies.</P>
					<P>This included the development and administration of the National Lab 
						Certification Program for HHS, for which he currently serves as a certified 
						inspector.</P>
					<P>Dr. Willette received a bachelor of science in pharmacy from Ferris Institute, 
						now Ferris State University, and a doctor of philosophy degree in medicinal 
						chemistry from the University of Minnesota.</P>
					<P>He has held research appointments at Upjohn, University of Michigan, Australian 
						National University, and the Commonwealth and Scientific Research Organization 
						of Australia.</P>
					<P>He has served on faculties in schools of pharmacy at Ferris State and the 
						University of Connecticut.</P>
					<P>Dr. Willette, I will turn this panel over to you and adjourn to the back, and 
						good luck to you, sir.</P>
					<P>Agenda Item: Specimen Collection/Chain of Custody Panel.</P>
					<P>DR. WILLETTE: Thank you very much, Donna.</P>
					<P>It is appropriate that the first panel address the first step and subsequent 
						steps in handling the specimens that are going to be tested.</P>
					<P>Prior to 1981, most drug testing was done in the context of drug treatment 
						programs, whether it was in the work place, the private sector, criminal 
						justice or the military.</P>
					<P>The process that was used to collect specimens and to handle specimens and 
						throughout the entire process and the data followed fairly traditional clinical 
						chemistry practices.</P>
					<P>Because there was not strict control over the identification of who provided the 
						specimen or the handling of the specimen in the laboratory with literally 
						hundreds of people that had access to them, many errors occurred. Many people 
						received false laboratory results.</P>
					<P>The consequences of that were minimized by the fact that generally for the 
						purposes that the testing was being conducted, that severe consequences didn't 
						occur.</P>
					<P>Usually people were either extended in the treatment and so forth.</P>
					<P>That all changed in 1981 when two events happened in sort of conflicting motion. 
						The Department of Health and Human Services got out of the laboratory 
						proficiency and laboratory inspection and monitoring business, but the military 
						got into it.</P>
					<P>The military embarked upon a massive random testing program of military 
						personnel. This prompted the necessity to develop a totally new system for 
						conducting drug tests.</P>
					<P>This was to merge together the high volume clinical practices with forensic 
						principles. That emerged slowly during the early 1980s, spreading into other 
						federal agencies, into the private sector, and then culminating in the 
						development and implementation of the federal mandatory guidelines for federal 
						work place programs in 1988.</P>
					<P>Those looked at all of these critical steps which Dr. Cone has outlined.</P>
					<P>It seems only appropriate to then bring together the people that have played 
						critical roles in this. Some of you may notice uniforms in the audience.</P>
					<P>There are at least eight people who are presenters over these days from that 
						military background. They played a critical role in the evolution of this whole 
						system.</P>
					<P>The panelists that we have to start off with on collection and chain of custody 
						represent views from each of the major subject areas that are the focus of this 
						three-day hearing.</P>
					<P>I have been told by the organizers that the order in which these areas are 
						covered have been randomly selected throughout each of the different panels.</P>
					<P>Just to prove that the lottery works, it seems most appropriate that the system 
						selected our first speaker.</P>
					<P>Dr. Michael Walsh was, in one of his many roles in the government, the person at 
						the point at the lead and responsible for the development of, and the 
						implementation of the mandatory guidelines and the national certification 
						program.</P>
					<P>Dr. Walsh is currently the president of the Walsh group, which is a research and 
						consulting firm located in Bethesda, with the focus on providing consulting 
						services and substance abuse policy research in this field, and certainly the 
						technology.</P>
					<P>From 1989 to 1993, Dr. Walsh served as the executive director of the President's 
						Drug Advisory Council in the Executive Office of the President.</P>
					<P>He also acted as the associate director of the Office of the National Drug 
						Policy Control.</P>
					<P>Prior to those appointments, Mike was the director of the Division of Applied 
						Research at the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and served in many 
						capacities, overseeing the development of drug policy, drug effects on 
						performance and driving, drug testing programs, employee assistance programs 
						and in AIDS treatment research.</P>
					<P>Prior to joining NIDA, Dr. Walsh was a scientist, a civilian scientist with the 
						Naval Medical Research Institute in Bethesda, where he conducted and oversaw 
						research in various aspects of the effects of drugs on human performance, the 
						areas of psychopharmacology, behavioral toxicology and hyperbaric medicine.</P>
					<P>When Mike came to NIDA, he went from studying the effects of drugs on diving to 
						studying the effects of drugs on driving. So, all we had to do is stick an R in 
						that title.</P>
					<P>Dr. Walsh received his doctoral degree in psychology here in town, the American 
						University, in 1973. He is licensed to practice in the state of Maryland.</P>
					<P>He has published more than 60 articles, books and chapters in various research 
						publications, and has been in demand as an invited speaker at many, many 
						conferences and meetings.</P>
					<P>With no further ado, I am going to turn this over to Michael and start his 
						timer.</P>
					<P>DR. WALSH: Thanks very much, Bob. Bob and I worked together on the drugs and 
						driving program at NIDA, and co-edited the WHO document.</P>
					<P>Although they translated it into Spanish and French and German and I think 
						Russian, they played it as if it was a new publication every year. So, we had 
						about seven or eight citations from that one publication.</P>
					<P>They haven't done anything since, in a long time. It is about time to do it 
						again.</P>
					<P>I would like to congratulate Dr. Autry and the staff of the Division of 
						Workplace Programs and the Drug Testing Advisory Board for their leadership in 
						convening this conference to examine alternative specimens and technology.</P>
					<P>I would like to just say a few personal words about Joe Autry. As Joe's 
						predecessor, I became acutely aware of the fact that no matter how hard you 
						work, how professional you are, you still can't please everybody all the time.</P>
					<P>As a result of this, there are times when it gets real personal in terms of some 
						of the criticisms of the way in which you are running the program.</P>
					<P>When I took the bull's eye off my chest and gave it to Joe, I was delighted to 
						get rid of it, but I think that Joe deserves a lot of credit for wearing that 
						bull's eye with pride and a lot of professionalism.</P>
					<P>The mandatory guidelines for the federal workplace program were originally 
						drafted in 1986. While science was the guiding principle, or the basic 
						philosophy by which we developed the guidelines, much of the details were 
						driven by legislative mandates and legal concerns of that time, of the middle 
						1980s.</P>
					<P>Nearly 10 years have passed now since the final implementation. I really believe 
						that federal scientists and policy makers now need to be open to new technology 
						and new methods.</P>
					<P>I think a desirable goal would be to incorporate the new advances in technology, 
						to make drug testing programs more efficient and more cost effective without 
						sacrificing any scientific integrity.</P>
					<P>With regard to the on site technologies, I believe there is a need in many work 
						place settings to have the capability for rapid screening -- fitness for duty, 
						pre-performance testing, safety sensitive, post-accident, incidence and so on 
						-- where negative specimens could be rapidly separated from those needing 
						further laboratory evaluation.</P>
					<P>I believe that on-site technology has reached the point where it is feasible to 
						produce accurate and reliable results, and that procedures can be established 
						to utilize this technology within a forensic program.</P>
					<P>Over the next two days, the speakers representing the on-site technologies will 
						attest to the fact that on-site urinalysis procedures, the methods, the 
						reagents, internal and external quality control, confirmation procedures, and 
						reporting of test results, really vary little from that which is currently 
						mandated in the federal guidelines.</P>
					<P>For example, with regard to specimen collections, maintaining the integrity of 
						the specimen at the collection site, specimen chain of custody and control, we 
						really believe that standard procedures as described in the HHS guidelines can 
						and should be followed, whether the test is conducted on site or sent on to a 
						lab.
					</P>
					<P>Now, Dr. Vogel said all of that was nice but he wasn't going to let me get away 
						with just saying we ought to use the HHS guidelines. He asked me to be a little 
						bit more specific. Preparation,
					</P>
					<P>I think, and set up of a collection site is a key to minimizing the problems in 
						specimen collection.</P>
					<P>These procedures are really no different whether the specimen is analyzed on 
						site or sent to a lab. You have got to limit access to water and other 
						potential dilutants.</P>
					<P>You have got to put some dye in the toilets to inhibit adulteration. You need to 
						check photo ID of the donor.</P>
					<P>You need to have the individual remove excess clothing. It is good to provide 
						some kind of security for the contents of pockets or a purse.</P>
					<P>The temperature of the specimen has to be assessed, and the collector is going 
						to have to check the color and the order at an absolute minimum of the 
						specimen, to deal with the issues that Dr. Caplan so clearly laid out.</P>
					<P>Properly trained collection personnel is also key. Training for collectors 
						should include education about site preparation, about the responsibilities of 
						a collection site person, ensuring how to ensure specimen security and chain of 
						possession.</P>
					<P>Collectors need to be trained about specimen substitution issues, dilution and 
						adulteration, laboratory and medical review officer procedures, and proper 
						completion of the chain of custody and control forms.</P>
					<P>In addition, there are additional responsibilities if the collector is going to 
						be the on-site testing person. They have got to be familiar with the package 
						insert information for any device that is going to be used on site.</P>
					<P>They should be required to at least have observed a manufacturers training 
						video. They should be required to perform a number of tests and interpret the 
						test results under supervision.</P>
					<P>Some of the clients we have dealt with actually have a second person 
						interpreting the results and signing off on the chain of custody, so that the 
						one single individual cannot be so easily compromised.</P>
					<P>If you are going to be an on-site testing person, you need to be trained to 
						develop a standard operating procedure and so on.</P>
					<P>In terms of the actual collection, it may differ, depending on the type of 
						device to be used. Some devices allow for testing within the collection cup, 
						while others require an aliquot for on-site testing.
					</P>
					<P>For devices which permit testing within the cup, without introducing any kind of 
						a foreign body into the urine specimen, there aren't any really special 
						procedures that are required.</P>
					<P>A standard chain of custody can be completed while the test is running. When the 
						test is completed, the cup can be sealed with tamper evidence seals, and the 
						donor dismissed with his or her copy of the form.</P>
					<P>The test results can then be read, and with a positive, the sealed specimen 
						should be shipped off to the laboratory. Negatives should be disposed of and 
						results reported out.</P>
					<P>For devices which require pipetting of specimen or introducing something into 
						the specimen, I would recommend that an aliquot be poured off and the remainder 
						of the specimen sealed for shipment, and the chain of custody initiated.</P>
					<P>Typically in a lot of cases people use a disposable cup anyway, and then fill 
						two smaller bottles to be shipped to the lab.
					</P>
					<P>I would suggest that all of that be done prior to the specimen being analyzed. 
						If it is a positive on site, the specimen to be sent to the lab are already 
						sealed and ready to go.</P>
					<P>In terms of maintaining chain of custody and control, I believe the chain of 
						custody should be initiated for every specimen, bar coding or some form of 
						coding should be used to label the sealed specimen and any aliquot used for 
						on-site testing.</P>
					<P>All specimens testing positive should be sent to a certified lab for further 
						evaluation.</P>
					<P>In terms of copies of control forms, I believe every donor should get a copy. 
						The collection site should maintain a copy. Negatives, if it is a negative on 
						site test, the remaining copies can be returned to the referring agency. If it 
						is a positive onsite test, the standard procedure of sending the original to 
						the lab, copy to the MRO, and so on, would be done.</P>
					<P>The specifics of the on-site testing device is going to depend on the device. I 
						believe that typically the actual on-site test can be done after the chain of 
						custody is complete and the bottles are sealed.</P>
					<P>That way, it doesn't have to be done in view of the donor.
					</P>
					<P>If it is a positive, it is going to go on to the lab, all sealed and ready to 
						go.</P>
					<P>The Department of Transportation has established regulations for on-site 
						screening for alcohol. Criteria have been developed to evaluate test devices, 
						and they have established the conforming products list.</P>
					<P>I believe that similar standards can and should be established for on-site drug 
						testing devices, to evaluate sensitivity, specificity, precision around the cut 
						offs, and other variables, to determine suitability for incorporation in 
						federal programs.</P>
					<P>Model collection and screening test personnel and procedures for quality 
						assurance and quality control can also be established for using these devices, 
						as they have for on-site alcohol test devices in the DOT programs.</P>
					<P>I am going to give you a little time here, because I am going to summarize up by 
						saying that I think this meeting really represents a significant opportunity to 
						move the field of drug testing forward, and to broaden the application of 
						testing into these other areas where it is so badly needed, in which the 
						current system is either not feasible or too costly. Thank you all very much 
						for listening.
					</P>
					<P>(Applause.)</P>
					<P>DR. WILLETTE: Thank you, Michael. We have another Michael from the draw of the 
						hat that is going to follow.</P>
					<P>Dr. Michael Peat joined Lab One in Lenexa, Kansas in June of 1994 as the senior 
						vice president for toxicology, and currently serves in that capacity as the 
						executive vice president.</P>
					<P>In this role, he is responsible for the operation of the toxicology lab, as well 
						as the entire substance abuse sales force and client services of that facility.</P>
					<P>Prior to that, Dr. Peat was the vice president for toxicology for Roche 
						Biomedical Laboratories and CompuChem Laboratories. His previous experience is 
						with the metropolitan police forensics science lab at the new Scotland Yard in 
						London.</P>
					<P>He has had a long, interesting journey from London to Kansas, and yes, this is 
						Kansas.</P>
					<P>He served at the Center for Human Toxicology at the University of Utah and other 
						appointments, prior to joining Lab One. Dr. Peat has an undergraduate degree in 
						chemistry, a doctorate in pharmacology, and is certified by the American Board 
						of Forensic Toxicology, to which he presently serves as the director of that 
						board.</P>
					<P>He has been a member of this Drug Testing Advisory Board until 1994, and serves 
						as a consultant to the College of American Pathologists on their toxicology 
						resource committee.</P>
					<P>He is the author of many peer reviewed articles and book chapters, and is also 
						in demand as a speaker.</P>
					<P>Dr. Peat is going to talk to us about the chain of custody and collection 
						procedures surrounding that of saliva.</P>
					<P>DR. PEAT: Thank you, Bob. I had to move to Kansas. It was the only time zone I 
						hadn't lived in.</P>
					<P>I am going to talk today about saliva, for the next few minutes. Before I get 
						into the collection and chain of custody issues associated with it, I would 
						like to give you a little background as to saliva and what is currently being 
						done with saliva.</P>
					<P>It may come as a surprise to a number of you that there is a large amount of 
						saliva testing going on currently in some labs in this country.</P>
					<P>In fact, there is a lot of literature about saliva as Yale mentioned in his 
						talk. Over 10 years ago, in the first volume of the Advances in Analytical 
						Toxicology, Brian Cadey wrote a whole chapter on saliva testing for drugs, 
						including drugs of abuse.</P>
					<P>There is extensive literature available on saliva and what it means and how it 
						can be tested for.</P>
					<P>Saliva, however, is not common spit. We are not dealing with people spitting 
						into test tubes and sending common spit specimens to the lab.</P>
					<P>We are dealing with oral fluid. Even though I will revert to the term saliva 
						during the next two days, and I am sure the other speakers will use that term, 
						we don't necessarily mean that it is saliva. We really should refer to this as 
						oral fluid.</P>
					<P>There are several sophisticated collection devices -- one of which I will 
						describe in a few minutes -- available for the collection of saliva, that refer 
						more to that being an ultra-filtrate of plasma than being spit.</P>
					<P>It really is an ultra-filtrate of plasma mixed with the oral fluid in the mouth.</P>
					<P>Who has been testing saliva? Well, obviously the transportation sector is 
						allowed to test saliva for ethanol and there are NITSA approved devices for 
						that purposes, and a number of large transportation companies currently use 
						those.</P>
					<P>Laboratories in the risk assessment or the insurance testing business have been 
						testing saliva for a number of years.</P>
					<P>There are three such labs in Kansas City -- mine, Osborn
					</P>
					<P>Labs and Clinical Reference Labs. Two of those are NIDA/SAMHSA certified at this 
						point.</P>
					<P>There is extensive experience in testing saliva in the risk assessment business.</P>
					<P>There has been a small amount of testing for therapeutic drug monitoring 
						reasons. That is not commonly done today. Certainly there are research groups 
						that have focused on that, as there have been researchers focused on other 
						things in terms of testing saliva for drugs.</P>
					<P>Saliva has been FDA approved for HIV testing. That is obviously where the risk 
						assessment labs have focused their efforts.
					</P>
					<P>They also test saliva for creatinine and for cocaine metabolite. Several hundred 
						specimens a day are done for those three tests, in my lab and several hundred 
						more in other labs. So, again, there is extensive experience with saliva 
						testing.</P>
					<P>As I said earlier, there have been various reports on the detection of other 
						drugs of abuse.</P>
					<P>Really, when we look at the general guidelines for collecting saliva or 
						collecting bodily fluids such as saliva, they are the same as for urine.</P>
					<P>Dr. Cone described those protocols and the principles thereof in his first talk, 
						and I echo them for saliva.</P>
					<P>Correct collection, documentation, sealing, shipping specimens, et cetera, to 
						the lab, all those principles apply to the collection of saliva.</P>
					<P>The specimen collection would require a collector, not necessarily a 
						phlebotomist, but certainly a trained collector.</P>
					<P>A number of the insurance companies use insurance agents to collect saliva, 
						rather than paramedicals to do that job. So, you need training but you don't 
						need extensive training.</P>
					<P>Obviously, you can seal the specimens, ship them in bags or boxes to the labs 
						under chain of custody. That is currently being done today in the insurance 
						business, not necessarily to the degree of documentation that workplace testing 
						requires, but certainly the basic principles are there in terms of collection 
						of saliva today.</P>
					<P>This is one such device. This is the episcreen device manufactured by Epitope 
						from Oregon. If you can look at the top of the slide, you will see a little pad 
						on a stick.</P>
					<P>That little pad is put between the gum and the cheek and that is left there for 
						a period of time, inserted in the tube, which contains this fluid, then sealed. 
						Obviously bar coded seals can be used, labeled seals can be used, and then the 
						whole box containing this kit is shipped to the lab.</P>
					<P>Once at the lab, it is received and the documentation. That tube is spun down, 
						and certainly you can then go ahead and analyze the fluid that is collected 
						from that saliva collection or oral fluid collection.</P>
					<P>There are other collection devices available. They may not necessarily collect 
						the same type of fluid, but they are certainly focused on the same type of 
						principle.</P>
					<P>That is, they have basically been developed to test for HIV.
					</P>
					<P>So, they are going to collect the same type of fluids.</P>
					<P>In summary, although I refer to it as saliva, it is not saliva. It is oral 
						fluid. There is considerable experience available with certain types of 
						analytes, cocaine, creatinine, and in some cases other drugs of abuse.</P>
					<P>There are collection devices available commercially. Obviously, the guidelines 
						for collection and chain of custody, et cetera, are very similar, if not 
						identical, to the collection of urine specimens. Thank you.</P>
					<P>(Applause.)</P>
					<P>DR. WILLETTE: Thank you, Michael.Our next speaker is Neil Fortner. Neil joined 
						PharmChem Laboratories in 1991, and serves as the director and vice president 
						of laboratory operations.</P>
					<P>Prior to joining PharmChem, he also served as the director of toxicology at 
						another HHS certified forensic drug testing laboratory. Neil has had more than 
						15 years experience in forensic toxicology, and serves as the responsible 
						person at PharmChem for the laboratory certification, and also serves as an 
						inspector to that program and to the College of American Pathologists.</P>
					<P>He is a member of the American Society of Clinical Chemistry, the Society of 
						Forensic Toxicology and the American Academy of Forensic Sciences. He is a 
						member of the American Board of Forensic Examiners.</P>
					<P>As vice president and laboratory scientific director, Neil is responsible for 
						the technical quality and reliability of the test results. This includes the 
						whole of activities that have been described as essential for producing 
						forensic quality results in the laboratory.</P>
					<P>He has a bachelors degree in biology from Hiram College and a master's degree in 
						biology and biochemistry from Western Kentucky University.
					</P>
					<P>Neil is going to talk to us about the collection and chain of custody procedures 
						dealing with sweat.</P>
					<P>MR. FORTNER: I would like to first of all thank the Drug Testing Advisory Board 
						and Health and Human Services for the opportunity to look at new technologies 
						and new advancements as they may assist us in the war on drugs.</P>
					<P>The testing of sweat for drugs of abuse is not new. It goes back many, many 
						years.</P>
					<P>If you look at the literature, one of the things that has always limited that 
						forensic application is how do you collect the material itself.</P>
					<P>These are just some of the techniques that have been used in the past to collect 
						sweat. We are talking about different types of sweat here -- unsensible and 
						sensible sweat, as the primary mechanism of the body to cool itself.</P>
					<P>You can certainly go back and look at, in the literature, techniques using 
						capillary micropipettes, literally dripping, swabs or skin wipes.</P>
					<P>You get into some rather elaborate type of body bags, if you will, which could 
						present some rather interesting challenges in the collection procedure.</P>
					<P>What I am going to talk today about, and subsequent speakers in the day and a 
						half is not really designed to be a promotional item, per se.</P>
					<P>We are going to talk about an application that is generally termed the sweat 
						patch. As Dr. Caplan addressed in his previous introduction, it is one of the 
						mechanisms that is currently used to collect sweat for analysis for drugs 
						subject to abuse.</P>
					<P>Now, the property of the patch itself is what sort of lends itself to this 
						application. It is a film -- a polyurethane film -- which is over top of an 
						absorption pad.</P>
					<P>On top of the absorption pad is a unique identification number. Under that is a 
						release liner.</P>
					<P>The properties are such that if you look at it from a sandwich component, you 
						have the urethane film, a release liner, and then an absorption pad of medical 
						grade blotter paper.</P>
					<P>How does it work? Because of the properties of this urethane film, it actually 
						becomes a physical barrier. It will not allow environmental contaminants 
						through. This is based on the molecular pore size and also the structure of the 
						pad itself. It does allow water vapor, though, to be passed through the pad.</P>
					<P>Drugs, as they are deposited in the sweat, dissolved in that, then become 
						entrapped within the pad itself, and then you can subsequently remove the pad 
						for analysis.</P>
					<P>This is sort of the underlying principle of how this patch works. You have a 
						urethane film, an adhesive that is in there.</P>
					<P>The adhesive literally permeates the upper epithelial layers. This is one of the 
						properties we will talk about a little bit later in terms of a tamper evident 
						characteristic.</P>
					<P>As these cells infiltrate the adhesive and the pad or the patch is physically 
						removed, a layer of those cells come with it, which makes it very difficult to 
						reapply the patch.</P>
					<P>Now certainly as Dr. Caplan addressed, in the application, certain areas that 
						you want to be concerned about is going to be an external contamination issue.</P>
					<P>If an individual is involved in illicit drug activities, there is a high 
						likelihood that there could be illicit drugs on the skin itself.</P>
					<P>So, the first thing that you want to do is prepare a site for the application of 
						the patch. Now only does this physically remove possible contaminations, but it 
						also removes oils from the skin which are essential to get good adhesion.</P>
					<P>Following clean of the area -- typically it is with an isopropyl swab -- you can 
						then apply a patch. You can see it here in its component.</P>
					<P>There is a urethane film right here on the outside edge.
					</P>
					<P>This is the patch itself. This is a unique number within the upper layer.</P>
					<P>Simply by applying the patch to surface area and then physically applying 
						pressure around the absorbent pad itself you can then remove the outer window 
						frame and apply additional pressure throughout the rest of the upper layer.</P>
					<P>Now, this patch can be worn for a number of days, including up to several weeks 
						if desired. The reason we can do that is when you first initiate chain of 
						custody there is a recording of this unique patch identification number in 
						here.</P>
					<P>That chain of custody then is matched up to a bar code impregnated upon the 
						document itself. An individual can then leave, come back at a later time to be 
						set up, and remove the patch itself.
					</P>
					<P>In the removal process the first thing they are going to need to do is verify 
						that the patch number matches the chain of custody for the patch that was 
						originally applied.</P>
					<P>Certainly it is conceivable that somebody may try to physically remove the 
						patch, replace it with a counterfeit or other bar code, or replace it with 
						another patch, if they have access to that.</P>
					<P>So, verification of the patch number is rather critical, in terms of linking 
						that particular patch to that particular donor at a specific application time.</P>
					<P>Now in order to maintain this chain of custody, it is recommended that you have 
						the donor physically start to peel the polyurethane layer away.</P>
					<P>All they need to do is just peel the top part of it away to expose the patch 
						itself.</P>
					<P>As Dr. Caplan mentioned, one of the other issues can be external contamination. 
						So, if the individual is, again, involved in illicit drug use and they happen 
						to have drugs on their hand, it would be much better for them to remove the 
						upper layer.</P>
					<P>We would then take a disposable tweezers and just pull the pad itself out of the 
						patch dressing.</P>
					<P>This is then placed into a forensic sterile bag, would then remove appropriate 
						bar codes from the chain of custody which has already been initiated because it 
						would have recorded unique patch number, date of application, donor's identity.</P>
					<P>Proper documentation, bar code identification is very similar to the urine 
						process that is established under the HHS guidelines, using very similar chain 
						of custody, positive ID bar code.
					</P>
					<P>Again, it is analogous to the guidelines, removal of the tamper seals for 
						sealing the forensic bag. You can go through the same procedures, documentation 
						of donor signature or initials, collector initials and date, bar code on the 
						bag, bar code on the tamper seal.</P>
					<P>At that point in time, this sample is prepared and ready for shipment to any 
						centralized laboratory that can conduct this particular analysis. I thank you 
						for your time.</P>
					<P>(Applause.)</P>
					<P>DR. WILLETTE: Thank you, Neil. Our next presenter is Dr. Donald Kippenberger, 
						who serves as the vice president for laboratory operations and is laboratory 
						director at Psychemedics Corporation, which is a certified forensic drug 
						testing laboratory specializing in testing hair for drugs of abuse.</P>
					<P>Prior to joining Psychemedics, Dr. Kippenberger was with the U.S. Army. In his 
						last assignment in the army, after a long career in toxicology, he served as 
						consultant to the Army Surgeon General for forensic drug testing.</P>
					<P>He was the technical director of the drug testing program, and was the Army's 
						Surgeon General to the Department of Defense Drug Testing Advisory Board.
					</P>
					<P>Don Kippenberger received a doctorate in physical organic chemistry from Texas 
						A&amp;M University. He is going to talk to us about the collection and chain of 
						custody procedures involved in the testing of hair for drugs of abuse.</P>
					<P>DR. KIPPENBERGER: Thank you, Dr. Willette. I want to thank the Drug Testing 
						Advisory Board and Dr. Vogel for inviting me to coordinate this conference on 
						the hair portion.</P>
					<P>I hope in the time allotted, that we will be able to show the effectiveness of 
						hair testing in the work place environment.</P>
					<P>I have split my talk into two portions. The first is on the collection portion 
						and the second is on what happens to the sample when it gets to the laboratory 
						on a chain of custody.</P>
					<P>When I read what we were asked to do I felt that what happens to the sample 
						ultimately would be important.</P>
					<P>The first thing we do is we secure the collection area. Unlike some matrices, we 
						can use any environment we can find -- office area. It just has to be low 
						access for people to walk through.</P>
					<P>There are really no privacy concerns with collection of hair. People get their 
						hair cut in public all the time.</P>
					<P>This is a copy of a picture of our conference room. When you stop collecting 
						samples in this room, the room can go back to being used for what it was used 
						for originally.</P>
					<P>Then you gather the collection supplies. Various supplies we have, we have the 
						test request form here. We have a sample acquisition form, what we call a SAC 
						here. This is an envelope where we put the sample.</P>
					<P>There is some aluminum foil that we are going to put the sample in. We have a 
						pouch that we are going to seal the SAC and a copy of the TRF in.</P>
					<P>We have some alcohol swabs. The purpose of that is just for hygienic purposes, 
						to clean the scissors and the hair clip.</P>
					<P>Then we have to make sure that the person has signed a consent form, and also 
						that we have identified the subject.</P>
					<P>You can see here the subject has been identified with an ID and they are signing 
						the consent form at the same time.</P>
					<P>If there is no ID available, then we have to get someone from the company to 
						verify who the person is that we are testing.</P>
					<P>Then the next step is to complete the administrative data on the test request 
						form. Examples of administrative data is the MRO address, the client 
						information, which is usually typed in ahead of time, the collector's signature 
						and name and phone number so they can be contacted if needed, the subject ID of 
						the individual, where the hair is collected from if it becomes an issue in 
						interpretation, and then the chain of custody on the sample.</P>
					<P>Next is the administrative data on the SAC. What is on the SAC is a place for 
						the collector to actually sign, saying they collected the sample.</P>
					<P>There is a place for the subject ID and a date and time of collection.</P>
					<P>Then we can take the bar code, because each TRF is uniquely labeled with a 
						unique number, and place it from the TRF and put it onto the SAC, which you see 
						there.</P>
					<P>When you collect the hair, typically what you do is you take a hair clip and 
						lift up a portion of the hair on the back of the hair usually.</P>
					<P>You take about a half-inch-wide swatch of hair or lock of hair that is about one 
						layer of hair deep, and you cut it close to the skin. Here is an example of 
						that.</P>
					<P>Then keeping grasp of this lock of hair, you place the root end, which is the 
						end next to the skin where you cut, and you place it in the aluminum foil.</P>
					<P>Then you place it in a SAC and it is a little easier to see. You can see the 
						nice, even cut portion here that is being placed into the sample acquisition 
						card.</P>
					<P>Then you seal the SAC with an integrity seal, being shown there. Then the 
						collector initials and dates the security seal.</P>
					<P>The test subject then initials the SAC. They are prompted to read a statement. 
						The statement is -- my photographic memory is running out of batteries so I 
						have to read it:</P>
					<P>By these initials, I can certify that I am the test subject, that the test 
						sample contained in the envelope is my sample, and was cut close to the skin. I 
						witnessed the sample collector seal the sample in this envelope.</P>
					<P>Then the test subject completes the MRO portion of the form, which is -- it has 
						all the information that I mentioned before, but it also has a place for the 
						donor to sign their name, print their name, put their phone number so the MRO 
						can actually contact them.</P>
					<P>Then down in the portion right here, there is a place for the MRO when we send 
						them the result, to either accept the result, to call it positive or negative 
						depending on what the result was, or to cancel the test or to order another 
						test.</P>
					<P>Then the SAC and the top copy are placed in a pouch. The pouch is sealed. The 
						subject initials and dates are placed on the pouch.</P>
					<P>Therefore, at the point we are getting ready to ship in the lab, the individual 
						has now signed the collection devices twice, once on the pouch, once on the 
						sample, before it is even sent to the laboratory. Then it is sent to the lab.</P>
					<P>In hair collection, I wanted to point out to folks that this is a matrix where 
						the sample is in the complete view of the collector from the time the sample is 
						obtained to the point where it is mailed off to the laboratory.</P>
					<P>At the laboratory site in the chain of custody, I put this slide in to make sure 
						that if I don't say that we put things in temporary storage, or we perform 
						everything under chain of custody, we actually do.</P>
					<P>On the comments that Dr. Cone said on the lab, I did not look at his slides when 
						I prepared these. I agree 100 percent.</P>
					<P>The entire lab must be secure. Access to the lab must be tightly controlled and 
						documented. Visitors must be escorted, and accessioning and handling must be 
						limited access areas.</P>
					<P>The samples and the data must be handled with the same amount of control.</P>
					<P>In our chain of custody we use samples that are accessioned one at a time. The 
						person who opens the package dates and signs the air bill.</P>
					<P>The pouch is checked for an integrity seal when it is taken out of the Fed Ex 
						package, which is usually how we get our work, and the pouch is opened and the 
						SAC and the TRF are taken out.</P>
					<P>The subject identification number on the SAC and the TRF are compared, to make 
						sure also that the information also on both forms is complete.</P>
					<P>The bar code LAN label is placed on both the TRF and the SAC, and the tech 
						verifies the integrity of the SAC seal. Then the tech breaks the seal to make 
						sure there is hair present.</P>
					<P>Some of the reasons for invalidating hair samples, the subject initials are 
						missing, pretty obvious, no hair in the SAC -- it doesn't happen very often. 
						TRF is missing, that happens occasionally.
					</P>
					<P>Hair is from two body locations. I mean, head hair and body hair, if it is from 
						two different locations, it is real hard to interpret and give accurate 
						interpretation of results.</P>
					<P>The subject name appears on the SAC ends the testing, because it has to be 
						anonymous.</P>
					<P>Hair is too misaligned to test. This is sometimes if someone takes it from a 
						hair brush, it is too hard to determine time frames and make interpretation.</P>
					<P>If it is Q and S, our laboratory requires approximately 10 milligrams in order 
						to perform the test. Also, if the collector's signature is missing.</P>
					<P>The TRF is then completed by the tech and then initialled as to whether or not 
						the integrity of the seal is in place or not.</P>
					<P>The SAC is transferred under chain of custody to a weigher. What the weigher 
						does is they take the hair out that was in the aluminum.</P>
					<P>They measure the distance from the head. We test usually about 3.9 centimeters. 
						We cut it and then we take an aliquot of that and we actually then begin 
						testing it.</P>
					<P>We put each of the samples into LAN-labeled tubes, and that is how we control 
						the movement of the sample through the testing.</P>
					<P>The aliquots are placed in batches. The tubes are transferred to the screening 
						laboratory and then we perform an immunoassay for five drug of abuse classes.</P>
					<P>About midnight of the day that we receive the samples we have reported all the 
						samples that have come into the laboratory.</P>
					<P>We have gone back and have begun re-weighing the samples for the second test for 
						the presumptive positives.</P>
					<P>The negative data is reviewed by technologists before they are released to the 
						client.</P>
					<P>Re-weighed samples, which are weighed in the manner which I just stated before, 
						are then sent to the screening laboratory and rescreened by immunoassay.One 
						thing that I haven't mentioned is about the washing, which Dr. Baumgartner has 
						put out on how to eliminate external contamination.</P>
					<P>At the same time that the sample is going through and the washes are being 
						performed, the washes are also put on a separate chain of custody that mirrors 
						the sample, once the sample has been digested and goes into testing.</P>
					<P>If the sample is positive, it then goes over to mass spectrometry after the 
						second screen, where a GC/MS or GC/MS/MS is performed.</P>
					<P>For negatives, for your information, we keep our negatives for approximately 18 
						months. This is done under chain of custody. At the end of 18 months, the 
						samples are destroyed.</P>
					<P>Positives are kept for five years, or at least five years. Sometimes we go a 
						couple of months over.</P>
					<P>The samples, sometimes we use these samples as some of our blind QCs. All 
						movements into and out of storage are controlled by chain of custody. Thank you 
						very much.</P>
					<P>(Applause.)</P>
					<P>DR. WILLETTE: The last presenter on this panel, and our third Michael, is Dr. 
						Michael Baylor, who received his PhD degree in pharmacology and toxicology from 
						West Virginia University in 1976.</P>
					<P>His career was initiated in the clinical toxicology and post mortem toxicology 
						laboratory in Germany and I believe that was with the U.S. Army at that time.</P>
					<P>He has been involved in the field of forensic toxicology and drug testing for 
						over 20 years.</P>
					<P>As part of his service in the army, he was the director of the army's drug 
						testing laboratory at Fort Meade from 1985 to 1987.</P>
					<P>He retired from the army that year and became the technical director of one of 
						the largest commercial drug testing laboratories at the time, which was located 
						in Research Triangle Park.</P>
					<P>He has been a laboratory inspector for the National Laboratory Certification 
						Program since 1988, since it began.</P>
					<P>Not to totally abandon government service, Michael then became a senior staff 
						fellow at the National Institute on Drug Abuse from 1990 to 1993, and served an 
						additional year as a special expert with the newly founded Substance Abuse and 
						Mental Health Services Administration, which we know affectionately as SAMHSA.</P>
					<P>In that capacity, he served with Donna Bush's staff in helping to further 
						develop and implement the work place drug testing program and laboratory 
						certification program.</P>
					<P>He left NIDA to join the Research Triangle Institute and serves as a senior 
						research forensic toxicologist, directly involved as a senior staff person in 
						the operation of the National Laboratory Certification Program.</P>
					<P>In that role his primary areas of responsibility are the laboratory inspection 
						process and the remedial action requirements. Michael is going to talk to us 
						about the collection and chain of custody issues which are well in place, but 
						still remains one of the most vulnerable areas in the whole process, and that 
						is the collection of the specimen.</P>
					<P>DR. BAYLOR: I also would like to thank the Drug Testing Advisory Board for the 
						opportunity to speak and to make a statement. Human drug testing has been 
						proven to be a reliable tool in deterring illicit drug use in the work place, 
						when it is performed and interpreted using appropriate forensic procedures.</P>
					<P>The validity of urine drug testing results requires that consideration be given 
						to the methods that are used for the collection as well as transportation, 
						analysis and interpretation of results. Certainly the collection process is the 
						initiating step.</P>
					<P>The collection site, by definition, is responsible for collecting the specimen. 
						The collection process places much emphasis on properly identifying the 
						specimen, as well as labeling the specimen and packaging and shipping the 
						specimens to the laboratories.</P>
					<P>With today's technology, bar coding has eliminated much of the transcription and 
						human error that had been formerly associated with the process of identifying 
						and labeling items.</P>
					<P>Tamper evident adhesives have again ensured the integrity of the specimen and 
						the seal of the specimen containers, as well as lids with the proper sealing 
						technology have minimized the ability of aqueous specimens to leak from those.</P>
					<P>The utilization of non-leadable and non-tearable sealed bags or containers, 
						primary devices, have again eliminated the risk of specimen leakage, should it 
						occur.</P>
					<P>Specimen site also was responsible for initiating the proper documentation for 
						the process of the identification and collection of specimens.</P>
					<P>The collection site is, lastly, responsible for establishing adequate security 
						measures for not only the collection process, but as well the collected 
						specimens.</P>
					<P>A designated collection site must fulfill at least five basic requirements. It 
						must, for the case of urine collections, have an enclosure where the privacy 
						for urination is possible.</P>
					<P>It must have access to a toilet for the completion of the urination episode. It 
						must also have moist towelettes or a sink for the proper washing of the hands 
						upon completion of the specimen donation.</P>
					<P>It must have a suitable surface for writing for the completion of the documents 
						necessary to complete the collection process.</P>
					<P>It must have restricted access. Restricted access is so that the collection site 
						is secure during the collection process.
					</P>
					<P>Under ideal conditions, the collection site should be secure at all times. 
						However, ideal is normally not what is achieved. Facilities that are used for 
						other purposes may be secured for the purposes of specimen collection by visual 
						inspection.</P>
					<P>Visual inspection normally would include line of sight, that all areas of entry 
						and exit are within the line of sight of the collection official.</P>
					<P>It should allow for the prevention of undetected entry or exit to the area, and 
						it should have effective restriction of access to the collection materials and 
						supplies used in the process of the specimen collection. It should allow access 
						to authorized personnel only.</P>
					<P>Without the collector assuring the integrity of the specimen and adhering to the 
						collection process by collection SOP, any specimen may not be considered as a 
						valid piece of evidence.</P>
					<P>The collection site procedure establishes that primary link between the urine 
						drug testing results and the specimen donor.</P>
					<P>It is at this point that that specimen and the results to be generated by that 
						specimen are linked to an individual donor.</P>
					<P>Donor identification is one of the initial steps. This is generally, by today's 
						standards, a photo identification in most collection procedures.</P>
					<P>Positive identification by an employer or agency representative is an 
						alternative to the possession of a photo identification.</P>
					<P>There are other identifications that may be allowed by specific work place drug 
						testing plans.</P>
					<P>It should be noted that identification by a co-worker or a co-donor is generally 
						not acceptable, and identification by a single, non-photo ID is generally not 
						acceptable in the collection processes.
					</P>
					<P>One of the key points in the collection process is ensuring the integrity of the 
						specimen. Certainly for any specimen collection, clean, unbreakable, leak-proof 
						containers should be utilized.</P>
					<P>The potential for substitution, adulteration or other attempts to sabotage must 
						be limited. In the case of the individual
					</P>
					<P>having to donate the specimen in the privacy of a stall, certainly that is a 
						concern.</P>
					<P>Split specimen collection is generally conceded to, again, add to the integrity 
						of the specimen, allowing the individual to have a sealed bottle A and a sealed 
						bottle B that would be sent on for appropriate analysis.</P>
					<P>There are certainly processes that can significantly minimize adulteration or 
						substitution or other attempts to sabotage a specimen.</P>
					<P>Certainly the measurement and recording of the temperature of the specimen can 
						be utilized a lot. This is generally performed within minutes of the 
						collection.</P>
					<P>You can control access to hot water as far as substitution or dilution attempt. 
						There can be the use of bluing agent in the toilet bowls which are used for the 
						collection process.</P>
					<P>One can monitor dilution by testing specimens for creatinine and specific 
						gravity, as detailed in a number of the work place programs.</P>
					<P>There is certainly a long list of collection supplies which are utilized in the 
						collection process. Certainly appropriate ID to identify the collection, the 
						use of wrapped, sealed collection kits, or specimen bottles with lids, wrapped, 
						sealed specimen containers.</P>
					<P>They include the utilization of temperature strips or temperature measuring 
						device, a custody and control form to document the integrity of the specimen 
						and its identity, the tamper-evident labels and seals for specimen bottles with 
						today's adhesive.</P>
					<P>You can include a separate supply of tamper-evident seals as manual dexterity 
						skills do get challenged with the utilization of plastic gloves in trying to 
						apply adhesive labels.</P>
					<P>Shipping containers are included, and a bluing agent for the toilet bowl.</P>
					<P>One of the most critical aspects of the collection process, or any collection 
						process, is establishing the chain of custody.</P>
					<P>The chain of custody was described by Dr. Cone, and chain of custody is 
						generally perceived to be the procedures and the documentation which attest to 
						the identity, the integrity and the security of the specimen.</P>
					<P>Urine drug testing has utilized what was referred to as a custody and control 
						form which is initiated at the collection site.</P>
					<P>This is a seven-part form. Copy one through three are white copy originals. Copy 
						one original -- all three of those copies generally accompany the specimen to 
						the laboratory.</P>
					<P>One is the original. It accompanies the specimen to the laboratory. It 
						eventually becomes the laboratory archive file copy of the specimen results and 
						it is maintained by the laboratory for a period of two years.</P>
					<P>Copy two, or the second original, is that accompanying the specimen to the 
						laboratory. It is generally utilized by the laboratory to report results to the 
						medical review officer.</P>
					<P>Copy three is a split specimen copy. It accompanies the A and B bottles in a 
						split collection to the laboratory.</P>
					<P>It would generally be used to further test and further transport a specimen to a 
						B lab for B bottle analysis.</P>
					<P>Copy four is a medical review officer copy that goes from the collection site to 
						the medical review officer, and it is pink.</P>
					<P>Copy five is a donor copy. It is green. It goes with the donor upon completing 
						the collection process and leaving the collection site.</P>
					<P>Copy six is a collection site archive copy, and copy seven is the employer copy 
						sent from the collection site to the employer. Collection steps generally 
						involve the identification of the donor, and the donor verifying or completing 
						the information in step one of the custody and control form, which indicates 
						the employer as well as the medical review officer to which results will be 
						reported.</P>
					<P>The donor is generally asked to remove unnecessary clothing and secure personal 
						belongings. These are generally bulky outer clothing or briefcases, et cetera.</P>
					<P>The donor is instructed to wash his or her hands prior to collection so there is 
						no adulteration contamination possible.</P>
					<P>The donor receives the collection container. The donor takes the container into 
						the rest room. Upon completion of donating the specimen, the donor gives the 
						specimen to the collector.</P>
					<P>The collector checks the volume and the temperature and pours the specimen into 
						the transport specimen bottles.</P>
					<P>The collector would then secure the bottles and apply any label or seal that has 
						been properly filled out. The donor would initial the label on the specimen 
						bottle.</P>
					<P>The donor would read and sign the certification statement on copy four of the 
						custody and control form. Only copies four through seven contain donor 
						identifying information.</P>
					<P>The collector would complete the certification step, which is step five of the 
						custody and control form. The collector would sign line one of the custody and 
						control form block, which is step six of the custody and control form.</P>
					<P>The collector then gives copy five of the CCF to the donor.
					</P>
					<P>The collector completes the chain of custody block.</P>
					<P>It places copies one, two, three of the custody and control form and the 
						specimen bottle or bottles in the plastic bag and seals the bag.</P>
					<P>The collector places the sealed bag usually into a secondary shipping container 
						and seals that container. The collector sends copy four of the CCF to the MRO, 
						copy seven of the CCF to the employer, and files copy six of the custody and 
						control form in their archive records.
					</P>
					<P>In summary, the collection procedures are the key, I believe, to the success of 
						all drug testing programs.</P>
					<P>The collector at the collection site is the one individual with whom the donors 
						will have direct, face-to-face contact.</P>
					<P>It is the initial link that links a specimen to an individual. If the specimen 
						is reported positive, the entire collection process must be able to withstand 
						the closest scrutiny and answer all challenges to its integrity. Thank you.</P>
					<P>(Applause.)</P>
					<P>DR. WILLETTE: I wanted to thank the presenters for being generous with their 
						times. They all stayed under their time limits, which will leave us a little 
						extra time in dealing with questions and answers.</P>
					<P>According to the procedures that were set up for this hearing, at this stage the 
						panelists that are here on the podium and the members of the Drug Testing 
						Advisory Board are the only ones permitted to ask questions.</P>
					<P>As was explained to you earlier, those of you from the public may sign up and 
						make comments and ask questions at the assigned times on Wednesday.</P>
					<P>I think it is appropriate, because we have a few minutes, to identify the board 
						members. Now, you have met Dr. Autry and Dr. Donna Bush and Dr. Yale Caplan, 
						who is a member of the board. Certainly Dr. Cone is eligible to ask questions 
						as well, although he is not currently a board member.</P>
					<P>I think it would be good to introduce the others that are here. In the first row 
						we have Dr. Alan Skip Jones from the University of Mississippi, Dr. Dick Pinder 
						from the State of Connecticut, Dr. Tai Kwong -- maybe you can identify 
						yourselves. If they ask questions, you will know who is asking. Why don't you 
						stand up so they can see who they are.</P>
					<P>We have a PhD doctor, but also Colonel Jacobs from the Army Lab in Fort Sam 
						Houston. Diane Wilkins is here, and Melanie Mallory from Scottsdale, Arizona.</P>
					<P>Is Dr. Holland here? We didn't see him earlier. Dr.
					</P>
					<P>Holland is another board member. He is an MRO with the services. These are the 
						board members who we are assigning this monumental task of refining and 
						expanding the mandatory guidelines and giving us advice on work place testing.</P>
					<P>So, who is going to address the panelists with the first question or going to 
						make the first comment?</P>
					<P>DR. CONE: I just wanted to return to something Mike said about specimen 
						collection, which I fully agree. I want to make a quick comment and then maybe 
						have a couple of the panelists respond.</P>
					<P>I hope you will take my comments as constructive comments. Mike said that 
						without the collector ensuring the integrity of the specimen and adhering to 
						the collection process, the specimen may not be considered a valid piece of 
						evidence.</P>
					<P>I guess I have a question for the sweat people and the hair people. In both the 
						application and removal of the sweat patch, of course there is some risk. You 
						outlined the steps that you would take to avoid picking up environmental 
						contamination.</P>
					<P>It looks like it is critical to make sure that the skin is clean and that you 
						apply the patch over clean skin and that you not touch the patch.</P>
					<P>I do see that you are trying to use forceps, I believe, to apply and to remove 
						the patch.</P>
					<P>I am still a little concerned that the person, if the collector or the 
						applicator were not wearing gloves, that there could be inadvertent touching of 
						the patch.</P>
					<P>I know that sounds trivial, but I truly believe and I have seen evidence that 
						you can transfer millions of nanograms of cocaine from surface to a patch or to 
						anything else that you touch.</P>
					<P>I am concerned that you could do more in possibly eliminating the risk of 
						environmental contamination.</P>
					<P>In the same vein, I guess I am shocked to see the collector collecting hair 
						handling the specimen. That is tantamount, to me, to seeing the collector for a 
						urine device sticking his finger in the cup and checking to see whether it is 
						warm or not. I am concerned, obviously.</P>
					<P>A very simple fix, of course, is to wear gloves. Why don't
					</P>
					<P>you guys use gloves?</P>
					<P>DR. WILLETTE: Thank you, Dr. Cone. Who wants to be first?</P>
					<P>DR. KIPPENBERGER: We wash the hair, so we don't see it. External contamination, 
						that is not how you can contaminate hair.
					</P>
					<P>DR. WILLETTE: Does anyone else have a response?</P>
					<P>MR. FORTNER: In response to your concerns, certainly the potential for external 
						contamination exists, which is why you would go through the procedures of 
						gloves and disposable tweezers.</P>
					<P>I just can't help but think that in your scenario, most collection sites that I 
						have visited don't have a lot of free cocaine floating around, but that 
						potentially could exist.</P>
					<P>I think the precaution in the use of disposable gloves and disposable tweezers 
						in application and removal of the patch are reasonable precautions to address 
						external contamination concerns.</P>
					<P>DR. WILLETTE: Let me just interject here a minute, I neglected, in my 
						responsibility here to identify the ex officio members of the board.</P>
					<P>I see Mr. Warren Bush in the audience here from the Nuclear Regulatory 
						Commission and Ken Edgell from the Department of Transportation and Ron Dison 
						and Aaron Lucas from the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts.</P>
					<P>I think -- is it Captain Jeminic(?) or Colonel Smith from the Department of 
						Defense? This is Captain Jeminic from the U.S. Navy who is the Department of 
						Defense representative.</P>
					<P>Any other questions or comments from the board members or panelists?</P>
					<P>DR. WILKINS: I just have a quick question actually for each of the members of 
						the panel, specifically Dr. Peat, Mr. Fortner, Dr. Kippenberger and Dr. Baylor.</P>
					<P>As we are all aware, under the federal guidelines there are accommodations for 
						collection of split specimens. Certainly with each of these matrices it would 
						be possible to collect more than one specimen, presumably.</P>
					<P>Do you have any information about the agreement between split specimens that 
						might occur? Has anybody looked at that?</P>
					<P>DR. PEAT: For saliva, not that I know of. It is in the QC talk.</P>
					<P>MR. FORTNER: There are no provisions for that in the sweat patch. It is 
						conceivable to develop that procedure.</P>
					<P>DR. WILKINS: So, the collection of the hair at this point in time, do you in 
						some circumstances collect split specimens at this point in time?</P>
					<P>DR. KIPPENBERGER: We have at this point a safety net program. If there is a 
						challenge, we get another sample, another collected sample. We also like to get 
						enough hair to repeat the initial assay.</P>
					<P>As part of the safety net program, we test a newly collected sample along with 
						retesting the sample that we kept up in permanent storage. All of that is in 
						Ann Marie's talk, or some examples.</P>
					<P>DR. WILLETTE: Neil, just to follow up on that, has anybody attempted to apply 
						two patches, one serving as the primary and one as the secondary?</P>
					<P>MR. FORTNER: Certainly in some of the clinical trials individuals wore multiple 
						patches. While there is not currently a program in place that does that, it 
						would be easy to address.</P>
					<P>DR. WALSH: What was the concordance in your clinical studies there, in terms of 
						left arm, right arm patch. Are you getting the same result out of both patches? 
						I think that is what the basic question is.</P>
					<P>MR. FORTNER: Certainly very comparable results, if they are applied to the same 
						portion of the body. Upper arm, there didn't seem to be significant difference 
						right arm versus left arm.</P>
					<P>Now, if you were to apply back versus arm, you might see some differences.</P>
					<P>DR. JONES: Dr. Kippenberger, I would say also, to add to Dr. Cone's comments and 
						concerns -- and I know we are going to hear more about external contamination 
						later -- but multiple use scissors are a concern, too, to me.</P>
					<P>I realize that you are preparing these scissors for cleaning, et cetera, during 
						preparation, but that would just be a comment I have.</P>
					<P>I would have one question to you concerning hair testing, though. We frequently 
						are challenged with identity of specimen, et cetera.</P>
					<P>I know even in urine collection the substitution issue is there. Are you doing 
						anything -- it is trivial, but are you doing anything to allow the donor to see 
						the hair cut in a mirror or anything like that?</P>
					<P>It can always be claimed that a hair specimen has been substituted, if they do 
						not see that specimen removed. Are you doing anything like that in your 
						program?</P>
					<P>DR. KIPPENBERGER: No, sir, we don't, to my knowledge.</P>
					<P>DR. JONES: I was just curious. We see these challenges and we have to be 
						concerned about these challenges. So, the integrity or the identity of the 
						specimen was a concern.</P>
					<P>DR. KIPPENBERGER: Plus, we get to collect a new sample.</P>
					<P>DR. JONES: Mr. Fortner, I did have one question. You made
					</P>
					<P>a comment about the patches, that they can be on for extended periods of time.</P>
					<P>What are the data that you have about the life of the patch?
					</P>
					<P>How long are you leaving it on, your collection of this sweat, et
					</P>
					<P>cetera?</P>
					<P>MR. FORTNER: It depends upon the program itself. We know from the clinical 
						studies and from the controlled studies where drug was administered that it 
						shows detectable on the patch within 24 hours.</P>
					<P>Most of the programs are either on a one to two-week cycle, depending upon what 
						type of program, how often they might want an individual to report.</P>
					<P>Personally I have worn patches up to 30 days. So, it depends upon the duration 
						of the program and how they design it.</P>
					<P>DR. JONES: So, you are saying they will stay on up to 30 days, is the type of 
						thing that you would typically see as an outside window.</P>
					<P>MR. FORTNER: I think in general, I mean, you get some subject to subject 
						variability off of that.</P>
					<P>DR. WILLETTE: Following up on that, Neil, what is the incidence of either 
						adverse reactions or patches coming off as part of the inappropriate 
						application of them, or in the collection process?
					</P>
					<P>MR. FORTNER: Certainly if the application site has not been cleaned, while it is 
						removed you will have a higher incidence of fall off, or failure to comply with 
						adhesion.</P>
					<P>There are some individuals who, although the material is hypoallergenic, may 
						show an allergic reaction. In our experience that number has been very, very 
						small.</P>
					<P>DR. WILLETTE: What about showering and washing in terms of the integrity of it?</P>
					<P>MR. FORTNER: Simply because it is a one-way barrier, individuals can carry out 
						normal functions -- swimming, showering -- without any danger.</P>
					<P>The biggest problem, I think, has to do with either active removal of the patch 
						or the physical abrasion which would cause it to try to peel off.</P>
					<P>DR. CAPLAN: A couple here and there. To Mike Walsh, you mentioned you didn't 
						think it was necessary for tests to be done in the presence of the donor.</P>
					<P>Could you elaborate on that a little bit more, whether you think it is really a 
						good practice or not?</P>
					<P>DR. WALSH: The on site test?</P>
					<P>DR. CAPLAN: The on site test being done in the presence of the donor.</P>
					<P>DR. WALSH: I would recommend that it be done in the presence of the donor. I 
						think if you have gone ahead and sealed and initiated a chain of custody, that 
						the test does not have to be done in the presence of the donor, if the only 
						action on a presumptive positive is to send the sealed specimen and full chain 
						of custody on to a certified lab for the standard confirmation procedure.</P>
					<P>DR. CAPLAN: You are talking about in a situation where you have the sealed 
						specimen and the test specimen on site is separate.</P>
					<P>DR. WALSH: That is correct. That was the caveat.</P>
					<P>DR. CAPLAN: For Dr. Kippenberger, you mentioned, and I was not clear, that you 
						do not test unaligned hair. Did you say that? Is that correct?</P>
					<P>DR. KIPPENBERGER: That is true.</P>
					<P>DR. CAPLAN: What is the probability of a specimen coming in and not being tested 
						because it was unaligned.</P>
					<P>DR. KIPPENBERGER: Very slim.</P>
					<P>DR. CAPLAN: I can visualize a lot of people with short hair that you couldn't 
						align --</P>
					<P>DR. KIPPENBERGER: If it is less than 3.9 centimeters, obviously then it doesn't 
						matter if it is unaligned. I am talking about hair that comes in like Donna's 
						length of hair, and it is taken out of her hair brush, not a nice, clean cut 
						next to the skin.</P>
					<P>DR. CAPLAN: You would recommend testing hair which is otherwise smaller than 
						designated length.</P>
					<P>DR. KIPPENBERGER: It doesn't matter which end is the skin end, because it is 
						within the 3.9 centimeters that we test.</P>
					<P>DR. CAPLAN: So, it really doesn't matter whether it is aligned then.</P>
					<P>DR. KIPPENBERGER: In that case.</P>
					<P>DR. CAPLAN: This is a general question for everybody about training. You all 
						mentioned it to varying degrees and I thought it would be useful to comment.</P>
					<P>As to the level of training you think is needed for each of these types of 
						collection, the necessity for documentation which I think we all agree is 
						there, but to what degree.</P>
					<P>Although we don't have it and we all know it is the weakest link probably in the 
						urine collection process, the need for certification of training processes.</P>
					<P>DR. WILLETTE: Let's do them in reverse order. Let's let Michael start, the other 
						Michael, at the other end.</P>
					<P>DR. BAYLOR: Certainly I think training for the urine drug testing is necessary, 
						and certainly those individuals that function as collection site officials 
						should be trained in the technical as well as the administrative aspects of the 
						collection process, and to adhering to an SOP, a standard procedure that is 
						utilized in each and every instance.</P>
					<P>DR. KIPPENBERGER: We have a lot of training aids. We send out people to train. 
						We have a collection manual that just about anybody in the United States, I 
						think could follow very easily.</P>
					<P>We have a collection video that shows in depth for anyone on how to collect. We 
						have a test that we give all of the people that collect samples, to make sure 
						that they know how to collect them correctly.</P>
					<P>Those tests are faxed in to us or are given to us. We correct it and then, based 
						on the performance on the test, we give the collector a certificate saying that 
						they are a certificate collector.
					</P>
					<P>This data base is kept at the laboratory and, if required, could be shown to 
						anyone that this collector was trained or not.</P>
					<P>MR. FORTNER: I think certainly training is very critical, whether it is urine or 
						hair or sweat. There are procedures that need to be followed, techniques that 
						need to be taught.</P>
					<P>That is something that is easily done through a variety of mechanisms -- 
						personal, on-site training, on-site training coupled with videotape for 
						subsequent retraining, and then very specific standard operating procedures, 
						not just for the application, but for the removal and documentation therefore.</P>
					<P>It is something that is done quite readily, but it is quite critical. I would 
						certainly concur.</P>
					<P>DR. PEAT: I would agree with the general comments. I think the experience in the 
						urine testing arena is not that the specimens are collected incorrectly. The 
						documentation is completed incorrectly.</P>
					<P>I think training in the documentation aspects of it is very, very important, no 
						matter what the specimen collected may be.</P>
					<P>I think actual collection of specimens is not such a big issue as training in 
						documentation.</P>
					<P>DR. WALSH: I think for the on-site testing training becomes an even more 
						critical issue. I think some standards for the certification of on-site testing 
						personnel can easily be established.</P>
					<P>I think 10 years ago this was a whole area that we sort of avoided dealing with 
						because we were building a system from scratch.</P>
					<P>I think at this point in time with the DOT model in place, with the various 
						organizations now certifying MROs, I certainly don't think there needs to be 
						two and three day courses to do this.</P>
					<P>A minimum amount of training specifically in the documentation procedures and 
						the use of the device, good knowledge of the particular device to be used on 
						site would be critical.</P>
					<P>DR. CAPLAN: Since the last part was avoided by three out of five people, one 
						quick liner. Do you think there should be a certification process for people 
						doing any feature of the collection that you are representing?</P>
					<P>DR. PEAT: The answer to that is yes, that would be ideal if you could do that. 
						The problem is that the turnover of collectors at clinics, et cetera, is 
						extremely high.</P>
					<P>Certifying collectors is not such an easy process as certifying medical review 
						officers or lab directors or some other people where there is not such a high 
						turnover.</P>
					<P>DR. CAPLAN: I agree that it is difficult. I was just trying to get a sense of 
						whether it would be a useful thing to look at, or whether it is impossible.</P>
					<P>MR. FORTNER: I think it is a useful thing. I think that certainly some of that 
						can be done as part of the training process, where they are certified and 
						provided with a certificate.</P>
					<P>Whether it has to be a national program I think is maybe a question.</P>
					<P>The challenges that come in, independent of what the biological fluid, are 
						always going to have some component at the collection site, and was the person 
						trained and how did you document that particular training.</P>
					<P>DR. WILLETTE: We will give Dr. Bush the privilege of the last question.</P>
					<P>DR. BUSH: Thank you very much. This one will be directed specifically to Mike 
						Walsh concerning on-site drug testing.</P>
					<P>I noticed in the discourse how you spoke about how an individual, a donor of the 
						specimen, could be tested right there.</P>
					<P>You know, the collector collects the specimen, the result comes back, and the 
						individual right there, then, sees the result.</P>
					<P>This is extremely effective in treatment arenas, as we all know. I am going to 
						relay to you grave concerns expressed to me quite recently by collection site 
						individuals, who have described their experiences with collecting alcohol 
						specimens, saliva specimens, by onsite techniques, and then the individual sees 
						that result right there and they have to go on to a confirmation site.</P>
					<P>As I understand it, Bubba isn't always well receiving this information. As I 
						understand it, the presence of drugs in the urine may be occurring at a greater 
						frequency than alcohol in the saliva.</P>
					<P>So, I have had collection site people express grave concern to me, especially on 
						drugs like amphetamines and opiates where there may be cross reactivity to 
						other substances, other than just the focus substances for which the device was 
						made.</P>
					<P>I don't know. How would you suggest collection sites, on-site testing sites, 
						dealing with an immediate cocaine positive or amphetamine positive, showing 
						this to Bubba and saying, Bubba, what do you think of this, we have to move on 
						and this and that. Help me out with this, Dr. Walsh.</P>
					<P>DR. WALSH: I should mention that I hired Donna and she has never forgiven me for 
						that.</P>
					<P>DR. WILLETTE: This is pay back time.</P>
					<P>DR. WALSH: I think it really depends on the reason for the test. If it is a 
						post-incident test or if it is a random test where someone is in a safety 
						sensitive decision versus a pre-employment test is going to make a big 
						difference.</P>
					<P>I think most employers tend not to run the test in view of the employee, 
						although I am finding more and more that especially in larger especially 
						manufacturing companies where the test is being done by the staff nurse in the 
						company medical facility, they will do it in front of the employee.</P>
					<P>The way in which they typically handle it is, I am going to need to send this on 
						to the lab for additional testing, and not that you are positive for cocaine or 
						whatever.</P>
					<P>They have been well trained as to the fact that an on-site result is a 
						presumptive positive and it should be sent on for further evaluation.</P>
					<P>I think particularly in personnel departments where the on-site technology is 
						being used, the applicant specimen is sealed, chain of custody initiated.</P>
					<P>Then the test is run either on an aliquot or in self-contained devices. The test 
						can be run and the results are read after the individual has been asked to step 
						out into the other room.</P>
					<P>The same story is told to the individual. Thank you, we will call you in a day 
						or so and let you know the results of the test. The negatives can be sent on 
						with a negative result.</P>
					<P>DR. BUSH: What would concern me there then -- that is exactly where I want to 
						go. If the test is negative, you tell Bubba, hey, this is negative, so Bubba is 
						not all that out of it.</P>
					<P>Bubba knows these technology. So, Bubba one comes in, Bubba two, Bubba three, 
						and they are all being told oh, negative, negative, negative. Bubba four, well, 
						we will just have to send this on to the lab for some more work.</P>
					<P>DR. WALSH: Right, and a lot of companies like the idea of having a third party 
						deal with it and not getting the results back for 48 to 72 hours. Then the 
						results go back through the system and personnel and somebody else deals with 
						it.</P>
					<P>I think this is the whole issue that DOT is now dealing with, of having to 
						confront the individual immediately and deal with it, get them to an 
						evidentiary breath testing device within 20 minutes.</P>
					<P>There will be procedures that will evolve on how to deal with people who are 
						belligerent.</P>
					<P>I think, again, the individual who is actually conducting the on-site testing is 
						going to have to develop those kinds of skills. I don't have a magic answer for 
						you.</P>
					<P>DR. WILLETTE: Thank you. We have accomplished our mission for this first panel. 
						We have addressed many of the topics and issues of concern dealing with 
						collection and chain of custody.</P>
					<P>We have also stopped at the appointed hour of noon. You have one hour and 15 
						minutes for lunch and the program will start again promptly at 1:15. Thank you 
						very much.</P>
					<P>(Applause.)</P>
					<P>(Whereuponn, at 12:01 p.m., a recess was taken until 1:15 p.m., the same day.)</P>
					<P>A F T E R N O O N S E S S I O N (1:17 p.m.)</P>
					<P>DR. BUSH: We will reconvene the open meeting of the Drug
					</P>
					<P>Testing Advisory Board.</P>
					<P>We will now convene this session entitled Initial Test
					</P>
					<P>Reagents and Procedures Panel. The moderator is Dr. Marilyn Huestis. I have a 
						few words I would like to say about Marilyn.</P>
					<P>Marilyn A. Huestis received a bachelor's degree in biochemistry from Mount 
						Holyoke, a masters degree in clinical chemistry from the University of New 
						Mexico, and a doctoral degree in toxicology from the University of Maryland at 
						Baltimore.</P>
					<P>Dr. Huestis has been working in the fields of forensics and analytical 
						toxicology and clinical chemistry for more than 20 years.</P>
					<P>She was chief toxicologist of Nichol's Institute, San Diego Laboratory, and 
						directed the emergency toxicology, therapeutic drug monitoring, analytical 
						toxicology and urine drug testing operations. She was a child graduate.</P>
					<P>Dr. Huestis was nominated for the research staff fellow award of the Addiction 
						Research Center, NIDA, where she studied the pharmacokinetics and 
						pharmacodynamics of marijuana use.</P>
					<P>Dr. Huestis has published important papers in the area of marijuana 
						pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, evaluation and validation of 
						immunoassays, and on the use of alternate testing matrices for drug analysis, 
						including hair, saliva and sweat.</P>
					<P>Dr. Huestis was awarded the American Academy of Forensic Scientists Irving 
						Sunshine Award for outstanding research in forensic toxicology in 1992, and was 
						elected to the Phi Kappa Phi honor society for outstanding academic 
						achievement.</P>
					<P>She currently serves as secretary of the Society of Forensic Toxicologists, is 
						1998 program chair for the toxicology section of the American Academy of 
						Forensic Sciences, is an active member and former secretary of the California 
						Association of Toxicologists, serves on the therapeutic drug monitoring and 
						clinical toxicology committee of AACC, and is a member of the International 
						Association of Forensic Toxicology.
					</P>
					<P>Dr. Huestis was co-chair of the joint TF SOFT joint congress held in Tampa, 
						Florida in 1994. Currently Dr. Huestis is a senior research scientist at the 
						Addiction Research Center NIDA, where her research interests include the 
						pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs of abuse in humans, evaluation 
						of the effects of drugs on behavior, including correlations of blood levels of 
						drugs and concurrent changes in performance, evaluation and validation of 
						analytical techniques for detection of drugs of abuse in different biological 
						fluids, and medication development projects, including the use of bupronorphene 
						as a pharmacotherapeutic agent in opioid dependence.</P>
					<P>Dr. Huestis is interested in evaluating diverse routes of administration and 
						determining the effects of different routes on the abuse liability of drugs, 
						effects on performance and on the onset, peak and duration of action and the 
						resultant effects.</P>
					<P>In her spare time she does things like this. So, Dr. Huestis.</P>
					<P>Agenda Item: Initial Test Reagents and Procedures Panel.</P>
					<P>DR. HUESTIS: I don't get mad. I just get even. Enough is enough. Is there no 
						body fluid or tissue that can't be analyzed for drugs.</P>
					<P>Alternative specimens provide unique information about an individual's drug use 
						history, and describe different segments of the drug disposition story.</P>
					<P>Each of the alternative specimens considered today has proven to be a valuable 
						analytical sample for other diagnostic clinical chemistry or toxicology tests.</P>
					<P>For example, we have analysis of chloride in sweat in cystic fibrosis patients, 
						therapeutic drug monitoring of theophylline and antiepileptics in saliva and 
						determination of in utero drug exposure in hair.</P>
					<P>For the next three days we will have the opportunity to evaluate the use of 
						alternative specimens and on-site testing methods as a means of monitoring 
						employee drug use in work place drug testing programs.</P>
					<P>This segment of the program deals with initial test reagents and procedures. The 
						goal of the initial test is to identify specimens that contain drug and/or 
						metabolites of interest at a concentration above a designated cut off.</P>
					<P>The initial test separates negative from presumptively positive specimens and 
						must be based on a different analytical principle than that employed in the 
						confirmation test.</P>
					<P>As with any procedure, a thorough method validation is necessary. Controlled 
						drug administration and pharmacokinetic studies document the presence, 
						magnitude and time course of detection of drug and metabolites in biological 
						tissues and guide selection of relevant pharmacologic and analytic cut off 
						concentrations.</P>
					<P>Important factors to consider include assay sensitivity, specificity, accuracy 
						and precision. Analytes of interest vary in the diverse sample matrices.</P>
					<P>Sensitivity is enhanced when assays target the appropriate drug molecules. Cross 
						reactivity with other drug analytes and metabolites may complicate 
						interpretation and decrease concurrence between initial and confirmation test 
						results.</P>
					<P>Although the dynamic range of the assay may be limited, linearity around the cut 
						off and assay precision greatly contribute to an accurate separation of 
						positive and negative specimens.</P>
					<P>Reference materials should be prepared in the same matrix to adequately assess 
						assay performance.</P>
					<P>Sample preparation prior to initial testing and potential for contamination and 
						adulteration vary considerably between the matrices.</P>
					<P>The design and frequency of quality control analyses varies with differences in 
						cut off, stability, batch size and drift across the batch.</P>
					<P>Other analytical factors include, but are not limited to sample size, 
						through-put, cost, training and education of personnel, and instrumentation 
						requirements.</P>
					<P>We are fortunate to have with us today some very knowledgeable and experienced 
						individuals to help guide us through an analysis of the pharmacologic and 
						analytical validation of each method.
					</P>
					<P>Clearly, alternative specimens provide different windows of detection of drug 
						use. Hopefully the next three days will provide us with the necessary 
						scientific knowledge to adequately judge the windows of opportunity that 
						analyses of these alternate specimens and alternate technologies may offer.</P>
					<P>Our first speaker today is Dr. Anthony Costantino, who is the director of 
						toxicology at American Medical Laboratories in
					</P>
					<P>Chantilly, Virginia.</P>
					<P>Dr. Costantino has a bachelors in pharmacy degree, a masters degree from 
						Duquesne University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He has a PhD in forensic 
						toxicology from the University of Maryland.</P>
					<P>He is an inspector for the National Laboratory Certification Program, a 
						diplomate of the American Board of Forensic Toxicology, a fellow of the 
						American Academy of Forensic Sciences, member of SOFT, TIOFF, AACC and the 
						American Pharmaceutical Association.</P>
					<P>As I said, he is currently the director of toxicology at AML. Dr. Costantino.</P>
					<P>DR. COSTANTINO: Under the federal guidelines for work place drug testing, each 
						urine specimen must first be analyzed by screening with an immunoassay kit that 
						has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration.</P>
					<P>Those kits, as used in the work place drug testing program, test for either a 
						specific drug, as in phencyclidine, or a drug class, as in the cannabinoids, 
						cocaine metabolites, opiates and amphetamines.
					</P>
					<P>One point about the FDA approval process, the FDA approval gives some semblance 
						of equality among the different kits for their specific, intended use.</P>
					<P>So, if they are approved to be used for testing for urine a particular cut off 
						for a particular matrix they would be considered to be somewhat equal for that 
						purpose.</P>
					<P>The different techniques that are currently employed in the laboratory for work 
						place drug testing include enzyme immunoassay, radio immunoassay, florescence 
						polarization, and kinetic interaction of microparticles.</P>
					<P>The initial test is defined as an immunoassay test that is used to eliminate 
						negative urine specimens from further consideration and to identify 
						presumptively positive specimens that require confirmation or further testing.</P>
					<P>A negative specimen is any specimen whose apparent concentration of analyte is 
						less than the pre-established cut off concentration for that drug or drug 
						class. That is, the term negative is not restricted to drug free specimens.</P>
					<P>Immunoassay technology is based on the ability to produce antibodies to drugs. 
						These antibodies may be monoclonal or polyclonal.
					</P>
					<P>The polyclonal antibodies are formed by binding a protein to the drug and 
						injecting it into the animal, and actually having the animal's immune system 
						develop antibodies to the drug.</P>
					<P>Monoclonal antibodies are grown in organic cultures in the laboratories -- not 
						the testing laboratories.</P>
					<P>The antibodies must have a label for detection. These techniques rely upon a 
						competitive binding between the antibody and the label drug.</P>
					<P>In the kits, the label drug is supplied by the manufacturer and it competes with 
						the unlabeled drug which would be present in a positive urine specimen.</P>
					<P>There is label on the drug that determines the detection system that will be 
						used. For enzyme immunoassay, FPIA KIMS and not RIA, would be a 
						spectrophotometer.</P>
					<P>These techniques are also considered to be homogeneous because no separation 
						step is needed to separate the bound from the unbound drug complex.</P>
					<P>RIA is heterogeneous. It uses iodine 125 and requires a gamma counter for 
						detection. Because the radioactivity from bound and unbound drug can't be 
						differentiated, it must be physically separated.
					</P>
					<P>The sensitivity of the initial screening method as it applies to work place drug 
						testing must approximate that of the confirmation method.</P>
					<P>The specificity must be such that the reactivity of the assay to compounds which 
						will not be determined on the confirmation assay are not detected.</P>
					<P>There are chemically similar compounds which, at high enough concentrations, 
						will cause a presumptive positive on the initial screening test, but will not 
						be identified as one of the targeted
					</P>
					<P>analytes on the confirmation test.</P>
					<P>Each FDA approved immunoassay kit will provide a list of compounds which were 
						tested for cross reactivity, and the concentration at which they were tested.</P>
					<P>There are always new compounds coming out into the market for medicinal 
						therapeutic uses, and their cross reactivity to a particular assay will be 
						discovered in the laboratories. That information is made known through the peer 
						reviewed literature.
					</P>
					<P>Substances that interfere with the immunoassay reaction or its detection system 
						are also of concern. Some therapeutic compounds may cause a high background 
						absorbance, which interferes with some assays.</P>
					<P>The addition of adulterants to samples may cause false negative results in a 
						number of ways. Some may destroy a particular drug in the sample, while others 
						may affect the technology itself.</P>
					<P>The initial testing process is not only affected by chemicals added directly to 
						the urine, but it is also affected by the concentration of the urine itself.</P>
					<P>Attempts to produce a dilute specimen include consuming
					</P>
					<P>large quantities of fluid or the ingestion of diuretics.</P>
					<P>The laboratory must be aware of adulterants that affect the immunoassay test.</P>
					<P>Most laboratories have procedures in place to determine the integrity of the 
						specimen. The procedures may be applied during the initial receipt of the 
						sample, prior to testing, or during the initial testing process.</P>
					<P>These include, but are not limited to, visual inspection of the specimen when it 
						is received in the laboratory, looking at unusual colored foreign bodies, 
						detection of an unusual odor, pH or the acid content of the specimen, specific 
						gravity creatinine and osmolality are all measures of the concentration of the 
						specimen, chloride content or unusual spectrophotometric reactions, which of 
						course are determined after the testing is completed.</P>
					<P>A laboratory may conduct multiple initial tests prior to GC/MS confirmation. The 
						secondary initial tests may be used because of improved specificity for a 
						particular analyte, or because it is less susceptible to an interferant 
						affecting the first initial test.</P>
					<P>The second initial test is subject to the same criteria as the first initial 
						test. That is criteria with respect to cut off and quality control.</P>
					<P>Most amino assays have been adapted to automated analyzers which allow for the 
						screening of large numbers of specimens in a short period of time.</P>
					<P>Automation helps to minimize human error, and creates a system which may be 
						easier to control.</P>
					<P>The automated analyzers act as pipetting stations for both the specimens and the 
						reagents.</P>
					<P>The package inserts or the instructions provided by the test kit manufacturers 
						may specify the volume of the sample -- that would be the specimen calibrators 
						and controls -- and the volume of each reagent that must be dispensed by the 
						instrument's pipetting system.</P>
					<P>It is important that the pipetting system is evaluated on a regular basis to 
						ensure that proper volumes are dispensed for each of the components.</P>
					<P>The laboratory processing staff will typically provide the aliquot for the 
						initial screening. That aliquot will be applied directly to the 
						instrumentation.</P>
					<P>The instrument will quantitatively pipette the required amount and it may also 
						allow for the proper mixing of reagents and will monitor any time critical 
						steps.</P>
					<P>The instrumentation also requires a means of measuring the end point of the 
						testing reaction. As I stated before, this would require a spectrophotometric 
						detector for some of the homogeneous assays, or a gamma counter in the case of 
						radio immunoassay.</P>
					<P>The analyzers may be operated in what is called a batch mode or a random access 
						mode. Most laboratories will run the analyzers in the random access mode, which 
						allows for the testing of multiple drugs on one aliquot.</P>
					<P>The batch testing mode would allow for the testing of one analyte per aliquot, 
						so multiple aliquots would be needed, where that same aliquot would be tested 
						repeatedly.</P>
					<P>Many automated analyzers have bar code reading capabilities, and are interfaced 
						with the laboratory's information management system.
					</P>
					<P>The bar code label has information which links the aliquot to the initial 
						specimen. The interfacing eliminates manual result entry.</P>
					<P>The critical operating characteristics of the pipetting and detection systems 
						must be checked routinely.</P>
					<P>All immunoassays must be calibrated at the mandated screening cut off. 
						Calibrations may be single point or multi point. Single point calibration 
						typically requires analysis of
					</P>
					<P>other standards to determine the linearity of the screening assay. Multi point 
						calibrations use a series of standards to determine the concentration response 
						curve for the assay.</P>
					<P>If the assay is drug specific, it will be calibrated against that drug. If it is 
						a drug class test, it will be calibrated against a representative analyte in 
						that drug class.</P>
					<P>For example, EIA, as I mentioned before, phencyclidine is used to calibrate the 
						assay. Delta 9 THC carboxylic assay is used to calibrate the cannabinoids assay 
						in EIA.</P>
					<P>The screening cut off is chosen based on the sensitivity of the assay, as well 
						as its pharmacological relevance.</P>
					<P>Cut offs that are too low will result in an excessive number of GC/MS negatives, 
						and cut offs that are too high will result in too many false negatives.</P>
					<P>These are the cut offs that are currently mandated under the HHS guidelines. As 
						we know, when the program started, the cannabinoids were set at a cut off of 
						100 nanograms per milliliter.</P>
					<P>There is a proposed guideline to increase the opiate cut off from 300 to 2,000.</P>
					<P>The accuracy and precision of the calibration is monitored throughout the 
						screening process by analysis of quality control samples.
					</P>
					<P>A minimum of 10 percent of the batch must be QC samples and must include the 
						following: samples certified to contain no drug; positive controls, four to 
						five, with drug or metabolite; at least one positive control with a drug 
						metabolite at or near the cut off; a
					</P>
					<P>sufficient number of calibrators to ensure and document the linearity of the 
						assay over time near the cut off; and a blind quality control sample.</P>
					<P>The preparation and evaluation of QC samples will be discussed, I believe 
						tomorrow by another speaker.</P>
					<P>As you know, the work place drug testing program was founded on urine testing. 
						We have a lot of precedent with the use of immunoassays for the initial 
						screening test.</P>
					<P>Whether EIA, KIMS, RIA or FPIA has been employed in the program, it has been 
						demonstrated that the initial screening of urine samples by immunoassay is an 
						effective means of identifying the negative donor samples as defined under the 
						federal guidelines for work place drug testing. Thank you.</P>
					<P>(Applause.)</P>
					<P>DR. HUESTIS: Thank you, Dr. Costantino. Our next speaker is Dr. David 
						Armbruster.</P>
					<P>Dr. Armbruster has over 20 years of clinical and forensic drug testing 
						experience. He is certified by the American Board of Clinical Chemistry and 
						certified as a chemist by the American Society of Clinical Pathologists.</P>
					<P>Dr. Armbruster has received a bachelor of science degree in chemistry from the 
						University of Missouri, a masters in biochemistry from Rice University, a 
						masters of administration and health service management from Webster 
						University, and a PhD in clinical chemistry from the Medical College of 
						Virginia.</P>
					<P>Dr. Armbruster is an inspection team leader for the DHHS and NLCP programs, and 
						a member of the American Association of Clinical Chemistry, SOFT and Clinical 
						Lab Management Association.</P>
					<P>Dr. Armbruster recently joined PharmChem Laboratories in 1996, where he is the 
						scientific director for PharmChem's Texas Division.</P>
					<P>He is responsible there for the technical quality and reliability of test 
						results. Dr. Armbruster is going to talk to us this afternoon about initial 
						test procedures in sweat testing.</P>
					<P>DR. ARMBRUSTER: Thank you, Marilyn. I will be talking about the initial test 
						reagents we use for screening sweat patch.</P>
					<P>We are particularly talking about PharmChek, which is the sweat patch that we 
						provide through PharmChem.</P>
					<P>As Neil Fortner has already noted, PharmChek is our product, but we don't mean 
						this to sound like a commercial. It so happens that it is the only sweat 
						collection device that is FDA approved and it is the one that we have the most 
						experience using.</P>
					<P>When we talk about collection of urine testing, basically the only thing we need 
						is a plastic cup. We need something a little more sophisticated to collect 
						sweat.</P>
					<P>Certainly you have seen an illustration from Neil of the sweat patch and it is a 
						step above the plastic cup.</P>
					<P>I would leave you with one caveat. Neil has already shown you all the various 
						devices that could be used to collect sweat, going from the sublime to the 
						ridiculous.</P>
					<P>If you were to use one of those sweat collection devices, the findings might be 
						different from what we note with PharmChek.</P>
					<P>Then again, sweat is sweat, and I would be kind of surprised if you found 
						anything too radically different.</P>
					<P>To give you a little bit of background, we consider sweat testing to be an 
						adjunct to sweat testing; in other words, not a replacement for it, but just a 
						little helper to the urine test.</P>
					<P>It basically provides you with a long term monitoring device versus the snapshot 
						that you have when you collect a random urine specimen.</P>
					<P>We like to think that the sweat and the urine specimens will complement one 
						another. There may be cases where one is negative and one is positive. That 
						doesn't mean that they are contradictory. You have to take them in context.</P>
					<P>We do like to try to follow the standardized SAMHSA guidelines as appropriate 
						for sweat testing. Of course, we do initial screening and we do confirmatory 
						testing, the standard two-tier approach.</P>
					<P>The initial testing is via immunoassay, and I think other speakers have already 
						indicated that the immunoassay is a screening test designed for high volume 
						testing.</P>
					<P>We want to eliminate the negatives and identify the presumptive positives and 
						provide either a positive, yes or no, black or white sort of answer.</P>
					<P>We needed to establish testing cut offs or thresholds. As Tony Costantino just 
						noted, SAMHSA has standard, mandatory cut offs for urine testing.</P>
					<P>We don't have any such thing yet for sweat testing. It is a new frontier. We had 
						to come up with our own cut offs. That was exciting for us because we could set 
						the pace and establish our own limits.</P>
					<P>On the other hand, then we have the onus of choosing wisely what we want for a 
						cut off. We went about it by choosing cut offs derived from an empirical 
						performance based approach, a statistical interpretation of the clinical data.</P>
					<P>I have to thank Dr. Cone for indicating that the clinical studies are probably 
						the best approach for coming up with cut offs.</P>
					<P>Dr. Cone also mentioned the receiver operating characteristic or ROC curves that 
						we happen to use with the sweat patch to derive sensitivity, specificity, 
						predictive value and thus establish the cut offs for the screening assays.</P>
					<P>A little bit more background. The sweat patch did go through the FDA approval 
						process. It was originally submitted for FDA approval based on data from RIA 
						and GC/MS data, which is good.</P>
					<P>There was no FDA approved screening assay for a sweat patch at that time. They 
						just weren't out there. So, FDA approval of a sweat patch required clearing a 
						screening assay concurrently with the sweat patch to be used for drug testing.</P>
					<P>STC -- and Dr. Niedbala is a representative of STC -- agreed to work with the 
						patch manufacturer to modify its assays, which are microtiter well plate assays 
						for sweat patch eluates.</P>
					<P>The FDA approved the co-dependent submission, meaning that one product depends 
						upon the other. So, really, the product here is a combination of the sweat 
						patch and of the STC EIA assay.</P>
					<P>It is a little bit different approach, but that is how the FDA wanted to handle 
						it.</P>
					<P>This comes from the publication noted at the bottom here.
					</P>
					<P>What we are looking at is some data for the cocaine assay.</P>
					<P>When I say cocaine I mean cocaine, the parent drug, not benzoathenine. That is 
						one of the characteristics of the sweat patch. We detect the parent drug.</P>
					<P>That is not to say we can't detect metabolites, but it is primarily the parent 
						drug.</P>
					<P>What you are looking at is replicates, namely 72, at each one of these levels, 
						concentrations of cocaine, tested by the EIA STC assay.</P>
					<P>They are judged as to whether positive or negative by setting the cut off at 
						these various concentrations.</P>
					<P>There are no surprises here. If you were down here at five nanograms per ml, it 
						is kind of hard to get a positive, because you have such a small concentration 
						of analyte. You don't have much analytical signal.</P>
					<P>If you go up here around 50 nanograms per ml, there is much more concentrated 
						analyte, much more analytical signal to measure. We can do a better job, 
						precision-wise, accurately, and you get a lot of positives.</P>
					<P>We chose a cut off of 10 nanograms per ml, and you have about a 50/50 chance of 
						getting a positive screen at 10 nanograms per ml. So, we are sort of pushing 
						the envelope. But that is okay.</P>
					<P>The other thing I should point out is the slope of the lines here are intended 
						to represent the analytical sensitivity of the assay.
					</P>
					<P>In other words, the change in analytical signal per change in analyte 
						concentration. You will notice the slope is greatest in the area of the 10 
						nanogram per ml cut off, which is where you would want maximum analytical 
						sensitivity, to get a good separation between negatives and positives.</P>
					<P>The real reason we chose 10 nanograms per ml for the cocaine sweat patch assay 
						for initial testing is on the next slide.</P>
					<P>This is the ROC plot for the EIA assay with cocaine in sweat. I want to point 
						out how to interpret this.</P>
					<P>Here on the Y axis we have sensitivity. This is not analytical sensitivity. This 
						is the clinical sensitivity that Dr. Cone alluded to. It is the number of true 
						positives divided by true positives over false negatives.</P>
					<P>Down here on the X axis we have one minus specificity. This is clinical 
						specificity defined as the number of true negatives over the number of true 
						negatives plus false positives.</P>
					<P>The name of the game is to be up here in the upper left hand quadrant. We would 
						like an assay that is 100 percent sensitive, that detects all the true 
						positives and no false negatives and is also 100 percent specific. It detects 
						all the true negatives and no false positives.</P>
					<P>Guess what. In reality you don't find these kinds of assays, whether it be in 
						forensic toxicology or the clinical laboratory.
					</P>
					<P>It is a very hard beast to come by.</P>
					<P>So, what we try to do is optimize sensitivity and optimitize specificity. Again, 
						this is not that hard to interpret.</P>
					<P>If we chose, say, 50 nanograms per ml as the cut off for the assay, we would 
						have so-so sensitivity. The good news is that our specificity would be 100 
						percent.</P>
					<P>Well, this makes sense. If you have got 50 nanograms per ml of cocaine, by 
						golly, you are going to be a true positive if you test positive at that cut 
						off. By golly, it is going to be kind of hard for you, if you are negative, to 
						get up to a 50 nanogram per ml reading.
					</P>
					<P>This sensitivity, about 72 percent, is not really what we consider ideal. So, we 
						start decreasing the cut off, backing off and going to lower concentrations for 
						a screen cut off.</P>
					<P>As you can see, as we do that sensitivity climbs. However, as sensitivity 
						climbs, specificity starts to drop. We lose something. We are faced with the 
						real world situation. We have to make
					</P>
					<P>a compromise. We have to try to optimize the number of true positives we detect, 
						and the number of true negatives we detect.</P>
					<P>However, in the process of doing that, we have to give on both ends. So, we are 
						going to detect more and more of the true positives, but we are going to lose 
						some true positives. They will be false negatives.</P>
					<P>Likewise, we are going to drop off on our specificity and we are going to have 
						some false positives. Now, we don't like false
					</P>
					<P>positives in forensic drug testing, but we are going to have to accept a few of 
						them in order to optimize both sensitivity and specificity.</P>
					<P>That is what we did here. That is why 10 nanograms per ml was chosen as the 
						initial screening assay cut off.</P>
					<P>Again, if I could borrow a term from Dr. Cone that I really liked, he mentioned 
						pharmacologically relevant cut off. I like to think that this is a 
						pharmacologically relevant cut off.</P>
					<P>Now, where do we get the data? Well, that is down here, 501 specimens from 240 
						subjects. Some of these individuals are drug free, so their sweat contained no 
						drug. Others were known users and others were controlled administration 
						subjects; the clinical data that, again, Dr. Cone mentioned before in his talk.</P>
					<P>So, sensitivity comes out, at 10 nanograms per ml, to be 94.5 percent. 
						Specificity, 99.1 percent. So, again, we give the benefit of the doubt to the 
						individual that is being tested.</P>
					<P>We are willing to give up some sensitivity in order to try to eliminate or 
						certainly minimize the number of false positives that we may detect.</P>
					<P>Going to the next slide, another publication, this one about amphetamines, we 
						have seen this before for cocaine. Much the same thing.</P>
					<P>It just so happens that at about 10 nanograms per ml, we have about a 50/50 
						probability of screening a specimen positive.</P>
					<P>Again, if you visualize the slope of the slide as being the analytical 
						sensitivity, it is maximized up there at about 10 nanograms per ml, which is 
						again where we would want it.</P>
					<P>Here is the ROC curve. Again, you choose a high cut off and you are in trouble 
						because your sensitivity is low. But your specificity is good. But you really 
						want higher sensitivity.</P>
					<P>So, you start backing off. Your sensitivity increases, but you are giving up 
						specificity again.</P>
					<P>If you were to choose five, well, gee, you would have nearly 100 percent 
						sensitivity, which is good, but look, you are somewhere at maybe 80 percent 
						specificity, maybe 20 percent false positives. That is bad.</P>
					<P>Again, we just so happened to choose 10 nanograms per ml, because that seemed to 
						do the optimal job for specificity and sensitivity.</P>
					<P>The data, again, 229 specimens from 50 subjects, again drug free, users, 
						controlled administration studies.</P>
					<P>The sensitivity is not as good as for cocaine, 85 percent roughly. Specificity, 
						93 percent, not bad. Again, it is a give and take, a compromise situation.</P>
					<P>I think what is exciting, though, we didn't pull these values for cut offs out 
						of thin air. These are not arbitrary. They are empirical. They are based upon 
						real clinical data.</P>
					<P>A different set of data might suggest a better cut off, but I think we have a 
						reasonable number of data points here.</P>
					<P>This is just a diagram of a standard STC microtiter well plate assay. I am not 
						going to spend a lot of time on it.</P>
					<P>It is very similar, although the antibodies attach to the wall of the 
						microtiter, to the standard immunoassays we use for urine testing.</P>
					<P>So, we add the specimen calibrator control, an enzyme conjugate, incubate. We 
						have competitive protein binding.</P>
					<P>As Dr. Costantino indicated, it is the basis of all typical immunoassays in 
						urine testing. We wash away the unbound material. We add a substrate, incubate 
						in the dark for 30 minutes, add a stopping reagent and we measure the color.</P>
					<P>It happens to be an inverse relationship in this case, less absorbance, more 
						drug in the specimen. Interpretation, if the absorbance is less than or equal 
						to the cut off, it is positive. If it happens to be greater than the cut off, 
						it is a negative because it is an inverse relationship with the color 
						development.</P>
					<P>We have talked about methamphetamine. We have told you already that the cut off 
						is 10 nanograms per ml. If you are interested, horseradish peroxidase happens 
						to be the enzyme that is part of the conjugate. We use benzidine in the assay 
						as the substrate.</P>
					<P>We talked about the cocaine assay already, cut off, again, 10 nanograms per ml. 
						Here is the opiate assay. We also chose 10 nanograms per ml as the cut off, on 
						the basis of 215 specimens, 95 subjects. Sensitivity 86.9, somewhat similar to 
						the amphetamines, specificity 92.8, also similar to the amphetamine assay. They 
						are reasonable figures.</P>
					<P>Here is the PCP assay. We chose 7.5. Surprise, it is not 10 nanograms per ml. 
						Why did we choose 7.5? Because the data on the ROC plot suggest that 7.5 was 
						the optimal value to choose for sensitivity and specificity.</P>
					<P>The 235 specimens, 94 subjects, sensitivity is not as good as with the other 
						assay, 70 percent. The specificity is very good, though, 98.9 percent.</P>
					<P>Once again, as with urine testing, we try to give the benefit of the doubt to 
						the individual being tested, try to minimize the number of false positives that 
						the assay may generate.</P>
					<P>With all these assays we have calibrators and controls, at zero, at half cut 
						off, at the cut off, and at five times the cut off which, again, mimics pretty 
						much what we see in many urine immunoassays.
					</P>
					<P>THC I didn't mention before. THC is a switch up here. Now we are using -- I want 
						to give DPC credit. Diagnostics Product Corporation, we used their RIA for the 
						sweat patch for THC.</P>
					<P>Why don't we use the microtiter well plate from STC? It is a matter of the 
						antibody. The antibody in the DPC assay tends to have better binding with THC.</P>
					<P>Once again, it is the THC, not the carboxylic acid metabolite, that we are 
						measuring here. It is the parent active drug that comes out in the sweat.</P>
					<P>So, we needed an assay with an antibody that would react preferentially with 
						THC, the parent compound.</P>
					<P>We found in the DPC RIA, it is a typical double antibody RIA which I am not 
						going to spend a great deal of time going through the mechanism of it.</P>
					<P>The cut off here is five nanograms per ml, not 10 and not 7.5. Again, why is it 
						at five? Because the clinical data of 242 specimens, 71 subjects, indicated 
						that that was the optimum cut off, a pharmacologically relevant cut off.</P>
					<P>Sensitivity, 68 percent, specificity 89 percent, maybe not the best, but a 
						reasonable compromise, and we can go well below that. Final slide, this is how 
						we view what we are doing with the
					</P>
					<P>sweat patch. Down at the bottom we have standard urine testing. Urine is the 
						traditional specimen.</P>
					<P>We are dealing with an alternative specimen, namely, sweat. Micturition, the way 
						of traditionally collecting a specimen for urine testing, we need something 
						different. We need the sweat patch. It is a more involved device. It is new 
						technology.
					</P>
					<P>Nevertheless, we have immunoassay and GC/MS, the established methodologies, for 
						both.</P>
					<P>Here, of course, for urine testing the SAMHSA regulatory guidelines which are 
						mandatory for urine testing, we apply them as best we can for the sweat patch.</P>
					<P>The idea is to come up with reliable, scientifically valid, forensically 
						defensible drug testing with an alternative specimen source. Thanks a lot.</P>
					<P>(Applause.)</P>
					<P>DR. HUESTIS: Thank you, Dr. Armbruster. Our next speaker is Dr. James Towt. He 
						has a doctorate in pharmacology from the University of Medicine and Dentistry 
						of New Jersey in Rutgers University.</P>
					<P>He has been with Hoffman-LaRoche for more than 13 years as a research scientist. 
						He is currently the research leader for decentralized testing systems at Roche 
						Diagnostic Systems.</P>
					<P>He is going to talk to us today about on-site testing. Dr. Towt.</P>
					<P>DR. TOWT: The one good thing about not having a long and distinguished career is 
						that the introductions are mercifully short.
					</P>
					<P>Before I get started with the reagents and procedures for on-site testing, I 
						just would like to address Donna's comment about Bubba.</P>
					<P>That is that the testing does not have to be confrontational. You can set up 
						systems where random negatives are sent out, unbeknownst to the people being 
						tested so that the presumptive positives, the people don't know if they are 
						presumptively positive.
					</P>
					<P>Alternatively, if you choose to be confrontational, it has been shown in other 
						testing situations, that these people do want to appear to be smart, typically, 
						and when faced with a positive result, readily admit to using the substances 
						that are being tested for.</P>
					<P>The on-site drugs of abuse tests are competitive immunoassays for screening 
						urine samples. The reagents used in these on-site immunoassays consist of the 
						antibodies, drug derivatives and various buffers and stabilizers.</P>
					<P>These constituents are similar, or the same as the instrument based assays now 
						being used in the HHS approved drug testing laboratories.</P>
					<P>These on-site assay systems are approved by the Food and Drug Administration, as 
						are the assays that are used in the laboratories.</P>
					<P>The on-site assays are manufactured under good manufacturing practices 
						established by the FDA. Some of the developers and manufacturers of these 
						on-site assays are, indeed, the same manufacturers making the laboratory-based 
						assay systems.</P>
					<P>In preparing this talk I didn't realize that virtually the entire forensic 
						toxicology community would be here, so please bear with my simplistic overview.</P>
					<P>As in the laboratory based assay, drug in the sample being tested competes with 
						drug derivative in the on-site assay system for binding to anti-drug antibody 
						in the assay system.</P>
					<P>As in the laboratory based reagent systems, you label one of the components of 
						the assay. In the on-site assay systems, either the drug derivative can have a 
						label, or the anti-drug antibody having the label.</P>
					<P>In the laboratory based reagents, the label consists of either an enzyme, a 
						microparticle, a fluorescent molecule or a radioactive isotope.</P>
					<P>In the laboratory based reagents, these labels are read by an instrument and not 
						by the human eye.</P>
					<P>In the on-site assay systems, the label typically consists of an enzyme or a 
						microparticle, and instead of being read by an instrument, it is read visually.</P>
					<P>In the on-site assay systems, the reagents are set such that a visual difference 
						is created - this is usually color formation -- between those samples 
						containing drug at or above a minimum concentration -- and those are the SAMHSA 
						established cut off concentrations -- and those samples containing no drug or 
						drug below the minimum concentrations.</P>
					<P>Like the laboratory based screening assays, these results are interpreted 
						qualitatively as negative for drug or presumptively positive for drug.</P>
					<P>In some of the on-site devices, the drug derivative is labeled, such as here. If 
						the sample does not contain drug analyte, the antibody binds up the label 
						derivative, leaving no label to be detected, indicating a negative result.</P>
					<P>On the other hand, if the sample does contain drug, the drug preferentially 
						binds the anti-drug antibody, leaving the labeled drug derivative free to be 
						detected, indicating a positive result, or a presumptively positive sample.</P>
					<P>In the alternate format, where the anti-drug antibody is labeled, the drug 
						derivative is typically immobilized on some support system.</P>
					<P>In this case, when there is no drug in the sample, the anti-drug antibody, which 
						has the label, is bound to the immobilized drug derivative, producing a color 
						formation and indicating a negative sample.</P>
					<P>In the case where the sample does contain the drug, again the drug 
						preferentially binds the labeled antibody, preventing it from binding the 
						immobilized drug derivative. In this case, no color is formed and it is 
						indicative of a positive sample.</P>
					<P>Now, talking about the on-site testing procedures, you have heard about the 
						chain of custody and all the documentation that is necessary.</P>
					<P>Compared to the training needed for the documentation and controlling all that 
						paperwork and sample integrity, the actual training and performing and 
						interpreting of on-site testing is very simple.</P>
					<P>The procedure for on-site testing typically involves introducing an aliquot of 
						the collected urine sample into the test device containing the reagents.</P>
					<P>After waiting approximately five to ten minutes, a visual cue appears, which Dr. 
						Cone referred to as an internal control.</P>
					<P>This indicates that the reagents have run and results may be interpreted.</P>
					<P>The urine sample is determined to be negative or presumptively positive for the 
						drug analytes by the presence or absence of a visual label. This visual label 
						shows up in a results window.
					</P>
					<P>Presumptive positives would be sent on to a laboratory for confirmatory testing, 
						where negative specimens could be immediately disposed of.</P>
					<P>Since the reagents of the on-site tests make use of the same immunochemical 
						reactions used by the laboratory based tests, they screen for the same analytes 
						as the laboratory based tests.</P>
					<P>The reagents are set to detect the same level of drug in the urine as the 
						laboratory based tests. These again are the SAMHSA established cut off 
						concentrations shown in the slide.</P>
					<P>Likewise, the units of measure are nanogram per milliliter, which are the same 
						as the currently approved testing methods.</P>
					<P>Part of the FDA approval process for the on-site drug test is the demonstration 
						of the specificity and the sensitivity of the test. Just as in the HHS 
						laboratory-based assays, the specificity
					</P>
					<P>is determined by testing individual urine samples spiked to contain known 
						quantities of related and unrelated drug compounds.
					</P>
					<P>Sensitivity is similarly determined by testing individual urine samples 
						containing known concentrations of the analyte to be tested, and actual 
						clinical specimens.</P>
					<P>Performance of the on-site tests are compared to the laboratory-based tests by 
						testing clinical specimens using both methods. The results of the specificity 
						testing and sensitivity
					</P>
					<P>testing are reported in the manufacturer's package inserts.</P>
					<P>Representative copies of the on-site testing inserts were available, but I 
						understand they were not put into the book.</P>
					<P>In addition, there are a number of toxicologist and noted clinical scientists. I 
						think most are here in the audience, who have evaluated on-site devices and 
						have published the results in peer reviewed journal articles.</P>
					<P>Just as a summary, I would like to say that the on-site tests are based on 
						similar competitive immunochemical reactions as the laboratory based reagents 
						now being used.</P>
					<P>They make use of the same antibody drug derivative interactions. They test for 
						the same drug analytes at the same concentrations and they have similar 
						specificities and sensitivities as the laboratory-based reagents. Thank you.</P>
					<P>(Applause.)</P>
					<P>DR. HUESTIS: Thank you, Dr. Towt. Our next speaker is Dr.
					</P>
					<P>R. Sam Niedbala. He is the executive vice president and founder of STC 
						Technologies in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.</P>
					<P>Dr. Niedbala has a masters in clinical chemistry and a doctorate in clinical 
						chemistry from Lehigh University.</P>
					<P>At STC Dr. Niedbala's responsibilities include management of all diagnostic 
						products and business activities.</P>
					<P>STC develops, manufacturers and markets proprietary immunodiagnostic products, 
						capable of detecting substances in various body fluids, for use in commercial 
						labs, physician offices, hospitals and on-site testing.</P>
					<P>Dr. Niedbala has a number of patents and has authored over 31 publications on 
						various topics. Dr. Niedbala, please.</P>
					<P>DR. NIEDBALA: Thanks, Marilyn. Let me just start with a little bit of an 
						introduction. Marilyn had given you a background on STC.</P>
					<P>I think it is important to note that part of our mission has been to target the 
						development of technologies for use in detecting drugs of abuse in alternate 
						fluids.</P>
					<P>Mike Peat had earlier talked about codeine and cocaine in saliva, and Dr. 
						Armbruster has already talked about some of our work in contribution to the 
						sweat patch.</P>
					<P>As a company we have watched saliva testing -- and that is in particular what I 
						am focusing on now -- change over the last few years.</P>
					<P>In the early 1990s, there was a meeting down in Florida specifically to address 
						the use of saliva as a diagnostic fluid. There were some very simple 
						conclusions that had come out of that.
					</P>
					<P>Since that time there has been a tremendous amount of work using this fluid, not 
						necessarily with drugs of abuse.</P>
					<P>As I was thinking about the meeting and preparing, I felt like the junior member 
						of the alternative fluids we were looking at, in terms of the amount of data 
						and publication, although it has been talked about for years.</P>
					<P>There have been an awful lot of publications with some of the other fluids being 
						discussed. Then I stepped back one more step removed, and I thought about all 
						the work and publications out now using saliva or oral fluids for things like 
						HIV.</P>
					<P>Over the counter, we are looking at people like Smith-Kline, who have bought 
						significant equity stakes in companies like Epitope, with a future goal -- and 
						we can all just wait and see when this happens -- of bringing saliva testing 
						out to the general population as well as the lab population.</P>
					<P>I think the opportunity is here for saliva as well as some of the other fluids. 
						To go back to our T shirts back at that meeting in Florida, and taking a quote 
						from that, truly, spit happens.</P>
					<P>I think we have got some significant things to look forward to with this fluid. 
						I am sorry, after lunch I have got to watch half of you dozing off, and I had 
						to throw something in here, to lighten this back up.</P>
					<P>What is saliva? I think we need to start at this point.
					</P>
					<P>There are some significant yet discrete differences, as we look at this fluid.</P>
					<P>Really, whole saliva is a combination of several fluids from three different 
						glands, some major, some minor -- the parotid, the sublingual, and the 
						submandibular.</P>
					<P>As you know, when you get up to make a speech such as this, your mouth goes dry. 
						Obviously what is left is more the mucous materials, versus some of the parotid 
						fluids, which may feel real comfortable at cocktails later on today.</P>
					<P>However, when we think about what we are measuring, I really think it comes down 
						to the bottom here, which is mucosal transudate, which is really the fluid that 
						permeates back into the oral cavity from the blood.</P>
					<P>This is where I believe we need to focus our efforts, as Dr. Peat had said 
						earlier.</P>
					<P>If we look at saliva as a fluid for testing, we see that saliva has several 
						advantages. In this particular case, I am comparing it to urine alone.</P>
					<P>Collection of saliva is easy. It is very simple to walk
					</P>
					<P>into a room with someone and witness that collection.</P>
					<P>The devices, as you will see noted in a few minutes, vary in terms of how they 
						work. It is very easy to imagine sort of a lollipop stick with an absorbent pad 
						on it, put into your mouth, witnessed, taken out, put into a container and 
						mailed back to the laboratory for analysis.</P>
					<P>This is really the stage of testing that saliva is at right now. There have been 
						publications about those working on on-site tests for saliva, and I believe 
						that those will come with time.</P>
					<P>However, as we step through technological development, the simplest, most 
						straightforward way to start is with a lab-based test.
					</P>
					<P>So, as you look at collection, you can envision this being very easy.</P>
					<P>Chain of custody, again I think that falls into an easier category versus some 
						of the things we have to build in for urine testing.</P>
					<P>Safety is very high with saliva. There have been many, many reports looking for, 
						for example, HIV transmission with oral fluids. So, the safety of saliva itself 
						is very good.</P>
					<P>Training, I think, in both cases I had graded as low. It has been said over and 
						over again, if you have a good protocol, if you follow it everything always 
						works.</P>
					<P>It is usually when we push the validation of that into people's hands who may 
						not follow the protocol, how much better is it to work with one fluid versus 
						another is what we would have to consider.
					</P>
					<P>Overhead costs for saliva is relatively low versus urine, but I do have to say 
						this. I forget who it was earlier who talked about the simplicity of a urine 
						cup, which costs maybe a few pennies.</P>
					<P>The people who make saliva devices have not yet quite caught up in competition. 
						So, the cost of these particular devices is still fairly high.</P>
					<P>Their rationale for that is that the overheads is not as high. Therefore, I 
						believe they think they can charge more for these particular types of devices.</P>
					<P>As we look at saliva as a fluid -- I think our meeting on saliva years ago had 
						concluded this fairly consistently -- is that saliva is fairly useful when you 
						want to qualitatively identify the presence or absence of materials such as 
						drugs of abuse, hormones, certain proteins, infectious diseases.</P>
					<P>The fluid has been looked at for things like therapeutic drug monitoring, but 
						there are variations. In some cases we suspect that, because of the PKA of 
						drugs, we need to consider this fluid very carefully as we walk through the 
						analysis and analytical evaluation of any screening methodology.</P>
					<P>If we look at requirements for all the immunoassays in alternative fluids, 
						saliva is a great example for us to start with. First of all, we need to have 
						again the right cross
					</P>
					<P>reactivity of our antibodies with the analytes or metabolites found in that 
						specimen.</P>
					<P>As has been said already, in many cases the parent drug is found in very high 
						concentrations in some of these alternate fluids, saliva being one where this 
						is true.</P>
					<P>GC mass spec absolutely has to be the gold standard for us to follow up with 
						confirmation. Again, our cut offs must be set based on the best sensitivity, 
						specificity and efficiency, and the ROC analysis that was discussed earlier for 
						sweat, I think, clearly is appropriate for this as well.</P>
					<P>Finally, we need to do this within the populations that we are looking at. The 
						predictive value needs to be tied into how we evaluate the testing methodology.</P>
					<P>If we look at some of the initial test reagents and procedures, the possible 
						menu includes the common list of drugs of abuse that we are very familiar with 
						and Mike Peat had mentioned earlier.
					</P>
					<P>Codeine is an additional one that is analyzed very often in saliva. As many of 
						you know, we have been involved as a company with alcohol testing, not immuno 
						based obviously, but very much in practice with saliva.</P>
					<P>Again, our key factors as we look at saliva for these types of analytes, is that 
						we must target the metabolite or parent.</P>
					<P>We must then select the correct antibody or develop it. We need to keep in mind, 
						as we look at the test, what are the differences here.</P>
					<P>I think that theme is coming out more and more as we go through today, and I am 
						sure tomorrow, in that different fluids provide different levels or different 
						qualities of information, which I think can be very, very useful when we look 
						at time since exposure, time since dose, under the influence situations. This 
						is where saliva is very different from some of the other fluids.</P>
					<P>Finally, the sensitivity of the screening method that is being used has to be 
						considered. In many cases, my general experience has been that as we compare to 
						the urine cut offs, these alternative fluids, we must be somewhere between one 
						tenth and one thirtieth the cut off that are currently used with urine.</P>
					<P>So, it is a challenge for us as far as screening technologies are concerned. Our 
						job with that screening technology is to, as I term is, interrogate these 
						specimens accurately and quickly.
					</P>
					<P>What was discussed earlier with the sweat patch is that in presenting to the FDA 
						for clearance of these products -- I am trying not to use the term approved, 
						but rather for the clearance of the products - what was determined through our 
						experience there is that there must be a marriage between a collection device 
						and a screening device such that they become a system.</P>
					<P>There are different collection devices for saliva that I have seen over the last 
						several years. They really do run the gamut.</P>
					<P>If you go back into the literature you will see things like dental cotton simply 
						packed in the mouth and then extracted.</P>
					<P>In recent years we can look at devices such as the Epitope device such as Dr. 
						Peat had shown earlier. Saliva Diagnostics is another one that you generally do 
						not find within the United States, but does have an FDA clearance for sale as a 
						saliva collection device alone.
					</P>
					<P>There is no marriage with a screening test. So, its utility is really limited.</P>
					<P>Then most recently there is a new company, a new player called Avatar. Their 
						particular collection device I have not tested or seen.</P>
					<P>In addition to these collection devices onto pads, there is the idea of 
						collecting whole saliva, which is essentially collected into a tube, stored, 
						and then must be diluted or processed somehow, from Sarstadt, called the 
						Salivette. Some of you may be familiar with it.
					</P>
					<P>This is an overview of the different collection devices that are available. None 
						of them at this point in time have any clearances from the FDA for use with 
						drugs of abuse testing, but I can tell you that this will be coming.</P>
					<P>If we look at now, after collection, the procedures for testing, we have talked 
						earlier about different types of competitive EIA.</P>
					<P>Again, based on the selection of antibodies, I put possibly RIA or EIA. Of 
						course, we could go back to more manual methods of gas chromatography, mass 
						spectroscopy, HPLC or GC.</P>
					<P>If I give you one example from one of the microtiter plate assays which we are 
						using for sweat as well as saliva testing, you will see that if we compare 
						cross reactivities, what we have done here is develop antibodies that will 
						pretty much evenly cross react between benzoylecgonine and cocaine. In 
						addition, it has some very good cross reactivity with cocaethylene.</P>
					<P>Methodologically, this is a very simple test, in that sample and reagent are 
						mixed and incubated for 30 minutes. There is a wash step, addition of substrate 
						30 minutes later, and absorbance is measured.</P>
					<P>In the years that we have been doing this, we have developed instrumentation and 
						software which can screen very high volumes using this method.</P>
					<P>So, in summary, the last point I wanted to make is that, for saliva we are at 
						kind of a cross roads with this particular fluid.</P>
					<P>We need to marry the collection with the testing. If we look at saliva as a 
						fluid, we know that unstimulated, we can collect about .32 mls per minute. Then 
						daily we are somewhere between 1.5 liters would be available. When I said spit 
						happens, it is available.
					</P>
					<P>So, if we look at the steps -- and this would be using the OraSure device from 
						Epitope now called Episcreen -- step one would be to collector in the mouth.</P>
					<P>Number two would be to collect a saturated lollipop in this particular case, 
						place it into a preservative fluid, seal it, send it to the lab. That fluid is 
						then removed and analyzed.</P>
					<P>It is very easy in terms of processing and, again, I think generationally this 
						is where we are with saliva testing to date. Thank you.</P>
					<P>(Applause.)</P>
					<P>DR. HUESTIS: Thank you, Dr. Niedbala. Our last speaker today is Dr. Verner A. 
						Baumgartner. Dr. Baumgartner received his PhD in physical chemistry from the 
						University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.</P>
					<P>He has been associated with the Department of Veterans Affairs since 1967, where 
						he has held a variety of research positions.</P>
					<P>He is the founder of Psychemedics Corporation and is current scientific 
						director.</P>
					<P>Dr. Baumgartner's main research interest over the past 20 years has been the 
						analysis of hair for licit and illicit drugs. Dr. Baumgartner today is going to 
						talk to us about initial testing with hair as a specimen.</P>
					<P>DR. BAUMGARTNER: Given our time constraints, my main objective in this talk 
						today is to discuss the clinical specificities and the clinical sensitivities 
						of the RIA assays.</P>
					<P>That is, how cut off were defined so that hair analysis is safe against 
						interpretive false positive due to internal passive drug exposure.</P>
					<P>In other words, I am talking about Ed Cone's alligators and tigers mostly.</P>
					<P>As the problem of urinalysis has shown, and the more recent studies by Dr. Cone 
						that the passive ingestion of one milligram of cocaine can cause positive 
						urinalysis results, a real problem for a nondrug using spouse of a drug user, a 
						passive internal drug exposures is certainly one of the main forensic issues of 
						drug testing.</P>
					<P>It is therefore important to establish how hair analysis stands on this critical 
						matter.</P>
					<P>Our safety measures, again, interpreted false positives due to external 
						contamination will be discussed in the talk on data interpretation.</P>
					<P>I want to make it very clear that specificity cannot simply be defined in terms 
						of mass spectrometry but in terms of passive
					</P>
					<P>internal exposure and passive external exposure.</P>
					<P>Conversely, we don't want to make the test so safe against internal passive drug 
						exposure that it only identifies heavy drug user.
					</P>
					<P>Consequently, our hair analysis balances clinical specificity against clinical 
						sensitivity that will also be discussed in my talk.</P>
					<P>These two opposing test parameters are defined by the well known relationship 
						shown in the next slide.</P>
					<P>However, before covering these topics, let me briefly put you in the picture of 
						how we do the hair assay.</P>
					<P>We use a three-month detection window, which we access with a one-and-a-half 
						inch of the most recently grown hair cut close to the scalp.</P>
					<P>All our variations are produced by Psychemedics. Hair is extensively washed -- 
						and I will talk about it in great length later in my second talk. The 
						efficiency of washing is evaluated by wash kinetic procedures.</P>
					<P>Drugs are liberated by enzymatic digestion of the hair specimen. A patent has 
						been granted for the performance of the EIA on the hair digests.</P>
					<P>Before digesting, the melanin fraction is removed by centrifugation to avoid the 
						possibility of any hair color or racial bias effects, in case any special 
						binding to melanin should occur.</P>
					<P>Independent blind field studies at the University of Southern Florida with 315 
						African Americans and 846 Caucasian arestees have demonstrated the absence of 
						hair color racial bias effects by our methods.</P>
					<P>That is, self reported urinalysis and hair analysis data all indicated that the 
						African American users had twice as many cocaine users as the Caucasian group.</P>
					<P>Except for marijuana, RIAs are performed with one milligram hair samples. With 
						marijuana we use four milligrams. The detection limits are set in three 
						standard deviations with the matrix effect being the zero values of negative 
						populations.</P>
					<P>Matrix effects are minimized by removing interfering substances by washing and 
						keeping a constant protein concentration in the hair digest.</P>
					<P>Except for marijuana, no major cross reactivity effects occur. Cross reactivity 
						effects which occur for essentially all nonmarijuana users are removed by a 
						patented procedure.</P>
					<P>The RIA assay utilizes an uncharacterized marijuana analyte. Positive RIA 
						screens for marijuana are confirmed by the measurement of carboxy THC by a 
						metabolite which does not occur in marijuana smoke.</P>
					<P>My paper written for this conference describes all the above and the other 
						aspects of my talk in greater detail.</P>
					<P>As it turns out, the three standard deviation detection limit of RIA is at a 
						much lower drug concentration than can be obtained by forensic quality mass 
						spectrometry.</P>
					<P>This is shown in the next slid by an order of almost 10. The question arises, 
						therefore, what is the quantity of drug that, upon ingestion, will produce drug 
						levels in hair which correspond to the cut off levels defined by the limit of 
						quantitation of forensic quality mass spectrometry.</P>
					<P>Obviously this value differs for different individuals due to biochemical 
						individuality effects.</P>
					<P>With respect to this question, hair testing has a tremendous advantage over 
						urine, blood and saliva testing, meaning the setting of cut off levels.</P>
					<P>That is the kinetically non-fluctuating nature of the analytes in a hair 
						specimen.</P>
					<P>The method used for ascertaining the minimum drug dose is based on the well 
						documented fact that within the same individual, there is -- the individual is 
						his own control -- the concentration of drug and hair is directly proportional 
						to the ingested dose.</P>
					<P>This linear relationship is clearly illustrated in this slide. It was obtained 
						with C57Bl6 mice, very black mice. They are identical twins, essentially, and 
						you see this in the melanin.</P>
					<P>Of course, the experimental demonstration of this relationship requires 
						effective wash and extraction procedures.</P>
					<P>It should also be noted that this experimentally verified relationship is 
						expected on theoretical grounds, and it applies also to sweat patch testing, 
						where it has also been experimentally verified.</P>
					<P>The minimum detectable drug dose giving rise to cut off level drug concentration 
						in a particular individual's hair can be calculated from the linear dose 
						relationship, and the individual self report of the amount of drug used, and 
						the measured drug concentration found in the individual's hair for the reported 
						drug dose.</P>
					<P>These calculations are then performed on a population of drug users with self 
						reporting. The average drug dose corresponding to the mass spectrometric cut 
						off level is then calculated for the population using a particular drug.</P>
					<P>What such data looks like is here. On the bottom is what the self report is of 
						use, and on the Y axis is how much was found in hair.</P>
					<P>By way of illustration, how the minimal detectable dose cut off concentration is 
						determined, let me select three individuals, C, D and E, from the previous 
						slide.</P>
					<P>Let us start with the individual C. OC1, the line OC1, represents the 
						experimentally verified linear dose correlation.</P>
					<P>The amount of drugs that individual C would have to have ingested to produce 
						drug levels in hair equalling the cut off value is determined by the 
						perpendicular from the point where line OC intersects with the cut off line, 
						AB; that is, point C3.</P>
					<P>Of course, this diagram is nothing more than a graphic illustration of the very 
						similar proportional calculation on the basis of the linear dose relationship.</P>
					<P>The different minimum drug doses, C3, D3 and E3 are obviously caused by 
						biochemical individuality effects.</P>
					<P>The average value of the minimum drug dose for the different drugs is shown in 
						the next slide. These are for cocaine, 264 cocaine per month of cocaine. For 
						morphine, 1.9 bag per week, for marijuana .5 joints a week and for PCP, .44 
						sherms per week, and for meth 330 milligrams.</P>
					<P>These values clearly indicate that hair analysis results are safe against 
						passive internal exposure to drugs.</P>
					<P>It is important to note that this evaluation is quite independent of whether 
						there is a correlation between drug dose and hair levels existing in the 
						population of drug users.</P>
					<P>These evaluations of the safety of the hair cut off levels was subjected to 
						further independent testing. This was done with the most sensitive assay there 
						is with cocaine where cut off levels are closest to passive drug exposure 
						levels.</P>
					<P>One such blind study performed at the University of Southern Florida involved 50 
						under cover policemen who were extensively exposed to cocaine as part of their 
						drug detection work.</P>
					<P>The negative results of this study clearly shows that passive internal exposure 
						to cocaine is not a problem for hair analysis, and this has been published in 
						the February issue of the Forensics International Journal.</P>
					<P>In another evaluation, we and Dr. Sachs independently performed studies with 
						poppy seeds. Dr. Sachs studied the ingestion of 250 grams of poppy seeds 
						containing 173 milligrams of morphine per kilogram of poppy seed. It produced 
						no interpretive false positive test results in his test subjects.</P>
					<P>All these studies referred to in my talk, of course, have been published.</P>
					<P>Clinical sensitivity. The question arises, how is the exceptional safety of hair 
						testing against passive internal drug exposure related to the clinical 
						sensitivity that is the detection efficiency of the test.</P>
					<P>Although clinical sensitivity can be accurately measured by controlled dose 
						studies, when therapeutic agents are involved part of the controlled dose 
						studies, in contrast to negative controlled dose studies, do not provide an 
						accurate measure of the clinical sensitivity of an assay in toxic illegal 
						substances such as drugs of abuse that are being investigated.</P>
					<P>The reason for this is that the controlled dose studies, if they can be applied 
						at -- for example, in the case of PCP -- can only cover very low -- that is, 
						non-toxic dose ranges -- in short time periods.</P>
					<P>All the controlled dose studies are most useful only in the evaluation of 
						hypersensitive tests such as urinalysis; that is, tests that are at risks of 
						producing interpretive false positives due to passive internal drug exposure.</P>
					<P>Certainly controlled dose studies provide no information on the effects that 
						invasive tactics have on the clinical sensitivity of forensic tests.</P>
					<P>Because of these problems, we decided to evaluate clinical sensitivities of hair 
						testing by two different and more effective approaches.</P>
					<P>One involves blind studies where the detection rate of hair analysis is compared 
						to self report of drug use.</P>
					<P>Naturally, self reports were obtained under non-punitive research conditions.</P>
					<P>The second approach consists in blind side by side comparisons of the detection 
						efficiency of hair and urine testing.</P>
					<P>We proposed the term relative sensitivity studies for this latter approach.</P>
					<P>The relative sensitivity studies were performed under three conditions. One was 
						where evasive tactics against urinalysis could not be applied -- e.g. with 
						arrestee populations.</P>
					<P>Two, under conditions where evasive tactics against urinalysis were not easily 
						applied -- e.g., unannounced observed urine testing of parolees.</P>
					<P>Third, under conditions where evasion of the urine testing was easy, e.g., 
						pre-employment testing.</P>
					<P>The relative sensitivity studies would be illustrated with marijuana and cocaine 
						assays. For doing this we compared the most challenging hair test -- that is, 
						the marijuana assay -- to the most effective urine test.</P>
					<P>On the other extreme of the testing spectrum, we have the most effective hair 
						test, cocaine, compared to the urine test, whose three-day detection window is 
						considerably shorter than that for marijuana.</P>
					<P>Let me illustrate the self report method with a blind study that we have 
						performed with Dr. Tashkin at UCLA. Here we see that the very light marijuana 
						users, taking between .15 to .85 joints per week, were detected with an 
						efficiency of 29 percent by RIA.</P>
					<P>Those using one to three joints per week were detected with 89 percent 
						efficiency by RIA and mass spec. All the three heavier use categories were 
						detected with 100 percent efficiency.</P>
					<P>The overall sensitivity for the marijuana assay was 88 percent. The detection 
						efficiency or clinical sensitivities of the other assays are shown in the next 
						slide.</P>
					<P>They are, for cocaine 88 percent, opiates 83 percent -- they are 83 percent for 
						PCP, 88 for opiates and 96 percent for cocaine.</P>
					<P>A blind study evaluating the clinical sensitivities of the meth amphetamine 
						assays is currently in progress.</P>
					<P>With respect to the relative sensitivity studies we see, as we expect, that as 
						the detection opportunities increase, that you get worse results for urine.</P>
					<P>So, in the case of marijuana, the marijuana assay in arrestee populations is 
						about the same as for urine. It is 35 percent better under moderate evasive 
						conditions, under probation conditions. Under applicants it is 600 percent more 
						efficient, meaning the hair assay detection.</P>
					<P>When it comes to cocaine where no evasion is possible, 92 percent is the 
						advantage of cocaine. With moderate evasion, 272 percent
					</P>
					<P>and with applicant it is 1,580 percent. Thank you.</P>
					<P>(Applause.)</P>
					<P>DR. HUESTIS: Thank you, Dr. Baumgartner. We will now have the panel available 
						for questions from the Drug Testing Advisory Board and other panel members.</P>
					<P>DR. WILKINS: Actually, I will just ask one question and then give up the 
						microphone and then probably come back for some more later, if that is okay.</P>
					<P>I have one question for Dr. Baumgartner. Several times in your talk you 
						mentioned that you had literature references for some of the data that you were 
						providing.</P>
					<P>I wondered if it would be possible if you could give us a list of those so that 
						we could then go and collect those and review those at our leisure.</P>
					<P>There was a lot of data to look at in a very short period of time and I think it 
						would help us review it appropriately if we could just have the names of the 
						articles and then we could go find them.</P>
					<P>DR. BAUMGARTNER: The literature references can be found in a review article that 
						I wrote. It was in the book on hair testing edited by -</P>
					<P>DR. WILKINS: Is this the KIMS Drug Testing and Hair?</P>
					<P>DR. BAUMGARTNER: Yes, that is right. It is the CRC thing
					</P>
					<P>that came out about a year ago.</P>
					<P>DR. WILKINS: And the data presented in the tables are also referenced in there?</P>
					<P>DR. BAUMGARTNER: It is obtained from there, yes.</P>
					<P>DR. KWONG: I have a question for Dr. Niedbala about saliva.
					</P>
					<P>If you call oral fluid and saliva a mixture of secretion from three different 
						glands and the constituents could vary with stimulation and flow, and there are 
						a number of different devices out there, has anyone looked at whether different 
						devices can give you a different saliva composition and whether that would 
						affect you clinical outcome?</P>
					<P>DR. NIEDBALA: I can tell you, we have done some work with saliva, for instance, 
						that has been collected from individuals dosed with -- I will use cocaine as an 
						example.</P>
					<P>We have done both random studies as well as controlled dose studies. The results 
						appear to be similar.</P>
					<P>There is a lot of work that needs to be done yet looking at single dose versus 
						chronic dose with every one of these drugs of abuse.
					</P>
					<P>With time we expect to do that, one analyte at a time. So, for the moment I have 
						to say yes, at least for a few of the devices. Mostly whole saliva versus the 
						Epitope device versus the
					</P>
					<P>Saliva Diagnostics devices. But as far as Avatar or dental cotton, I have not 
						done studies to compare all of those.</P>
					<P>DR. KWONG: A related question on collection. Analyte concentrations are lower 
						than what we are familiar with in urine. You mentioned that your GC/MS 
						confirmation procedure will be more sensitive, too.</P>
					<P>My question is, are there any limitations on how much those devices can collect 
						to give you a sufficient volume?</P>
					<P>DR. NIEDBALA: Yes, generally it is somewhere between -- again, I will use 
						Epitope because I have the most experience with it.</P>
					<P>You will collect saliva, a few hundred microliters, and then put that into a 
						test tube which has a diluent. The diluent has preservatives, some detergent, 
						some colorant.</P>
					<P>What you will get back at the lab is somewhere between I believe 1.2 and 1.5 
						mls.</P>
					<P>So, the challenge is not only in the screening test where you need to use the 
						minimum amount of fluid to perform your panel of tests, but also in your 
						confirmation. I know Tim Rohrig will be addressing some of that in the next 
						presentation.</P>
					<P>DR. CONE: For the saliva and sweat testing, one of the problematic things that I 
						think you face is the simplicity that toxicologists like myself like to think 
						in terms of, like expressions of cut offs and things in terms of concentrations 
						of nanograms per something.</P>
					<P>In your case you are saying, I think in some respects, it is nanograms per 
						device. That is a tough one, I think, in terms of setting realistic cut offs, 
						especially as more products proliferate and you want to do cross comparisons 
						between them.</P>
					<P>I think you need a much better standard for setting cut offs than nanograms per 
						device.</P>
					<P>DR. ARMBRUSTER: Dr. Cone, when you say nanograms per device, we do use nanograms 
						per ml. I guess I am missing your --</P>
					<P>DR. CONE: But that is not milliliter of sweat. That is milliliter of solution 
						you add.</P>
					<P>DR. ARMBRUSTER: That is a good point. Unfortunately, with only 15 minutes, I 
						have had to delimitate the discussion of the elution of the sweat off the sweat 
						patch. You are raising a good point there.</P>
					<P>I guess what you are getting at is that we follow our protocol and somebody with 
						a different protocol for a different sweat collection device, it may be a 
						matter of comparing apples and oranges.
					</P>
					<P>DR. CONE: That is part of it. Inherent in the device that you are working with, 
						of course, is that you don't have a volume.</P>
					<P>I think this is something to think about and to struggle with. I don't know what 
						the immediate solution is. I just know that it is problematic when you start 
						comparing nanograms per your device versus nanograms per somebody else's 
						device. The same is true for saliva as well.</P>
					<P>DR. ARMBRUSTER: Just as spit happens, sweat happens. We don't all sweat the same 
						amount. It is true. Thus, with our device, if you are a heavy sweater, and you 
						are also a drug user, presumably you will accumulate more drug, et cetera. So, 
						it will be easier to detect an individual that is a drug user and a sweater.</P>
					<P>DR. NIEDBALA: I think there is one other point that goes along with that and I 
						had written it down and forgot to talk about it, which is some sort of testing 
						to make sure that the sample is adequate.
					</P>
					<P>With urine we do pH, creatinine, specific gravity. We have choices to make sure 
						that we have a valid specimen. With saliva, we can look at things like human 
						IgG, which is a simple test to do, especially in a microtiter plate format, to 
						make sure that you have a specimen that is valid, that has collected a 
						sufficient amount of material.</P>
					<P>Actually in the literature there are a few publications, and saliva in 
						particular, which deal with what is the amount of IgG that you would normally 
						find in saliva.</P>
					<P>DR. CONE: Sort of like a creatinine correction.</P>
					<P>DR. NIEDBALA: Yes.</P>
					<P>DR. ARMBRUSTER: And for sweat at one time we were looking at lactic acid 
						byproducts.</P>
					<P>DR. CONE: A comment for Dr. Baumgartner and perhaps a response from him. Your 
						description of how you cite cut offs does not give me a warm, fuzzy feeling.</P>
					<P>The use of self report data is one way of approaching the problem, I suspect, 
						but it is not a very satisfying approach.</P>
					<P>I do think that you need controlled dosing studies to evaluate what is the time 
						course of detection, individual variability response and so forth.</P>
					<P>Your self report data doesn't do everything that it needs to do, I think, and 
						let me just tell you about some personal experiences with drug addicts over the 
						years.</P>
					<P>We have had documented cases of people in treatment who we were monitoring. 
						There were no punitive actions taken as a result of them telling us the truth.</P>
					<P>We consistently got people who just simply lied for apparently the fun of it. We 
						have a classic example -- this is not an isolated example. It happens many 
						times.</P>
					<P>I had a lady in treatment who was tested three times a week over a period of six 
						months. We had a total of several hundred positive cocaine specimens.</P>
					<P>Each and every time she was asked she always said no. I guess she was following 
						somebody's advice. But it is just not a satisfying approach to setting a cut 
						off, to be asking people and correlating what is asked.</P>
					<P>DR. BAUMGARTNER: Yes, I would certainly like to add to this, Ed, first of all, 
						we have correlations within populations. So, we do pick out outliers.</P>
					<P>We also can get self reports which you can rarely get when you do controlled 
						dose studies.</P>
					<P>Thirdly, with the hair analysis you notice that we are not a hypersensitive 
						test. I think ethical considerations would totally prohibit giving people 
						dosing anywhere near our cut off level. Those are three considerations.</P>
					<P>DR. JONES: A couple of questions to you, Dr. Armbruster.
					</P>
					<P>Were the data in figure one and three generated with the same microtiter plate, 
						no changes in the assay?</P>
					<P>The assay was there and you were just varying concentrations of analyte in the 
						specimens?</P>
					<P>DR. ARMBRUSTER: Yes, that is something that I wanted to bring out, as we get 
						into the confirmatory assay. All of those specimens were tested by GC/MS, the 
						gold standard for reference.</P>
					<P>Thus, they were determined to be positive or negative based on GC/MS. So, we 
						knew the GC/MS values. Then we could assign cut off points.</P>
					<P>DR. JONES: That is what I assumed. I just wanted to clarify. Could you clarify 
						for me what the analytes were as you go from class to class of drugs in those?</P>
					<P>DR. ARMBRUSTER: Yes, for cocaine it was cocaine. For meth amphetamine, it was 
						meth amphetamine. For the amphetamines, it was meth amphetamine. PCP was PCP. 
						THC was THC.</P>
					<P>For the opiates, if I recall correctly, it was heroin and morphine, so not just 
						one but data from both analytes.</P>
					<P>DR. JONES: Thank you. A quick question from you, Sam.
					</P>
					<P>What do you know about adulterants in saliva. I pop a Certs in my mouth or I 
						throw a piece of candy in or something during that collection.</P>
					<P>DR. NIEDBALA: For adulterants in saliva, actually the way I deal with that with 
						us is all the experience we have had with saliva alcohol.</P>
					<P>The QED on site test was the first one cleared by the DOT.
					</P>
					<P>We had to answer that question 10 different ways. That is a different 
						technology, so I have to throw in that caveat.</P>
					<P>Knowing what can, in that particular case, affect that technology, all we had to 
						do were the experiments to design a protocol by which people waited before 
						their specimen was collected.</P>
					<P>In that particular case, it is 10 minutes after they had drunk or eaten 
						anything. After that period of time, we were very safe in collecting the 
						specimen and getting an accurate result.</P>
					<P>Also, in the QED technology, if we did allow them to take the specimen 
						prematurely, it always caused a false positive. Never did we have a false 
						negative.</P>
					<P>I thought that was rather interesting. In the bigger picture, especially with 
						alcohol, what we are trying to do is keep people from getting into trouble by 
						hurting other people or themselves, in many situations.</P>
					<P>What that did is, it gave us a little bit of confidence that we could not find a 
						way to cause a false negative.</P>
					<P>With immunoassay, because of the technology that we chose to do the alternate 
						fluids is heterogeneous, meaning that there is a separation step.</P>
					<P>In many cases, any adulterants that have been tried -- with the Epitope device 
						there has been anything from soda to foods to maybe 20 different adulterants 
						that we tested.</P>
					<P>We believe that because we used a heterogeneous technique -- meaning, we wash it 
						before we add in the color development step -- we remove the effects of the 
						adulterants.</P>
					<P>DR. JONES: I wanted to ask from a one liner from each of the panelists, if I 
						may. As we are looking at the potential of multiple immunoassays for multiple 
						devices, what are your feelings on attempts to standardize the responses of 
						these immunoassay based systems in terms of
					</P>
					<P>their ability to discriminate.</P>
					<P>I realize that we have got cut off issues, and that is not what I am asking you 
						about. What I am asking you about is the ability of these immunoassays to 
						discriminate reliably between a positive and a negative at or around whatever 
						that cut off may be.</P>
					<P>Should we try to establish standards there or how should we respond to those 
						types of questions in the various matrices that we have.</P>
					<P>We have got something from your end, so Tony, you are off the hook in one sense.</P>
					<P>DR. ARMBRUSTER: I think we have work to do in sweat testing. We have tests that 
						are FDA approved. We can use them. I think we can probably further improve the 
						discriminatory ability of our assays.</P>
					<P>I am always concerned with being able to definitely get enough signal generated 
						for change in analyte concentration that we have clear separation from a 
						negative and a positive.</P>
					<P>That is the same thing we have in urine now. When we get into trouble, it is 
						when that assay collapses and we don't have that big leap between negative and 
						positive.</P>
					<P>It is going to be a trial and error process, I think, and I am sure we can do 
						better and we need to keep working in that direction. DR. TOWT: Since we are on 
						the urine based screen, we would
					</P>
					<P>be very similar to that. Obviously it is important to establish concentrations 
						that are meaningful.</P>
					<P>Again, it depends on the purpose of your screen. Is it to catch everyone or is 
						it to be very safe and not produce any false positives.</P>
					<P>DR. NIEDBALA: If I had to write a statement or something I would vote for 
						something like the phrase of free market interrogation of specimens based on 
						good, scientific studies.</P>
					<P>DR. BAUMGARTNER: My point is that the radio immunoassay screens that we are 
						using are by far more sensitive than the mass spectrometry that we use at the 
						cut off.</P>
					<P>We had absolutely no problem identifying drug users. But the key issue is to 
						confirm them with forensic certainty.</P>
					<P>So, in one respect the immunoassay serves really nothing more than a commercial 
						purpose. You have some cross reactivity just on confirming.</P>
					<P>Our assays, as you notice, are far more sensitive. Of course, we only use ultra 
						sensitive mass spectrometry. It is just that we were lucky to have ultra ultra 
						sensitive radio immunoassays using one milligram of hair. We can use two or 
						three milligrams and it makes it even more sensitive.</P>
					<P>DR. WALSH: I have a quick question for Dr. Baumgartner about how you 
						characterized the clinical sensitivity of the assays.</P>
					<P>The way I interpreted the slide is that if I kept my heroin use down below 1.9 
						bags a week and cocaine to less than 250 milligrams per month, that I would get 
						a negative result?</P>
					<P>DR. BAUMGARTNER: Correct. In spite of that, this hair identifies so many more 
						drug users because you have the big gaps in the urine tests being randomly 
						supplied. It just simply misses the target.
					</P>
					<P>DR. PEAT: I have a practical question, and Tony is off the hook on this one, 
						too. Obviously the trend in the drug lab is to run thousands of specimens today 
						for cost effective, economic reasons.</P>
					<P>What are the cost effective ways of automating the sweat patch, saliva and hair 
						testing?</P>
					<P>DR. ARMBRUSTER: In automating the screening?</P>
					<P>DR. PEAT: Yes, in automating the immunoassay techniques. DR. ARMBRUSTER: 
						Currently with the microtiter well plates it is a 96 place well. You are 
						dealing with a fairly large number of specimens that you are testing at once.</P>
					<P>With RIA you are dealing with large batch sizes, too, theoretically, depending 
						on how many you have.</P>
					<P>Automation that we use includes automated pipetting devices such as T-CANS. We 
						could further attempt to automate some of those processes.</P>
					<P>Already with T-CANS there is a minimum of manual testing that is going on. The 
						biggest thing is physically removing the plates from the T-CAN and sitting it 
						on a counter or in a drawer to incubate in the dark.</P>
					<P>DR. NIEDBALA: My experience also comes because STC deals in the blood bank and 
						plasma industry, where microtiter is very readily used.</P>
					<P>We have technology that we use and instrumentation systems with software and 
						hardware that is FDA cleared that can test up to 1,200 specimens an hour, to 
						give you an idea of through put.</P>
					<P>DR. BAUMGARTNER: Our procedures are similarly automated, meaning that we use 
						automated pipetting. That is really all that we can do, because we have to 
						centrifuge and so on, like most competitive immunoassays using double antibody 
						methods.</P>
					<P>DR. SELAVKA: A lot has been said today about pharmacologic relevance. That is 
						the first time I really heard that applied, that it is a necessity.</P>
					<P>I think if we look historically at urine drug testing, there is some -- I guess 
						I will put Tony and Dr. Towt on the spot on this as opposed to the other 
						matrices.
					</P>
					<P>Can you tell me something about, or I challenge you to describe the 
						pharmacologic relevance of PCP at 25 nanograms per ml in urine or amphetamines 
						at 1,000.</P>
					<P>DR. COSTANTINO: While I am not all that familiar with the historical 
						determination of the PCP cut off at 25, we do know that any PCP at all is 
						important.</P>
					<P>I don't know about the enzyme immunoassay technology as far as how it has been 
						challenged with regard to sensitivity. I think that is one assay where any 
						sensitivity that is accurate and precise will be useful.</P>
					<P>DR. TOWT: My understanding is that some of these cut offs were based on what 
						could be detected at the time they were made.</P>
					<P>Then as far as amphetamine, you had all the broad over the counter amphetamine 
						related products that were pharmacologically relevant.</P>
					<P>So, you wanted to make sure you didn't screen for those particular compounds.</P>
					<P>DR. SELAVKA: I guess just to be clear on the answers and the question I am 
						asking, it seems to me that if you use ROC plots, those are affected by the 
						matrix in which you do it, the analyte package in that matrix, and in fact the 
						immunoassay that you choose and its titer.</P>
					<P>Every time you do one of these ROC based cut off selections, every other 
						laboratory would either have to use the same cut offs -- every other laboratory 
						would have to follow the procedure with the same analyte package in mind and 
						the same matrix with the same titer on the same immunoassay or those cut offs 
						will not carry across different laboratories.</P>
					<P>You actually have to have standardization. I think that is maybe what Dr. Jones 
						was trying to bring up in his question.</P>
					<P>DR. CAPLAN: One semi-announcement on behalf of the board, is that those who have 
						given presentations today, if you have not made your slides or text available, 
						please do so. It is going to be very difficult to follow some of the things 
						that were suggested without having the opportunity to look at the figure again.</P>
					<P>I just had a couple of quick other things that were not clear to me. One with 
						sweat. When you were going through those things, it appeared to me that you 
						were looking for THC and BE.</P>
					<P>You mentioned cocaine. Are we looking at a mixture of the two types of drugs?</P>
					<P>DR. ARMBRUSTER: Are you referring to the ROC curve in particular?</P>
					<P>DR. CAPLAN: I am not sure. I think you had it listed on that curve, but when you 
						just answered the question before you said you had -- that the assay response 
						was all parent drugs.</P>
					<P>I think the whole list of drugs was parent drugs. Is that the case, or do you 
						find a mixture of drug, metabolite --</P>
					<P>DR. ARMBRUSTER: Basically, the major drug that we find in sweat is cocaine, the 
						parent drug. There will be metabolites of cocaine present in the sweat.</P>
					<P>The peculiar nature of the sweat is that we do see primarily parent drug rather 
						than metabolite, just the opposite of what we see in urine.</P>
					<P>So, the assay is really -- it should be really optimized for cocaine.</P>
					<P>DR. CAPLAN: That is a point. The question is whether or not the assays that we 
						currently use need to be optimized for what we might call cross reactants today 
						if we switch to other matrices.</P>
					<P>DR. ARMBRUSTER: That is exactly one of the problems we had with the 
						immunoassays, is that they are geared to be optimal for the metabolites that we 
						see in urine.</P>
					<P>It is a different picture, a different story in terms of the analytes that we 
						see in sweat. That is why not everybody was willing to jump and develop an 
						immunoassay for us, because they would have to modify their antibodies perhaps.</P>
					<P>DR. CAPLAN: I think it is important that we differentiate and understand, since 
						this session is dealing with the initial screening and its capability.</P>
					<P>That ability is going to be dictated by the assay and the assays may not all be 
						out there that we need today. We may have far better assays that have greater 
						sensitivity for these analytes that might make some of the products which now 
						have low concentrations more amenable to be useful for a longer period of time, 
						and I don't think we have answered that question.</P>
					<P>If anybody else has a comment on that in the group, I would like to hear that. I 
						think it is a fundamental question of apples and oranges.</P>
					<P>As we shift technologies and use a particular assay, what is that assay really 
						measuring and can we make assays which will do a better job.</P>
					<P>That brings me, if nobody has another comment, back to hair.
					</P>
					<P>I am not clear on -- I know you have made your own antibody mixes and you are 
						talking about various sensitivities compared to an epidemiological 
						identification as opposed to an analytical one.</P>
					<P>Can you clarify exactly what you think the THC assay is actually measuring? It 
						was unclear to me from the slide you put up what we are actually detecting when 
						we look at THC.</P>
					<P>DR. BAUMGARTNER: With the RIA we are measuring a substance that has not been 
						characterized. It is not carboxy THC in THC because the patented method removes 
						these in order to remove the universally present cross reacting substance.</P>
					<P>We have a very high statistical correlation between the positives that we get by 
						RIA and of course what we confirm by MS when we measure carboxy THC.</P>
					<P>It is somewhat similar to what is happening in urine. In urine an RIA positive 
						doesn't correlate too well with what the carboxy THC level is that you are 
						obtaining.</P>
					<P>As we know, the 500 or so -- 50 or so or the 500 compounds that are present in 
						marijuana have been identified. So, it is a substance that has chemical 
						properties that allow the separation from the cross reacting substance to be 
						made.</P>
					<P>DR. CAPLAN: Are you saying that on the one hand you have confirmed a number of 
						these with mass spec, but there is another population that is not confirmed, 
						but only statistically or epidemiologically confirmed with other studies?</P>
					<P>DR. BAUMGARTNER: Just like with urinalysis, yes.</P>
					<P>DR. CAPLAN: I don't think that is the case with urinalysis. DR. BAUMGARTNER: My 
						understanding is that when you have an RIA positive, that the RIA positive 
						value doesn't particularly well correlate with the carboxy THC levels.</P>
					<P>DR. CAPLAN: That is true, but we wouldn't call something a positive unless we 
						had the other confirmation. You are suggesting that if we are to use RIA in 
						hair testing, that we should call something positive without a GC/MS or MS/MS 
						confirmation.</P>
					<P>DR. BAUMGARTNER: Oh, absolutely not. Absolutely not. It is simply, we call only 
						those positives that confirm for carboxy THC. DR. CAPLAN: You don't offer that 
						for purposes where it is not confirmed.</P>
					<P>DR. BAUMGARTNER: That is right. We don't do that.</P>
					<P>DR. PINDER: Referring to the question with saliva, and possible interfering 
						substances, I wonder if you looked into materials that could change the pH of 
						the mouth, perhaps sodium bicarbonate or something even more alkaline, that 
						might affect the concentration of drugs and saliva, and could be held in the 
						saliva in the mouth for quite a period of time.</P>
					<P>DR. NIEDBALA: I have actually addressed that issue slightly differently. I don't 
						have enough human studies to have looked at different pHs in different mouths 
						at different points in time.</P>
					<P>What I can control is from the moment of collection through the initial testing 
						on to confirmation.</P>
					<P>With saliva, during the collection process -- again, I have to use Epitope as 
						the example because I haven't studied each and every one of these collection 
						devices -- the pad has some buffered materials on it that are patented to 
						encourage mucosal transudate collection into the pad.</P>
					<P>Then that is placed into a buffered solution. So, by the time the screening 
						assay sees it -- which is really where I have spent a lot of my time -- 
						everything is in a very nice, neat matrix for me.</P>
					<P>So, there is really no way exactly to answer your question without I guess going 
						back to some basic physiologic studies.</P>
					<P>The PKA calculations that have been done in the past are based, in part, exactly 
						on calculations versus how could we do a controlled study of that. That is 
						never really been done.</P>
					<P>I know from some of the clinical -- again, controlled dose as well as randomized 
						studies -- that it doesn't appear to be quite true in all cases, or at least we 
						are not seeing a lot of aberrance that we can't explain in any way, shape or 
						form.</P>
					<P>I don't think that the pH of the mouth is really varying so much that there is 
						not enough drug for us to pick up, as far as interrogating those specimens by 
						immunoassay.</P>
					<P>DR. PINDER: One question in regard to hair, Dr. Baumgartner. I believe you said 
						that following enzymatic digestion of the hair melanin is removed. I wonder if 
						you could go into that process a little further.</P>
					<P>Is the analyte removed during that process? Is the analyte closely associated 
						with the melanin and is some of it lost when the melanin is removed?</P>
					<P>DR. BAUMGARTNER: Yes, that is a very interesting question.
					</P>
					<P>First of all, melanin can trap the analyte within the structure, or it binds 
						very strongly to melanin.</P>
					<P>Now, if you have a strongly binding interaction, this would not be removed. With 
						Dr. Cone's study that he published, you get loose binding. Dr. Cone didn't wash 
						it off. That is one of the points.</P>
					<P>So, the issue of if you have strong binding to melanin within the structure, our 
						method, it does not produce morphological changes to the melanin.</P>
					<P>As I said, strong binding is strong binding. In other words, the material is not 
						liberated. It is strongly bound.</P>
					<P>DR. PINDER: I am not quite clear on that. Are you saying that in some cases 
						there is strong binding and in other cases there isn't?</P>
					<P>DR. BAUMGARTNER: No, we have not observed any strong binding. Dr. Cone has found 
						some binding to it, but it is weak binding.
					</P>
					<P>You can wash it off.</P>
					<P>To give you another example, if you take hair samples that have different 
						porosities, you can get 10-fold more when you do soaking studies. You can get 
						10-fold more material into per unit time however
					</P>
					<P>long you soak it. Then when you apply a wash technique, you remove it. The 
						question is, what do these artificial studies have to do, when you do the 
						washing, with what goes on in the real world.</P>
					<P>When we looked at racial bias or hair color bias in the real world, Dr. 
						Michkowski's studies with real populations showed no racial bias effect.</P>
					<P>We have to deal with this question really to evaluate it in the real world. We 
						have done that with cocaine.</P>
					<P>Therefore, Dr. Cone's data has no bearing at all to the real world. It is an in 
						vitro study and it has some interest and I think Ed probably will agree with me 
						on this.</P>
					<P>DR. PINDER: I see.</P>
					<P>DR. CONE: Just to add to the comments, we characterize both high affinity and 
						low affinity of melanin to cocaine.</P>
					<P>We used classical drug receptor techniques to evaluate the binding 
						characteristics. What we were most interested in was the question Dick Pinder 
						asked.</P>
					<P>If drug is bound to melanin, will it be released during the digestion step. We 
						found that 95 percent of the cocaine that is bound to melanin is released in 
						the digestion step to the supernatant, such that we see no value, in essence, 
						in spinning down the pellet particle and saying that it is removing any 
						potential binding as such, because it is released into the supernatant during 
						the digestion step.</P>
					<P>I will give you an opportunity to comment on that if you want, but I would like 
						to ask you a different question.</P>
					<P>DR. BAUMGARTNER: The release on the digestion step that you pointed out, first 
						of all, your high affinity was low. I think your paper showed non-specific 
						binding and some binding. You didn't develop any equilibrium constants on this.</P>
					<P>Secondly, you did an adsorption study on the surface. We are talking about the 
						trapping and of course you have got to come up with an equilibrium constant.</P>
					<P>Then of course the final proof of the pudding is the real world studies with 
						these 1,200 samples, and not seeing -- getting the same results for urinalysis, 
						then hair analysis.</P>
					<P>I think that is the final answer to the issue, you know, when these three 
						different approaches show nothing is going on between racial groups with 
						cocaine, I think that settles the matter, no matter what in vitro studies and 
						sophistications we can play.</P>
					<P>DR. CONE: Just to follow up, I would like to ask you a different question. I am 
						really confused. I thought I understood what you said, but I believe you were 
						describing the marijuana screening assay.</P>
					<P>I thought I picked up, and then I thought you confirmed that you remove the 
						carboxy acid metabolite during your washing step?</P>
					<P>DR. BAUMGARTNER: No. In order to remove the interfering cross reacting substance 
						that is universally present in hair, in the removal process, in the screening 
						acid, this THC and carboxy THC go.</P>
					<P>We can't come up with methods that remove the two interfering substance with the 
						other. The reason is that it is a lipophilic(?) substance.</P>
					<P>DR. CONE: My real question is, what is the unknown substance. Did I not 
						understand you to say that in the screening assay for THC that you do not know 
						what you are testing for, or that you have characterized it but you haven't 
						said what it is.</P>
					<P>DR. BAUMGARTNER: No, when I say an unknown substance tautologically it means an 
						unknown substance is an unknown substance, of which there are many, as you 
						know.</P>
					<P>The point about this substance is that it has a high affinity for the carboxy 
						THC and THC antibody that we are using.</P>
					<P>DR. CONE: But you have not characterized it. You do not know what it is.</P>
					<P>DR. BAUMGARTNER: I understand there are still several hundred uncharacterized 
						things. As far as we know, the main thing is that it does the job, that we 
						analyze it and that it correlates with use.</P>
					<P>Just as there seem to be a lot of unknown substances in urine that we haven't 
						characterized, characterization doesn't help.
					</P>
					<P>The important thing is that the substance has a cross reactivity with the 
						antibodies.</P>
					<P>DR. CONE: Is it related to THC or to the marijuana plant or do you know what it 
						is related to?</P>
					<P>DR. BAUMGARTNER: I like to dream about it and say it is the unknown substance -- 
						okay, the cross reacting substance, I speculated, could be a natural ligand. It 
						is just a fantasy.</P>
					<P>What this comes from? It is found in marijuana.</P>
					<P>DR. CONE: Or possibly produced as a pyrolysis metabolite, or not metabolite but 
						pyrolysis product.</P>
					<P>DR. BAUMGARTNER: I don't know. It is internalized and then it ends up in hair.</P>
					<P>DR. CAPLAN: I am going to ask the same question as I asked before. If that is 
						the case, when you do the test in the laboratory and you get a presumptive 
						positive and you confirm it by GC/MS/MS, what are you confirming by MS/MS?</P>
					<P>DR. BAUMGARTNER: Carboxy THC.</P>
					<P>DR. CAPLAN: So, you are saying that every time this unknown substance appears, 
						carboxy THC is confirmed.</P>
					<P>DR. BAUMGARTNER: It is a very strong correlation, very strong, just like with 
						urine.</P>
					<P>DR. CAPLAN: Very strong correlation; is it every time or you don't report it?</P>
					<P>DR. BAUMGARTNER: No, it is not every time. But we correlated also with 
						cannabinol, cannabidiol and so on, so there are other things. But we don't use 
						those in confirmations.</P>
					<P>But just like with urine, not every RIA positive can be confirmed with mass 
						spectrometry.</P>
					<P>DR. CAPLAN: I understand that and that is very clear. The question is whether or 
						not you report on the presumptive, unknown entity, where every time you get 
						this unknown entity or positive initial response, then you go to, before you go 
						to report a response to a client, you go to GC/MS/MS and get a confirmation of 
						carboxy THC.</P>
					<P>DR. BAUMGARTNER: Absolutely. DR. CAPLAN: That always occurs?
					</P>
					<P>DR. BAUMGARTNER: Absolutely, 101 percent. That is the safety net part. The one 
						percent is the safety net.</P>
					<P>DR. PEAT: I am going to continue the discussion. What is the correlation between 
						the RIA reactive and the GS/MS confirmation or the GC/MS/MS confirmation?</P>
					<P>DR. BAUMGARTNER: You saw that. It depends on the dose.</P>
					<P>DR. PEAT: Not in the controlled studies, but in the random population that you 
						looked at. What is the correlation?</P>
					<P>DR. BAUMGARTNER: That is a variable, depending on those factors which we don't 
						quite understand.</P>
					<P>DR. PEAT: Fifty percent, seventy-five percent?</P>
					<P>DR. BAUMGARTNER: It is on the order of 60 percent.</P>
					<P>DR. JONES: One quick question or one quick comment, particularly to you, Dr. 
						Baumgartner. As a board member, I would find it extremely useful if I had some 
						form of a document that describes the procedure.</P>
					<P>I thought I walked into here knowing a little bit about hair testing, and you 
						have successfully totally confused me. That is for sure.</P>
					<P>Your slides, you had a series of slides that we did not have. If you could 
						supply us with those slides and also with some sort of documentation that 
						describes the hair testing procedure that you are purporting to be utilizing, I 
						would find it very useful.</P>
					<P>DR. BAUMGARTNER: I would like to make a point. Obviously 15 minutes is a very 
						short time and a lot of my papers are out there, all of which I would be happy 
						to supply.</P>
					<P>DR. JONES: I would like to interject. I think this was titled test reagents and 
						procedures. We heard a lot of documentation about the hair testing protocols 
						there.</P>
					<P>I would just like procedures. We have another session, I believe, that talks 
						about interpretation of results.</P>
					<P>DR. BAUMGARTNER: Yes, I have a lot to say in the interpretation of results 
						section, too.</P>
					<P>DR. HUESTIS: Okay, our time is almost up. I have a couple of comments. I think 
						there has been a lot of interesting information presented.</P>
					<P>A few of the things that I am still interested in are the issues that Dr. Jones 
						approached, the issue of cross reactivity profiles between the different 
						reagents.</P>
					<P>I think we didn't talk about precision, which maybe we will get to in the 
						quality control, but certainly the precision of the assay will affect the 
						ability of the assay to separate positive from negatives.</P>
					<P>Another issue is the stability of analytes of interest in the matrices, in the 
						different matrices and in the different collection devices.</P>
					<P>Certainly I think issues about windows of detection and also the amount and type 
						of QC that is required, which we will discuss later on.</P>
					<P>Another issue is, someone has lost a wallet. So, if you look around as you get 
						up and if you would return it to the people outside at the registration desk?</P>
					<P>I would like to thank all of our presenters very much for their interesting 
						presentations.</P>
					<P>(Applause.)</P>
					<P>DR. BUSH: I would like to take this opportunity, before we break, to ask Dr. 
						Niedbala and Dr. Baumgartner to share your slides. Give us your slides today.</P>
					<P>There were a couple in there, Dr. Niedbala, at the very front end of your talk 
						that we did not have. I would like to make copies of them. Thank you, sir.</P>
					<P>Dr. Baumgartner, if we could copy your slides, we will have them back to you 
						tomorrow, so that we can include these in the discussions for the advisory 
						board.</P>
					<P>(Brief recess.)</P>
					<P>DR. BUSH: This is the last session of the afternoon and we are a few minutes 
						late in beginning. So, while you are quietly resuming your seats, I would like 
						to take the opportunity to begin the last panel session for the day.</P>
					<P>This is the confirmatory test procedures panel. Our moderator is Dr. Richard 
						Hilderbrand.</P>
					<P>Richard Hilderbrand received a PhD from the University of Illinois, Medical 
						Center Campus, Chicago, Illinois.</P>
					<P>He is currently the director for administration at the UCLA Olympic Analytical 
						Laboratory, and is involved with the analytical programs to reduce the abuse of 
						performance enhancing drugs by athletes.
					</P>
					<P>Dr. Hilderbrand has worked in various areas of biochemical and toxicological 
						research. He has edited one scientific volume, contributed chapters and 
						published a number of scientific articles and abstracts. He is an inspector for 
						the National Lab Certification Program.</P>
					<P>Dr. Hilderbrand began his career with the U.S. Navy in 1972 at the Naval Medical 
						Research Unit One, University of California at Berkeley.</P>
					<P>His experience with drug abuse reduction includes managing a navy drug screening 
						laboratory and being a program manager for the navy drug screening program at 
						the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery in Washington, D.C.</P>
					<P>In August 1991, Dr. Hilderbrand became the science and testing officer for the 
						Secretary of Defense. He certified service drug testing laboratories and 
						advised the military services on drug abuse reduction programs.</P>
					<P>With that, I would like to thank and introduce Dr. Hilderbrand.</P>
					<P>Agenda Item: Confirmatory Test Procedures Panel.</P>
					<P>DR. HILDERBRAND: Thank you, Dr. Bush. I would like to take this opportunity to 
						thank the Drug Testing Advisory Board, Dr. Autry and all the members of this 
						august panel. Thank you for this opportunity.
					</P>
					<P>Welcome to all visitors, and I am really glad to see this level of interest in 
						the work place drug testing.</P>
					<P>The interesting thing about the work place program in confirmation procedures is 
						that there is really no standard other than an unequivocal result, when that is 
						reported as a positive.</P>
					<P>One can talk about optimizing the false positive and false negative results of a 
						test in a screening assay, but in a confirmation there is no real opportunity 
						to have a false positive from a work place specimen, in the regulated side, 
						especially.</P>
					<P>A total system has been developed over the years to maintain quality in the drug 
						testing laboratories. This total system has been outlined in a fairly detailed 
						manner this morning, so I won't go over that.</P>
					<P>The entire process is designed to ensure that there is no false positive result 
						going out on a positive.</P>
					<P>There is more latitude given on negatives. In other words, if a result is 
						reported negative, there is not a serious penalty for that. There can be 
						program impact, but the real penalty comes with reporting a false positive.</P>
					<P>The mainstay of this ability to ensure the positive result is gas chromatography 
						mass spectrometry.</P>
					<P>This particular procedure is specified at this time by the regulatory directive 
						that covers the drug testing program for regulated industries.</P>
					<P>This provides various types of information, not the least of which is the 
						analytical evidence that is used to document this result as a positive.</P>
					<P>Also, it provides the assurance that the level in the specimen is above the 
						specified testing level to report a positive.</P>
					<P>It provides information that nothing else in the specimen is going to result in 
						a positive report. So, we are looking for specificity as well.</P>
					<P>What I would really like to say is that there are a number of parts of the 
						confirmation test. This is not just the gas chromatography mass spectrometry.</P>
					<P>There is the preparation of the sample, starting with the hopefully 
						unadulterated clean sample that was collected for this drug testing.</P>
					<P>This specimen is subjected to an extraction process. That extraction process is 
						going to result in a generally concentrated and purified drug that can then be 
						prepared for the gas chromatograph by derivitization, so that it is amenable to 
						analysis in a gas chromatograph.</P>
					<P>Ultimately, then, it is subjected to the analysis in the mass spectrometry for 
						the unequivocal identification.</P>
					<P>The entire set of procedures must be considered when one is talking about a 
						confirmation procedure. It doesn't help to use gas chromatography mass 
						spectrometry if the quality of the specimen is not sufficient or if the 
						preparation is not sufficient.</P>
					<P>So, it is imperative that each sample be tested in an appropriate manner.</P>
					<P>The current federal regulations require a confirmation method that is 
						independent of the method of screening used and based on a different chemical 
						principle than the initial test.</P>
					<P>We have heard a great deal about immunoassays. I am sure that you are now going 
						to hear a great deal about GC/MS and extractions. In addition, this procedure 
						must be capable of quantitating
					</P>
					<P>over a reasonable range. Generally this quantitative range is going to be the 
						pharmacologically relevant value or the arbitrarily set value, however one 
						wants to view the determination of the cut offs.</P>
					<P>The analysis must provide a quantitative range around that level, and this must 
						be reproducible.</P>
					<P>One must be able to take this same sample to another laboratory and come up with 
						a reasonably close analytical result. This, of course, is monitored by the 
						proficiency testing.
					</P>
					<P>If this entire procedure, as applied in a laboratory, does not provide a plus or 
						minus 20 percent or plus or minus two standard deviations range in the 
						analytical procedure, it is not going to be satisfactory. At this time, GC/MS 
						does provide this.</P>
					<P>It has to -- I will add these. These are not out of regulatory writing. But it 
						has to provide a sufficient -- the sample has to provide a sufficient quantity 
						of sample to allow for a confirmation, a retest, for repeats.</P>
					<P>Say that there is an analytical problem. So, there are some real sample 
						requirements that are required for the confirmation procedure.</P>
					<P>It has to be of a reasonable cost and of a sensitivity to allow a reasonable 
						window of detection.</P>
					<P>The National Laboratory Certification Program now enjoys such well developed 
						methods that we can rely on the results that are reported, and we are capable 
						of providing detection and deterrents and it is working very effectively.</P>
					<P>There are essentially no false positives and a tolerable false negative rate.</P>
					<P>The integrity of the program demands no less. So, as we evaluate any alternative 
						sample, any alternative technology, we must keep in mind that this is a process 
						and not a single test and that there is a lot of quality built into a drug 
						testing laboratory.</P>
					<P>With that, I will introduce the first speaker Dr. Timothy Rohrig is currently 
						vice president and director of toxicology of Osborn Laboratories.</P>
					<P>Prior to joining Osborn, he was chief toxicologist and laboratory director for 
						the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, State of Oklahoma.</P>
					<P>His previous positions include toxicologist for the Office of the Chief Medical 
						Examiner, State of West Virginia, and Chief Toxicologist for the Kansas Bureau 
						of Investigations Forensics Sciences Laboratory.</P>
					<P>He has also held academic appointments at the University of Oklahoma and Rutgers 
						College.</P>
					<P>Dr. Rohrig holds a bachelor of science degree in chemistry, a doctorate with an 
						emphasis in pharmacology toxicology, and is certified by the American Board of 
						Forensic Toxicology.</P>
					<P>He is active in a number of professional society, including being past president 
						and current secretary of the Southwestern Association of Toxicologists and a 
						fellow of the toxicology section of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences.</P>
					<P>He has authored 15 peer reviewed articles and given numerous scientific 
						presentations in the field of toxicology.</P>
					<P>Dr. Rohrig will address confirmation methods in saliva testing.</P>
					<P>DR. ROHRIG: This afternoon I would like to spend some time sharing with you some 
						of our data on oral fluid or saliva or spit or something that comes out of the 
						mouth that we test for drugs.</P>
					<P>Since we don't have a lot of time, what I would like to do is focus in on 
						cocaine testing, and that is something that our laboratory and actually the 
						insurance industry has some experience with.
					</P>
					<P>Saliva testing has evolved from the necessity of the life and health insurance 
						industry to find a simple, cost effective way to assess risk in individuals.</P>
					<P>What this fancy statement basically means is that it is a new, cheap way to do 
						HIV testing. Since you could test for HIV they thought, what else could we test 
						for to help us in the risk assessment process in issuing life insurance 
						policies or health policies for individuals.</P>
					<P>When we talk about testing of oral fluid or saliva in the insurance industry, 
						basically we are talking about testing for HIV and it is actually HIV-I 
						antibodies, cotinine, a marker for cigarette usage.
					</P>
					<P>The laboratories will also do a validation specimen adequacy test to make sure 
						that we don't have a sample from Rover, or if we have a negative HIV, that it 
						is negative because the person is HIV negative and not that we don't have 
						enough sample.</P>
					<P>Then also as a tag along, cocaine testing is performed in the laboratory.</P>
					<P>Now, we have heard some talk earlier today about the predominant analyte in 
						cocaine. If you will recall just the previous slide, I had benzoylecgonine in 
						brackets as far as what we test for in an oral fluid sample or a saliva sample 
						in the insurance industry.</P>
					<P>This next slide will kind of explain or help explain why we look for 
						benzoylecgonine instead of parent cocaine.</P>
					<P>This is some data from Ed Cone's group. On the top we have cocaine itself, 
						tracking the concentration of cocaine with various dosings.</P>
					<P>You will see the concentration rise and fall, rise and fall.
					</P>
					<P>The time frame here is very short, on the order of hours.</P>
					<P>The question was asked earlier, is there a difference between devices or 
						stimulated or unstimulated. This data here from Dr. Cone shows that at least 
						with IV cocaine, there is a significant difference between saliva, stimulated 
						and unstimulated saliva.</P>
					<P>This is what I call the spit in the cup type collection, which is a little bit 
						different from what we use in the insurance industry.</P>
					<P>Dr. Peat shared with us the Epitope device, or the Episcreening device, the 
						stick, lollipop, with a pad on it. That is just one of many devices.</P>
					<P>Currently we support four or five oral fluid devices that either originate in 
						the United States or are sent in from international clients.</P>
					<P>SDS is one manufacturer that Dr. Niedbala mentioned. Right now we will get in 
						three different SDS devices.</P>
					<P>The buffer may be slightly different. One device may have an indicator. All this 
						indicator is, is a wick that goes up the device that says we have collected 
						enough spit and the end of it turns blue to say that we have collected an 
						estimated volume of oral fluid for testing.</P>
					<P>Back to the data, you will see cocaine rising and falling fairly rapidly. If we 
						look at benzoylecgonine in the dosing of cocaine, it actually rises.</P>
					<P>Now there is a significant concentration difference. Here we are like at 300 and 
						here that is like 2,000. So, there is almost an order of magnitude or at least 
						a five-fold difference in concentration, but still fairly high concentration of 
						benzoylecgonine that we are looking for.</P>
					<P>As far as the analytical procedures, these are common procedures that we use on 
						urine, that we can use in sweat, really any biological fluid. I use these on 
						brain tissue, for example, in our post mortem work.</P>
					<P>You can do a liquid liquid extraction or a solid phase extraction. Since we are 
						looking for benzoylecgonine, we have to derivatize.</P>
					<P>You can make a butyl derivative or a propyl derivative.
					</P>
					<P>Some people can make a TMS derivative. There are a variety of derivatives one 
						can make to get benzoylecgonine through the mass spectrometer for your 
						analyses.</P>
					<P>Good confirmation, we do use gas chromatography mass spectrometry. The State of 
						Kansas actually mandates that you use that as the confirmation technique.</P>
					<P>Recently they kind of revised it and said that you can use some sort of mass 
						spectrometry. So, they would allow MS/MS or LC/MS, but they want a mass 
						spectrometric method for the positive identification of the drug that you are 
						looking for, in this case, cocaine.</P>
					<P>Typical cocaine parameters, the people who are doing cocaine analysis probably 
						have something equal or similar to this as far as HP-1 type column or a DB-5 or 
						an RTX-50 or some semi-polar to non-polar type
					</P>
					<P>column.</P>
					<P>A typical ramp program, since we are -- this particular set up is for the 
						butylated derivatives. These are the ions that we look for and we monitor the 
						224 as our quant ion for BE using deuterated internal standard for the 
						analysis.</P>
					<P>As far as the identification of the analyte, again, traditional type rules that 
						we have put in place to identify the presence of benzoylecgonine, 2 percent 
						plus or minus retention time. That is compared to the calibrator.</P>
					<P>Plus or minus 20 percent of ion ratios, compared to the calibrator. Like 
						quantitation, one can do single point, you can do linear regression. We happen 
						to use single point.</P>
					<P>We normally report out either yea or nay. That is, benzoylecgonine or cocaine is 
						present or it is absent.</P>
					<P>As far as the calibrator, we use our calibrator at 10 nanograms per device. 
						Given Dr. Cone's comments, I will come back here in just a second and talk 
						about why we report per device.</P>
					<P>We have controls, eight nanograms and 12 nanograms on either side of the cut 
						off, if you will, as our internal QC samples.</P>
					<P>Now as I stated earlier, we support a variety of devices.
					</P>
					<P>Also, if you go back and remember, one of the very first slides I showed you is 
						what we do in the insurance industry.</P>
					<P>Toxicology is kind of the stepchild department in the risk assessment 
						laboratory. So, when an oral fluid sample comes in for testing, it is first 
						tested for HIV or IGG or whatever you use as your adequacy indicator.</P>
					<P>Then it is screened for cotinine and then it is screened for cocaine.</P>
					<P>If the HIV is reactive, and/or the cotinine is positive, they will either go 
						back and do another ELISA and if it is still reactive, they will go on to 
						western blot.</P>
					<P>If the cotinine is positive, some labs will go back and repeat the cotinine 
						assay on another aliquot of that buffer, if it is a collection device that 
						happens to have buffer on it.</P>
					<P>Then after all this testing is completed, then toxicology finally gets the 
						sample for the confirmation part of the assay.</P>
					<P>Even if we know that this particular device collects 1.5 mls of oral fluid, by 
						the time we get it, we don't have 1.5 mls of oral fluid left to test.</P>
					<P>We have opted to report out, this drug is present on a perdevice basis. What we 
						try to do to somewhat normalize it is, if we have an Epitope device come in, 
						our calibrator and controls will be made from Epitope devices.</P>
					<P>If we have an SDS third generation device come in, we will make our calibrator 
						and controls from the SDS third generation device. There is another device that 
						comes out of Canada that we get every now and then that is called a dry saliva 
						device that has no buffer. It is basically a wick with a pad on it and it goes 
						into an empty tube.</P>
					<P>If we get that sample in, we will make the appropriate calibrators and controls 
						from that material.</P>
					<P>Ten nanograms per device, that is our cut off. I have heard a lot of new terms 
						today as far as pharmacologically significant cut offs, scientifically 
						significant.</P>
					<P>Well, in the insurance industry a lot of this is what I call market driven cut 
						offs. Insurance boils down to dollars and cents. You have these actuaries or 
						bean counters that will determine that for a certain population there is so 
						much risk of mortality in this population.</P>
					<P>They have decided that a certain percentage of that population are cocaine users 
						and those are a bad risk. If you are a cocaine user, the chances of getting 
						life insurance and health insurance, if you are identified as one, is slim and 
						none at all.
					</P>
					<P>They get really upset if they switch from urine, which they have been testing 
						for drugs all along, and those cut offs being kind of set in stone either by 
						regulations by the state or the federal government, but they are kind of 
						comfortable with this 300 screening cut off and 350 nanogram cut off for VE for 
						cocaine confirmation.</P>
					<P>So, they say, all right, in the population that we have tested -- this is in 
						hundreds and thousands and millions of samples, a lot of pee goes through these 
						laboratories -- we expect about a .3 positive hit rate.</P>
					<P>If you go above or below that tremendously, they get a little anxious because 
						they are worried if they are throwing away good business, not taking policies 
						that they should, or accepting a lot of undue risk.</P>
					<P>So, the cut offs are somewhat driven by what cut off can we use that will mimic 
						or match what we are seeing with urine.</P>
					<P>That is, the industry wants a cocaine positive hit rate around .3 percent, to be 
						consistent with the urine sample.</P>
					<P>So, it is an arbitrary decision, but basically we meet the needs of the 
						industry. That is, we come up with a cut off that is close to what we expect to 
						yield a positive hit rate that is consistent with urine.</P>
					<P>Some data. That sounds like a very, very low cut off and it is a low cut off. 
						Can we still have good data on these devices at that low of a cut off.</P>
					<P>What I thought I would do is throw a couple of example chromatograms up here, 
						showing you some of the raw data that we actually achieve with this assay in 
						our hands, at least.</P>
					<P>This is our below cut off QC. This is an 8 nanogram per device QC sample for 
						benzoylecgonine. Composite total ion chromatogram here, the two ions from 
						benzoylecgonine deuterated internal standard, and then the three ions that we 
						use for quantitation and identification of benzoylecgonine in the sample.</P>
					<P>There is really a great signal to noise ratio, the chromatography is nice, 
						fairly short run times. So, we can get through a fair number of samples and 
						have good deductibility of these low levels of BE.</P>
					<P>At again the 10 nanogram cut off, we are running consistent.
					</P>
					<P>Actually we run a little bit higher hit rate in the oral fluid versus the urine, 
						but there are some other demographic factors that come into play that might 
						influence that.</P>
					<P>So, the bottom line is I tell the industry that yes, our oral fluid hit rate, 
						our saliva hit rate, is consistent with or equal to what we see in urine. That 
						makes the actuaries happy and the insurance is happy because they think they 
						are still making money.</P>
					<P>Here is another presentation of data. This is just a different software package, 
						so the presentation looks a little bit different.</P>
					<P>This is from a real live applicant sample, showing the internal standard ions 
						here, and again the quantitative and identifying, qualifying ions on the left 
						for BE.</P>
					<P>Let's see, this particular one comes out to about 40 nanograms per device.</P>
					<P>Linearity assay, the assay if fairly linear. This is data from an Epitope 
						device. We have these same linearity characteristics on the three SDS devices, 
						the dried saliva device.</P>
					<P>Dr. Niedbala had mentioned another newer device that is out on the market, but 
						we haven't started receiving those yet. I haven't had a chance to challenge 
						those as far as linearity.</P>
					<P>The bottom point on this -- obviously you can't see it, but we can go down to 
						about two nanograms per device and still have good signal to noise ratio. It 
						still falls on the curve.</P>
					<P>Now naturally this is a slide, so I picked the best one, but the R-square is one 
						in this particular one. We usually hit close to that, but you didn't expect me 
						to put anything less than that if I had it.</P>
					<P>The last piece of data that I will share with you is just a distribution. This 
						is percent of the positives. So, if we take 100 positives, what is the 
						distribution of concentration that we see.</P>
					<P>I am using concentration, again, loosely, but how much cocaine is left on the 
						device.</P>
					<P>If we talk about the ones that are greater than 50 nanograms per device, that 
						accounts for about 35 percent of the positives.
					</P>
					<P>Between 26 and 50 are about 27 percent, and when we go down to the 10 to 15 
						nanograms, about 22 percent of all the positives fall in that low range.</P>
					<P>We haven't had one, to the best of my knowledge, about 2,500. Most of them will 
						fall below 1,000 nanograms per device for BE.
					</P>
					<P>I think that is about the end of my time, so I will thank you and stop here.</P>
					<P>(Applause.)</P>
					<P>DR. HILDERBRAND: Now I would like to introduce Dr. Thomas Cairns, as vice 
						president for research and development for PsychoMedics Corporation in Culver 
						City, and adjunct professor of pharmaceutical sciences in the School of 
						Pharmacy, USC. That is the University of Southern California. He serves as an 
						FDA science advisor.</P>
					<P>Formerly a senior research scientist at FDA for 22 years, Dr. Cairns served as 
						the director of the National Center for Toxicological Research, a member of the 
						FDA senior science council, a national expert in organic mass spectrometry.</P>
					<P>His published research studies have involved the application of mass 
						spectrometry to ultratrace concentrations in the area of food and drug 
						research, in support of a regulatory program to provide consumer protection.</P>
					<P>Dr. Cairns received his PhD in analytical chemistry from the University of 
						Glasgow, Scotland. In 1990, the faculty of science of the University of Glasgow 
						in Scotland conferred upon him the degree of doctor of science, for work of 
						distinction in the field of mass spectrometry.</P>
					<P>Now we have actually a special treat for Dr. Cairns. He has just been notified 
						that he will be receiving the Hammer Award.</P>
					<P>This is the award that was established by Vice President Gore at a special 
						awards dinner at USC next Sunday.</P>
					<P>The award recognizes individuals who contribute significantly to the reinvention 
						process in government.</P>
					<P>Dr. Cairns was part of a four-member team who reinvented how FDA field labs 
						plan, execute and report research reports. I think that is a tremendous honor 
						for Dr. Cairns, and I think we ought to give him a hand.</P>
					<P>(Applause.)</P>
					<P>DR. CAIRNS: I understand that award is actually a hammer in a presentation case 
						with a note from the Vice President. So, it is pretty cheap, but it does bear 
						the intention of the program, which was to reinvent and make government a 
						little more efficient.</P>
					<P>Of course, I had to leave government to make that transition.</P>
					<P>What I am going to talk about today is really a three step process. I don't want 
						to confuse, but I want to educate that in mass spectrometry you are dealing 
						with three steps; identification, confirmation, and quantification.</P>
					<P>Now, as a little bit of preamble to this, I would like to take you through the 
						logic behind doing mass spectrometry of hair samples.</P>
					<P>By far, the highest level of confirmation is undoubtedly a total scan. Under 
						electron impact, you can in fact match full scan versus full scan.
					</P>
					<P>Traditionally, mass spectroscopers have said those ion ratios should be within 
						five percent, provided the standard and the unknown were recorded on the same 
						day on the same instrument within a reasonable amount of time.</P>
					<P>When it came to chemical ionization, the mass spectrometry community -- meaning 
						the Society for Mass Spectrometry -- realized that we were dealing with an ion 
						molecule reaction and that we had pressure fluctuations.</P>
					<P>So, they extended the window for ion ratio compliance to 20 percent.</P>
					<P>Now we come to the techniques commonly used in the 1980s and the 1990s; that is, 
						single or multiple ion monitoring, where traditionally you choose two or three 
						ions to identify the compound.
					</P>
					<P>That was established while I was at FDA in 1978, and that was done purely from a 
						data base that said okay, here is my molecular weight for my compound. How many 
						compounds have the same molecular weight. It turns out it was a whole slew of 
						compounds.</P>
					<P>If I give one fragment ion, it cuts it down to two compounds. If I give it two 
						ions it cuts it down to three and if I give the fourth ion I am down to one 
						unique compound, the compound of interest.</P>
					<P>There is no retention time or column, no relative abundance ratio, just purely 
						on the mass of the ions.</P>
					<P>Positive chemical ionization is a little more specific for analysis, since it 
						favors the molecular ion. I think the proteinated molecule ion is highly 
						significant of the compound you are dealing with.
					</P>
					<P>It is its molecular weight, after all. So, it gave you increased specificity.</P>
					<P>Then along came negative chemical ionization, which was a neat way of saying, 
						okay, if I incorporate fluorine into the molecule through some derivitization 
						procedure, I have greater sensitivity of detection because I have increased the 
						cross sectional area of the molecular for negative chemical ionization or the 
						molecule's ability to sustain a negative charge instead of a positive charge.</P>
					<P>The next logical sequence in confirmation technology was that introduction of 
						what we know as product ion chemistry, often referred to as daughter ion 
						chemistry.</P>
					<P>It is a simple process of using three mass spectrometers in tandem. The first 
						mass spectrometer is to select the ion required for interest, be it the 
						molecular weight of cocaine or benzoylecgonine, separate it from every other 
						ion in the spectrum and the source, take it through to the second mass 
						spectrometer where you collide with a gas such as argon, and cause a 
						fragmentation and then scan out the molecular weight of that daughter ion or 
						product ion in the third mass spectrometer.</P>
					<P>Hence the terminology, TSQ, tandem stage quadripole mass spectrometer. The first 
						one selects, the second one collides, the third one scans and detects.</P>
					<P>Now, apply these criteria to hair analysis and you look at it from a number of 
						important points. The first important point is the instrument performance 
						check.</P>
					<P>For hair analysis we make sure that we have a limit of detection below our cut 
						off, well below our cut off.</P>
					<P>We do limit of quantification and we do that in advance. We also use standards 
						and controls and also blanks.</P>
					<P>The standards are used in triplicate within each batch, so that we get a 
						response factor or it behaves as the calibrator.</P>
					<P>The criteria that we are going to use, retention time must be within plus or 
						minus two percent of the standards and controls run contemporaneously within a 
						batch of samples.</P>
					<P>The ion ratios, plus or minus 25 percent, particularly because we are dealing 
						with hair, we are dealing with a matrix, and we are dealing with a type of mass 
						spectrometry that is chemical ionization oriented and using a type of 
						instrumentation known as an ion trap.</P>
					<P>The number of ions, we try to stay within the traditional concepts of three 
						ions, but in certain cases with chemical ionization we have two very strong 
						ions, the specificity being we have one of them equal to the molecular ion or 
						the proteinated molecule ion.</P>
					<P>Our quantification is done by a technique as isotope dilution analysis, where we 
						use the retention time to separate the target analyte from its deuterated 
						analogue, usually by three or more scans or at least a little bit of time 
						between the two.</P>
					<P>Why is that? Just because a molecule contains deuterium, it does not have the 
						same retention time as the target analyte D-0. You know you have high 
						resolution on your capillary GC column, where you can clearly separate and 
						delineate D0, the target analyte, from its
					</P>
					<P>deuterated analogue, D3.</P>
					<P>On batch performance, we are going to do standards and controls. The standards 
						at the cut off are usually in triplicate, the controls one slightly below the 
						cut off, the other above the cut off, and insert the necessary blanks and 
						quality control samples.</P>
					<P>The first assay is PCP in hair. Traditionally that is done by electron 
						ionization, known as EIMS. We use an ion trap. We take total scans from mass 88 
						to 250.</P>
					<P>We use a standard curve approach to the analysis of PCP; that is, using a curve 
						that is calculated from two nanograms, five nanograms, 10 nanograms and 20 
						nanograms to 10 milligrams of hair.</P>
					<P>Now, what does the raw data look like? Here, as you can see, we have the three 
						ions belonging to D0 for PCP and the three ions belonging to the deuterated 
						analogue D5. This calculates out at about five nanograms per 10 milligrams of 
						hair. A cut off for this assay is three.</P>
					<P>Dealing with amphetamines and hair, we are looking for two target compounds, 
						meth amphetamine itself and amphetamine.</P>
					<P>Again, electron ionization is the choice for this assay.
					</P>
					<P>The scan is from mass 88 to 260 mass units. We derivatize to make both compounds 
						volatile for gas chromatography, and we use a mass spectrometer.</P>
					<P>Here is what the raw data looks like. Here you can see the meth amphetamine. In 
						this case we are dealing with a deuterated analogue that gives us a 254 versus 
						a 258. So, it is a D4 difference.
					</P>
					<P>The spiking for the deuterated analogue at this level is 10 nanograms and our 
						cut off is five. As I said, we calibrate at five using triplicate analysis, and 
						use that as a calibrator or a response factor.</P>
					<P>Linearity studies are conducted from way below the cut off at .5 up through two, 
						five, 10, 50 and 100 nanograms.</P>
					<P>As you can see, the spike is at 10, which is slightly above the five nanogram 
						cut off.</P>
					<P>Now, how good is this assay on a production level? We have heard a lot of 
						science, but what happens when you do this day in and day out.</P>
					<P>What I have got for you here is a typical month period running methamphetamine 
						standards and controls in a batch environment. As you can see, the five is run 
						in triplicate. So, you can see the variance in the five batch by batch as you 
						proceed along the month -- zero to 28 days. Here is the 10 control and here is 
						the two control.</P>
					<P>So, we have gone much the same route as urine perhaps testing, but we have gone 
						beyond it. We use the calibrator in triplicate and we are at much, much lower 
						levels.</P>
					<P>So, we have gone a little bit beyond, say, the standards required. We also run 
						blanks.</P>
					<P>This represents, I think, a good picture of reliability on 14 batches run over a 
						month's period.</P>
					<P>Opiates, we are looking for three compounds. What are the advantages, I think, 
						of hair? We are looking not only for codeine and morphine, but you are also 
						looking for the stable metabolite of heroin, 6-acetyl morphine, which is stable 
						in hair over long times relative to the very short half life that is 
						experienced in urine testing.</P>
					<P>Here again we derivatize. We are running scans from 275 to 440. Again, the same 
						scenario. We are calibrating three times five nanogram controls.</P>
					<P>The significance, I think, is that this compound clearly identifies a heroin 
						user and the poppy issue disappears.</P>
					<P>Here is what the spectra look like. You can see the ion abundance ratios are in 
						conformity. Here is D0 versus D3, and the amounts are significant here.</P>
					<P>This is codeine at the cut off of roughly five and you can clearly see signal to 
						noise. Here is morphine at roughly 24, and you can see the ratio of 6 acetyl 
						morphine is about 8.4 as derived from heroin. So, you can identify heroin users 
						directly.</P>
					<P>How good is this assay? Again, here is the triplicate calibrator at five 
						nanograms. Here is the 10 nanogram upper control and the two nanogram lower 
						control, again representing 14 batches run over a 28-day period. That is a 
						couple of hundred samples.</P>
					<P>Moving on to cocaine, here again what is the advantage of hair? You are getting 
						the parent drug, cocaine, the benzoylecgonine metabolite that is found in 
						urine, of course, but we are also getting another metabolite, cocoaethylene.</P>
					<P>The advantage of cocoaethylene is the synergism it adds to the cocaine use, 
						indicating that perhaps this individual is at least a frequent user of alcohol.</P>
					<P>How does this assay stack up? Here again I produced roughly one at the cut off 
						to show you good signal to noise, again three times five nanogram calibrator.</P>
					<P>The cocaine is at five nanograms. The ratio is D3 to D0 giving the amount. The 
						spike is at 10 nanograms.</P>
					<P>Here is benzoylecgonine at roughly 1.5 nanograms per 10 ml per 10 milligrams of 
						hair. Here is cocoaethylene at roughly one nanogram.</P>
					<P>Mass spectrometry wise, these are very, very significant and outstanding results 
						from the point of view that the on column injection that these represent are in 
						the low femtograms because of the volume of the extract prepared.</P>
					<P>When I look at the performance of this assay on a production level over a 
						typical month, here again is the triplicate at the cut off, five nanograms, the 
						high control, the low control. It is pretty impressive for production over a 
						long period of time.</P>
					<P>Perhaps the assay that demands the most accolades because it is modern 
						technology at use is, of course, the marijuana assay where we concentrate our 
						attention on carboxy THC.</P>
					<P>For obvious reasons, it is not found in smoke. The passive contamination issues 
						disappear. We have a problem going to low levels, and that is solved by tandem 
						mass spectrometry.</P>
					<P>The tandem mass spectrometry is done basically on this parent ion after 
						derivitization, incorporating the fluorine so that I can use negative chemical 
						ionization.</P>
					<P>Here is the structure of the 670 ion, which is the ion I am going to select to 
						collide with the argon and produce a daughter, or product, ion.</P>
					<P>This is the raw data. If you are not familiar with MS/MS, these are the ion 
						profiles for the deuterated internal standard, as well as the D0 for carboxy 
						THC.</P>
					<P>These represent individual data points over the envelope.
					</P>
					<P>If you are used to smooth curve, look at this curve. But look at the number of 
						data points acquired for collision.</P>
					<P>Each one of these apex points here is basically a collision experiment. So, we 
						get roughly 10 collisions over the elution profile, or the chromatographic 
						portion of elution.</P>
					<P>Here are the data points to show you how good the assay is on a production 
						level. I am talking about Psychemedics, doing roughly, basically -- since I 
						have been there two years I have accomplished more than 100,000 of these 
						analyses.</P>
					<P>That is spectacular in a production mode. When you consider here is the cut off, 
						there is the two and a half picogram, there is the five and there is the 10, 
						the technique is very suitable and reliable for precision and accuracy over the 
						long term of a month.</P>
					<P>You can tell that I do a lot more batches of carboxy THC than I do meth 
						amphetamine. So, it may give you a clue as to drug usage out in the real world.</P>
					<P>What were the challenges? The challenges were that for hair analysis, drug and 
						metabolite concentrations were much lower than those found in urine.</P>
					<P>Our cut offs, basically we get more positives by hair analysis, say, for cocaine 
						than urine. We are dealing with low nanograms per picograms injected on column. 
						That translates to femtograms.</P>
					<P>A digest procedure preserves the drugs, removes the components and our 
						extraction technique enriches and derivatizes for gas chromatography and, as 
						you can see, GC/MS confirmation at the femtogram level.</P>
					<P>In closing, I am pleased to say Psychomedics meets the challenge, that it has 
						innovative hair digestion technology with no loss of drug of interest or drugs 
						of interest, efficient extraction to separate the drugs from their matrix, 
						derivatization for GC/MS, and the successful use of ion trap technology to 
						concurrently identify drugs and metabolites using full scan data, and of course 
						tandem mass spectrometry.</P>
					<P>You all referred to GC/MS as the gold standard. Might I suggest that you refer 
						to GC/MS/MS as the platinum standard, since it is able to go to extremely low 
						levels for carboxy THC.</P>
					<P>I am reminded by Primo Levi that it is not the mere introduction of emerging 
						technologies that advance science. It is the creativity and innovative spirit 
						of the researchers. Thank you.
					</P>
					<P>(Applause.)</P>
					<P>DR. HILDERBRAND: It is always a pleasure to introduce the military members of 
						this group, primarily because of the impact that I have known of in the past 15 
						years.</P>
					<P>Dr. Smith is one of those premier members, so it is always a pleasure.</P>
					<P>Dr. Smith is currently a U.S. Army colonel and chief deputy medical examiner 
						over the forensic toxicology laboratories in the Office of the Armed Forces 
						Medical Examiner, Washington, D.C.</P>
					<P>He is a native of Buckland, Kansas. He received his bachelors degree in 
						chemistry from Kansas State Teachers College, Emporia, and a PhD in 
						bioanalytical chemistry from Purdue University.</P>
					<P>He has been awarded diplomate status by the American Board of Forensic 
						Toxicology. Past positions include being director of clinical research at army 
						medical centers and commander of the United States Army Forensic Toxicology 
						Drug Testing Laboratory, which served the European theater in the late 1980s.</P>
					<P>Dr. Smith has 120 professional publications and abstracts.
					</P>
					<P>The forensic toxicology laboratories he currently directs include the Department 
						of Defense, Central Post Mortem Human Performance Laboratory, the DOD Drug 
						Testing Quality Control Laboratory, and the DOD Forensic Toxicology Research 
						Branch.</P>
					<P>His current research interests are in the development of analytical methods for 
						drug analysis. Dr. Smith will speak on confirmation methods in urine testing. 
						Dr. Smith.</P>
					<P>DR. SMITH: Thank you, Rich. My presentation, as you can see, is going to be on 
						confirmation of drugs in urine.</P>
					<P>I would like to thank DTAB, first of all, for inviting me.
					</P>
					<P>I see Ed left, but I would like to thank him for turning his back long enough 
						that I stole this slide out of his collection.</P>
					<P>Actually, in less than 15 minutes, I am going to outline general testing 
						principles for confirmation of drugs in urine, selection of target molecules, 
						and then go into extraction and GC mass spec requirements.</P>
					<P>I am also going to talk a little bit about a few analytical problems and 
						interpretation problems that have arisen in the past decade of urine testing.</P>
					<P>In general, confirmation procedure requires a qualitative drug identification. 
						Then once that is done, we have to demonstrate that the drug quantitation is at 
						or above an administrative cut off. I call them an administrative cut off.</P>
					<P>Also, I put up here at this particular point, as a reminder, that you also have 
						to be able to interpret the results.</P>
					<P>I think a good example of these principles, or general principles of 
						confirmation testing I can select from the military.</P>
					<P>In the Department of Defense, it is illegal to use drugs.
					</P>
					<P>It is not just against some regulation. People get prosecuted and they go to 
						jail.</P>
					<P>If we consider the example of a soldier who is being accused of using drugs and 
						prosecuted, based solely on the policy of urinalysis result, an expert witness 
						who comes into court to defend the laboratory's data has to first of all prove 
						-- let's say this guy is being accused of using marijuana or hashish -- has to 
						prove that there is 11 nor delta 9 tetrahydrocannabinol 9 carboxylic acid in 
						his urine.
					</P>
					<P>After that particular proof, the expert witness is also challenged to show that 
						the quantitation is equal to 15 nanograms per milliliter or above.</P>
					<P>The proof does not stop at this particular point, because the person is not 
						charged with having this particular substance in their urine. They are being 
						charged with using the drug.</P>
					<P>So, based on known literature data, the expert witness also has to tell the 
						finders or fact, or convince them, that measurement and identification of this 
						particular metabolite can be tied back to the ingestion of marijuana or 
						hashish.</P>
					<P>In the work place programs, both SAMHSA and DOD test for the five drugs shown up 
						here, which include the classes amphetamines, cannabinoids, cocaine, opiates 
						and PCP.</P>
					<P>In addition, the Department of Defense also looks for barbiturates, LSD and 
						steroids and selected designer drugs.</P>
					<P>Currently the designer drugs that are authorized are MDA, MDMA and MDEA. I 
						should also mention that some other regulated agencies, such as those that are 
						controlled by the NRC, have approval to test for other drugs.</P>
					<P>One of the first problems to solve in the confirmation process is to identify 
						target molecules. For the drug selected, the metabolism must be known so that 
						we can pick an effective testing method and also we can interpret the results.</P>
					<P>Usually long detection times and analytical feasibility are also desirable.</P>
					<P>The choice of a particular target metabolite can be as simple as, in this 
						particular case, for PCP where PCP itself, the parent drugs is one of the 
						principal, long-lasting metabolites.</P>
					<P>It can be a little bit more complex, such as in this case with heroin, which is 
						shown in the lower right-hand corner, which metabolizes to 6 acetyl morphine, 
						then to morphine, and then finally to the conjugated metabolites of morphine.</P>
					<P>Any one of these particular metabolites could be selected for a drug testing 
						program, but there are many factors that could be considered.</P>
					<P>This is one of them. What is shown up here in blue is actually a representation 
						of the conjugated morphine in a particular sample from an individual who was 
						given a known dose of heroin.</P>
					<P>The smaller amount of free morphine is also shown in red. Down at the bottom you 
						can see that little bit of 6 acetyl morphine.
					</P>
					<P>It might be a good idea to use 6 acetyl morphine, since it is much more 
						specific, but it is very low in concentration.</P>
					<P>This is why one of the general approaches in testing for heroin use is to first 
						screen for the total amount of morphine in the sample, set an administrative 
						cut off.</P>
					<P>Then all those samples that are above that particular level are re-investigated 
						with more refined technology to look for 6 acetyl morphine, the specific 
						metabolite.</P>
					<P>These are the current metabolites or target molecules and cut offs. I won't go 
						through them. You can read them later in the handout.</P>
					<P>I will point out that the cut offs for codeine and morphine for SAMHSA I believe 
						are going to change on the first of July to 2000 nanograms per milliliter. Is 
						that not true, Donna?</P>
					<P>DR. BUSH: We have not adopted that policy yet, so there is no way for me to 
						comment.</P>
					<P>DR. SMITH: Never mind. I just thought I saw that in the bulletin.</P>
					<P>At some point in the future, they are considering raising them to 2000 nanograms 
						per milligram. (Laughter.)</P>
					<P>I might also point out for general interest, you can see how much lower the LSD 
						cut off is and why it is such an analytical challenge.</P>
					<P>At this particular point, we are going to talk about the analytical process. As 
						this cartoon says, the husband says to his wife, you know, do you want me to 
						guess what is in it? What am I, a toxicologist? That is what we are here for.</P>
					<P>The first step in the confirmation procedure is actually extraction. We forget 
						to talk about that because GC mass specs are kind of sexy and more interesting.</P>
					<P>But extracting the target analyte out of the urine matrix and getting rid of all 
						that junk is a very important part of the process.</P>
					<P>This can be done by either a solid phase extraction or a liquid liquid. 
						Actually, both of these are used and, when optimized, get rid of most of the 
						interfering substances.</P>
					<P>Also, GC mass spec analysis usually follows this, once we have got the target 
						analyte into some kind of reconstituted fluid, and electron impact selected ion 
						monitoring is a very popular type of GC mass spec that is used, also ion trap.</P>
					<P>There are also tandem mass spectrometry techniques that are used. A case in 
						point might be LSD. At least two of the laboratories do LSD in the Department 
						of Defense system using a TSQ.</P>
					<P>I am not going to focus on those because the most common technique is actually 
						electron impact, SIMS. So, when we go into the actual requirements for these 
						confirmation techniques, I will principally focus on just the GC mass spec EI 
						SIM.</P>
					<P>As I said, I can start with the solid phase extraction. I won't go through this. 
						This is a teaching slide. I am just using it here to show that this is a first 
						step.</P>
					<P>You end up getting a chromatogram. I thought at this point I should probably 
						show a chromatogram, since that is what we are talking about.</P>
					<P>As you can see, there are some impurities in the solid phase extraction, this 
						particular one for PCP. But they are well separated from the analyte of 
						interest.</P>
					<P>I am going to go through just the GC mass spec criteria.
					</P>
					<P>You have seen many of these before from the other presentations, but a lot of 
						these were developed for urine testing.</P>
					<P>Certified capillary columns essentially means that once you get a capillary 
						column, which is the most common type of column used in urine drug testing, you 
						have to condition the column and then you have to put some kind of check 
						samples through it, to show that you get good analytical separation.</P>
					<P>The GC mass spec procedure itself has to be tested with known samples and 
						controls, to demonstrate that you can get expected values. Some of the actual 
						requirements for that you will see later.
					</P>
					<P>You must determine an LOD, and LOQ, and to test the linearity not only for your 
						instrument, even though this is an instrumental check, but for the procedure 
						itself.</P>
					<P>We often forget that the operators have to be certified and in most laboratories 
						that is done. Records are kept of their certification and continuous education 
						is provided for most of those people also.</P>
					<P>A very important component of the laboratories which has developed over the past 
						decade is the reviewers certifying scientists saying, this result is good to 
						go.</P>
					<P>At this point I should probably point out that most of these techniques are good 
						laboratory practice. Many of them are actually requirements within the SAMHSA 
						system and within DOD. Some that aren't I will try to point out as I go along, 
						if I happen to remember that.</P>
					<P>A daily autotune is required in most of the laboratories and also that you have 
						frequent septum and insert changes. In the Department of Defense it is required 
						to be daily.</P>
					<P>If we go on to the analytical quality control requirements, we have to use an 
						extracted standard in the testing process, which means it cannot be a 
						non-extracted standard in some kind of a solvent.</P>
					<P>In general, deuterated internal standards are used. There are some exceptions. 
						One I will mention again is LSD. We have not found an acceptable deuterated 
						standard for LSD. We still use a congener, lampa, in that particular assay.</P>
					<P>The standards and controls themselves, once they are prepared or purchased must 
						be certified to have the right target concentration and to meet other 
						parameters.</P>
					<P>There are open and blind quality controls in the confirmation process. This is 
						one difference I will point out.</P>
					<P>I don't think SAMHSA or the NLCP program currently requires blind controls in 
						the confirmation process, even though some laboratories do carry their blinds 
						through to confirmation.</P>
					<P>The Department of Defense right now requires both a positive and a negative 
						blind control.</P>
					<P>Some of the controls that are nice to have in the process are a drug free 
						control, a cut off control, something that is 40 percent of the cut off, and at 
						125 percent of the cut off.</P>
					<P>Controls like this are similarly required by both the NLCP and the Department of 
						Defense.</P>
					<P>Also, the basic chromatography, that thing we learned a long time ago, has some 
						requirements. There are certain peak height and area requirements.</P>
					<P>I haven't put any specific things up here because it depends on the instrument, 
						the laboratory and the procedure.</P>
					<P>But nearly every laboratory has some minimum requirement, which includes minimum 
						abundances signal and noise criteria, symmetrical peak shape.</P>
					<P>Now the last two things listed up here are specific objective requirements. In 
						most cases the retention time has to be plus or minus two percent of the 
						extracted standard.</P>
					<P>In the Department of Defense we have a resolution requirement that is listed 
						here at the bottom, which essentially says that the resolution of the peak of 
						interest, whether it is the principal ion or any of the associated ions, has to 
						be separated from other things with a resolution greater than one. If there 
						happens to be a shoulder on the peak, the shoulder has to be less than 10 
						percent of the peak height.</P>
					<P>GC/MS criteria are listed up here: three drug ions, two internal standard ions, 
						ion ratios must be plus or minus 20 percent of the standard.</P>
					<P>This is what an ion chromatogram looks like, three typical ions for PCP.</P>
					<P>These are some of the analytical problems that I mentioned before. Some of those 
						people who have been in the program a long time will know that some common 
						interferences with amphetamines are sympathomimetic amines. This was a problem 
						in the system.</P>
					<P>SAMHSA addressed this problem principally by making the laboratories prove that 
						they could separate things like ephedrine, pseudo ephedrine, et cetera, from 
						the target compounds, methamphetamine and amphetamine.</P>
					<P>There was a heroin and poppy seed problem that arose. This was solved by medical 
						review officer requirements.</P>
					<P>The last two up here are specific for DOD. Essentially the one for cocaine was 
						that benzoylecgonine was said to not be a good enough metabolite. It was later 
						shown that it was acceptable in most courts of law.</P>
					<P>This is a specific problem, just a total ion chromatogram.
					</P>
					<P>I should point out that the PPA there should be ephedrine.</P>
					<P>You can see some extra peaks in this methamphetamine ion chromatogram tracing, 
						but well separated from the methamphetamine which is on the left.</P>
					<P>Not so for the particular ion selected for amphetamine.
					</P>
					<P>Even in the total ion chromatogram where there didn't appear to be 
						interferences, there was some.</P>
					<P>This is s typical problem for DOD. This particular screened positive. Sixty 
						percent of the samples then confirmed negative.</P>
					<P>One of the reasons is a contaminant, isol LSD. That is something that needs to 
						be addressed in the Department of Defense.</P>
					<P>I put this anecdote up here because it essentially shows that we have to know 
						something about the science of the molecules in order to establish good 
						policies.</P>
					<P>This is my summary. We need, for GC mass spec confirmation, an optimized 
						extraction, defined chromatography criteria, acceptable MS criteria, adequate 
						quality control, and we need to interpret. We need to have criteria to do that.</P>
					<P>Once we have done all these things, we are ready to fly.
					</P>
					<P>Thank you.</P>
					<P>(Applause.)</P>
					<P>DR. HILDERBRAND: Now an opportunity to re-introduce Dr.
					</P>
					<P>Armbruster. I won't go through the entire bio that he has provided. What we will 
						hope is that he in the last hour is still the designated RP at PharmChem, and 
						leads their forensic drug testing for the National Laboratory Certification, 
						certified laboratory.</P>
					<P>He is the laboratory scientific director and I welcome Dr. Armbruster.</P>
					<P>DR. ARMBRUSTER: Thanks. I was kind of hoping to waive all that fluff in the bio 
						and take that time and add it to the presentation.
					</P>
					<P>I feel kind of pressure to go into verbal after burn to tell you everything that 
						I want to tell you.</P>
					<P>DR. HILDERBRAND: One minute.</P>
					<P>DR. ARMBRUSTER: It can't hurt to ask. I feel a little bit guilty. One thing I 
						didn't talk to you about in the first presentation was our elution procedure.</P>
					<P>Yes, we get this sweat patch and we don't have liquid here.
					</P>
					<P>We have to elute the drug from that patch. What we do is take about two mls of a 
						methanol acetate buffer and we have a half an hour elution procedure. We wind 
						up with maybe 1.5 mls of actual eluate and that is what we actually test.</P>
					<P>Going back to Dr. Cone's point, when you determine a cut off in terms of 
						concentration, how should you standardize or establish that. Well, we use it in 
						terms of nanograms per ml, because we do
					</P>
					<P>have a certain quantity of liquid that we deal with.</P>
					<P>That is also a problem, because if you have a multiple positive, you can run out 
						of sample before you can confirm everything that you would like to confirm.</P>
					<P>I should mention that we have stuck with the sacred NIDA five. It seems like a 
						practical thing to do. We can look at other drugs, and with the other sources 
						of specimens you could look at other drugs as well, but for practical purposes, 
						we stick with the NIDA, now SAMHSA, five.</P>
					<P>I have explained about the cut offs, where we got them from.
					</P>
					<P>What I again wanted to emphasize is that data that I showed you before, that 
						clinical data, all those specimens were analyzed by GC/MS as well as the 
						immunoassays.</P>
					<P>So, we do have known, quantitative -- for our system -- nanogram per ml values 
						for all of that data.</P>
					<P>Finally, of course, as you recall from the discussion of the immunoassays, we 
						know that we are going to get false positives. That is just something that goes 
						along with choosing the optimal cut off.</P>
					<P>The false positives are still the bete noir, the hobgoblin of forensic 
						toxicology. Our ace in the hole is that we do have confirmatory procedures and 
						we can use them to knock out those false positives.</P>
					<P>This is our amphetamine GC/MS assay for the sweat patch.
					</P>
					<P>Two analytes here are amphetamine and methamphetamine, same as in urine. We use 
						internal standards, deuterated internal standards, just as with the urinalysis 
						for GC/MS.</P>
					<P>I am expecting a collective gasp because this is the notorious CB derivative. 
						You remember this bad boy from a few years ago, the false positive 
						methamphetamine in urine samples. That is proven and it is a concern, and I 
						will get to how we address that concern in just a second here.</P>
					<P>We use a 58/90 59/70, a standard GC/MS system here, electron ionization, DB1 
						column, again three ions for both drugs, two drugs for each one of the 
						deuterated internal standards, the standard approach for confirmatory testing.</P>
					<P>The cut off for GC/MS is the same as for our immunoassay, 10 nanograms per ml, 
						and again, you saw that data, the clinical data, the ROC curve.</P>
					<P>We can go down to two nanograms per ml for an LOD LOQ,
					</P>
					<P>decent linearity for what we are dealing with here. Of course, recognize, in 
						comparison to urine, it is a 500 nanogram per ml cut off.
					</P>
					<P>So, we are quite a bit below that, and keep that in mind when I show you the 
						chromatograms.</P>
					<P>The control scheme and calibrator scheme follows what we use at PharmChem for 
						urine testing. So, we have a zero, we have a low control, we have basically a 
						cut off control.</P>
					<P>We throw in a 20 control, twice cut off, just for the heck of it in this assay. 
						Then we have what we call a carry over control.</P>
					<P>We will follow this carry over control with a negative. We look to make sure 
						that negative is below LOD. Otherwise, we may have a carry over problem.</P>
					<P>Okay, so we are using this CB derivative. We know that ephedrine and 
						pseudoephedrine and compounds like that in large concentrations in urine can 
						cause a false positive, because in the injection port under the right 
						conditions -- and there are a lot of discussions about what the right 
						conditions are, phases of the moon, et cetera -- you can create 
						methamphetamine, it seems.</P>
					<P>We tested ephedrine and pseudoephedrine at 5000 nanograms per ml, and yes, I 
						know you are going to say but a milligram per ml is what we use in urine for 
						interference, but our cut off is a lot lower, too. We feel that this is not 
						unreasonable in terms of challenging the system with the amphetamine-like drugs 
						that could cause a problem.
					</P>
					<P>Another thing that seems to be common when you have the false methamphetamine 
						positives is a high injection port temperature.</P>
					<P>We run at a relatively cool 200 degrees centigrade. We don't think that we are 
						creating a problem for ourselves.</P>
					<P>To date we have had no amphetamines -- that is either amphetamine or 
						methamphetamine -- to test greater than 1000. So, we are dealing with fairly 
						small concentrations of the amphetamine compounds here.</P>
					<P>This is a typical chromatogram for amphetamine at 10 nanograms per ml, at our 
						cut off. I think you would agree this looks pretty decent, what you would 
						expect for a urine specimen, but with a cut off of 500 nanograms per ml. So, we 
						are kind of proud of that.
					</P>
					<P>Here we see the typical split methamphetamine peak, and here is the 
						methamphetamine, again at our cut off of 10 nanograms per ml. I think this 
						looks acceptable and much like what you would expect with urine testing.</P>
					<P>Here we have the cocaine sweat patch assay. Here is where we split company 
						somewhat with the urine testing.</P>
					<P>We look for cocaine. We look for BZE, benzoylecgonine, and EME or ecgonine 
						methyl ester, all three of them.</P>
					<P>Of course, under the SAMHSA program this is verboten and this is verboten. You 
						can only look at benzoylecgonine. This is the blessed drug, the metabolite that 
						you can actually acquire data for, as SAMHSA likes to say.</P>
					<P>We look for all three because we can find all three. Again, cocaine is really 
						the predominant form of the drug that we find in sweat, however.</P>
					<P>Internal standards for all three, typical trideuterate internal standards. We 
						use a derivative for the benzoylecgonine and the ecgonine methyl ester. The 
						cocaine comes through underivatized.</P>
					<P>We do use solid phase extraction. If I don't mention solid phase extraction it 
						is because we use liquid liquid.</P>
					<P>Here we have a 58/90 59/71. The 59/71 is not unusual in laboratories doing 
						confirmation for urinalysis testing, too.</P>
					<P>A typical EI in the DB1 column, we look at the typical EI SIM approach, three 
						different ions for each one of the analytes and two ions for each one of the 
						internal standards.</P>
					<P>Our cut off remains, as for the immunoassay, at 10 nanograms per ml. We have 
						established LOD LOQ for each one of the analytes.</P>
					<P>I should mentioned these are not statistical. We kind of favor an empirical 
						approach, which I personally think is good, rather than just multiplying a 
						number to come up with a statistical kind of LOD LOQ.</P>
					<P>Decent linearity, again when you consider our cut off is 10 nanograms per ml. 
						Again, we use a zero, a low cut off, a cut off and a carry over control.</P>
					<P>Here we have cocaine, which is the longest retention time. Again, I think it 
						looks halfway decent, acceptable, followed by BZE, benzoylecgonine, the shorter 
						retention time, right here. Again, this looks like decent chromatography, 
						acceptable results. Finally, the ecgonine methyl ester, the shortest retention 
						time. I don't think many people would have a problem accepting that kind of 
						data.</P>
					<P>On to opiates. Opiates gets even more interesting. Now we have four analytes. We 
						can detect all four of these. We now can detect heroin, the parent compound, 
						better than even 6-MAM. We have the mother of the drug right there, plus 
						morphine and codeine.</P>
					<P>So, following the standard protocol, however, for urine testing, we have a 
						separate internal standard for each one, trideuterated.</P>
					<P>We do a derivative. We use a 58/90, 59/72 and the 59/72s are not all that 
						unusual either these days either in urine testing laboratories.</P>
					<P>EI SIM, three analytes again for each one of these four.
					</P>
					<P>Two ions for each one of the internal standards.</P>
					<P>The cut off for the GC/MS assay is at 10 nanograms per ml as for the 
						immunoassay. Yes, LOD LOQs for all four analytes. Linearity 5 to 500, again 
						decent when you consider our cut off. Controls, the same standard pattern that 
						you have seen for the other analytes.</P>
					<P>Here we have heroin out here, the longest retention time.
					</P>
					<P>This maybe doesn't look quite as pretty as what we have seen before, but it is 
						usable. It is workable data.</P>
					<P>Going on down, we have our 6-MAM. Again, maybe not the prettiest, but certainly 
						acceptable. Cut off for morphine, next in line here, I think that is all right 
						as well.</P>
					<P>Finally, codeine, again, at the cut off of 10 nanograms per ml, not textbook 
						perfect here, but again, it is acceptable data, when you consider again that a 
						urine cut off for GC/MS is up at 300 nanograms per ml.</P>
					<P>I have to apologize. I don't think you will find this slide in your handout. I 
						don't know if that is a faux pas on the part of us at PharmChem or if something 
						was lost in translation further down the line, but in my copy at least I don't 
						have this, but it is not that big of a deal.</P>
					<P>This is PCP. The analyte is PCP, as with urine. Of course, we use this typical 
						internal standard. No derivitization. We are back to a 58/90 59/71 system, EI 
						SIM, three ions, two ions for the internal standard.</P>
					<P>We use a 10 nanogram per ml calibrator cut off. The cut off, however, is at 7.5. 
						So, maybe we fudge a little bit there. We don't feel like making up a 7.5 cut 
						off calibrator.</P>
					<P>This is, of course, the same cut off that we use for the immunoassay, LOD LOQ 
						down at one, linearity one to five, same standard control.</P>
					<P>This is our cut off at 10 nanograms per ml, looking pretty good here for PCP. Of 
						course, this isn't that dramatic a change, when you consider it is a 25 
						nanogram per ml specimen for urine specimen.
					</P>
					<P>Now just for chuckles and grins, I thought I would take you down to the one 
						nanogram per ml LOD here. Not bad, it is getting a little bit fuzzy there, and 
						not super. We are pressing the envelope, but we can still get usable data down 
						at our LOD LOQ for PCP.</P>
					<P>I have saved the best for last, which is THC. Here is where we do kind of break 
						company with the traditional approach in urine testing.</P>
					<P>The analyte is THC, not the carboxylic acid metabolite, but the parent drug. We 
						do use the parent drug trideuterated for internal standards.</P>
					<P>We derivatize it. We have solid phase extraction. We use 58/90 but now a 59/89 
						MS engine, not typical for urine labs.</P>
					<P>We use negative chemical ionization. Why do we use NCI? Well, the big advantage 
						of NCI is that it allows you to increase your sensitivity.</P>
					<P>Estimates are 10 to 100 times increased in sensitivity. I don't really want to 
						say sensitivity. I want to say lower your limit of detection. I hate using 
						those synonymously.</P>
					<P>Anyway, we have to go down pretty far here. So, we couldn't get by with the 
						typical system. We had to go to the engine. We had to go to NCI in order to get 
						the limit of detection that we needed.</P>
					<P>Our cut off now is not five nanograms per ml as we had with the immunoassay, but 
						.5 nanograms per ml or 500 picograms per ml.</P>
					<P>Here again is a little differences. All right, it is a big difference maybe. We 
						use only a single ion for both the analyte and for the internal standard.</P>
					<P>Then again, remember, chemical ionization is a kinder, gentler way of getting 
						ions as opposed to EI. So, we don't typically see as many ions either.</P>
					<P>So, we are running with just a single ion for both analyte and internal 
						standard. Our LOD LOQ us down there at .02 nanograms per ml at 20 picograms per 
						ml, pretty low.</P>
					<P>Our upper linearity is 15 nanograms per ml, which is the cut off for the urine 
						testing system. Our control is zero down there, well below the cut off, right 
						at the cut off, and about 10 times, twice the cut off there, and a carry over 
						control as well.</P>
					<P>What does it look like? Like this. At cut off, .5 nanograms per ml or 500 
						picograms per ml, that is what we can see with the engines and the negative 
						chemical ionization.</P>
					<P>So, it is not too terribly bad, and yes, it is only a single peak for the 
						analyte, only a single peak for the internal standards.
					</P>
					<P>Again, for chuckles and grins, I thought I would show you what it looks like 
						when we go down to that 20 picogram per ml limit of detection, limit of 
						quantitation.</P>
					<P>Internal standard is doing just fine. This is not the prettiest chromatogram 
						that you would like to see, but you certainly get separation from baseline with 
						the peak there.</P>
					<P>So, again, we are pressing the performance envelope of the assay. I have two 
						minutes left and I think that is my last slide, so I actually beat the limit. 
						Thanks very much.</P>
					<P>(Applause.)</P>
					<P>DR. HILDERBRAND: There was a comment made earlier that the result of not having 
						a long and illustrious career was having a short bio.</P>
					<P>There can be an alternative explanation and that is that a person is a little 
						more modest in what they present to be introduced with. I am certain that is 
						the case here with Dr. Sal Salamone.</P>
					<P>I have a short bio but I don't think that this represents everything that he has 
						accomplished.</P>
					<P>He has a bachelors degree in chemistry and biology from Villanova, MS and PhD in 
						chemistry from Rutgers, post-doctoral fellow in bioorganic chemistry from 
						Oxford University.</P>
					<P>He has over 90 scientific publications and abstracts and is an adjunct professor 
						at Fordham University, New Jersey University of Dentistry and Medicine and the 
						New Jersey Institute of Technology.</P>
					<P>He has 14 years in research and development at Roche Diagnostic Systems and is 
						currently responsible for the United States R&amp;D and manufacturing support 
						operations for Roche Diagnostic Systems.
					</P>
					<P>This responsibility includes centralized and decentralized testing for both 
						therapeutic drugs and drugs of abuse.
					</P>
					<P>Dr. Salamone will speak on the confirmation and on-site testing.</P>
					<P>DR. SALAMONE: I don't have a great deal to say about confirmation testing, since 
						the testing is urine based testing, and the antibodies that we are using are 
						the same antibodies, or they have similar characteristics to antibodies that 
						you use in the instrument based test.</P>
					<P>In addition, the cut off values, if you look at all these on site tests, the cut 
						off values are identical in most cases.</P>
					<P>So, what we are recommending is that you take presumptive positives and then you 
						follow the proper chain of custody as you would in HHS testing, send it to an 
						HHS lab and perform GC/MS confirmation according to HHS procedures.</P>
					<P>On my first slide I just -- it is as simple as that. The thing that becomes more 
						critical with these on-site tests is the proficiency testing.</P>
					<P>There are a couple of critical characteristics of on-site testing that are 
						different than laboratory based testing.</P>
					<P>One is, in laboratory based testing, you use a small sample size and you dilute 
						it in the reagents. Perhaps only five or 10 percent of the total reaction 
						mixture is urine.</P>
					<P>Well, with most on-site tests, you are using the urine neat.
					</P>
					<P>What you are doing, you have lyophilized reagents or reagents in some sample 
						pad.</P>
					<P>What you are doing is you are putting in the urine and the urine is the reaction 
						medium in which the reaction takes place.</P>
					<P>So, these types of tests are more prone to matrices. So, when one is setting up 
						a proficiency testing program for urine based onsite tests, you really have to 
						evaluate these tests in terms of how they react with different urine matrices. 
						That is a very important aspect.
					</P>
					<P>Another important aspect is the cut off of these assays.
					</P>
					<P>When you are performing an instrument based test, what you have is every day you 
						can run a calibrator and base the assays on that calibrator.
					</P>
					<P>Well, these on-site tests are fixed cut offs. They don't vary or you cannot put 
						in a new calibrator and recalibrate the test.</P>
					<P>What Dr. Caplan was saying earlier, the test valid and test complete doesn't 
						really indicate the performance of the test, but it indicates that the reagents 
						are working properly.</P>
					<P>I have been at this game long enough, and I have evaluated enough on-site tests 
						to tell you that FDA approval or FDA certification doesn't mean that the test 
						is going to perform according to package insert criteria.</P>
					<P>Any proficiency program that you put together really has to have samples that 
						challenge the cut off, not necessarily challenge the cut off plus or minus 25 
						percent of the cut off, but challenge it in some way that you can feel good 
						that the cut off that the package insert states is indeed the cut off. That is 
						about all that I had to say.
					</P>
					<P>(Applause.)</P>
					<P>DR. HILDERBRAND: This is good. We actually had a fair amount of time for 
						questions anyway. The next session starts tomorrow morning at 8:15, but this 
						gives a few additional minutes.</P>
					<P>If there are questions from the Drug Testing Advisory Board, I am sure the panel 
						members would be pleased to take those.</P>
					<P>DR. KWONG: I have two quick questions. The first one is for Dr. Armbruster. In 
						your amphetamine assay, the 5000 nanograms per ml of ephedrine and 
						pseudoephedrine, is that what you would expect in sweat for someone who abuses 
						amphetamine or has taken a high dose of ephedrine.</P>
					<P>DR. ARMBRUSTER: That is why I qualified, at the very bottom of the slide, we 
						haven't seen any amphetamines above 1000 nanograms per ml.</P>
					<P>That is a good question. We are still in the infancy of sweat testing. I can't 
						honestly say that we have the data to show that if a person was taking a 
						certain dosage of ephedrine, pseudoephedrine or some other amphetamine 
						compound, over the counter type preparation, what we would really expect to 
						see. That is, at this time, I guess our best guesstimate.</P>
					<P>The second question I have is for Dr. Rohrig. I am still nagged by this concept 
						of nanogram per device. The question I have is, just like Dr. Armbruster saying 
						that the sample having to be eluted from the patch, in saliva you have to 
						collect it in a pad as a liquid or it is in a pad and you have to elute it.</P>
					<P>Don't you have an aliquoting staff where you can quantitatively aliquot saliva 
						so that your results can be in a nanograms per ml?</P>
					<P>DR. ROHRIG: Yes. Most of the devices that are in use today have buffer in the 
						pad. In the normal process for the initial screening, you will centrifuge the 
						whole device and theoretically force the liquid out of the pad, and you can 
						aliquot that buffer.</P>
					<P>The problem is that you are having several assumptions, that the pads collect an 
						equivalent volume of oral fluid.</P>
					<P>That is one of the problems, for instance, with the Epitope OraSure device. The 
						requirement is to keep it in the mouth for two minutes.</P>
					<P>Two minutes, to some people collecting it, is an inordinate long period of time 
						and other times two minutes is very quickly.</P>
					<P>I could say, well, there are so many nanograms per ml of buffer. To me that is 
						just as useful information as saying there are so many nanograms per whole 
						device.</P>
					<P>The purpose that we are utilizing, at least in our industry, is to identify a 
						cocaine user. We are not making any predictions such as impairments or that 
						sort of TDM type of work.</P>
					<P>You could call it per ml but then you would have the same discussion as you 
						would with the sweat patch, where you are eluting it off.</P>
					<P>I just felt that saying nanograms per total device, test kit, more accurately 
						reflects what we found analytically, instead of just making an arbitrary 
						determination of so many nanograms per ml of buffer.</P>
					<P>DR. KWONG: If you were to use saliva in work place drug testing, would you feel 
						comfortable using that concept, nanograms per device?</P>
					<P>DR. ROHRIG: It depends on how it is collected. If you are using it in work place 
						testing and you have a protocol as far as a stimulated sample and you spit in a 
						cup, if you will, then yes, you could get by with that.</P>
					<P>Again, coming from our industry, there is other testing going on. We are not 
						doing drug testing in a vacuum. We have to adjust what we are doing to fit the 
						needs of the industry, and accurately reflect what we are doing so that the 
						data is not misused.</P>
					<P>DR. JONES: One quick question, especially to the hair and sweat and saliva 
						device testing. Are there compounds, or are there analytes that we should be 
						aware of, that you are aware of, that should be included in proficiency testing 
						programs as challenges to analytical procedures that are unique to either of 
						the three of you?</P>
					<P>It follows up from Tai's question a little bit, but in the urine testing program 
						we see the sympathomymedica means put into the PT program.</P>
					<P>I know we may be getting into this a little bit tomorrow also, but is there 
						anything that you have identified in your experiences that we should be aware 
						of?</P>
					<P>DR. ARMBRUSTER: when our assays were validated, we did interference studies 
						using the typical interferants that one would test for in urine.</P>
					<P>Obviously, in terms of proficiency testing, for the amphetamines and for PCP it 
						would be the same as for urine testing. For cocaine, we really would have to be 
						challenged probably
					</P>
					<P>by using cocaine, and for THC actually THC and not the metabolite carboxylic 
						acid.</P>
					<P>In opiates, heroin and 6-MAM, which we don't even look for heroin in urine, but 
						that is the major drug we look for in the sweat patch.</P>
					<P>DR. CAIRNS: I think in the hair analysis all the analytes I showed you, the 
						three opiates, the cocaine trio, carboxy THC, but more important we are talking 
						extremely low levels.</P>
					<P>Remember, carboxy THC, in hair the cut off is half a picogram. The question I am 
						often asked is how do we equate the amounts in hair and cut off levels relative 
						to the other matrices.</P>
					<P>You know, it is very difficult to compare a ml of urine to 10 milligrams of 
						hair, considering that the roots that the drug gets into hair are entirely 
						different from those for urine.</P>
					<P>When you consider it and say parts per trillion and parts per billion, that half 
						picogram cut off for carboxy THC is certainly three or four orders of magnitude 
						below what urine testing is involved in.</P>
					<P>I think when you are talking about proficiency testing, the challenge is not in 
						the analyte itself. The challenge is in being able to do that concentration 
						level per 10 milligrams of hair.</P>
					<P>DR. ROHRIG: as far as saliva, you have all the challenges that you have of the 
						other matrices that we need to be aware of.</P>
					<P>Our experience has been mainly cocaine, but if you are looking at amphetamines, 
						if it has been established -- I don't have the answer to this but if there are 
						high levels of pseudoephedrine or something that appears in the oral fluid, 
						then obviously your techniques should be able to, if you are just gearing in on 
						methamphetamine or amphetamine, differentiate and remove that interference.</P>
					<P>You have all the issues if you use a CB derivative and things like that, as far 
						as the artificial formation. So, you have the additional challenges.</P>
					<P>I think that is one thing that separates oral fluid and some of the newer 
						matrices, is information on drug disposition.</P>
					<P>Every time I have a question on that, I try to find one of Ed's subjects and see 
						if they got that sample from them, and look at some of his data to see what I 
						am dealing with.</P>
					<P>DR. CONE: I have a question for Dr. Cairns. I am always worrying about whether 
						people are going to get accused falsely or not.</P>
					<P>I believe it was in your presentation that you said that you are testing for the 
						carboxy acid metabolite of marijuana.</P>
					<P>Did I hear you say also that that does not occur in marijuana smoke? If you did 
						say that, have you actually produced data that would support that contention?</P>
					<P>DR. CAIRNS: I am being logical here, Dr. Cone, in that carboxy THC is a two step 
						metabolic process in the body. How in god's name would I create that in smoke. 
						As a scientist I don't see any rational or logical explanation how I would 
						produce it in smoke. You agree with me on that one, I hope.</P>
					<P>DR. CONE: I don't agree with you. I don't know what occurs in a pyrolysis 
						product at 1,200 degrees.</P>
					<P>DR. CAIRNS: I hardly think a carboxylic acid, such a complex structure, would 
						survive pyrolysis. It would dehydrate right away.</P>
					<P>DR. CONE: It is an extremely simple thing to test, though, is what I am asking. 
						Have you tested it.</P>
					<P>DR. CAIRNS: It is a good point. If I were to try and convince a skeptic like 
						yourself yes, I did an experiment, but you have to agree with me, it is highly 
						improbable.</P>
					<P>DR. CONE: I agree with you.</P>
					<P>I have more of a lighter question for the panel. This is kind of a dumb thing to 
						say, but just for want of discussion, I would like to -- this is something we 
						should probably bring up in the next conference. I assume we will have another 
						one in nine years. But I want to ask it in this conference.</P>
					<P>Let me make a statement first. What I think this country needs is a good 25 cent 
						on-site test for saliva, sweat and hair and identification of drugs of course.</P>
					<P>Do you guys see us going to on-site testing of alternate matrices, and what do 
						you think about the idea?</P>
					<P>DR. CAIRNS: You give me two million samples and I will certainly see the price 
						go down.</P>
					<P>DR. ARMBRUSTER: I think it would be a challenge for sweat considering the low 
						concentrations of the drug. If somebody was willing to pour money into the 
						research I imagine you could come up with such a test.</P>
					<P>With urine I think it would be a lot easier to do on-site testing than with 
						sweat. What I kind of think may happen is that we will take the approach I have 
						always favored in the clinical laboratory, multivariant analysis.</P>
					<P>You take several analytes and you get a bigger answer to what is going on when 
						you look at it all put together instead of just a single analyte.</P>
					<P>Here we have had several specimens giving us different bits and pieces of the 
						puzzle. If you put it all together in a holistic approach and we get more 
						information about what is going on.</P>
					<P>DR. SALAMONE: The antibodies that you would need would be somewhat different, of 
						course, for saliva. Any time we have looked into what the market potential of 
						that was, it just -- it wasn't that great, to put a very big R&amp;D effort 
						into it. There is not a great deal of work going on.</P>
					<P>DR. CAIRNS: Let me ask the question. How would you feel about conformation that 
						did not conform to rigorous forensic standards as we know them today?</P>
					<P>Is there a bartering to reduce those? We have pretty high forensic standards 
						right now, number of ions, ratios, et cetera. Are you indicating you would 
						relax those a little bit to reduce costs in onsite testing?</P>
					<P>DR. CONE: I will respond to that. I really didn't come up to respond to 
						questions but no, I am not advocating lowering the standard.</P>
					<P>I am advocating that, as technology involves, we will have sensitivity in those 
						different areas that will allow you to detect drugs at lower and lower levels.</P>
					<P>I never thought we would be testing at femtogram levels before. So, I can see 
						where we may be heading in the future toward much more sensitive assays than we 
						have now, that could be implemented in onsite testing scenarios.</P>
					<P>DR. SMITH: Ed, I just wanted to say that I can't answer
					</P>
					<P>your question, but I thought that I might give an anecdote.</P>
					<P>When the on-site testing methods and procedures were not as good as they are 
						now, we used them actively in Europe.</P>
					<P>One of the jobs of the drug testing laboratory was kind of as a QC organization. 
						We would try to go to different sites and see which people had positive field 
						screen tests. When they turned up negative in the lab to a great proportion, 
						somebody would go investigate.</P>
					<P>I don't really have any hard statistics, but my sense was, from all the problems 
						we had, almost all of them were operator related. When they went to the site 
						and they trained the operator,
					</P>
					<P>then most of the problems with field testing went away.So, we can have all the 
						good, sensitive and well thought out procedures that we want, but to get back 
						to what Yale said, if the people are not properly trained and that is your 
						principal problem, then that is the problem that we really need to address.</P>
					<P>DR. CONE: You may have Bubba looking at you, too.DR. HILDERBRAND: For the 
						record, I would like to identify
					</P>
					<P>the speakers. I don't know if you need that. Okay, any other questions?</P>
					<P>DR. WILKINS: I just have one quick question for Dr.
					</P>
					<P>Armbruster and Dr. Cairns, and it is a related question. Are calibrators and 
						controls in the confirmation assays prepared in the appropriate matrices in 
						both of those?</P>
					<P>For Dr. Armbruster, for example, are controls prepared by spiking them to the 
						patch and taking them through the elution process? For Dr. Cairns, obviously 
						the same type of question. Are
					</P>
					<P>controls and calibrators made in a hair matrix by fortifying with known 
						concentrations of drugs.</P>
					<P>Then take that one step further, each of you, if you would.
					</P>
					<P>What are the CVs for replicate samples in real samples, not fortified samples.</P>
					<P>My experience has been they are usually higher than in fortified hair samples. I 
						am just curious, in routine specimen analysis, what kind of CVs you typically 
						get.</P>
					<P>DR. ARMBRUSTER: The answer for sweat testing is yes, we find it necessary to 
						duplicate reality to the spike patches. Sometimes we see matrices as well, 
						which we have to duplicate by spiking actual pads.</P>
					<P>Is it possible to defer to somebody else like Bob Vogelson, who would have a 
						better idea of what we typically run for CVs.</P>
					<P>DR. CAIRNS: In hair analysis, you are quite right. We identify some negative 
						hair and prepare what we call a pool negative hair digest. That is the matrix 
						that we spike, say, for carboxylic THC.
					</P>
					<P>We also include in the batch, apart from that part up front that shows linearity 
						as well as capability, we also have what are known as quality control samples, 
						which are hair from users, which we characterized -- it is like an internal 
						proficiency test in its own way.
					</P>
					<P>We have characterized it by multiple assays, taken the mean, and we put that 
						into the batch on a regular basis.</P>
					<P>The CV for those samples on a regular basis is well within 10 or 12 percent.</P>
					<P>DR. WILKINS: Those proficiency tests were those that were alluded to -- I forget 
						which of the speakers mentioned it. I think it may have been Dr. Baumgartner 
						earlier, who mentioned that some of the previously confirmed positive hair 
						specimens were used as quality control. Is that the same material or is that 
						something different?</P>
					<P>DR. CAIRNS: This is bulk hair that we acquire, and homogenize it by cutting it 
						to very small ends, mixing so that we have a fairly homogenous sample.</P>
					<P>Then that is digested as a normal 10 milligram sample and it is like replicate 
						analysis. We have got hundreds of replicates from that batch of hair from a 
						user.</P>
					<P>The CV on that is running between 10 and 12.</P>
					<P>DR. WILKINS: So, that is different from the blind QC.</P>
					<P>DR. CAIRNS: That is different from the blind.</P>
					<P>DR. HUESTIS: I have a couple of questions. First, for on-site tests, would you 
						recommend a percentage of the negative specimens that result from on-site 
						testing that should be sent to confirmation to test the reliability of the 
						on-site testing process.</P>
					<P>DR. SALAMONE: That would have to be determined, but I think it would be a valid 
						way of going, yes, to send a certain percentage of the negative tests.</P>
					<P>DR. HUESTIS: Do you have any recommendation for what that percentage might be at 
						this point?</P>
					<P>DR. SALAMONE: No, I don't have a feel for that.</P>
					<P>DR. HUESTIS: Also, does the fact that you are using a much higher concentration 
						of the urine specimen itself in the on-site device make this technology more 
						susceptible to adulteration.</P>
					<P>DR. SALAMONE: With adulteration, yes, it does. With adulteration what generally 
						happens is that you don't get the test valid sign showing up, or test complete.</P>
					<P>It completely changes the reaction so that you don't -- the reaction just 
						doesn't complete.</P>
					<P>DR. HUESTIS: I have questions for each of the alternative matrix speakers. If 
						you would address the approximate percentage of positive initial tests that are 
						confirmed and how this percentage has driven your selection of confirmation cut 
						offs.</P>
					<P>DR. ROHRIG: As I stated earlier, one of the driving forces for confirmation cut 
						off is to match our urine. That is really one of the major factors as far as 
						hitting it.</P>
					<P>Then you can play statistics as far as screen positives versus confirmed 
						positives. One of the problems we run into with our population -- I was talking 
						to Dr. Peat and he experiences similar things, which doesn't surprise me -- 
						many of our screen positives are also HIV positive.</P>
					<P>That means that a lot of the specimen is already consumed even before it goes to 
						cocaine confirmation. So, we can run anywhere from 10 to 20 percent of these 
						are Q &amp; S. That is, there is just nothing left there to be tested.</P>
					<P>I can say that anywhere from like 50 to 80 percent will confirm positive. That 
						is a wide range, but that is highly variable upon HIV status, smoking status.</P>
					<P>In our laboratory if they screen positive for cotinine, another analyst will go 
						back and take another sample and re-test for cotinine, again consuming more 
						samples.</P>
					<P>I will have to give you just a wide range like 50 up to 80 percent will confirm 
						positive, but that is mainly driven by all the other challenges as far as small 
						specimen size that we have in our particularly unique industry.</P>
					<P>DR. HUESTIS: A comment on that. I understand your reasoning for the insurance 
						industry and why they wanted the testing to be similar to urine.</P>
					<P>It seems to me that we shouldn't be trying to match cut offs or confirmation 
						rates in these different analytical alternative matrices, because they have 
						different windows of detection and certainly should be looked at in their own 
						right.</P>
					<P>DR. ROHRIG: I say it is market driven and we are talking about windows of 
						detection. Again, the actuaries write these complicated mathematical programs 
						determining risk for an individual that is a cocaine user.</P>
					<P>The reason we have such lower confirmations is to match urine, but in a very 
						loose general term we are saying that the window of detection, the surveillance 
						window, is similar to that which we see with urine.</P>
					<P>That is what they are basing it on. Say we have a casual user and we know we are 
						going to pick him up for X number of days. We want to kind of match using 
						whatever matrices.</P>
					<P>The insurance agency could care less if it was saliva, urine, brain tissue, 
						whatever. They want about the same hit rate because that is what all their 
						models are written on.</P>
					<P>DR. CAIRNS: First of all, I think the RIA screening assay is what passes samples 
						through to GC/MS for final confirmation, and that is the system that reports a 
						positive.</P>
					<P>The RIA assays are a little more sensitive, perhaps, than GC/MS. Our 
						confirmation rate from the RIA assay -- one of the great things is that you can 
						compare the RIA volume with the GC/MS volume, and there should be some 
						correlation between the two, so we can see an absolute correlation between 
						screening and confirmation.</P>
					<P>For cocaine it is in the high 90 percent. For the amphetamines it is perhaps 70 
						percent, for PCP it is 100 percent and for carboxy THC there is a variable 
						there going all the way up to 70 and 80 percentage positive rate, from the RIA 
						screen.</P>
					<P>DR. ARMBRUSTER: I don't want to attempt to quote numbers for the positive rates 
						confirmed, but we have much more confidence in the GC/MS confirmatory assays 
						than we do the immunoassays. There is more slop in them, if you will, and they 
						are just not ideal.</P>
					<P>Particularly with THC and cocaine, we tend to have screen false positives and 
						put them through GC/MS and they will not confirm. Part of the problem, I think 
						I alluded to earlier, is sweat
					</P>
					<P>testing is one of the new kids on the block and not every manufacturer of 
						immunoassay kits is willing to sink a lot of time, effort and money into 
						developing an optimal screening assay for sweat testing.</P>
					<P>I still think we have work to do in increasing the analytical sensitivity of the 
						screen assay. So, we don't crow about fantastic screen positive rates when we 
						get to confirm.</P>
					<P>DR. HUESTIS: I think this just emphasizes the importance of controlled clinical 
						studies, again in determining what those confirmation cut off rates should be. 
						Thank you.</P>
					<P>DR. HILDERBRAND: I would like to add one comment to that, Marilyn. There were 
						two locations in the navy that had ETSs, and field tests, not hand held 
						devices. Of course, all the positives were sent on.</P>
					<P>In addition to that, either five or ten percent of the negatives were sent on. 
						That gave a really good handle on the operation of that particular site. It 
						gave good insight into how they were doing.
					</P>
					<P>I believe with that we will close and I will turn this back over to Dr. Bush. 
						Thank you to the panel.</P>
					<P>(Applause.)</P>
					<P>DR. BUSH: Well, thank you very much for an outstanding Monday. May I look 
						forward to tomorrow, and remind you that we start at 8:15, and we will likely 
						go to close to 6:00 o'clock.</P>
					<P>That is an awful lot of good science we are going to review tomorrow. It is 
						going to be a good day. Let's get together and do it again tomorrow morning.</P>
					<P>We will ask you to register again tomorrow morning, because we don't know how 
						many more people are coming in this evening, how many new additions we will 
						have to the audience tomorrow.By rule and regulation, we need to account for 
						who is present from the public to participate in our meeting. So, we will ask 
						you to register again tomorrow. Have your business card out and just ready to 
						put on the table. That is the easy way to do that.On that note, we will see you 
						promptly for start at 8:15.
					</P>
