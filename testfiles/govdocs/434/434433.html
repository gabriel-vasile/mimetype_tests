Discovery...
When recorded entertainment was hard to get
hold of, fans used to dream of having vast libraries of
audio and video material at their fingertips. Thirty years
ago, the range of records you could buy outside major cities and
specialist shops was limited, and when it came to visual entertainment
you got what the broadcast and cinema programmers
wanted to give you. A few fans were committed enough to put in
the time and effort to find out about material outside the mainstream
and then to track it down, but neither of these tasks was
easy and these dedicated detectives were the exception.
In the twenty-first century we live with an economics of
abundance in music, television, film, and games. The internet
has made it possible to track down almost anything, legally or
illegally, with a few clicks of a mouse. We have what fans used
to dream of. There are many more routes; from blogs to reference
sites to online entertainment stores; that lead us to new
material and let us try it out on demand. We are seeing a profound
change in the way we make cultural discoveries. In the
digital age everything is available, with each item vying with the
millions of others, old and new, that can be found in the unlimited
expanse of the internet. Our problem now is scarcity of
attention.
If you want to explore new music nowadays, you might
check out iTunes, subscription services like Rhapsody, free
advertising-supported services such as Napster or Qtrax, and tens
of thousands of niche online radio stations, unlicensed filesharing
sites, or artist videos on MySpace and YouTube. Then
Net, Blogs and Rock 'n' Roll 25/5/07 17:16 Page 1
there are the services popping up everywhere on the net that
analyze what books, music, and films you like and generate a personalized
list of recommendations. Some even put a kind of robot
DJ in your computer or digital music player that sequences a
playlist for you, adapted to your tastes and moods. When friends
recommend a band or a film, you can find out more by consulting
a reference site like allmusic, or perhaps pay a visit to
Wikipedia, an online encyclopedia where anyone can chip in and
contribute their expertise.
All of these routes are part of the digital discovery
process. With the expansion of on-demand access, coupled with
the richness of information and perspectives that comes with blog
culture, we are crossing a watershed. We do not have to depend
so much on coincidences to discover new entertainment that will
tickle our individual fancies. We do not have to go out on a limb
by making risky purchases, or wait for recommendations from
friends. The digital means of research are within easy reach to
even the most casual of consumers: reviews and audience ratings,
historical and career context, lists of related material, and samples
of the material itself.
The central focus of this book is on music discovery; 
how it has changed and how best to respond to these changes; 
because music is a bellwether for other forms of entertainment in
many ways. The fan economy for music has been around for a
long time. It is richly developed within different genres and age
groups. The challenges of unlicensed file sharing hit music first,
and its fans have embraced blogging and social networks in a big
way. The intelligent filtering technologies for making automated
personalized recommendations of stuff you might like to check
out are most advanced in the world of music, because they have
more data to build on. Most of the problems; and the solutions
; in terms of digital discovery are coming to music first. And
where music leads other media may follow: audio and video
downloads on iAmplify; television on Tape It Off The Internet;

The challenges of the fan economy
...Many aspects of the era of abundance are highly
desirable. It offers the enticing prospect of a &quot;celestial jukebox&quot;
where you can pull down almost anything you can think of from
a digital store in the sky and listen to or watch it at your leisure.
But, as with many significant changes, it also brings disruption
and challenges. Google may promise to index and organize all
the world's information, creating a reference source of almost
God-like omniscience, but having information organized for you
is one thing; deciding what to look at next is another. This is
what could be called the &quot;problem&quot; of discovery, and it manifests
itself in different ways for different groups: the creators of entertainment,
its consumers, and the services that connect them.
As creators, whether we've just made a multimilliondollar
film or a three-song demo recording, we want to know how
to attract and hold the attention of an audience that is bombarded
with choice and, once we have hooked them, how we can get our
fans to spread the word and build buzz. As consumers we have to
struggle to keep up with everything that's going on and balance
friends' recommendations with media hype and our own idiosyncratic
hunches. For professional reviewers, broadcasters, and the
new breed of digital stores and services, the problem is how to shift
gears from being the gatekeepers that they were when consumers
had only to decide between Tower Records and an independent
store, Rolling Stone and the New Musical Express, Top of the Pops
and MTV Unplugged, to being facilitators of the interaction
between entertainment and consumers in an era of infinite choice.
And media enterprises need to understand all these changes so they
can develop strategies to meet them head on.
Discovery ...3
Net, Blogs and Rock 'n' Roll 25/5/07 17:16 Page 3
Unsurprisingly, there is no single solution to such challenges.
We pick up the scent of discovery in many different settings,
online and offline: from reviews, discussions, and stories,
from personal recommendations and recommender systems,
overheard exchanges, and from the unusual radio station that was
playing one time in our uncle's kitchen. Because we pick up leads
for discoveries in anarchic ways and all over the place, there can
be no one service that provides an all-encompassing discovery
solution for music, film, books, games, or other domains.
Perhaps the most significant shift that comes with the
economics of abundance is that now we are spoilt for choice in
ways to discover new entertainment, the tables have turned in
terms of who makes the running. Consumers are no longer sheep
who can easily be herded toward some Next Big Thing that has
been hatched up in the studios and marketing departments of television
companies, radio stations, and Hollywood. The means by
which we can find out about interesting new material are limitless:
mainstream television and radio, press, even Amazon and
Yahoo! have to live in a world where we can switch our attention
elsewhere in a few clicks. The producers will seek to shepherd us
toward their offerings, but when it comes down to it, all of us are
free-range explorers.
Net, blogs, and rock 'n' roll
...The potent combination of advances in technology
and the laissez-faire culture of sharing discoveries is
what creates the Net, Blogs and Rock 'n' Roll recipe. The net
provides a platform where data, content, and comment can be
combined and made available to multiple audiences by multiple
routes. Blogs provide the diversity and participation in spreading
buzz, fueled by individual, authentic voices and relationships
between people. Rock 'n' roll injects the attitude and the
4... Net, Blogs and Rock 'n' Roll
Net, Blogs and Rock 'n' Roll 25/5/07 17:16 Page 4
appetite: the sense that life is too short to spend time waiting
for every i to be dotted and every t crossed. The energy comes
from the hips as well as the head; discovery and exploration
are never ending.
The Net, Blogs and Rock 'n' Roll recipe helps us make
sense of the potentially disorientating and ever-evolving landscape
of discovery. Instead of looking out through a restricted
window, like the porthole on a large ship, we can all be on the
bridge of the ship, with a 360-degree view and the captain's prerogative
to steer in whatever direction we choose. More than
that, the copy-and-paste capabilities of digital media and Web 2.0
enable us to remix what we see and re-present our own versions
of it. Songs are no longer welded to the fixed sequence of a vinyl
groove, but can be mixed with others from different sources in a
playlist, or used to soundtrack home movies.
The technologies known as Web 2.0 provide a platform
that enables and accelerates social explorations that reach into
corners of our culture that mass media have largely ignored.
Many of us like some popular hits, but we also like quite a lot of
&quot;non-hits&quot; (it's just that we all like different non-hits, which is
why they are non-hits). In his landmark book The Long Tail,2
Chris Anderson, charts a dramatic change under which sales are
no longer so exclusively concentrated on current hit titles but are
distributed across a wider spectrum, right down to the tail end of
the charts where, thanks to infinite digital shelf space, even
obscure titles are better able to find niche markets. This brings
with it a whole new set of business challenges.
No one is in charge of digital discovery. Blogs and the
&quot;tearable web&quot; are wrenching the reins from professional media
(whose ties with producer industries are sometimes perceived to
be too cosy), making it easy to share opinions, and easy for fans
to help each other. The defining characteristics of blog culture
include:
Discovery ...5
Net, Blogs and Rock 'n' Roll 25/5/07 17:16 Page 5
...&lt;B&gt;An open form of mass participation in media where anyone
can contribute.
...&lt;B&gt;A conversation, not a lecture or a broadcast--there is no
&quot;final word.&quot;
...&lt;B&gt;No commissioners, no editors, self-publishing with no
infrastructure of control.
...&lt;B&gt;Mostly a noncommercial activity (corporate blogs and
mainstream media blogs exist, but are arguably not what
the ethos of blogging is really about).
...&lt;B&gt;The fan economy is a gift economy, rewarded by recognition
and in-kind returns from fellow contributors.
...&lt;B&gt;A focus on the individual, authentic voice.
...&lt;B&gt;Part of a wider activity of personal networking, finding
like-minded souls, and building communities of interest.
Fans and the entertainment industries that service them have to
adapt in order to tap the riches of this era, and understanding
how discovery works is fundamental to this. Consumers can learn
how to exploit and integrate the unprecedented sources of discovery
at their disposal. Creators can help their work find its
market and tap the energies of fans in spreading the word, generating
new revenue opportunities in the long tail. Media businesses
can learn the multimethod techniques that lead to
discovery in order to build their profile with fans and grow their
revenues. And online, broadcast companies, and the press can
come to an understanding of how the landscape has changed,
how discovery has moved to center stage, and how they can best
inform and engage with free-range consumers when their role as
gatekeepers for discovery is on the wane.
Against this background, DIY and independent creators
are well placed to benefit, partly because they have less to lose by
licensing their material, and also because the costs of setting yourself
up and finding a potential audience are falling all the time.
Garageband.com is one such grassroots DIY endeavor, aimed at
6... Net, Blogs and Rock 'n' Roll
Net, Blogs and Rock 'n' Roll 25/5/07 17:16 Page 6
helping musicians and fans help each other. Members can upload
their own recordings, provided they agree for these to be heard
by other members and licensed for inclusion in podcasts without
charge. Members' reviews and ratings provide feedback to the
artists, as well as creating charts of the popularity of different
artists and tracks. From there it's a case of &quot;survival of the
fittest,&quot; as the songs with the best ratings get most exposure to
Garageband.com users and stand a better chance of being discovered.
What is being created through Garageband.com (and similar
sites like Jamendo and Amie Street3) is an amateur economy
that in some ways parallels the mainstream music industry, with
its own bands, critics, DJs (podcasters), fans, and charts.
How to read this book
...Throughout the book I use the metaphor of foraging
for interesting material, which, with the associated idea of
picking up an &quot;information scent,&quot; catches the way discovery can
involve either an extended search or a happy accident when you
catch the smell of something good blowing on the breeze. It also
captures the fact that discoveries frequently depend on mixing
together information and clues from many sources. The first
chapter gives examples of what discovery looks like in practice
and how it works on the net.
Part II outlines how in the fan economy people are taking
discovery into their own hands. While some fear that iPod
culture is cutting people off from each other by enclosing them
in their own personalized cocoons, we will see how communities
of consumers come together and how the volunteer effort of
even small numbers of committed fans can inform and influence
others. Tracking what other people like is a key way of picking
up the scent of new discoveries, and everything from blogs to
charts can help with this.

In Part III we look at the changing role of intermediaries
between creators and their audiences, from critics to the new
breed of social networks and recommender systems that aim to
help us make discoveries. We'll explore how analysis of the
&quot;genetic&quot; make-up of music can help match discoveries to your
personal tastes, and how blog culture and &quot;crowdsourcing&quot; can
augment traditional broadcast and written media, rather then
replacing them.
Part IV shows what new technologies and techniques are
speeding the journey of discovery: how Web 2.0 adds a social
dimension to searching and browsing, while buzz marketing
methods encourage bloggers and fans to spread word-of-mouth
recommendations. This part brings together the previous chapters
into the Net, Blogs and Rock 'n' Roll recipe for discovery.
The final chapters review the implications for consumers,
creators, and the media; and for our shared culture.
Please read the book as though foraging for your own
cues and clues on how digital discovery works. The themes and
patterns that jump out at you will depend on your interests, and
