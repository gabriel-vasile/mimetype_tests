      <a name="content_area"><h1>Anticholinergic Poisoning Associated
with an Herbal Tea -- New York City, 1994 </h1></a>	
<!-- content area --> 


	  	  


<p>Inadvertent anticholinergic poisoning can result from
consumption of foods contaminated with plants that contain
belladonna alkaloids. During March 1994, the New York City
Department of Health (NYCDOH) investigated seven cases of
anticholinergic poisoning in members of three families; three of
the seven ill persons required emergency treatment for
characteristic manifestations. For all cases, manifestations
occurred within 2 hours after drinking tea made from leaves
purchased commercially and labeled as Paraguay tea -- an herbal tea

derived from the plant Ilex paraguariensis, which is native to
South America. This report summarizes the investigation of these
cases. </p>
<p>On March 20, a 39-year-old man and his 38-year-old wife shared

a pot of Paraguay tea. Within 30 minutes after drinking the tea,
both developed acute symptoms (including agitation and flushed
skin). They were transported by ambulance to a local hospital. In
the emergency department, the man was disoriented and agitated.
Findings on examination included fever (101.2 F {38.4 C}), dilated
and nonreactive pupils, and dry skin and oral mucous membranes;
bowel sounds were absent. Anticholinergic poisoning was diagnosed
based on clinical findings, and the New York City Poison Center
(NYCPC) was notified. After treatment with two doses of intravenous

physostigmine (2 mg each over 5 minutes), signs and symptoms
completely resolved. Findings on examination of the woman included
fever (100.8 F {38.2 C}), dilated and nonreactive pupils, and dry
skin and oral mucosa. Her symptoms resolved without treatment. </p>
<p>On March 21, a 20-year-old woman drank approximately 1 cup of
Paraquay tea; approximately 1 hour later, she presented to a local
emergency department with agitation, disorientation, and aphasia
that progressed to stupor. Findings on examination included
increased pulse (120 beats per minute), oral temperature of 98.2 F
(36.8 C), dilated pupils, dry skin, and absent bowel sounds.
Anticholinergic syndrome was diagnosed, and the NYCPC was notified.

She received gastric lavage, activated charcoal, and a cathartic.
Her mental status gradually improved, and she was discharged after
10 hours of observation. </p>
<p>On March 23, four family members shared a pot of tea.
Approximately 1 hour later, the 10-year-old son was transported by
his parents to a local emergency department because of agitation
and restlessness. Findings on examination included increased pulse
(120 beats per minute), dilated and nonreactive pupils, flushed
skin, dry mucous membranes, and hypoactive bowel sounds.
Anticholinergic syndrome was diagnosed, and the NYCPC was notified.

After treatment with two doses of intravenous physostigmine (0.5 mg

each over 5 minutes), his manifestations resolved. Because the
boy's 35-year-old mother and 40-year-old father reported symptoms,
including dry mouth, the emergency department physician
presumptively diagnosed anticholinergic syndrome in both parents.
Their symptoms resolved without treatment. The boy's 18-year-old
brother had left home for school immediately after drinking the
tea. On returning home during the evening of March 23, he reported
confusion and no knowledge of his whereabouts during the day. </p>
<p>At the request of the NYCPC, the emergency department
physicians obtained samples of tea from each family for analysis.
Samples consisted of packages of dried and chopped leaves and stems

wrapped in clear cellophane; the package label identified a New
York City distributor of South American foods. Analysis involved
soaking 5 g of tea in 50 mL of methanol for 4 hours. From 1 uL of
the liquid extract, the belladonna alkaloids atropine, scopolamine,

and hyoscyamine were identified by gas chromatography/mass
spectrometry. Quantitative analysis was not performed. </p>
<p>Investigations by the NYCDOH, the NYCPC, and the Food and Drug

Administration (FDA) indicated that the distributor had purchased
the tea directly from farmers and had shipped it in bulk to New
York City for packaging. Five cases of 24 packs had been delivered
to one grocery store specializing in South American foods. Only one

case had been sold; the remaining four cases were subsequently
quarantined in accordance with New York City health statutes. The
grocery store had no record of persons who had purchased the tea.
On March 24, the NYCDOH issued a news release to educate the public

about the hazards of drinking the contaminated Paraguay tea. No
additional cases of anticholinergic poisoning associated with
Paraguay tea were reported.

<p>Editorial Note: Paraguay tea is made from the leaves of I.
paraguariensis, a 20-foot-tall holly tree indigenous to Argentina,
Brazil, and Paraguay. Common names for the plant include mate,
yerba mate, and South American holly. The leaves contain caffeine,
theophylline, and a nontoxic volatile oil but do not contain
belladonna alkaloids. </p>
<p>The dominant clinical features of the cases described in this
report (i.e., tachycardia, fever, dilated pupils, and flushed skin)

are characteristic of the anticholinergic effects associated with
poisoning by belladonna alkaloids (1). In addition, patients
responded to physostigmine, the treatment of choice for
anticholinergic poisoning. The most likely explanation for the
cases in this report is contamination of the Paraguay tea with
leaves from a plant containing belladonna alkaloids. Previous
reports of inadvertent anticholinergic poisoning resulting from
contamination of foods with plants containing belladonna alkaloids
have included consumption of hamburger seasoned with seeds from
Angels' trumpet (Brugmansia X candida) (2) and consumption of
contaminated honey (3), Chinese herbs (4), or porridge (5). </p>
<p>This report underscores the need for persons who use herbal
products to report any adverse reactions immediately to health
authorities. In 1993, a total of 959 incidents of anticholinergic
poisoning associated with consumption of plants containing
belladonna alkaloids were reported to poison-control centers in the

United States (6); 15 persons had symptoms requiring
hospitalization. Because a large number of plants throughout the
United States contain belladonna alkaloids, plants harvested for
human consumption must be correctly identified. The public should
be aware that all herbal products have the potential to be
misidentified when collected, mislabeled, contaminated, or
adulterated. Physicians and the public should report adverse
reactions to herbal products to FDA's MedWatch Program, telephone
(800) 332-1088 ({301} 738-7553). </p>
