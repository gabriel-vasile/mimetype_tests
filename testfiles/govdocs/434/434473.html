<h3>Board  A-09</h3> <b>Review and evaluation of methods for the analysis of commercial products containing Rauwolfia or Belladonna alkaloids</b><p>U.R.Cieri, FDA</p><p>
<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Reserpine , rescinnamine and deserpidine, alkaloids obtained from the roots of Rauwolfia 
plants are used as hypotensive agents. Commercial products containing reserpine alone 
or in combination with a diuretic were very common thirty or forty years ago but 
their use has dropped dramatically in recent years because other more effective antihypertensive 
agents were developed and marketed. Today there are still a few products containing 
reserpine alone or in combination. Rescinnamine and deserpidine never enjoyed great 
popularity but occasionally a product containing one of these two alkaloids appears 
in the market. Atropine (d-l Hyoscyamine) sulfate and l-Hyoscyamine Sulfate, alkaloids 
obtained from <i>Atropa belladonna</i> or similar plants , have identical chemical structure 
but have different stereo configuration. Commercial products containing a belladonna 
alkaloid are used as anticholinergic, mydriatic or antidiarrheal agents. A review 
is presented of methods, both official and non official, for the analysis of commercial 
products containing a Rauwolfia or a Belladonna alkaloid. An evaluation is also made 
on the specificity and accuracy of each method; the issue of detecting impurities 
and degradants is also discussed briefly.</font></p>
