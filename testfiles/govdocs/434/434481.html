<h1>Illinois Department of Public Aid, DAB No. 667 (1985) </h1>
<p>GAB Decision 667</p>
<p>July 2, 1985 </p>
<p>Illinois Department of Public Aid; <br>
  Ballard, Judith A.; Garrett, Donald F. Settle, Norval D. (John)<br>
  Docket No. 84-248; ACN 05-40205</p>
<p></p>
<p> DECESION</p>
<p>The Illinois Department of Public Aid (Illinois or State) appealed a<br>
  decision of the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) which<br>
  disallowed $235,449 that Illinois claimed under Medicaid as the federal<br>
  share of costs of three drugs. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA)<br>
  had proposed an order finding that the drugs were ineffective, and HCFA<br>
  determined that the drugs were ineligible for federal Medicaid funding.<br>
  Illinois did not dispute the FDA position that the drugs were<br>
  ineffective; rather, Illinois argued that HCFA's notification process<br>
  did not give the State fair notice and enough time to stop use of the<br>
  drugs.</p>
<p>Based on the analysis below, we uphold the disallowance in full for two<br>
  of the drugs. For the third drug, we overturn in part, based on our<br>
  determination that HCFA did not give Illinois the full ninety-day &quot;grace<br>
  period&quot; HCFA said it would give states for initial implementation of the<br>
  HCFA regulation for drugs found ineffective prior to the regulation.</p>
<p>Background: statutory and regulatory provisions.</p>
<p>Section 1903(i)(5) of the Social Security Act prohibits federal payments<br>
  under Medicaid for drugs which are not eligible for Medicaid payments<br>
  under section 1862(c) of the Act. Section 1862(c)(1) prohibits payment<br>
  for a drug which has all four of the following characteristics:</p>
<p> (A) . . . described in section 107(c)(3) of the Drug Amendments of<br>
  1962 (i.e., FDA had earlier approved the drug),</p>
<p> (B) . . . may be dispensed only upon prescription,</p>
<p> (C) for which the Secretary has issued a notice of an opportunity for<br>
  a hearing . . . on a proposed order of the Secretary to withdraw<br>
  approval of an application for such drug product under such section<br>
  because the(2) Secretary has determined that the drug is less than<br>
  effective . . . and</p>
<p> (D) for which the Secretary has not determined there is a compelling<br>
  justification for its medical need. . . .</p>
<p>It is not disputed that the drugs in question in this case were covered<br>
  by the provisions above. These provisions were added to the Social<br>
  Security Act by section 2103 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of<br>
  1981 (Pub. L. 97-35). Under section 2103(b)(2), the prohibition on<br>
  Medicaid payments for ineffective drugs was to apply to &quot;amounts<br>
  expended on or after October 1, 1981.&quot; On October 1, 1981, HCFA<br>
  published an &quot;interim final rule&quot; to implement the prohibition (section<br>
  441.25 of Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations); the provisions<br>
  basically repeated the statute. 46 Fed. Reg. 48554 (October 1, 1981).<br>
  A series of events resulted in a delay in implementation of section 2103<br>
  and its regulations until September 30, 1982. /1/</p>
<p><br>
  Of the four characteristics of an ineligible drug under section 1862(<br>
  c)(1) of the Act, the one important here is (C), which describes a<br>
  process in which the Secretary issues a notice of an opportunity for a<br>
  hearing on a proposed order to disapprove a drug because the drug was<br>
  determined to be less than effective. This notice--generally referred<br>
  to as an &quot;NOOH&quot;--is provided by FDA through publication in the Federal<br>
  Register under delegation from the Secretary. 46 Fed. Reg. 48551<br>
  (October 1, 1981). An example is found in Illinois Exhibit 6. Although<br>
  FDA's NOOH is a proposed action, under the Social Security Act it is<br>
  specifically determinative of a drug's Medicaid and Medicare<br>
  eligibility, apparently because the NOOH reflects an FDA finding of<br>
  ineffectiveness.</p>
<p>The preamble to the HCFA regulation focused on the states' need for time<br>
  to phase in a determination that a drug in use was ineffective. The<br>
  preamble said that HCFA, &quot;in the exercise of (3) (its) enforcement<br>
  discretion,&quot; would allow a one-time ninety-day grace period for initial<br>
  implementation of the regulation, followed by an on-going thirty-day<br>
  grace period following publication of each NOOH. 46 Fed. Reg. 40551-2.<br>
  The preamble also said that HCFA would &quot;notify Medicare contractors and<br>
  Medicaid state agencies&quot; when an NOOH was published in the Federal<br>
  Register. Id.</p>
<p>The drugs involved here and the related NOOHs.</p>
<p>The disallowance dealt with three drugs (vioform 3% hydrocortisone,<br>
  atropine/hyoscine/hyoscyamine c phenobarbital, and belladonna alkaloids<br>
  c phenobarbital). HCFA Exhibit 2. The latter two drugs, atropine and<br>
  belladonna, were the subjects of a NOOH published on May 6, 1983. Id.,<br>
  see also HCFA Exhibit 3, 4th and 6th (unnumbered) pages. Vioform was<br>
  the subject of a NOOH published on September 25, 1981; since HCFA's<br>
  regulations were not effective until October 1, 1982, &quot;the auditors<br>
  assigned the latter date as the date of the NOOH.&quot; HCFA Brief, p. 9, fn.<br>
  4; HCFA Exhibit 2.</p>
<p>The timing of HCFA composite lists.</p>
<p>The HHS auditors' report, issued in June, 1984, covered the period<br>
  October 1, 1982 to December 31, 1983. HCFA Exhibit 2.</p>
<p>HCFA's first composite list of ineffective drugs was distributed in<br>
  October, 1981. According to the auditors, this list was fully<br>
  implemented. Apparently, it did not include the three drugs involved<br>
  here. HCFA Exhibit 2, p. 2. This list is not in the record.</p>
<p>The next list was dated September 30, 1982, and Illinois said it<br>
  received the list on November 3, 1982. Illinois Exhibit 4. This list<br>
  was not mentioned by the federal auditors, nor in the HCFA brief--<br>
  Illinois submitted it. Illinois acknowledged that this list included<br>
  vioform. Illinois Brief, p. 6; Illinois Exhibit 4, p. 15.</p>
<p>An April, 1983, HCFA State Medicaid Manual issuance specified that while<br>
  NOOHs &quot;will be supplied to State agencies through revisions to the State<br>
  Medicaid Manual,&quot; as explained in the immediately following sentence,<br>
  &quot;Payment for these drugs will be terminated on the date of publication<br>
  of the NOOH in the Federal Register.&quot; Illinois Exhibit 8, p. 2. The<br>
  issuance said it had attached to it a January, 1983, revision of earlier<br>
  lists. Id.</p>
<p>A State Medicaid Manual issuance dated September, 1983, transmitted<br>
  another list, which this time (apparently for the first time) included<br>
  atropine and belladonna. HCFA Exhibit 3; Illinois (4) Brief, p. 7;<br>
  Illinois Exhibit 5. On its first page, the issuance specified that<br>
  &quot;Termination of payment for these drugs is determined by the date of<br>
  publication of the NOOH in the Federal Register.&quot;</p>
<p>The auditors found during their visit in early 1984 that Illinois had<br>
  been treating the three drugs involved here as eligible for<br>
  reimbursement, and had not acted to discontinue payment for any of the<br>
  three drugs until the State received the September, 1983 HCFA listing;<br>
  Illinois began terminating payments on December 1, 1983. HCFA Exhibit<br>
  2, p. 3.</p>
<p>The disallowance.</p>
<p>HCFA's disallowance letter repeated earlier statements that federal<br>
  reimbursement had to be terminated on ineffective drugs at the time of<br>
  publication of the NOOH in the Federal Register. Illinois Exhibit 1.<br>
  However, HCFA did not include in the disallowance the payments made for<br>
  the three drugs within the first sixty days after the NOOH publication<br>
  dates. HCFA Brief, p. 10; HCFA Exhibit 2, p. 3. /2/ Thus, for atropine<br>
  and belladonna, for which the NOOH was published on May 6, 1983, HCFA<br>
  disallowed expenditures beginning July 6, 1983. For vioform, for which<br>
  the NOOH date used was October 1, 1982 (the actual date having been<br>
  September 25, 1981), HCFA disallowed expenditures beginning December 1,<br>
  1982. Tape of telephone conference of May 16, 1985.</p>
<p></p>
<p><br>
  The dispute.</p>
<p>HCFA's position basically was that assistance had to be terminated as of<br>
  the date of the NOOH plus the applicable grace period. Illinois's<br>
  position basically was that HCFA should not take a disallowance until<br>
  HCFA had promulgated a separate rulemaking for Medicaid with respect to<br>
  each drug.</p>
<p>(5) Analysis.</p>
<p>A. The NOOH publication date is determinative.</p>
<p>The Social Security Act specifically requires that payments &quot;shall not<br>
  be made&quot; for &quot;any amount expended for any drug product&quot; for which 
  a NOOH<br>
  has been issued. Sections 1903(i), 1903(i)(5), 1862(c). On its face,<br>
  the statute clearly makes the drugs ineligible if a NOOH has been<br>
  issued.</p>
<p>The HCFA regulations are equally specific, essentially repeating the<br>
  statutory provisions with minor modifications immaterial to this<br>
  dispute. /3/ The preamble to the regulations stated that the &quot;statutory<br>
  provision takes effect when the NOOH is published. . . .&quot; 46 Fed. Reg.<br>
  40552 (October 1, 1981).</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>(6) That there was any accommodation at all for the practical exigencies<br>
  of program administration, in the sense of acknowledging a need for lead<br>
  time, was due to HCFA's own exercise of what it termed &quot;enforcement<br>
  discretion&quot; to provide a one-time 90-day start-up grace period and grace<br>
  periods of 30 days from publication of each NOOH. 46 Fed. Reg. 40552<br>
  (October 1, 1981). For this practical approach, HCFA was promptly sued<br>
  by persons who objected to HCFA's accommodation. See fn. 1 on p. 2.</p>
<p>In this case, HCFA's indulgence for atropine and belladonna went even<br>
  beyond that which was afforded in the regulation's preamble: HCFA had<br>
  said it would give 30 days from the publication date of a NOOH, but here<br>
  HCFA gave Illinois 60 days. See fn. 2, supra. There is no question<br>
  that, in terms of the bare words of the statute and the regulation, HCFA<br>
  has been generous. /4/</p>
<p><br>
  A complicating factor is that HCFA indicated it would separately notify<br>
  Medicaid state agencies of NOOHs following their publication in the<br>
  Federal Register. In the preamble to the 1981 regulation, HCFA stated:</p>
<p> When an NOOH is published in the Federal Register, we will notify<br>
  Medicare contractors and Medicaid state agencies. We will expect them<br>
  to forward the information to their providers and suppliers.</p>
<p> We will also distribute and publish in the Federal Register a list of<br>
  all the drugs that have been the subject of an NOOH before the<br>
  publication date of these regulations.</p>
<p> 46 Fed. Reg. 40552.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this language, nothing elsewhere in the regulation or<br>
  the preamble reasonably suggests that anything other than the NOOH<br>
  publication triggered ineligibility; in fact, the preamble was quite<br>
  specific about the effect of the NOOH date:</p>
<p>(7) We will terminate Federal reimbursement under the Medicare Part B<br>
  and Medicaid programs for the affected drugs when FDA has published in<br>
  the Federal Register an NOOH . . .</p>
<p>Although the statute did not specify the length of time between the date<br>
  the NOOH is published and the date we would no longer reimburse for the<br>
  affected drug, we believe it would be virtually impossible to inform all<br>
  interested parties . . . of the FDA's action on the same day the NOOH is<br>
  published. We published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in the<br>
  Federal Register on June 5, 1980 (45 FR 37858) that proposed some<br>
  restrictions in the Medicare and Medicaid policies of reimbursing for<br>
  less than effective drugs. Comments we received in response to that<br>
  NPRM indicated that it would be appropriate to allow at least 30 days<br>
  for notification of interest parties when FDA published a determination<br>
  in the Federal Register. We agree with these comments.</p>
<p>Therefore, although the statutory provision takes effect when the NOOH<br>
  is published, we will, in the exercise of our enforcement discretion,<br>
  grant a grace period of 30 days before we terminate reimbursement under<br>
  this provision . . . for Medicaid, the prohibition on Federal financial<br>
  participation (FFP) would be enforced with respect to drugs purchased by<br>
  or provided to beneficiaries after the 30th day following the<br>
  publication of the NOOH.</p>
<p> 46 Fed. Reg. 40551-2 (October 1, 1981).</p>
<p>The preamble also said the following concerning the one-time ninety-day<br>
  grace period:</p>
<p> . . . we are granting a grace period of 90 days during which we will<br>
  not deny reimbursement for the affected drugs, nor will we audit or<br>
  disallow Federal funds for any of the affected drugs because they are<br>
  subject to an NOOH.</p>
<p> * * *</p>
<p> . . . For the Medicaid program, we are allowing 90 days to provide<br>
  States with sufficient time to make any necessary changes in their<br>
  claims processing systems to implement these regulations. In addition,<br>
  it will be necessary for Medicare contractors and Medicaid state<br>
  agencies to notify their providers and suppliers.</p>
<p> (8) On January 1, 1982, the prohibition on Federal reimbursement will<br>
  be enforced under . . . Medicaid for any drug that was the subject of an<br>
  NOOH published before December 2, 1981. For any NOOH published on or<br>
  after December 2, the 30-day rule will apply. For example, Federal<br>
  reimbursement for expenses incurred for a drug product that is the<br>
  subject of an NOOH published December 31, 1981, will be denied beginning<br>
  January 31, 1982.</p>
<p> Id., p. 40552.</p>
<p>It is unreasonable to draw any interpretation from these materials other<br>
  than than ineffective drugs were ineligible for federal funding from the<br>
  date of the NOOH plus the applicable grace period. HCFA did say it<br>
  planned to publicize NOOHs, but, in context, there is no reasonable<br>
  linkage between that promise of information and the substantive<br>
  determination of ineligibility: everything clearly stated that the<br>
  latter directly tied to the moment of publication of the NOOH. The<br>
  preamble's statement about HCFA's notification intentions is at best<br>
  only impliedly inconsistent with the rest of the preamble, and then,<br>
  only if read out of context. The rest of the preamble made it clear<br>
  that the NOOH publication date controlled. Moreover, while HCFA in fact<br>
  stated it would provide followup notification, it gave no guarantee that<br>
  notification would come at any particular time during the grace period<br>
  or even within the grace period at all. Thus, the State should have<br>
  known that the only certain way to assure Medicaid reimbursement was to<br>
  depend on the Federal Register NOOH, not the subsequent notification.<br>
  The State here was not dependent on some obscure form of notice;<br>
  rather, the Federal Register is a formal nationwide vehicle for<br>
  disseminating information related to federal programs. Finally, even if<br>
  the notification provision was inconsistent, Illinois would have been<br>
  unreasonable in relying on a questionable interpretation without further<br>
  inquiry.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we will not condone a dangerously passive approach to the<br>
  problem of ineffective drugs. Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries' use<br>
  of ineffective drugs can be hazardous, and the State clearly had an<br>
  obligation to move as quickly as it reasonably could to stop reliance on<br>
  these drugs. The State itself recognized the importance of removing<br>
  ineffective drugs from use. Illinois Brief, pp. 17-22; Illinois Reply<br>
  Brief, p. 2. This obligation to Illinois citizens went beyond<br>
  accountability to HCFA for federal dollars. Drug effectiveness is a<br>
  technical matter controlled by a process outside routine HCFA/state<br>
  interactions related to administrative and fiscal issues. Illinois<br>
  acknowledged that it had a unit within its organization with the (9)<br>
  responsibility to oversee drug safety and effectiveness. Tape of<br>
  Telephone Conference. Indeed, the date stamp on several HCFA documents<br>
  Illinois submitted shows them received in the &quot;Div. of Food, Drugs and<br>
  Dairies&quot; of the Illinois Department of Public Health. See, e.g.,<br>
  Illinois Exhibits 4, 5. Illinois also surely had mechanisms in place<br>
  for reviewing Federal Register material relevant to its Medicaid and<br>
  Medicare programs. /5/ Unlike the typical HCFA dispute before this<br>
  Board, this one does not merely involve a question of allowability of<br>
  costs under HCFA criteria; here, the dispute also directly involves the<br>
  well-being of persons affected by an FDA determination of drug<br>
  effectiveness. Surely, Illinois needed to do more than sit by idly,<br>
  waiting indefinitely for publication of a notice from HCFA listing drugs<br>
  already listed in FDA's publication of NOOHs. HCFA arguably might have<br>
  done a better job of getting its composite lists out, but the lists were<br>
  only a way to gather together in one convenient place a description of<br>
  NOOHs issued to date. The use of delayed composite lists should not<br>
  divert attention from the clear linkage between NOOH dates and drug<br>
  ineligibility.</p>
<p><br>
  B. No extra rulemaking was required.</p>
<p>Illinois's argument was that &quot;FDA's NOOH is not HCFA's rule&quot; and 
  that<br>
  HCFA must also publish a rule to terminate payment for each drug for<br>
  which a NOOH is issued. Illinois Brief, p. 11. Illinois bases this<br>
  position on the requirement in the Administrative Procedure Act for<br>
  publication of rules, arguing that &quot;each time HCFA proposes to terminate<br>
  payment for a less than effective drug, HCFA's action constitutes a<br>
  rule.&quot; Id., p. 9. We disagree. 42 CFR 441.25 is this Department's rule<br>
  of general applicability which controls this dispute, and that rule was<br>
  properly published in 1981. What the rule says is that no federal<br>
  funding is available for a drug which is the subject of a NOOH<br>
  (published in the Federal Register by FDA) which of course is precisely<br>
  what the underlying statute says. Indeed, there has been no<br>
  administrative embroidery on what Congress commanded; HCFA has simply<br>
  done nothing more than what the statute said it has to do. HCFA is not<br>
  engaged in any legislative rulemaking under the APA when it treats a<br>
  NOOH as dispositive, but rather HCFA is doing something almost<br>
  ministerial (10) in nature--the precise act specifically commanded by<br>
  statute. Illinois argued that HCFA's role is not ministerial because<br>
  discretion is involved in determining which drugs are ineffective.<br>
  Illinois Reply Brief, p. 4. We disagree, because the earlier<br>
  determination is FDA's, and once FDA publishes its NOOH in the Federal<br>
  Register, HCFA has no choice under the law but to stop payment for the<br>
  drug. Furthermore, to require a separate HCFA publication for each drug<br>
  in a NOOH would be unnecessarily duplicative and contrary to the public<br>
  interest. HCFA has no discretion to choose which NOOH drugs it will<br>
  treat as ineligible for funding; every NOOH drug is ineligible by law.<br>
  This duplication would also produce further delay in removing<br>
  ineffective drugs from use. See HCFA Brief, pp. 14-15. In fact,<br>
  Illinois argued that the extra HCFA promulgation it wanted should not<br>
  itself be effective for a further thirty days under the APA. Illinois<br>
  Brief, pp. 12-15; Illinois Reply Brief, p. 3. We also note that 42 CFR<br>
  441.25, although published as an interim final rule, did, in fact,<br>
  reflect earlier public comments on implementation timing received in<br>
  response to a notice of proposed rulemaking on restrictions on<br>
  ineffective drugs published before passage of Pub. L. 97-35. 45 Fed.<br>
  Reg. 37858 (June 5, 1980). HCFA specifically developed the thirty-day<br>
  grace period in response to those public comments. 46 Fed. Reg. 40552<br>
  (October 1, 1981).</p>
<p>C. Illinois could not reasonably rely on HCFA lists instead of NOOHs.</p>
<p>Illinois argued that HCFA had &quot;indicated&quot; that Illinois should rely 
  on<br>
  the HCFA composite lists. Illinois Brief, p. 15. The State says,<br>
  however, that the notices were &quot;not entirely clear&quot; and &quot;quite<br>
  confusing.&quot; Id., pp. 15 and 16.</p>
<p>We refer the reader to our decision above at pages 5 through 9, where we<br>
  discussed how the statutory and regulatory context clearly made the NOOH<br>
  determinative of eligibility. We will not repeat that analysis here,<br>
  but it is important here, because it shows that from the outset, any<br>
  interpretation to the contrary would at least be sufficiently<br>
  questionable so that a state should not implement it without further<br>
  inquiry--particularly if faced with later guidance it admittedly found<br>
  confusing.</p>
<p>Beside the preamble to the regulation, the State Medicaid Manual<br>
  issuances with lists--the ones from April, 1983 and September, 1983--<br>
  both specifically stated that termination of payment for ineffective<br>
  drugs was determined by reference to the date of publication of the NOOH<br>
  in the Federal Register. HCFA Exhibits 3 and 4.</p>
<p>(11) The record also contains a January 11, 1984, guidance document<br>
  published by the Public Health Service which refers to use of a &quot;HCFA/<br>
  NOOH&quot; list to determine reimbursement for drugs. Illinois Brief, pp.<br>
  16-17; Illinois Exhibit 9; HCFA Exhibit 5. This document is outside<br>
  the period in question here. The audit involved here covered the period<br>
  October 1, 1982 to December 31, 1983, and this January, 1984 document<br>
  would be no basis for Illinois's actions in the earlier time frame.<br>
  Furthermore, the document is ambiguous, in that read as a whole, it may<br>
  as easily be interpreted as clarifying the use and effect thereafter of<br>
  earlier HCFA compilations. /6/ Whatever the case, we find that the<br>
  document is no basis to hold that Illinois could have ignored NOOH dates<br>
  during the audited period. Furthermore, a later list, dated November,<br>
  1984, again specified that termination of payment is determined by NOOH<br>
  publication. Illinois Exhibit 12.</p>
<p><br>
  D. The time Illinois needs to react to notices generally.</p>
<p>Illinois argued at length that it needs 60 days to respond to HCFA's<br>
  determinations that drugs are ineffective. Illinois Brief, pp. 17-22;<br>
  Illinois Reply Brief, pp. 10-12. While the State's argument is well<br>
  stated, it is not one to which the Board can respond. HCFA actually<br>
  gave Illinois 60 days here (albeit from the date of the NOOH). Illinois<br>
  actually is arguing that it needs 60 days from a different sort of<br>
  notice from HCFA, but, as discussed above, we conclude that HCFA took a<br>
  reasonable position in this case in tying drug ineligibility to the<br>
  NOOH. To the extent Illinois's argument raises a policy issue of how<br>
  HCFA should handle these matters in the future, the argument deals with<br>
  a matter beyond the Board's powers. Illinois may wish to submit its<br>
  views to HCFA management.</p>
<p>E. The special circumstances involving vioform.</p>
<p>Although we have determined that the provisions of the Act and<br>
  implementing regulations compel us to uphold the disallowance for costs<br>
  of atropine and belladonna, we conclude that part of the disallowance<br>
  for vioform was unreasonable under HCFA's own policy. Unlike the other<br>
  two drugs, vioform was the subject of a NOOH dated September 25, 1981,<br>
  prior to publication of HCFA's section(12) 441.25 regulation on October<br>
  1, 1981 (and, in fact, prior to the effective date of the law, which was<br>
  also October 1, 1981). HCFA had said in the preamble to its<br>
  regulations:</p>
<p> We will also distribute and publish in the Federal Register a list of<br>
  all the drugs that have been the subject of an NOOH before the<br>
  publication date of these regulations. Although this regulation is<br>
  effective October 1, 1981, we are, in the exercise of our enforcement<br>
  discretion, allowing a 90-day grace period. Therefore, the prohibition<br>
  against Federal reimbursement will be enforced for these drugs beginning<br>
  January 1, 1982.</p>
<p> * * *</p>
<p> For the Medicaid program, we are allowing 90 days to provide States<br>
  with sufficient time to make any necessary changes in their claims<br>
  processing systems to implement these regulations. In addition, it will<br>
  be necessary for Medicare contractors and Medicaid State agencies to<br>
  notify their providers and suppliers.</p>
<p> 46 Fed. Reg. 40552.</p>
<p>HCFA thus clearly stated it would allow a one-time, front-end<br>
  implementation period of 90 days from the moment its regulations became<br>
  effective for drugs whose NOOHs were published before the regulations.<br>
  There is no basis in the record here to argue that states needed less<br>
  than 90 days just because the effective date of the regulation was<br>
  delayed (and HCFA makes no such argument).</p>
<p>We note also that the audit report indicates that HCFA provided a list<br>
  of ineffective drugs in October, 1981 (presumably after the regulation<br>
  was published) but that this list did not include vioform. /7/</p>
<p><br>
  (13) The first list that included vioform was the list which HCFA issued<br>
  on September 30, 1982 and Illinois says it received on November 3, 1982.<br>
  While, as we have stated, Illinois had a clear duty to watch for and<br>
  implement NOOHs issued after the law and HCFA regulations became<br>
  effective (as in the case of atropine and belladonna), the circumstances<br>
  are different for vioform. HCFA specifically told the states that HCFA<br>
  would list pre-regulation NOOHs for them. Since the states were not<br>
  told to depend on NOOHs until the regulation was published, it was<br>
  reasonable for the states to rely on HCFA to provide a list of<br>
  pre-regulation NOOHs. Yet HCFA's first list after the regulation did<br>
  not include vioform, and a later list which did include vioform was not<br>
  distributed for about a year, roughly at the same time the HCFA<br>
  regulations became effective.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it appears arbitrary to allow Illinois a sixty-day<br>
  retroactive grace period while denying Illinois the ninety days it<br>
  appears entitled to under the preamble. HCFA never provided for any<br>
  such sixty-day period, but HCFA specifically did provide for ninety<br>
  days. The sixty-day period was an ad hoc creation, and was reasonable<br>
  as far as it went; but we can discern no reasonable basis in the record<br>
  for saying that Illinois may have sixty days but not ninety.</p>
<p>Based on the foregoing, we conclude that HCFA should recompute the<br>
  disallowance to exclude amounts related to vioform for the period of<br>
  ninety days from the effective date of the regulation, which was October<br>
  1, 1982. /8/</p>
<p><br>
  (14) Conclusion</p>
<p>Based on the foregoing analysis, we uphold the disallowance for atropine<br>
  and belladonna. We also uphold the disallowance for vioform, except<br>
  that we overturn that part of the disallowance which relates to charges<br>
  for vioform during the period of ninety days from October 1, 1982. HCFA<br>
  should recompute the disallowance accordingly. /1/ In response to a<br>
  lawsuit by the National Council of Senior Citizens, a court<br>
  found HCFA's promulgation invalid (primarily because of a &quot;grace period&quot;<br>
  allowed for initial implementation). Congress then passed a law (Pub.<br>
  L. 97-72) including a provision which prohibited implementation of<br>
  section 2103 and the regulations. A later law (Pub. L. 97-161)<br>
  extended the effective date of Pub. L. 97-72 through September 30, 1982.<br>
  Then, a provision of a third law (Pub. L. 97-248) required<br>
  implementation of section 2103 effective September 30, 1982. See 1<br>
  Medicare and Medicaid Guide (CCH) para. 4147, n. 26; Illinois Exhibit<br>
  4; HCFA Exhibit 4. /2/ The auditors' explanation of the<br>
  sixty-day exclusion was as follows: The (disallowance) excludes<br>
  payments for these drugs made within the first 60 days after the NOOH<br>
  dates. These payments were excluded to (i) allow for the 30-day grace<br>
  period and (ii) to prevent the inclusion of drugs paid, after the NOOH<br>
  date, with a date of service prior to the NOOH date. HCFA Exhibit 2, p.</p>
<p>Prohibition on FFP (i.e., federal financial participation) for certain<br>
  prescribed drugs. (a) FFP is not available in expenditures for the<br>
  purchase or administration of any drug product that meets all of the<br>
  following conditions: (1) The drug product was approved by the Food and<br>
  Drug Administration (FDA) before October 10, 1962. (2) The drug product<br>
  is available only through prescription. (3) The drug product is the<br>
  subject of a notice of opportunity for hearing issued under section<br>
  505(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and published in the<br>
  FEDERAL REGISTER on a proposed order of FDA to withdraw its approval for<br>
  the drug product because it has determined that the product is less than<br>
  effective for all its labeled indications. (4) The drug product is<br>
  presently not subject to a determination by FDA, made under its efficacy<br>
  review program (see 21 CFR 310.6 for an explanation of this program),<br>
  that there is a compelling justification of the drug product's medical<br>
  need. (b) FFP is not available in expenditures for the purchase or<br>
  administration of any drug product that is identical, related, or<br>
  similar, as defined in 21 CFR 310.6, to a drug product that meets the<br>
  conditions of paragraph (a) of this section. /4/ Cf.<br>
  Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare, Decision No. 346, September<br>
  30, 1982, where HCFA argued that there was no choice under law and<br>
  regulation but to deny all Medicaid funding for medically necessary<br>
  abortions made ineligible by a statutory amendment, despite the State's<br>
  lack of opportunity to give recipients ten days prior notice required by<br>
  HCFA regulation. /5/ Counsel for Illinois acknowledged that<br>
  someone in the Appellant's organization likely saw the NOOHs. Tape of<br>
  Telephone Conference. It is common knowledge, and Illinois did not<br>
  deny, that state agencies have offices which regularly review the<br>
  Federal Register for relevant items. Id. /6/ This is<br>
  essentially what HCFA said it meant. HCFA also stated that it was and<br>
  continues to be HCFA policy to rely on the NOOH date. Undated letter<br>
  from HCFA Counsel to the Board (in response to a Board question),<br>
  bearing date of receipt of June 19, 1985; Tape of Telephone Conference.<br>
  /7/ The audit report says that Illinois reacted to the October, 1981,<br>
  list by removing the drugs from its authorized drug list by December,<br>
  1981, and stopping all payments for these drugs by October, 1982. The<br>
  audit report then says that a later list included several<br>
  less-than-effective drugs, including vioform, &quot;which were not included<br>
  on the October 1981 listing.&quot; HCFA Exhibit 2, p. 2. /8/ Illinois asked<br>
  for the disallowance to be overturned through January 2, 1983, on the<br>
  basis that it should receive the benefit of sixty days from the date it<br>
  received HCFA's listing of NOOHs containing vioform (November 3, 1982).<br>
  Illinois Brief, p. 8. Although there may be little or no difference in<br>
  the amount as calculated the Board's way, it should be noted that we do<br>
  not agree with the State's position. As we have already discussed, we<br>
  do not consider receipt of the lists to be the operative notice point<br>
  under the law and regulations. Illinois conceded the portion of the<br>
  disallowance for payments for vioform after January 2, 1983. Id.</p>
