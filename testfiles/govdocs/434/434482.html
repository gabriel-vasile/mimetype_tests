****:THE NIGHTSHADE FAMILY

In our forest preserves we frequently find a vine-like plant, with long&nbsp;
slender woody stems, twining or climbing at the base of a big tree. It is&nbsp;
also found next to buildings, along fence rows and on ditch banks. It&nbsp;
has modest clusters of blue 5-lobed flowers with yellow centers, and&nbsp;
these are followed in mid-summer by little scarlet berries, with thin&nbsp;
transparent skins. that look like tiny tomatoes. They should not be&nbsp;
eaten, because they are mildly poisonous. This is the Climbing or&nbsp;
Bittersweet Nightshade introduced from Europe but now naturalized&nbsp;
and widespread in this country.

The Nightshade Family has about 1700 species, most of them native to&nbsp;
or originating in the tropics. It includes the "Irish" potatoes, the&nbsp;
tomatoes, the eggplant and the peppers. Several plants famous for their&nbsp;
narcotic and poisonous properties belong to this strange family,&nbsp;
notably: tobacco, belladonna or Deadly Nightshade, henbane, and the&nbsp;
Jimson Weed. So do such ornamental species as the petunias,&nbsp;
matrimony vine, and the Jerusalem Cherry.

Belladonna, which has escaped from cultivation as a drug plant and&nbsp;
become naturalized in some parts of eastern United States, is a shrub&nbsp;
with purple bell-shaped flowers and shiny black cherry-like berries. The&nbsp;
Black Nightshade also bears drooping black berries but it is a&nbsp;
herbaceous plant and has white flowers. One kind was introduced from&nbsp;
Europe but others are native here. In Iowa, Nebraska, and along the&nbsp;
Pacific Coast, the berries are used in pies and preserves. A cultivated&nbsp;
variety called "wonder berry" has been developed.

The Ground Cherry or Husk Tomato is another kind of nightshade, and&nbsp;
there are any species native to the United States. The most common one&nbsp;
in this region is found in meadows and old fields, usually on poor soil.&nbsp;
The round yellow berry is enclosed in an inflated papery husk&nbsp;
resembling a Japanese lantern. Unripe, the berries have a strong&nbsp;
unpleasant taste but when ripe they taste somewhat like tomatoes and&nbsp;
can be eaten raw or cooked to make preserves.

The Bull Nettle or Silver-leaf Nightshade, native here, has spiny stems&nbsp;
and prickly silvery-white leaves, blue flowers, and a juicy yellow or&nbsp;
orange berry full of seeds. Very similar but having green leaves and&nbsp;
pale violet or white flowers, is the Horse Nettle or Sand Brier native in&nbsp;
our southern states and now widely spread over the central and eastern&nbsp;
states.

The Sand Bur or Beaked Nightshade, is a pest that grows in waste&nbsp;
places and especially on sandy soils. The plant is small, very prickly,&nbsp;
with yellow flowers. It bears numerous little berries each enclosed in a&nbsp;
bur with long, very sharp spines. These cling to your clothing or to the&nbsp;
feet and legs of animals, get between a dog's toes, and cause much&nbsp;
anguish to barefoot boys.

Jimson Weed, so-called because the early colonists in Jamestown&nbsp;
became crazed after eating it, is a tropical plant often found in hog lots&nbsp;
and barnyards. It is a tall coarse plant with white or violet funnel-
shaped flowers and large spiny fruits. It stinks. Some people get a bad&nbsp;
rash by merely touching it. All parts of it contain a deadly poison.
