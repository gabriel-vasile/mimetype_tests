  Decision No. 1366</P>
<P>DECISION</P>
<P>Background</P>
<P>Fourteen states appealed determinations by the Health Care 
Financing<BR>Administration (HCFA) disallowing federal financial participation 
(FFP)<BR>claimed by the States under Title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social 
Security<BR>Act (Act). 1/&nbsp; HCFA, on the basis of audits performed by the 
Office of<BR>the Inspector General (OIG) of the Department of Health and 
Human<BR>Services (DHHS), determined that the States had claimed FFP for 
drug<BR>products that were ineligible for Medicaid reimbursement because 
the<BR>drug products had been deemed either ineffective or "identical, 
related,<BR>or similar" to ineffective drugs.</P>
<P>These appeals arose over a two-year period and were assigned to either<BR>one 
of two Board Members, and thus.both have signed this decision as<BR>Presiding 
Board Members.&nbsp; Once the Board realized that the same drug<BR>products were 
the subject of disallowances for the different States, the<BR>Board proposed 
that these appeals be coordinated.&nbsp; The parties agreed to<BR>this 
proposal.&nbsp; These appeals were then stayed for approximately nine<BR>months 
while HCFA reexamined the disallowances.&nbsp; HCFA eventually decided<BR>not to 
withdraw any of the disallowances.</P>
<P>The Board has previously examined issues related to drug effectiveness<BR>in 
three decisions.&nbsp; In Illinois Dept. of Public Aid, DAB No. 667 
(1985)<BR>(Illinois), the Board decided that once the Food and Drug 
Administration<BR>(FDA) publishes a notice that a drug product is 
less-than-effective<BR>(LTE) in the Federal Register, states are put on notice 
that Medicaid<BR>reimbursement for the drug product ceases from the date of the 
Federal<BR>Register notice, plus an applicable grace period.&nbsp; The 
Board<BR>specifically rejected the argument that HCFA had the&nbsp; 
sole<BR>responsibility for identifying ineffective drug products which 
were<BR>ineligible for FFP:</P>
<P>&nbsp;[W]e will not condone a dangerously passive approach to 
the<BR>&nbsp;problem of ineffective drugs.&nbsp; Medicare and 
Medicaid<BR>&nbsp;beneficiaries' use of ineffective drugs can be hazardous, 
and<BR>&nbsp;the State clearly had an obligation to move as quickly as 
it<BR>&nbsp;reasonably could to stop reliance on these drugs.</P>
<P>Illinois at 8.</P>
<P>In Pennsylvania Dept. of Public Welfare, DAB No. 836 (1986), the 
Board<BR>found that states are also required to cease Medicaid payments for 
other<BR>drugs products not specifically named in a Federal Register notice, 
but<BR>which are "identical, related, or similar" to drugs named in the 
Federal<BR>Register (IRS drugs).&nbsp; The Board further found that, in the 
particular<BR>circumstances of that case, Pennsylvania's pharmacist would have 
had no<BR>meaningful difficulty, after consulting such national drug compendia 
as<BR>the National Drug Code Directory and "Facts and Comparisons," 
in<BR>determining in a relatively short period of time the IRS drug status 
of<BR>the drug products at issue in that case.</P>
<P>In Louisiana Dept. of Health and Human Resources, DAB No. 1083 
(1989)<BR>(Louisiana), the Board explored further the process by which a state 
is<BR>able to determine whether a drug product is an IRS drug.&nbsp; The 
Board<BR>found that many IRS drugs can easily be identified from 
compendia<BR>commonly used by pharmacists, and that these drug.products 
therefore<BR>should be treated the same as FDA-specified LTE drugs.&nbsp; The 
Board also<BR>found, however, that a state was not responsible for the 
identification<BR>of all possible IRS drugs, noting that many drug products do 
not appear<BR>in the various compendia commonly used by pharmacists:</P>
<P>&nbsp;It is debatable as to what extraordinary lengths 
Louisiana<BR>&nbsp;should have gone to ferret out the information, but there is 
no<BR>&nbsp;HCFA rule or guideline establishing the extent of 
Louisiana's<BR>&nbsp;obligation . . . . In this context, Louisiana should not 
be<BR>&nbsp;held, with the benefit of hindsight, to be culpable for 
not<BR>&nbsp;doing the virtually impossible.&nbsp; The State should not be 
denied<BR>&nbsp;FFP for the continued use of such a drug until such time as 
HCFA<BR>&nbsp;or FDA informed the State that the drug was an IRS drug, or 
the<BR>&nbsp;drug appeared in compendia, or the State otherwise 
discovered<BR>&nbsp;(or reasonably should have) that the drug was an IRS 
drug.</P>
<P>Louisiana at 16 (emphasis in original).&nbsp; The Board thus found that, 
in<BR>the absence of any publication by HCFA or the FDA of what drug 
products<BR>are considered IRS drugs, a reasonableness standard should be 
applied in<BR>determining a state's responsibility for the identification of an 
IRS<BR>drug.</P>
<P>In these appeals, disallowed claims for both LTE and IRS drugs are 
at<BR>issue.&nbsp; While the disallowed drug products vary from state to 
state,<BR>each State had claims disallowed for at least one, if not all, of 
the<BR>following three drug products:&nbsp; Bellergal, an alleged IRS 
drug;<BR>dipyridamole, an alleged LTE drug; and Naldecon and 
Naldecon-related<BR>drugs, all alleged IRS drugs. 2/&nbsp; The States disputed 
whether these drug<BR>products were, in fact, LTE drugs or IRS drugs, and 
whether the States<BR>had sufficient information to make those determinations. 
3/&nbsp; .The States<BR>also appealed disallowances for other alleged IRS drugs, 
but did not<BR>offer specific arguments for these drug products, suggesting 
rather that<BR>the whole process by which HCFA assigns the responsibility for 
the<BR>identification of IRS drugs to the States should be invalidated.&nbsp; 
The<BR>States also challenged the audit process from which the 
disallowances<BR>resulted.</P>
<P>Summary of Holdings</P>
<P>For the reasons discussed below, and as described more fully in 
the<BR>conclusion to this decision, we reach the following conclusions.&nbsp; 
The<BR>disallowances relating to Bellergal are sustained.&nbsp; The 
disallowances<BR>relating to dipyridamole are reversed.&nbsp; The disallowances 
relating to<BR>Naldecon are reversed, except for those claims after actual 
notice to<BR>the States of HCFA's position.&nbsp; We decline to invalidate 
either the<BR>process of State responsibility in the identification of and 
termination<BR>of payment for LTE and IRS drugs or the audit review process 
which<BR>resulted in these disallowances, except for certain 
recalculations<BR>explained below.&nbsp; Disallowances for other drugs about 
which the States<BR>made no specific arguments, except these challenges to the 
system, are<BR>sustained.</P>
<P>Overview of the Drug Review Process</P>
<P>The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. .<BR>301 
et seq., establishes a system of premarketing clearance for drugs<BR>and 
prohibits the introduction into commerce of any "new drug" unless a<BR>new drug 
application (NDA) filed with the FDA establishes the safety of<BR>that 
drug.&nbsp; Under the FFDCA, a "new drug" is one not generally<BR>recognized by 
qualified experts as safe for its intended use.&nbsp; In the<BR>Drug Amendments 
of 1962, Public Law 87-781, Congress amended the FFDCA<BR>to direct the FDA to 
refuse approval of a NDA and to withdraw any<BR>approval for NDAs if, after 
notice and opportunity for a hearing, it<BR>found a lack of evidence that the 
drug product involved was effective as<BR>well as safe for use under the 
conditions prescribed, recommended, or<BR>suggested in its labeling.</P>
<P>The FFDCA provides an exemption from the definition of a "new drug," if<BR>a 
product was subject to the 1906 Food and Drug Act and "if its 
labeling<BR>contained the same representations concerning the conditions of 
its<BR>use." .21 U.S.C. . 321(p)(1).&nbsp; The 1962 amendments perpetuated 
this<BR>exemption, in a provision commonly referred to as the 
"grandfather"<BR>clause, as follows:</P>
<P>&nbsp;In the case of any drug which on the day immediately 
preceding<BR>&nbsp;the enactment date, (A) was commercially used or sold in 
the<BR>&nbsp;United States, (B) was not a new drug as defined by 
section<BR>&nbsp;201(p) of the basic Act as then in force, and (C) was 
not<BR>&nbsp;covered by an effective application under section 505 of 
that<BR>&nbsp;Act, the amendments made by this Act shall not apply to 
such<BR>&nbsp;drug when intended solely for use under conditions 
prescribed,<BR>&nbsp;recommended, or suggested in labeling with respect to such 
drug<BR>&nbsp;on that day.</P>
<P>Section 107(c)(4) of Public Law 87-871.</P>
<P>Most of the new drug products that were introduced in the market 
through<BR>the new drug procedures from 1938 to 1962 were submitted to a 
scientific<BR>board to determine the drug product's effectiveness for all 
conditions<BR>in its labeling.&nbsp; Each sponsor of a drug product with a 
1938-1962 NDA<BR>was required to submit to the FDA evidence for its labeled 
indications.<BR>After 1962 no new drug was allowed to be marketed unless it 
received<BR>approval from the FDA for safety and effectiveness for its 
labeled<BR>indication through the NDA process.</P>
<P>The FDA's conclusions on a drug product's effectiveness in the 
Drug<BR>Efficacy Study Implementation (DESI) program are published in 
the<BR>Federal Register as DESI notices and Notices of Opportunity for 
Hearing<BR>(NOOH).&nbsp; Each DESI notice and NOOH is assigned a DESI number, 
which<BR>applies to all of the drug products covered by the notice.&nbsp; If the 
drug<BR>product is effective for all its labeled indications, then the 
DESI<BR>notice will state the marketing conditions for the drug product.&nbsp; 
If the<BR>drug product is effective for some labeled indications, the DESI 
notice<BR>will state the marketing conditions for those effective 
labeled<BR>indications.&nbsp; If the drug product lacks substantial evidence 
of<BR>effectiveness for all its labeled indications, a NOOH is published 
in<BR>the Federal Register.&nbsp; The NOOH gives notice to the sponsor of the 
LTE<BR>drug product, and any interested party, which includes the 
manufacturer<BR>or distributor of a drug product identical, related, or similar 
to the<BR>LTE drug, of an opportunity to request a hearing and submit data 
to<BR>demonstrate the drug product's effectiveness.</P>
<P>Publication of a NOOH in the Federal Register results in ineligibility<BR>for 
reimbursement under the Medicare and Medicaid programs for the LTE<BR>drug and 
IRS drugs.&nbsp; Denial.of FFP begins after a grace period of 30<BR>days from 
the date of the NOOH's publication in the Federal Register.<BR>During that grace 
period, a state is to notify providers that the<BR>affected drug will no longer 
be eligible for reimbursement under the<BR>Medicare and Medicaid programs.</P>
<P>Statutory and Regulatory Provisions for Drug Reimbursement 
under<BR>Medicaid</P>
<P>States have the option of including the costs of prescription drugs 
in<BR>their Medicaid plans.&nbsp; Section 1905(a)(10) of the Act.&nbsp; All of 
the<BR>States appealing here have elected to include the costs of 
prescription<BR>drugs in their Medicaid plans.&nbsp; Section 1903(i)(5) of the 
Act, however,<BR>denies federal funding under Medicaid for drug products which 
are not<BR>eligible for Medicare payments under section 1862(c) of the 
Act.<BR>Section 1862(c) prohibits payment for --</P>
<P>&nbsp;(1)&nbsp; a drug product --</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; (A)&nbsp;&nbsp; which is described in section 107(c)(3) of the 
Drug<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Amendments of 1962,</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
which may be dispensed only upon prescription,</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (C)&nbsp;&nbsp; for which the Secretary [of DHHS] has 
issued a<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; notice of an opportunity for a hearing . . . on 
a<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; proposed order of the Secretary to withdraw 
approval<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of an application for such drug product . . . 
because<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Secretary has determined that the drug is 
less<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than effective for all conditions of use 
prescribed,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; recommended, or suggested in its labeling, 
and</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (D)&nbsp;&nbsp; for which the Secretary has not determined 
there<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is a compelling justification for its medical 
need;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and</P>
<P>&nbsp;(2)&nbsp; any other drug product --</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (A)&nbsp;&nbsp; which is identical, related, or similar 
[IRS] .<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . . to a drug productdescribed 
in<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; paragraph (1) and</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (B)&nbsp;&nbsp; for which the Secretary has not determined 
there<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is a compelling justification for its medical need . 
.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . ..The FDA regulations describe an IRS drug 
product<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as follows:</P>
<P>&nbsp;An identical, related or similar drug includes other 
brands,<BR>&nbsp;potencies, dosage forms, salts, and esters of the same 
drug<BR>&nbsp;moiety as well as of any drug moiety related in 
chemical<BR>&nbsp;structure or known pharmacological properties.</P>
<P>21 C.F.R. . 310.6(b)(1).</P>
<P>The regulations then describe the process for identifying an IRS drug:</P>
<P>&nbsp;Where experts qualified by scientific training and experience 
to<BR>&nbsp;evaluate the safety and effectiveness of drugs would 
conclude<BR>&nbsp;that the findings and conclusions, stated in a drug 
efficacy<BR>&nbsp;notice or notice of opportunity for hearing, that a drug 
product<BR>&nbsp;is a "new drug" or that there is a lack of evidence to show 
that<BR>&nbsp;a drug product is safe or effective are applicable to 
an<BR>&nbsp;identical, related, or similar drug product, such product 
is<BR>&nbsp;affected by the notice.&nbsp; A combination drug product containing 
a<BR>&nbsp;drug that is identical, related, or similar to a drug named in 
a<BR>&nbsp;notice may also be subject to the findings and conclusions in 
a<BR>&nbsp;notice that a drug product is a "new drug" or that there is 
a<BR>&nbsp;lack of evidence to show that a drug product is safe 
or<BR>&nbsp;effective.</P>
<P>21 C.F.R. . 310.6(b)(2).</P>
<P>The regulations define a "new drug" as follows:</P>
<P>&nbsp;Any marketed drug is a "new drug" if any labeling change 
made<BR>&nbsp;after October 9, 1962, recommends or suggests new conditions 
of<BR>&nbsp;use under which the drug is not generally recognized as safe 
and<BR>&nbsp;effective by qualified experts.&nbsp; Undisclosed or unreported 
side<BR>&nbsp;effects as well as the emergence of new knowledge 
presenting<BR>&nbsp;questions with respect to the safety or effectiveness of a 
drug<BR>&nbsp;may result in its becoming a "new drug" even though it 
was<BR>&nbsp;previously considered "not a new drug . . . ."</P>
<P>21 C.F.R. . 310.100(c)..Analysis of Issues Relating to Specific 
Drug<BR>Products</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BELLERGAL</P>
<P>Bellergal and Bellergal-S are drug products manufactured by the 
Sandoz<BR>Pharmaceuticals Corporation (Sandoz).&nbsp; HCFA disallowed claims for 
the<BR>Bellergal drugs because, according to HCFA, Bellergal is IRS to two 
drug<BR>products named in a May 6, 1983 NOOH (48 Fed. Reg. 20,495) (DESI 
597),<BR>Belladenal and Donnatal. 4/&nbsp; Belladenal, a drug product also made 
by<BR>Sandoz, and Donnatal have as their primary ingredients belladonna 
and<BR>phenobarbital.&nbsp; Bellergal is composed of the following 
ingredients:<BR>belladonna, phenobarbital, and ergotamine tartrate.</P>
<P>The States argued that any disallowance for Bellergal should be 
reversed<BR>for the following reasons:</P>
<P>&nbsp;--&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it is questionable whether Bellergal 
was in fact a "new<BR>&nbsp;drug" subject to a DESI notice and subsequent IRS 
status;</P>
<P>&nbsp;--&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the presence of an additional 
ingredient, ergotamine<BR>&nbsp;tartrate, in Bellergal changes its use and 
renders it<BR>&nbsp;substantially different from the LTE drugs named in the May 
6,<BR>&nbsp;1983 NOOH; and</P>
<P>&nbsp;--&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the States could not have nor should 
have known that<BR>&nbsp;Bellergal was an IRS drug.</P>
<P>We conclude that any dispute concerning the "new drug" status of<BR>Bellergal 
did not interfere with the States' ability to identify it as<BR>an IRS, that the 
additional ingredient did not prevent Bellergal from<BR>being IRS to the drugs 
in the 1983 NOOH, and that the States should have<BR>identified Bellergal as 
IRS.</P>
<P>A.&nbsp; The "New Drug" Status of Bellergal</P>
<P>The States contended that an ongoing dispute exists between the FDA 
and<BR>Sandoz as to whether Bellergal was subject to a NOOH, and that 
this<BR>dispute impeded their efforts to identify Bellergal as IRS.&nbsp; 
Sandoz<BR>began marketing Bellergal in 1934.&nbsp; Sandoz took the position 
that<BR>Bellergal was exempt from the DESI provisions under.the 
"grandfather"<BR>clause of the FFDCA.&nbsp; Sandoz maintained that Bellergal was 
subject to<BR>the Food and Drug Act of 1906 and therefore, under the 
FFDCA's<BR>"grandfather" clause, was not a "new drug" since the labeling 
for<BR>Bellergal contained the same representations as to conditions for use 
as<BR>it did under the 1906 Act.&nbsp; Sandoz accordingly never submitted a NDA 
for<BR>Bellergal under the FFDCA.&nbsp; Sandoz concluded that Bellergal, 
being<BR>exempt from the "new drug" category, cannot be considered IRS within 
the<BR>meaning of 21 C.F.R. . 310.6, and that accordingly Bellergal was 
not<BR>covered by any NOOH as part of the DESI review process.&nbsp; Illinois 
Ex. 3.</P>
<P>We find the States' argument concerning the effect of the legal 
dispute<BR>between the FDA and Sandoz unpersuasive.&nbsp; There is no evidence 
that the<BR>States were paralyzed by the Sandoz-FDA dispute over the status 
of<BR>Bellergal, or indeed, that they were even aware of it, during the 
time<BR>period covered by these disallowances (1984 through 1988 for 
States<BR>disputing Bellergal disallowances).&nbsp; The earliest indication we 
have<BR>from the record before us that the States knew of the controversy 
over<BR>Bellergal was a March 31, 1989 letter from Sandoz to Illinois, 
detailing<BR>Sandoz's discussions with the FDA, which was apparently written 
in<BR>response to Illinois' inquiries after receipt of the audit results.&nbsp; 
Id.<BR>Thus, the States' argument that the Sandoz-FDA dispute justified 
their<BR>delays regarding Bellergal is patently untenable.</P>
<P>Furthermore, while this Board is not the proper forum to resolve 
any<BR>conflict between Sandoz and the FDA over Bellergal, we note that 
the<BR>record before us suggests that this dispute was, in fact, resolved 
since<BR>Sandoz failed to challenge a 1983 FDA finding that Bellergal does 
not<BR>qualify for the "grandfather" exemption. 5/.B.&nbsp; The Effect of 
an<BR>Additional Ingredient in Bellergal</P>
<P>The States also argued that, even if Bellergal is subject to the NDA 
and<BR>DESI process, the presence of an additional ingredient, 
ergotamine<BR>tartrate, removes Bellergal from the ambit of the 1983 NOOH.&nbsp; 
The 1983<BR>NOOH concerned a review of certain drugs containing an 
anticholinergic<BR>in fixed combination with a barbiturate, which were 
classified as<BR>lacking substantial evidence of effectiveness for 
various<BR>gastrointestinal disorders.&nbsp; Among the 
anticholinergic/barbiturate<BR>combination drug products listed in the NOOH were 
Donnatal and<BR>Belladenal, whose primary ingredients are belladonna and 
phenobarbital.</P>
<P>The States argued that the different combination of ingredients 
in<BR>Bellergal radically changes its use and renders it 
substantially<BR>different from Donnatal and Belladenal, since the addition of 
ergotamine<BR>tartrate gives Bellergal a wider range of uses than 
Donnatal.&nbsp; While<BR>conceding that the ingredient with the greatest volume, 
phenobarbital,<BR>is the same in both the LTE drugs and Bellergal, the States 
contended<BR>that the critical factor in determining a drug's effectiveness is 
the<BR>labeled indications of usage.&nbsp; The States referred to the 
Physicians'<BR>Desk Reference, wherein the labeled uses of Donnatal and 
Belladenal<BR>relate only to the gastrointestinal system, while Bellergal is 
shown as<BR>therapeutic in the endocrine and cardiovascular systems, as well as 
in<BR>the gastrointestinal system..Being composed of three 
ingredients,<BR>Bellergal is considered a combination drug product.&nbsp; 
Concerning<BR>combination drugs, the regulations provide:</P>
<P>&nbsp;Two or more drugs may be combined in a single dosage form 
when<BR>&nbsp;each component makes a contribution to the claimed effects 
and<BR>&nbsp;the dosage of each component . . . is such that the 
combination<BR>&nbsp; is safe and effective . . . .</P>
<P>21 C.F.R. . 300.50(a) (emphasis added).</P>
<P>The regulations further provide:</P>
<P>&nbsp;A combination drug product containing a drug that is 
identical,<BR>&nbsp;related or similar to a drug named in a notice may also 
be<BR>&nbsp;subject to the findings and conclusions in a notice that a 
drug<BR>&nbsp;product is a "new drug" or that there is a lack of evidence 
to<BR>&nbsp;show that a drug product is safe or effective.</P>
<P>21 C.F.R. . 310.6(b)(2).&nbsp; Thus, a combination drug product may also 
be<BR>ineffective when the drug product is made up of two or more 
ingredients,<BR>where one or more of these ingredients is the subject of a NOOH 
and is<BR>the basis for finding the drug ineffective.</P>
<P>In order for a drug product to be considered an IRS drug, therefore, 
its<BR>ingredients do not have to coincide exactly with those of a LTE 
drug.<BR>If the ingredients were exactly the same, then the suspect drug would 
be<BR>"identical" to the LTE drug.&nbsp; It is sufficient, however, to confer 
IRS<BR>status on a drug product if that drug is "related or similar" to the 
LTE<BR>drug.&nbsp; Here, of the three ingredients present in Bellergal, two of 
them<BR>in combination, belladonna and phenobarbital, were classified as LTE 
in<BR>the 1983 NOOH.&nbsp; It is difficult to see how any drug would qualify 
as<BR>"similar" if the addition of a small amount of one other 
ingredient<BR>could be presumed to overcome the substantial identity of all the 
other<BR>ingredients.&nbsp; The States have not shown any reason why they could 
not<BR>identify Bellergal as IRS by tracing the two matching ingredients.&nbsp; 
Nor<BR>have the States provided any evidence that their experts determined 
that<BR>the belladonna/phenobarbital combination somehow contributes to 
the<BR>effectiveness of ergotamine tartrate, as each ingredient in 
a<BR>combination drug must. 6/.The regulations are explicit that 
"each<BR>component" of a combination drug must make a contribution to the 
drug's<BR>effectiveness.&nbsp; 21 C.F.R. . 300.50(a).&nbsp; The Court of Appeals 
for the<BR>Third Circuit has held that "a product with an additional 
active<BR>ingredient must be more effective for its intended purposes than 
that<BR>product would be without the extra ingredient."&nbsp; United States v. 
225<BR>Cartons, More or Less, of an Article or Drug, 871 F.2d 409, 416 
(3rd<BR>Cir. 1989).</P>
<P>It is not sufficient for the States to point to additional indications<BR>for 
which Bellergal is labeled, beyond those for which the NOOH found<BR>belladonna 
and phenobarbital to be ineffective.&nbsp; While a drug must be<BR>found 
ineffective for all its labeled indications to be LTE, a drug<BR>which is 
related or similar to an ineffective drug is not reimbursable<BR>unless a 
compelling medical need has been shown.&nbsp; No such compelling<BR>need has 
been alleged here, and none is likely to exist, even if we were<BR>to address 
the issue, since ergotamine tartrate is approved in other<BR>forms.&nbsp; 
Accordingly, we find that Bellergal is IRS to the LTE drugs<BR>listed in the 
1983 NOOH.</P>
<P>C.&nbsp; Notice of Bellergal's Status as an IRS Drug</P>
<P>The States' final argument concerning the Bellergal drugs was that<BR>HCFA's 
imposition of a disallowance amounted to a retroactive sanction.<BR>Citing 
Louisiana, the States contended that they could not have known<BR>that Bellergal 
was IRS until they received the audit findings.&nbsp; The<BR>States argued that 
a reference to drug compendia after the 1983 NOOH<BR>would have shown only the 
different usages for the drugs.&nbsp; The States<BR>asserted, moreover, that 
their experts concluded that Bellergal was not<BR>an IRS drug. 7/</P>
<P>The Board held in Louisiana that a state should not be subject 
to<BR>disallowances for IRS drugs for the period of time between 
publication<BR>of the Federal Register notice and the point when the state knew 
or<BR>should have known that the drugs were IRS.&nbsp; Louisiana at 3.&nbsp; 
Applying<BR>this criteria to the facts of these appeals, we find that the 
States<BR>reasonably should have determined from the 1983.NOOH that Bellergal 
was<BR>IRS to the LTE drugs listed there.&nbsp; The near-identity of 
Bellergal's<BR>ingredients to those of the LTE drugs could have been ascertained 
from<BR>drug compendia, not merely the existence of additional indications 
for<BR>Bellergal.&nbsp; In the Physicians' Desk Reference (44th Ed., 1990) 
(PDR),<BR>Bellergal is indexed, along with Donnatal and Belladenal, under 
the<BR>active ingredient phenobarbital.&nbsp; PDR at 322.&nbsp; The descriptions 
show<BR>that Belladenal consists of alkaloids of belladonna (.25 mg) 
and<BR>phenobarbital (50 mg), while Bellergal-S consists of alkaloids 
of<BR>belladonna (.2 mg), phenobarbital (40 mg), and ergotamine tartrate 
(.6<BR>mg).&nbsp; Compare PDR at 1931 with PDR at 1932.</P>
<P>Unlike the situation with Naldecon, discussed below, we have no 
evidence<BR>that the States' pharmacists actually made prospective 
determinations<BR>that Bellergal was not IRS in their professional judgment, 
that the<BR>States were in widespread agreement about such a conclusion, or that 
any<BR>efforts were made to contact FDA or HCFA for guidance about 
Bellergal<BR>specifically if the State experts found the determination difficult 
to<BR>reach.&nbsp; Furthermore, even before us, the States have not developed 
any<BR>persuasive explanation of why Bellergal would not be considered IRS 
to<BR>Belladenal and Donnatal, given the strong similarity of 
ingredients.<BR>Under the reasonableness standard set forth in Louisiana, the 
States<BR>have not shown that it was unreasonable to expect them to 
have<BR>identified Bellergal as IRS from an examination of national 
drug<BR>compendia.</P>
<P>Accordingly, we find that the Bellergal drugs were IRS drugs, and 
we<BR>sustain HCFA's disallowance of claims for FFP for the Bellergal drugs.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DIPYRIDAMOLE</P>
<P>Dipyridamole is a generic drug product manufactured by a number 
of<BR>pharmaceutical companies and identical to a brand name product 
marketed<BR>under the name Persantine.&nbsp; During the period at issue, a 
NOOH<BR>classified dipyridamole as less-than-effective for its only 
labeled<BR>indication.&nbsp; Before issuing the NOOH, however, the FDA approved 
a<BR>supplement to Persantine's NDA, finding it effective for a 
new<BR>indication, which its manufacturer was permitted to substitute on 
its<BR>label.&nbsp; Because of a law providing for a three-year 
marketing<BR>exclusivity, the manufacturers of the generic products were 
not<BR>permitted to amend their labeling to show the new effective 
indication<BR>until the exclusivity period expired.&nbsp; Since the LTE status 
of a drug is<BR>weighed in relation to its labeled indications, the generics 
were<BR>classified LTE in the interim..HCFA argued that the issuance of a 
NOOH<BR>relating to dipyridamole automatically triggered termination of 
payment,<BR>and no other facts should be considered relevant.&nbsp; The States 
contended<BR>that retroactive reimbursement for dipyridamole was guaranteed 
by<BR>language in the preamble to HCFA's regulations asserting that 
Medicaid<BR>would retroactively reimburse for any drug for which a NOOH was 
issued<BR>but which was later determined to be effective.&nbsp; In any case, the 
States<BR>argued that, because of the unique situation presented here, the 
Act<BR>could not have intended to cut funding for a product already 
found<BR>effective, simply because another law (for purposes unrelated 
to<BR>Medicaid) prevented the effective use from being added to the 
labeling.</P>
<P>We conclude that dipyridamole is eligible for retroactive 
Medicaid<BR>reimbursement, and the disallowances for generic dipyridamole 
are<BR>consequently reversed.&nbsp; The States' challenge to the 
automatic<BR>triggering of non-payment by the NOOH in the case of dipyridamole 
is,<BR>thus, moot.</P>
<P>A.&nbsp; The Regulatory History of Dipyridamole</P>
<P>The history of FDA actions relating to dipyridamole is 
relatively<BR>complex.&nbsp; In 1971 the FDA classified the generic drug 
product<BR>dipyridamole, including a brand name version known as Persantine, 
as<BR>possibly effective for long-term therapy of chronic angina pectoris.&nbsp; 
36<BR>Fed. Reg. 3,078 (Feb. 17, 1971).&nbsp; Later, in 1972, the FDA 
exempted<BR>coronary vasodilators (anti-anginal drugs), including 
products<BR>containing dipyridamole, from the time limits established for 
completing<BR>the DESI program.&nbsp; 37 Fed. Reg. 26,623 (Dec. 14, 1972).&nbsp; 
This exemption<BR>allowed 81 dipyridamole drug products to remain on the market 
while<BR>studies were conducted to determine their effectiveness.&nbsp; FDA 
granted<BR>the exemption because of the medical need for, and absence of, 
effective<BR>drugs for treatment and prevention of anginal attacks.&nbsp; All of 
these<BR>dipyridamole drug products had only one labeled indication, 
for<BR>long-term therapy of chronic angina pectoris.</P>
<P>In 1977 the FDA amended the exemption by announcing guidelines and<BR>methods 
for evaluating the bioavailability and effectiveness of 
coronary<BR>vasodilators, and describing conditions under which the drug 
products<BR>could be marketed while the studies were in progress.&nbsp; 42 Fed. 
Reg.<BR>43,127 (August 26, 1977).&nbsp; On February 17, 1978, the FDA announced 
that,<BR>in the interest of minimizing duplicate and costly clinical testing 
of<BR>essentially the same drug product, each manufacturer need not 
clinically<BR>test its own product for effectiveness as long as at.least one 
other<BR>manufacturer conducted appropriate tests on a product containing 
the<BR>same chemical entity in a similar dosage form.&nbsp; 43 Fed. Reg. 
7,044.&nbsp; The<BR>FDA later announced that this new policy was implemented 
specifically<BR>with regard to single-entity coronary vasodilators.&nbsp; 43 
Fed. Reg. 41,282<BR>(September 15, 1978).</P>
<P>In September 1981, Boehringer Ingelheim (Boehringer), the manufacturer<BR>of 
Persantine, submitted to the FDA the results of four clinical 
studies<BR>intended to demonstrate the effectiveness of Persantine in the 
long-term<BR>therapy of chronic angina pectoris.&nbsp; On January 15, 1987, the 
FDA issued<BR>a NOOH which reclassified dipyridamole as "lacking substantial 
evidence<BR>of effectiveness" for long term therapy of chronic angina 
pectoris,<BR>proposed to withdraw NDAs for the labeled indication of angina, 
offered<BR>an opportunity for a hearing on the proposal, and revoked the 
temporary<BR>exemption that had allowed drug products containing dipyridamole 
to<BR>remain on the market.&nbsp; 52 Fed. Reg. 1,663.&nbsp; FDA found that the 
four<BR>studies submitted by Boehringer did not "constitute substantial 
evidence<BR>that Persantine is effective for long term therapy of chronic 
angina<BR>pectoris."&nbsp; Id. at 1,667. 8/</P>
<P>Although not mentioned in the January 15, 1987 NOOH, approximately a<BR>month 
earlier (on December 22, 1986) the FDA had approved a supplement<BR>to 
Boehringer's NDA for Persantine.&nbsp; The supplement approved was for a<BR>new 
labeled indication "as an adjunct to coumarin anticoagulants in 
the<BR>prevention of postoperative thromboembolic complications of 
cardiac<BR>valve replacements."&nbsp; HCFA Ex. 31.&nbsp; The FDA concluded that 
"adequate<BR>information has been presented to demonstrate.that the drug product 
is<BR>safe and effective for use as recommended" in the new labeling.&nbsp; 
Id.<BR>The approved labeling for Persantine contained the new indication 
only.<BR>Boehringer received a three-year marketing exclusivity for 
Persantine<BR>for the new labeled indication under the Drug Price Competition 
and<BR>Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, Public Law 98-417, which amended 
21<BR>U.S.C. . 355.&nbsp; See 53 Fed. Reg. 12,605 (April 17, 1987).&nbsp; During 
these<BR>three years, no other manufacturer could receive approval to label 
its<BR>drug product for the new indication.&nbsp; The net effect of the 
FDA's<BR>actions was to inform the public that dipyridamole was ineffective 
for<BR>one use, effective for another, and subject to a delay in correcting 
the<BR>generics' labeling to reflect that reality.&nbsp; In the meantime, 
generic<BR>dipyridamole products remained on the market.</P>
<P>After the expiration of the three-year period, other manufacturers 
of<BR>dipyridamole products submitted, and received approval from the FDA 
for,<BR>supplements to their abbreviated NDAs to reflect the new 
labeled<BR>indications.&nbsp; See HCFA Exs. 25 through 29.&nbsp; In the interim, 
HCFA<BR>approved claims of FFP for Persantine, but denied FFP for all 
other<BR>claims for dipyridamole submitted by the States, even though they 
were<BR>identical and bioequivalent to Persantine. 9/&nbsp; However, 
HCFA<BR>acknowledged that the other products are now eligible for FFP 
upon<BR>obtaining approval to substitute the new indication on their 
labels.<BR>HCFA Br. at 58-69.</P>
<P>B.&nbsp; Retroactive Reimbursement for Dipyridamole</P>
<P>Since dipyridamole has ultimately been proven effective for a 
new<BR>indication which has been substituted for the prior labeled 
indication,<BR>and is now reimbursable, the commitment made by HCFA to reimburse 
DESI<BR>drugs later found effective appears applicable.&nbsp; In the preamble 
to.the<BR>Federal Register notice promulgating 42 C.F.R. . 441.25, codifying 
the<BR>prohibition of Medicaid payments for ineffective drugs, HCFA stated:</P>
<P>&nbsp;If any drug that is the subject of a NOOH is subsequently 
proven<BR>&nbsp;to be effective, the Federal government will reimburse 
under<BR>&nbsp;Medicare Part B and Medicaid claims that were denied during 
the<BR>&nbsp;period the NOOH was in effect because the drug was 
determined<BR>&nbsp;less than effective.</P>
<P>46 Fed. Reg. 48,550 at 48,551-52 (October 1, 1981).&nbsp; Further, the 
House<BR>report on the bill adding the restrictions on LTE drugs to the 
Medicaid<BR>Act anticipated that, if a drug is contained in a NOOH based on 
the<BR>Secretary's determination that it is "less than effective for 
all<BR>conditions of use," but is "subsequently proven to be effective, 
then<BR>reimbursement would be allowed."&nbsp; H.R. Rep. No. 158, 97th Cong., 
1st<BR>Sess. 345.&nbsp; These statements would appear to guarantee 
retroactive<BR>reimbursement for dipyridamole, since it was "proven to be 
effective"<BR>and had claims denied during a period when a NOOH was "in 
effect."</P>
<P>HCFA argued that retroactive reimbursement is nevertheless 
unavailable,<BR>because the preamble language was intended to be limited to 
situations<BR>where the NOOH is determined to be in error.&nbsp; HCFA Br. 
59-60.&nbsp; The plain<BR>language of the preamble is not so limited.&nbsp; 
Neither the preamble nor<BR>the legislative history limited the intended 
retroactive funding to<BR>drugs whose original indications were 
vindicated.&nbsp; A NOOH is a proposed<BR>action of the Secretary to withdraw 
approval for a drug because of a<BR>determination that it is LTE for all 
"conditions of use . . . in its<BR>labeling."&nbsp; The DESI process of which 
the NOOH was one stage cannot be<BR>said to be limited only to consideration of 
the initially-sponsored<BR>indications.&nbsp; The final actions which ultimately 
flow from a NOOH may<BR>include withdrawal of the drug from the market, hearings 
on or<BR>investigations of the effectiveness of the drug with a 
determination<BR>that some or all conditions of use on the label are effective, 
or, as<BR>here, altered labeling to reflect effective conditions of use. 
10/&nbsp; HCFA<BR>did not.deny that once the challenge to the effectiveness of 
the<BR>dipyridamole drugs was resolved by the substitution of revised 
labeling<BR>reflecting their effective use, they became eligible for FFP.&nbsp; 
HCFA Br.<BR>at 58-59.</P>
<P>Dipyridamole was the subject of a NOOH which was in effect during 
the<BR>period for which claims were denied.&nbsp; During the DESI process of 
which<BR>the NOOH was a part, the FDA withdrew approval of some of the 
products<BR>when their manufacturers did not choose to seek hearings, while 
others<BR>remained on the market with pending hearing requests. 11/&nbsp; 52 
Fed. Reg.<BR>11,753 (April 10, 1987).&nbsp; The.products listed in the 
withdrawal notice<BR>included Persantine, but the notice specified that it 
applied to the<BR>applications only "insofar as they pertain to the original 
indication."<BR>At least one manufacturer, and probably others, withdrew its 
pending<BR>hearing request only when it was able to substitute the new 
labeling<BR>indication, as a result of supplementing its original 
application.&nbsp; The<BR>NOOH process thus may fairly be said to have ended 
only with the<BR>approval of the supplemented applications.&nbsp; The NOOH may 
not have been<BR>proven wrong, but it is plainly no longer "in effect," since 
many of the<BR>generics (and presumably all of them ultimately) are approved for 
a<BR>labeled indication.&nbsp; Therefore, the Secretary has manifestly 
not<BR>"determined that the drug is less than effective for all conditions 
of<BR>use prescribed, recommended or suggested in its labeling" now that 
the<BR>labels are revised to show an effective use.</P>
<P>Nothing in our decision limits HCFA's ability prospectively to 
restrict<BR>its commitment to situations where the outcome for a drug subject to 
a<BR>NOOH is the vindication of at least one of the labeled 
indications<BR>originally listed in the NOOH, provided that notice of the policy 
is<BR>given to the States.&nbsp; However, it would be unfair to impose such 
a<BR>restriction on the States in this case when it was not articulated 
by<BR>HCFA in either the regulation or the preamble.</P>
<P>We note that the approval of new labeling for dipyridamole occurred 
in<BR>essence as a part of the DESI review process for the drug.&nbsp; 
The<BR>dipyridamole drugs involved here continued to be available on the 
market<BR>throughout the period, the new indication was known to be effective 
even<BR>before the NOOH was issued, and the same DESI process 
ultimately<BR>resulted in their approval.&nbsp; We might reach a different 
conclusion if,<BR>long after the DESI process has been completed and a drug 
withdrawn from<BR>the market, some new use were found.&nbsp; Medicaid could not 
be held<BR>responsible to fund a drug retroactively when no effective use was 
known<BR>at the time, simply because some later research uncovered one (and 
such<BR>situations should be rare, since an ineffective drug would normally 
be<BR>withdrawn from the market within a reasonable period of time).&nbsp; But 
in<BR>this case there is no reason to conclude that the drug was being 
used<BR>for ineffective purposes,.since the effective use was known 
throughout<BR>the period the NOOH was in effect.&nbsp; We conclude that, under 
these<BR>circumstances, HCFA's commitment to reimburse retroactively for 
drugs<BR>later proven to be effective should be carried out in the case 
of<BR>generic dipyridamole.</P>
<P>We see no reason why Medicaid should be denied the benefits of lower<BR>price 
generic drugs, which continued to be marketed legally absent FDA<BR>withdrawal 
action, by denying retroactive reimbursement for their use.<BR>The medical 
community was informed by the approval of Persantine's<BR>labeling, with the 
explicit FDA ruling that it was bioequivalent, that<BR>an effective use existed, 
and that equivalent generics were available.<BR>12/&nbsp; An examination of the 
PDR, for example, would have informed any<BR>physician that Persantine was 
dipyridamole and was indicated for the new<BR>usage in cardiac valve replacement 
(at 691) and that a number of<BR>manufacturers produced generic dipyridamole (at 
310).&nbsp; A responsible<BR>physician or pharmacist might well permit generic 
substitution in light<BR>of the enormous price differential.&nbsp; Under HCFA's 
interpretation, any<BR>patient or third-party payor could benefit from such cost 
savings except<BR>the ones that perhaps most need to, Medicaid and Medicare.</P>
<P>Our conclusion serves the purpose of permitting Medicaid and 
Medicare<BR>patients to benefit from an effective drug.at the most economical 
cost,<BR>which is clearly in accord with the purposes of the Act.&nbsp; See, 
e.g.,<BR>Section 1902(a)(30)(A) of the Act; 42 C.F.R. .. 
447.331-447.333.<BR>Unquestionably, the savings involved are substantial. 
13/&nbsp; One State put<BR>the monthly cost of a prescription for Persantine (25 
milligrams) per<BR>patient at $14.85, the cost of the generic dipyridamole at 
$1.26.<BR>Oregon Ex. 7.C.&nbsp; Assuming a FFP rate of 50 percent, one 
monthly<BR>prescription of Persantine would cost both the federal government and 
a<BR>state $7.42 each, while for generic dipyridamole the cost would 
be<BR>$0.63, about one-twelfth the price of Persantine. 14/</P>
<P>We thus conclude that claims for dipyridamole are eligible for<BR>retroactive 
reimbursement.&nbsp; In light of this conclusion, we need not<BR>address the 
States' arguments that dipyridamole was not LTE for all<BR>indications, despite 
issuance of a NOOH, or that Medicaid reimbursement<BR>should have been 
permitted, even if it was LTE, because of compelling<BR>medical justifications.

NALDECON</P>
<P>Naldecon and Naldecon-related drugs (Naldecon drugs) are combination<BR>drug 
products. 16/&nbsp; HCFA disallowed claims for the Naldecon drugs<BR>because, 
according to HCFA, the Naldecon drugs are "identical, related,<BR>or similar" to 
Dimetapp Elixir and Dimetapp Extentabs (Dimetapp) found<BR>to be LTE in a 
December 23, 1983 NOOH.&nbsp; 48 Fed. Reg. 56,854 (DESI<BR>11935).&nbsp; The 
States argued that it was unreasonable to expect them to<BR>identify these drugs 
as IRS to Dimetapp based not on the specific<BR>ingredients they contain but 
only on the fact that they each contain<BR>more than one decongestant or more 
than one antihistamine, since the<BR>NOOH did not make clear that this was the 
reason that Dimetapp was LTE.<BR>We conclude that the States were not given 
sufficient information to<BR>have identified the Naldecon drugs as IRS.</P>
<P>A. The Regulatory History Relating to Naldecon</P>
<P>The history behind the FDA's determination that Dimetapp was a LTE 
drug<BR>product is as follows.&nbsp; In 1972 the FDA found that Dimetapp 
Extentabs<BR>was possibly effective, but that Dimetapp Elixir in oral dosage 
form<BR>lacked substantial evidence of effectiveness as a fixed combination 
drug<BR>product.&nbsp; 37 Fed. Reg. 15,022 (July 27, 1972).&nbsp; In April 1973 
the FDA<BR>issued a NOOH proposing to withdraw approval of a NDA for 
Dimetapp<BR>Extentabs as lacking substantial evidence of effectiveness since no 
data<BR>was submitted pursuant to the July 1972 notice.&nbsp; 38 Fed. Reg. 
10,168<BR>(April 25, 1973).&nbsp; The FDA invited any interested party with an 
IRS drug<BR>product, not the subject of an approved NDA, to respond to the NOOH 
and<BR>participate in a hearing.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; Any person who wished to 
determine<BR>whether a specific product was covered by the NOOH was advised to 
write<BR>to the FDA.&nbsp; Id.</P>
<P>On December 14, 1973, however, the FDA granted a temporary exemption 
for<BR>certain prescription oral drugs.offered for relief of cough, 
cold,<BR>allergy, and related symptoms.&nbsp; The exemption was granted because 
of the<BR>similarity between prescription drugs for these uses and over 
the<BR>counter (OTC) drugs for the same indications which were subject to 
an<BR>ongoing OTC drug review program.&nbsp; 38 Fed. Reg. 34,481-82.&nbsp; As a 
result,<BR>the sustained release version of Dimetapp was exempted from the 
April<BR>25, 1973 NOOH for an indeterminate amount of time.&nbsp; 
Gerstenzang<BR>Declaration, HCFA Ex. 1, . 35.</P>
<P>On September 9, 1976, the FDA published an advance notice of 
proposed<BR>rulemaking to establish a monograph by the Advisory Review Panel on 
OTC<BR>Cold, Cough, Allergy, Bronchodilator and Antiasthmatic Products.&nbsp; 
41<BR>Fed. Reg. 38,312.&nbsp; In this monograph the FDA proposed to 
establish<BR>conditions under which OTC cold, cough, allergy, bronchodilator 
and<BR>antiasthmatic drugs are generally recognized as safe and effective 
and<BR>not misbranded.</P>
<P>In the December 23, 1983 NOOH, the FDA announced that it was revoking<BR>the 
exemptions for Dimetapp Extentabs and Elixir and stated the<BR>conditions for 
the manufacturer of Dimetapp to market the Dimetapp<BR>products in a 
reformulated version.&nbsp; The formulation of Dimetapp ruled<BR>LTE consisted 
of the following ingredients:&nbsp; phenylephrine hydrochloride<BR>(a 
decongestant), phenypropanolamine hydrochloride (a decongestant), 
and<BR>brompheniramine maleate (an antihistamine).</P>
<P>The FDA explained:</P>
<P>&nbsp;Brompheniramine maleate and phenylpropanolamine 
hydrochloride<BR>&nbsp;were both considered to be safe and effective by the OTC 
review<BR>&nbsp;panel . . . .&nbsp; The OTC drug review panel&nbsp; . . . also 
concluded<BR>&nbsp;that combinations containing a nasal decongestant and 
an<BR>&nbsp;antihistamine, as in reformulated Dimetapp Extentabs and 
Elixir,<BR>&nbsp;are safe and effective (41 FR 38326).</P>
<P>48 Fed. Reg. 56,854 (December 23, 1983).&nbsp; The Federal Register 
reference<BR>is to a page from the proposed monograph which sets various 
criteria for<BR>Category I (effective) and Category II (ineffective) combination 
drug<BR>products.&nbsp; Among the combinations of ingredients classified as 
Category<BR>I are combinations containing an antihistamine and a nasal 
decongestant.<BR>The FDA later approved a reformulated version of Dimetapp 
conforming to<BR>Category I and containing one decongestant, 
phenylpropanolamine<BR>hydrochloride, and one antihistamine, brompheniramine 
maleate.&nbsp; Id..On<BR>July 19, 1985, the FDA withdrew marketing approval of 
the original<BR>three-ingredient formulation of Dimetapp Elixir and Extentabs as 
lacking<BR>substantial evidence of effectiveness, and stated:</P>
<P>&nbsp;Specifically, each of the two nasal decongestants contained 
in<BR>&nbsp;these combination products has not been shown to contribute 
to<BR>&nbsp;the effectiveness of the products.&nbsp; Reformulations of 
the<BR>&nbsp;products have been approved as safe and effective.</P>
<P>50 Fed. Reg. 29,484.</P>
<P>Naldecon is composed of the following ingredients:&nbsp; two 
decongestants,<BR>phenylephrine hydrochloride and phenylpropanolamine 
hydrochloride; and<BR>two antihistamines, chlorpheniramine maleate and&nbsp; 
phenyltoloxamine<BR>citrate.&nbsp; Thus, Naldecon has among its ingredients the 
two decongestants<BR>in combination that were in the formulation of Dimetapp 
found<BR>ineffective.</P>
<P>In the September 1989 revision to the State Medicaid Manual, HCFA for<BR>the 
first time published a list, described as not all-inclusive, of IRS<BR>drug 
products.&nbsp; The Naldecon products appear on this list.&nbsp; 
Section<BR>4370.1, Addendum D at D-2.</P>
<P>B. The States' Ability to Identify Naldecon as IRS</P>
<P>HCFA argued that, while Naldecon is not "identical" to Dimetapp, 
it<BR>nevertheless is "related" or "similar" to Dimetapp in that Dimetapp 
and<BR>Naldecon share "known pharmacological properties" as set forth in 
21<BR>C.F.R. . 310.6(b)(1) because they both contain two decongestants.&nbsp; 
HCFA<BR>contended that, if the States had been monitoring the Federal 
Register<BR>properly, they would have been alerted to the fact that the 
FDA<BR>considered any two decongestants in combination ineffective in a 
drug<BR>product.&nbsp; HCFA argued that, under the criteria set forth by the 
Board in<BR>Louisiana, the States could have then easily identified Naldecon as 
an<BR>IRS drug product by consulting such compendia as Facts and 
Comparisons<BR>or the Physicians' Desk Reference, where the ingredients for the 
drug<BR>products are listed.&nbsp; HCFA acknowledged that the States could not 
have<BR>identified which drug products were IRS to Dimetapp merely 
by<BR>pinpointing one or two of its specific ingredients and eliminating 
every<BR>cold remedy listed in the compendia references which contained 
those<BR>ingredients.&nbsp; HCFA Master Br. at 48.&nbsp; Nevertheless, HCFA 
insisted, the<BR>States' experts could have readily identified Naldecon as IRS 
to<BR>Dimetapp, by recognizing the basis of the LTE finding in the 
Federal<BR>Register.notices as the presence of any two decongestants and 
then<BR>consulting the compendia.</P>
<P>We do not share HCFA's view that the FDA's notices in the Federal<BR>Register 
were so unambiguous that the States should readily have been<BR>able to 
determine the basis for the FDA's finding that Dimetapp was<BR>ineffective and 
to extrapolate that finding through compendia to arrive<BR>at the conclusion 
that Naldecon was an IRS drug product.&nbsp; We find<BR>nothing in the wording 
of the December 23, 1983 NOOH that would, as HCFA<BR>contends, lead necessarily 
to the conclusion that the presence of more<BR>than one decongestant in a drug 
product makes that drug product LTE.<BR>The NOOH stated that the 
three-ingredient formulations of Dimetapp were<BR>ineffective.&nbsp; The NOOH 
stated that no clinical studies were submitted in<BR>support of the 
products.&nbsp; No further explanation was given.</P>
<P>The NOOH then stated that brompheniramine maleate and<BR>phenylpropanolamine 
hydrochloride were considered safe and effective by<BR>the OTC drug review 
panel, and that the OTC panel concluded that<BR>combinations containing a nasal 
decongestant and an antihistamine in the<BR>reformulated Dimetapp products were 
safe and effective.&nbsp; This latter<BR>finding contained a reference to the 
1976 proposed monograph.&nbsp; This,<BR>according to HCFA, was adequate notice 
to the States that the<BR>combination of two decongestants in a drug product 
makes that product<BR>LTE. 17/</P>
<P>HCFA's position that the reference in the NOOH to the monograph would<BR>have 
explained the basis for the FDA's finding that Dimetapp was<BR>ineffective is 
not persuasive for several reasons.&nbsp; The monograph<BR>referred to in the 
.NOOH was an advance notice of proposed rulemaking.<BR>18/&nbsp; The stated 
intent of that notice was "to stimulate discussion,<BR>evaluation, and comment . 
. . . before any decision is made on the<BR>recommendations of the Panel."&nbsp; 
41 Fed. Reg. 38,312.&nbsp; The notice also<BR>proposed that the conditions in 
the monograph for Category I drugs (safe<BR>and effective) and Category II drugs 
(ineffective) be effective,<BR>respectively, 30 days and six months after the 
date of the final<BR>monograph in the Federal Register. 19/&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; 
Thus, the monograph did not<BR>make any final determination regarding the 
effectiveness of OTC cold<BR>remedies.</P>
<P>Moreover, the specific page of the monograph cited in the NOOH, 41 
Fed.<BR>Reg. 38,326, declared that a Category I (effective) drug product 
may<BR>have a combination from each pharmacologic group, such as a 
combination<BR>"containing an antihistamine and a nasal decongestant."&nbsp; On 
the same<BR>page, however, a Category II (ineffective) drug product is 
classified as<BR>including "more than two active ingredients from the same 
pharmacologic<BR>group."&nbsp; (emphasis added.)&nbsp; These categories offered 
little meaningful<BR>guidance to the States for determining why the original 
version of<BR>Dimetapp was ineffective, since it arguably could have fallen 
under the<BR>effective category&nbsp; (having an antihistamine and a 
decongestant, but not<BR>more than two of either).&nbsp; Furthermore, a later 
version of the monograph<BR>abandoned any insistence that two ingredients from 
the same group are<BR>automatically ineffective. 20/.In support of its argument 
that the<BR>States should have been able to discern why Dimetapp was 
ineffective,<BR>HCFA also referred to another page of the monograph, 41 Fed. 
Reg.<BR>38,420, where FDA proposed a regulation.&nbsp; This proposed 
regulation,<BR>which was to be codified at 21 C.F.R. . 341.40(b), stated that 
any<BR>single antihistamine active ingredient could be combined with any 
single<BR>oral nasal decongestant active ingredient.&nbsp; It is not clear that 
this<BR>language also meant that no drug could, like Naldecon, contain 
two<BR>ingredients from one of those categories.&nbsp; Even if the language 
were<BR>clearer, the States cannot fairly be considered to have been put 
on<BR>notice of the FDA's interpretation by a proposed regulation which 
never<BR>has been promulgated in final form.&nbsp; Proposed regulations are, 
by<BR>definition, subject to revision or even abandonment by an agency, so 
the<BR>public cannot be expected to rely on them.&nbsp; See, e.g., Powell v. 
Andrus,<BR>631 F.2d 699, 702, n. 2 (10th Cir. 1980); Joyce Faye Hughey, DAB 
No.<BR>1221, at 5-6, 8-9 (1991).</P>
<P>HCFA's position regarding Naldecon might thus be summarized as 
follows:<BR>the States should have recognized Naldecon as IRS based on a NOOH 
that<BR>did not contain any explanation for the action taken on Dimetapp, 
but<BR>did refer to one page of a seven-year old, 122-page proposed 
monograph<BR>that contained contradictory information, accompanied by a 
proposed<BR>regulation that, as of today,.some 16 years later, has never 
been<BR>promulgated in final form.</P>
<P>The States would bear an unreasonable burden if they are unable 
to<BR>determine from the explanation in the NOOH itself the basis on which 
to<BR>classify drug products as IRS to the products found to be 
ineffective.<BR>If the States are to meet their responsibility to identify IRS 
drug<BR>products, they must be given the necessary information to carry out 
that<BR>task.&nbsp; That was not done in the case of Dimetapp and, 
consequently,<BR>Naldecon. 21/</P>
<P>HCFA's position is further undermined by the fact that only a small<BR>number 
of states made the determination that Naldecon was an IRS drug<BR>product.&nbsp; 
The regulations provide that "experts qualified by scientific<BR>training and 
experience" are to make the determination whether a drug<BR>product is IRS to a 
LTE drug.&nbsp; 21 C.F.R. . 310.6(b)(2).&nbsp; The States<BR>contended that 
their experts had reviewed the NOOH for Dimetapp and<BR>concluded that Naldecon 
was not IRS to Dimetapp.&nbsp; A survey conducted by<BR>one State showed that of 
34 states audited by OIG, only two states, Utah<BR>and Iowa, had identified 
Naldecon as an IRS drug product.&nbsp; New Jersey<BR>Appeal File at 15-20.&nbsp; 
Another State pointed out that none of four major<BR>drug database companies had 
identified Naldecon as an IRS drug product.<BR>Indiana Appendix C at 5.&nbsp; If 
the basis for the FDA's finding in the NOOH<BR>that Dimetapp was ineffective 
were as clear as HCFA maintains it was, it<BR>is probable that more states, as 
well as the drug database companies,<BR>would have made determinations that 
Naldecon was an IRS drug product.</P>
<P>HCFA contended that if states have questions concerning a particular<BR>drug 
product, the states are encouraged to make inquiries to the FDA as<BR>to the 
applicability of a NOOH to that drug product.&nbsp; 21 C.F.R. 
.<BR>310.6(b)(3).&nbsp; HCFA pointed out that Idaho made such a request 
concerning<BR>Naldecon in July 1986, and received a response, through the 
HCFA<BR>regional office, in February.1987 that Naldecon was considered IRS 
to<BR>Dimetapp.&nbsp; HCFA Oregon Ex. 2.&nbsp; This does not, however, address 
the<BR>situation where a state has consulted its expert and that expert 
has<BR>rendered a professional opinion that the drug product is not IRS.&nbsp; 
As<BR>the States have pointed out, no HCFA or FDA rule imposes an 
obligation<BR>upon a state to verify that the FDA agrees with the opinions of 
the<BR>state's own experts.&nbsp; We also note that nothing in the record 
indicates<BR>that, after receiving the FDA's opinion that Naldecon was an IRS 
drug,<BR>the regional office disseminated that information to all the states 
in<BR>the region rather than just to Idaho.&nbsp; Further, other States 
reported<BR>they made efforts to obtain information in this regard from the FDA 
and<BR>encountered considerable difficulty.&nbsp; See, e.g., Missouri Br. at 
10;<BR>Maryland Br. at 3 and 13.</P>
<P>The Board has described the process for the identification of a drug as<BR>an 
IRS drug product:</P>
<P>&nbsp;A NOOH lists a LTE drug by its trade name, active 
ingredients,<BR>&nbsp;dosage form/route, and manufacturer.&nbsp; With this 
information a<BR>&nbsp;trained individual would consult various publications 
and<BR>&nbsp;national drug compendia . . . .&nbsp; From reference to 
these<BR>&nbsp;materials, that individual could presumably locate all IRS 
drugs<BR>&nbsp;in the marketplace.&nbsp; The most important information in 
this<BR>&nbsp;process is the active ingredients listed in the NOOH.&nbsp; As a 
HCFA<BR>&nbsp;witness testified, "[T]he burden is to follow the 
ingredients.<BR>&nbsp;If you have the ingredients, you have the key to the 
whole<BR>&nbsp;thing."</P>
<P>Louisiana at 12.</P>
<P>Here, however, HCFA conceded that the States could not have 
identified<BR>Naldecon as an IRS drug from merely the ingredients of Dimetapp 
listed<BR>in the 1983 NOOH.&nbsp; HCFA Master Br. at 48.&nbsp; The basis for the 
FDA's<BR>finding that Dimetapp was ineffective was not any of 
Dimetapp's<BR>ingredients specifically, but the fact that Dimetapp contained 
two<BR>decongestants. 22/&nbsp; The FDA, however, as we.have shown above, failed 
to<BR>articulate that basis in the NOOH. It is not enough that a drug 
is<BR>listed in compendia; the NOOH must provide ingredients, or 
other<BR>articulated criteria, by which an expert can reasonably trace its 
IRS<BR>status.&nbsp; Hence, the States' experts could not have reasonably 
determined<BR>that Naldecon was an IRS drug through the use of compendia.</P>
<P>In order for the States to have carried out their responsibilities 
with<BR>respect to Naldecon, they required adequate information beyond 
that<BR>provided in the NOOH.&nbsp; The FDA and HCFA did not provide the States 
with<BR>that information.&nbsp; Accordingly, we reverse the disallowances 
for<BR>Naldecon and Naldecon-related drug products, up to the time HCFA 
put<BR>each State on notice -- through either direct communication or 
the<BR>September 1989 revision of the State Medicaid Manual, plus 
the<BR>applicable grace period -- that those drug products were considered 
IRS<BR>drugs. 23/&nbsp; This result conforms with our holding in Louisiana that 
the<BR>States "should not be held, with the benefit of hindsight, culpable 
for<BR>not doing the virtually impossible."&nbsp; At 16.</P>
<P>Challenges to The LTE/IRS System Generally</P>
<P>The States contended that their experience with Naldecon is 
illustrative<BR>of the difficulties the States currently confront in 
implementing the<BR>DESI program.&nbsp; See discussion in the section on the 
Audit Process,<BR>infra.&nbsp; The States argued that it is fundamentally unfair 
for HCFA to<BR>require the States to make determinations on the IRS status of 
drug<BR>products, and then for HCFA to use one state's determination to bind 
all<BR>the other states.&nbsp; The responsibility for identifying IRS drugs 
should<BR>fall on the FDA, according to the States, and HCFA should then have 
an<BR>affirmative obligation to notify the States of the drug products 
which<BR>are considered to be IRS drugs.&nbsp; Until such notice is given, the 
States<BR>argued, Medicaid reimbursement should be available for drug 
products<BR>later determined to be IRS.&nbsp; The States generally blamed the 
.federal<BR>agencies for poor administration and communication.</P>
<P>One State argued that a 1990 OIG Report recommending changes in how 
HCFA<BR>and the FDA handle LTE drugs demonstrates that the federal government 
is<BR>wholly responsible for any payments for IRS drugs.&nbsp; Indiana 
Supplemental<BR>Br. at 4-8; "DHHS' Enforcement of Regulations Prohibiting 
Medicaid<BR>Payments for Less-Than-Effective Drugs," OIG/OAS Report No. 
A-03-8900220<BR>(July 13, 1990).&nbsp; We do not agree that this report in any 
way exempts<BR>the States from their responsibility during the audit periods 
for<BR>identifying IRS drugs.</P>
<P>The Board has previously heard such general attacks on the 
supposed<BR>inequities of the current DESI system and has rejected them.&nbsp; 
Whether<BR>this system is the most efficient alternative is a policy issue which 
we<BR>do not address. 24/&nbsp; The Medicaid program is a partnership between 
the<BR>federal government and the states.&nbsp; Each partner has 
responsibilities in<BR>seeing that the Medicaid program is managed in a 
responsible, safe, and<BR>effective manner, including the removal of unsafe and 
ineffective drug<BR>products.&nbsp; The Board "will not condone a dangerously 
passive approach to<BR>the problem of ineffective drugs."&nbsp; Illinois at 
8.&nbsp; The States cannot<BR>simply wait for HCFA to inform them of each LTE 
and IRS drug without<BR>risking delays which could be avoided by proactive 
efforts to .monitor<BR>the NOOHs and identify IRS drugs. 25/&nbsp; In this 
effort, good faith, as<BR>claimed by the States, is not enough.&nbsp; Effective 
actions are required.</P>
<P>Therefore, we are not reversing the disallowances for any other IRS<BR>drugs 
appealed by the States where the States did not offer arguments<BR>why they were 
unable to identify those specific drugs as IRS. 26/.One<BR>State did make a 
specific argument relating to Pediacof Syrup, which was<BR>disallowed as IRS to 
DESI Notices 6514 as well as the Dimetapp NOOH.<BR>38 Fed. Reg. 4,006 (February 
9, 1973) and 47 Fed. Reg. 22,604 (May 25,<BR>1982).&nbsp; DESI notice 6514 
expressly stated that drug combinations of<BR>antihistamines and expectorants 
are "irrational."&nbsp; 47 Fed. Reg. 22,605.<BR>The State's pharmacist did not 
contend that he had any difficulty<BR>recognizing that Pediacof Syrup contained 
a combination directly<BR>addressed in that NOOH.&nbsp; Rather, he disagreed 
with the scientific merits<BR>of the FDA conclusion in the NOOH.&nbsp; While the 
States must exercise some<BR>judgment in determining which drugs are IRS to 
those drugs covered in a<BR>NOOH, they may not disregard a NOOH because they 
disagree with it.<BR>Therefore, the disallowances relating to Pediacof Syrup are 
sustained.<BR>27/.The Audit Process</P>
<P>In addition to challenging the disallowances for specific drug 
products,<BR>some of the States also called into question the audit process used 
to<BR>arrive at the disallowances.&nbsp; Initially, the OIG began a review in 
1985<BR>of drug claims from seven states aimed at ascertaining whether they 
were<BR>effectively halting claims for FFP for LTE and IRS drugs. 28/&nbsp; 
This<BR>review resulted in disallowances, which HCFA stated are not at 
issue<BR>here, and led to a national audit.&nbsp; HCFA Master Br. at 13.&nbsp; 
Several<BR>States objected to the methodology used in the national audit.</P>
<P>HCFA submitted a declaration from the official with lead 
responsibility<BR>for the national audit review, who detailed the process 
summarized here.<BR>See Marion Declaration.&nbsp; A list of 4300 LTE and IRS 
drugs, identified by<BR>NDCs, was compiled as of August 1988 by the OIG from the 
initial review,<BR>an FDA list, and lists from four states (Pennsylvania, 
Indiana,<BR>Virginia, and Louisiana). 29/&nbsp; The list was then reviewed by 
the FDA as<BR>of July 1989 to verify that each drug was LTE or IRS based on 
a<BR>published NOOH and to cross-check the NDCs for each drug.&nbsp; The 
FDA<BR>removed over 600 drugs and the OIG eliminated 32 others due to 
problems<BR>with their NDCS, resulting in a verified list of 3583.&nbsp; This 
list was<BR>compared by computer to all drugs for which the States claimed 
FFP<BR>during the audit periods. 30/</P>
<P>The procedure then followed for each State (with three 
exceptions<BR>discussed below) began with the submission on magnetic tape of 
the<BR>State's paid claims and a determination by comparison with the 
LTE/IRS<BR>list of the amount of FFP attributable to such drugs.&nbsp; Then, a 
random<BR>sample of 200 paid LTE/IRS claims was examined manually by 
comparing<BR>them to the original copies to verify that the magnetic tape 
was<BR>accurate.&nbsp; The States were given an opportunity to comment on 
draft<BR>reports.&nbsp; Disallowance .letters were then issued reflecting 
any<BR>adjustments which were accepted based on the States' comments.</P>
<P>The three States which diverged from this audit procedure were New<BR>Jersey, 
Illinois, and Indiana.&nbsp; In New Jersey, the magnetic tape<BR>submitted by 
the State contained claims for drugs paid from State funds<BR>as well as those 
for which FFP was claimed.&nbsp; In order to determine for<BR>what percentage of 
the LTE/IRS claims FFP was claimed, the random sample<BR>of 200 claims used to 
check the accuracy of the magnetic tape was also<BR>evaluated to ascertain that 
195 were claimed for FFP and five were<BR>State-only claims.&nbsp; The 
disallowance was reduced by a projected amount<BR>to eliminate the State-only 
claims.&nbsp; In Illinois, the OIG found that the<BR>State had a master listing 
of LTE and IRS drugs, which the OIG compared<BR>to the computer list used in the 
other audits.&nbsp; This comparison showed<BR>that eight drugs which the OIG 
listed as IRS were omitted from Illinois'<BR>master listing.&nbsp; The OIG then 
used Illinois' periodic payment reports to<BR>calculate expenditures and FFP 
attributable to those eight drugs. 31/<BR>Indiana maintained periodic payment 
reports by NDCs for drugs claimed<BR>for FFP against which the OIG ran its 
computerized list and found claims<BR>for 286 LTE and IRS drugs for which the 
related FFP was disallowed. 32/</P>
<P>The audit process was complicated somewhat by the issuance of 
our<BR>Louisiana decision, after which the OIG removed from its 
computer<BR>program all NDCs not listed in the compendia or sources referenced 
in<BR>that decision, reducing the verified list to 2850, as of May 10, 
1990.<BR>The OIG reexamined the pending audits and issued final 
disallowances<BR>which did not include any amount attributable to the 733 NDCs 
removed<BR>from the list.&nbsp; However, some States already had received final 
audit<BR>reports and disallowances prior to that reexamination.&nbsp; HCFA 
agreed to<BR>have the OIG reexamine those States' disallowances and make 
any<BR>resulting reduction in the disallowances.&nbsp; HCFA Master Br. at 
15.&nbsp; HCFA<BR>should identify and notify each affected State when 
the.reexamination is<BR>completed and what if any reduction in the disallowance 
resulted. 33/<BR>If any State wishes to appeal the results of the reexamination 
on this<BR>issue only, it may do so within 30 days of receiving such notice 
from<BR>HCFA.</P>
<P>Some States argued that the random sample was used improperly 
to<BR>extrapolate the disallowances, because the auditors did not claim 
to<BR>have checked every "hard copy" claim.&nbsp; See, e.g., New York Br. at 
14-18.<BR>34/&nbsp; However, the States provided the magnetic tapes to the OIG 
as an<BR>accurate record of the claims paid, so they can hardly insist that 
the<BR>use of a sample to verify the accuracy of the tapes against the 
original<BR>claims copies maintained by the States was insufficient to permit 
HCFA<BR>to rely on the magnetic tape data.&nbsp; Despite the apparent confusion 
among<BR>some States, HCFA clearly stated that the sample was not used 
to<BR>calculate the disallowance but only to doublecheck the accuracy of 
the<BR>magnetic tape.&nbsp; Accurate recordkeeping is a responsibility of the 
States<BR>under the Act.&nbsp; See sections 1902(a)(6) and (27).&nbsp; The 
disallowance<BR>amounts were based on the computer comparison of all paid claims 
from<BR>the audit period against the OIG's list of LTE/IRS drugs, not on the 
use<BR>of any statistical sample of claims. .Some States argued that 
several<BR>NDCs on the HCFA computer list have been reassigned to drugs which 
are<BR>not LTE or IRS, which casts doubt on the validity of the audit 
results.<BR>See, e.g., Georgia Br. at 21.&nbsp; HCFA acknowledged that NDCs are 
sometimes<BR>prematurely reassigned.&nbsp; HCFA argued, however, that the FDA 
verified<BR>that the NDCs were still assigned to the drugs at issue as of July 
1989<BR>and that all the audit periods (except for the second New 
Jersey<BR>disallowance) involved were prior to that date.&nbsp; Therefore, 
HCFA<BR>contended that "recycled" NDCs could not have affected the accuracy 
of<BR>the audits.&nbsp; Nevertheless, HCFA agreed to recalculate the 
disallowance<BR>of any State which demonstrates that a particular NDC for which 
a claim<BR>was paid was not the drug listed for that NDC on the computer listing 
of<BR>LTE/IRS drugs.&nbsp; HCFA Master Br. at 29.&nbsp; Any State with such 
evidence<BR>should submit it to HCFA within 30 days of receiving this 
decision.<BR>HCFA should issue a written response to this issue, along with any 
other<BR>recalculations HCFA may make in the disallowance amounts.</P>
<P>The States presented a variety of arguments against the essential<BR>fairness 
and overall reliability of the audit results. 35/&nbsp; Some 
States<BR>complained that the computer list.developed by HCFA should have 
been<BR>provided to the States as a tool to modify their drug formularies 
or<BR>payment records, instead of employed retroactively to penalize them 
in<BR>an audit.&nbsp; See, e.g., Georgia Br. at 20; Maryland Br. at 8; 
Indiana<BR>Supp. Br. at 2.&nbsp; Further, the States argued that, if HCFA and 
the FDA<BR>could not maintain a complete list of LTE/IRS drugs and had to 
compile<BR>this list from various sources including some State listings, then it 
is<BR>unreasonable to expect any one State to keep a complete, current list 
on<BR>its own.&nbsp; See, e.g., Missouri Br. at 3 and 7.&nbsp; In addition, the 
efforts<BR>of various States led to differing conclusions, so that "no two 
states<BR>agreed on the status of all prescription products," despite good 
faith<BR>efforts.&nbsp; Id. at 10.&nbsp; Some States argued that, since each 
State is<BR>required to identify and stop payment on LTE/IRS drugs, the OIG 
should<BR>have deferred to each State's expert in determining which drugs were 
not<BR>reimbursable, absent some showing of negligent procedures by the 
State.<BR>See, e.g., Virginia Reply Br. at 8-9.&nbsp; Consequently, the States 
argued<BR>that it was unfair and improper for the OIG to compile a list 
from<BR>sources outside the State being reviewed, such as other States which 
may<BR>have reached different conclusions about particular drugs.</P>
<P>Certainly, compliance efforts would have been enhanced if the States 
had<BR>had ready access to some central listing and guidance in 
resolving<BR>difficult cases.&nbsp; As noted above, a number of States 
represented that<BR>inquiries to the FDA or HCFA to seek information to resolve 
questions<BR>about specific drugs met with slow or unresponsive results.&nbsp; 
It is not<BR>our role, however, to impose policy judgment on the operation of 
the<BR>LTE/IRS program, but rather to determine the enforceability of 
the<BR>particular disallowances before us.&nbsp; In so doing, we do not find 
it<BR>unreasonable for HCFA to approach the task of evaluating the 
States'<BR>compliance with LTE/IRS drug restrictions by seeking to compare 
State<BR>payment files against a master list of unreimbursable drugs.&nbsp; Nor 
is it<BR>unreasonable to use a variety of sources to compile as comprehensive 
a<BR>list as possible and then to seek FDA verification. 36/&nbsp; Our 
prior<BR>decisions have made clear that the States have the 
affirmative<BR>responsibility to identify and restrict payment on LTE/IRS drugs, 
using<BR>their own expertise.&nbsp; It.is not enough for the States to argue 
that<BR>their job could have been made easier by more federal coordination 
and<BR>better communication; the States must nevertheless shoulder their 
part<BR>of the job.&nbsp; The States have not shown any basis to invalidate the 
audit<BR>as a whole as unreliable or improper, and we therefore decline to do 
so.</P>
<P>Conclusion</P>
<P>For the reasons discussed above, we hold as follows:</P>
<P>&nbsp;We find that Bellergal was a readily identifiable IRS drug 
and<BR>&nbsp;we therefore sustain any disallowance for that drug product.</P>
<P>&nbsp;We find that dipyridamole is eligible for 
retroactive<BR>&nbsp;reimbursement, and we therefore reverse the disallowances 
for<BR>&nbsp;that drug product.</P>
<P>&nbsp;We find that it was unreasonable to expect the States 
to<BR>&nbsp;identify Naldecon and the Naldecon-related drug products as 
IRS<BR>&nbsp;to Dimetapp, and we therefore reverse the disallowances 
for<BR>&nbsp;those drugs.&nbsp; However, we sustain any disallowance for 
the<BR>&nbsp;period after issuance of the September 1989 State 
Medicaid<BR>&nbsp;Manual, which provided notice to the States that Naldecon 
was<BR>&nbsp;IRS.&nbsp; (The record only shows a later disallowance for New 
Jersey<BR>&nbsp;that would be affected.)&nbsp; We also sustain any disallowances 
for<BR>&nbsp;the original formulation of Dimetapp, which was clearly LTE 
(see<BR>&nbsp;fn. 21).</P>
<P>&nbsp;We decline to invalidate the drug payment termination 
process<BR>&nbsp;under which the States share the responsibility for the 
denial<BR>&nbsp;of Medicaid reimbursement for IRS drugs.&nbsp; Thus, we sustain 
the<BR>&nbsp;disallowances for any other drug product for which the 
States<BR>&nbsp;failed to make any specific arguments, as well as 
the<BR>&nbsp;disallowances for Pediacof Syrup and Meprogesic Tablets, 
for<BR>&nbsp;which we rejected the States' arguments.&nbsp; We reverse 
the<BR>&nbsp;disallowance for V.V.S. only if that drug product is the 
drug<BR>&nbsp;V.V.S. Vaginal Cream ruled by HCFA in 1991 not to be IRS.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Finally, we reject the States' challenges to the audit 
review<BR>&nbsp;process, except for certain recalculations, as follows:</P>
<P>&nbsp;-- HCFA is to notify any State which was audited against 
an<BR>&nbsp;earlier LTE/IRS drug list and should reexamine its 
claims<BR>&nbsp;against 
the.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
final, reduced list.&nbsp; Any State may<BR>&nbsp;appeal to us on this issue, 
within 30 days of its receipt of<BR>&nbsp;written notice of the results of 
HCFA's reexamination.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Any State with evidence that its 
disallowance<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;included amounts for a NDC that was reassigned at 
the<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;time to a drug not on the LTE/IRS drug list 
should<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;submit its documentation to HCFA within 30 days of 
this<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;decision.&nbsp; Any State may appeal HCFA's written 
response<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;on this issue to us within 30 days of its receipt.</P>
<P>&nbsp;We direct HCFA to adjust the amounts of the disallowances 
to<BR>&nbsp;reflect the above conclusions.&nbsp; As a result of this 
decision,<BR>&nbsp;there will be numerous recalculations of the 
disallowances.&nbsp; Any<BR>&nbsp;State that believes itself adversely affected 
by any<BR>&nbsp;recalculation determination may appeal that determination to 
the<BR>&nbsp;Board within 30 days of that determination.</P>

the<BR>disallowed drug products being appealed.</P>
<P>3.&nbsp; Each State submitted its own brief and appeal file, with the 
later<BR>opportunity to incorporate arguments made by other States.&nbsp; In 
addition<BR>to filing an individual response to each state brief, HCFA 
also<BR>submitted a Master Brief (Br.) applicable to all the arguments made 
by<BR>the States.&nbsp; When we refer to an argument offered by the States, it 
is<BR>possible that the particular argument was made by only one or some 
of<BR>the States.&nbsp; We will identify an exhibit (Ex.) by the name of 
the<BR>particular State that submitted it.</P>
<P>4.&nbsp; Sandoz manufactures two products, Bellergal and Bellergal-S, 
which<BR>contain the same active ingredients in different dosages and which 
do<BR>not differ in any way material here.&nbsp; We refer to both when we use 
the<BR>term "Bellergal."</P>
<P>5.&nbsp; The controversy between Sandoz and the FDA over Bellergal 
concerned<BR>a 1977 FDA determination that the Bellergal fell within the "new 
drug"<BR>category because Bellergal failed to meet the criteria for 
"grandfather"<BR>status.&nbsp; The FDA explained that Bellergal's labeling had 
changed, with<BR>some indications dropped from the current labeling and some 
new<BR>indications added to the current labeling not present in the 
pre-1938<BR>labeling.&nbsp; Illinois Ex. 4, at 2.&nbsp; Citing United States v. 
Allan Drug<BR>Corp., 357 F.2d 713 (10th Cir. 1966), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 899 
(1965),<BR>and 21 C.F.R. . 310.3(h), the FDA declared that the deletion of 
old<BR>claims and the addition of new claims for a drug product destroyed 
its<BR>"grandfather" status.&nbsp; Id.</P>
<P>Determinations of whether drugs are "new drugs" or are exempt under 
the<BR>"grandfather" clause fall within the authority of the FDA, subject 
to<BR>district court review.&nbsp; See Weinberger v. Hynson, Westcott &amp; 
Dunning,<BR>412 U.S. 609, 624 (1973).&nbsp; Significantly, Sandoz never 
challenged in<BR>district court the FDA's determination that Bellergal did not 
qualify<BR>for the "grandfather" exemption.&nbsp; Additionally, the 1983 NOOH 
that<BR>listed Donnatal and Belladenal as LTE drugs expressly stated that 
it<BR>"encompasses all issues relating to the legal status of the 
drug<BR>products subject to it (including identical, related or similar 
drug<BR>products . . .) e.g., any contention that any such product is not a 
new<BR>drug . . ."&nbsp; 48 Fed. Reg. 20,495, 20,501.&nbsp; The NOOH then warned 
that the<BR>failure to request a hearing "constitutes a waiver of any 
contentions<BR>concerning the legal status of any such drug product."&nbsp; 
Id.&nbsp; Sandoz made<BR>no request for a hearing.&nbsp; Therefore, the FDA's 
determination regarding<BR>Bellergal appears final, thus undercutting the 
States' position.</P>
<P>6.&nbsp; The FDA found ergotamine tartrate effective for prevention 
of<BR>vascular headaches, both alone as an aerosol and in combination 
with<BR>caffeine in tablet form.&nbsp; 37 Fed. Reg. 15,032 (July 27, 1975) 
(DESI<BR>5929).</P>
<P>7.&nbsp; However, two States which made specific arguments on Bellergal 
are<BR>those in which, HCFA asserted, the States' pharmacists admitted 
during<BR>their audits that they did not make any attempt to identify IRS 
drugs,<BR>since they believed it was the responsibility of the FDA.&nbsp; See 
fns. 31<BR>and 32 infra.</P>
<P>8.&nbsp; This January 15, 1987 NOOH specifically named 62 
dipyridamole<BR>products.&nbsp; A February 23, 1987 NOOH added 16 dipyridamole 
products.&nbsp; 52<BR>Fed. Reg. 5,501.&nbsp; A May 8, 1987 NOOH further added 
three more<BR>dipyridamole products.&nbsp; 52 Fed. Reg. 17,477.&nbsp; The States 
argued that, in<BR>the event the Board should find that dipyridamole was a LTE 
drug, any<BR>disallowances for drug products named in the February and May 
NOOHs<BR>should be measured from these later NOOHs, plus the applicable 
grace<BR>periods, rather than from the January NOOH.&nbsp; HCFA responded that 
the<BR>later NOOHs specifically referred to the January 15, 1987 NOOH, 
and,<BR>therefore, the January NOOH applied to all dipyridamole products, 
and<BR>that in any the other generics would certainly have been IRS to those 
in<BR>the first NOOH.&nbsp; In view of our conclusion that the States' claims 
for<BR>dipyridamole should be retroactively reimbursed, we need not 
address<BR>this matter.</P>
<P>9.&nbsp; We note that all but one of the States whose claims for 
dipyridamole<BR>were denied had disallowances for audit periods that began prior 
to the<BR>January 1987 NOOH that announced dipyridamole's LTE status.&nbsp; We 
accept<BR>HCFA's assertion that the disallowances were calculated to include 
only<BR>those claims for dipyridamole that were submitted after the 
publication<BR>of the NOOH and applicable grace period, and acknowledge that 
HCFA<BR>expressed willingness to recalculate the disallowances of any State 
that<BR>demonstrated otherwise.&nbsp; HCFA Br. at 62, n.35.&nbsp; However, this 
issue is<BR>moot, in light of the determination that all the claims for 
dipyridamole<BR>are eligible for retroactive reimbursement.</P>
<P>10.&nbsp; All the parties pointed to the uniqueness of 
dipyridamole's<BR>situation, which arose not only from the substitution of a 
new<BR>indication but the grant of a marketing exclusivity period, which 
did<BR>not prevent the generics from being sold as identical to Persantine 
but<BR>did prevent them from promoting their drugs for the new use.&nbsp; 
The<BR>confusion which resulted from the FDA's actions is demonstrated by 
an<BR>article in the March 20, 1987 newsletter of the American 
Pharmaceutical<BR>Association, Pharmacy Weekly (Maryland Ex. 14), which noted 
that it was<BR>unclear whether the FDA's action precluded Medicaid payment for 
generic<BR>dipyridamole and quoted a HCFA employee saying, "We have no 
clear<BR>answers.&nbsp; We are asking for our General Counsel to help us set a 
policy<BR>for this."&nbsp; Id. at 2.</P>
<P>The record before us shows that at least one State specifically<BR>submitted 
a written inquiry to HCFA regarding the implications of the<BR>January 1987 NOOH 
regarding Medicaid reimbursement of dipyridamole drug<BR>products.&nbsp; 
Maryland Ex. 15.&nbsp; In July 1987 HCFA responded that FFP would<BR>be 
available for Persantine, but not for other dipyridamole products.<BR>Maryland 
Ex. 17.&nbsp; There is no indication, however, that HCFA<BR>communicated this 
information to any of the other States.&nbsp; In fact, one<BR>State alleged that 
a HCFA representative specifically told two State<BR>employees that FFP would 
not be denied for dipyridamole even after the<BR>January 1987 NOOH.&nbsp; Texas 
Exs. A and B.&nbsp; Texas argued that, on the basis<BR>of this representation, 
HCFA should be estopped from taking any<BR>disallowance action on claims for 
dipyridamole.&nbsp; HCFA denied that its<BR>representative gave any such advice 
to Texas employees and argued that<BR>Texas failed to establish that it met the 
elements for asserting<BR>estoppel against the federal government.&nbsp; See, 
e.g., Heckler v.<BR>Community Health Services, 467 U.S. 51 (1984), and Office of 
Personnel<BR>Management v. Richmond, 496 U.S. 414 (1990), reh. denied 59 
U.S.L.W.<BR>3137 (1990).&nbsp; Inasmuch as we are reversing the disallowances 
for<BR>dipyridamole, we see no need for determining whether an estoppel 
defense<BR>would be appropriate under these particular circumstances.</P>
<P>11.&nbsp; The parties have not raised, and we have not addressed, 
any<BR>distinction among dipyridamole claims based on whether the 
manufacturers<BR>pursued hearing requests or the dates that their abbreviated 
NDAs were<BR>approved.&nbsp; We presume that the products which were withdrawn 
from the<BR>market are not reflected in the claims, and our conclusion 
on<BR>retroactive reimbursement makes the date of each product's 
approval<BR>irrelevant.</P>
<P>12.&nbsp; Of course, it is possible that some physicians 
prescribed<BR>dipyridamole in either brand name or generic form for its 
former<BR>ineffective indication.&nbsp; Some claims may be for still other 
indications<BR>for which the parties have noted that the product has been 
commonly used<BR>by physicians.&nbsp; See, e.g., Oregon Ex. 7; New York Ex. 
4.&nbsp; Such<BR>"off-label" use is an accepted and lawful practice.&nbsp; See, 
e.g., PDR at<BR>Foreword.&nbsp; The methods used to handle claims for 
prescription drugs<BR>under Medicaid do not enable the States to distinguish the 
use for which<BR>a drug was prescribed.&nbsp; The anomaly which would result 
from denying<BR>retroactive reimbursement for the generic drugs here is that FFP 
would<BR>be paid for Persantine prescribed by a doctor for the treatment 
of<BR>chronic angina pectoris, an indication for which all brands 
of<BR>dipyridamole, including Persantine, have been found ineffective.&nbsp; 
Yet<BR>FFP would be denied (for a three-year period) for a prescription 
of<BR>dipyridamole filled by a generic, even though admittedly 
chemically<BR>identical and bioequivalent to Persantine, for purposes for which 
it has<BR>been ultimately proven effective and been approved for labeling.</P>
<P>13.&nbsp; One manufacturer of a dipyridamole product estimated in 1990 
that<BR>the nationwide market for dipyridamole was in excess of $110 
million.<BR>Missouri Ex. 5, at 2.</P>
<P>14.&nbsp; New Jersey determined that, on average, the brand name 
Persantine,<BR>in all strengths, cost 525% more than generic dipyridamole.&nbsp; 
Indiana<BR>Appendix B at 1.&nbsp; The total cost of generic dipyridamole during 
New<BR>Jersey's audit period was placed at $674,183, while the estimated 
cost<BR>if Persantine had been substituted was put at $3,651,070.&nbsp; 
Indiana<BR>Appendix B at 3.</P>
<P>15.&nbsp; The States also argued that FFP for dipyridamole claims should 
be<BR>allowed because there was "a compelling justification for its 
medical<BR>need" for dipyridamole as an antiplatelet drug and produced 
articles<BR>from medical journals to support this indication.&nbsp; See Oregon 
Exs. 4, at<BR>A, and 7, at D and E.&nbsp; Section 1862(c)(1)(D) of the Act 
allows FFP if<BR>the Secretary of DHHS has made a determination that such a 
justification<BR>exists.&nbsp; We agree with HCFA that the authority to make 
such a<BR>determination lies solely with the Secretary.&nbsp; The Board is not 
the<BR>proper forum to address this argument.</P>
<P>16.&nbsp; The terms "Naldecon-related" drugs, or simply Naldecon, are 
used<BR>here to include various drug products which allegedly are IRS 
to<BR>Dimetapp, in that these drugs have among their ingredients more than 
one<BR>decongestant or more than one antihistamine.&nbsp; Among the 
Naldecon-related<BR>drugs that are subject to disallowances here are the 
following drug<BR>products:&nbsp; Entex, RuTuss, Tedral New-Decongestant, 
Tri-Phen-Chlor,<BR>Naldelate, Naldelate Syrup, Nalgest, Naldagen, Naldec, Naldec 
Syrup,<BR>Quadrahist, Decongestabs, Par de Con, Sinucon, and other unnamed 
drugs.</P>
<P>17.&nbsp; Rather than drawing the conclusion that it was the presence of 
two<BR>decongestants that made the old formulation of Dimetapp ineffective, 
it<BR>could also have been reasonably inferred that it was the presence of 
a<BR>particular ingredient, phenylephrine hydrochloride, that made the 
old<BR>formulation ineffective.&nbsp; The old, ineffective Dimetapp had that as 
an<BR>ingredient; the new, effective Dimetapp did not.&nbsp; If the States 
had<BR>reasonably inferred that phenylephrine hydrochloride had been the 
reason<BR>for finding original Dimetapp LTE, the States would have 
erroneously<BR>identified every cold product with that ingredient as its 
only<BR>decongestant as IRS.&nbsp; The FDA has never found, however, 
that<BR>phenylephrine hydrochloride is ineffective.</P>
<P>18.&nbsp; We further note that the reference was to a FDA notice 
published<BR>some seven years earlier.&nbsp; We question whether it is 
reasonable to<BR>require state personnel charged with monitoring NOOHs to 
maintain an<BR>indefinite backlog of Federal Registers in the event a future 
NOOH might<BR>obliquely contain a reference to one of them.</P>
<P>19.&nbsp; The FDA did later publish in the Federal Register as a notice 
of<BR>proposed rulemaking a "tentative final monograph" on the 
recommendations<BR>of the OTC review panel.&nbsp; This occurred on August 12, 
1988.&nbsp; 53 Fed.<BR>Reg. 30,522.&nbsp; The Board is unaware of any 
publication of a final version<BR>of the monograph.</P>
<P>20.&nbsp; In the "tentative final monograph," some 12 years later, the 
FDA,<BR>in response to public comments, wrote:</P>
<P>&nbsp;Category I active ingredients from the same therapeutic 
category<BR>&nbsp;that have the same mechanism should not ordinarily be 
combined<BR>&nbsp;unless there is some advantage over the single ingredient 
in<BR>&nbsp;terms of enhancing effectiveness, safety, patient acceptance, 
or<BR>&nbsp;quality of formulation.&nbsp; Thus, the [FDA]'s combination 
policy<BR>&nbsp;does not set limits on the number of ingredients from the 
same<BR>&nbsp;pharmacologic group that may be combined, provided data 
are<BR>&nbsp;presented to show the combination meets the necessary 
criteria.<BR>&nbsp;Combinations containing ingredients from the same 
pharmacologic<BR>&nbsp;group will be permitted if adequate data are presented to 
the<BR>&nbsp;agency.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *</P>
<P>&nbsp;The [FDA] agrees that no fixed limit need be placed upon 
the<BR>&nbsp;number of active ingredients in a combination product if it 
can<BR>&nbsp;be shown to be a rational, safe, and effective combination 
with<BR>&nbsp;a suitable target population.</P>
<P>53 Fed. Reg. 30,522, 30,535.</P>
<P>21.&nbsp; Indiana appealed a disallowance for claims for the 
original<BR>formulation of Dimetapp.&nbsp; Indiana argued that since Dimetapp 
was later<BR>found effective this disallowance should be reversed.&nbsp; This 
argument<BR>ignores the fact that the disapproved Dimetapp and the approved 
Dimetapp<BR>are two distinct drug products, with the former being specifically 
found<BR>LTE.&nbsp; While we are reversing the disallowances for Naldecon 
and<BR>Naldecon-related drug products, we sustain any disallowances the 
States<BR>may have received for the original formulation of Dimetapp.</P>
<P>22.&nbsp; The States also argued that a significant difference in the 
dosage<BR>amounts in the decongestant ingredients in Dimetapp and Naldecon 
removed<BR>the possibility that Naldecon could be considered IRS to Dimetapp, 
with<BR>the dosages of two decongestants in Naldecon providing a 
therapeutic<BR>effect that Dimetapp's decongestants lacked.&nbsp; See, e.g., 
Virginia Ex. 22<BR>and Oregon Ex. 7.&nbsp; Since the disallowances for Naldecon 
are being<BR>reversed, there is no need to consider this argument further.</P>
<P>23.&nbsp; The only State before us which will apparently be affected by 
our<BR>holding that the September 1989 Manual announcement constitutes 
notice<BR>that Naldecon is an IRS drug is New Jersey, which had a 
second<BR>disallowance issued for the audited period July 1, 1988 
through<BR>September 30, 1990.</P>
<P>24.&nbsp; Some of the problems that the States experienced in 
the<BR>identification of IRS drug products may be alleviated by 
HCFA's<BR>publication of updated lists of IRS drugs in the State Medicaid 
Manual.<BR>If HCFA continues to timely update this list, the difficulties that 
the<BR>States have experienced in removing IRS drug products from 
their<BR>reimbursement rolls in a timely fashion should be reduced.&nbsp; With 
the<BR>publication of IRS drugs in the Manual, the States have 
been<BR>definitively put on notice of what drug products are considered 
IRS<BR>drugs by HCFA and hence are ineligible for FFP.&nbsp; The publication of 
a<BR>list of IRS drugs in the State Medicaid Manual does not, 
however,<BR>relieve the States of their continued responsibility to monitor 
the<BR>Federal Register for NOOHs and to act expeditiously on their own, 
as<BR>reasonably as can be expected, in removing drug products IRS to 
LTE<BR>drugs listed in the Federal Register.</P>
<P>25.&nbsp; In this regard, it is noteworthy that the States have 
presented<BR>arguments articulating difficulty identifying only relatively 
few<BR>allegedly IRS drugs, out of the hundreds of products listed as IRS 
in<BR>the final audit list.&nbsp; If the process of identifying IRS drugs 
were<BR>generally as difficult as the States argued here, it is reasonable 
to<BR>expect such arguments to have been made for far more drug 
products.<BR>Thus, we conclude, as we did in Pennsylvania, that the States are 
able<BR>to make IRS determinations in most cases without great difficulty.</P>
<P>26.&nbsp; Two States argued that HCFA issued disallowances for some 
drug<BR>products that were manufactured by small companies and therefore did 
not<BR>appear in national drug compendia.&nbsp; The States argued that, 
under<BR>Louisiana, disallowances should not be taken for such IRS drugs that 
are<BR>difficult to identify.&nbsp; North Carolina named three such drugs, UAD 
Forte<BR>Lotion, Bantuss HC Syrup, and Bantuss C Expectorant.&nbsp; Virginia 
claimed<BR>the following drugs were also unlisted in compendia:&nbsp; Tuss-Ade 
TD Caps,<BR>Bionade C-modified, Vertab, Unituss, Naldec, Quadrahist, Vaginal 
Sulfa,<BR>Isolate Cpd, Nafazair, ParDeCon, Oratuss, Naldegen, and Sinocon.</P>
<P>In addition to its assertion that its audit list was already reduced 
to<BR>exclude drugs not listed in compendia, HCFA responded that these 
drug<BR>products did, in fact, appear in national drug compendia.&nbsp; 
Marion<BR>Declaration,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . 19.&nbsp; The States did not deny 
this assertion in their<BR>reply briefs, and we therefore decline to pursue the 
issue of these<BR>drugs any further.&nbsp; We do note, however, that many of 
these drug<BR>products are "Naldecon-related" drugs whose disallowances we 
have<BR>reversed on other grounds.</P>
<P>One State also argued that its disallowances for miscellaneous 
drugs<BR>should be reversed because HCFA's delays in this case prevented it 
from<BR>making effective arguments on these drugs since the State's 
pharmacist<BR>left State employment in the interim.&nbsp; New Jersey Br. at 
4-5.&nbsp; This<BR>State, however, failed to show why it could not have obtained 
access to<BR>any other expert assistance, if needed.&nbsp; We find no prejudice 
to New<BR>Jersey and sustain the disallowances for those drugs as to which 
no<BR>arguments were raised.</P>
<P>27.&nbsp; One State mentioned two drugs as examples of the confusing 
nature<BR>of the DESI process but did not effectively articulate why it could 
not<BR>reasonably have identified them as IRS drugs.&nbsp; North Carolina Br. at 
6.<BR>Thus, the State complained that it did not understand why one 
sulfonmide<BR>(V.V.S.) is IRS to the LTE drug called AVC, while another drug 
product<BR>(Sultrin Triple Sulfa) is not.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; The State, however, 
provided no<BR>information about the ingredients, dosages, or indications of 
these<BR>drugs.&nbsp; We note, however, that in an August 1991 State Medicaid 
Manual<BR>transmittal HCFA announced that as of January 24, 1986, due to 
product<BR>reformulation, V.V.S. Vaginal Cream was no longer an IRS drug.&nbsp; 
Due to<BR>lack of information provided by the State, we are unable to 
determine<BR>whether this V.V.S. Vaginal Cream is the drug product V.V.S. of 
which<BR>the State complained.&nbsp; If it is, HCFA should adjust its 
disallowance<BR>accordingly.</P>
<P>The State also asserted that a generic product (Meprogesic Tablets) 
was<BR>declared IRS, while the corresponding brand name product (Equagesic) 
was<BR>"removed form the DESI list in June 1988."&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; The State 
provided no<BR>evidence to support this statement, and Equagesic still appears 
as a LTE<BR>drug on the State Medicaid Manual lists in 1989 and 1991.&nbsp; We 
therefore<BR>decline to reverse disallowances based only on these 
unsubstantiated or<BR>erroneous assertions by the State.</P>
<P>28.&nbsp; Those states were Pennsylvania, Maryland, Maine, 
Virginia,<BR>Connecticut, Illinois, and Massachusetts.</P>
<P>29.&nbsp; The NDC is supposed to be unique to a specific product and is 
not<BR>supposed to be reassigned until at least five years after a product 
is<BR>discontinued.&nbsp; Gerstenzang Declaration, HCFA Ex. 1, at . 31-b.</P>
<P>30.&nbsp; See Attachment C of this decision for a listing of each 
State's<BR>audit period.</P>
<P>31.&nbsp; HCFA also alleged that Illinois' drug expert stated during 
the<BR>audit that he did not attempt to review for similar and related 
drugs,<BR>since he believed that the FDA should make that determination 
first.<BR>HCFA Illinois Br. at 7, and Ex. 3.</P>
<P>32.&nbsp; HCFA stated that the State pharmacist admitted during the 
audit<BR>that he did not monitor the Federal Register for LTE/IRS drug 
notices.<BR>HCFA Indiana Br. at 2.</P>
<P>33.&nbsp; In particular, HCFA should notify Virginia as to whether its 
audit<BR>was based on the final list or whether it falls into the 
category<BR>affected here.&nbsp; See Virginia Reply Br. at 10.&nbsp; Virginia 
objected to this<BR>procedure on the basis that the OIG may decline to reaudit 
it and that<BR>HCFA cannot be relied on to perform any recalculation.&nbsp; 
Therefore,<BR>Virginia argued that the audit should be invalidated as 
unreliable.&nbsp; We<BR>decline to take this step.&nbsp; The discrepancy between 
the FDA-verified<BR>list and the final HCFA list resulted largely from HCFA's 
adjustment to<BR>reflect our decision in Louisiana, rather than from the lack 
of<BR>forthrightness or sloppy administration attributed to HCFA by 
Virginia.<BR>See Virginia Reply Br. at 9-12.&nbsp; The States have not 
demonstrated any<BR>inherent unreliability in the audits, and HCFA has offered 
to<BR>recalculate the disallowances to reflect the reduced number of drugs 
on<BR>the final list.&nbsp; We conclude that this approach is preferable 
to<BR>remanding these appeals to begin again the entire lengthy audit 
process.</P>
<P>34.&nbsp; New York also argued that the State's paid claims history file 
used<BR>in the audit included claims from outside the audit period.&nbsp; New 
York<BR>Reply Br. at 9.&nbsp; Since New York's appeal involved only 
dipyridamole,<BR>which has been held eligible for FFP, we find this issue 
moot.</P>
<P>35.&nbsp; Virginia challenged the validity of the audit based 
discrepancies<BR>between a list of LTE/IRS drugs on a computer diskette, which 
the State<BR>obtained from HCFA, and HCFA's audit program as to some of the 
drugs<BR>included and as to the NOOH dates listed.&nbsp; Also, Virginia argued 
that<BR>its State drug claim files showed different amounts of FFP 
received<BR>during the audit period.&nbsp; However, the LTE/IRS list used by 
Virginia to<BR>evaluate the reliability of the master audit list is described by 
the<BR>State only as having "presumably matched the list published by HCFA 
in<BR>the September 1989 State Medicaid Manual."&nbsp; Virginia Reply Br. at 
11,<BR>n.10.&nbsp; The audit list was derived from other sources, while HCFA 
never<BR>contended that the list in the Manual was comprehensive.&nbsp; See, 
e.g.,<BR>State Medicaid Manual, . 4370.3 (April 1983) (acknowledges that IRS 
list<BR>"may not include all drugs which are affected"); . 4370 (September 
1989)<BR>(declares that "this list is not all-inclusive").&nbsp; Therefore, 
the<BR>existence of discrepancies between the two lists does not 
demonstrate<BR>that the audit list was unreliable.&nbsp; Further, the difference 
in the<BR>total FFP shown by state records and the OIG audit report is not 
a<BR>sufficient basis to conclude that the audit report was not 
reliable,<BR>since Virginia has not eliminated other possible reasons, 
including<BR>errors in calculation or unreliability of State records.</P>
<P>36.&nbsp; Our conclusion regarding Naldecon makes clear, however, that 
the<BR>States may not be responsible where their experts cannot 
reasonably<BR>identify a drug as IRS, simply because another State's expert has 
done<BR>so.</P>
<P>37.&nbsp; HCFA suggested that North Carolina's return of $325,095 left 
only<BR>$491,036 in dispute.&nbsp; HCFA North Carolina Br. at 2-3.&nbsp; North 
Carolina,<BR>however, reiterated that it continued to press its appeal of the 
total<BR>disallowance.&nbsp; North Carolina Reply Br. at 2-3.</P>
<P>38.&nbsp; In the course of the appeal, HCFA reduced New Jersey's 
disallowance<BR>by $5,510.50 for OTC<BR></P>
