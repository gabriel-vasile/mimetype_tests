    Sec. 113a. Establishment of research laboratories for foot-and-
      mouth disease and other animal diseases; research contracts;
      employment of technicians and scientists; appropriations

-STATUTE-
      The Secretary of Agriculture is authorized to establish research
    laboratories, including the acquisition of necessary land,
    buildings, or facilities, and also the making of research contracts
    under the authority contained in section 427i(a) of title 7, for
    research and study, in the United States or elsewhere, of foot-and-
    mouth disease and other animal diseases which in the opinion of
    the Secretary constitute a threat to the livestock industry of the
    United States: Provided, That no live virus of foot-and-mouth
    disease may be introduced for any purpose into any part of the
    mainland of the United States (except coastal islands separated
    therefrom by water navigable for deep-water navigation and which
    shall not be connected with the mainland by any tunnel) unless the
    Secretary determines that it is necessary and in the public
    interest for the conduct of research and study in the United States
    (except at Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, New York) and
    issues a permit under such rules as the Secretary shall promulgate
    to protect animal health, except that the Secretary of Agriculture
    may transport said virus in the original package across the
    mainland under adequate safeguards, and except further, that in the
    event of outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in this country, the
    Secretary of Agriculture may, at his discretion, permit said virus
    to be brought into the United States under adequate safeguards. To
    carry out the provisions of this section, the Secretary is
    authorized to employ technical experts or scientists: Provided,
    That the number so employed shall not exceed five and that the
    maximum compensation for each shall not exceed the highest rate of
    grade 18 of the General Schedule. There is authorized to be
    appropriated such sums as Congress may deem necessary; in addition,
    the Secretary is authorized to utilize in carrying out this
    section, funds otherwise available for the control or eradication
    of such diseases.

      Provisions that authorized the Secretary to employ technical
    experts and scientists "without regard to the Classification Act",
    meaning the Classification Act of 1923, were omitted as obsolete.
    Sections 1202 and 1204 of the Classification Act of 1949, 63 Stat.
    972, 973, repealed the 1923 Act and all laws or parts of laws
    inconsistent with the 1949 Act. While section 1106(a) of the 1949
    Act provided that references in other laws to the 1923 Act should
    be held and considered to mean the 1949 Act, it did not have the
    effect of continuing the exception contained in this section
    because of section 1106(b) which provided that the application of
    the 1949 Act to any position, officer, or employee shall not be
    affected by section 1106(a). The Classification Act of 1949 was
    repealed by Pub. L. 89-554, Sept. 6, 1966, Sec. 8(a), 80 Stat. 632
    (the first section of which revised and enacted Title 5, Government
    Organization and Employees, into law). Section 5102 of Title 5
    contains the applicability provisions of the 1949 Act, and section
    5103 of Title 5 authorizes the Office of Personnel Management to
    determine the applicability to specific positions and employees.

      (2) Limitation
        In setting the fees under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall
      ensure that the amount of the fees is commensurate with the costs
      of agricultural quarantine and inspection services with respect
      to the class of persons or entities paying the fees. The costs of
      the services with respect to passengers as a class includes the
      costs of related inspections of the aircraft or other vehicle.

      the Secretary may prescribe.
      (4) Late payment penalties
        If a person subject to a fee under this subsection fails to pay

        collected under this subsection and late payment penalties and
        interest charges collected under paragraph (4) through fiscal
        year 2002.
        (B) Use of account
          For each of fiscal years 1996 through 2002, funds in the
        Agricultural Quarantine Inspection User Fee Account shall be
        available, in such amounts as are provided in advance in
        appropriations Acts, to cover the costs associated with the
        provision of agricultural quarantine and inspection services

        (B) until expended, without further appropriation.
      (6) Use of amounts collected after fiscal year 2002
        After September 30, 2002, the unobligated balance in the
      Agricultural Quarantine Inspection User Fee Account and fees and
      other amounts collected under this subsection shall be credited
      to the Department of Agriculture accounts that incur the costs
      associated with the provision of agricultural quarantine and
      inspection services and the administration of this subsection.
      The fees and other amounts shall remain available to the
      Secretary until expended without fiscal year limitation.
      (7) Staff years
        The number of full-time equivalent positions in the Department
      of Agriculture attributable to the provision of agricultural
      quarantine and inspection services and the administration of this
      subsection shall not be counted toward the limitation on the
      total number of full-time equivalent positions in all agencies
      specified in section 5(b) of the Federal Workforce Restructuring
      Act of 1994 (Public Law 103-226; 5 U.S.C. 3101 note) or other

    Sec. 143. Inspection; certified statement in lieu thereof; waiver
      of requirements of section 142; regulations; suspension and
      revocation of permits

-STATUTE-
      The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall cause such
    inspections to be made as are necessary to insure that milk and
    cream are so produced and handled as to comply with the provisions
    of section 142 of this title, and in all cases when he finds that
    such milk and/or cream is produced and handled so as not to be
    unfit for importation under clauses 1, 2, and 3 of section 142 of
    this title, he shall issue to persons making application therefor
    permits to ship milk and/or cream into the United States: Provided,
    That in lieu of the inspections to be made by or under the
    direction of the Secretary he may, in his discretion, accept a duly
    certified statement signed by a duly accredited official of an
    authorized department of any foreign government and/or of any State
    of the United States or any municipality thereof that the
    provisions in clauses 1, 2, and 3 of section 142 of this title have
    been complied with. Such certificate of the accredited official of
    an authorized department of any foreign government shall be in the
    form prescribed by the Secretary, who is authorized and directed to
    prescribe such form as well as rules and regulations regulating the
    issuance of permits to import milk or cream into the United States.
      The Secretary is authorized, in his discretion, to waive the
    requirement of clause 4 of section 142 of this title when issuing
    permits to operators of condenseries in which milk and/or cream is
    used when sterilization of the milk and/or cream is a necessary
    process: Provided, however, That no milk and/or cream shall be
    imported whose bacterial count per cubic centimeter in any event
    exceeds one million two hundred thousand: Provided, further, That
    such requirements shall not be waived unless the farm producing
    such milk to be imported is within a radius of fifteen miles of the
    condensery in which it is to be processed: Provided further, That
    if milk and/or cream imported when the requirements of clause 4 of
    section 142 of this title, have been so waived, is sold, used, or
    disposed of in its raw state or otherwise than as condensed milk by
    any person, the permit shall be revoked and the importer shall be
    subject to fine, imprisonment, or other penalty prescribed by this
    subchapter.
      The Secretary is directed to waive the requirements of clauses 2
    and 5 of section 142 of this title insofar as the same relate to
    milk when issuing permits to operators of, or to producers for
    delivery to, creameries and condensing plants in the United States
    within twenty miles of the point of production of the milk, and who
    import no raw milk except for pasteurization or condensing:
    Provided, That if milk imported when the requirements of clauses 2
    and 5 of section 142 of this title have been so waived is sold,
    used, or disposed of in its raw state, or otherwise than as
    pasteurized, condensed, or evaporated milk by any person, the
    permit shall be revoked and the importer shall be subjected to
    fine, imprisonment, or other penalty prescribed by this subchapter.
      The Secretary is authorized and directed to make and enforce such
    regulations as may in his judgment be necessary to carry out the
    purpose of this subchapter for the handling of milk and cream, for
    the inspection of milk, cream, cows, barns, and other facilities
    used in the production and handling of milk and/or cream and the
    handling, keeping, transporting, and importing of milk and/or
    cream: Provided, however, That unless and until the Secretary shall
    provide for inspections to ascertain that clauses 1, 2, and 3 of
    section 142 of this title have been complied with, the Secretary
    shall issue temporary permits to any applicants therefor to ship or
    transport milk and/or cream into the United States.
      The Secretary is authorized to suspend or revoke any permit for
    the shipment of milk or cream into the United States when he shall
    find that the holder thereof has failed to comply with the
    provisions of or has violated this subchapter or any of the
    regulations made hereunder, or that the milk and/or cream brought
    or shipped by the holder of such permit into the United States is
    not produced and handled in conformity with, or that the quality
    thereof does not conform to, all of the provisions of section 142
    of this title.

    Sec. 206. Revocation of license

-STATUTE-
      The license of any person whose permanent allegiance is due to
    the United States to practice pharmacy in the consular districts of
    the United States in China may be revoked by the consul if such
    person be found to have obtained such license by fraud, or be
    addicted to the use of any narcotic or stimulant, or to be
    suffering from physical or mental disease, in such manner and to
    such extent as to render it expedient that in the interests of the
    public his license be canceled; or to be of an immoral character;
    or if such person be convicted in any court of competent
    jurisdiction of any offense involving moral turpitude. It shall be
    the duty of the consul to investigate any case in which it is
    discovered by him or made to appear to his satisfaction that any
    license issued under the provisions of this chapter is revocable
    and shall, after full hearing, if in his judgment the facts warrant
    it, revoke such license.

    allegiance is due to the United States from furnishing in good
    faith for the use of any habitual user of narcotic drugs who is
    under his professional care such substances as he may deem

-HEAD-
    Sec. 209. Poisons; book entry of sale; labels

-STATUTE-
      It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, or corporation whose
    permanent allegiance is due to the United States to sell or deliver
    to any other person any of the following-described substances, or
    any poisonous compound, combination, or preparation thereof, to
    wit: The compounds of and salts of antimony, arsenic, barium,
    chromium, copper, gold, lead, mercury, silver, and zinc, the
    caustic hydrates of sodium and potassium, solution or water of
    ammonia, methyl alcohol, paregoric, the concentrated mineral acids,
    oxalic and hydrocyanic acids and their salts, yellow phosphorus,
    Paris green, carbolic acid, the essential oils of almonds,
    pennyroyal, tansy, rue, and savin; croton oil, creosote,
    chloroform, cantharides, or aconite, belladonna, bitter almonds,
    colchicum, cotton root, cocculus indicus, conium, cannabis indica,
    digitalis, ergot, hyoscyamus, ignatia, lobelia, nux vomica,
    physostigma, phytolacca, strophanthus, stramonium, veratrum viride,
    or any of the poisonous alkaloids or alkaloidal salts derived from
    the foregoing, or any other poisonous alkaloids or their salts, or
    any other virulent poison, except in the manner following, and,
    moreover, if the applicant be less than eighteen years of age,
    except upon the written order of a person known or believed to be
    an adult.
      It shall first be learned, by due inquiry, that the person to
    whom delivery is about to be made is aware of the poisonous
    character of the substance and that it is desired for a lawful
    purpose, and the box, bottle, or other package shall be plainly
    labeled with the name of the substance, the word "Poison", the name
    of at least one suitable antidote, when practicable, and the name
    and address of the person, firm, or corporation dispensing the
    substance. And before delivery be made of any of the foregoing
    substances, excepting solution or water of ammonia and sulphate of
    copper, there shall be recorded in a book kept for that purpose the
    name of the article, the quantity delivered, the purpose for which
    it is to be used, the date of delivery, the name and address of the
    person for whom it is procured, and the name of the individual
    personally dispensing the same; and said book shall be preserved by
    the owner thereof for at least three years after the date of the
    last entry therein. The foregoing provisions shall not apply to
    articles dispensed upon the order of persons believed by the
    dispenser to be recognized and reputable practitioners of medicine,
    dentistry, or veterinary surgery. When a physician writes upon his
    prescription a request that it be marked or labeled "Poison" the
    pharmacist shall, in the case of liquids, place the same in a
    colored glass, roughened bottle, of the kind commonly known in
    trade as a "poison bottle", and, in the case of dry substances, he
    shall place a poison label upon the container. The record of sale
    and delivery above mentioned shall not be required of manufacturers
    and wholesalers who shall sell any of the foregoing substances at
    wholesale to licensed pharmacists, but the box, bottle, or other
    package containing such substance, when sold at wholesale, shall be
    properly labeled with the name of the substance, the word "poison",
    and the name and address of the manufacturer or wholesaler. It
    shall not be necessary, in sales either at wholesale or at retail,
    to place a poison label upon, nor to record the delivery of, the
    sulphide of antimony, or the oxide or carbonate of zinc, or of
    colors ground in oil and intended for use as paints, or calomel;
    nor in the case of preparations containing any of the substances
    named in this section, when a single box, bottle, or other package,
    or when the bulk of one-half fluid ounce or the weight of one-half
    avoirdupois ounce does not contain more than an adult medicinal
    dose of such substance; nor in the case of liniments or ointments
    sold in good faith as such, when plainly labeled "For external use
    only"; nor, in the case of preparations put up and sold in the form
    of pills, tablets, or lozenges, containing any of the substances
    enumerated in this section and intended for internal use, when the
    dose recommended does not contain more than one-fourth of an adult
    medicinal dose of such substance.
      For the purpose of this and of every other section of this
    chapter no box, bottle, or other package shall be regarded as
    having been labeled "Poison" unless the word "Poison" appears
    conspicuously thereon, printed in plain, uncondensed gothic letters
    in red ink.

    dispensed at such store or pharmacy, or a copy of such
    prescription, except when the preservation of the original is
    required by section 207 or 208 of this title. Upon request the
    owner, part owner, or manager of such store shall furnish to the
    prescribing physician, or to the person for whom such prescription
    was compounded or dispensed, a true and correct copy thereof. Any
    prescription required by section 207 or 208 of this title, and any
    prescription for, or register of sales of, substances mentioned in
    such sections shall at all times be open to inspection by duly
    authorized consular officers in the consular districts of the
    United States in China. No person, firm, or corporation whose
    permanent allegiance is due to the United States shall, in a
    consular district, compound or dispense any drug or drugs or
    deliver the same to any other person without marking on the
    container thereof the name of the drug or drugs contained therein
    and directions for using the same.

    provided that:

    bearing labeling which, prior to February 1, 1939, was
    lithographed, etched, stamped, pressed, printed, fused or blown on
    or in such containers, where compliance with such provisions would
    be unduly burdensome by reason of causing the loss of valuable
    stocks of such labeling or containers, and where such postponement
    would not prevent the public interest being adequately served:
    Provided, That in no case shall such regulations apply to labeling
    which would not have complied with the requirements of the Food and
    Drugs Act of June 30, 1906, as amended.

    [sections 1 to 5, 7 to 15, and 372a of this title] to the extent
    that they impose, or authorize the imposition of, any requirement

    Act [section 343(k) of this title], shall remain in force until
    January 1, 1940.

    such section shall not apply - 
        "(1) to the provisions of section 502(d) and (e) of the Federal
      Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [352(d), (e) of this title], insofar
      as such provisions relate to any substance named in section 8
      [section 10 of this title], paragraph second, under the heading
      'In the case of drugs:', of the Food and Drugs Act of June 30,
      1906, as amended, or a derivative of any such substance; or
        "(2) to the provisions of section 502(b), (d), (e), (f), (g),
      and (h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [352(b), (d)
      to (h) of this title], insofar as such provisions relate to drugs

    of this Act, and thereafter the Secretary is authorized hereby to
    (1) conduct hearings and to promulgate regulations which shall

    meaning of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act
    [7 U.S.C. 136 et seq.], including all active and inert ingredients
    of such pesticide. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the
    term "pesticide" within such meaning includes ethylene oxide and
    propylene oxide when such substances are applied on food.
      (B) In the case of the use, with respect to food, of a substance
    described in clause (A) to prevent, destroy, repel, or mitigate
    microorganisms (including bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa,
    algae, and slime), the following applies for purposes of clause
    (A):
        (i) The definition in such clause for the term "pesticide
      chemical" does not include the substance if the substance is
      applied for such use on food, or the substance is included for
      such use in water that comes into contact with the food, in the
      preparing, packing, or holding of the food for commercial
      purposes. The substance is not excluded under this subclause from
      such definition if the substance is ethylene oxide or propylene
      oxide, and is applied for such use on food. The substance is not
      so excluded if the substance is applied for such use on a raw
      agricultural commodity, or the substance is included for such use
      in water that comes into contact with the commodity, as follows:
          (I) The substance is applied in the field.
          (II) The substance is applied at a treatment facility where
        raw agricultural commodities are the only food treated, and the
        treatment is in a manner that does not change the status of the
        food as a raw agricultural commodity (including treatment
        through washing, waxing, fumigating, and packing such
        commodities in such manner).
          (III) The substance is applied during the transportation of
        such commodity between the field and such a treatment facility.

        (ii) The definition in such clause for the term "pesticide
      chemical" does not include the substance if the substance is a
      food contact substance as defined in section 348(h)(6) of this
      title, and any of the following circumstances exist: The
      substance is included for such use in an object that has a food
      contact surface but is not intended to have an ongoing effect on
      any portion of the object; the substance is included for such use
      in an object that has a food contact surface and is intended to
      have an ongoing effect on a portion of the object but not on the
      food contact surface; or the substance is included for such use
      in or is applied for such use on food packaging (without regard
      to whether the substance is intended to have an ongoing effect on
      any portion of the packaging). The food contact substance is not
      excluded under this subclause from such definition if any of the
      following circumstances exist: The substance is applied for such
      use on a semipermanent or permanent food contact surface (other
      than being applied on food packaging); or the substance is
      included for such use in an object that has a semipermanent or
      permanent food contact surface (other than being included in food
      packaging) and the substance is intended to have an ongoing
      effect on the food contact surface.

    With respect to the definition of the term "pesticide" that is
    applicable to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide
    Act [7 U.S.C. 136 et seq.], this clause does not exclude any
    substance from such definition.
      (2) The term "pesticide chemical residue" means a residue in or
    on raw agricultural commodity or processed food of - 
        (A) a pesticide chemical; or
        (B) any other added substance that is present on or in the
      commodity or food primarily as a result of the metabolism or
      other degradation of a pesticide chemical.

      (3) Notwithstanding subparagraphs (1) and (2), the Administrator
    may by regulation except a substance from the definition of
    "pesticide chemical" or "pesticide chemical residue" if - 
        (A) its occurrence as a residue on or in a raw agricultural
      commodity or processed food is attributable primarily to natural
      causes or to human activities not involving the use of any
      substances for a pesticidal purpose in the production, storage,
      processing, or transportation of any raw agricultural commodity
      or processed food; and
        (B) the Administrator, after consultation with the Secretary,
      determines that the substance more appropriately should be
      regulated under one or more provisions of this chapter other than
      sections 342(a)(2)(B) and 346a of this title.

      (r) The term "raw agricultural commodity" means any food in its
    raw or natural state, including all fruits that are washed,
    colored, or otherwise treated in their unpeeled natural form prior
    to marketing.
      (s) The term "food additive" means any substance the intended use
    of which results or may reasonably be expected to result, directly
    or indirectly, in its becoming a component or otherwise affecting
    the characteristics of any food (including any substance intended
    for use in producing, manufacturing, packing, processing,
    preparing, treating, packaging, transporting, or holding food; and
    including any source of radiation intended for any such use), if
    such substance is not generally recognized, among experts qualified
    by scientific training and experience to evaluate its safety, as
    having been adequately shown through scientific procedures (or, in
    the case of a substance used in food prior to January 1, 1958,
    through either scientific procedures or experience based on common
    use in food) to be safe under the conditions of its intended use;
    except that such term does not include - 
        (1) a pesticide chemical residue in or on a raw agricultural
      commodity or processed food; or
        (2) a pesticide chemical; or
        (3) a color additive; or
        (4) any substance used in accordance with a sanction or
      approval granted prior to September 6, 1958, pursuant to this
      chapter, the Poultry Products Inspection Act [21 U.S.C. 451 et
      seq.] or the Meat Inspection Act of March 4, 1907, as amended and
      extended [21 U.S.C. 601 et seq.];
        (5) a new animal drug; or
        (6) an ingredient described in paragraph (ff) in, or intended
      for use in, a dietary supplement.

      (t)(1) The term "color additive" means a material which - 
        (A) is a dye, pigment, or other substance made by a process of
      synthesis or similar artifice, or extracted, isolated, or
      otherwise derived, with or without intermediate or final change
      of identity, from a vegetable, animal, mineral, or other source,
      and
        (B) when added or applied to a food, drug, or cosmetic, or to
      the human body or any part thereof, is capable (alone or through
      reaction with other substance) of imparting color thereto;

    except that such term does not include any material which the
    Secretary, by regulation, determines is used (or intended to be
    used) solely for a purpose or purposes other than coloring.
      (2) The term "color" includes black, white, and intermediate
    grays.
      (3) Nothing in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall be
    construed to apply to any pesticide chemical, soil or plant
    nutrient, or other agricultural chemical solely because of its
    effect in aiding, retarding, or otherwise affecting, directly or
    indirectly, the growth or other natural physiological processes of
    produce of the soil and thereby affecting its color, whether before
    or after harvest.
      (u) The term "safe" as used in paragraph (s) of this section and
    in sections 348, 360b, 360ccc, and 379e of this title, has
    reference to the health of man or animal.
      (v) The term "new animal drug" means any drug intended for use
    for animals other than man, including any drug intended for use in
    animal feed but not including such animal feed, -

      conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling
      thereof; except that such a drug not so recognized shall not be
      deemed to be a "new animal drug" if at any time prior to June 25,
      1938, it was subject to the Food and Drug Act of June 30, 1906,
      as amended, and if at such time its labeling contained the same
      representations concerning the conditions of its use; or
        (2) the composition of which is such that such drug, as a
      result of investigations to determine its safety and
      effectiveness for use under such conditions, has become so
      recognized but which has not, otherwise than in such
      investigations, been used to a material extent or for a material
      time under such conditions.

    Provided that any drug intended for minor use or use in a minor

    the Secretary through notice and comment rulemaking finding that
    the criteria of paragraphs (1) and (2) have not been met (or that
    the exception to the criterion in paragraph (1) has been met) is a
    new animal drug.
      (w) The term "animal feed", as used in paragraph (w) (!1) of this
    section, in section 360b of this title, and in provisions of this
    chapter referring to such paragraph or section, means an article

    301 of this title] or the amendments made by this Act shall be
    construed to affect the question of whether the Secretary of Health
    and Human Services has any authority to regulate any tobacco
    product, tobacco ingredient, or tobacco additive. Such authority,
    if any, shall be exercised under the Federal Food, Drug, and
    Cosmetic Act [21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.] as in effect on the day before
    the date of the enactment of this Act [Nov. 21, 1997]."

            CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS RELATING TO PUB. L. 103-417        
      Section 2 of Pub. L. 103-417 provided that: "Congress finds that -
     
        "(1) improving the health status of United States citizens
      ranks at the top of the national priorities of the Federal
      Government;
        "(2) the importance of nutrition and the benefits of dietary
      supplements to health promotion and disease prevention have been
      documented increasingly in scientific studies;
        "(3)(A) there is a link between the ingestion of certain
      nutrients or dietary supplements and the prevention of chronic
      diseases such as cancer, heart disease, and osteoporosis; and
        "(B) clinical research has shown that several chronic diseases
      can be prevented simply with a healthful diet, such as a diet
      that is low in fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium, with
      a high proportion of plant-based foods;
        "(4) healthful diets may mitigate the need for expensive
      medical procedures, such as coronary bypass surgery or
      angioplasty;
        "(5) preventive health measures, including education, good
      nutrition, and appropriate use of safe nutritional supplements
      will limit the incidence of chronic diseases, and reduce long-
      term health care expenditures;
        "(6)(A) promotion of good health and healthy lifestyles
      improves and extends lives while reducing health care
      expenditures; and
        "(B) reduction in health care expenditures is of paramount
      importance to the future of the country and the economic well-
      being of the country;
        "(7) there is a growing need for emphasis on the dissemination
      of information linking nutrition and long-term good health;
        "(8) consumers should be empowered to make choices about
      preventive health care programs based on data from scientific
      studies of health benefits related to particular dietary
      supplements;
        "(9) national surveys have revealed that almost 50 percent of
      the 260,000,000 Americans regularly consume dietary supplements
      of vitamins, minerals, or herbs as a means of improving their
      nutrition;
        "(10) studies indicate that consumers are placing increased
      reliance on the use of nontraditional health care providers to
      avoid the excessive costs of traditional medical services and to
      obtain more holistic consideration of their needs;
        "(11) the United States will spend over $1,000,000,000,000 on
      health care in 1994, which is about 12 percent of the Gross
      National Product of the United States, and this amount and
      percentage will continue to increase unless significant efforts
      are undertaken to reverse the increase;
        "(12)(A) the nutritional supplement industry is an integral
      part of the economy of the United States;
        "(B) the industry consistently projects a positive trade
      balance; and
        "(C) the estimated 600 dietary supplement manufacturers in the
      United States produce approximately 4,000 products, with total
      annual sales of such products alone reaching at least
      $4,000,000,000;
        "(13) although the Federal Government should take swift action
      against products that are unsafe or adulterated, the Federal
      Government should not take any actions to impose unreasonable
      regulatory barriers limiting or slowing the flow of safe products
      and accurate information to consumers;
        "(14) dietary supplements are safe within a broad range of
      intake, and safety problems with the supplements are relatively
      rare; and
        "(15)(A) legislative action that protects the right of access
      of consumers to safe dietary supplements is necessary in order to
      promote wellness; and
        "(B) a rational Federal framework must be established to
      supersede the current ad hoc, patchwork regulatory policy on
      dietary supplements."

     DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION REGARDING THE DANGERS OF DRUG ABUSE 
      Section 5 of Pub. L. 90-639 provided that: "It is the sense of
    the Congress that, because of the inadequate knowledge on the part
    of the people of the United States of the substantial adverse
    effects of misuse of depressant and stimulant drugs, and of other
    drugs liable to abuse, on the individual, his family, and the
    community, the highest priority should be given to Federal programs
    to disseminate information which may be used to educate the public,
    particularly young persons, regarding the dangers of drug abuse."

             CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF POLICY         
      Section 2 of Pub. L. 89-74 provided that: "The Congress hereby
    finds and declares that there is a widespread illicit traffic in
    depressant and stimulant drugs moving in or otherwise affecting
    interstate commerce; that the use of such drugs, when not under the
    supervision of a licensed practitioner, often endangers safety on
    the highways (without distinction of interstate and intrastate
    traffic thereon) and otherwise has become a threat to the public
    health and safety, making additional regulation of such drugs
    necessary regardless of the intrastate or interstate origin of such
    drugs; that in order to make regulation and protection of
    interstate commerce in such drugs effective, regulation of
    intrastate commerce is also necessary because, among other things,
    such drugs, when held for illicit sale, often do not bear labeling
    showing their place of origin and because in the form in which they
    are so held or in which they are consumed a determination of their
    place of origin is often extremely difficult or impossible; and
    that regulation of interstate commerce without the regulation of
    intrastate commerce in such drugs, as provided in this Act [see
    Short Title of 1965 Amendment note set out under section 301 of
    this title], would discriminate against and adversely affect
    interstate commerce in such drugs."

       EFFECT OF DRUG ABUSE CONTROL AMENDMENTS OF 1965 ON STATE LAWS   
      Section 10 of Pub. L. 89-74 provided that:
      "(a) Nothing in this Act [enacting section 360a of this title,
    amending sections 321, 331, 333, 334, 360, and 372 of this title
    and section 1114 of Title 18, Crimes and Criminal Procedure, and
    enacting provisions set out as notes under sections 321, 352, and
    360a of this title] shall be construed as authorizing the
    manufacture, compounding, processing, possession, sale, delivery,
    or other disposal of any drug in any State in contravention of the
    laws of such State.
      "(b) No provision of this Act nor any amendment made by it shall
    be construed as indicating an intent on the part of the Congress to
    occupy the field in which such provision or amendment operates to
    the exclusion of any State law on the same subject matter, unless
    there is a direct and positive conflict between such provision or
    amendment and such State law so that the two cannot be reconciled
    or consistently stand together.
      "(c) No amendment made by this Act shall be construed to prevent
    the enforcement in the courts of any State of any statute of such
    State prescribing any criminal penalty for any act made criminal by
    any such amendment."

              EFFECT OF DRUG AMENDMENTS OF 1962 ON STATE LAWS          
      Section 202 of Pub. L. 87-781 provided that: "Nothing in the
    amendments made by this Act [enacting sections 358 to 360, amending
    sections 321, 331, 332, 348, 351 to 353, 355, 357, 372, 374, 379e,
    and 381 of this title, and enacting provisions set out as notes
    under sections 321, 331, 332, 352, 355, 360, and 374 of this title]
    to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [this chapter] shall be
    construed as invalidating any provision of State law which would be
    valid in the absence of such amendments unless there is a direct
    and positive conflict between such amendments and such provision of
    State law."

      Section 2 of Pub. L. 105-115 provided that: "In this Act [see
    Short Title of 1997 Amendment note set out under section 301 of
    this title], the terms 'drug', 'device', 'food', and 'dietary

    of this section, (1) for having received in interstate commerce any
    article and delivered it or proffered delivery of it, if such
    delivery or proffer was made in good faith, unless he refuses to
    furnish on request of an officer or employee duly designated by the

    or received such article and copies of all documents, if any there
    be, pertaining to the delivery of the article to him; or (2) for

    of an alleged violation of section 331(a) of this title, that such
    article is not adulterated or misbranded, within the meaning of
    this chapter designating this chapter or to the effect, in case of
    an alleged violation of section 331(d) of this title, that such

    section 344 or 355 of this title, be introduced into interstate
    commerce; or (3) for having violated section 331(a) of this title,
    where the violation exists because the article is adulterated by

    chapter, if such person establishes a guaranty or undertaking
    signed by, and containing the name and address of, the manufacturer

    regulations promulgated by the Secretary under this chapter; or (4)

    the time thereof contained the same directions for use and warning
    statements as were contained in the labeling at the time of such
    receipt of such article; or (5) for having violated section
    331(i)(2) of this title if such person acted in good faith and had
    no reason to believe that use of the punch, die, plate, stone, or
    other thing involved would result in a drug being a counterfeit
    drug, or for having violated section 331(i)(3) of this title if the
    person doing the act or causing it to be done acted in good faith
    and had no reason to believe that the drug was a counterfeit drug.

      No person shall be subject to the penalties of subsection (a)(1)
    of this section for a violation of section 331 of this title

    the food is misbranded under section 343(a)(2) of this title
    because of its advertising.

      (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), whoever knowingly

    amount not to exceed $15,000 for each such violation, and not to
    exceed $1,000,000 for all such violations adjudicated in a single
    proceeding. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a person
    accredited under paragraph (2) of section 374(g) of this title who
    is substantially not in compliance with the standards of
    accreditation under such section, or who poses a threat to public
    health or fails to act in a manner that is consistent with the
    purposes of such section, shall be considered to have violated a
    requirement of this chapter that relates to devices.
      (B) Subparagraph (A) shall not apply - 
        (i) to any person who violates the requirements of section
      360i(a) or 360j(f) of this title unless such violation
      constitutes (I) a significant or knowing departure from such
      requirements, or (II) a risk to public health,
        (ii) to any person who commits minor violations of section
      360i(e) or 360i(f) of this title (only with respect to correction
      reports) if such person demonstrates substantial compliance with
      such section, or
        (iii) to violations of section 351(a)(2)(A) of this title which
      involve one or more devices which are not defective.

      (2)(A) Any person who introduces into interstate commerce or
    delivers for introduction into interstate commerce an article of
    food that is adulterated within the meaning of section 342(a)(2)(B)
    of this title shall be subject to a civil money penalty of not more
    than $50,000 in the case of an individual and $250,000 in the case
    of any other person for such introduction or delivery, not to
    exceed $500,000 for all such violations adjudicated in a single
    proceeding.
      (B) This paragraph shall not apply to any person who grew the
    article of food that is adulterated. If the Secretary assesses a
    civil penalty against any person under this paragraph, the
    Secretary may not use the criminal authorities under this section
    to sanction such person for the introduction or delivery for
    introduction into interstate commerce of the article of food that
    is adulterated. If the Secretary assesses a civil penalty against
    any person under this paragraph, the Secretary may not use the
    seizure authorities of section 334 of this title or the injunction
    authorities of section 332 of this title with respect to the
    article of food that is adulterated.
      (C) In a hearing to assess a civil penalty under this paragraph,
    the presiding officer shall have the same authority with regard to
    compelling testimony or production of documents as a presiding
    officer has under section 346a(g)(2)(B) of this title. The third
    sentence of paragraph (3)(A) shall not apply to any investigation
    under this paragraph.
      (3)(A) A civil penalty under paragraph (1) or (2) shall be
    assessed by the Secretary by an order made on the record after
    opportunity for a hearing provided in accordance with this
    subparagraph and section 554 of title 5. Before issuing such an
    order, the Secretary shall give written notice to the person to be
    assessed a civil penalty under such order of the Secretary's
    proposal to issue such order and provide such person an opportunity
    for a hearing on the order. In the course of any investigation, the
    Secretary may issue subpoenas requiring the attendance and
    testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence that relates
    to the matter under investigation.
      (B) In determining the amount of a civil penalty, the Secretary
    shall take into account the nature, circumstances, extent, and
    gravity of the violation or violations and, with respect to the
    violator, ability to pay, effect on ability to continue to do
    business, any history of prior such violations, the degree of
    culpability, and such other matters as justice may require.
      (C) The Secretary may compromise, modify, or remit, with or
    without conditions, any civil penalty which may be assessed under
    paragraph (1) or (2). The amount of such penalty, when finally
    determined, or the amount agreed upon in compromise, may be
    deducted from any sums owing by the United States to the person
    charged.
      (4) Any person who requested, in accordance with paragraph
    (3)(A), a hearing respecting the assessment of a civil penalty and
    who is aggrieved by an order assessing a civil penalty may file a
    petition for judicial review of such order with the United States
    Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit or for any
    other circuit in which such person resides or transacts business.
    Such a petition may only be filed within the 60-day period
    beginning on the date the order making such assessment was issued.
      (5) If any person fails to pay an assessment of a civil penalty -
    
        (A) after the order making the assessment becomes final, and if
      such person does not file a petition for judicial review of the
      order in accordance with paragraph (4), or
        (B) after a court in an action brought under paragraph (4) has
      entered a final judgment in favor of the Secretary,

    the Attorney General shall recover the amount assessed (plus
    interest at currently prevailing rates from the date of the
    expiration of the 60-day period referred to in paragraph (4) or the
    date of such final judgment, as the case may be) in an action
    brought in any appropriate district court of the United States. In
    such an action, the validity, amount, and appropriateness of such
    penalty shall not be subject to review.

    purposes of the preceding sentence, a person accredited under
    paragraph (2) of section 374(g) of this title who is substantially
    not in compliance with the standards of accreditation under such
    section, or who poses a threat to public health or fails to act in

-HEAD-
    Sec. 334. Seizure

-STATUTE-
    (a) Grounds and jurisdiction
      (1) Any article of food, drug, or cosmetic that is adulterated or
    misbranded when introduced into or while in interstate commerce or
    while held for sale (whether or not the first sale) after shipment
    in interstate commerce, or which may not, under the provisions of
    section 344 or 355 of this title, be introduced into interstate
    commerce, shall be liable to be proceeded against while in
    interstate commerce, or at any time thereafter, on libel of
    information and condemned in any district court of the United
    States or United States court of a Territory within the
    jurisdiction of which the article is found. No libel for
    condemnation shall be instituted under this chapter, for any
    alleged misbranding if there is pending in any court a libel for
    condemnation proceeding under this chapter based upon the same
    alleged misbranding, and not more than one such proceeding shall be
    instituted if no such proceeding is so pending, except that such
    limitations shall not apply (A) when such misbranding has been the
    basis of a prior judgment in favor of the United States, in a
    criminal, injunction, or libel for condemnation proceeding under
    this chapter, or (B) when the Secretary has probable cause to
    believe from facts found, without hearing, by him or any officer or
    employee of the Department that the misbranded article is dangerous
    to health, or that the labeling of the misbranded article is
    fraudulent, or would be in a material respect misleading to the
    injury or damage of the purchaser or consumer. In any case where
    the number of libel for condemnation proceedings is limited as
    above provided the proceeding pending or instituted shall, on
    application of the claimant, seasonably made, be removed for trial
    to any district agreed upon by stipulation between the parties, or,
    in case of failure to so stipulate within a reasonable time, the
    claimant may apply to the court of the district in which the
    seizure has been made, and such court (after giving the United
    States attorney for such district reasonable notice and opportunity
    to be heard) shall by order, unless good cause to the contrary is
    shown, specify a district of reasonable proximity to the claimant's
    principal place of business, to which the case shall be removed for
    trial.
      (2) The following shall be liable to be proceeded against at any
    time on libel of information and condemned in any district court of
    the United States or United States court of a Territory within the
    jurisdiction of which they are found: (A) Any drug that is a
    counterfeit drug, (B) Any container of a counterfeit drug, (C) Any
    punch, die, plate, stone, labeling, container, or other thing used
    or designed for use in making a counterfeit drug or drugs, and (D)
    Any adulterated or misbranded device.
      (3)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), no libel for
    condemnation may be instituted under paragraph (1) or (2) against
    any food which - 
        (i) is misbranded under section 343(a)(2) of this title because
      of its advertising, and
        (ii) is being held for sale to the ultimate consumer in an
      establishment other than an establishment owned or operated by a
      manufacturer, packer, or distributor of the food.

      (B) A libel for condemnation may be instituted under paragraph
    (1) or (2) against a food described in subparagraph (A) if - 
        (i)(I) the food's advertising which resulted in the food being
      misbranded under section 343(a)(2) of this title was disseminated
      in the establishment in which the food is being held for sale to
      the ultimate consumer,
        (II) such advertising was disseminated by, or under the
      direction of, the owner or operator of such establishment, or
        (III) all or part of the cost of such advertising was paid by
      such owner or operator; and
        (ii) the owner or operator of such establishment used such
      advertising in the establishment to promote the sale of the food.
    (b) Procedure; multiplicity of pending proceedings
      The article, equipment, or other thing proceeded against shall be
    liable to seizure by process pursuant to the libel, and the
    procedure in cases under this section shall conform, as nearly as
    may be, to the procedure in admiralty; except that on demand of
    either party any issue of fact joined in any such case shall be
    tried by jury. When libel for condemnation proceedings under this
    section, involving the same claimant and the same issues of
    adulteration or misbranding, are pending in two or more
    jurisdictions, such pending proceedings, upon application of the
    claimant seasonably made to the court of one such jurisdiction,
    shall be consolidated for trial by order of such court, and tried
    in (1) any district selected by the claimant where one of such
    proceedings is pending; or (2) a district agreed upon by
    stipulation between the parties. If no order for consolidation is
    so made within a reasonable time, the claimant may apply to the
    court of one such jurisdiction and such court (after giving the
    United States attorney for such district reasonable notice and
    opportunity to be heard) shall by order, unless good cause to the
    contrary is shown, specify a district of reasonable proximity to
    the claimant's principal place of business, in which all such
    pending proceedings shall be consolidated for trial and tried. Such
    order of consolidation shall not apply so as to require the removal
    of any case the date for trial of which has been fixed. The court
    granting such order shall give prompt notification thereof to the
    other courts having jurisdiction of the cases covered thereby.
    (c) Availability of samples of seized goods prior to trial
      The court at any time after seizure up to a reasonable time
    before trial shall by order allow any party to a condemnation
    proceeding, his attorney or agent, to obtain a representative
    sample of the article seized and a true copy of the analysis, if
    any, on which the proceeding is based and the identifying marks or
    numbers, if any, of the packages from which the samples analyzed
    were obtained.
    (d) Disposition of goods after decree of condemnation; claims for
      remission or mitigation of forfeitures
      (1) Any food, drug, device, or cosmetic condemned under this
    section shall, after entry of the decree, be disposed of by
    destruction or sale as the court may, in accordance with the
    provisions of this section, direct and the proceeds thereof, if
    sold, less the legal costs and charges, shall be paid into the
    Treasury of the United States; but such article shall not be sold
    under such decree contrary to the provisions of this chapter or the
    laws of the jurisdiction in which sold. After entry of the decree
    and upon the payment of the costs of such proceedings and the
    execution of a good and sufficient bond conditioned that such
    article shall not be sold or disposed of contrary to the provisions
    of this chapter or the laws of any State or Territory in which
    sold, the court may by order direct that such article be delivered
    to the owner thereof to be destroyed or brought into compliance
    with the provisions of this chapter, under the supervision of an
    officer or employee duly designated by the Secretary, and the
    expenses of such supervision shall be paid by the person obtaining
    release of the article under bond. If the article was imported into
    the United States and the person seeking its release establishes
    (A) that the adulteration, misbranding, or violation did not occur
    after the article was imported, and (B) that he had no cause for
    believing that it was adulterated, misbranded, or in violation
    before it was released from customs custody, the court may permit
    the article to be delivered to the owner for exportation in lieu of
    destruction upon a showing by the owner that all of the conditions
    of section 381(e) of this title can and will be met. The provisions
    of this sentence shall not apply where condemnation is based upon
    violation of section 342(a)(1), (2), or (6), section 351(a)(3),
    section 352(j), or section 361(a) or (d) of this title. Where such
    exportation is made to the original foreign supplier, then
    subparagraphs (A) and (B) of section 381(e)(1) of this title and
    the preceding sentence shall not be applicable; and in all cases of
    exportation the bond shall be conditioned that the article shall
    not be sold or disposed of until the applicable conditions of
    section 381(e) of this title have been met. Any person seeking to
    export an imported article pursuant to any of the provisions of
    this subsection shall establish that the article was intended for
    export at the time the article entered commerce. Any article
    condemned by reason of its being an article which may not, under
    section 344 or 355 of this title, be introduced into interstate
    commerce, shall be disposed of by destruction.
      (2) The provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection shall, to
    the extent deemed appropriate by the court, apply to any equipment
    or other thing which is not otherwise within the scope of such
    paragraph and which is referred to in paragraph (2) of subsection
    (a) of this section.
      (3) Whenever in any proceeding under this section, involving
    paragraph (2) of subsection (a) of this section, the condemnation
    of any equipment or thing (other than a drug) is decreed, the court
    shall allow the claim of any claimant, to the extent of such
    claimant's interest, for remission or mitigation of such forfeiture
    if such claimant proves to the satisfaction of the court (i) that
    he has not committed or caused to be committed any prohibited act
    referred to in such paragraph (2) and has no interest in any drug
    referred to therein, (ii) that he has an interest in such equipment
    or other thing as owner or lienor or otherwise, acquired by him in
    good faith, and (iii) that he at no time had any knowledge or
    reason to believe that such equipment or other thing was being or
    would be used in, or to facilitate, the violation of laws of the
    United States relating to counterfeit drugs.
    (e) Costs
      When a decree of condemnation is entered against the article,
    court costs and fees, and storage and other proper expenses, shall
    be awarded against the person, if any, intervening as claimant of
    the article.
    (f) Removal of case for trial
      In the case of removal for trial of any case as provided by
    subsection (a) or (b) of this section - 
        (1) The clerk of the court from which removal is made shall
      promptly transmit to the court in which the case is to be tried
      all records in the case necessary in order that such court may
      exercise jurisdiction.
        (2) The court to which such case was removed shall have the
      powers and be subject to the duties, for purposes of such case,
      which the court from which removal was made would have had, or to
      which such court would have been subject, if such case had not
      been removed.
    (g) Administrative restraint; detention orders
      (1) If during an inspection conducted under section 374 of this
    title of a facility or a vehicle, a device which the officer or
    employee making the inspection has reason to believe is adulterated
    or misbranded is found in such facility or vehicle, such officer or
    employee may order the device detained (in accordance with
    regulations prescribed by the Secretary) for a reasonable period
    which may not exceed twenty days unless the Secretary determines
    that a period of detention greater than twenty days is required to
    institute an action under subsection (a) of this section or section
    332 of this title, in which case he may authorize a detention
    period of not to exceed thirty days. Regulations of the Secretary
    prescribed under this paragraph shall require that before a device
    may be ordered detained under this paragraph the Secretary or an
    officer or employee designated by the Secretary approve such order.
    A detention order under this paragraph may require the labeling or
    marking of a device during the period of its detention for the
    purpose of identifying the device as detained. Any person who would
    be entitled to claim a device if it were seized under subsection
    (a) of this section may appeal to the Secretary a detention of such
    device under this paragraph. Within five days of the date an appeal
    of a detention is filed with the Secretary, the Secretary shall
    after affording opportunity for an informal hearing by order
    confirm the detention or revoke it.
      (2)(A) Except as authorized by subparagraph (B), a device subject
    to a detention order issued under paragraph (1) shall not be moved
    by any person from the place at which it is ordered detained until -
     
        (i) released by the Secretary, or
        (ii) the expiration of the detention period applicable to such
      order,

    whichever occurs first.
      (B) A device subject to a detention order under paragraph (1) may
    be moved - 
        (i) in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary,
      and
        (ii) if not in final form for shipment, at the discretion of
      the manufacturer of the device for the purpose of completing the
      work required to put it in such form.
    (h) Administrative detention of foods
      (1) Detention authority
        (A) In general
          An officer or qualified employee of the Food and Drug
        Administration may order the detention, in accordance with this
        subsection, of any article of food that is found during an
        inspection, examination, or investigation under this chapter
        conducted by such officer or qualified employee, if the officer
        or qualified employee has credible evidence or information
        indicating that such article presents a threat of serious
        adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals.
        (B) Secretary's approval
          An article of food may be ordered detained under subparagraph
        (A) only if the Secretary or an official designated by the
        Secretary approves the order. An official may not be so
        designated unless the official is the director of the district
        under this chapter in which the article involved is located, or
        is an official senior to such director.
      (2) Period of detention
        An article of food may be detained under paragraph (1) for a
      reasonable period, not to exceed 20 days, unless a greater
      period, not to exceed 30 days, is necessary, to enable the
      Secretary to institute an action under subsection (a) of this
      section or section 332 of this title. The Secretary shall by
      regulation provide for procedures for instituting such action on
      an expedited basis with respect to perishable foods.
      (3) Security of detained article
        An order under paragraph (1) with respect to an article of food
      may require that such article be labeled or marked as detained,
      and shall require that the article be removed to a secure
      facility, as appropriate. An article subject to such an order
      shall not be transferred by any person from the place at which
      the article is ordered detained, or from the place to which the
      article is so removed, as the case may be, until released by the
      Secretary or until the expiration of the detention period
      applicable under such order, whichever occurs first. This
      subsection may not be construed as authorizing the delivery of
      the article pursuant to the execution of a bond while the article
      is subject to the order, and section 381(b) of this title does
      not authorize the delivery of the article pursuant to the
      execution of a bond while the article is subject to the order.
      (4) Appeal of detention order
        (A) In general
          With respect to an article of food ordered detained under
        paragraph (1), any person who would be entitled to be a
        claimant for such article if the article were seized under
        subsection (a) of this section may appeal the order to the
        Secretary. Within five days after such an appeal is filed, the
        Secretary, after providing opportunity for an informal hearing,
        shall confirm or terminate the order involved, and such
        confirmation by the Secretary shall be considered a final
        agency action for purposes of section 702 of title 5. If during
        such five-day period the Secretary fails to provide such an
        opportunity, or to confirm or terminate such order, the order
        is deemed to be terminated.
        (B) Effect of instituting court action
          The process under subparagraph (A) for the appeal of an order
        under paragraph (1) terminates if the Secretary institutes an
        action under subsection (a) of this section or section 332 of
        this title regarding the article of food involved.

          described in subsection (a)(1) of this section,

        if the Secretary finds that the type of conduct which served as
        the basis for such conviction undermines the process for the
        regulation of drugs.
        (B) Individuals
          (i) Any individual whom the Secretary finds has been
        convicted of -

          (ii) Any individual whom the Secretary finds has been
        convicted of - 
            (I) a felony which is not described in subsection (a)(2) of

        requirements under this chapter relating to drug products.
          (iii) Any individual whom the Secretary finds materially
        participated in acts that were the basis for a conviction for
        an offense described in subsection (a) of this section or in
        clause (i) or (ii) for which a conviction was obtained, if the
        Secretary finds, on the basis of such participation and other
        information, that such individual has demonstrated a pattern of
        conduct sufficient to find that there is reason to believe that
        such individual may violate requirements under this chapter
        relating to drug products.
          (iv) Any high managerial agent whom the Secretary finds - 
            (I) worked for, or worked as a consultant for, the same
          person as another individual during the period in which such
          other individual took actions for which a felony conviction
          was obtained and which resulted in the debarment under

          other individual,
            (II) had actual knowledge of the actions described in

          avoid such actual knowledge, or failed to take action for the
          purpose of avoiding such actual knowledge,
            (III) knew that the actions described in subclause (I) were
          violative of law, and
            (IV) did not report such actions, or did not cause such
          actions to be reported, to an officer, employee, or agent of
          the Department or to an appropriate law enforcement officer,
          or failed to take other appropriate action that would have
          ensured that the process for the regulation of drugs was not
          undermined, within a reasonable time after such agent first
          knew of such actions,

        if the Secretary finds that the type of conduct which served as
        the basis for such other individual's conviction undermines the
        process for the regulation of drugs.

        an audit under this section) any abbreviated drug application
        submitted by or with the assistance of a person debarred under
        subsection (a)(1) or (b)(2)(A) of this section during the
        period such person is debarred,
          (B) shall, during the period of a debarment under subsection
        (a)(2) or (b)(2)(B) of this section, debar an individual from
        providing services in any capacity to a person that has an
        approved or pending drug product application and shall not
        accept or review (other than in connection with an audit under
        this section) an abbreviated drug application from such
        individual, and
          (C) shall, if the Secretary makes the finding described in
        paragraph (6) or (7) of section 335b(a) of this title, assess a
        civil penalty in accordance with section 335b of this title.
      (2) Debarment periods
        (A) In general
          The Secretary shall debar a person under subsection (a) or
        (b) of this section for the following periods:
            (i) The period of debarment of a person (other than an
          individual) under subsection (a)(1) of this section shall not
          be less than 1 year or more than 10 years, but if an act
          leading to a subsequent debarment under subsection (a) of
          this section occurs within 10 years after such person has
          been debarred under subsection (a)(1) of this section, the
          period of debarment shall be permanent.
            (ii) The debarment of an individual under subsection (a)(2)
          of this section shall be permanent.
            (iii) The period of debarment of any person under paragraph
          (2) or (3) of subsection (b) of this section shall not be
          more than 5 years.

        The Secretary may determine whether debarment periods shall run
        concurrently or consecutively in the case of a person debarred
        for multiple offenses.
        (B) Notification
          Upon a conviction for an offense described in subsection (a)
        or (b) of this section or upon execution of an agreement with
        the United States to plead guilty to such an offense, the
        person involved may notify the Secretary that the person
        acquiesces to debarment and such person's debarment shall
        commence upon such notification.
      (3) Considerations
        In determining the appropriateness and the period of a
      debarment of a person under subsection (b) of this section and
      any period of debarment beyond the minimum specified in
      subparagraph (A)(i) of paragraph (2), the Secretary shall
      consider where applicable - 
          (A) the nature and seriousness of any offense involved,
          (B) the nature and extent of management participation in any
        offense involved, whether corporate policies and practices
        encouraged the offense, including whether inadequate
        institutional controls contributed to the offense,
          (C) the nature and extent of voluntary steps to mitigate the
        impact on the public of any offense involved, including the
        recall or the discontinuation of the distribution of suspect
        drugs, full cooperation with any investigations (including the
        extent of disclosure to appropriate authorities of all
        wrongdoing), the relinquishing of profits on drug approvals
        fraudulently obtained, and any other actions taken to
        substantially limit potential or actual adverse effects on the
        public health,
          (D) whether the extent to which changes in ownership,
        management, or operations have corrected the causes of any
        offense involved and provide reasonable assurances that the
        offense will not occur in the future,
          (E) whether the person to be debarred is able to present
        adequate evidence that current production of drugs subject to
        abbreviated drug applications and all pending abbreviated drug
        applications are free of fraud or material false statements,
        and
          (F) prior convictions under this chapter or under other Acts
        involving matters within the jurisdiction of the Food and Drug
        Administration.
    (d) Termination of debarment
      (1) Application
        Any person that is debarred under subsection (a) of this
      section (other than a person permanently debarred) or any person
      that is debarred under subsection (b) of this section may apply
      to the Secretary for termination of the debarment under this
      subsection. Any information submitted to the Secretary under this
      paragraph does not constitute an amendment or supplement to
      pending or approved abbreviated drug applications.
      (2) Deadline
        The Secretary shall grant or deny any application respecting a
      debarment which is submitted under paragraph (1) within 180 days
      of the date the application is submitted.
      (3) Action by the Secretary
        (A) Corporations
          (i) Conviction reversal
            If the conviction which served as the basis for the
          debarment of a person under subsection (a)(1) of this section
          or paragraph (2)(A) or (3) of subsection (b) of this section
          is reversed, the Secretary shall withdraw the order of
          debarment.
          (ii) Application
            Upon application submitted under paragraph (1), the
          Secretary shall terminate the debarment of a person if the
          Secretary finds that - 
              (I) changes in ownership, management, or operations have
            fully corrected the causes of the offense involved and
            provide reasonable assurances that the offense will not
            occur in the future, and
              (II) in applicable cases, sufficient audits, conducted by
            the Food and Drug Administration or by independent experts
            acceptable to the Food and Drug Administration, demonstrate
            that pending applications and the development of drugs
            being tested before the submission of an application are
            free of fraud or material false statements.

          In the case of persons debarred under subsection (a)(1) of
          this section, such termination shall take effect no earlier
          than the expiration of one year from the date of the
          debarment.
        (B) Individuals
          (i) Conviction reversal
            If the conviction which served as the basis for the
          debarment of an individual under subsection (a)(2) of this
          section or clause (i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) of subsection
          (b)(2)(B) or subsection (b)(3) of this section is reversed,
          the Secretary shall withdraw the order of debarment.
          (ii) Application
            Upon application submitted under paragraph (1), the
          Secretary shall terminate the debarment of an individual who
          has been debarred under subsection (b)(2)(B) or subsection
          (b)(3) of this section if such termination serves the
          interests of justice and adequately protects the integrity of
          the drug approval process or the food importation process, as
          the case may be.
      (4) Special termination
        (A) Application
          Any person that is debarred under subsection (a)(1) of this
        section (other than a person permanently debarred under
        subsection (c)(2)(A)(i) of this section) or any individual who
        is debarred under subsection (a)(2) of this section may apply
        to the Secretary for special termination of debarment under
        this subsection. Any information submitted to the Secretary
        under this subparagraph does not constitute an amendment or
        supplement to pending or approved abbreviated drug
        applications.
        (B) Corporations
          Upon an application submitted under subparagraph (A), the
        Secretary may take the action described in subparagraph (D) if
        the Secretary, after an informal hearing, finds that - 
            (i) the person making the application under subparagraph
          (A) has demonstrated that the felony conviction which was the
          basis for such person's debarment involved the commission of
          an offense which was not authorized, requested, commanded,
          performed, or recklessly tolerated by the board of directors
          or by a high managerial agent acting on behalf of the person
          within the scope of the board's or agent's office or
          employment,
            (ii) all individuals who were involved in the commission of
          the offense or who knew or should have known of the offense
          have been removed from employment involving the development
          or approval of any drug subject to sections (!1) 355 of this
          title,

            (iii) the person fully cooperated with all investigations
          and promptly disclosed all wrongdoing to the appropriate
          authorities, and
            (iv) the person acted to mitigate any impact on the public
          of any offense involved, including the recall, or the
          discontinuation of the distribution, of any drug with respect
          to which the Secretary requested a recall or discontinuation
          of distribution due to concerns about the safety or efficacy
          of the drug.
        (C) Individuals
          Upon an application submitted under subparagraph (A), the
        Secretary may take the action described in subparagraph (D) if
        the Secretary, after an informal hearing, finds that such
        individual has provided substantial assistance in the
        investigations or prosecutions of offenses which are described
        in subsection (a) or (b) of this section or which relate to any
        matter under the jurisdiction of the Food and Drug
        Administration.
        (D) Secretarial action
          The action referred to in subparagraphs (B) and (C) is - 
            (i) in the case of a person other than an individual - 
              (I) terminating the debarment immediately, or
              (II) limiting the period of debarment to less than one
            year, and

            (ii) in the case of an individual, limiting the period of
          debarment to less than permanent but to no less than 1 year,

        whichever best serves the interest of justice and protects the
        integrity of the drug approval process.
    (e) Publication and list of debarred persons
      The Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register the name of
    any person debarred under subsection (a) or (b) of this section,
    the effective date of the debarment, and the period of the
    debarment. The Secretary shall also maintain and make available to
    the public a list, updated no less often than quarterly, of such
    persons, of the effective dates and minimum periods of such
    debarments, and of the termination of debarments.
    (f) Temporary denial of approval
      (1) In general
        The Secretary, on the Secretary's own initiative or in response
      to a petition, may, in accordance with paragraph (3), refuse by
      order, for the period prescribed by paragraph (2), to approve any
      abbreviated drug application submitted by any person - 
          (A) if such person is under an active Federal criminal
        investigation in connection with an action described in
        subparagraph (B),
          (B) if the Secretary finds that such person - 
            (i) has bribed or attempted to bribe, has paid or attempted
          to pay an illegal gratuity, or has induced or attempted to
          induce another person to bribe or pay an illegal gratuity to
          any officer, employee, or agent of the Department of Health
          and Human Services or to any other Federal, State, or local
          official in connection with any abbreviated drug application,
          or has conspired to commit, or aided or abetted, such
          actions, or
            (ii) has knowingly made or caused to be made a pattern or
          practice of false statements or misrepresentations with
          respect to material facts relating to any abbreviated drug
          application, or the production of any drug subject to an
          abbreviated drug application, to any officer, employee, or
          agent of the Department of Health and Human Services, or has
          conspired to commit, or aided or abetted, such actions, and

          (C) if a significant question has been raised regarding - 
            (i) the integrity of the approval process with respect to
          such abbreviated drug application, or
            (ii) the reliability of data in or concerning such person's
          abbreviated drug application.

      Such an order may be modified or terminated at any time.
      (2) Applicable period
        (A) In general
          Except as provided in subparagraph (B), a denial of approval
        of an application of a person under paragraph (1) shall be in
        effect for a period determined by the Secretary but not to
        exceed 18 months beginning on the date the Secretary finds that
        the conditions described in subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of
        paragraph (1) exist. The Secretary shall terminate such denial -
         
            (i) if the investigation with respect to which the finding
          was made does not result in a criminal charge against such
          person, if criminal charges have been brought and the charges
          have been dismissed, or if a judgment of acquittal has been
          entered, or
            (ii) if the Secretary determines that such finding was in
          error.
        (B) Extension
          If, at the end of the period described in subparagraph (A),
        the Secretary determines that a person has been criminally
        charged for an action described in subparagraph (B) of
        paragraph (1), the Secretary may extend the period of denial of
        approval of an application for a period not to exceed 18
        months. The Secretary shall terminate such extension if the
        charges have been dismissed, if a judgment of acquittal has
        been entered, or if the Secretary determines that the finding
        described in subparagraph (A) was in error.
      (3) Informal hearing
        Within 10 days of the date an order is issued under paragraph
      (1), the Secretary shall provide such person with an opportunity
      for an informal hearing, to be held within such 10 days, on the
      decision of the Secretary to refuse approval of an abbreviated
      drug application. Within 60 days of the date on which such
      hearing is held, the Secretary shall notify the person given such
      hearing whether the Secretary's refusal of approval will be
      continued, terminated, or otherwise modified. Such notification
      shall be final agency action.
    (g) Suspension authority
      (1) In general
        If - 
          (A) the Secretary finds - 
            (i) that a person has engaged in conduct described in
          subparagraph (B) of subsection (f)(1) of this section in
          connection with 2 or more drugs under abbreviated drug
          applications, or
            (ii) that a person has engaged in flagrant and repeated,
          material violations of good manufacturing practice or good
          laboratory practice in connection with the development,
          manufacturing, or distribution of one or more drugs approved
          under an abbreviated drug application during a 2-year period,
          and - 
              (I) such violations may undermine the safety and efficacy
            of such drugs, and
              (II) the causes of such violations have not been
            corrected within a reasonable period of time following
            notice of such violations by the Secretary, and

          (B) such person is under an active investigation by a Federal
        authority in connection with a civil or criminal action
        involving conduct described in subparagraph (A),

      the Secretary shall issue an order suspending the distribution of
      all drugs the development or approval of which was related to
      such conduct described in subparagraph (A) or suspending the
      distribution of all drugs approved under abbreviated drug
      applications of such person if the Secretary finds that such
      conduct may have affected the development or approval of a
      significant number of drugs which the Secretary is unable to
      identify. The Secretary shall exclude a drug from such order if
      the Secretary determines that such conduct was not likely to have
      influenced the safety or efficacy of such drug.
      (2) Public health waiver
        The Secretary shall, on the Secretary's own initiative or in
      response to a petition, waive the suspension under paragraph (1)
      (involving an action described in paragraph (1)(A)(i)) with
      respect to any drug if the Secretary finds that such waiver is
      necessary to protect the public health because sufficient
      quantities of the drug would not otherwise be available. The
      Secretary shall act on any petition seeking action under this
      paragraph within 180 days of the date the petition is submitted
      to the Secretary.
    (h) Termination of suspension
      The Secretary shall withdraw an order of suspension of the
    distribution of a drug under subsection (g) of this section if the
    person with respect to whom the order was issued demonstrates in a
    petition to the Secretary - 
        (1)(A) on the basis of an audit by the Food and Drug
      Administration or by experts acceptable to the Food and Drug
      Administration, or on the basis of other information, that the
      development, approval, manufacturing, and distribution of such
      drug is in substantial compliance with the applicable
      requirements of this chapter, and
        (B) changes in ownership, management, or operations - 
          (i) fully remedy the patterns or practices with respect to
        which the order was issued, and
          (ii) provide reasonable assurances that such actions will not
        occur in the future, or

        (2) the initial determination was in error.

    The Secretary shall act on a submission of a petition under this
    subsection within 180 days of the date of its submission and the
    Secretary may consider the petition concurrently with the
    suspension proceeding. Any information submitted to the Secretary
    under this subsection does not constitute an amendment or
    supplement to a pending or approved abbreviated drug application.
    (i) Procedure
      The Secretary may not take any action under subsection (a), (b),
    (c), (d)(3), (g), or (h) of this section with respect to any person
    unless the Secretary has issued an order for such action made on
    the record after opportunity for an agency hearing on disputed
    issues of material fact. In the course of any investigation or
    hearing under this subsection, the Secretary may administer oaths
    and affirmations, examine witnesses, receive evidence, and issue
    subpoenas requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and
    the production of evidence that relates to the matter under
    investigation.
    (j) Judicial review
      (1) In general
        Except as provided in paragraph (2), any person that is the
      subject of an adverse decision under subsection (a), (b), (c),

      decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the District
      of Columbia or for the circuit in which the person resides, by

      obtain a review of such decision by the United States District
      Court for the District of Columbia or a district court of the
      United States for the district in which the person resides, by
      filing in such court (within 30 days following the date the
      person is notified of the Secretary's decision) a complaint
      requesting that the decision be modified or set aside. In such an
      action, the court shall determine the matter de novo.

    shall be liable to the United States for a civil penalty for each
    such violation in an amount not to exceed $250,000 in the case of
    an individual and $1,000,000 in the case of any other person.
    (b) Procedure
      (1) In general
        (A) Action by the Secretary
          A civil penalty under subsection (a) of this section shall be
        assessed by the Secretary on a person by an order made on the
        record after an opportunity for an agency hearing on disputed
        issues of material fact and the amount of the penalty. In the
        course of any investigation or hearing under this subparagraph,
        the Secretary may administer oaths and affirmations, examine
        witnesses, receive evidence, and issue subpoenas requiring the
        attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of
        evidence that relates to the matter under investigation.
        (B) Action by the Attorney General
          In lieu of a proceeding under subparagraph (A), the Attorney
        General may, upon request of the Secretary, institute a civil
        action to recover a civil money penalty in the amount and for
        any of the acts set forth in subsection (a) of this section.
        Such an action may be instituted separately from or in
        connection with any other claim, civil or criminal, initiated
        by the Attorney General under this chapter.
      (2) Amount
        In determining the amount of a civil penalty under paragraph
      (1), the Secretary or the court shall take into account the
      nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the act subject to
      penalty, the person's ability to pay, the effect on the person's
      ability to continue to do business, any history of prior, similar
      acts, and such other matters as justice may require.
      (3) Limitation on actions
        No action may be initiated under this section - 
          (A) with respect to any act described in subsection (a) of
        this section that occurred before May 13, 1992, or
          (B) more than 6 years after the date when facts material to
        the act are known or reasonably should have been known by the
        Secretary but in no event more than 10 years after the date the
        act took place.
    (c) Judicial review
      Any person that is the subject of an adverse decision under
    subsection (b)(1)(A) of this section may obtain a review of such
    decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of
    Columbia or for the circuit in which the person resides, by filing
    in such court (within 60 days following the date the person is
    notified of the Secretary's decision) a petition requesting that
    the decision be modified or set aside.
    (d) Recovery of penalties
      The Attorney General may recover any civil penalty (plus interest
    at the currently prevailing rates from the date the penalty became
    final) assessed under subsection (b)(1)(A) of this section in an
    action brought in the name of the United States. The amount of such
    penalty may be deducted, when the penalty has become final, from
    any sums then or later owing by the United States to the person
    against whom the penalty has been assessed. In an action brought
    under this subsection, the validity, amount, and appropriateness of
    the penalty shall not be subject to judicial review.
    (e) Informants
      The Secretary may award to any individual (other than an officer
    or employee of the Federal Government or a person who materially
    participated in any conduct described in subsection (a) of this
    section) who provides information leading to the imposition of a
    civil penalty under this section an amount not to exceed - 
        (1) $250,000, or
        (2) one-half of the penalty so imposed and collected,

    whichever is less. The decision of the Secretary on such award
    shall not be reviewable.

      gratuity, or fraud or material false statement, and
        (2) may withdraw approval of an abbreviated drug application if

-STATUTE-
      Whenever in the judgment of the Secretary such action will
    promote honesty and fair dealing in the interest of consumers, he
    shall promulgate regulations fixing and establishing for any food,
    under its common or usual name so far as practicable, a reasonable
    definition and standard of identity, a reasonable standard of
    quality, or reasonable standards of fill of container. No
    definition and standard of identity and no standard of quality
    shall be established for fresh or dried fruits, fresh or dried
    vegetables, or butter, except that definitions and standards of
    identity may be established for avocadoes, cantaloupes, citrus
    fruits, and melons. In prescribing any standard of fill of
    container, the Secretary shall give due consideration to the
    natural shrinkage in storage and in transit of fresh natural food
    and to need for the necessary packing and protective material. In
    the prescribing of any standard of quality for any canned fruit or
    canned vegetable, consideration shall be given and due allowance
    made for the differing characteristics of the several varieties of
    such fruit or vegetable. In prescribing a definition and standard
    of identity for any food or class of food in which optional
    ingredients are permitted, the Secretary shall, for the purpose of
    promoting honesty and fair dealing in the interest of consumers,
    designate the optional ingredients which shall be named on the
    label. Any definition and standard of identity prescribed by the
    Secretary for avocadoes, cantaloupes, citrus fruits, or melons
    shall relate only to maturity and to the effects of freezing.

      Ex. Ord. No. 13100, Aug. 25, 1998, 63 F.R. 45661, as amended by
    Ex. Ord. No. 13286, Sec. 16, Feb. 28, 2003, 68 F.R. 10623,
    provided:
      By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution
    and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to
    improve the safety of the food supply through science-based
    regulation and well-coordinated inspection, enforcement, research,
    and education programs, it is hereby ordered as follows:
      Section 1. Establishment of President's Council on Food Safety.
    (a) There is established the President's Council on Food Safety
    ("Council"). The Council shall comprise the Secretaries of
    Agriculture, Commerce, Health and Human Services, and Homeland
    Security, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget
    (OMB), the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency,
    the Assistant to the President for Science and Technology/Director
    of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Assistant to
    the President for Domestic Policy, and the Director of the National
    Partnership for Reinventing Government. The Council shall consult
    with other Federal agencies and State, local, and tribal government
    agencies, and consumer, producer, scientific, and industry groups,
    as appropriate.
      (b) The Secretaries of Agriculture and of Health and Human
    Services and the Assistant to the President for Science and
    Technology/Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy
    shall serve as Joint Chairs of the Council.
      Sec. 2. Purpose. The purpose of the Council shall be to develop a
    comprehensive strategic plan for Federal food safety activities,
    taking into consideration the findings and recommendations of the
    National Academy of Sciences report "Ensuring Safe Food from
    Production to Consumption" and other input from the public on how
    to improve the effectiveness of the current food safety system. The
    Council shall make recommendations to the President on how to
    advance Federal efforts to implement a comprehensive science-based
    strategy to improve the safety of the food supply and to enhance
    coordination among Federal agencies, State, local, and tribal
    governments, and the private sector. The Council shall advise
    Federal agencies in setting priority areas for investment in food
    safety.
      Sec. 3. Specific Activities and Functions. (a) The Council shall
    develop a comprehensive strategic Federal food safety plan that
    contains specific recommendations on needed changes, including
    measurable outcome goals. The principal goal of the plan should be
    the establishment of a seamless, science-based food safety system.
    The plan should address the steps necessary to achieve this goal,
    including the key public health, resource, and management issues
    regarding food safety. The planning process should consider both
    short-term and long-term issues including new and emerging threats
    and the special needs of vulnerable populations such as children
    and the elderly. In developing this plan, the Council shall consult
    with all interested parties, including State and local agencies,
    tribes, consumers, producers, industry, and academia.
      (b) Consistent with the comprehensive strategic Federal food
    safety plan described in section 3(a) of this order, the Council
    shall advise agencies of priority areas for investment in food
    safety and ensure that Federal agencies annually develop
    coordinated food safety budgets for submission to the OMB that
    sustain and strengthen existing capacities, eliminate duplication,
    and ensure the most effective use of resources for improving food
    safety. The Council shall also ensure that Federal agencies
    annually develop a unified budget for submission to the OMB for the
    President's Food Safety Initiative and such other food safety
    issues as the Council determines appropriate.
      (c) The Council shall ensure that the Joint Institute for Food
    Safety Research (JIFSR), in consultation with the National Science
    and Technology Council, establishes mechanisms to guide Federal
    research efforts toward the highest priority food safety needs. The
    JIFSR shall report to the Council on a regular basis on its
    efforts: (i) to develop a strategic plan for conducting food safety
    research activities consistent with the President's Food Safety
    Initiative and such other food safety activities as the JIFSR
    determines appropriate; and (ii) to coordinate efficiently, within
    the executive branch and with the private sector and academia, all
    Federal food safety research.
      Sec. 4. Cooperation. All actions taken by the Council shall, as
    appropriate, promote partnerships and cooperation with States,
    tribes, and other public and private sector efforts wherever
    possible to improve the safety of the food supply.
      Sec. 5. General Provisions. This order is intended only to
    improve the internal management of the executive branch and is not
    intended to, nor does it, create any right or benefit, substantive
    or procedural, enforceable at law by a party against the United
    States, its agencies, its officers or any person. Nothing in this
    order shall affect or alter the statutory responsibilities of any
    Federal agency charged with food safety responsibilities.

    this title] to such use or uses, or to develop the scientific data
    necessary for action under such section, was commenced by an
    interested person before March 6, 1960, and was thereafter pursued
    with reasonable diligence, and (ii) that in the Secretary's
    judgment such extension is consistent with the objective of
    carrying to completion in good faith, as soon as reasonably
    practicable, the scientific investigations necessary as a basis for
    action under such section 409 [section 348 of this title]:
    Provided, That if the Secretary has, pursuant to this sentence,
    granted an extension to June 30, 1964, he may, upon making the
    findings required by clause (1)(B) of this subsection and clauses

    but not beyond December 31, 1965. The Secretary may at any time
    terminate an extension so granted if he finds that it should not
    have been granted, or that by reason of a change in circumstances
    the basis for such extension no longer exists, or that there has
    been a failure to comply with a requirement for submission of
    progress reports or with other conditions attached to such
    extension."

      Pub. L. 104-180, title VII, Sec. 733, Aug. 6, 1996, 110 Stat.
    1601, provided that: "Hereafter, notwithstanding any other
    provision of law, any domestic fish or fish product produced in
    compliance with food safety standards or procedures accepted by the
    Food and Drug Administration as satisfying the requirements of the
    'Procedures for the Safe and Sanitary Processing and Importing of
    Fish and Fish Products' (published by the Food and Drug
    Administration as a final regulation in the Federal Register of
    December 18, 1995), shall be deemed to have met any inspection
    requirements of the Department of Agriculture or other Federal
    agency for any Federal commodity purchase program, including the
    program authorized under section 32 of the Act of August 24, 1935
    (7 U.S.C. 612c) except that the Department of Agriculture or other
    Federal agency may utilize lot inspection to establish a reasonable
    degree of certainty that fish or fish products purchased under a
    Federal commodity purchase program, including the program
    authorized under section 32 of the Act of August 24, 1935 (7 U.S.C.
    612c), meet Federal product specifications."

    Sec. 343. Misbranded food

-STATUTE-
      A food shall be deemed to be misbranded - 
    (a) False or misleading label
      If (1) its labeling is false or misleading in any particular, or
    (2) in the case of a food to which section 350 of this title
    applies, its advertising is false or misleading in a material
    respect or its labeling is in violation of section 350(b)(2) of
    this title.
    (b) Offer for sale under another name
      If it is offered for sale under the name of another food.
    (c) Imitation of another food
      If it is an imitation of another food, unless its label bears, in
    type of uniform size and prominence, the word "imitation" and,
    immediately thereafter, the name of the food imitated.
    (d) Misleading container
      If its container is so made, formed, or filled as to be
    misleading.
    (e) Package form
      If in package form unless it bears a label containing (1) the
    name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or
    distributor; and (2) an accurate statement of the quantity of the
    contents in terms of weight, measure, or numerical count, except
    that under clause (2) of this paragraph reasonable variations shall
    be permitted, and exemptions as to small packages shall be
    established, by regulations prescribed by the Secretary.
    (f) Prominence of information on label
      If any word, statement, or other information required by or under
    authority of this chapter to appear on the label or labeling is not
    prominently placed thereon with such conspicuousness (as compared
    with other words, statements, designs, or devices, in the labeling)
    and in such terms as to render it likely to be read and understood
    by the ordinary individual under customary conditions of purchase
    and use.
    (g) Representation as to definition and standard of identity
      If it purports to be or is represented as a food for which a
    definition and standard of identity has been prescribed by
    regulations as provided by section 341 of this title, unless (1) it
    conforms to such definition and standard, and (2) its label bears
    the name of the food specified in the definition and standard, and,
    insofar as may be required by such regulations, the common names of
    optional ingredients (other than spices, flavoring, and coloring)
    present in such food.
    (h) Representation as to standards of quality and fill of container
      If it purports to be or is represented as - 
        (1) a food for which a standard of quality has been prescribed
      by regulations as provided by section 341 of this title, and its
      quality falls below such standard, unless its label bears, in
      such manner and form as such regulations specify, a statement
      that it falls below such standard;
        (2) a food for which a standard or standards of fill of
      container have been prescribed by regulations as provided by
      section 341 of this title, and it falls below the standard of
      fill of container applicable thereto, unless its label bears, in
      such manner and form as such regulations specify, a statement
      that it falls below such standard; or
        (3) a food that is pasteurized unless - 
          (A) such food has been subjected to a safe process or
        treatment that is prescribed as pasteurization for such food in
        a regulation promulgated under this chapter; or
          (B)(i) such food has been subjected to a safe process or
        treatment that - 
            (I) is reasonably certain to achieve destruction or
          elimination in the food of the most resistant microorganisms
          of public health significance that are likely to occur in the
          food;
            (II) is at least as protective of the public health as a
          process or treatment described in subparagraph (A);
            (III) is effective for a period that is at least as long as
          the shelf life of the food when stored under normal and
          moderate abuse conditions; and
            (IV) is the subject of a notification to the Secretary,
          including effectiveness data regarding the process or
          treatment; and

          (ii) at least 120 days have passed after the date of receipt
        of such notification by the Secretary without the Secretary
        making a determination that the process or treatment involved
        has not been shown to meet the requirements of subclauses (I)
        through (III) of clause (i).

    For purposes of paragraph (3), a determination by the Secretary
    that a process or treatment has not been shown to meet the
    requirements of subclauses (I) through (III) of subparagraph (B)(i)
    shall constitute final agency action under such subclauses.
    (i) Label where no representation as to definition and standard of
      identity
      Unless its label bears (1) the common or usual name of the food,
    if any there be, and (2) in case it is fabricated from two or more
    ingredients, the common or usual name of each such ingredient and
    if the food purports to be a beverage containing vegetable or fruit
    juice, a statement with appropriate prominence on the information
    panel of the total percentage of such fruit or vegetable juice
    contained in the food; except that spices, flavorings, and colors
    not required to be certified under section 379e(c) of this title
    (!1) unless sold as spices, flavorings, or such colors, may be
    designated as spices, flavorings, and colorings without naming
    each. To the extent that compliance with the requirements of clause
    (2) of this paragraph is impracticable, or results in deception or
    unfair competition, exemptions shall be established by regulations
    promulgated by the Secretary.

    (j) Representation for special dietary use
      If it purports to be or is represented for special dietary uses,
    unless its label bears such information concerning its vitamin,
    mineral, and other dietary properties as the Secretary determines
    to be, and by regulations prescribes as, necessary in order fully
    to inform purchasers as to its value for such uses.
    (k) Artificial flavoring, artificial coloring, or chemical
      preservatives
      If it bears or contains any artificial flavoring, artificial
    coloring, or chemical preservative, unless it bears labeling
    stating that fact, except that to the extent that compliance with
    the requirements of this paragraph is impracticable, exemptions
    shall be established by regulations promulgated by the Secretary.
    The provisions of this paragraph and paragraphs (g) and (i) with
    respect to artificial coloring shall not apply in the case of
    butter, cheese, or ice cream. The provisions of this paragraph with
    respect to chemical preservatives shall not apply to a pesticide
    chemical when used in or on a raw agricultural commodity which is
    the produce of the soil.
    (l) Pesticide chemicals on raw agricultural commodities
      If it is a raw agricultural commodity which is the produce of the
    soil, bearing or containing a pesticide chemical applied after
    harvest, unless the shipping container of such commodity bears
    labeling which declares the presence of such chemical in or on such
    commodity and the common or usual name and the function of such
    chemical, except that no such declaration shall be required while
    such commodity, having been removed from the shipping container, is
    being held or displayed for sale at retail out of such container in
    accordance with the custom of the trade.
    (m) Color additives
      If it is a color additive, unless its packaging and labeling are
    in conformity with such packaging and labeling requirements,
    applicable to such color additive, as may be contained in
    regulations issued under section 379e of this title.
    (n) Packaging or labeling of drugs in violation of regulations
      If its packaging or labeling is in violation of an applicable
    regulation issued pursuant to section 1472 or 1473 of title 15.
    (o) Repealed. Pub. L. 106-554, Sec. 1(a)(1) [title V, Sec. 517],
      Dec. 21, 2000, 114 Stat. 2763, 2763A-73
    (p) Repealed. Pub. L. 104-124, Sec. 1, Apr. 1, 1996, 110 Stat. 882
    (q) Nutrition information
      (1) Except as provided in subparagraphs (3), (4), and (5), if it
    is a food intended for human consumption and is offered for sale,
    unless its label or labeling bears nutrition information that
    provides - 
        (A)(i) the serving size which is an amount customarily consumed
      and which is expressed in a common household measure that is
      appropriate to the food, or
        (ii) if the use of the food is not typically expressed in a
      serving size, the common household unit of measure that expresses
      the serving size of the food,
        (B) the number of servings or other units of measure per
      container,
        (C) the total number of calories - 
          (i) derived from any source, and
          (ii) derived from the total fat,

      in each serving size or other unit of measure of the food,
        (D) the amount of the following nutrients: Total fat, saturated
      fat, cholesterol, sodium, total carbohydrates, complex
      carbohydrates, sugars, dietary fiber, and total protein contained
      in each serving size or other unit of measure,
        (E) any vitamin, mineral, or other nutrient required to be
      placed on the label and labeling of food under this chapter
      before October 1, 1990, if the Secretary determines that such
      information will assist consumers in maintaining healthy dietary
      practices.

    The Secretary may by regulation require any information required to
    be placed on the label or labeling by this subparagraph or
    subparagraph (2)(A) to be highlighted on the label or labeling by
    larger type, bold type, or contrasting color if the Secretary
    determines that such highlighting will assist consumers in
    maintaining healthy dietary practices.
      (2)(A) If the Secretary determines that a nutrient other than a
    nutrient required by subparagraph (1)(C), (1)(D), or (1)(E) should
    be included in the label or labeling of food subject to
    subparagraph (1) for purposes of providing information regarding
    the nutritional value of such food that will assist consumers in
    maintaining healthy dietary practices, the Secretary may by
    regulation require that information relating to such additional
    nutrient be included in the label or labeling of such food.
      (B) If the Secretary determines that the information relating to
    a nutrient required by subparagraph (1)(C), (1)(D), or (1)(E) or
    clause (A) of this subparagraph to be included in the label or
    labeling of food is not necessary to assist consumers in
    maintaining healthy dietary practices, the Secretary may by
    regulation remove information relating to such nutrient from such
    requirement.
      (3) For food that is received in bulk containers at a retail
    establishment, the Secretary may, by regulation, provide that the
    nutrition information required by subparagraphs (1) and (2) be
    displayed at the location in the retail establishment at which the
    food is offered for sale.
      (4)(A) The Secretary shall provide for furnishing the nutrition
    information required by subparagraphs (1) and (2) with respect to
    raw agricultural commodities and raw fish by issuing voluntary
    nutrition guidelines, as provided by clause (B) or by issuing
    regulations that are mandatory as provided by clause (D).
      (B)(i) Upon the expiration of 12 months after November 8, 1990,
    the Secretary, after providing an opportunity for comment, shall
    issue guidelines for food retailers offering raw agricultural
    commodities or raw fish to provide nutrition information specified
    in subparagraphs (1) and (2). Such guidelines shall take into
    account the actions taken by food retailers during such 12-month
    period to provide to consumers nutrition information on raw
    agricultural commodities and raw fish. Such guidelines shall only
    apply - 
        (I) in the case of raw agricultural commodities, to the 20
      varieties of vegetables most frequently consumed during a year
      and the 20 varieties of fruit most frequently consumed during a
      year, and
        (II) to the 20 varieties of raw fish most frequently consumed
      during a year.

    The vegetables, fruits, and raw fish to which such guidelines apply
    shall be determined by the Secretary by regulation and the
    Secretary may apply such guidelines regionally.
      (ii) Upon the expiration of 12 months after November 8, 1990, the
    Secretary shall issue a final regulation defining the circumstances
    that constitute substantial compliance by food retailers with the
    guidelines issued under subclause (i). The regulation shall provide
    that there is not substantial compliance if a significant number of
    retailers have failed to comply with the guidelines. The size of
    the retailers and the portion of the market served by retailers in
    compliance with the guidelines shall be considered in determining
    whether the substantial-compliance standard has been met.
      (C)(i) Upon the expiration of 30 months after November 8, 1990,
    the Secretary shall issue a report on actions taken by food
    retailers to provide consumers with nutrition information for raw
    agricultural commodities and raw fish under the guidelines issued
    under clause (A). Such report shall include a determination of
    whether there is substantial compliance with the guidelines.
      (ii) If the Secretary finds that there is substantial compliance
    with the guidelines, the Secretary shall issue a report and make a
    determination of the type required in subclause (i) every two
    years.
      (D)(i) If the Secretary determines that there is not substantial
    compliance with the guidelines issued under clause (A), the
    Secretary shall at the time such determination is made issue
    proposed regulations requiring that any person who offers raw
    agricultural commodities or raw fish to consumers provide, in a
    manner prescribed by regulations, the nutrition information
    required by subparagraphs (1) and (2). The Secretary shall issue
    final regulations imposing such requirements 6 months after issuing
    the proposed regulations. The final regulations shall become
    effective 6 months after the date of their promulgation.
      (ii) Regulations issued under subclause (i) may require that the
    nutrition information required by subparagraphs (1) and (2) be
    provided for more than 20 varieties of vegetables, 20 varieties of
    fruit, and 20 varieties of fish most frequently consumed during a
    year if the Secretary finds that a larger number of such products
    are frequently consumed. Such regulations shall permit such
    information to be provided in a single location in each area in
    which raw agricultural commodities and raw fish are offered for
    sale. Such regulations may provide that information shall be
    expressed as an average or range per serving of the same type of
    raw agricultural commodity or raw fish. The Secretary shall develop
    and make available to the persons who offer such food to consumers
    the information required by subparagraphs (1) and (2).
      (iii) Regulations issued under subclause (i) shall permit the
    required information to be provided in each area of an
    establishment in which raw agricultural commodities and raw fish
    are offered for sale. The regulations shall permit food retailers
    to display the required information by supplying copies of the
    information provided by the Secretary, by making the information
    available in brochure, notebook or leaflet form, or by posting a
    sign disclosing the information. Such regulations shall also permit
    presentation of the required information to be supplemented by a
    video, live demonstration, or other media which the Secretary
    approves.
      (E) For purposes of this subparagraph, the term "fish" includes
    freshwater or marine fin fish, crustaceans, and mollusks, including
    shellfish, amphibians, and other forms of aquatic animal life.
      (F) No person who offers raw agricultural commodities or raw fish
    to consumers may be prosecuted for minor violations of this
    subparagraph if there has been substantial compliance with the
    requirements of this paragraph.
      (5)(A) Subparagraphs (1), (2), (3), and (4) shall not apply to
    food - 
        (i) which is served in restaurants or other establishments in
      which food is served for immediate human consumption or which is
      sold for sale or use in such establishments,
        (ii) which is processed and prepared primarily in a retail
      establishment, which is ready for human consumption, which is of
      the type described in subclause (i), and which is offered for
      sale to consumers but not for immediate human consumption in such
      establishment and which is not offered for sale outside such
      establishment,
        (iii) which is an infant formula subject to section 350a of
      this title,
        (iv) which is a medical food as defined in section 360ee(b) of
      this title, or
        (v) which is described in section 345(2) of this title.

      (B) Subparagraphs (1) and (2) shall not apply to the label of a
    food if the Secretary determines by regulations that compliance
    with such subparagraphs is impracticable because the package of
    such food is too small to comply with the requirements of such
    subparagraphs and if the label of such food does not contain any
    nutrition information.
      (C) If a food contains insignificant amounts, as determined by
    the Secretary, of all the nutrients required by subparagraphs (1)
    and (2) to be listed in the label or labeling of food, the
    requirements of such subparagraphs shall not apply to such food if
    the label, labeling, or advertising of such food does not make any
    claim with respect to the nutritional value of such food. If a food
    contains insignificant amounts, as determined by the Secretary, of
    more than one-half the nutrients required by subparagraphs (1) and
    (2) to be in the label or labeling of the food, the Secretary shall
    require the amounts of such nutrients to be stated in a simplified
    form prescribed by the Secretary.
      (D) If a person offers food for sale and has annual gross sales
    made or business done in sales to consumers which is not more than
    $500,000 or has annual gross sales made or business done in sales
    of food to consumers which is not more than $50,000, the
    requirements of subparagraphs (1), (2), (3), and (4) shall not
    apply with respect to food sold by such person to consumers unless
    the label or labeling of food offered by such person provides
    nutrition information or makes a nutrition claim.
      (E)(i) During the 12-month period for which an exemption from
    subparagraphs (1) and (2) is claimed pursuant to this subclause,
    the requirements of such subparagraphs shall not apply to any food
    product if - 
        (I) the labeling for such product does not provide nutrition
      information or make a claim subject to paragraph (r),
        (II) the person who claims for such product an exemption from
      such subparagraphs employed fewer than an average of 100 full-
      time equivalent employees,
        (III) such person provided the notice described in subclause
      (iii), and
        (IV) in the case of a food product which was sold in the 12-
      month period preceding the period for which an exemption was
      claimed, fewer than 100,000 units of such product were sold in
      the United States during such preceding period, or in the case of
      a food product which was not sold in the 12-month period
      preceding the period for which such exemption is claimed, fewer
      than 100,000 units of such product are reasonably anticipated to
      be sold in the United States during the period for which such
      exemption is claimed.

      (ii) During the 12-month period after the applicable date
    referred to in this sentence, the requirements of subparagraphs (1)
    and (2) shall not apply to any food product which was first
    introduced into interstate commerce before May 8, 1994, if the
    labeling for such product does not provide nutrition information or
    make a claim subject to paragraph (r), if such person provided the
    notice described in subclause (iii), and if - 
        (I) during the 12-month period preceding May 8, 1994, the
      person who claims for such product an exemption from such
      subparagraphs employed fewer than an average of 300 full-time
      equivalent employees and fewer than 600,000 units of such product
      were sold in the United States,
        (II) during the 12-month period preceding May 8, 1995, the
      person who claims for such product an exemption from such
      subparagraphs employed fewer than an average of 300 full-time
      equivalent employees and fewer than 400,000 units of such product
      were sold in the United States, or
        (III) during the 12-month period preceding May 8, 1996, the
      person who claims for such product an exemption from such
      subparagraphs employed fewer than an average of 200 full-time
      equivalent employees and fewer than 200,000 units of such product
      were sold in the United States.

      (iii) The notice referred to in subclauses (i) and (ii) shall be
    given to the Secretary prior to the beginning of the period during
    which the exemption under subclause (i) or (ii) is to be in effect,
    shall state that the person claiming such exemption for a food
    product has complied with the applicable requirements of subclause
    (i) or (ii), and shall - 
        (I) state the average number of full-time equivalent employees
      such person employed during the 12 months preceding the date such
      person claims such exemption,
        (II) state the approximate number of units the person claiming
      the exemption sold in the United States,
        (III) if the exemption is claimed for a food product which was
      sold in the 12-month period preceding the period for which the
      exemption was claimed, state the approximate number of units of
      such product which were sold in the United States during such
      preceding period, and, if the exemption is claimed for a food
      product which was not sold in such preceding period, state the
      number of units of such product which such person reasonably
      anticipates will be sold in the United States during the period
      for which the exemption was claimed, and
        (IV) contain such information as the Secretary may require to
      verify the information required by the preceding provisions of
      this subclause if the Secretary has questioned the validity of
      such information.

    If a person is not an importer, has fewer than 10 full-time
    equivalent employees, and sells fewer than 10,000 units of any food
    product in any year, such person is not required to file a notice
    for such product under this subclause for such year.
      (iv) In the case of a person who claimed an exemption under
    subclause (i) or (ii), if, during the period of such exemption, the
    number of full-time equivalent employees of such person exceeds the
    number in such subclause or if the number of food products sold in
    the United States exceeds the number in such subclause, such
    exemption shall extend to the expiration of 18 months after the
    date the number of full-time equivalent employees or food products
    sold exceeded the applicable number.
      (v) For any food product first introduced into interstate
    commerce after May 8, 2002, the Secretary may by regulation lower
    the employee or units of food products requirement of subclause (i)
    if the Secretary determines that the cost of compliance with such
    lower requirement will not place an undue burden on persons subject
    to such lower requirement.
      (vi) For purposes of subclauses (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), and (v) -
    
        (I) the term "unit" means the packaging or, if there is no
      packaging, the form in which a food product is offered for sale
      to consumers,
        (II) the term "food product" means food in any sized package
      which is manufactured by a single manufacturer or which bears the
      same brand name, which bears the same statement of identity, and
      which has similar preparation methods, and
        (III) the term "person" in the case of a corporation includes
      all domestic and foreign affiliates of the corporation.

      (F) A dietary supplement product (including a food to which
    section 350 of this title applies) shall comply with the
    requirements of subparagraphs (1) and (2) in a manner which is
    appropriate for the product and which is specified in regulations
    of the Secretary which shall provide that - 
        (i) nutrition information shall first list those dietary
      ingredients that are present in the product in a significant
      amount and for which a recommendation for daily consumption has
      been established by the Secretary, except that a dietary
      ingredient shall not be required to be listed if it is not
      present in a significant amount, and shall list any other dietary
      ingredient present and identified as having no such
      recommendation;
        (ii) the listing of dietary ingredients shall include the
      quantity of each such ingredient (or of a proprietary blend of
      such ingredients) per serving;
        (iii) the listing of dietary ingredients may include the source
      of a dietary ingredient; and
        (iv) the nutrition information shall immediately precede the
      ingredient information required under subclause (i), except that
      no ingredient identified pursuant to subclause (i) shall be
      required to be identified a second time.

      (G) Subparagraphs (1), (2), (3), and (4) shall not apply to food
    which is sold by a food distributor if the food distributor
    principally sells food to restaurants or other establishments in
    which food is served for immediate human consumption and does not
    manufacture, process, or repackage the food it sells.
    (r) Nutrition levels and health-related claims
      (1) Except as provided in clauses (A) through (C) of subparagraph
    (5), if it is a food intended for human consumption which is
    offered for sale and for which a claim is made in the label or
    labeling of the food which expressly or by implication - 
        (A) characterizes the level of any nutrient which is of the
      type required by paragraph (q)(1) or (q)(2) to be in the label or
      labeling of the food unless the claim is made in accordance with
      subparagraph (2), or
        (B) characterizes the relationship of any nutrient which is of
      the type required by paragraph (q)(1) or (q)(2) to be in the
      label or labeling of the food to a disease or a health-related
      condition unless the claim is made in accordance with
      subparagraph (3) or (5)(D).

    A statement of the type required by paragraph (q) that appears as
    part of the nutrition information required or permitted by such
    paragraph is not a claim which is subject to this paragraph and a
    claim subject to clause (A) is not subject to clause (B).
      (2)(A) Except as provided in subparagraphs (4)(A)(ii) and
    (4)(A)(iii) and clauses (A) through (C) of subparagraph (5), a
    claim described in subparagraph (1)(A) - 
        (i) may be made only if the characterization of the level made
      in the claim uses terms which are defined in regulations of the
      Secretary,
        (ii) may not state the absence of a nutrient unless - 
          (I) the nutrient is usually present in the food or in a food
        which substitutes for the food as defined by the Secretary by
        regulation, or
          (II) the Secretary by regulation permits such a statement on
        the basis of a finding that such a statement would assist
        consumers in maintaining healthy dietary practices and the
        statement discloses that the nutrient is not usually present in
        the food,

        (iii) may not be made with respect to the level of cholesterol
      in the food if the food contains, as determined by the Secretary
      by regulation, fat or saturated fat in an amount which increases
      to persons in the general population the risk of disease or a
      health related condition which is diet related unless - 
          (I) the Secretary finds by regulation that the level of
        cholesterol is substantially less than the level usually
        present in the food or in a food which substitutes for the food
        and which has a significant market share, or the Secretary by
        regulation permits a statement regarding the absence of
        cholesterol on the basis of a finding that cholesterol is not
        usually present in the food and that such a statement would
        assist consumers in maintaining healthy dietary practices and
        the regulation requires that the statement disclose that
        cholesterol is not usually present in the food, and
          (II) the label or labeling of the food discloses the level of
        such fat or saturated fat in immediate proximity to such claim
        and with appropriate prominence which shall be no less than one-
        half the size of the claim with respect to the level of
        cholesterol,

        (iv) may not be made with respect to the level of saturated fat
      in the food if the food contains cholesterol unless the label or
      labeling of the food discloses the level of cholesterol in the
      food in immediate proximity to such claim and with appropriate
      prominence which shall be no less than one-half the size of the
      claim with respect to the level of saturated fat,
        (v) may not state that a food is high in dietary fiber unless
      the food is low in total fat as defined by the Secretary or the
      label or labeling discloses the level of total fat in the food in
      immediate proximity to such statement and with appropriate
      prominence which shall be no less than one-half the size of the
      claim with respect to the level of dietary fiber, and
        (vi) may not be made if the Secretary by regulation prohibits
      the claim because the claim is misleading in light of the level
      of another nutrient in the food.

      (B) If a claim described in subparagraph (1)(A) is made with
    respect to a nutrient in a food and the Secretary makes a
    determination that the food contains a nutrient at a level that
    increases to persons in the general population the risk of a
    disease or health-related condition that is diet related, the label
    or labeling of such food shall contain, prominently and in
    immediate proximity to such claim, the following statement: "See
    nutrition information for ___ content." The blank shall identify
    the nutrient associated with the increased disease or health-
    related condition risk. In making the determination described in
    this clause, the Secretary shall take into account the significance
    of the food in the total daily diet.
      (C) Subparagraph (2)(A) does not apply to a claim described in
    subparagraph (1)(A) and contained in the label or labeling of a
    food if such claim is contained in the brand name of such food and
    such brand name was in use on such food before October 25, 1989,
    unless the brand name contains a term defined by the Secretary
    under subparagraph (2)(A)(i). Such a claim is subject to paragraph
    (a).
      (D) Subparagraph (2) does not apply to a claim described in
    subparagraph (1)(A) which uses the term "diet" and is contained in
    the label or labeling of a soft drink if (i) such claim is
    contained in the brand name of such soft drink, (ii) such brand
    name was in use on such soft drink before October 25, 1989, and
    (iii) the use of the term "diet" was in conformity with section
    105.66 of title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Such a claim
    is subject to paragraph (a).
      (E) Subclauses (i) through (v) of subparagraph (2)(A) do not
    apply to a statement in the label or labeling of food which
    describes the percentage of vitamins and minerals in the food in
    relation to the amount of such vitamins and minerals recommended
    for daily consumption by the Secretary.
      (F) Subclause (i) clause (A) does not apply to a statement in the
    labeling of a dietary supplement that characterizes the percentage
    level of a dietary ingredient for which the Secretary has not
    established a reference daily intake, daily recommended value, or
    other recommendation for daily consumption.
      (G) A claim of the type described in subparagraph (1)(A) for a
    nutrient, for which the Secretary has not promulgated a regulation
    under clause (A)(i), shall be authorized and may be made with
    respect to a food if - 
        (i) a scientific body of the United States Government with
      official responsibility for public health protection or research
      directly relating to human nutrition (such as the National
      Institutes of Health or the Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention) or the National Academy of Sciences or any of its
      subdivisions has published an authoritative statement, which is
      currently in effect, which identifies the nutrient level to which
      the claim refers;
        (ii) a person has submitted to the Secretary, at least 120 days
      (during which the Secretary may notify any person who is making a
      claim as authorized by clause (C) that such person has not
      submitted all the information required by such clause) before the
      first introduction into interstate commerce of the food with a
      label containing the claim, (I) a notice of the claim, which
      shall include the exact words used in the claim and shall include
      a concise description of the basis upon which such person relied
      for determining that the requirements of subclause (i) have been
      satisfied, (II) a copy of the statement referred to in subclause
      (i) upon which such person relied in making the claim, and (III)
      a balanced representation of the scientific literature relating
      to the nutrient level to which the claim refers;
        (iii) the claim and the food for which the claim is made are in
      compliance with clauses (A) and (B), and are otherwise in
      compliance with paragraph (a) and section 321(n) of this title;
      and
        (iv) the claim is stated in a manner so that the claim is an
      accurate representation of the authoritative statement referred
      to in subclause (i) and so that the claim enables the public to
      comprehend the information provided in the claim and to
      understand the relative significance of such information in the
      context of a total daily diet.

    For purposes of this clause, a statement shall be regarded as an
    authoritative statement of a scientific body described in subclause
    (i) only if the statement is published by the scientific body and
    shall not include a statement of an employee of the scientific body
    made in the individual capacity of the employee.
      (H) A claim submitted under the requirements of clause (G) may be
    made until - 
        (i) such time as the Secretary issues a regulation - 
          (I) prohibiting or modifying the claim and the regulation has
        become effective, or
          (II) finding that the requirements of clause (G) have not
        been met, including finding that the petitioner had not
        submitted all the information required by such clause; or

        (ii) a district court of the United States in an enforcement
      proceeding under subchapter III of this chapter has determined
      that the requirements of clause (G) have not been met.

      (3)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (5), a claim described
    in subparagraph (1)(B) may only be made - 
        (i) if the claim meets the requirements of the regulations of
      the Secretary promulgated under clause (B), and
        (ii) if the food for which the claim is made does not contain,
      as determined by the Secretary by regulation, any nutrient in an
      amount which increases to persons in the general population the
      risk of a disease or health-related condition which is diet
      related, taking into account the significance of the food in the
      total daily diet, except that the Secretary may by regulation
      permit such a claim based on a finding that such a claim would
      assist consumers in maintaining healthy dietary practices and
      based on a requirement that the label contain a disclosure of the
      type required by subparagraph (2)(B).

      (B)(i) The Secretary shall promulgate regulations authorizing
    claims of the type described in subparagraph (1)(B) only if the
    Secretary determines, based on the totality of publicly available
    scientific evidence (including evidence from well-designed studies
    conducted in a manner which is consistent with generally recognized
    scientific procedures and principles), that there is significant
    scientific agreement, among experts qualified by scientific
    training and experience to evaluate such claims, that the claim is
    supported by such evidence.
      (ii) A regulation described in subclause (i) shall describe - 
        (I) the relationship between a nutrient of the type required in
      the label or labeling of food by paragraph (q)(1) or (q)(2) and a
      disease or health-related condition, and
        (II) the significance of each such nutrient in affecting such
      disease or health-related condition.

      (iii) A regulation described in subclause (i) shall require such
    claim to be stated in a manner so that the claim is an accurate
    representation of the matters set out in subclause (ii) and so that
    the claim enables the public to comprehend the information provided
    in the claim and to understand the relative significance of such
    information in the context of a total daily diet.
      (C) Notwithstanding the provisions of clauses (A)(i) and (B), a
    claim of the type described in subparagraph (1)(B) which is not
    authorized by the Secretary in a regulation promulgated in
    accordance with clause (B) shall be authorized and may be made with
    respect to a food if - 
        (i) a scientific body of the United States Government with
      official responsibility for public health protection or research
      directly relating to human nutrition (such as the National
      Institutes of Health or the Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention) or the National Academy of Sciences or any of its
      subdivisions has published an authoritative statement, which is
      currently in effect, about the relationship between a nutrient
      and a disease or health-related condition to which the claim
      refers;
        (ii) a person has submitted to the Secretary, at least 120 days
      (during which the Secretary may notify any person who is making a
      claim as authorized by clause (C) that such person has not
      submitted all the information required by such clause) before the
      first introduction into interstate commerce of the food with a
      label containing the claim, (I) a notice of the claim, which
      shall include the exact words used in the claim and shall include
      a concise description of the basis upon which such person relied
      for determining that the requirements of subclause (i) have been
      satisfied, (II) a copy of the statement referred to in subclause
      (i) upon which such person relied in making the claim, and (III)
      a balanced representation of the scientific literature relating
      to the relationship between a nutrient and a disease or health-
      related condition to which the claim refers;
        (iii) the claim and the food for which the claim is made are in
      compliance with clause (A)(ii) and are otherwise in compliance
      with paragraph (a) and section 321(n) of this title; and
        (iv) the claim is stated in a manner so that the claim is an
      accurate representation of the authoritative statement referred
      to in subclause (i) and so that the claim enables the public to
      comprehend the information provided in the claim and to
      understand the relative significance of such information in the
      context of a total daily diet.

    For purposes of this clause, a statement shall be regarded as an
    authoritative statement of a scientific body described in subclause
    (i) only if the statement is published by the scientific body and
    shall not include a statement of an employee of the scientific body
    made in the individual capacity of the employee.
      (D) A claim submitted under the requirements of clause (C) may be
    made until - 
        (i) such time as the Secretary issues a regulation under the
      standard in clause (B)(i) - 
          (I) prohibiting or modifying the claim and the regulation has
        become effective, or
          (II) finding that the requirements of clause (C) have not
        been met, including finding that the petitioner has not
        submitted all the information required by such clause; or

        (ii) a district court of the United States in an enforcement
      proceeding under subchapter III of this chapter has determined
      that the requirements of clause (C) have not been met.

      (4)(A)(i) Any person may petition the Secretary to issue a
    regulation under subparagraph (2)(A)(i) or (3)(B) relating to a
    claim described in subparagraph (1)(A) or (1)(B). Not later than
    100 days after the petition is received by the Secretary, the
    Secretary shall issue a final decision denying the petition or file
    the petition for further action by the Secretary. If the Secretary
    does not act within such 100 days, the petition shall be deemed to
    be denied unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the
    Secretary and the petitioner. If the Secretary denies the petition
    or the petition is deemed to be denied, the petition shall not be
    made available to the public. If the Secretary files the petition,
    the Secretary shall deny the petition or issue a proposed
    regulation to take the action requested in the petition not later
    than 90 days after the date of such decision. If the Secretary does
    not act within such 90 days, the petition shall be deemed to be
    denied unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the Secretary
    and the petitioner. If the Secretary issues a proposed regulation,
    the rulemaking shall be completed within 540 days of the date the
    petition is received by the Secretary. If the Secretary does not
    issue a regulation within such 540 days, the Secretary shall
    provide the Committee on Commerce of the House of Representatives
    and the Committee on Labor and Human Resources of the Senate the
    reasons action on the regulation did not occur within such 540
    days.
      (ii) Any person may petition the Secretary for permission to use
    in a claim described in subparagraph (1)(A) terms that are
    consistent with the terms defined by the Secretary under
    subparagraph (2)(A)(i). Within 90 days of the submission of such a
    petition, the Secretary shall issue a final decision denying the
    petition or granting such permission.
      (iii) Any person may petition the Secretary for permission to use
    an implied claim described in subparagraph (1)(A) in a brand name.
    After publishing notice of an opportunity to comment on the
    petition in the Federal Register and making the petition available
    to the public, the Secretary shall grant the petition if the
    Secretary finds that such claim is not misleading and is consistent
    with terms defined by the Secretary under subparagraph (2)(A)(i).
    The Secretary shall grant or deny the petition within 100 days of
    the date it is submitted to the Secretary and the petition shall be
    considered granted if the Secretary does not act on it within such
    100 days.
      (B) A petition under clause (A)(i) respecting a claim described
    in subparagraph (1)(A) or (1)(B) shall include an explanation of
    the reasons why the claim meets the requirements of this paragraph
    and a summary of the scientific data which supports such reasons.
      (C) If a petition for a regulation under subparagraph (3)(B)
    relies on a report from an authoritative scientific body of the
    United States, the Secretary shall consider such report and shall
    justify any decision rejecting the conclusions of such report.
      (5)(A) This paragraph does not apply to infant formulas subject
    to section 350a(h) of this title and medical foods as defined in
    section 360ee(b) of this title.
      (B) Subclauses (iii) through (v) of subparagraph (2)(A) and
    subparagraph (2)(B) do not apply to food which is served in
    restaurants or other establishments in which food is served for
    immediate human consumption or which is sold for sale or use in
    such establishments.
      (C) A subparagraph (1)(A) claim made with respect to a food which
    claim is required by a standard of identity issued under section
    341 of this title shall not be subject to subparagraph (2)(A)(i) or
    (2)(B).
      (D) A subparagraph (1)(B) claim made with respect to a dietary
    supplement of vitamins, minerals, herbs, or other similar
    nutritional substances shall not be subject to subparagraph (3) but
    shall be subject to a procedure and standard, respecting the
    validity of such claim, established by regulation of the Secretary.
      (6) For purposes of paragraph (r)(1)(B), a statement for a
    dietary supplement may be made if - 
        (A) the statement claims a benefit related to a classical
      nutrient deficiency disease and discloses the prevalence of such
      disease in the United States, describes the role of a nutrient or
      dietary ingredient intended to affect the structure or function
      in humans, characterizes the documented mechanism by which a
      nutrient or dietary ingredient acts to maintain such structure or
      function, or describes general well-being from consumption of a
      nutrient or dietary ingredient,
        (B) the manufacturer of the dietary supplement has
      substantiation that such statement is truthful and not
      misleading, and
        (C) the statement contains, prominently displayed and in
      boldface type, the following: "This statement has not been
      evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is
      not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.".

    A statement under this subparagraph may not claim to diagnose,
    mitigate, treat, cure, or prevent a specific disease or class of
    diseases. If the manufacturer of a dietary supplement proposes to
    make a statement described in the first sentence of this
    subparagraph in the labeling of the dietary supplement, the
    manufacturer shall notify the Secretary no later than 30 days after
    the first marketing of the dietary supplement with such statement
    that such a statement is being made.
      (7) The Secretary may make proposed regulations issued under this
    paragraph effective upon publication pending consideration of
    public comment and publication of a final regulation if the
    Secretary determines that such action is necessary - 
        (A) to enable the Secretary to review and act promptly on
      petitions the Secretary determines provide for information
      necessary to - 
          (i) enable consumers to develop and maintain healthy dietary
        practices;
          (ii) enable consumers to be informed promptly and effectively
        of important new knowledge regarding nutritional and health
        benefits of food; or
          (iii) ensure that scientifically sound nutritional and health
        information is provided to consumers as soon as possible; or

        (B) to enable the Secretary to act promptly to ban or modify a
      claim under this paragraph.

    Such proposed regulations shall be deemed final agency action for
    purposes of judicial review.
    (s) Dietary supplements
      If - 
        (1) it is a dietary supplement; and
        (2)(A) the label or labeling of the supplement fails to list - 
          (i) the name of each ingredient of the supplement that is
        described in section 321(ff) of this title; and
          (ii)(I) the quantity of each such ingredient; or
          (II) with respect to a proprietary blend of such ingredients,
        the total quantity of all ingredients in the blend;

        (C) the supplement contains an ingredient described in section
      321(ff)(1)(C) of this title, and the label or labeling of the
      supplement fails to identify any part of the plant from which the
      ingredient is derived;
        (D) the supplement - 
          (i) is covered by the specifications of an official
        compendium;

          (i) is not covered by the specifications of an official
        compendium; and
          (ii)(I) fails to have the identity and strength that the
        supplement is represented to have; or
          (II) fails to meet the quality (including tablet or capsule
        disintegration), purity, or compositional specifications, based
        on validated assay or other appropriate methods, that the
        supplement is represented to meet.

    A dietary supplement shall not be deemed misbranded solely because
    its label or labeling contains directions or conditions of use or
    warnings.
    (t) Catfish
      If it purports to be or is represented as catfish, unless it is
    fish classified within the family Ictaluridae.

       If - 
        (1) it fails to bear a label required by the Secretary under
      section 381(n)(1) of this title (relating to food refused
      admission into the United States);
        (2) the Secretary finds that the food presents a threat of
      serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or
      animals; and
        (3) upon or after notifying the owner or consignee involved
      that the label is required under section 381 of this title, the
      Secretary informs the owner or consignee that the food presents
      such a threat.
    (w) Major food allergen labeling requirements
      (1) If it is not a raw agricultural commodity and it is, or it
    contains an ingredient that bears or contains, a major food
    allergen, unless either - 
        (A) the word "Contains", followed by the name of the food
      source from which the major food allergen is derived, is printed
      immediately after or is adjacent to the list of ingredients (in a
      type size no smaller than the type size used in the list of
      ingredients) required under subsections (g) and (i) of this
      section; or
        (B) the common or usual name of the major food allergen in the
      list of ingredients required under subsections (g) and (i) of
      this section is followed in parentheses by the name of the food
      source from which the major food allergen is derived, except that
      the name of the food source is not required when - 
          (i) the common or usual name of the ingredient uses the name
        of the food source from which the major food allergen is
        derived; or
          (ii) the name of the food source from which the major food
        allergen is derived appears elsewhere in the ingredient list,
        unless the name of the food source that appears elsewhere in
        the ingredient list appears as part of the name of a food
        ingredient that is not a major food allergen under section
        321(qq)(2)(A) or (B) of this title.

      (2) As used in this subsection, the term "name of the food source
    from which the major food allergen is derived" means the name
    described in section 321(qq)(1) of this title; provided that in the
    case of a tree nut, fish, or Crustacean shellfish, the term "name
    of the food source from which the major food allergen is derived"
    means the name of the specific type of nut or species of fish or
    Crustacean shellfish.
      (3) The information required under this subsection may appear in
    labeling in lieu of appearing on the label only if the Secretary
    finds that such other labeling is sufficient to protect the public
    health. A finding by the Secretary under this paragraph (including
    any change in an earlier finding under this paragraph) is effective
    upon publication in the Federal Register as a notice.
      (4) Notwithstanding subsection (g), (i), or (k) of this section,
    or any other law, a flavoring, coloring, or incidental additive
    that is, or that bears or contains, a major food allergen shall be
    subject to the labeling requirements of this subsection.
      (5) The Secretary may by regulation modify the requirements of
    subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1), or eliminate either the
    requirement of subparagraph (A) or the requirements of subparagraph
    (B) of paragraph (1), if the Secretary determines that the
    modification or elimination of the requirement of subparagraph (A)
    or the requirements of subparagraph (B) is necessary to protect the
    public health.
      (6)(A) Any person may petition the Secretary to exempt a food
    ingredient described in section 321(qq)(2) of this title from the
    allergen labeling requirements of this subsection.
      (B) The Secretary shall approve or deny such petition within 180
    days of receipt of the petition or the petition shall be deemed
    denied, unless an extension of time is mutually agreed upon by the
    Secretary and the petitioner.
      (C) The burden shall be on the petitioner to provide scientific
    evidence (including the analytical method used to produce the
    evidence) that demonstrates that such food ingredient, as derived
    by the method specified in the petition, does not cause an allergic
    response that poses a risk to human health.
      (D) A determination regarding a petition under this paragraph
    shall constitute final agency action.
      (E) The Secretary shall promptly post to a public site all
    petitions received under this paragraph within 14 days of receipt
    and the Secretary shall promptly post the Secretary's response to
    each.
      (7)(A) A person need not file a petition under paragraph (6) to
    exempt a food ingredient described in section 321(qq)(2) of this
    title from the allergen labeling requirements of this subsection,
    if the person files with the Secretary a notification containing - 
        (i) scientific evidence (including the analytical method used)
      that demonstrates that the food ingredient (as derived by the
      method specified in the notification, where applicable) does not
      contain allergenic protein; or
        (ii) a determination by the Secretary that the ingredient does
      not cause an allergic response that poses a risk to human health
      under a premarket approval or notification program under section
      348 of this title.

      (B) The food ingredient may be introduced or delivered for
    introduction into interstate commerce as a food ingredient that is
    not a major food allergen 90 days after the date of receipt of the
    notification by the Secretary, unless the Secretary determines
    within the 90-day period that the notification does not meet the
    requirements of this paragraph, or there is insufficient scientific
    evidence to determine that the food ingredient does not contain
    allergenic protein or does not cause an allergenic response that
    poses a risk to human health.
      (C) The Secretary shall promptly post to a public site all
    notifications received under this subparagraph within 14 days of
    receipt and promptly post any objections thereto by the Secretary.
    (x) Nonmajor food allergen labeling requirements
      Notwithstanding subsection (g), (i), or (k) of this section, or
    any other law, a spice, flavoring, coloring, or incidental additive
    that is, or that bears or contains, a food allergen (other than a
    major food allergen), as determined by the Secretary by regulation,
    shall be disclosed in a manner specified by the Secretary by
    regulation.
    (y) Dietary supplements
      If it is a dietary supplement that is marketed in the United
    States, unless the label of such dietary supplement includes a
    domestic address or domestic phone number through which the
    responsible person (as described in section 379aa-1 of this title)
    may receive a report of a serious adverse event with such dietary
    supplement.

    provided that: "Congress finds that - 
        "(1) it is estimated that - 
          "(A) approximately 2 percent of adults and about 5 percent of
        infants and young children in the United States suffer from
        food allergies; and
          "(B) each year, roughly 30,000 individuals require emergency
        room treatment and 150 individuals die because of allergic
        reactions to food;
        "(2)(A) eight major foods or food groups - milk, eggs, fish,
      Crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat, and soybeans -
      account for 90 percent of food allergies;
        "(B) at present, there is no cure for food allergies; and
        "(C) a food allergic consumer must avoid the food to which the
      consumer is allergic;
        "(3)(A) in a review of the foods of randomly selected
      manufacturers of baked goods, ice cream, and candy in Minnesota
      and Wisconsin in 1999, the Food and Drug Administration found
      that 25 percent of sampled foods failed to list peanuts or eggs
      as ingredients on the food labels; and
        "(B) nationally, the number of recalls because of unlabeled
      allergens rose to 121 in 2000 from about 35 a decade earlier;
        "(4) a recent study shows that many parents of children with a
      food allergy were unable to correctly identify in each of several
      food labels the ingredients derived from major food allergens;
        "(5)(A) ingredients in foods must be listed by their 'common or
      usual name';
        "(B) in some cases, the common or usual name of an ingredient
      may be unfamiliar to consumers, and many consumers may not
      realize the ingredient is derived from, or contains, a major food
      allergen; and
        "(C) in other cases, the ingredients may be declared as a
      class, including spices, flavorings, and certain colorings, or
      are exempt from the ingredient labeling requirements, such as
      incidental additives; and
        "(6)(A) celiac disease is an immune-mediated disease that
      causes damage to the gastrointestinal tract, central nervous
      system, and other organs;
        "(B) the current recommended treatment is avoidance of glutens
      in foods that are associated with celiac disease; and
        "(C) a multicenter, multiyear study estimated that the
      prevalence of celiac disease in the United States is 0.5 to 1
      percent of the general population."

    Act, the proposed regulations issued in accordance with paragraph

    (a) Conditions on manufacturing, processing, etc., as health

      Whenever the Secretary finds after investigation that the
    distribution in interstate commerce of any class of food may, by
    reason of contamination with micro-organisms during the
    manufacture, processing, or packing thereof in any locality, be
    injurious to health, and that such injurious nature cannot be
    adequately determined after such articles have entered interstate
    commerce, he then, and in such case only, shall promulgate
    regulations providing for the issuance, to manufacturers,
    processors, or packers of such class of food in such locality, of
    permits to which shall be attached such conditions governing the
    manufacture, processing, or packing of such class of food, for such
    temporary period of time, as may be necessary to protect the public
    health; and after the effective date of such regulations, and
    during such temporary period, no person shall introduce or deliver
    for introduction into interstate commerce any such food
    manufactured, processed, or packed by any such manufacturer,
    processor, or packer unless such manufacturer, processor, or packer
    holds a permit issued by the Secretary as provided by such
    regulations.
    (b) Violation of permit; suspension and reinstatement
      The Secretary is authorized to suspend immediately upon notice
    any permit issued under authority of this section if it is found
    that any of the conditions of the permit have been violated. The
    holder of a permit so suspended shall be privileged at any time to
    apply for the reinstatement of such permit, and the Secretary
    shall, immediately after prompt hearing and an inspection of the
    establishment, reinstate such permit if it is found that adequate
    measures have been taken to comply with and maintain the conditions
    of the permit, as originally issued or as amended.
    (c) Inspection of permit-holding establishments
      Any officer or employee duly designated by the Secretary shall
    have access to any factory or establishment, the operator of which
    holds a permit from the Secretary, for the purpose of ascertaining
    whether or not the conditions of the permit are being complied
    with, and denial of access for such inspection shall be ground for
    suspension of the permit until such access is freely given by the
    operator.

-STATUTE-
      Any poisonous or deleterious substance added to any food, except
    where such substance is required in the production thereof or
    cannot be avoided by good manufacturing practice shall be deemed to
    be unsafe for purposes of the application of clause (2)(A) of
    section 342(a) of this title; but when such substance is so
    required or cannot be so avoided, the Secretary shall promulgate
    regulations limiting the quantity therein or thereon to such extent
    as he finds necessary for the protection of public health, and any
    quantity exceeding the limits so fixed shall also be deemed to be
    unsafe for purposes of the application of clause (2)(A) of section
    342(a) of this title. While such a regulation is in effect limiting
    the quantity of any such substance in the case of any food, such
    food shall not, by reason of bearing or containing any added amount
    of such substance, be considered to be adulterated within the
    meaning of clause (1) of section 342(a) of this title. In
    determining the quantity of such added substance to be tolerated in
    or on different articles of food the Secretary shall take into
    account the extent to which the use of such substance is required
    or cannot be avoided in the production of each such article, and
    the other ways in which the consumer may be affected by the same or
    other poisonous or deleterious substances.

      residues

-STATUTE-
    (a) Requirement for tolerance or exemption
      (1) General rule
        Except as provided in paragraph (2) or (3), any pesticide
      chemical residue in or on a food shall be deemed unsafe for the
      purpose of section 342(a)(2)(B) of this title unless - 
          (A) a tolerance for such pesticide chemical residue in or on
        such food is in effect under this section and the quantity of
        the residue is within the limits of the tolerance; or
          (B) an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance is in
        effect under this section for the pesticide chemical residue.

      For the purposes of this section, the term "food", when used as a
      noun without modification, shall mean a raw agricultural
      commodity or processed food.
      (2) Processed food
        Notwithstanding paragraph (1) - 
          (A) if a tolerance is in effect under this section for a
        pesticide chemical residue in or on a raw agricultural
        commodity, a pesticide chemical residue that is present in or
        on a processed food because the food is made from that raw
        agricultural commodity shall not be considered unsafe within
        the meaning of section 342(a)(2)(B) of this title despite the
        lack of a tolerance for the pesticide chemical residue in or on
        the processed food if the pesticide chemical has been used in
        or on the raw agricultural commodity in conformity with a
        tolerance under this section, such residue in or on the raw
        agricultural commodity has been removed to the extent possible
        in good manufacturing practice, and the concentration of the
        pesticide chemical residue in the processed food is not greater
        than the tolerance prescribed for the pesticide chemical
        residue in the raw agricultural commodity; or
          (B) if an exemption for the requirement for a tolerance is in
        effect under this section for a pesticide chemical residue in
        or on a raw agricultural commodity, a pesticide chemical
        residue that is present in or on a processed food because the
        food is made from that raw agricultural commodity shall not be
        considered unsafe within the meaning of section 342(a)(2)(B) of
        this title.
      (3) Residues of degradation products
        If a pesticide chemical residue is present in or on a food
      because it is a metabolite or other degradation product of a
      precursor substance that itself is a pesticide chemical or
      pesticide chemical residue, such a residue shall not be
      considered to be unsafe within the meaning of section
      342(a)(2)(B) of this title despite the lack of a tolerance or
      exemption from the need for a tolerance for such residue in or on
      such food if - 
          (A) the Administrator has not determined that the degradation
        product is likely to pose any potential health risk from
        dietary exposure that is of a different type than, or of a
        greater significance than, any risk posed by dietary exposure
        to the precursor substance;
          (B) either - 
            (i) a tolerance is in effect under this section for
          residues of the precursor substance in or on the food, and
          the combined level of residues of the degradation product and
          the precursor substance in or on the food is at or below the
          stoichiometrically equivalent level that would be permitted
          by the tolerance if the residue consisted only of the
          precursor substance rather than the degradation product; or
            (ii) an exemption from the need for a tolerance is in
          effect under this section for residues of the precursor
          substance in or on the food; and

          (C) the tolerance or exemption for residues of the precursor
        substance does not state that it applies only to particular
        named substances and does not state that it does not apply to
        residues of the degradation product.
      (4) Effect of tolerance or exemption
        While a tolerance or exemption from the requirement for a
      tolerance is in effect under this section for a pesticide
      chemical residue with respect to any food, the food shall not by
      reason of bearing or containing any amount of such a residue be
      considered to be adulterated within the meaning of section
      342(a)(1) of this title.
    (b) Authority and standard for tolerance
      (1) Authority
        The Administrator may issue regulations establishing,
      modifying, or revoking a tolerance for a pesticide chemical
      residue in or on a food - 
          (A) in response to a petition filed under subsection (d) of
        this section; or
          (B) on the Administrator's own initiative under subsection
        (e) of this section.

      As used in this section, the term "modify" shall not mean
      expanding the tolerance to cover additional foods.
      (2) Standard
        (A) General rule
          (i) Standard
            The Administrator may establish or leave in effect a
          tolerance for a pesticide chemical residue in or on a food
          only if the Administrator determines that the tolerance is
          safe. The Administrator shall modify or revoke a tolerance if
          the Administrator determines it is not safe.
          (ii) Determination of safety
            As used in this section, the term "safe", with respect to a
          tolerance for a pesticide chemical residue, means that the
          Administrator has determined that there is a reasonable
          certainty that no harm will result from aggregate exposure to
          the pesticide chemical residue, including all anticipated
          dietary exposures and all other exposures for which there is
          reliable information.
          (iii) Rule of construction
            With respect to a tolerance, a pesticide chemical residue
          meeting the standard under clause (i) is not an eligible
          pesticide chemical residue for purposes of subparagraph (B).
        (B) Tolerances for eligible pesticide chemical residues
          (i) Definition
            As used in this subparagraph, the term "eligible pesticide
          chemical residue" means a pesticide chemical residue as to
          which - 
              (I) the Administrator is not able to identify a level of
            exposure to the residue at which the residue will not cause
            or contribute to a known or anticipated harm to human
            health (referred to in this section as a "nonthreshold
            effect");
              (II) the lifetime risk of experiencing the nonthreshold
            effect is appropriately assessed by quantitative risk
            assessment; and
              (III) with regard to any known or anticipated harm to
            human health for which the Administrator is able to
            identify a level at which the residue will not cause such
            harm (referred to in this section as a "threshold effect"),
            the Administrator determines that the level of aggregate
            exposure is safe.
          (ii) Determination of tolerance
            Notwithstanding subparagraph (A)(i), a tolerance for an
          eligible pesticide chemical residue may be left in effect or
          modified under this subparagraph if - 
              (I) at least one of the conditions described in clause
            (iii) is met; and
              (II) both of the conditions described in clause (iv) are
            met.
          (iii) Conditions regarding use
            For purposes of clause (ii), the conditions described in
          this clause with respect to a tolerance for an eligible
          pesticide chemical residue are the following:
              (I) Use of the pesticide chemical that produces the
            residue protects consumers from adverse effects on health
            that would pose a greater risk than the dietary risk from
            the residue.
              (II) Use of the pesticide chemical that produces the
            residue is necessary to avoid a significant disruption in
            domestic production of an adequate, wholesome, and
            economical food supply.
          (iv) Conditions regarding risk
            For purposes of clause (ii), the conditions described in
          this clause with respect to a tolerance for an eligible
          pesticide chemical residue are the following:
              (I) The yearly risk associated with the nonthreshold
            effect from aggregate exposure to the residue does not
            exceed 10 times the yearly risk that would be allowed under
            subparagraph (A) for such effect.
              (II) The tolerance is limited so as to ensure that the
            risk over a lifetime associated with the nonthreshold
            effect from aggregate exposure to the residue is not
            greater than twice the lifetime risk that would be allowed
            under subparagraph (A) for such effect.
          (v) Review
            Five years after the date on which the Administrator makes
          a determination to leave in effect or modify a tolerance
          under this subparagraph, and thereafter as the Administrator
          deems appropriate, the Administrator shall determine, after
          notice and opportunity for comment, whether it has been
          demonstrated to the Administrator that a condition described
          in clause (iii)(I) or clause (iii)(II) continues to exist
          with respect to the tolerance and that the yearly and
          lifetime risks from aggregate exposure to such residue
          continue to comply with the limits specified in clause (iv).
          If the Administrator determines by such date that such
          demonstration has not been made, the Administrator shall, not
          later than 180 days after the date of such determination,
          issue a regulation under subsection (e)(1) of this section to
          modify or revoke the tolerance.
          (vi) Infants and children
            Any tolerance under this subparagraph shall meet the
          requirements of subparagraph (C).
        (C) Exposure of infants and children
          In establishing, modifying, leaving in effect, or revoking a
        tolerance or exemption for a pesticide chemical residue, the
        Administrator - 
            (i) shall assess the risk of the pesticide chemical residue
          based on - 
              (I) available information about consumption patterns
            among infants and children that are likely to result in
            disproportionately high consumption of foods containing or
            bearing such residue among infants and children in
            comparison to the general population;
              (II) available information concerning the special
            susceptibility of infants and children to the pesticide
            chemical residues, including neurological differences
            between infants and children and adults, and effects of in
            utero exposure to pesticide chemicals; and
              (III) available information concerning the cumulative
            effects on infants and children of such residues and other
            substances that have a common mechanism of toxicity; and

            (ii) shall - 
              (I) ensure that there is a reasonable certainty that no
            harm will result to infants and children from aggregate
            exposure to the pesticide chemical residue; and
              (II) publish a specific determination regarding the
            safety of the pesticide chemical residue for infants and
            children.

        The Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of
        Agriculture, in consultation with the Administrator, shall
        conduct surveys to document dietary exposure to pesticides
        among infants and children. In the case of threshold effects,
        for purposes of clause (ii)(I) an additional tenfold margin of
        safety for the pesticide chemical residue and other sources of
        exposure shall be applied for infants and children to take into
        account potential pre- and post-natal toxicity and completeness
        of the data with respect to exposure and toxicity to infants
        and children. Notwithstanding such requirement for an
        additional margin of safety, the Administrator may use a
        different margin of safety for the pesticide chemical residue
        only if, on the basis of reliable data, such margin will be
        safe for infants and children.
        (D) Factors
          In establishing, modifying, leaving in effect, or revoking a
        tolerance or exemption for a pesticide chemical residue, the
        Administrator shall consider, among other relevant factors - 
            (i) the validity, completeness, and reliability of the
          available data from studies of the pesticide chemical and
          pesticide chemical residue;
            (ii) the nature of any toxic effect shown to be caused by
          the pesticide chemical or pesticide chemical residue in such
          studies;
            (iii) available information concerning the relationship of
          the results of such studies to human risk;
            (iv) available information concerning the dietary
          consumption patterns of consumers (and major identifiable
          subgroups of consumers);
            (v) available information concerning the cumulative effects
          of such residues and other substances that have a common
          mechanism of toxicity;
            (vi) available information concerning the aggregate
          exposure levels of consumers (and major identifiable
          subgroups of consumers) to the pesticide chemical residue and
          to other related substances, including dietary exposure under
          the tolerance and all other tolerances in effect for the
          pesticide chemical residue, and exposure from other non-
          occupational sources;
            (vii) available information concerning the variability of
          the sensitivities of major identifiable subgroups of
          consumers;
            (viii) such information as the Administrator may require on
          whether the pesticide chemical may have an effect in humans
          that is similar to an effect produced by a naturally
          occurring estrogen or other endocrine effects; and
            (ix) safety factors which in the opinion of experts
          qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate
          the safety of food additives are generally recognized as
          appropriate for the use of animal experimentation data.
        (E) Data and information regarding anticipated and actual
          residue levels
          (i) Authority
            In establishing, modifying, leaving in effect, or revoking
          a tolerance for a pesticide chemical residue, the
          Administrator may consider available data and information on
          the anticipated residue levels of the pesticide chemical in
          or on food and the actual residue levels of the pesticide
          chemical that have been measured in food, including residue
          data collected by the Food and Drug Administration.
          (ii) Requirement
            If the Administrator relies on anticipated or actual
          residue levels in establishing, modifying, or leaving in
          effect a tolerance, the Administrator shall pursuant to
          subsection (f)(1) of this section require that data be
          provided five years after the date on which the tolerance is
          established, modified, or left in effect, and thereafter as
          the Administrator deems appropriate, demonstrating that such
          residue levels are not above the levels so relied on. If such
          data are not so provided, or if the data do not demonstrate
          that the residue levels are not above the levels so relied
          on, the Administrator shall, not later than 180 days after
          the date on which the data were required to be provided,
          issue a regulation under subsection (e)(1) of this section,
          or an order under subsection (f)(2) of this section, as
          appropriate, to modify or revoke the tolerance.
        (F) Percent of food actually treated
          In establishing, modifying, leaving in effect, or revoking a
        tolerance for a pesticide chemical residue, the Administrator
        may, when assessing chronic dietary risk, consider available
        data and information on the percent of food actually treated
        with the pesticide chemical (including aggregate pesticide use
        data collected by the Department of Agriculture) only if the
        Administrator - 
            (i) finds that the data are reliable and provide a valid
          basis to show what percentage of the food derived from such
          crop is likely to contain such pesticide chemical residue;
            (ii) finds that the exposure estimate does not understate
          exposure for any significant subpopulation group;
            (iii) finds that, if data are available on pesticide use
          and consumption of food in a particular area, the population
          in such area is not dietarily exposed to residues above those
          estimated by the Administrator; and
            (iv) provides for the periodic reevaluation of the estimate
          of anticipated dietary exposure.
      (3) Detection methods
        (A) General rule
          A tolerance for a pesticide chemical residue in or on a food
        shall not be established or modified by the Administrator
        unless the Administrator determines, after consultation with
        the Secretary, that there is a practical method for detecting
        and measuring the levels of the pesticide chemical residue in
        or on the food.
        (B) Detection limit
          A tolerance for a pesticide chemical residue in or on a food
        shall not be established at or modified to a level lower than
        the limit of detection of the method for detecting and
        measuring the pesticide chemical residue specified by the
        Administrator under subparagraph (A).
      (4) International standards
        In establishing a tolerance for a pesticide chemical residue in
      or on a food, the Administrator shall determine whether a maximum
      residue level for the pesticide chemical has been established by
      the Codex Alimentarius Commission. If a Codex maximum residue
      level has been established for the pesticide chemical and the
      Administrator does not propose to adopt the Codex level, the
      Administrator shall publish for public comment a notice
      explaining the reasons for departing from the Codex level.
    (c) Authority and standard for exemptions
      (1) Authority
        The Administrator may issue a regulation establishing,
      modifying, or revoking an exemption from the requirement for a
      tolerance for a pesticide chemical residue in or on food - 
          (A) in response to a petition filed under subsection (d) of
        this section; or
          (B) on the Administrator's initiative under subsection (e) of
        this section.
      (2) Standard
        (A) General rule
          (i) Standard
            The Administrator may establish or leave in effect an
          exemption from the requirement for a tolerance for a
          pesticide chemical residue in or on food only if the
          Administrator determines that the exemption is safe. The
          Administrator shall modify or revoke an exemption if the
          Administrator determines it is not safe.
          (ii) Determination of safety
            The term "safe", with respect to an exemption for a
          pesticide chemical residue, means that the Administrator has
          determined that there is a reasonable certainty that no harm
          will result from aggregate exposure to the pesticide chemical
          residue, including all anticipated dietary exposures and all
          other exposures for which there is reliable information.
        (B) Factors
          In making a determination under this paragraph, the
        Administrator shall take into account, among other relevant
        considerations, the considerations set forth in subparagraphs
        (C) and (D) of subsection (b)(2) of this section.
      (3) Limitation
        An exemption from the requirement for a tolerance for a
      pesticide chemical residue in or on food shall not be established
      or modified by the Administrator unless the Administrator
      determines, after consultation with the Secretary - 
          (A) that there is a practical method for detecting and
        measuring the levels of such pesticide chemical residue in or
        on food; or
          (B) that there is no need for such a method, and states the
        reasons for such determination in issuing the regulation
        establishing or modifying the exemption.
    (d) Petition for tolerance or exemption
      (1) Petitions and petitioners
        Any person may file with the Administrator a petition proposing
      the issuance of a regulation - 
          (A) establishing, modifying, or revoking a tolerance for a
        pesticide chemical residue in or on a food; or
          (B) establishing, modifying, or revoking an exemption from
        the requirement of a tolerance for such a residue.
      (2) Petition contents
        (A) Establishment

          processing method(s) used to produce that food;
            (ix) such information as the Administrator may require to
          make the determination under subsection (b)(2)(C) of this
          section;
            (x) such information as the Administrator may require on
          whether the pesticide chemical may have an effect in humans
          that is similar to an effect produced by a naturally
          occurring estrogen or other endocrine effects;
            (xi) information regarding exposure to the pesticide
          chemical residue due to any tolerance or exemption already
          granted for such residue;
            (xii) practical methods for removing any amount of the
          residue that would exceed any proposed tolerance; and
            (xiii) such other data and information as the Administrator
          requires by regulation to support the petition.

        If information or data required by this subparagraph is
        available to the Administrator, the person submitting the
        petition may cite the availability of the information or data
        in lieu of submitting it. The Administrator may require a
        petition to be accompanied by samples of the pesticide chemical
        with respect to which the petition is filed.
        (B) Modification or revocation
          The Administrator may by regulation establish the
        requirements for information and data to support a petition to
        modify or revoke a tolerance or to modify or revoke an
        exemption from the requirement for a tolerance.
      (3) Notice
        A notice of the filing of a petition that the Administrator
      determines has met the requirements of paragraph (2) shall be
      published by the Administrator within 30 days after such
      determination. The notice shall announce the availability of a
      description of the analytical methods available to the
      Administrator for the detection and measurement of the pesticide
      chemical residue with respect to which the petition is filed or
      shall set forth the petitioner's statement of why such a method
      is not needed. The notice shall include the summary required by
      paragraph (2)(A)(i)(I).
      (4) Actions by the Administrator
        (A) In general
          The Administrator shall, after giving due consideration to a
        petition filed under paragraph (1) and any other information
        available to the Administrator - 
            (i) issue a final regulation (which may vary from that
          sought by the petition) establishing, modifying, or revoking
          a tolerance for the pesticide chemical residue or an
          exemption of the pesticide chemical residue from the
          requirement of a tolerance (which final regulation shall be
          issued without further notice and without further period for
          public comment);
            (ii) issue a proposed regulation under subsection (e) of
          this section, and thereafter issue a final regulation under
          such subsection; or
            (iii) issue an order denying the petition.
        (B) Priorities
          The Administrator shall give priority to petitions for the
        establishment or modification of a tolerance or exemption for a
        pesticide chemical residue that appears to pose a significantly
        lower risk to human health from dietary exposure than pesticide
        chemical residues that have tolerances in effect for the same
        or similar uses.
        (C) Expedited review of certain petitions
          (i) Date certain for review
            If a person files a complete petition with the
          Administrator proposing the issuance of a regulation
          establishing a tolerance or exemption for a pesticide
          chemical residue that presents a lower risk to human health
          than a pesticide chemical residue for which a tolerance has
          been left in effect or modified under subsection (b)(2)(B) of
          this section, the Administrator shall complete action on such
          petition under this paragraph within 1 year.
          (ii) Required determinations
            If the Administrator issues a final regulation establishing
          a tolerance or exemption for a safer pesticide chemical
          residue under clause (i), the Administrator shall, not later
          than 180 days after the date on which the regulation is
          issued, determine whether a condition described in subclause
          (I) or (II) of subsection (b)(2)(B)(iii) of this section
          continues to exist with respect to a tolerance that has been
          left in effect or modified under subsection (b)(2)(B) of this
          section. If such condition does not continue to exist, the
          Administrator shall, not later than 180 days after the date
          on which the determination under the preceding sentence is
          made, issue a regulation under subsection (e)(1) of this
          section to modify or revoke the tolerance.
    (e) Action on Administrator's own initiative
      (1) General rule
        The Administrator may issue a regulation - 
          (A) establishing, modifying, suspending under subsection
        (l)(3) of this section, or revoking a tolerance for a pesticide
        chemical or a pesticide chemical residue;
          (B) establishing, modifying, suspending under subsection
        (l)(3) of this section, or revoking an exemption of a pesticide
        chemical residue from the requirement of a tolerance; or
          (C) establishing general procedures and requirements to
        implement this section.
      (2) Notice
        Before issuing a final regulation under paragraph (1), the
      Administrator shall issue a notice of proposed rulemaking and
      provide a period of not less than 60 days for public comment on
      the proposed regulation, except that a shorter period for comment
      may be provided if the Administrator for good cause finds that it
      would be in the public interest to do so and states the reasons
      for the finding in the notice of proposed rulemaking.
    (f) Special data requirements
      (1) Requiring submission of additional data
        If the Administrator determines that additional data or
      information are reasonably required to support the continuation
      of a tolerance or exemption that is in effect under this section
      for a pesticide chemical residue on a food, the Administrator
      shall - 
          (A) issue a notice requiring the person holding the pesticide
        registrations associated with such tolerance or exemption to
        submit the data or information under section 3(c)(2)(B) of the
        Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act [7 U.S.C.
        136a(c)(2)(B)];
          (B) issue a rule requiring that testing be conducted on a
        substance or mixture under section 4 of the Toxic Substances
        Control Act [15 U.S.C. 2603]; or
          (C) publish in the Federal Register, after first providing
        notice and an opportunity for comment of not less than 60 days'
        duration, an order - 
            (i) requiring the submission to the Administrator by one or
          more interested persons of a notice identifying the person or
          persons who will submit the required data and information;
            (ii) describing the type of data and information required
          to be submitted to the Administrator and stating why the data
          and information could not be obtained under the authority of
          section 3(c)(2)(B) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and
          Rodenticide Act [7 U.S.C. 136a(c)(2)(B)] or section 4 of the
          Toxic Substances Control Act [15 U.S.C. 2603];
            (iii) describing the reports of the Administrator required
          to be prepared during and after the collection of the data
          and information;
            (iv) requiring the submission to the Administrator of the
          data, information, and reports referred to in clauses (ii)
          and (iii); and
            (v) establishing dates by which the submissions described
          in clauses (i) and (iv) must be made.

        The Administrator may under subparagraph (C) revise any such
        order to correct an error. The Administrator may under this
        paragraph require data or information pertaining to whether the
        pesticide chemical may have an effect in humans that is similar
        to an effect produced by a naturally occurring estrogen or
        other endocrine effects.
      (2) Noncompliance
        If a submission required by a notice issued in accordance with
      paragraph (1)(A), a rule issued under paragraph (1)(B), or an
      order issued under paragraph (1)(C) is not made by the time
      specified in such notice, rule, or order, the Administrator may
      by order published in the Federal Register modify or revoke the
      tolerance or exemption in question. In any review of such an
      order under subsection (g)(2) of this section, the only material
      issue shall be whether a submission required under paragraph (1)
      was not made by the time specified.
    (g) Effective date, objections, hearings, and administrative review
      (1) Effective date
        A regulation or order issued under subsection (d)(4), (e)(1),
      or (f)(2) of this section shall take effect upon publication
      unless the regulation or order specifies otherwise. The
      Administrator may stay the effectiveness of the regulation or
      order if, after issuance of such regulation or order, objections
      are filed with respect to such regulation or order pursuant to
      paragraph (2).
      (2) Further proceedings
        (A) Objections
          Within 60 days after a regulation or order is issued under
        subsection (d)(4), (e)(1)(A), (e)(1)(B), (f)(2), (n)(3), or
        (n)(5)(C) of this section, any person may file objections
        thereto with the Administrator, specifying with particularity
        the provisions of the regulation or order deemed objectionable
        and stating reasonable grounds therefor. If the regulation or
        order was issued in response to a petition under subsection
        (d)(1) of this section, a copy of each objection filed by a
        person other than the petitioner shall be served by the
        Administrator on the petitioner.
        (B) Hearing
          An objection may include a request for a public evidentiary
        hearing upon the objection. The Administrator shall, upon the
        initiative of the Administrator or upon the request of an
        interested person and after due notice, hold a public
        evidentiary hearing if and to the extent the Administrator
        determines that such a public hearing is necessary to receive
        factual evidence relevant to material issues of fact raised by
        the objections. The presiding officer in such a hearing may
        authorize a party to obtain discovery from other persons and
        may upon a showing of good cause made by a party issue a
        subpoena to compel testimony or production of documents from
        any person. The presiding officer shall be governed by the
        Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in making any order for the
        protection of the witness or the content of documents produced
        and shall order the payment of reasonable fees and expenses as
        a condition to requiring testimony of the witness. On contest,
        such a subpoena may be enforced by a Federal district court.
        (C) Final decision
          As soon as practicable after receiving the arguments of the
        parties, the Administrator shall issue an order stating the
        action taken upon each such objection and setting forth any
        revision to the regulation or prior order that the
        Administrator has found to be warranted. If a hearing was held
        under subparagraph (B), such order and any revision to the
        regulation or prior order shall, with respect to questions of
        fact at issue in the hearing, be based only on substantial
        evidence of record at such hearing, and shall set forth in
        detail the findings of facts and the conclusions of law or
        policy upon which the order or regulation is based.
    (h) Judicial review
      (1) Petition
        In a case of actual controversy as to the validity of any
      regulation issued under subsection (e)(1)(C) of this section, or
      any order issued under subsection (f)(1)(C) or (g)(2)(C) of this
      section, or any regulation that is the subject of such an order,
      any person who will be adversely affected by such order or
      regulation may obtain judicial review by filing in the United
      States Court of Appeals for the circuit wherein that person
      resides or has its principal place of business, or in the United
      States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit,
      within 60 days after publication of such order or regulation, a
      petition praying that the order or regulation be set aside in
      whole or in part.
      (2) Record and jurisdiction
        A copy of the petition under paragraph (1) shall be forthwith
      transmitted by the clerk of the court to the Administrator, or
      any officer designated by the Administrator for that purpose, and
      thereupon the Administrator shall file in the court the record of
      the proceedings on which the Administrator based the order or
      regulation, as provided in section 2112 of title 28. Upon the
      filing of such a petition, the court shall have exclusive
      jurisdiction to affirm or set aside the order or regulation
      complained of in whole or in part. As to orders issued following
      a public evidentiary hearing, the findings of the Administrator
      with respect to questions of fact shall be sustained only if
      supported by substantial evidence when considered on the record
      as a whole.
      (3) Additional evidence
        If a party applies to the court for leave to adduce additional
      evidence and shows to the satisfaction of the court that the
      additional evidence is material and that there were reasonable
      grounds for the failure to adduce the evidence in the proceeding
      before the Administrator, the court may order that the additional
      evidence (and evidence in rebuttal thereof) shall be taken before
      the Administrator in the manner and upon the terms and conditions
      the court deems proper. The Administrator may modify prior
      findings as to the facts by reason of the additional evidence so
      taken and may modify the order or regulation accordingly. The
      Administrator shall file with the court any such modified
      finding, order, or regulation.
      (4) Final judgment; Supreme Court review
        The judgment of the court affirming or setting aside, in whole
      or in part, any regulation or any order and any regulation which
      is the subject of such an order shall be final, subject to review
      by the Supreme Court of the United States as provided in section
      1254 of title 28. The commencement of proceedings under this
      subsection shall not, unless specifically ordered by the court to
      the contrary, operate as a stay of a regulation or order.
      (5) Application
        Any issue as to which review is or was obtainable under this
      subsection shall not be the subject of judicial review under any
      other provision of law.
    (i) Confidentiality and use of data
      (1) General rule
        Data and information that are or have been submitted to the
      Administrator under this section or section 348 of this title in
      support of a tolerance or an exemption from a tolerance shall be
      entitled to confidential treatment for reasons of business
      confidentiality and to exclusive use and data compensation to the
      same extent provided by sections 3 and 10 of the Federal
      Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act [7 U.S.C. 136a,
      136h].
      (2) Exceptions
        (A) In general
          Data and information that are entitled to confidential
        treatment under paragraph (1) may be disclosed, under such
        security requirements as the Administrator may provide by
        regulation, to - 
            (i) employees of the United States authorized by the
          Administrator to examine such data and information in the
          carrying out of their official duties under this chapter or
          other Federal statutes intended to protect the public health;
          or
            (ii) contractors with the United States authorized by the
          Administrator to examine such data and information in the
          carrying out of contracts under this chapter or such
          statutes.
        (B) Congress
          This subsection does not authorize the withholding of data or
        information from either House of Congress or from, to the
        extent of matter within its jurisdiction, any committee or
        subcommittee of such committee or any joint committee of
        Congress or any subcommittee of such joint committee.
      (3) Summaries
        Notwithstanding any provision of this subsection or other law,
      the Administrator may publish the informative summary required by
      subsection (d)(2)(A)(i) of this section and may, in issuing a
      proposed or final regulation or order under this section, publish
      an informative summary of the data relating to the regulation or
      order.
    (j) Status of previously issued regulations
      (1) Regulations under section 346
        Regulations affecting pesticide chemical residues in or on raw
      agricultural commodities promulgated, in accordance with section
      371(e) of this title, under the authority of section 346(a) (!1)
      of this title upon the basis of public hearings instituted before
      January 1, 1953, shall be deemed to be regulations issued under
      this section and shall be subject to modification or revocation
      under subsections (d) and (e) of this section, and shall be
      subject to review under subsection (q) of this section.

      (2) Regulations under section 348
        Regulations that established tolerances for substances that are
      pesticide chemical residues in or on processed food, or that
      otherwise stated the conditions under which such pesticide
      chemicals could be safely used, and that were issued under
      section 348 of this title on or before August 3, 1996, shall be
      deemed to be regulations issued under this section and shall be
      subject to modification or revocation under subsection (d) or (e)
      of this section, and shall be subject to review under subsection
      (q) of this section.
      (3) Regulations under section 346a
        Regulations that established tolerances or exemptions under
      this section that were issued on or before August 3, 1996, shall
      remain in effect unless modified or revoked under subsection (d)
      or (e) of this section, and shall be subject to review under
      subsection (q) of this section.
      (4) Certain substances
        With respect to a substance that is not included in the
      definition of the term "pesticide chemical" under section
      321(q)(1) of this title but was so included on the day before
      October 30, 1998, the following applies as of October 30, 1998:
          (A) Notwithstanding paragraph (2), any regulation applying to
        the use of the substance that was in effect on the day before
        October 30, 1998, and was on such day deemed in such paragraph
        to have been issued under this section, shall be considered to
        have been issued under section 348 of this title.
          (B) Notwithstanding paragraph (3), any regulation applying to
        the use of the substance that was in effect on such day and was
        issued under this section (including any such regulation issued
        before August 3, 1996) is deemed to have been issued under
        section 348 of this title.
    (k) Transitional provision
      If, on the day before August 3, 1996, a substance that is a
    pesticide chemical was, with respect to a particular pesticidal use
    of the substance and any resulting pesticide chemical residue in or
    on a particular food - 
        (1) regarded by the Administrator or the Secretary as generally
      recognized as safe for use within the meaning of the provisions
      of subsection (a) of this section or section 321(s) of this title
      as then in effect; or
        (2) regarded by the Secretary as a substance described by
      section 321(s)(4) of this title;

    such a pesticide chemical residue shall be regarded as exempt from
    the requirement for a tolerance, as of August 3, 1996. The
    Administrator shall by regulation indicate which substances are
    described by this subsection. Any exemption under this subsection
    may be modified or revoked as if it had been issued under
    subsection (c) of this section.
    (l) Harmonization with action under other laws
      (1) Coordination with FIFRA
        To the extent practicable and consistent with the review
      deadlines in subsection (q) of this section, in issuing a final
      rule under this subsection that suspends or revokes a tolerance
      or exemption for a pesticide chemical residue in or on food, the
      Administrator shall coordinate such action with any related
      necessary action under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and
      Rodenticide Act [7 U.S.C. 136 et seq.].
      (2) Revocation of tolerance or exemption following cancellation
        of associated registrations
        If the Administrator, acting under the Federal Insecticide,
      Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, cancels the registration of each
      pesticide that contains a particular pesticide chemical and that
      is labeled for use on a particular food, or requires that the
      registration of each such pesticide be modified to prohibit its
      use in connection with the production, storage, or transportation
      of such food, due in whole or in part to dietary risks to humans
      posed by residues of that pesticide chemical on that food, the
      Administrator shall revoke any tolerance or exemption that allows
      the presence of the pesticide chemical, or any pesticide chemical
      residue that results from its use, in or on that food. Subsection
      (e) of this section shall apply to actions taken under this
      paragraph. A revocation under this paragraph shall become
      effective not later than 180 days after - 
          (A) the date by which each such cancellation of a
        registration has become effective; or
          (B) the date on which the use of the canceled pesticide
        becomes unlawful under the terms of the cancellation, whichever
        is later.
      (3) Suspension of tolerance or exemption following suspension of
        associated registrations
        (A) Suspension
          If the Administrator, acting under the Federal Insecticide,
        Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, suspends the use of each
        registered pesticide that contains a particular pesticide
        chemical and that is labeled for use on a particular food, due
        in whole or in part to dietary risks to humans posed by
        residues of that pesticide chemical on that food, the
        Administrator shall suspend any tolerance or exemption that
        allows the presence of the pesticide chemical, or any pesticide
        chemical residue that results from its use, in or on that food.
        Subsection (e) of this section shall apply to actions taken
        under this paragraph. A suspension under this paragraph shall
        become effective not later than 60 days after the date by which
        each such suspension of use has become effective.
        (B) Effect of suspension
          The suspension of a tolerance or exemption under subparagraph
        (A) shall be effective as long as the use of each associated
        registration of a pesticide is suspended under the Federal
        Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act. While a suspension
        of a tolerance or exemption is effective the tolerance or
        exemption shall not be considered to be in effect. If the
        suspension of use of the pesticide under that Act is
        terminated, leaving the registration of the pesticide for such
        use in effect under that Act, the Administrator shall rescind
        any associated suspension of tolerance or exemption.
      (4) Tolerances for unavoidable residues
        In connection with action taken under paragraph (2) or (3), or
      with respect to pesticides whose registrations were suspended or
      canceled prior to August 3, 1996, under the Federal Insecticide,
      Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, if the Administrator determines
      that a residue of the canceled or suspended pesticide chemical
      will unavoidably persist in the environment and thereby be
      present in or on a food, the Administrator may establish a
      tolerance for the pesticide chemical residue. In establishing
      such a tolerance, the Administrator shall take into account both
      the factors set forth in subsection (b)(2) of this section and
      the unavoidability of the residue. Subsection (e) of this section
      shall apply to the establishment of such tolerance. The
      Administrator shall review any such tolerance periodically and
      modify it as necessary so that it allows no greater level of the
      pesticide chemical residue than is unavoidable.
      (5) Pesticide residues resulting from lawful application of
        pesticide
        Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, if a
      tolerance or exemption for a pesticide chemical residue in or on
      a food has been revoked, suspended, or modified under this
      section, an article of that food shall not be deemed unsafe
      solely because of the presence of such pesticide chemical residue
      in or on such food if it is shown to the satisfaction of the
      Secretary that - 
          (A) the residue is present as the result of an application or
        use of a pesticide at a time and in a manner that was lawful
        under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act;
        and
          (B) the residue does not exceed a level that was authorized
        at the time of that application or use to be present on the
        food under a tolerance, exemption, food additive regulation, or
        other sanction then in effect under this chapter;

      unless, in the case of any tolerance or exemption revoked,
      suspended, or modified under this subsection or subsection (d) or
      (e) of this section, the Administrator has issued a determination
      that consumption of the legally treated food during the period of
      its likely availability in commerce will pose an unreasonable
      dietary risk.
      (6) Tolerance for use of pesticides under an emergency exemption
        If the Administrator grants an exemption under section 18 of
      the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (7 U.S.C.
      136p) for a pesticide chemical, the Administrator shall establish
      a tolerance or exemption from the requirement for a tolerance for
      the pesticide chemical residue. Such a tolerance or exemption
      from a tolerance shall have an expiration date. The Administrator
      may establish such a tolerance or exemption without providing
      notice or a period for comment on the tolerance or exemption. The
      Administrator shall promulgate regulations within 365 days after
      August 3, 1996, governing the establishment of tolerances and
      exemptions under this paragraph. Such regulations shall be
      consistent with the safety standard under subsections (b)(2) and
      (c)(2) of this section and with section 18 of the Federal
      Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act.
    (m) Fees
      (1) Amount
        The Administrator shall by regulation require the payment of
      such fees as will in the aggregate, in the judgment of the
      Administrator, be sufficient over a reasonable term to provide,
      equip, and maintain an adequate service for the performance of
      the Administrator's functions under this section. Under the
      regulations, the performance of the Administrator's services or
      other functions under this section, including - 
          (A) the acceptance for filing of a petition submitted under
        subsection (d) of this section;
          (B) establishing, modifying, leaving in effect, or revoking a
        tolerance or establishing, modifying, leaving in effect, or
        revoking an exemption from the requirement for a tolerance
        under this section;
          (C) the acceptance for filing of objections under subsection
        (g) of this section; or
          (D) the certification and filing in court of a transcript of
        the proceedings and the record under subsection (h) of this
        section;

      may be conditioned upon the payment of such fees. The regulations
      may further provide for waiver or refund of fees in whole or in
      part when in the judgment of the Administrator such a waiver or
      refund is equitable and not contrary to the purposes of this
      subsection.
      (2) Deposit
        All fees collected under paragraph (1) shall be deposited in
      the Reregistration and Expedited Processing Fund created by
      section 4(k) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and
      Rodenticide Act [7 U.S.C. 136a-1(k)]. Such fees shall be
      available to the Administrator, without fiscal year limitation,
      for the performance of the Administrator's services or functions
      as specified in paragraph (1).
    (n) National uniformity of tolerances
      (1) "Qualifying pesticide chemical residue" defined
        For purposes of this subsection, the term "qualifying pesticide
      chemical residue" means a pesticide chemical residue resulting
      from the use, in production, processing, or storage of a food, of
      a pesticide chemical that is an active ingredient and that - 
          (A) was first approved for such use in a registration of a
        pesticide issued under section 3(c)(5) of the Federal
        Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act [7 U.S.C.
        136a(c)(5)] on or after April 25, 1985, on the basis of data
        determined by the Administrator to meet all applicable
        requirements for data prescribed by regulations in effect under
        that Act [7 U.S.C. 136 et seq.] on April 25, 1985; or
          (B) was approved for such use in a reregistration eligibility
        determination issued under section 4(g) of that Act [7 U.S.C.
        136a-1(g)] on or after August 3, 1996.
      (2) "Qualifying Federal determination" defined
        For purposes of this subsection, the term "qualifying Federal
      determination" means a tolerance or exemption from the
      requirement for a tolerance for a qualifying pesticide chemical
      residue that - 
          (A) is issued under this section after August 3, 1996, and
        determined by the Administrator to meet the standard under
        subsection (b)(2)(A) (in the case of a tolerance) or (c)(2) (in
        the case of an exemption) of this section; or
          (B)(i) pursuant to subsection (j) of this section is
        remaining in effect or is deemed to have been issued under this
        section, or is regarded under subsection (k) of this section as
        exempt from the requirement for a tolerance; and
          (ii) is determined by the Administrator to meet the standard
        under subsection (b)(2)(A) (in the case of a tolerance) or
        (c)(2) (in the case of an exemption) of this section.
      (3) Limitation
        The Administrator may make the determination described in
      paragraph (2)(B)(ii) only by issuing a rule in accordance with
      the procedure set forth in subsection (d) or (e) of this section
      and only if the Administrator issues a proposed rule and allows a
      period of not less than 30 days for comment on the proposed rule.
      Any such rule shall be reviewable in accordance with subsections
      (g) and (h) of this section.
      (4) State authority
        Except as provided in paragraphs (5), (6), and (8) no State or
      political subdivision may establish or enforce any regulatory
      limit on a qualifying pesticide chemical residue in or on any
      food if a qualifying Federal determination applies to the
      presence of such pesticide chemical residue in or on such food,
      unless such State regulatory limit is identical to such
      qualifying Federal determination. A State or political
      subdivision shall be deemed to establish or enforce a regulatory
      limit on a pesticide chemical residue in or on a food if it
      purports to prohibit or penalize the production, processing,
      shipping, or other handling of a food because it contains a
      pesticide residue (in excess of a prescribed limit).
      (5) Petition procedure
        (A) In general
          Any State may petition the Administrator for authorization to
        establish in such State a regulatory limit on a qualifying
        pesticide chemical residue in or on any food that is not
        identical to the qualifying Federal determination applicable to
        such qualifying pesticide chemical residue.
        (B) Petition requirements
          Any petition under subparagraph (A) shall - 
            (i) satisfy any requirements prescribed, by rule, by the
          Administrator; and
            (ii) be supported by scientific data about the pesticide
          chemical residue that is the subject of the petition or about
          chemically related pesticide chemical residues, data on the
          consumption within such State of food bearing the pesticide
          chemical residue, and data on exposure of humans within such
          State to the pesticide chemical residue.
        (C) Authorization
          The Administrator may, by order, grant the authorization
        described in subparagraph (A) if the Administrator determines
        that the proposed State regulatory limit - 
            (i) is justified by compelling local conditions; and
            (ii) would not cause any food to be a violation of Federal
          law.
        (D) Treatment
          In lieu of any action authorized under subparagraph (C), the
        Administrator may treat a petition under this paragraph as a
        petition under subsection (d) of this section to modify or
        revoke a tolerance or an exemption. If the Administrator
        determines to treat a petition under this paragraph as a
        petition under subsection (d) of this section, the
        Administrator shall thereafter act on the petition pursuant to
        subsection (d) of this section.
        (E) Review
          Any order of the Administrator granting or denying the
        authorization described in subparagraph (A) shall be subject to
        review in the manner described in subsections (g) and (h) of
        this section.
      (6) Urgent petition procedure
        Any State petition to the Administrator pursuant to paragraph
      (5) that demonstrates that consumption of a food containing such
      pesticide residue level during the period of the food's likely
      availability in the State will pose a significant public health
      threat from acute exposure shall be considered an urgent
      petition. If an order by the Administrator to grant or deny the
      requested authorization in an urgent petition is not made within
      30 days of receipt of the petition, the petitioning State may
      establish and enforce a temporary regulatory limit on a
      qualifying pesticide chemical residue in or on the food. The
      temporary regulatory limit shall be validated or terminated by
      the Administrator's final order on the petition.
      (7) Residues from lawful application
        No State or political subdivision may enforce any regulatory
      limit on the level of a pesticide chemical residue that may
      appear in or on any food if, at the time of the application of
      the pesticide that resulted in such residue, the sale of such
      food with such residue level was lawful under this section and
      under the law of such State, unless the State demonstrates that
      consumption of the food containing such pesticide residue level
      during the period of the food's likely availability in the State
      will pose an unreasonable dietary risk to the health of persons
      within such State.
      (8) Savings
        Nothing in this chapter preempts the authority of any State or
      political subdivision to require that a food containing a
      pesticide chemical residue bear or be the subject of a warning or
      other statement relating to the presence of the pesticide
      chemical residue in or on such food.
    (o) Consumer right to know
      Not later than 2 years after August 3, 1996, and annually
    thereafter, the Administrator shall, in consultation with the
    Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Health and Human
    Services, publish in a format understandable to a lay person, and
    distribute to large retail grocers for public display (in a manner
    determined by the grocer), the following information, at a minimum:
        (1) A discussion of the risks and benefits of pesticide
      chemical residues in or on food purchased by consumers.
        (2) A listing of actions taken under subparagraph (B) of
      subsection (b)(2) of this section that may result in pesticide
      chemical residues in or on food that present a yearly or lifetime
      risk above the risk allowed under subparagraph (A) of such
      subsection, and the food on which the pesticide chemicals
      producing the residues are used.
        (3) Recommendations to consumers for reducing dietary exposure
      to pesticide chemical residues in a manner consistent with
      maintaining a healthy diet, including a list of food that may
      reasonably substitute for food listed under paragraph (2).

      Nothing in this subsection shall prevent retail grocers from
    providing additional information.
    (p) Estrogenic substances screening program
      (1) Development
        Not later than 2 years after August 3, 1996, the Administrator
      shall in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human
      Services develop a screening program, using appropriate validated
      test systems and other scientifically relevant information, to
      determine whether certain substances may have an effect in humans
      that is similar to an effect produced by a naturally occurring
      estrogen, or such other endocrine effect as the Administrator may
      designate.
      (2) Implementation
        Not later than 3 years after August 3, 1996, after obtaining
      public comment and review of the screening program described in
      paragraph (1) by the scientific advisory panel established under
      section 25(d) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and
      Rodenticide Act [7 U.S.C. 136w(d)] or the science advisory board
      established by section 4365 (!2) of title 42, the Administrator
      shall implement the program.

      (3) Substances
        In carrying out the screening program described in paragraph
      (1), the Administrator - 
          (A) shall provide for the testing of all pesticide chemicals;
        and
          (B) may provide for the testing of any other substance that
        may have an effect that is cumulative to an effect of a
        pesticide chemical if the Administrator determines that a
        substantial population may be exposed to such substance.
      (4) Exemption
        Notwithstanding paragraph (3), the Administrator may, by order,
      exempt from the requirements of this section a biologic substance
      or other substance if the Administrator determines that the
      substance is anticipated not to produce any effect in humans
      similar to an effect produced by a naturally occurring estrogen.
      (5) Collection of information
        (A) In general
          The Administrator shall issue an order to a registrant of a
        substance for which testing is required under this subsection,
        or to a person who manufactures or imports a substance for
        which testing is required under this subsection, to conduct
        testing in accordance with the screening program described in
        paragraph (1), and submit information obtained from the testing
        to the Administrator, within a reasonable time period that the
        Administrator determines is sufficient for the generation of
        the information.
        (B) Procedures
          To the extent practicable the Administrator shall minimize
        duplicative testing of the same substance for the same
        endocrine effect, develop, as appropriate, procedures for fair
        and equitable sharing of test costs, and develop, as necessary,
        procedures for handling of confidential business information.
        (C) Failure of registrants to submit information
          (i) Suspension
            If a registrant of a substance referred to in paragraph
          (3)(A) fails to comply with an order under subparagraph (A)
          of this paragraph, the Administrator shall issue a notice of
          intent to suspend the sale or distribution of the substance
          by the registrant. Any suspension proposed under this
          paragraph shall become final at the end of the 30-day period
          beginning on the date that the registrant receives the notice
          of intent to suspend, unless during that period a person
          adversely affected by the notice requests a hearing or the
          Administrator determines that the registrant has complied
          fully with this paragraph.
          (ii) Hearing
            If a person requests a hearing under clause (i), the
          hearing shall be conducted in accordance with section 554 of
          title 5. The only matter for resolution at the hearing shall
          be whether the registrant has failed to comply with an order
          under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph. A decision by the
          Administrator after completion of a hearing shall be
          considered to be a final agency action.
          (iii) Termination of suspensions
            The Administrator shall terminate a suspension under this
          subparagraph issued with respect to a registrant if the
          Administrator determines that the registrant has complied
          fully with this paragraph.
        (D) Noncompliance by other persons
          Any person (other than a registrant) who fails to comply with
        an order under subparagraph (A) shall be liable for the same
        penalties and sanctions as are provided under section 16 of the
        Toxic Substances Control Act [15 U.S.C. 2615] in the case of a
        violation referred to in that section. Such penalties and
        sanctions shall be assessed and imposed in the same manner as
        provided in such section 16.
      (6) Agency action
        In the case of any substance that is found, as a result of
      testing and evaluation under this section, to have an endocrine
      effect on humans, the Administrator shall, as appropriate, take
      action under such statutory authority as is available to the
      Administrator, including consideration under other sections of
      this chapter, as is necessary to ensure the protection of public
      health.
      (7) Report to Congress
        Not later than 4 years after August 3, 1996, the Administrator
      shall prepare and submit to Congress a report containing - 
          (A) the findings of the Administrator resulting from the
        screening program described in paragraph (1);
          (B) recommendations for further testing needed to evaluate
        the impact on human health of the substances tested under the
        screening program; and
          (C) recommendations for any further actions (including any
        action described in paragraph (6)) that the Administrator
        determines are appropriate based on the findings.
    (q) Schedule for review
      (1) In general
        The Administrator shall review tolerances and exemptions for
      pesticide chemical residues in effect on the day before August 3,
      1996, as expeditiously as practicable, assuring that - 
          (A) 33 percent of such tolerances and exemptions are reviewed
        within 3 years of August 3, 1996;
          (B) 66 percent of such tolerances and exemptions are reviewed
        within 6 years of August 3, 1996; and
          (C) 100 percent of such tolerances and exemptions are
        reviewed within 10 years of August 3, 1996.

      In conducting a review of a tolerance or exemption, the
      Administrator shall determine whether the tolerance or exemption
      meets the requirements of subsections (!3) (b)(2) or (c)(2) of
      this section and shall, by the deadline for the review of the
      tolerance or exemption, issue a regulation under subsection
      (d)(4) or (e)(1) of this section to modify or revoke the
      tolerance or exemption if the tolerance or exemption does not
      meet such requirements.

      (2) Priorities
        In determining priorities for reviewing tolerances and
      exemptions under paragraph (1), the Administrator shall give
      priority to the review of the tolerances or exemptions that
      appear to pose the greatest risk to public health.
      (3) Publication of schedule
        Not later than 12 months after August 3, 1996, the
      Administrator shall publish a schedule for review of tolerances
      and exemptions established prior to August 3, 1996. The
      determination of priorities for the review of tolerances and
      exemptions pursuant to this subsection is not a rulemaking and
      shall not be subject to judicial review, except that failure to
      take final action pursuant to the schedule established by this
      paragraph shall be subject to judicial review.
    (r) Temporary tolerance or exemption
      The Administrator may, upon the request of any person who has
    obtained an experimental permit for a pesticide chemical under the
    Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act [7 U.S.C. 136
    et seq.] or upon the Administrator's own initiative, establish a
    temporary tolerance or exemption for the pesticide chemical residue
    for the uses covered by the permit. Subsections (b)(2), (c)(2),
    (d), and (e) of this section shall apply to actions taken under
    this subsection.
    (s) Savings clause
      Nothing in this section shall be construed to amend or modify the
    provisions of the Toxic Substances Control Act [15 U.S.C. 2601 et
    seq.] or the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act [7
    U.S.C. 136 et seq.].

      to one or more proposed uses of the food additive involved, the
      conditions under which such additive may be safely used
      (including, but not limited to, specifications as to the
      particular food or classes of food in or in which such additive
      may be used, the maximum quantity which may be used or permitted
      to remain in or on such food, the manner in which such additive
      may be added to or used in or on such food, and any directions or
      other labeling or packaging requirements for such additive deemed
      necessary by him to assure the safety of such use), and shall
      notify the petitioner of such order and the reasons for such
      action; or
        (B) by order deny the petition, and shall notify the petitioner
      of such order and of the reasons for such action.

      (2) The order required by paragraph (1)(A) or (B) of this
    subsection shall be issued within ninety days after the date of
    filing of the petition, except that the Secretary may (prior to
    such ninetieth day), by written notice to the petitioner, extend
    such ninety-day period to such time (not more than one hundred and
    eighty days after the date of filing of the petition) as the
    Secretary deems necessary to enable him to study and investigate
    the petition.
      (3) No such regulation shall issue if a fair evaluation of the
    data before the Secretary - 
        (A) fails to establish that the proposed use of the food
      additive, under the conditions of use to be specified in the
      regulation, will be safe: Provided, That no additive shall be
      deemed to be safe if it is found to induce cancer when ingested
      by man or animal, or if it is found, after tests which are
      appropriate for the evaluation of the safety of food additives,
      to induce cancer in man or animal, except that this proviso shall
      not apply with respect to the use of a substance as an ingredient
      of feed for animals which are raised for food production, if the
      Secretary finds (i) that, under the conditions of use and feeding
      specified in proposed labeling and reasonably certain to be
      followed in practice, such additive will not adversely affect the
      animals for which such feed is intended, and (ii) that no residue
      of the additive will be found (by methods of examination
      prescribed or approved by the Secretary by regulations, which
      regulations shall not be subject to subsections (f) and (g) of
      this section) in any edible portion of such animal after
      slaughter or in any food yielded by or derived from the living
      animal; or
        (B) shows that the proposed use of the additive would promote
      deception of the consumer in violation of this chapter or would
      otherwise result in adulteration or in misbranding of food within
      the meaning of this chapter.

      (4) If, in the judgment of the Secretary, based upon a fair
    evaluation of the data before him, a tolerance limitation is
    required in order to assure that the proposed use of an additive
    will be safe, the Secretary - 
        (A) shall not fix such tolerance limitation at a level higher
      than he finds to be reasonably required to accomplish the
      physical or other technical effect for which such additive is
      intended; and
        (B) shall not establish a regulation for such proposed use if
      he finds upon a fair evaluation of the data before him that such
      data do not establish that such use would accomplish the intended
      physical or other technical effect.

      (5) In determining, for the purposes of this section, whether a
    proposed use of a food additive is safe, the Secretary shall
    consider among other relevant factors - 
        (A) the probable consumption of the additive and of any
      substance formed in or on food because of the use of the
      additive;
        (B) the cumulative effect of such additive in the diet of man
      or animals, taking into account any chemically or
      pharmacologically related substance or substances in such diet;
      and
        (C) safety factors which in the opinion of experts qualified by
      scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety of food
      additives are generally recognized as appropriate for the use of
      animal experimentation data.
    (d) Regulation issued on Secretary's initiative
      The Secretary may at any time, upon his own initiative, propose
    the issuance of a regulation prescribing, with respect to any
    particular use of a food additive, the conditions under which such
    additive may be safely used, and the reasons therefor. After the
    thirtieth day following publication of such a proposal, the
    Secretary may by order establish a regulation based upon the
    proposal.
    (e) Publication and effective date of orders
      Any order, including any regulation established by such order,
    issued under subsection (c) or (d) of this section, shall be
    published and shall be effective upon publication, but the
    Secretary may stay such effectiveness if, after issuance of such
    order, a hearing is sought with respect to such order pursuant to
    subsection (f) of this section.
    (f) Objections and public hearing; basis and contents of order;
      statement
      (1) Within thirty days after publication of an order made
    pursuant to subsection (c) or (d) of this section, any person
    adversely affected by such an order may file objections thereto
    with the Secretary, specifying with particularity the provisions of
    the order deemed objectionable, stating reasonable grounds
    therefor, and requesting a public hearing upon such objections. The
    Secretary shall, after due notice, as promptly as possible hold
    such public hearing for the purpose of receiving evidence relevant
    and material to the issues raised by such objections. As soon as
    practicable after completion of the hearing, the Secretary shall by
    order act upon such objections and make such order public.
      (2) Such order shall be based upon a fair evaluation of the
    entire record at such hearing, and shall include a statement
    setting forth in detail the findings and conclusions upon which the
    order is based.
      (3) The Secretary shall specify in the order the date on which it
    shall take effect, except that it shall not be made to take effect
    prior to the ninetieth day after its publication, unless the
    Secretary finds that emergency conditions exist necessitating an
    earlier effective date, in which event the Secretary shall specify
    in the order his findings as to such conditions.
    (g) Judicial review
      (1) In a case of actual controversy as to the validity of any
    order issued under subsection (f) of this section, including any
    order thereunder with respect to amendment or repeal of a
    regulation issued under this section, any person who will be
    adversely affected by such order may obtain judicial review by
    filing in the United States Court of Appeals for the circuit
    wherein such person resides or has his principal place of business,
    or in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of
    Columbia Circuit, within sixty days after the entry of such order,
    a petition praying that the order be set aside in whole or in part.
      (2) A copy of such petition shall be forthwith transmitted by the
    clerk of the court to the Secretary, or any officer designated by
    him for that purpose, and thereupon the Secretary shall file in the
    court the record of the proceedings on which he based his order, as
    provided in section 2112 of title 28. Upon the filing of such
    petition the court shall have jurisdiction, which upon the filing
    of the record with it shall be exclusive, to affirm or set aside
    the order complained of in whole or in part. Until the filing of
    the record the Secretary may modify or set aside his order. The
    findings of the Secretary with respect to questions of fact shall
    be sustained if based upon a fair evaluation of the entire record
    at such hearing.
      (3) The court, on such judicial review, shall not sustain the
    order of the Secretary if he failed to comply with any requirement
    imposed on him by subsection (f)(2) of this section.
      (4) If application is made to the court for leave to adduce
    additional evidence, the court may order such additional evidence
    to be taken before the Secretary and to be adduced upon the hearing
    in such manner and upon such terms and conditions as to the court
    may seem proper, if such evidence is material and there were
    reasonable grounds for failure to adduce such evidence in the
    proceedings below. The Secretary may modify his findings as to the
    facts and order by reason of the additional evidence so taken, and
    shall file with the court such modified findings and order.
      (5) The judgment of the court affirming or setting aside, in
    whole or in part, any order under this section shall be final,
    subject to review by the Supreme Court of the United States upon
    certiorari or certification as provided in section 1254 of title
    28. The commencement of proceedings under this section shall not,
    unless specifically ordered by the court to the contrary, operate
    as a stay of an order.
    (h) Notification relating to food contact substance
      (1) Subject to such regulations as may be promulgated under
    paragraph (3), a manufacturer or supplier of a food contact
    substance may, at least 120 days prior to the introduction or
    delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of the food
    contact substance, notify the Secretary of the identity and
    intended use of the food contact substance, and of the
    determination of the manufacturer or supplier that the intended use
    of such food contact substance is safe under the standard described
    in subsection (c)(3)(A) of this section. The notification shall
    contain the information that forms the basis of the determination
    and all information required to be submitted by regulations
    promulgated by the Secretary.
      (2)(A) A notification submitted under paragraph (1) shall become
    effective 120 days after the date of receipt by the Secretary and
    the food contact substance may be introduced or delivered for
    introduction into interstate commerce, unless the Secretary makes a
    determination within the 120-day period that, based on the data and
    information before the Secretary, such use of the food contact
    substance has not been shown to be safe under the standard
    described in subsection (c)(3)(A) of this section, and informs the
    manufacturer or supplier of such determination.
      (B) A decision by the Secretary to object to a notification shall
    constitute final agency action subject to judicial review.
      (C) In this paragraph, the term "food contact substance" means
    the substance that is the subject of a notification submitted under
    paragraph (1), and does not include a similar or identical
    substance manufactured or prepared by a person other than the
    manufacturer identified in the notification.
      (3)(A) The process in this subsection shall be utilized for
    authorizing the marketing of a food contact substance except where
    the Secretary determines that submission and review of a petition
    under subsection (b) of this section is necessary to provide
    adequate assurance of safety, or where the Secretary and any
    manufacturer or supplier agree that such manufacturer or supplier
    may submit a petition under subsection (b) of this section.
      (B) The Secretary is authorized to promulgate regulations to
    identify the circumstances in which a petition shall be filed under
    subsection (b) of this section, and shall consider criteria such as
    the probable consumption of such food contact substance and
    potential toxicity of the food contact substance in determining the
    circumstances in which a petition shall be filed under subsection
    (b) of this section.
      (4) The Secretary shall keep confidential any information
    provided in a notification under paragraph (1) for 120 days after
    receipt by the Secretary of the notification. After the expiration
    of such 120 days, the information shall be available to any
    interested party except for any matter in the notification that is
    a trade secret or confidential commercial information.
      (5)(A)(i) Except as provided in clause (ii), the notification
    program established under this subsection shall not operate in any
    fiscal year unless - 
        (I) an appropriation equal to or exceeding the applicable
      amount under clause (iv) is made for such fiscal year for
      carrying out such program in such fiscal year; and
        (II) the Secretary certifies that the amount appropriated for
      such fiscal year for the Center for Food Safety and Applied
      Nutrition of the Food and Drug Administration (exclusive of the
      appropriation referred to in subclause (I)) equals or exceeds the
      amount appropriated for the Center for fiscal year 1997,
      excluding any amount appropriated for new programs.

      fiscal year 1999 for carrying out such program during such
      period; and
        (II) the Secretary certifies that the amount appropriated for
      such period for the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition
      of the Food and Drug Administration (exclusive of the
      appropriation referred to in subclause (I)) equals or exceeds an
      amount equivalent to one-half the amount appropriated for the
      Center for fiscal year 1997, excluding any amount appropriated
      for new programs.

      (iii) For the last six months of fiscal year 1999, the applicable

    the budget request of the President for the six-month period
    involved for carrying out the notification program in fiscal year
    1999, whichever is less.
      (iv) For fiscal year 2000 and subsequent fiscal years, the
    applicable amount under this clause is $3,000,000, or the amount
    specified in the budget request of the President for the fiscal
    year involved for carrying out the notification program under this
    subsection, whichever is less.
      (B) For purposes of carrying out the notification program under
    this subsection, there are authorized to be appropriated such sums
    as may be necessary for each of the fiscal years 1999 through
    fiscal year 2003, except that such authorization of appropriations
    is not effective for a fiscal year for any amount that is less than
    the applicable amount under clause (iii) or (iv) of subparagraph
    (A), whichever is applicable.
      (C) Not later than April 1 of fiscal year 1998 and February 1 of
    each subsequent fiscal year, the Secretary shall submit a report to
    the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives
    and the Senate, the Committee on Commerce of the House of
    Representatives, and the Committee on Labor and Human Resources of
    the Senate that provides an estimate of the Secretary of the costs
    of carrying out the notification program established under this
    subsection for the next fiscal year.
      (6) In this section, the term "food contact substance" means any
    substance intended for use as a component of materials used in
    manufacturing, packing, packaging, transporting, or holding food if
    such use is not intended to have any technical effect in such food.
    (i) Amendment or repeal of regulations
      The Secretary shall by regulation prescribe the procedure by
    which regulations under the foregoing provisions of this section
    may be amended or repealed, and such procedure shall conform to the

-STATUTE-
      (a) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section,
    whenever the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency
    prescribes interim or revised national primary drinking water
    regulations under section 1412 of the Public Health Service Act [42
    U.S.C. 300g-1], the Secretary shall consult with the Administrator
    and within 180 days after the promulgation of such drinking water
    regulations either promulgate amendments to regulations under this
    chapter applicable to bottled drinking water or publish in the
    Federal Register his reasons for not making such amendments.
      (b)(1) Not later than 180 days before the effective date of a
    national primary drinking water regulation promulgated by the
    Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency for a
    contaminant under section 1412 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42
    U.S.C. 300g-1), the Secretary shall promulgate a standard of
    quality regulation under this subsection for that contaminant in
    bottled water or make a finding that such a regulation is not
    necessary to protect the public health because the contaminant is
    contained in water in public water systems (as defined under
    section 1401(4) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 300f(4))) but not in water
    used for bottled drinking water. The effective date for any such
    standard of quality regulation shall be the same as the effective
    date for such national primary drinking water regulation, except
    for any standard of quality of regulation promulgated by the
    Secretary before August 6, 1996, for which (as of August 6, 1996)
    an effective date had not been established. In the case of a
    standard of quality regulation to which such exception applies, the
    Secretary shall promulgate monitoring requirements for the
    contaminants covered by the regulation not later than 2 years after
    August 6, 1996.
      (2) A regulation issued by the Secretary as provided in this
    subsection shall include any monitoring requirements that the
    Secretary determines appropriate for bottled water.
      (3) A regulation issued by the Secretary as provided in this
    subsection shall require the following:
        (A) In the case of contaminants for which a maximum contaminant
      level is established in a national primary drinking water
      regulation under section 1412 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42
      U.S.C. 300g-1), the regulation under this subsection shall
      establish a maximum contaminant level for the contaminant in
      bottled water which is no less stringent than the maximum
      contaminant level provided in the national primary drinking water
      regulation.
        (B) In the case of contaminants for which a treatment technique
      is established in a national primary drinking water regulation
      under section 1412 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300g-
      1), the regulation under this subsection shall require that
      bottled water be subject to requirements no less protective of
      the public health than those applicable to water provided by
      public water systems using the treatment technique required by
      the national primary drinking water regulation.

      (4)(A) If the Secretary does not promulgate a regulation under
    this subsection within the period described in paragraph (1), the
    national primary drinking water regulation referred to in paragraph
    (1) shall be considered, as of the date on which the Secretary is
    required to establish a regulation under paragraph (1), as the
    regulation applicable under this subsection to bottled water.
      (B) In the case of a national primary drinking water regulation
    that pursuant to subparagraph (A) is considered to be a standard of
    quality regulation, the Secretary shall, not later than the
    applicable date referred to in such subparagraph, publish in the
    Federal Register a notice - 
        (i) specifying the contents of such regulation, including
      monitoring requirements; and
        (ii) providing that for purposes of this paragraph the
      effective date for such regulation is the same as the effective
      date for the regulation for purposes of the Safe Drinking Water
      Act [42 U.S.C. 300f et seq.] (or, if the exception under
      paragraph (1) applies to the regulation, that the effective date
      for the regulation is not later than 2 years and 180 days after
      August 6, 1996).

-STATUTE-
    (a) Adulteration
      An infant formula, including an infant formula powder, shall be
    deemed to be adulterated if - 
        (1) such infant formula does not provide nutrients as required
      by subsection (i) of this section,
        (2) such infant formula does not meet the quality factor
      requirements prescribed by the Secretary under subsection (b)(1)
      of this section, or
        (3) the processing of such infant formula is not in compliance
      with the good manufacturing practices and the quality control
      procedures prescribed by the Secretary under subsection (b)(2) of
      this section.
    (b) Requirements for quality factors, good manufacturing practices,
      and retention of records

    quality factors for infant formulas to the extent possible
    consistent with current scientific knowledge, including quality
    factor requirements for the nutrients required by subsection (i) of
    this section.
      (2)(A) The Secretary shall by regulation establish good
    manufacturing practices for infant formulas, including quality
    control procedures that the Secretary determines are necessary to
    assure that an infant formula provides nutrients in accordance with
    this subsection and subsection (i) of this section and is
    manufactured in a manner designed to prevent adulteration of the
    infant formula.
      (B) The good manufacturing practices and quality control
    procedures prescribed by the Secretary under subparagraph (A) shall
    include requirements for - 
        (i) the testing, in accordance with paragraph (3) and by the
      manufacturer of an infant formula or an agent of such
      manufacturer, of each batch of infant formula for each nutrient
      required by subsection (i) of this section before the
      distribution of such batch,
        (ii) regularly scheduled testing, by the manufacturer of an
      infant formula or an agent of such manufacturer, of samples of
      infant formulas during the shelf life of such formulas to ensure
      that such formulas are in compliance with this section,
        (iii) in-process controls including, where necessary, testing
      required by good manufacturing practices designed to prevent
      adulteration of each batch of infant formula, and
        (iv) the conduct by the manufacturer of an infant formula or an
      agent of such manufacturer of regularly scheduled audits to
      determine that such manufacturer has complied with the
      regulations prescribed under subparagraph (A).

    In prescribing requirements for audits under clause (iv), the
    Secretary shall provide that such audits be conducted by
    appropriately trained individuals who do not have any direct
    responsibility for the manufacture or production of infant formula.
      (3)(A) At the final product stage, each batch of infant formula
    shall be tested for vitamin A, vitamin B1, vitamin C, and vitamin E
    to ensure that such infant formula is in compliance with the
    requirements of this subsection and subsection (i) of this section
    relating to such vitamins.
      (B) Each nutrient premix used in the manufacture of an infant
    formula shall be tested for each relied upon nutrient required by
    subsection (i) of this section which is contained in such premix to
    ensure that such premix is in compliance with its specifications or
    certifications by a premix supplier.
      (C) During the manufacturing process or at the final product
    stage and before distribution of an infant formula, an infant
    formula shall be tested for all nutrients required to be included
    in such formula by subsection (i) of this section for which testing
    has not been conducted pursuant to subparagraph (A) or (B). Testing
    under this subparagraph shall be conducted to - 
        (i) ensure that each batch of such infant formula is in
      compliance with the requirements of subsection (i) of this
      section relating to such nutrients, and
        (ii) confirm that nutrients contained in any nutrient premix
      used in such infant formula are present in each batch of such
      infant formula in the proper concentration.

      (D) If the Secretary adds a nutrient to the list of nutrients in
    the table in subsection (i) of this section, the Secretary shall by
    regulation require that the manufacturer of an infant formula test
    each batch of such formula for such new nutrient in accordance with
    subparagraph (A), (B), or (C).
      (E) For purposes of this paragraph, the term "final product
    stage" means the point in the manufacturing process, before
    distribution of an infant formula, at which an infant formula is
    homogenous and is not subject to further degradation.
      (4)(A) The Secretary shall by regulation establish requirements
    respecting the retention of records. Such requirements shall
    provide for - 
        (i) the retention of all records necessary to demonstrate

      analysis by premix suppliers,
        (iii) the retention by a premix supplier of all records
      necessary to confirm the accuracy of all premix certifications
      and guarantees of analysis,
        (iv) the retention of - 
          (I) all records pertaining to the microbiological quality and
        purity of raw materials used in infant formula powder and in
        finished infant formula, and
          (II) all records pertaining to food packaging materials which
        show that such materials do not cause an infant formula to be
        adulterated within the meaning of section 342(a)(2)(C) of this
        title,

        (v) the retention of all records of the results of regularly
      scheduled audits conducted pursuant to the requirements
      prescribed by the Secretary under paragraph (2)(B)(iv), and
        (vi) the retention of all complaints and the maintenance of
      files with respect to, and the review of, complaints concerning
      infant formulas which may reveal the possible existence of a
      hazard to health.

      (B)(i) Records required under subparagraph (A) with respect to an
    infant formula shall be retained for at least one year after the
    expiration of the shelf life of such infant formula. Except as
    provided in clause (ii), such records shall be made available to
    the Secretary for review and duplication upon request of the
    Secretary.
      (ii) A manufacturer need only provide written assurances to the
    Secretary that the regularly scheduled audits required by paragraph

      into interstate commerce, registered with the Secretary the name
      of such person, the place of business of such person, and all
      establishments at which such person intends to manufacture such
      new infant formula, and
        (B) such person has at least 90 days before marketing such new
      infant formula, made the submission to the Secretary required by
      subsection (c)(1) of this section.

      (2) For purposes of paragraph (1), the term "new infant formula"
    includes - 
        (A) an infant formula manufactured by a person which has not
      previously manufactured an infant formula, and
        (B) an infant formula manufactured by a person which has
      previously manufactured infant formula and in which there is a
      major change, in processing or formulation, from a current or any
      previous formulation produced by such manufacturer.

    For purposes of this paragraph, the term "major change" has the
    meaning given to such term in section 106.30(c)(2) of title 21,
    Code of Federal Regulations (as in effect on August 1, 1986), and
    guidelines issued thereunder.
    (d) Submission of information about new infant formula required
      (1) A person shall, with respect to any infant formula subject to
    subsection (c) of this section, make a submission to the Secretary
    which shall include - 
        (A) the quantitative formulation of the infant formula,
        (B) a description of any reformulation of the formula or change
      in processing of the infant formula,
        (C) assurances that the infant formula will not be marketed
      unless it meets the requirements of subsections (b)(1) and (i) of
      this section, as demonstrated by the testing required under
      subsection (b)(3) of this section, and
        (D) assurances that the processing of the infant formula
      complies with subsection (b)(2) of this section.

      (2) After the first production of an infant formula subject to
    subsection (c) of this section, and before the introduction into
    interstate commerce of such formula, the manufacturer of such
    formula shall submit to the Secretary, in such form as may be
    prescribed by the Secretary, a written verification which
    summarizes test results and records demonstrating that such formula
    complies with the requirements of subsections (b)(1), (b)(2)(A),
    (b)(2)(B)(i), (b)(2)(B)(iii), (b)(3)(A), (b)(3)(C), and (i) of this
    section.
      (3) If the manufacturer of an infant formula for commercial or
    charitable distribution for human consumption determines that a
    change in the formulation of the formula or a change in the
    processing of the formula may affect whether the formula is
    adulterated under subsection (a) of this section, the manufacturer
    shall, before the first processing of such formula, make the
    submission to the Secretary required by paragraph (1).
    (e) Additional notice requirements for manufacturer
      (1) If the manufacturer of an infant formula has knowledge which
    reasonably supports the conclusion that an infant formula which has
    been processed by the manufacturer and which has left an
    establishment subject to the control of the manufacturer - 
        (A) may not provide the nutrients required by subsection (i) of
      this section, or
        (B) may be otherwise adulterated or misbranded,

    the manufacturer shall promptly notify the Secretary of such
    knowledge. If the Secretary determines that the infant formula
    presents a risk to human health, the manufacturer shall immediately
    take all actions necessary to recall shipments of such infant
    formula from all wholesale and retail establishments, consistent
    with recall regulations and guidelines issued by the Secretary.
      (2) For purposes of paragraph (1), the term "knowledge" as
    applied to a manufacturer means (A) the actual knowledge that the
    manufacturer had, or (B) the knowledge which a reasonable person
    would have had under like circumstances or which would have been
    obtained upon the exercise of due care.
    (f) Procedures applicable to recalls by manufacturer; regulatory
      oversight
      (1) If a recall of infant formula is begun by a manufacturer, the
    recall shall be carried out in accordance with such requirements as
    the Secretary shall prescribe under paragraph (2) and - 
        (A) the Secretary shall, not later than the 15th day after the
      beginning of such recall and at least once every 15 days
      thereafter until the recall is terminated, review the actions
      taken under the recall to determine whether the recall meets the
      requirements prescribed under paragraph (2), and
        (B) the manufacturer shall, not later than the 14th day after
      the beginning of such recall and at least once every 14 days
      thereafter until the recall is terminated, report to the
      Secretary the actions taken to implement the recall.

      (2) The Secretary shall by regulation prescribe the scope and
    extent of recalls of infant formulas necessary and appropriate for
    the degree of risks to human health presented by the formula
    subject to the recall.
      (3) The Secretary shall by regulation require each manufacturer
    of an infant formula who begins a recall of such formula because of
    a risk to human health to request each retail establishment at
    which such formula is sold or available for sale to post at the
    point of purchase of such formula a notice of such recall at such
    establishment for such time that the Secretary determines necessary
    to inform the public of such recall.
    (g) Recordkeeping requirements for manufacturer; regulatory
      oversight and enforcement
      (1) Each manufacturer of an infant formula shall make and retain
    such records respecting the distribution of the infant formula
    through any establishment owned or operated by such manufacturer as
    may be necessary to effect and monitor recalls of the formula. Such
    records shall be retained for at least one year after the
    expiration of the shelf life of the infant formula.
      (2) To the extent that the Secretary determines that records are
    not being made or maintained in accordance with paragraph (1), the
    Secretary may by regulation prescribe the records required to be
    made under paragraph (1) and requirements respecting the retention
    of such records under such paragraph. Such regulations shall take
    effect on such date as the Secretary prescribes but not sooner than
    the 180th day after the date such regulations are promulgated. Such
    regulations shall apply only with respect to distributions of
    infant formulas made after such effective date.
    (h) Exemptions; regulatory oversight
      (1) Any infant formula which is represented and labeled for use
    by an infant - 
        (A) who has an inborn error of metabolism or a low birth
      weight, or
        (B) who otherwise has an unusual medical or dietary problem,

    is exempt from the requirements of subsections (a), (b), and (c) of
    this section. The manufacturer of an infant formula exempt under
    this paragraph shall, in the case of the exempt formula, be
    required to provide the notice required by subsection (e)(1) of
    this section only with respect to adulteration or misbranding
    described in subsection (e)(1)(B) of this section and to comply
    with the regulations prescribed by the Secretary under paragraph
    (2).
      (2) The Secretary may by regulation establish terms and
    conditions for the exemption of an infant formula from the
    requirements of subsections (a), (b), and (c) of this section. An
    exemption of an infant formula under paragraph (1) may be withdrawn
    by the Secretary if such formula is not in compliance with
    applicable terms and conditions prescribed under this paragraph.
    (i) Nutrient requirements
      (1) An infant formula shall contain nutrients in accordance with
    the table set out in this subsection or, if revised by the
    Secretary under paragraph (2), as so revised.
      (2) The Secretary may by regulation - 
        (A) revise the list of nutrients in the table in this
      subsection, and
        (B) revise the required level for any nutrient required by the
      table.

-STATUTE-
    (a) In general
      A dietary supplement which contains a new dietary ingredient
    shall be deemed adulterated under section 342(f) of this title
    unless it meets one of the following requirements:
        (1) The dietary supplement contains only dietary ingredients
      which have been present in the food supply as an article used for
      food in a form in which the food has not been chemically altered.
        (2) There is a history of use or other evidence of safety
      establishing that the dietary ingredient when used under the
      conditions recommended or suggested in the labeling of the
      dietary supplement will reasonably be expected to be safe and, at
      least 75 days before being introduced or delivered for
      introduction into interstate commerce, the manufacturer or
      distributor of the dietary ingredient or dietary supplement
      provides the Secretary with information, including any citation
      to published articles, which is the basis on which the
      manufacturer or distributor has concluded that a dietary
      supplement containing such dietary ingredient will reasonably be
      expected to be safe.

    The Secretary shall keep confidential any information provided
    under paragraph (2) for 90 days following its receipt. After the
    expiration of such 90 days, the Secretary shall place such
    information on public display, except matters in the information
    which are trade secrets or otherwise confidential, commercial
    information.
    (b) Petition
      Any person may file with the Secretary a petition proposing the
    issuance of an order prescribing the conditions under which a new
    dietary ingredient under its intended conditions of use will
    reasonably be expected to be safe. The Secretary shall make a
    decision on such petition within 180 days of the date the petition
    is filed with the Secretary. For purposes of chapter 7 of title 5,
    the decision of the Secretary shall be considered final agency
    action.
    (c) "New dietary ingredient" defined
      For purposes of this section, the term "new dietary ingredient"
    means a dietary ingredient that was not marketed in the United
    States before October 15, 1994 and does not include any dietary
    ingredient which was marketed in the United States before October
    15, 1994.

    Sec. 350c. Maintenance and inspection of records

-STATUTE-
    (a) Records inspection
      If the Secretary has a reasonable belief that an article of food
    is adulterated and presents a threat of serious adverse health
    consequences or death to humans or animals, each person (excluding
    farms and restaurants) who manufactures, processes, packs,
    distributes, receives, holds, or imports such article shall, at the
    request of an officer or employee duly designated by the Secretary,
    permit such officer or employee, upon presentation of appropriate
    credentials and a written notice to such person, at reasonable
    times and within reasonable limits and in a reasonable manner, to
    have access to and copy all records relating to such article that
    are needed to assist the Secretary in determining whether the food
    is adulterated and presents a threat of serious adverse health
    consequences or death to humans or animals. The requirement under
    the preceding sentence applies to all records relating to the
    manufacture, processing, packing, distribution, receipt, holding,
    or importation of such article maintained by or on behalf of such
    person in any format (including paper and electronic formats) and
    at any location.
    (b) Regulations concerning recordkeeping
      The Secretary, in consultation and coordination, as appropriate,
    with other Federal departments and agencies with responsibilities
    for regulating food safety, may by regulation establish
    requirements regarding the establishment and maintenance, for not
    longer than two years, of records by persons (excluding farms and
    restaurants) who manufacture, process, pack, transport, distribute,
    receive, hold, or import food, which records are needed by the
    Secretary for inspection to allow the Secretary to identify the
    immediate previous sources and the immediate subsequent recipients
    of food, including its packaging, in order to address credible
    threats of serious adverse health consequences or death to humans
    or animals. The Secretary shall take into account the size of a
    business in promulgating regulations under this section.
    (c) Protection of sensitive information
      The Secretary shall take appropriate measures to ensure that
    there are in effect effective procedures to prevent the
    unauthorized disclosure of any trade secret or confidential
    information that is obtained by the Secretary pursuant to this
    section.
    (d) Limitations
      This section shall not be construed - 
        (1) to limit the authority of the Secretary to inspect records
      or to require establishment and maintenance of records under any
      other provision of this chapter;
        (2) to authorize the Secretary to impose any requirements with
      respect to a food to the extent that it is within the exclusive
      jurisdiction of the Secretary of Agriculture pursuant to the
      Federal Meat Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), the Poultry
      Products Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 451 et seq.), or the Egg
      Products Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 1031 et seq.);
        (3) to have any legal effect on section 552 of title 5 or
      section 1905 of title 18; or
        (4) to extend to recipes for food, financial data, pricing
      data, personnel data, research data, or sales data (other than
      shipment data regarding sales).

      (1) In general
        The Secretary shall by regulation require that any facility
      engaged in manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding food
      for consumption in the United States be registered with the
      Secretary. To be registered - 
          (A) for a domestic facility, the owner, operator, or agent in
        charge of the facility shall submit a registration to the

        Secretary and shall include with the registration the name of
        the United States agent for the facility.
      (2) Registration
        An entity (referred to in this section as the "registrant")
      shall submit a registration under paragraph (1) to the Secretary
      containing information necessary to notify the Secretary of the
      name and address of each facility at which, and all trade names
      under which, the registrant conducts business and, when
      determined necessary by the Secretary through guidance, the
      general food category (as identified under section 170.3 of title
      21, Code of Federal Regulations) of any food manufactured,
      processed, packed, or held at such facility. The registrant shall
      notify the Secretary in a timely manner of changes to such
      information.
      (3) Procedure
        Upon receipt of a completed registration described in paragraph
      (1), the Secretary shall notify the registrant of the receipt of
      such registration and assign a registration number to each
      registered facility.
      (4) List
        The Secretary shall compile and maintain an up-to-date list of
      facilities that are registered under this section. Such list and
      any registration documents submitted pursuant to this subsection
      shall not be subject to disclosure under section 552 of title 5.
      Information derived from such list or registration documents
      shall not be subject to disclosure under section 552 of title 5

        (1) The term "facility" includes any factory, warehouse, or
      establishment (including a factory, warehouse, or establishment

      food. Such term does not include farms; restaurants; other retail
      food establishments; nonprofit food establishments in which food
      is prepared for or served directly to the consumer; or fishing
      vessels (except such vessels engaged in processing as defined in
      section 123.3(k) of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations).
        (2) The term "domestic facility" means a facility located in
      any of the States or Territories.
        (3)(A) The term "foreign facility" means a facility that
      manufacturers, processes, packs, or holds food, but only if food
      from such facility is exported to the United States without
      further processing or packaging outside the United States.
        (B) A food may not be considered to have undergone further
      processing or packaging for purposes of subparagraph (A) solely
      on the basis that labeling was added or that any similar activity
      of a de minimis nature was carried out with respect to the food.
    (c) Rule of construction
      Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the
    Secretary to require an application, review, or licensing process.

        The term "transportation" means any movement in commerce by
      motor vehicle or rail vehicle.
    (b) Regulations
      The Secretary shall by regulation require shippers, carriers by
    motor vehicle or rail vehicle, receivers, and other persons engaged
    in the transportation of food to use sanitary transportation
    practices prescribed by the Secretary to ensure that food is not
    transported under conditions that may render the food adulterated.
    (c) Contents
      The regulations under subsection (b) of this section shall - 
        (1) prescribe such practices as the Secretary determines to be
      appropriate relating to -

        (2) include - 
          (A) a list of nonfood products that the Secretary determines
        may, if shipped in a bulk vehicle, render adulterated food that
        is subsequently transported in the same vehicle; and
          (B) a list of nonfood products that the Secretary determines
        may, if shipped in a motor vehicle or rail vehicle (other than
        a tank vehicle or bulk vehicle), render adulterated food that
        is simultaneously or subsequently transported in the same
        vehicle.
    (d) Waivers
      (1) In general
        The Secretary may waive any requirement under this section,
      with respect to any class of persons, vehicles, food, or nonfood
      products, if the Secretary determines that the waiver - 
          (A) will not result in the transportation of food under
        conditions that would be unsafe for human or animal health; and
          (B) will not be contrary to the public interest.
      (2) Publication
        The Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register any waiver
      and the reasons for the waiver.
    (e) Preemption

        subdivision and a requirement of this section, or a regulation
        prescribed under this section, is not possible; or
          (B) the requirement of the State or political subdivision as
        applied or enforced is an obstacle to accomplishing and
        carrying out this section or a regulation prescribed under this
        section.
      (2) Applicability
        This subsection applies to transportation that occurs on or
      after the effective date of the regulations promulgated under
      subsection (b) of this section.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 351. Adulterated drugs and devices

-STATUTE-
      A drug or device shall be deemed to be adulterated - 
    (a) Poisonous, insanitary, etc., ingredients; adequate controls in
      manufacture
      (1) If it consists in whole or in part of any filthy, putrid, or
    decomposed substance; or (2)(A) if it has been prepared, packed, or
    held under insanitary conditions whereby it may have been
    contaminated with filth, or whereby it may have been rendered
    injurious to health; or (B) if it is a drug and the methods used
    in, or the facilities or controls used for, its manufacture,
    processing, packing, or holding do not conform to or are not
    operated or administered in conformity with current good
    manufacturing practice to assure that such drug meets the
    requirements of this chapter as to safety and has the identity and
    strength, and meets the quality and purity characteristics, which
    it purports or is represented to possess; or (C) if it is a
    compounded positron emission tomography drug and the methods used
    in, or the facilities and controls used for, its compounding,
    processing, packing, or holding do not conform to or are not
    operated or administered in conformity with the positron emission
    tomography compounding standards and the official monographs of the
    United States Pharmacopoeia to assure that such drug meets the
    requirements of this chapter as to safety and has the identity and
    strength, and meets the quality and purity characteristics, that it
    purports or is represented to possess; or (3) if its container is
    composed, in whole or in part, of any poisonous or deleterious
    substance which may render the contents injurious to health; or (4)
    if (A) it bears or contains, for purposes of coloring only, a color
    additive which is unsafe within the meaning of section 379e(a) of
    this title, or (B) it is a color additive the intended use of which
    in or on drugs or devices is for purposes of coloring only and is
    unsafe within the meaning of section 379e(a) of this title; or (5)
    if it is a new animal drug which is unsafe within the meaning of
    section 360b of this title; or (6) if it is an animal feed bearing
    or containing a new animal drug, and such animal feed is unsafe
    within the meaning of section 360b of this title.
    (b) Strength, quality, or purity differing from official compendium
      If it purports to be or is represented as a drug the name of
    which is recognized in an official compendium, and its strength
    differs from, or its quality or purity falls below, the standard
    set forth in such compendium. Such determination as to strength,
    quality, or purity shall be made in accordance with the tests or
    methods of assay set forth in such compendium, except that whenever
    tests or methods of assay have not been prescribed in such
    compendium, or such tests or methods of assay as are prescribed
    are, in the judgment of the Secretary, insufficient for the making
    of such determination, the Secretary shall bring such fact to the
    attention of the appropriate body charged with the revision of such
    compendium, and if such body fails within a reasonable time to
    prescribe tests or methods of assay which, in the judgment of the
    Secretary, are sufficient for purposes of this paragraph, then the
    Secretary shall promulgate regulations prescribing appropriate
    tests or methods of assay in accordance with which such
    determination as to strength, quality, or purity shall be made. No
    drug defined in an official compendium shall be deemed to be
    adulterated under this paragraph because it differs from the
    standard of strength, quality, or purity therefor set forth in such
    compendium, if its difference in strength, quality, or purity from
    such standard is plainly stated on its label. Whenever a drug is
    recognized in both the United States Pharmacopoeia and the
    Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States it shall be subject
    to the requirements of the United States Pharmacopoeia unless it is
    labeled and offered for sale as a homoeopathic drug, in which case
    it shall be subject to the provisions of the Homoeopathic
    Pharmacopoeia of the United States and not to those of the United
    States Pharmacopoeia.
    (c) Misrepresentation of strength, etc., where drug is unrecognized
      in compendium
      If it is not subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this
    section and its strength differs from, or its purity or quality
    falls below, that which it purports or is represented to possess.
    (d) Mixture with or substitution of another substance
      If it is a drug and any substance has been (1) mixed or packed
    therewith so as to reduce its quality or strength or (2)
    substituted wholly or in part therefor.
    (e) Devices not in conformity with performance standards
      (1) If it is, or purports to be or is represented as, a device
    which is subject to a performance standard established under
    section 360d of this title unless such device is in all respects in
    conformity with such standard.
      (2) If it is declared to be, purports to be, or is represented
    as, a device that is in conformity with any standard recognized
    under section 360d(c) of this title unless such device is in all
    respects in conformity with such standard.
    (f) Certain class III devices
      (1) If it is a class III device - 
        (A)(i) which is required by a regulation promulgated under
      subsection (b) of section 360e of this title to have an approval
      under such section of an application for premarket approval and
      which is not exempt from section 360e of this title under section
      360j(g) of this title, and
        (ii)(I) for which an application for premarket approval or a
      notice of completion of a product development protocol was not
      filed with the Secretary within the ninety-day period beginning
      on the date of the promulgation of such regulation, or
        (II) for which such an application was filed and approval of
      the application has been denied, suspended, or withdrawn, or such
      a notice was filed and has been declared not completed or the
      approval of the device under the protocol has been withdrawn;
        (B)(i) which was classified under section 360c(f) of this title
      into class III, which under section 360e(a) of this title is
      required to have in effect an approved application for premarket
      approval, and which is not exempt from section 360e of this title
      under section 360j(g) of this title, and
        (ii) which has an application which has been suspended or is
      otherwise not in effect; or
        (C) which was classified under section 360j(l) of this title
      into class III, which under such section is required to have in
      effect an approved application under section 360e of this title,
      and which has an application which has been suspended or is
      otherwise not in effect.

      (2)(A) In the case of a device classified under section 360c(f)
    of this title into class III and intended solely for
    investigational use, paragraph (!1) (1)(B) shall not apply with
    respect to such device during the period ending on the ninetieth
    day after the date of the promulgation of the regulations
    prescribing the procedures and conditions required by section
    360j(g)(2) of this title.

      (B) In the case of a device subject to a regulation promulgated
    under subsection (b) of section 360e of this title, paragraph (!1)
    (1) shall not apply with respect to such device during the period
    ending - 
        (i) on the last day of the thirtieth calendar month beginning
      after the month in which the classification of the device in
      class III became effective under section 360c of this title, or
        (ii) on the ninetieth day after the date of the promulgation of
      such regulation,

    whichever occurs later.
    (g) Banned devices
      If it is a banned device.
    (h) Manufacture, packing, storage, or installation of device not in
      conformity with applicable requirements or conditions
      If it is a device and the methods used in, or the facilities or
    controls used for, its manufacture, packing, storage, or
    installation are not in conformity with applicable requirements
    under section 360j(f)(1) of this title or an applicable condition
    prescribed by an order under section 360j(f)(2) of this title.
    (i) Failure to comply with requirements under which device was
      exempted for investigational use
      If it is a device for which an exemption has been granted under
    section 360j(g) of this title for investigational use and the
    person who was granted such exemption or any investigator who uses
    such device under such exemption fails to comply with a requirement
    prescribed by or under such section.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 352. Misbranded drugs and devices

-STATUTE-
      A drug or device shall be deemed to be misbranded - 
    (a) False or misleading label
      If its labeling is false or misleading in any particular. Health
    care economic information provided to a formulary committee, or
    other similar entity, in the course of the committee or the entity
    carrying out its responsibilities for the selection of drugs for
    managed care or other similar organizations, shall not be
    considered to be false or misleading under this paragraph if the
    health care economic information directly relates to an indication
    approved under section 355 of this title or under section 262(a) of
    title 42 for such drug and is based on competent and reliable
    scientific evidence. The requirements set forth in section 355(a)
    of this title or in section 262(a) of title 42 shall not apply to
    health care economic information provided to such a committee or
    entity in accordance with this paragraph. Information that is
    relevant to the substantiation of the health care economic
    information presented pursuant to this paragraph shall be made
    available to the Secretary upon request. In this paragraph, the
    term "health care economic information" means any analysis that
    identifies, measures, or compares the economic consequences,
    including the costs of the represented health outcomes, of the use
    of a drug to the use of another drug, to another health care
    intervention, or to no intervention.
    (b) Package form; contents of label
      If in package form unless it bears a label containing (1) the
    name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or
    distributor; and (2) an accurate statement of the quantity of the
    contents in terms of weight, measure, or numerical count: Provided,
    That under clause (2) of this paragraph reasonable variations shall
    be permitted, and exemptions as to small packages shall be
    established, by regulations prescribed by the Secretary.
    (c) Prominence of information on label
      If any word, statement, or other information required by or under
    authority of this chapter to appear on the label or labeling is not
    prominently placed thereon with such conspicuousness (as compared
    with other words, statements, designs, or devices, in the labeling)
    and in such terms as to render it likely to be read and understood
    by the ordinary individual under customary conditions of purchase
    and use.
    (d) Repealed. Pub. L. 105-115, title I, Sec. 126(b), Nov. 21, 1997,
      111 Stat. 2327
    (e) Designation of drugs or devices by established names
      (1)(A) If it is a drug, unless its label bears, to the exclusion
    of any other nonproprietary name (except the applicable systematic
    chemical name or the chemical formula) - 
        (i) the established name (as defined in subparagraph (3)) of
      the drug, if there is such a name;
        (ii) the established name and quantity or, if determined to be
      appropriate by the Secretary, the proportion of each active
      ingredient, including the quantity, kind, and proportion of any
      alcohol, and also including whether active or not the established
      name and quantity or if determined to be appropriate by the
      Secretary, the proportion of any bromides, ether, chloroform,
      acetanilide, acetophenetidin, amidopyrine, antipyrine, atropine,
      hyoscine, hyoscyamine, arsenic, digitalis, digitalis glucosides,
      mercury, ouabain, strophanthin, strychnine, thyroid, or any
      derivative or preparation of any such substances, contained
      therein, except that the requirement for stating the quantity of
      the active ingredients, other than the quantity of those
      specifically named in this subclause, shall not apply to
      nonprescription drugs not intended for human use; and
        (iii) the established name of each inactive ingredient listed
      in alphabetical order on the outside container of the retail
      package and, if determined to be appropriate by the Secretary, on
      the immediate container, as prescribed in regulation promulgated
      by the Secretary, except that nothing in this subclause shall be
      deemed to require that any trade secret be divulged, and except
      that the requirements of this subclause with respect to
      alphabetical order shall apply only to nonprescription drugs that
      are not also cosmetics and that this subclause shall not apply to
      nonprescription drugs not intended for human use.

      (B) For any prescription drug the established name of such drug
    or ingredient, as the case may be, on such label (and on any
    labeling on which a name for such drug or ingredient is used) shall
    be printed prominently and in type at least half as large as that
    used thereon for any proprietary name or designation for such drug
    or ingredient, except that to the extent that compliance with the
    requirements of subclause (ii) or (iii) of clause (A) or this
    clause is impracticable, exemptions shall be established by
    regulations promulgated by the Secretary.
      (2) If it is a device and it has an established name, unless its
    label bears, to the exclusion of any other nonproprietary name, its
    established name (as defined in subparagraph (4)) prominently
    printed in type at least half as large as that used thereon for any
    proprietary name or designation for such device, except that to the
    extent compliance with the requirements of this subparagraph is
    impracticable, exemptions shall be established by regulations
    promulgated by the Secretary.
      (3) As used in subparagraph (1), the term "established name",
    with respect to a drug or ingredient thereof, means (A) the
    applicable official name designated pursuant to section 358 of this
    title, or (B), if there is no such name and such drug, or such
    ingredient, is an article recognized in an official compendium,
    then the official title thereof in such compendium, or (C) if
    neither clause (A) nor clause (B) of this subparagraph applies,
    then the common or usual name, if any, of such drug or of such
    ingredient, except that where clause (B) of this subparagraph
    applies to an article recognized in the United States Pharmacopeia
    and in the Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia under different official
    titles, the official title used in the United States Pharmacopeia
    shall apply unless it is labeled and offered for sale as a
    homoeopathic drug, in which case the official title used in the
    Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia shall apply.
      (4) As used in subparagraph (2), the term "established name" with
    respect to a device means (A) the applicable official name of the
    device designated pursuant to section 358 of this title, (B) if
    there is no such name and such device is an article recognized in
    an official compendium, then the official title thereof in such
    compendium, or (C) if neither clause (A) nor clause (B) of this
    subparagraph applies, then any common or usual name of such device.
    (f) Directions for use and warnings on label
      Unless its labeling bears (1) adequate directions for use; and
    (2) such adequate warnings against use in those pathological
    conditions or by children where its use may be dangerous to health,
    or against unsafe dosage or methods or duration of administration
    or application, in such manner and form, as are necessary for the
    protection of users, except that where any requirement of clause
    (1) of this paragraph, as applied to any drug or device, is not
    necessary for the protection of the public health, the Secretary
    shall promulgate regulations exempting such drug or device from
    such requirement. Required labeling for prescription devices
    intended for use in health care facilities or by a health care
    professional and required labeling for in vitro diagnostic devices
    intended for use by health care professionals or in blood

      inconsistent requirements for designation of drug
      If it purports to be a drug the name of which is recognized in an

    United States Pharmacopoeia and the Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia of
    the United States, it shall be subject to the requirements of the
    United States Pharmacopoeia with respect to packaging and labeling
    unless it is labeled and offered for sale as a homoeopathic drug,

    Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States, and not those of
    the United States Pharmacopoeia, except that in the event of

    shall by regulations require as necessary for the protection of the
    public health. No such regulation shall be established for any drug
    recognized in an official compendium until the Secretary shall have
    informed the appropriate body charged with the revision of such
    compendium of the need for such packaging or labeling requirements
    and such body shall have failed within a reasonable time to
    prescribe such requirements.

    provided that: "The Congress finds and declares that there is a
    substantial traffic in counterfeit drugs simulating the brand or
    other identifying mark or device of the manufacturer of the genuine
    article; that such traffic poses a serious hazard to the health of
    innocent consumers of such drugs because of the lack of proper
    qualifications, facilities, and manufacturing controls on the part
    of the counterfeiter, whose operations are clandestine; that, while
    such drugs are deemed misbranded within the meaning of section
    502(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [21 U.S.C.
    352(i)], the controls for the suppression of the traffic in such
    drugs are inadequate because of the difficulty of determining the
    place of interstate origin of such drugs and, if that place is
    discovered, the fact that the implements for counterfeiting are not
    subject to seizure, and that these factors require enactment of
    additional controls with respect to such drugs without regard to
    their interstate or intrastate origins."

    (a) Regulations for goods to be processed, labeled, or repacked
      elsewhere
      The Secretary is directed to promulgate regulations exempting
    from any labeling or packaging requirement of this chapter drugs
    and devices which are, in accordance with the practice of the
    trade, to be processed, labeled, or repacked in substantial
    quantities at establishments other than those where originally
    processed or packed, on condition that such drugs and devices are
    not adulterated or misbranded under the provisions of this chapter
    upon removal from such processing, labeling, or repacking
    establishment.
    (b) Prescription by physician; exemption from labeling and

      necessary to its use, is not safe for use except under the
      supervision of a practitioner licensed by law to administer such
      drug; or
        (B) is limited by an approved application under section 355 of
      this title to use under the professional supervision of a
      practitioner licensed by law to administer such drug;

    shall be dispensed only (i) upon a written prescription of a
    practitioner licensed by law to administer such drug, or (ii) upon
    an oral prescription of such practitioner which is reduced promptly
    to writing and filed by the pharmacist, or (iii) by refilling any
    such written or oral prescription if such refilling is authorized
    by the prescriber either in the original prescription or by oral
    order which is reduced promptly to writing and filed by the
    pharmacist. The act of dispensing a drug contrary to the provisions
    of this paragraph shall be deemed to be an act which results in the
    drug being misbranded while held for sale.
      (2) Any drug dispensed by filling or refilling a written or oral
    prescription of a practitioner licensed by law to administer such
    drug shall be exempt from the requirements of section 352 of this
    title, except paragraphs (a), (i)(2) and (3), (k), and (l), and the
    packaging requirements of paragraphs (g), (h), and (p), if the drug
    bears a label containing the name and address of the dispenser, the
    serial number and date of the prescription or of its filling, the
    name of the prescriber, and, if stated in the prescription, the
    name of the patient, and the directions for use and cautionary
    statements, if any, contained in such prescription. This exemption
    shall not apply to any drug dispensed in the course of the conduct
    of a business of dispensing drugs pursuant to diagnosis by mail, or
    to a drug dispensed in violation of paragraph (1) of this
    subsection.
      (3) The Secretary may by regulation remove drugs subject to
    section 355 of this title from the requirements of paragraph (1) of
    this subsection when such requirements are not necessary for the
    protection of the public health.
      (4)(A) A drug that is subject to paragraph (1) shall be deemed to
    be misbranded if at any time prior to dispensing the label of the
    drug fails to bear, at a minimum, the symbol "Rx only".
      (B) A drug to which paragraph (1) does not apply shall be deemed
    to be misbranded if at any time prior to dispensing the label of
    the drug bears the symbol described in subparagraph (A).
      (5) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to relieve any
    person from any requirement prescribed by or under authority of law
    with respect to drugs now included or which may hereafter be
    included within the classifications stated in sections 4721, 6001,
    and 6151 of title 26, or to marihuana as defined in section 4761 of

    employees of the manufacturer or distributor.
      (2) No person may sell, purchase, or trade, offer to sell,
    purchase, or trade, or counterfeit any coupon. For purposes of this

    transfers of a drug between health care entities or from a health
    care entity to a retail pharmacy undertaken to alleviate temporary
    shortages of the drug arising from delays in or interruptions of
    regular distribution schedules.
    (d) Distribution of drug samples
      (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), no person may

      form which meets the requirements of subparagraph (B), and
        (ii) under a system which requires the recipient of the drug
      sample to execute a written receipt for the drug sample upon its

      Pub. L. 104-180, title VI, Sec. 601, Aug. 6, 1996, 110 Stat.
    1593, provided that:
      "(a) In General. - Not later than 30 days after the date of
    enactment of this Act [Aug. 6, 1996], the Secretary of the
    Department of Health and Human Services shall request that national
    organizations representing health care professionals, consumer
    organizations, voluntary health agencies, the pharmaceutical
    industry, drug wholesalers, patient drug information database
    companies, and other relevant parties collaborate to develop a long-
    range comprehensive action plan to achieve goals consistent with
    the goals of the proposed rule of the Food and Drug Administration
    on 'Prescription Drug Product Labeling: Medication Guide
    Requirements' (60 Fed. Reg. 44182; relating to the provision of
    oral and written prescription information to consumers).
      "(b) Goals. - Goals consistent with the proposed rule described
    in subsection (a) are the distribution of useful written
    information to 75 percent of individuals receiving new precriptions
    [sic] by the year 2000 and to 95 percent by the year 2006.
      "(c) Plan. - The plan described in subsection (a) shall - 
        "(1) identify the plan goals;
        "(2) assess the effectiveness of the current private-sector
      approaches used to provide oral and written prescription
      information to consumers;
        "(3) develop guidelines for providing effective oral and
      written prescription information consistent with the findings of
      any such assessment;
        "(4) contain elements necessary to ensure the transmittal of
      useful information to the consuming public, including being
      scientifically accurate, non-promotional in tone and content,
      sufficiently specific and comprehensive as to adequately inform
      consumers about the use of the product, and in an understandable,
      legible format that is readily comprehensible and not confusing
      to consumers expected to use the product.[;]
        "(5) develop a mechanism to assess periodically the quality of
      the oral and written prescription information and the frequency
      with which the information is provided to consumers; and
        "(6) provide for compliance with relevant State board
      regulations.
      "(d) Limitation on the Authority of the Secretary. - The
    Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services shall have
    no authority to implement the proposed rule described in subsection
    (a), or to develop any similar regulation, policy statement, or
    other guideline specifying a uniform content or format for written
    information voluntarily provided to consumers about prescription
    drugs if, (1) not later than 120 days after the date of enactment
    of this Act [Aug. 6, 1996], the national organizations described in
    subsection (a) develop and submit to the Secretary for Health and
    Human Services a comprehensive, long-range action plan (as
    described in subsection (a)) which shall be acceptable to the
    Secretary of Health and Human Services; (2) the aforementioned plan
    is submitted to the Secretary of Health and Human Services for
    review and acceptance: Provided, That the Secretary shall give due
    consideration to the submitted plan and that any such acceptance
    shall not be arbitrarily withheld; and (3) the implementation of
    (a) a plan accepted by the Secretary commences within 30 days of
    the Secretary's acceptance of such plan, or (b) the plan submitted
    to the Secretary commences within 60 days of the submission of such
    plan if the Secretary fails to take any action on the plan within
    30 days of the submission of the plan. The Secretary shall accept,
    reject or suggest modifications to the plan submitted within 30
    days of its submission. The Secretary may confer with and assist
    private parties in the development of the plan described in
    subsections (a) and (b).
      "(e) Secretary Review. - Not later than January 1, 2001, the
    Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services shall
    review the status of private-sector initiatives designed to achieve
    the goals of the plan described in subsection (a), and if such
    goals are not achieved, the limitation in subsection (d) shall not
    apply, and the Secretary shall seek public comment on other
    initiatives that may be carried out to meet such goals."

                          CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS                      
      Section 2 of Pub. L. 100-293 provided that: "The Congress finds
    the following:
        "(1) American consumers cannot purchase prescription drugs with
      the certainty that the products are safe and effective.
        "(2) The integrity of the distribution system for prescription
      drugs is insufficient to prevent the introduction and eventual
      retail sale of substandard, ineffective, or even counterfeit
      drugs.
        "(3) The existence and operation of a wholesale submarket,
      commonly known as the 'diversion market', prevents effective
      control over or even routine knowledge of the true sources of
      prescription drugs in a significant number of cases.
        "(4) Large amounts of drugs are being reimported to the United
      States as American goods returned. These imports are a health and
      safety risk to American consumers because they may have become
      subpotent or adulterated during foreign handling and shipping.
        "(5) The ready market for prescription drug reimports has been
      the catalyst for a continuing series of frauds against American
      manufacturers and has provided the cover for the importation of
      foreign counterfeit drugs.
        "(6) The existing system of providing drug samples to
      physicians through manufacturer's representatives has been abused
      for decades and has resulted in the sale to consumers of
      misbranded, expired, and adulterated pharmaceuticals.
        "(7) The bulk resale of below wholesale priced prescription
      drugs by health care entities, for ultimate sale at retail, helps
      fuel the diversion market and is an unfair form of competition to
      wholesalers and retailers that must pay otherwise prevailing
      market prices.
        "(8) The effect of these several practices and conditions is to
      create an unacceptable risk that counterfeit, adulterated,
      misbranded, subpotent, or expired drugs will be sold to American
      consumers."

-STATUTE-
    (a) In general
      Sections 351(a)(2)(B), 352(f)(1), and 355 of this title shall not
    apply to a drug product if the drug product is compounded for an
    identified individual patient based on the unsolicited receipt of a
    valid prescription order or a notation, approved by the prescribing
    practitioner, on the prescription order that a compounded product
    is necessary for the identified patient, if the drug product meets
    the requirements of this section, and if the compounding - 
        (1) is by - 
          (A) a licensed pharmacist in a State licensed pharmacy or a
        Federal facility, or
          (B) a licensed physician,

      on the prescription order for such individual patient made by a
      licensed physician or other licensed practitioner authorized by
      State law to prescribe drugs; or
        (2)(A) is by a licensed pharmacist or licensed physician in
      limited quantities before the receipt of a valid prescription
      order for such individual patient; and
        (B) is based on a history of the licensed pharmacist or
      licensed physician receiving valid prescription orders for the
      compounding of the drug product, which orders have been generated
      solely within an established relationship between - 
          (i) the licensed pharmacist or licensed physician; and
          (ii)(I) such individual patient for whom the prescription
        order will be provided; or
          (II) the physician or other licensed practitioner who will
        write such prescription order.
    (b) Compounded drug
      (1) Licensed pharmacist and licensed physician
        A drug product may be compounded under subsection (a) of this
      section if the licensed pharmacist or licensed physician - 
          (A) compounds the drug product using bulk drug substances, as
        defined in regulations of the Secretary published at section
        207.3(a)(4) of title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations - 
            (i) that - 
              (I) comply with the standards of an applicable United
            States Pharmacopoeia or National Formulary monograph, if a
            monograph exists, and the United States Pharmacopoeia
            chapter on pharmacy compounding;
              (II) if such a monograph does not exist, are drug
            substances that are components of drugs approved by the
            Secretary; or
              (III) if such a monograph does not exist and the drug
            substance is not a component of a drug approved by the
            Secretary, that appear on a list developed by the Secretary
            through regulations issued by the Secretary under
            subsection (d) of this section;

            (ii) that are manufactured by an establishment that is
          registered under section 360 of this title (including a
          foreign establishment that is registered under section 360(i)
          of this title); and
            (iii) that are accompanied by valid certificates of
          analysis for each bulk drug substance;

          (B) compounds the drug product using ingredients (other than
        bulk drug substances) that comply with the standards of an
        applicable United States Pharmacopoeia or National Formulary
        monograph, if a monograph exists, and the United States
        Pharmacopoeia chapter on pharmacy compounding;
          (C) does not compound a drug product that appears on a list
        published by the Secretary in the Federal Register of drug
        products that have been withdrawn or removed from the market
        because such drug products or components of such drug products
        have been found to be unsafe or not effective; and
          (D) does not compound regularly or in inordinate amounts (as
        defined by the Secretary) any drug products that are
        essentially copies of a commercially available drug product.
      (2) Definition
        For purposes of paragraph (1)(D), the term "essentially a copy
      of a commercially available drug product" does not include a drug
      product in which there is a change, made for an identified
      individual patient, which produces for that patient a significant
      difference, as determined by the prescribing practitioner,
      between the compounded drug and the comparable commercially
      available drug product.
      (3) Drug product
        A drug product may be compounded under subsection (a) only if -
      
          (A) such drug product is not a drug product identified by the
        Secretary by regulation as a drug product that presents
        demonstrable difficulties for compounding that reasonably
        demonstrate an adverse effect on the safety or effectiveness of
        that drug product; and
          (B) such drug product is compounded in a State - 
            (i) that has entered into a memorandum of understanding
          with the Secretary which addresses the distribution of
          inordinate amounts of compounded drug products interstate and
          provides for appropriate investigation by a State agency of
          complaints relating to compounded drug products distributed
          outside such State; or
            (ii) that has not entered into the memorandum of
          understanding described in clause (i) and the licensed
          pharmacist, licensed pharmacy, or licensed physician
          distributes (or causes to be distributed) compounded drug
          products out of the State in which they are compounded in
          quantities that do not exceed 5 percent of the total
          prescription orders dispensed or distributed by such pharmacy
          or physician.

      The Secretary shall, in consultation with the National
      Association of Boards of Pharmacy, develop a standard memorandum
      of understanding for use by the States in complying with
      subparagraph (B)(i).
    (c) Advertising and promotion
      A drug may be compounded under subsection (a) of this section
    only if the pharmacy, licensed pharmacist, or licensed physician
    does not advertise or promote the compounding of any particular
    drug, class of drug, or type of drug. The pharmacy, licensed
    pharmacist, or licensed physician may advertise and promote the
    compounding service provided by the licensed pharmacist or licensed
    physician.
    (d) Regulations
      (1) In general
        The Secretary shall issue regulations to implement this
      section. Before issuing regulations to implement subsections
      (b)(1)(A)(i)(III), (b)(1)(C), or (b)(3)(A) of this section, the
      Secretary shall convene and consult an advisory committee on
      compounding unless the Secretary determines that the issuance of
      such regulations before consultation is necessary to protect the
      public health. The advisory committee shall include
      representatives from the National Association of Boards of
      Pharmacy, the United States Pharmacopoeia, pharmacy, physician,
      and consumer organizations, and other experts selected by the
      Secretary.
      (2) Limiting compounding
        The Secretary, in consultation with the United States
      Pharmacopoeia Convention, Incorporated, shall promulgate
      regulations identifying drug substances that may be used in
      compounding under subsection (b)(1)(A)(i)(III) of this section
      for which a monograph does not exist or which are not components
      of drug products approved by the Secretary. The Secretary shall
      include in the regulation the criteria for such substances, which
      shall include historical use, reports in peer reviewed medical
      literature, or other criteria the Secretary may identify.
    (e) Application
      This section shall not apply to - 
        (1) compounded positron emission tomography drugs as defined in
      section 321(ii) of this title; or
        (2) radiopharmaceuticals.
    (f) "Compounding" defined

    by the product's manufacturer and other manufacturer directions
    consistent with that labeling.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 354. Veterinary feed directive drugs

-STATUTE-
    (a) Lawful veterinary feed directive requirement
      (1) A drug intended for use in or on animal feed which is limited
    by an approved application filed pursuant to section 360b(b) of
    this title, a conditionally-approved application filed pursuant to
    section 360ccc of this title, or an index listing pursuant to
    section 360ccc-1 of this title to use under the professional
    supervision of a licensed veterinarian is a veterinary feed
    directive drug. Any animal feed bearing or containing a veterinary
    feed directive drug shall be fed to animals only by or upon a
    lawful veterinary feed directive issued by a licensed veterinarian
    in the course of the veterinarian's professional practice. When
    labeled, distributed, held, and used in accordance with this
    section, a veterinary feed directive drug and any animal feed
    bearing or containing a veterinary feed directive drug shall be
    exempt from section 352(f) of this title.
      (2) A veterinary feed directive is lawful if it - 
        (A) contains such information as the Secretary may by general
      regulation or by order require; and
        (B) is in compliance with the conditions and indications for
      use of the drug set forth in the notice published pursuant to
      section 360b(i) of this title, or the index listing pursuant to
      section 360ccc-1(e) of this title.

      (3)(A) Any persons involved in the distribution or use of animal
    feed bearing or containing a veterinary feed directive drug and the
    licensed veterinarian issuing the veterinary feed directive shall
    maintain a copy of the veterinary feed directive applicable to each
    such feed, except in the case of a person distributing such feed to
    another person for further distribution. Such person distributing
    the feed shall maintain a written acknowledgment from the person to
    whom the feed is shipped stating that that person shall not ship or
    move such feed to an animal production facility without a
    veterinary feed directive or ship such feed to another person for
    further distribution unless that person has provided the same
    written acknowledgment to its immediate supplier.
      (B) Every person required under subparagraph (A) to maintain
    records, and every person in charge or custody thereof, shall, upon
    request of an officer or employee designated by the Secretary,
    permit such officer or employee at all reasonable times to have
    access to and copy and verify such records.
      (C) Any person who distributes animal feed bearing or containing
    a veterinary feed directive drug shall upon first engaging in such
    distribution notify the Secretary of that person's name and place
    of business. The failure to provide such notification shall be
    deemed to be an act which results in the drug being misbranded.
    (b) Labeling and advertising
      A veterinary feed directive drug and any feed bearing or
    containing a veterinary feed directive drug shall be deemed to be
    misbranded if their labeling fails to bear such cautionary

    fails to conform to the conditions and indications for use
    published pursuant to section 360b(i) of this title, or the index
    listing pursuant to section 360ccc-1(e) of this title or fails to
    contain the general cautionary statement prescribed by the
    Secretary.

      Neither a drug subject to this section, nor animal feed bearing
    or containing such a drug, shall be deemed to be a prescription

-STATUTE-
    (a) Necessity of effective approval of application
      No person shall introduce or deliver for introduction into
    interstate commerce any new drug, unless an approval of an
    application filed pursuant to subsection (b) or (j) of this section
    is effective with respect to such drug.
    (b) Filing application; contents
      (1) Any person may file with the Secretary an application with
    respect to any drug subject to the provisions of subsection (a) of
    this section. Such person shall submit to the Secretary as a part
    of the application (A) full reports of investigations which have
    been made to show whether or not such drug is safe for use and
    whether such drug is effective in use; (B) a full list of the
    articles used as components of such drug; (C) a full statement of
    the composition of such drug; (D) a full description of the methods
    used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture,
    processing, and packing of such drug; (E) such samples of such drug
    and of the articles used as components thereof as the Secretary may
    require; (F) specimens of the labeling proposed to be used for such
    drug, and (G) any assessments required under section 355c of this
    title. The applicant shall file with the application the patent
    number and the expiration date of any patent which claims the drug
    for which the applicant submitted the application or which claims a
    method of using such drug and with respect to which a claim of
    patent infringement could reasonably be asserted if a person not
    licensed by the owner engaged in the manufacture, use, or sale of
    the drug. If an application is filed under this subsection for a
    drug and a patent which claims such drug or a method of using such
    drug is issued after the filing date but before approval of the
    application, the applicant shall amend the application to include
    the information required by the preceding sentence. Upon approval
    of the application, the Secretary shall publish information
    submitted under the two preceding sentences. The Secretary shall,
    in consultation with the Director of the National Institutes of
    Health and with representatives of the drug manufacturing industry,
    review and develop guidance, as appropriate, on the inclusion of
    women and minorities in clinical trials required by clause (A).
      (2) An application submitted under paragraph (1) for a drug for
    which the investigations described in clause (A) of such paragraph
    and relied upon by the applicant for approval of the application
    were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the
    applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the
    person by or for whom the investigations were conducted shall also
    include - 
        (A) a certification, in the opinion of the applicant and to the
      best of his knowledge, with respect to each patent which claims
      the drug for which such investigations were conducted or which
      claims a use for such drug for which the applicant is seeking
      approval under this subsection and for which information is
      required to be filed under paragraph (1) or subsection (c) of
      this section - 
          (i) that such patent information has not been filed,
          (ii) that such patent has expired,
          (iii) of the date on which such patent will expire, or
          (iv) that such patent is invalid or will not be infringed by
        the manufacture, use, or sale of the new drug for which the
        application is submitted; and

        (B) if with respect to the drug for which investigations
      described in paragraph (1)(A) were conducted information was
      filed under paragraph (1) or subsection (c) of this section for a
      method of use patent which does not claim a use for which the
      applicant is seeking approval under this subsection, a statement
      that the method of use patent does not claim such a use.

      (3) Notice of opinion that patent is invalid or will not be
    infringed. - 
        (A) Agreement to give notice. - An applicant that makes a
      certification described in paragraph (2)(A)(iv) shall include in
      the application a statement that the applicant will give notice
      as required by this paragraph.
        (B) Timing of notice. - An applicant that makes a certification
      described in paragraph (2)(A)(iv) shall give notice as required
      under this paragraph - 
          (i) if the certification is in the application, not later
        than 20 days after the date of the postmark on the notice with
        which the Secretary informs the applicant that the application
        has been filed; or
          (ii) if the certification is in an amendment or supplement to
        the application, at the time at which the applicant submits the
        amendment or supplement, regardless of whether the applicant
        has already given notice with respect to another such
        certification contained in the application or in an amendment
        or supplement to the application.

        (C) Recipients of notice. - An applicant required under this
      paragraph to give notice shall give notice to - 
          (i) each owner of the patent that is the subject of the
        certification (or a representative of the owner designated to
        receive such a notice); and
          (ii) the holder of the approved application under this
        subsection for the drug that is claimed by the patent or a use
        of which is claimed by the patent (or a representative of the
        holder designated to receive such a notice).

        (D) Contents of notice. - A notice required under this
      paragraph shall - 
          (i) state that an application that contains data from
        bioavailability or bioequivalence studies has been submitted
        under this subsection for the drug with respect to which the
        certification is made to obtain approval to engage in the
        commercial manufacture, use, or sale of the drug before the
        expiration of the patent referred to in the certification; and
          (ii) include a detailed statement of the factual and legal
        basis of the opinion of the applicant that the patent is
        invalid or will not be infringed.

      (4)(A) An applicant may not amend or supplement an application
    referred to in paragraph (2) to seek approval of a drug that is a
    different drug than the drug identified in the application as
    submitted to the Secretary.
      (B) With respect to the drug for which such an application is
    submitted, nothing in this subsection or subsection (c)(3) of this
    section prohibits an applicant from amending or supplementing the
    application to seek approval of a different strength.
      (5)(A) The Secretary shall issue guidance for the individuals who
    review applications submitted under paragraph (1) or under section
    262 of title 42, which shall relate to promptness in conducting the
    review, technical excellence, lack of bias and conflict of
    interest, and knowledge of regulatory and scientific standards, and
    which shall apply equally to all individuals who review such
    applications.
      (B) The Secretary shall meet with a sponsor of an investigation
    or an applicant for approval for a drug under this subsection or
    section 262 of title 42 if the sponsor or applicant makes a
    reasonable written request for a meeting for the purpose of
    reaching agreement on the design and size of clinical trials
    intended to form the primary basis of an effectiveness claim. The
    sponsor or applicant shall provide information necessary for
    discussion and agreement on the design and size of the clinical
    trials. Minutes of any such meeting shall be prepared by the
    Secretary and made available to the sponsor or applicant upon
    request.
      (C) Any agreement regarding the parameters of the design and size
    of clinical trials of a new drug under this paragraph that is
    reached between the Secretary and a sponsor or applicant shall be
    reduced to writing and made part of the administrative record by
    the Secretary. Such agreement shall not be changed after the
    testing begins, except - 
        (i) with the written agreement of the sponsor or applicant; or
        (ii) pursuant to a decision, made in accordance with
      subparagraph (D) by the director of the reviewing division, that
      a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the
      safety or effectiveness of the drug has been identified after the
      testing has begun.

      (D) A decision under subparagraph (C)(ii) by the director shall
    be in writing and the Secretary shall provide to the sponsor or
    applicant an opportunity for a meeting at which the director and
    the sponsor or applicant will be present and at which the director
    will document the scientific issue involved.
      (E) The written decisions of the reviewing division shall be
    binding upon, and may not directly or indirectly be changed by, the
    field or compliance division personnel unless such field or
    compliance division personnel demonstrate to the reviewing division
    why such decision should be modified.
      (F) No action by the reviewing division may be delayed because of
    the unavailability of information from or action by field personnel
    unless the reviewing division determines that a delay is necessary
    to assure the marketing of a safe and effective drug.
      (G) For purposes of this paragraph, the reviewing division is the
    division responsible for the review of an application for approval
    of a drug under this subsection or section 262 of title 42
    (including all scientific and medical matters, chemistry,
    manufacturing, and controls).
    (c) Period for approval of application; period for, notice, and
      expedition of hearing; period for issuance of order
      (1) Within one hundred and eighty days after the filing of an
    application under subsection (b) of this section, or such
    additional period as may be agreed upon by the Secretary and the
    applicant, the Secretary shall either - 
        (A) approve the application if he then finds that none of the
      grounds for denying approval specified in subsection (d) of this
      section applies, or
        (B) give the applicant notice of an opportunity for a hearing
      before the Secretary under subsection (d) of this section on the
      question whether such application is approvable. If the applicant
      elects to accept the opportunity for hearing by written request
      within thirty days after such notice, such hearing shall commence
      not more than ninety days after the expiration of such thirty
      days unless the Secretary and the applicant otherwise agree. Any
      such hearing shall thereafter be conducted on an expedited basis
      and the Secretary's order thereon shall be issued within ninety
      days after the date fixed by the Secretary for filing final
      briefs.

      (2) If the patent information described in subsection (b) of this
    section could not be filed with the submission of an application
    under subsection (b) of this section because the application was
    filed before the patent information was required under subsection
    (b) of this section or a patent was issued after the application
    was approved under such subsection, the holder of an approved
    application shall file with the Secretary the patent number and the
    expiration date of any patent which claims the drug for which the
    application was submitted or which claims a method of using such
    drug and with respect to which a claim of patent infringement could
    reasonably be asserted if a person not licensed by the owner
    engaged in the manufacture, use, or sale of the drug. If the holder
    of an approved application could not file patent information under
    subsection (b) of this section because it was not required at the
    time the application was approved, the holder shall file such
    information under this subsection not later than thirty days after
    September 24, 1984, and if the holder of an approved application
    could not file patent information under subsection (b) of this
    section because no patent had been issued when an application was
    filed or approved, the holder shall file such information under
    this subsection not later than thirty days after the date the
    patent involved is issued. Upon the submission of patent
    information under this subsection, the Secretary shall publish it.
      (3) The approval of an application filed under subsection (b) of
    this section which contains a certification required by paragraph
    (2) of such subsection shall be made effective on the last
    applicable date determined by applying the following to each
    certification made under subsection (b)(2)(A) of this section:
        (A) If the applicant only made a certification described in
      clause (i) or (ii) of subsection (b)(2)(A) of this section or in
      both such clauses, the approval may be made effective
      immediately.
        (B) If the applicant made a certification described in clause
      (iii) of subsection (b)(2)(A) of this section, the approval may
      be made effective on the date certified under clause (iii).
        (C) If the applicant made a certification described in clause
      (iv) of subsection (b)(2)(A) of this section, the approval shall
      be made effective immediately unless, before the expiration of 45
      days after the date on which the notice described in subsection
      (b)(3) of this section is received, an action is brought for
      infringement of the patent that is the subject of the
      certification and for which information was submitted to the
      Secretary under paragraph (2) or subsection (b)(1) of this
      section before the date on which the application (excluding an
      amendment or supplement to the application) was submitted. If
      such an action is brought before the expiration of such days, the
      approval may be made effective upon the expiration of the thirty-
      month period beginning on the date of the receipt of the notice
      provided under subsection (b)(3) of this section or such shorter
      or longer period as the court may order because either party to
      the action failed to reasonably cooperate in expediting the
      action, except that - 
          (i) if before the expiration of such period the district
        court decides that the patent is invalid or not infringed
        (including any substantive determination that there is no cause
        of action for patent infringement or invalidity), the approval
        shall be made effective on - 
            (I) the date on which the court enters judgment reflecting
          the decision; or
            (II) the date of a settlement order or consent decree
          signed and entered by the court stating that the patent that
          is the subject of the certification is invalid or not
          infringed;

          (ii) if before the expiration of such period the district
        court decides that the patent has been infringed - 
            (I) if the judgment of the district court is appealed, the
          approval shall be made effective on - 
              (aa) the date on which the court of appeals decides that
            the patent is invalid or not infringed (including any
            substantive determination that there is no cause of action
            for patent infringement or invalidity); or
              (bb) the date of a settlement order or consent decree
            signed and entered by the court of appeals stating that the
            patent that is the subject of the certification is invalid
            or not infringed; or

            (II) if the judgment of the district court is not appealed
          or is affirmed, the approval shall be made effective on the
          date specified by the district court in a court order under
          section 271(e)(4)(A) of title 35;

          (iii) if before the expiration of such period the court
        grants a preliminary injunction prohibiting the applicant from
        engaging in the commercial manufacture or sale of the drug
        until the court decides the issues of patent validity and
        infringement and if the court decides that such patent is
        invalid or not infringed, the approval shall be made effective
        as provided in clause (i); or
          (iv) if before the expiration of such period the court grants
        a preliminary injunction prohibiting the applicant from
        engaging in the commercial manufacture or sale of the drug
        until the court decides the issues of patent validity and
        infringement and if the court decides that such patent has been
        infringed, the approval shall be made effective as provided in
        clause (ii).

      In such an action, each of the parties shall reasonably cooperate
      in expediting the action.
        (D) Civil action to obtain patent certainty. - 
          (i) Declaratory judgment absent infringement action. - 
            (I) In general. - No action may be brought under section
          2201 of title 28 by an applicant referred to in subsection
          (b)(2) of this section for a declaratory judgment with
          respect to a patent which is the subject of the certification
          referred to in subparagraph (C) unless - 
              (aa) the 45-day period referred to in such subparagraph
            has expired;
              (bb) neither the owner of such patent nor the holder of
            the approved application under subsection (b) of this
            section for the drug that is claimed by the patent or a use
            of which is claimed by the patent brought a civil action
            against the applicant for infringement of the patent before
            the expiration of such period; and
              (cc) in any case in which the notice provided under
            paragraph (2)(B) relates to noninfringement, the notice was
            accompanied by a document described in subclause (III).

            (II) Filing of civil action. - If the conditions described
          in items (aa), (bb), and as applicable, (cc) of subclause (I)
          have been met, the applicant referred to in such subclause
          may, in accordance with section 2201 of title 28, bring a
          civil action under such section against the owner or holder
          referred to in such subclause (but not against any owner or
          holder that has brought such a civil action against the
          applicant, unless that civil action was dismissed without
          prejudice) for a declaratory judgment that the patent is
          invalid or will not be infringed by the drug for which the
          applicant seeks approval, except that such civil action may
          be brought for a declaratory judgment that the patent will
          not be infringed only in a case in which the condition
          described in subclause (I)(cc) is applicable. A civil action
          referred to in this subclause shall be brought in the
          judicial district where the defendant has its principal place
          of business or a regular and established place of business.
            (III) Offer of confidential access to application. - For
          purposes of subclause (I)(cc), the document described in this
          subclause is a document providing an offer of confidential
          access to the application that is in the custody of the
          applicant referred to in subsection (b)(2) of this section
          for the purpose of determining whether an action referred to
          in subparagraph (C) should be brought. The document providing
          the offer of confidential access shall contain such
          restrictions as to persons entitled to access, and on the use
          and disposition of any information accessed, as would apply
          had a protective order been entered for the purpose of
          protecting trade secrets and other confidential business
          information. A request for access to an application under an
          offer of confidential access shall be considered acceptance
          of the offer of confidential access with the restrictions as
          to persons entitled to access, and on the use and disposition
          of any information accessed, contained in the offer of
          confidential access, and those restrictions and other terms
          of the offer of confidential access shall be considered terms
          of an enforceable contract. Any person provided an offer of
          confidential access shall review the application for the sole
          and limited purpose of evaluating possible infringement of
          the patent that is the subject of the certification under
          subsection (b)(2)(A)(iv) of this section and for no other
          purpose, and may not disclose information of no relevance to
          any issue of patent infringement to any person other than a
          person provided an offer of confidential access. Further, the
          application may be redacted by the applicant to remove any
          information of no relevance to any issue of patent
          infringement.

          (ii) Counterclaim to infringement action. - 
            (I) In general. - If an owner of the patent or the holder
          of the approved application under subsection (b) of this
          section for the drug that is claimed by the patent or a use
          of which is claimed by the patent brings a patent
          infringement action against the applicant, the applicant may
          assert a counterclaim seeking an order requiring the holder
          to correct or delete the patent information submitted by the
          holder under subsection (b) of this section or this
          subsection on the ground that the patent does not claim
          either - 
              (aa) the drug for which the application was approved; or
              (bb) an approved method of using the drug.

            (II) No independent cause of action. - Subclause (I) does
          not authorize the assertion of a claim described in subclause
          (I) in any civil action or proceeding other than a
          counterclaim described in subclause (I).

          (iii) No damages. - An applicant shall not be entitled to
        damages in a civil action under clause (i) or a counterclaim
        under clause (ii).

        (E)(i) If an application (other than an abbreviated new drug
      application) submitted under subsection (b) of this section for a
      drug, no active ingredient (including any ester or salt of the
      active ingredient) of which has been approved in any other
      application under subsection (b) of this section, was approved
      during the period beginning January 1, 1982, and ending on
      September 24, 1984, the Secretary may not make the approval of
      another application for a drug for which the investigations
      described in clause (A) of subsection (b)(1) of this section and
      relied upon by the applicant for approval of the application were
      not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant
      has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by
      or for whom the investigations were conducted effective before
      the expiration of ten years from the date of the approval of the
      application previously approved under subsection (b) of this
      section.
        (ii) If an application submitted under subsection (b) of this
      section for a drug, no active ingredient (including any ester or
      salt of the active ingredient) of which has been approved in any
      other application under subsection (b) of this section, is
      approved after September 24, 1984, no application which refers to
      the drug for which the subsection (b) application was submitted
      and for which the investigations described in clause (A) of
      subsection (b)(1) of this section and relied upon by the
      applicant for approval of the application were not conducted by
      or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained
      a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the
      investigations were conducted may be submitted under subsection
      (b) of this section before the expiration of five years from the
      date of the approval of the application under subsection (b) of
      this section, except that such an application may be submitted
      under subsection (b) of this section after the expiration of four
      years from the date of the approval of the subsection (b)
      application if it contains a certification of patent invalidity
      or noninfringement described in clause (iv) of subsection
      (b)(2)(A) of this section. The approval of such an application
      shall be made effective in accordance with this paragraph except
      that, if an action for patent infringement is commenced during
      the one-year period beginning forty-eight months after the date
      of the approval of the subsection (b) application, the thirty-
      month period referred to in subparagraph (C) shall be extended
      by such amount of time (if any) which is required for seven and
      one-half years to have elapsed from the date of approval of the
      subsection (b) application.
        (iii) If an application submitted under subsection (b) of this
      section for a drug, which includes an active ingredient
      (including any ester or salt of the active ingredient) that has
      been approved in another application approved under subsection
      (b) of this section, is approved after September 24, 1984, and if
      such application contains reports of new clinical investigations
      (other than bioavailability studies) essential to the approval of
      the application and conducted or sponsored by the applicant, the
      Secretary may not make the approval of an application submitted
      under subsection (b) of this section for the conditions of
      approval of such drug in the approved subsection (b) application
      effective before the expiration of three years from the date of
      the approval of the application under subsection (b) of this
      section if the investigations described in clause (A) of
      subsection (b)(1) of this section and relied upon by the
      applicant for approval of the application were not conducted by
      or for the applicant and if the applicant has not obtained a
      right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the
      investigations were conducted.
        (iv) If a supplement to an application approved under
      subsection (b) of this section is approved after September 24,
      1984, and the supplement contains reports of new clinical
      investigations (other than bioavailabilty (!1) studies) essential
      to the approval of the supplement and conducted or sponsored by
      the person submitting the supplement, the Secretary may not make
      the approval of an application submitted under subsection (b) of
      this section for a change approved in the supplement effective
      before the expiration of three years from the date of the
      approval of the supplement under subsection (b) of this section
      if the investigations described in clause (A) of subsection
      (b)(1) of this section and relied upon by the applicant for
      approval of the application were not conducted by or for the
      applicant and if the applicant has not obtained a right of
      reference or use from the person by or for whom the
      investigations were conducted.

        (v) If an application (or supplement to an application)
      submitted under subsection (b) of this section for a drug, which
      includes an active ingredient (including any ester or salt of the
      active ingredient) that has been approved in another application
      under subsection (b) of this section, was approved during the
      period beginning January 1, 1982, and ending on September 24,
      1984, the Secretary may not make the approval of an application
      submitted under this subsection and for which the investigations
      described in clause (A) of subsection (b)(1) of this section and
      relied upon by the applicant for approval of the application were
      not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant
      has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by
      or for whom the investigations were conducted and which refers to
      the drug for which the subsection (b) application was submitted
      effective before the expiration of two years from September 24,
      1984.

      (4) A drug manufactured in a pilot or other small facility may be
    used to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the drug and to
    obtain approval for the drug prior to manufacture of the drug in a
    larger facility, unless the Secretary makes a determination that a
    full scale production facility is necessary to ensure the safety or
    effectiveness of the drug.
    (d) Grounds for refusing application; approval of application;
      "substantial evidence" defined
      If the Secretary finds, after due notice to the applicant in
    accordance with subsection (c) of this section and giving him an
    opportunity for a hearing, in accordance with said subsection, that
    (1) the investigations, reports of which are required to be
    submitted to the Secretary pursuant to subsection (b) of this
    section, do not include adequate tests by all methods reasonably
    applicable to show whether or not such drug is safe for use under
    the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the
    proposed labeling thereof; (2) the results of such tests show that
    such drug is unsafe for use under such conditions or do not show
    that such drug is safe for use under such conditions; (3) the
    methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the
    manufacture, processing, and packing of such drug are inadequate to
    preserve its identity, strength, quality, and purity; (4) upon the
    basis of the information submitted to him as part of the
    application, or upon the basis of any other information before him
    with respect to such drug, he has insufficient information to
    determine whether such drug is safe for use under such conditions;
    or (5) evaluated on the basis of the information submitted to him
    as part of the application and any other information before him
    with respect to such drug, there is a lack of substantial evidence
    that the drug will have the effect it purports or is represented to
    have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or
    suggested in the proposed labeling thereof; or (6) the application
    failed to contain the patent information prescribed by subsection
    (b) of this section; or (7) based on a fair evaluation of all
    material facts, such labeling is false or misleading in any
    particular; he shall issue an order refusing to approve the
    application. If, after such notice and opportunity for hearing, the
    Secretary finds that clauses (1) through (6) do not apply, he shall
    issue an order approving the application. As used in this
    subsection and subsection (e) of this section, the term
    "substantial evidence" means evidence consisting of adequate and
    well-controlled investigations, including clinical investigations,
    by experts qualified by scientific training and experience to
    evaluate the effectiveness of the drug involved, on the basis of
    which it could fairly and responsibly be concluded by such experts
    that the drug will have the effect it purports or is represented to
    have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or
    suggested in the labeling or proposed labeling thereof. If the
    Secretary determines, based on relevant science, that data from one
    adequate and well-controlled clinical investigation and
    confirmatory evidence (obtained prior to or after such
    investigation) are sufficient to establish effectiveness, the
    Secretary may consider such data and evidence to constitute
    substantial evidence for purposes of the preceding sentence.
    (e) Withdrawal of approval; grounds; immediate suspension upon
      finding imminent hazard to public health
      The Secretary shall, after due notice and opportunity for hearing
    to the applicant, withdraw approval of an application with respect
    to any drug under this section if the Secretary finds (1) that
    clinical or other experience, tests, or other scientific data show
    that such drug is unsafe for use under the conditions of use upon
    the basis of which the application was approved; (2) that new
    evidence of clinical experience, not contained in such application
    or not available to the Secretary until after such application was
    approved, or tests by new methods, or tests by methods not deemed
    reasonably applicable when such application was approved, evaluated
    together with the evidence available to the Secretary when the
    application was approved, shows that such drug is not shown to be
    safe for use under the conditions of use upon the basis of which
    the application was approved; or (3) on the basis of new
    information before him with respect to such drug, evaluated
    together with the evidence available to him when the application
    was approved, that there is a lack of substantial evidence that the
    drug will have the effect it purports or is represented to have
    under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested
    in the labeling thereof; or (4) the patent information prescribed
    by subsection (c) of this section was not filed within thirty days
    after the receipt of written notice from the Secretary specifying
    the failure to file such information; or (5) that the application
    contains any untrue statement of a material fact: Provided, That if
    the Secretary (or in his absence the officer acting as Secretary)
    finds that there is an imminent hazard to the public health, he may
    suspend the approval of such application immediately, and give the
    applicant prompt notice of his action and afford the applicant the
    opportunity for an expedited hearing under this subsection; but the
    authority conferred by this proviso to suspend the approval of an
    application shall not be delegated. The Secretary may also, after
    due notice and opportunity for hearing to the applicant, withdraw
    the approval of an application submitted under subsection (b) or
    (j) of this section with respect to any drug under this section if
    the Secretary finds (1) that the applicant has failed to establish
    a system for maintaining required records, or has repeatedly or
    deliberately failed to maintain such records or to make required
    reports, in accordance with a regulation or order under subsection
    (k) of this section or to comply with the notice requirements of
    section 360(k)(2) of this title, or the applicant has refused to
    permit access to, or copying or verification of, such records as
    required by paragraph (2) of such subsection; or (2) that on the
    basis of new information before him, evaluated together with the
    evidence before him when the application was approved, the methods
    used in, or the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture,
    processing, and packing of such drug are inadequate to assure and
    preserve its identity, strength, quality, and purity and were not
    made adequate within a reasonable time after receipt of written
    notice from the Secretary specifying the matter complained of; or
    (3) that on the basis of new information before him, evaluated
    together with the evidence before him when the application was
    approved, the labeling of such drug, based on a fair evaluation of
    all material facts, is false or misleading in any particular and
    was not corrected within a reasonable time after receipt of written
    notice from the Secretary specifying the matter complained of. Any
    order under this subsection shall state the findings upon which it
    is based.
    (f) Revocation of order refusing, withdrawing or suspending
      approval of application
      Whenever the Secretary finds that the facts so require, he shall
    revoke any previous order under subsection (d) or (e) of this
    section refusing, withdrawing, or suspending approval of an
    application and shall approve such application or reinstate such
    approval, as may be appropriate.
    (g) Service of orders
      Orders of the Secretary issued under this section shall be served
    (1) in person by any officer or employee of the department
    designated by the Secretary or (2) by mailing the order by
    registered mail or by certified mail addressed to the applicant or
    respondent at his last-known address in the records of the
    Secretary.
    (h) Appeal from order
      An appeal may be taken by the applicant from an order of the
    Secretary refusing or withdrawing approval of an application under
    this section. Such appeal shall be taken by filing in the United
    States court of appeals for the circuit wherein such applicant
    resides or has his principal place of business, or in the United
    States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit,
    within sixty days after the entry of such order, a written petition
    praying that the order of the Secretary be set aside. A copy of
    such petition shall be forthwith transmitted by the clerk of the
    court to the Secretary, or any officer designated by him for that
    purpose, and thereupon the Secretary shall certify and file in the
    court the record upon which the order complained of was entered, as
    provided in section 2112 of title 28. Upon the filing of such
    petition such court shall have exclusive jurisdiction to affirm or
    set aside such order, except that until the filing of the record
    the Secretary may modify or set aside his order. No objection to
    the order of the Secretary shall be considered by the court unless
    such objection shall have been urged before the Secretary or unless
    there were reasonable grounds for failure so to do. The finding of
    the Secretary as to the facts, if supported by substantial
    evidence, shall be conclusive. If any person shall apply to the
    court for leave to adduce additional evidence, and shall show to
    the satisfaction of the court that such additional evidence is
    material and that there were reasonable grounds for failure to
    adduce such evidence in the proceeding before the Secretary, the
    court may order such additional evidence to be taken before the
    Secretary and to be adduced upon the hearing in such manner and
    upon such terms and conditions as to the court may seem proper. The
    Secretary may modify his findings as to the facts by reason of the
    additional evidence so taken, and he shall file with the court such
    modified findings which, if supported by substantial evidence,
    shall be conclusive, and his recommendation, if any, for the
    setting aside of the original order. The judgment of the court
    affirming or setting aside any such order of the Secretary shall be
    final, subject to review by the Supreme Court of the United States
    upon certiorari or certification as provided in section 1254 of
    title 28. The commencement of proceedings under this subsection
    shall not, unless specifically ordered by the court to the
    contrary, operate as a stay of the Secretary's order.
    (i) Exemptions of drugs for research; discretionary and mandatory
      conditions; direct reports to Secretary
      (1) The Secretary shall promulgate regulations for exempting from
    the operation of the foregoing subsections of this section drugs
    intended solely for investigational use by experts qualified by
    scientific training and experience to investigate the safety and
    effectiveness of drugs. Such regulations may, within the discretion
    of the Secretary, among other conditions relating to the protection
    of the public health, provide for conditioning such exemption upon -
     
        (A) the submission to the Secretary, before any clinical
      testing of a new drug is undertaken, of reports, by the
      manufacturer or the sponsor of the investigation of such drug, of
      preclinical tests (including tests on animals) of such drug
      adequate to justify the proposed clinical testing;
        (B) the manufacturer or the sponsor of the investigation of a
      new drug proposed to be distributed to investigators for clinical
      testing obtaining a signed agreement from each of such
      investigators that patients to whom the drug is administered will
      be under his personal supervision, or under the supervision of
      investigators responsible to him, and that he will not supply
      such drug to any other investigator, or to clinics, for
      administration to human beings;
        (C) the establishment and maintenance of such records, and the
      making of such reports to the Secretary, by the manufacturer or
      the sponsor of the investigation of such drug, of data (including
      but not limited to analytical reports by investigators) obtained
      as the result of such investigational use of such drug, as the
      Secretary finds will enable him to evaluate the safety and
      effectiveness of such drug in the event of the filing of an
      application pursuant to subsection (b) of this section; and
        (D) the submission to the Secretary by the manufacturer or the
      sponsor of the investigation of a new drug of a statement of
      intent regarding whether the manufacturer or sponsor has plans
      for assessing pediatric safety and efficacy.

      (2) Subject to paragraph (3), a clinical investigation of a new
    drug may begin 30 days after the Secretary has received from the
    manufacturer or sponsor of the investigation a submission
    containing such information about the drug and the clinical
    investigation, including - 
        (A) information on design of the investigation and adequate
      reports of basic information, certified by the applicant to be
      accurate reports, necessary to assess the safety of the drug for
      use in clinical investigation; and
        (B) adequate information on the chemistry and manufacturing of
      the drug, controls available for the drug, and primary data
      tabulations from animal or human studies.

      (3)(A) At any time, the Secretary may prohibit the sponsor of an
    investigation from conducting the investigation (referred to in
    this paragraph as a "clinical hold") if the Secretary makes a
    determination described in subparagraph (B). The Secretary shall
    specify the basis for the clinical hold, including the specific
    information available to the Secretary which served as the basis
    for such clinical hold, and confirm such determination in writing.
      (B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), a determination described
    in this subparagraph with respect to a clinical hold is that - 
        (i) the drug involved represents an unreasonable risk to the
      safety of the persons who are the subjects of the clinical
      investigation, taking into account the qualifications of the
      clinical investigators, information about the drug, the design of
      the clinical investigation, the condition for which the drug is
      to be investigated, and the health status of the subjects
      involved; or
        (ii) the clinical hold should be issued for such other reasons
      as the Secretary may by regulation establish (including reasons
      established by regulation before November 21, 1997).

      (C) Any written request to the Secretary from the sponsor of an
    investigation that a clinical hold be removed shall receive a
    decision, in writing and specifying the reasons therefor, within 30
    days after receipt of such request. Any such request shall include
    sufficient information to support the removal of such clinical
    hold.
      (4) Regulations under paragraph (1) shall provide that such
    exemption shall be conditioned upon the manufacturer, or the
    sponsor of the investigation, requiring that experts using such
    drugs for investigational purposes certify to such manufacturer or
    sponsor that they will inform any human beings to whom such drugs,
    or any controls used in connection therewith, are being
    administered, or their representatives, that such drugs are being
    used for investigational purposes and will obtain the consent of
    such human beings or their representatives, except where it is not
    feasible or it is contrary to the best interests of such human
    beings. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require
    any clinical investigator to submit directly to the Secretary
    reports on the investigational use of drugs.
    (j) Abbreviated new drug applications
      (1) Any person may file with the Secretary an abbreviated
    application for the approval of a new drug.
      (2)(A) An abbreviated application for a new drug shall contain - 
        (i) information to show that the conditions of use prescribed,
      recommended, or suggested in the labeling proposed for the new
      drug have been previously approved for a drug listed under
      paragraph (7) (hereinafter in this subsection referred to as a
      "listed drug");
        (ii)(I) if the listed drug referred to in clause (i) has only
      one active ingredient, information to show that the active
      ingredient of the new drug is the same as that of the listed
      drug;
        (II) if the listed drug referred to in clause (i) has more than
      one active ingredient, information to show that the active
      ingredients of the new drug are the same as those of the listed
      drug, or
        (III) if the listed drug referred to in clause (i) has more
      than one active ingredient and if one of the active ingredients
      of the new drug is different and the application is filed
      pursuant to the approval of a petition filed under subparagraph
      (C), information to show that the other active ingredients of the
      new drug are the same as the active ingredients of the listed
      drug, information to show that the different active ingredient is
      an active ingredient of a listed drug or of a drug which does not
      meet the requirements of section 321(p) of this title, and such
      other information respecting the different active ingredient with
      respect to which the petition was filed as the Secretary may
      require;
        (iii) information to show that the route of administration, the
      dosage form, and the strength of the new drug are the same as
      those of the listed drug referred to in clause (i) or, if the
      route of administration, the dosage form, or the strength of the
      new drug is different and the application is filed pursuant to
      the approval of a petition filed under subparagraph (C), such
      information respecting the route of administration, dosage form,
      or strength with respect to which the petition was filed as the
      Secretary may require;
        (iv) information to show that the new drug is bioequivalent to
      the listed drug referred to in clause (i), except that if the
      application is filed pursuant to the approval of a petition filed
      under subparagraph (C), information to show that the active
      ingredients of the new drug are of the same pharmacological or
      therapeutic class as those of the listed drug referred to in
      clause (i) and the new drug can be expected to have the same
      therapeutic effect as the listed drug when administered to
      patients for a condition of use referred to in clause (i);
        (v) information to show that the labeling proposed for the new
      drug is the same as the labeling approved for the listed drug
      referred to in clause (i) except for changes required because of
      differences approved under a petition filed under subparagraph
      (C) or because the new drug and the listed drug are produced or
      distributed by different manufacturers;
        (vi) the items specified in clauses (B) through (F) of
      subsection (b)(1) of this section;
        (vii) a certification, in the opinion of the applicant and to
      the best of his knowledge, with respect to each patent which
      claims the listed drug referred to in clause (i) or which claims
      a use for such listed drug for which the applicant is seeking
      approval under this subsection and for which information is
      required to be filed under subsection (b) or (c) of this section -
       
          (I) that such patent information has not been filed,
          (II) that such patent has expired,
          (III) of the date on which such patent will expire, or
          (IV) that such patent is invalid or will not be infringed by
        the manufacture, use, or sale of the new drug for which the
        application is submitted; and

        (viii) if with respect to the listed drug referred to in clause
      (i) information was filed under subsection (b) or (c) of this
      section for a method of use patent which does not claim a use for
      which the applicant is seeking approval under this subsection, a
      statement that the method of use patent does not claim such a
      use.

    The Secretary may not require that an abbreviated application

      substantially complete, was submitted. If such an action is
      brought before the expiration of such days, the approval shall be
      made effective upon the expiration of the thirty-month period
      beginning on the date of the receipt of the notice provided under
      paragraph (2)(B)(i) or such shorter or longer period as the court

          (III) if before the expiration of such period the court
        grants a preliminary injunction prohibiting the applicant from

            (bb) First applicant. - As used in this subsection, the
          term "first applicant" means an applicant that, on the first
          day on which a substantially complete application containing
          a certification described in paragraph (2)(A)(vii)(IV) is
          submitted for approval of a drug, submits a substantially
          complete application that contains and lawfully maintains a
          certification described in paragraph (2)(A)(vii)(IV) for the
          drug.
            (cc) Substantially complete application. - As used in this
          subsection, the term "substantially complete application"
          means an application under this subsection that on its face
          is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review and

            listed drug under subparagraph (F) or section 355a of this
            title, or there is a 7-year period of exclusivity for the
            listed drug under section 360cc of this title.
              (BB) Limitation. - A drug that is granted tentative
            approval by the Secretary is not an approved drug and shall
            not have an effective approval until the Secretary issues
            an approval after any necessary additional review of the
            application.

      (C) Civil action to obtain patent certainty. -

        items (aa), (bb), and as applicable, (cc) of subclause (I) have
        been met, the applicant referred to in such subclause may, in
        accordance with section 2201 of title 28, bring a civil action

        such subclause (but not against any owner or holder that has
        brought such a civil action against the applicant, unless that
        civil action was dismissed without prejudice) for a declaratory
        judgment that the patent is invalid or will not be infringed by
        the drug for which the applicant seeks approval, except that
        such civil action may be brought for a declaratory judgment
        that the patent will not be infringed only in a case in which
        the condition described in subclause (I)(cc) is applicable. A
        civil action referred to in this subclause shall be brought in
        the judicial district where the defendant has its principal
        place of business or a regular and established place of
        business.
          (III) Offer of confidential access to application. - For
        purposes of subclause (I)(cc), the document described in this
        subclause is a document providing an offer of confidential
        access to the application that is in the custody of the
        applicant under paragraph (2) for the purpose of determining
        whether an action referred to in subparagraph (B)(iii) should
        be brought. The document providing the offer of confidential
        access shall contain such restrictions as to persons entitled
        to access, and on the use and disposition of any information
        accessed, as would apply had a protective order been entered
        for the purpose of protecting trade secrets and other
        confidential business information. A request for access to an
        application under an offer of confidential access shall be
        considered acceptance of the offer of confidential access with
        the restrictions as to persons entitled to access, and on the
        use and disposition of any information accessed, contained in
        the offer of confidential access, and those restrictions and
        other terms of the offer of confidential access shall be
        considered terms of an enforceable contract. Any person
        provided an offer of confidential access shall review the
        application for the sole and limited purpose of evaluating
        possible infringement of the patent that is the subject of the
        certification under paragraph (2)(A)(vii)(IV) and for no other
        purpose, and may not disclose information of no relevance to
        any issue of patent infringement to any person other than a
        person provided an offer of confidential access. Further, the
        application may be redacted by the applicant to remove any
        information of no relevance to any issue of patent
        infringement.

        (ii) Counterclaim to infringement action. - 
          (I) In general. - If an owner of the patent or the holder of
        the approved application under subsection (b) of this section
        for the drug that is claimed by the patent or a use of which is
        claimed by the patent brings a patent infringement action
        against the applicant, the applicant may assert a counterclaim
        seeking an order requiring the holder to correct or delete the
        patent information submitted by the holder under subsection (b)
        or (c) of this section on the ground that the patent does not
        claim either - 
            (aa) the drug for which the application was approved; or
            (bb) an approved method of using the drug.

          (II) No independent cause of action. - Subclause (I) does not
        authorize the assertion of a claim described in subclause (I)
        in any civil action or proceeding other than a counterclaim
        described in subclause (I).

        (iii) No damages. - An applicant shall not be entitled to
      damages in a civil action under clause (i) or a counterclaim
      under clause (ii).

      (D) Forfeiture of 180-day exclusivity period. - 
        (i) Definition of forfeiture event. - In this subparagraph, the

          (I) Failure to market. - The first applicant fails to market
        the drug by the later of - 
            (aa) the earlier of the date that is - 
              (AA) 75 days after the date on which the approval of the
            application of the first applicant is made effective under
            subparagraph (B)(iii); or
              (BB) 30 months after the date of submission of the
            application of the first applicant; or

            (bb) with respect to the first applicant or any other
          applicant (which other applicant has received tentative
          approval), the date that is 75 days after the date as of
          which, as to each of the patents with respect to which the
          first applicant submitted and lawfully maintained a
          certification qualifying the first applicant for the 180-day
          exclusivity period under subparagraph (B)(iv), at least 1 of
          the following has occurred:
              (AA) In an infringement action brought against that
            applicant with respect to the patent or in a declaratory
            judgment action brought by that applicant with respect to
            the patent, a court enters a final decision from which no
            appeal (other than a petition to the Supreme Court for a
            writ of certiorari) has been or can be taken that the
            patent is invalid or not infringed.
              (BB) In an infringement action or a declaratory judgment
            action described in subitem (AA), a court signs a
            settlement order or consent decree that enters a final
            judgment that includes a finding that the patent is invalid
            or not infringed.
              (CC) The patent information submitted under subsection
            (b) or (c) of this section is withdrawn by the holder of

        applicant fails to obtain tentative approval of the application
        within 30 months after the date on which the application is
        filed, unless the failure is caused by a change in or a review
        of the requirements for approval of the application imposed
        after the date on which the application is filed.
          (V) Agreement with another applicant, the listed drug
        application holder, or a patent owner. - The first applicant
        enters into an agreement with another applicant under this
        subsection for the drug, the holder of the application for the
        listed drug, or an owner of the patent that is the subject of
        the certification under paragraph (2)(A)(vii)(IV), the Federal
        Trade Commission or the Attorney General files a complaint, and
        there is a final decision of the Federal Trade Commission or
        the court with regard to the complaint from which no appeal
        (other than a petition to the Supreme Court for a writ of
        certiorari) has been or can be taken that the agreement has
        violated the antitrust laws (as defined in section 12 of title
        15, except that the term includes section 45 of title 15 to the
        extent that that section applies to unfair methods of
        competition).
          (VI) Expiration of all patents. - All of the patents as to
        which the applicant submitted a certification qualifying it for
        the 180-day exclusivity period have expired.

        (ii) Forfeiture. - The 180-day exclusivity period described in
      subparagraph (B)(iv) shall be forfeited by a first applicant if a
      forfeiture event occurs with respect to that first applicant.
        (iii) Subsequent applicant. - If all first applicants forfeit
      the 180-day exclusivity period under clause (ii) - 
          (I) approval of any application containing a certification
        described in paragraph (2)(A)(vii)(IV) shall be made effective
        in accordance with subparagraph (B)(iii); and
          (II) no applicant shall be eligible for a 180-day exclusivity
        period.

      (E) If the Secretary decides to disapprove an application, the
    Secretary shall give the applicant notice of an opportunity for a
    hearing before the Secretary on the question of whether such
    application is approvable. If the applicant elects to accept the
    opportunity for hearing by written request within thirty days after
    such notice, such hearing shall commence not more than ninety days
    after the expiration of such thirty days unless the Secretary and
    the applicant otherwise agree. Any such hearing shall thereafter be
    conducted on an expedited basis and the Secretary's order thereon
    shall be issued within ninety days after the date fixed by the
    Secretary for filing final briefs.

    section for a drug, no active ingredient (including any ester or
    salt of the active ingredient) of which has been approved in any
    other application under subsection (b) of this section, is approved
    after September 24, 1984, no application may be submitted under
    this subsection which refers to the drug for which the subsection
    (b) application was submitted before the expiration of five years
    from the date of the approval of the application under subsection
    (b) of this section, except that such an application may be
    submitted under this subsection after the expiration of four years
    from the date of the approval of the subsection (b) application if
    it contains a certification of patent invalidity or noninfringement
    described in subclause (IV) of paragraph (2)(A)(vii). The approval
    of such an application shall be made effective in accordance with
    subparagraph (B) except that, if an action for patent infringement
    is commenced during the one-year period beginning forty-eight
    months after the date of the approval of the subsection (b)
    application, the thirty-month period referred to in subparagraph
    (B)(iii) shall be extended by such amount of time (if any) which is
    required for seven and one-half years to have elapsed from the date
    of approval of the subsection (b) application.
      (iii) If an application submitted under subsection (b) of this
    section for a drug, which includes an active ingredient (including
    any ester or salt of the active ingredient) that has been approved
    in another application approved under subsection (b) of this
    section, is approved after September 24, 1984, and if such
    application contains reports of new clinical investigations (other
    than bioavailability studies) essential to the approval of the
    application and conducted or sponsored by the applicant, the
    Secretary may not make the approval of an application submitted
    under this subsection for the conditions of approval of such drug
    in the subsection (b) application effective before the expiration
    of three years from the date of the approval of the application
    under subsection (b) of this section for such drug.
      (iv) If a supplement to an application approved under subsection
    (b) of this section is approved after September 24, 1984, and the

    subsection (b) of this section, was approved during the period
    beginning January 1, 1982, and ending on September 24, 1984, the
    Secretary may not make the approval of an application submitted
    under this subsection which refers to the drug for which the
    subsection (b) application was submitted or which refers to a
    change approved in a supplement to the subsection (b) application
    effective before the expiration of two years from September 24,
    1984.
      (6) If a drug approved under this subsection refers in its
    approved application to a drug the approval of which was withdrawn
    or suspended for grounds described in the first sentence of
    subsection (e) of this section or was withdrawn or suspended under
    this paragraph or which, as determined by the Secretary, has been
    withdrawn from sale for safety or effectiveness reasons, the
    approval of the drug under this subsection shall be withdrawn or
    suspended - 
        (A) for the same period as the withdrawal or suspension under
      subsection (e) of this section or this paragraph, or
        (B) if the listed drug has been withdrawn from sale, for the
      period of withdrawal from sale or, if earlier, the period ending
      on the date the Secretary determines that the withdrawal from
      sale is not for safety or effectiveness reasons.

      (7)(A)(i) Within sixty days of September 24, 1984, the Secretary
    shall publish and make available to the public - 
        (I) a list in alphabetical order of the official and
      proprietary name of each drug which has been approved for safety
      and effectiveness under subsection (c) of this section before
      September 24, 1984;
        (II) the date of approval if the drug is approved after 1981
      and the number of the application which was approved; and
        (III) whether in vitro or in vivo bioequivalence studies, or
      both such studies, are required for applications filed under this
      subsection which will refer to the drug published.

      (ii) Every thirty days after the publication of the first list
    under clause (i) the Secretary shall revise the list to include
    each drug which has been approved for safety and effectiveness
    under subsection (c) of this section or approved under this
    subsection during the thirty-day period.
      (iii) When patent information submitted under subsection (b) or
    (c) of this section respecting a drug included on the list is to be
    published by the Secretary, the Secretary shall, in revisions made
    under clause (ii), include such information for such drug.
      (B) A drug approved for safety and effectiveness under subsection
    (c) of this section or approved under this subsection shall, for
    purposes of this subsection, be considered to have been published
    under subparagraph (A) on the date of its approval or September 24,
    1984, whichever is later.
      (C) If the approval of a drug was withdrawn or suspended for
    grounds described in the first sentence of subsection (e) of this
    section or was withdrawn or suspended under paragraph (6) or if the
    Secretary determines that a drug has been withdrawn from sale for
    safety or effectiveness reasons, it may not be published in the
    list under subparagraph (A) or, if the withdrawal or suspension
    occurred after its publication in such list, it shall be
    immediately removed from such list - 
        (i) for the same period as the withdrawal or suspension under
      subsection (e) of this section or paragraph (6), or
        (ii) if the listed drug has been withdrawn from sale, for the
      period of withdrawal from sale or, if earlier, the period ending
      on the date the Secretary determines that the withdrawal from
      sale is not for safety or effectiveness reasons.

    A notice of the removal shall be published in the Federal Register.
      (8) For purposes of this subsection:
        (A)(i) The term "bioavailability" means the rate and extent to
      which the active ingredient or therapeutic ingredient is absorbed
      from a drug and becomes available at the site of drug action.
        (ii) For a drug that is not intended to be absorbed into the
      bloodstream, the Secretary may assess bioavailability by
      scientifically valid measurements intended to reflect the rate
      and extent to which the active ingredient or therapeutic
      ingredient becomes available at the site of drug action.
        (B) A drug shall be considered to be bioequivalent to a listed
      drug if - 
          (i) the rate and extent of absorption of the drug do not show
        a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption
        of the listed drug when administered at the same molar dose of
        the therapeutic ingredient under similar experimental
        conditions in either a single dose or multiple doses; or
          (ii) the extent of absorption of the drug does not show a
        significant difference from the extent of absorption of the
        listed drug when administered at the same molar dose of the
        therapeutic ingredient under similar experimental conditions in
        either a single dose or multiple doses and the difference from
        the listed drug in the rate of absorption of the drug is
        intentional, is reflected in its proposed labeling, is not
        essential to the attainment of effective body drug
        concentrations on chronic use, and is considered medically
        insignificant for the drug.

        (C) For a drug that is not intended to be absorbed into the
      bloodstream, the Secretary may establish alternative,
      scientifically valid methods to show bioequivalence if the
      alternative methods are expected to detect a significant
      difference between the drug and the listed drug in safety and
      therapeutic effect.

      (9) The Secretary shall, with respect to each application
    submitted under this subsection, maintain a record of - 
        (A) the name of the applicant,
        (B) the name of the drug covered by the application,
        (C) the name of each person to whom the review of the chemistry
      of the application was assigned and the date of such assignment,
      and
        (D) the name of each person to whom the bioequivalence review
      for such application was assigned and the date of such
      assignment.

    The information the Secretary is required to maintain under this
    paragraph with respect to an application submitted under this
    subsection shall be made available to the public after the approval
    of such application.
    (k) Records and reports; required information; regulations and
      orders; access to records
      (1) In the case of any drug for which an approval of an
    application filed under subsection (b) or (j) of this section is in
    effect, the applicant shall establish and maintain such records,
    and make such reports to the Secretary, of data relating to
    clinical experience and other data or information, received or
    otherwise obtained by such applicant with respect to such drug, as
    the Secretary may by general regulation, or by order with respect
    to such application, prescribe on the basis of a finding that such
    records and reports are necessary in order to enable the Secretary
    to determine, or facilitate a determination, whether there is or
    may be ground for invoking subsection (e) of this section.
    Regulations and orders issued under this subsection and under
    subsection (i) of this section shall have due regard for the
    professional ethics of the medical profession and the interests of
    patients and shall provide, where the Secretary deems it to be
    appropriate, for the examination, upon request, by the persons to
    whom such regulations or orders are applicable, of similar
    information received or otherwise obtained by the Secretary.
      (2) Every person required under this section to maintain records,
    and every person in charge or custody thereof, shall, upon request
    of an officer or employee designated by the Secretary, permit such
    officer or employee at all reasonable times to have access to and
    copy and verify such records.
    (l) Public disclosure of safety and effectiveness data
      Safety and effectiveness data and information which has been
    submitted in an application under subsection (b) of this section
    for a drug and which has not previously been disclosed to the
    public shall be made available to the public, upon request, unless
    extraordinary circumstances are shown - 
        (1) if no work is being or will be undertaken to have the
      application approved,
        (2) if the Secretary has determined that the application is not
      approvable and all legal appeals have been exhausted,
        (3) if approval of the application under subsection (c) of this
      section is withdrawn and all legal appeals have been exhausted,
        (4) if the Secretary has determined that such drug is not a new
      drug, or
        (5) upon the effective date of the approval of the first
      application under subsection (j) of this section which refers to
      such drug or upon the date upon which the approval of an
      application under subsection (j) of this section which refers to
      such drug could be made effective if such an application had been
      submitted.
    (m) "Patent" defined
      For purposes of this section, the term "patent" means a patent
    issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office.
    (n) Scientific advisory panels
      (1) For the purpose of providing expert scientific advice and
    recommendations to the Secretary regarding a clinical investigation
    of a drug or the approval for marketing of a drug under this
    section or section 262 of title 42, the Secretary shall establish
    panels of experts or use panels of experts established before
    November 21, 1997, or both.
      (2) The Secretary may delegate the appointment and oversight
    authority granted under section 394 of this title to a director of
    a center or successor entity within the Food and Drug
    Administration.
      (3) The Secretary shall make appointments to each panel
    established under paragraph (1) so that each panel shall consist of
    - 
        (A) members who are qualified by training and experience to
      evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the drugs to be referred
      to the panel and who, to the extent feasible, possess skill and
      experience in the development, manufacture, or utilization of
      such drugs;
        (B) members with diverse expertise in such fields  as  clinical
       and  administrative  medicine, pharmacy, pharmacology,
      pharmacoeconomics, biological and physical sciences, and other
      related professions;
        (C) a representative of consumer interests, and a
      representative of interests of the drug manufacturing industry
      not directly affected by the matter to be brought before the
      panel; and
        (D) two or more members who are specialists or have other
      expertise in the particular disease or condition for which the
      drug under review is proposed to be indicated.

    Scientific, trade, and consumer organizations shall be afforded an
    opportunity to nominate individuals for appointment to the panels.
    No individual who is in the regular full-time employ of the United
    States and engaged in the administration of this chapter may be a
    voting member of any panel. The Secretary shall designate one of
    the members of each panel to serve as chairman thereof.
      (4) Each member of a panel shall publicly disclose all conflicts
    of interest that member may have with the work to be undertaken by
    the panel. No member of a panel may vote on any matter where the
    member or the immediate family of such member could gain
    financially from the advice given to the Secretary. The Secretary
    may grant a waiver of any conflict of interest requirement upon
    public disclosure of such conflict of interest if such waiver is
    necessary to afford the panel essential expertise, except that the
    Secretary may not grant a waiver for a member of a panel when the
    member's own scientific work is involved.
      (5) The Secretary shall, as appropriate, provide education and
    training to each new panel member before such member participates
    in a panel's activities, including education regarding requirements
    under this chapter and related regulations of the Secretary, and
    the administrative processes and procedures related to panel
    meetings.
      (6) Panel members (other than officers or employees of the United
    States), while attending meetings or conferences of a panel or

    homes or regular places of business, panel members may be allowed
    travel expenses (including per diem in lieu of subsistence) as
    authorized by section 5703 of title 5, for persons in the
    Government service employed intermittently.
      (7) The Secretary shall ensure that scientific advisory panels
    meet regularly and at appropriate intervals so that any matter to
    be reviewed by such a panel can be presented to the panel not more
    than 60 days after the matter is ready for such review. Meetings of
    the panel may be held using electronic communication to convene the
    meetings.
      (8) Within 90 days after a scientific advisory panel makes
    recommendations on any matter under its review, the Food and Drug
    Administration official responsible for the matter shall review the
    conclusions and recommendations of the panel, and notify the
    affected persons of the final decision on the matter, or of the
    reasons that no such decision has been reached. Each such final
    decision shall be documented including the rationale for the
    decision.

    (d) Conduct of pediatric studies
      (1) Agreement for studies
        The Secretary may, pursuant to a written request from the
      Secretary under subsection (b) or (c) of this section, after
      consultation with - 
          (A) the sponsor of an application for an investigational new
        drug under section 355(i) of this title;
          (B) the sponsor of an application for a new drug under
        section 355(b)(1) of this title; or
          (C) the holder of an approved application for a drug under
        section 355(b)(1) of this title,

      agree with the sponsor or holder for the conduct of pediatric
      studies for such drug. Such agreement shall be in writing and
      shall include a timeframe for such studies.
      (2) Written protocols to meet the studies requirement
        If the sponsor or holder and the Secretary agree upon written
      protocols for the studies, the studies requirement of subsection
      (b) or (c) of this section is satisfied upon the completion of
      the studies and submission of the reports thereof in accordance
      with the original written request and the written agreement
      referred to in paragraph (1). In reaching an agreement regarding
      written protocols, the Secretary shall take into account adequate
      representation of children of ethnic and racial minorities. Not
      later than 60 days after the submission of the report of the
      studies, the Secretary shall determine if such studies were or
      were not conducted in accordance with the original written
      request and the written agreement and reported in accordance with
      the requirements of the Secretary for filing and so notify the
      sponsor or holder.
      (3) Other methods to meet the studies requirement
        If the sponsor or holder and the Secretary have not agreed in
      writing on the protocols for the studies, the studies requirement
      of subsection (b) or (c) of this section is satisfied when such
      studies have been completed and the reports accepted by the
      Secretary. Not later than 90 days after the submission of the
      reports of the studies, the Secretary shall accept or reject such
      reports and so notify the sponsor or holder. The Secretary's only
      responsibility in accepting or rejecting the reports shall be to
      determine, within the 90 days, whether the studies fairly respond
      to the written request, have been conducted in accordance with
      commonly accepted scientific principles and protocols, and have
      been reported in accordance with the requirements of the
      Secretary for filing.
      (4) Written request to holders of approved applications for drugs
        that have market exclusivity
        (A) Request and response
          If the Secretary makes a written request for pediatric
        studies (including neonates, as appropriate) under subsection
        (c) of this section to the holder of an application approved
        under section 355(b)(1) of this title, the holder, not later
        than 180 days after receiving the written request, shall
        respond to the Secretary as to the intention of the holder to
        act on the request by - 
            (i) indicating when the pediatric studies will be
          initiated, if the holder agrees to the request; or

          request.
        (B) No agreement to request
          (i) Referral
            If the holder does not agree to a written request within
          the time period specified in subparagraph (A), and if the
          Secretary determines that there is a continuing need for
          information relating to the use of the drug in the pediatric
          population (including neonates, as appropriate), the
          Secretary shall refer the drug to the Foundation for the
          National Institutes of Health established under section 290b
          of title 42 (referred to in this paragraph as the
          "Foundation") for the conduct of the pediatric studies
          described in the written request.
          (ii) Public notice
            The Secretary shall give public notice of the name of the
          drug, the name of the manufacturer, and the indications to be
          studied made in a referral under clause (i).
        (C) Lack of funds
          On referral of a drug under subparagraph (B)(i), the
        Foundation shall issue a proposal to award a grant to conduct
        the requested studies unless the Foundation certifies to the
        Secretary, within a timeframe that the Secretary determines is
        appropriate through guidance, that the Foundation does not have
        funds available under section 290b(j)(9)(B)(i) (!1) of title 42
        to conduct the requested studies. If the Foundation so
        certifies, the Secretary shall refer the drug for inclusion on
        the list established under section 284m of title 42 for the
        conduct of the studies.

        (D) Effect of subsection
          Nothing in this subsection (including with respect to
        referrals from the Secretary to the Foundation) alters or
        amends section 331(j) of this title or section 552 of title 5
        or section 1905 of title 18.
        (E) No requirement to refer
          Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require that
        every declined written request shall be referred to the
        Foundation.
        (F) Written requests under subsection (b)
          For drugs under subsection (b) of this section for which
        written requests have not been accepted, if the Secretary
        determines that there is a continuing need for information
        relating to the use of the drug in the pediatric population
        (including neonates, as appropriate), the Secretary shall issue
        a written request under subsection (c) of this section after
        the date of approval of the drug.
    (e) Delay of effective date for certain application
      If the Secretary determines that the acceptance or approval of an
    application under section 355(b)(2) or 355(j) of this title for a
    new drug may occur after submission of reports of pediatric studies
    under this section, which were submitted prior to the expiration of
    the patent (including any patent extension) or the applicable
    period under clauses (ii) through (iv) of section 355(c)(3)(D) of
    this title or clauses (ii) through (iv) of section 355(j)(5)(F) of
    this title, but before the Secretary has determined whether the
    requirements of subsection (d) of this section have been satisfied,
    the Secretary shall delay the acceptance or approval under section
    355(b)(2) or 355(j) of this title until the determination under
    subsection (d) of this section is made, but any such delay shall
    not exceed 90 days. In the event that requirements of this section
    are satisfied, the applicable six-month period under subsection (b)
    or (c) of this section shall be deemed to have been running during
    the period of delay.
    (f) Notice of determinations on studies requirement
      The Secretary shall publish a notice of any determination that
    the requirements of subsection (d) of this section have been met
    and that submissions and approvals under subsection (b)(2) or (j)
    of section 355 of this title for a drug will be subject to the
    provisions of this section.
    (g) Limitations
      A drug to which the six-month period under subsection (b) or (c)
    of this section has already been applied - 
        (1) may receive an additional six-month period under subsection
      (c)(1)(A)(ii) of this section for a supplemental application if
      all other requirements under this section are satisfied, except
      that such a drug may not receive any additional such period under

      (c)(1)(B) of this section.
    (h) Relationship to pediatric research requirements
      Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if any pediatric
    study is required by a provision of law (including a regulation)
    other than this section and such study meets the completeness,
    timeliness, and other requirements of this section, such study
    shall be deemed to satisfy the requirement for market exclusivity
    pursuant to this section.
    (i) Labeling supplements
      (1) Priority status for pediatric supplements
        Any supplement to an application under section 355 of this
      title proposing a labeling change pursuant to a report on a
      pediatric study under this section - 
          (A) shall be considered to be a priority supplement; and
          (B) shall be subject to the performance goals established by
        the Commissioner for priority drugs.
      (2) Dispute resolution
        (A) Request for labeling change and failure to agree
          If the Commissioner determines that an application with
        respect to which a pediatric study is conducted under this
        section is approvable and that the only open issue for final
        action on the application is the reaching of an agreement
        between the sponsor of the application and the Commissioner on
        appropriate changes to the labeling for the drug that is the
        subject of the application, not later than 180 days after the
        date of submission of the application - 
            (i) the Commissioner shall request that the sponsor of the
          application make any labeling change that the Commissioner
          determines to be appropriate; and
            (ii) if the sponsor of the application does not agree to
          make a labeling change requested by the Commissioner, the
          Commissioner shall refer the matter to the Pediatric Advisory
          Committee.
        (B) Action by the Pediatric Advisory Committee
          Not later than 90 days after receiving a referral under
        subparagraph (A)(ii), the Pediatric Advisory Committee shall - 
            (i) review the pediatric study reports; and
            (ii) make a recommendation to the Commissioner concerning
          appropriate labeling changes, if any.
        (C) Consideration of recommendations
          The Commissioner shall consider the recommendations of the
        Pediatric Advisory Committee and, if appropriate, not later
        than 30 days after receiving the recommendation, make a request
        to the sponsor of the application to make any labeling change
        that the Commissioner determines to be appropriate.
        (D) Misbranding
          If the sponsor of the application, within 30 days after
        receiving a request under subparagraph (C), does not agree to
        make a labeling change requested by the Commissioner, the
        Commissioner may deem the drug that is the subject of the
        application to be misbranded.
        (E) No effect on authority
          Nothing in this subsection limits the authority of the United
        States to bring an enforcement action under this chapter when a
        drug lacks appropriate pediatric labeling. Neither course of
        action (the Pediatric Advisory Committee process or an
        enforcement action referred to in the preceding sentence) shall
        preclude, delay, or serve as the basis to stay the other course
        of action.
    (j) Dissemination of pediatric information
      (1) In general
        Not later than 180 days after the date of submission of a
      report on a pediatric study under this section, the Commissioner
      shall make available to the public a summary of the medical and
      clinical pharmacology reviews of pediatric studies conducted for
      the supplement, including by publication in the Federal Register.
      (2) Effect of subsection
        Nothing in this subsection alters or amends section 331(j) of
      this title or section 552 of title 5 or section 1905 of title 18.
    (k) Clarification of interaction of market exclusivity under this
      section and market exclusivity awarded to an applicant for
      approval of a drug under section 355(j) of this title
      If a 180-day period under section 355(j)(5)(B)(iv) of this title
    overlaps with a 6-month exclusivity period under this section, so
    that the applicant for approval of a drug under section 355(j) of
    this title entitled to the 180-day period under that section loses
    a portion of the 180-day period to which the applicant is entitled
    for the drug, the 180-day period shall be extended from - 
        (1) the date on which the 180-day period would have expired by
      the number of days of the overlap, if the 180-day period would,
      but for the application of this subsection, expire after the 6-
      month exclusivity period; or
        (2) the date on which the 6-month exclusivity period expires,
      by the number of days of the overlap if the 180-day period would,
      but for the application of this subsection, expire during the six-
      month exclusivity period.
    (l) Prompt approval of drugs under section 355(j) of this title
      when pediatric information is added to labeling
      (1) General rule
        A drug for which an application has been submitted or approved
      under section 355(j) of this title shall not be considered
      ineligible for approval under that section or misbranded under
      section 352 of this title on the basis that the labeling of the
      drug omits a pediatric indication or any other aspect of labeling
      pertaining to pediatric use when the omitted indication or other
      aspect is protected by patent or by exclusivity under clause
      (iii) or (iv) of section 355(j)(5)(F) of this title.
      (2) Labeling
        Notwithstanding clauses (iii) and (iv) of section 355(j)(5)(F)
      of this title, the Secretary may require that the labeling of a
      drug approved under section 355(j) of this title that omits a
      pediatric indication or other aspect of labeling as described in
      paragraph (1) include - 
          (A) a statement that, because of marketing exclusivity for a
        manufacturer - 
            (i) the drug is not labeled for pediatric use; or
            (ii) in the case of a drug for which there is an additional
          pediatric use not referred to in paragraph (1), the drug is
          not labeled for the pediatric use under paragraph (1); and

          (B) a statement of any appropriate pediatric
        contraindications, warnings, or precautions that the Secretary
        considers necessary.
      (3) Preservation of pediatric exclusivity and other provisions
        This subsection does not affect - 
          (A) the availability or scope of exclusivity under this
        section;
          (B) the availability or scope of exclusivity under section
        355 of this title for pediatric formulations;
          (C) the question of the eligibility for approval of any
        application under section 355(j) of this title that omits any
        other conditions of approval entitled to exclusivity under
        clause (iii) or (iv) of section 355(j)(5)(F) of this title; or
          (D) except as expressly provided in paragraphs (1) and (2),
        the operation of section 355 of this title.
    (m) Report
      The Secretary shall conduct a study and report to Congress not
    later than January 1, 2001, based on the experience under the
    program established under this section. The study and report shall
    examine all relevant issues, including - 
        (1) the effectiveness of the program in improving information
      about important pediatric uses for approved drugs;
        (2) the adequacy of the incentive provided under this section;
        (3) the economic impact of the program on taxpayers and
      consumers, including the impact of the lack of lower cost generic
      drugs on patients, including on lower income patients; and
        (4) any suggestions for modification that the Secretary
      determines to be appropriate.
    (n) Sunset
      A drug may not receive any 6-month period under subsection (b) or
    (c) of this section unless - 
        (1) on or before October 1, 2007, the Secretary makes a written
      request for pediatric studies of the drug;
        (2) on or before October 1, 2007, an application for the drug
      is accepted for filing under section 355(b) of this title; and
        (3) all requirements of this section are met.

        of drugs tested and granted exclusivity under the Federal Food,
        Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.), and loss of
        revenue by the generic drug industry and retail pharmacies as a

-STATUTE-
    (a) Toll-free number in labeling
      Not later than one year after January 4, 2002, the Secretary of
    Health and Human Services shall promulgate a final rule requiring
    that the labeling of each drug for which an application is approved
    under section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [21
    U.S.C. 355] (regardless of the date on which approved) include the
    toll-free number maintained by the Secretary for the purpose of
    receiving reports of adverse events regarding drugs and a statement
    that such number is to be used for reporting purposes only, not to
    receive medical advice. With respect to the final rule:
        (1) The rule shall provide for the implementation of such
      labeling requirement in a manner that the Secretary considers to
      be most likely to reach the broadest consumer audience.
        (2) In promulgating the rule, the Secretary shall seek to
      minimize the cost of the rule on the pharmacy profession.
        (3) The rule shall take effect not later than 60 days after the
      date on which the rule is promulgated.
    (b) Drugs with pediatric market exclusivity
      (1) In general
        During the one year beginning on the date on which a drug
      receives a period of market exclusivity under 505A (!1) of the
      Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [21 U.S.C. 355a], any report
      of an adverse event regarding the drug that the Secretary of
      Health and Human Services receives shall be referred to the
      Office of Pediatric Therapeutics established under section 393a
      of this title. In considering the report, the Director of such
      Office shall provide for the review of the report by the
      Pediatric Advisory Committee, including obtaining any
      recommendations of such subcommittee (!2) regarding whether the
      Secretary should take action under the Federal Food, Drug, and
      Cosmetic Act [21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.] in response to the report.


      (2) Rule of construction
        Paragraph (1) may not be construed as restricting the authority
      of the Secretary of Health and Human Services to continue
      carrying out the activities described in such paragraph regarding
      a drug after the one-year period described in such paragraph
      regarding the drug has expired.

    Sec. 355c. Research into pediatric uses for drugs and biological
      products

-STATUTE-
    (a) New drugs and biological products
      (1) In general
        A person that submits an application (or supplement to an
      application) - 
          (A) under section 355 of this title for a new active
        ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing
        regimen, or new route of administration; or
          (B) under section 262 of title 42 for a new active
        ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing
        regimen, or new route of administration;

      shall submit with the application the assessments described in
      paragraph (2).
      (2) Assessments
        (A) In general
          The assessments referred to in paragraph (1) shall contain
        data, gathered using appropriate formulations for each age
        group for which the assessment is required, that are adequate -
        
            (i) to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug or
          the biological product for the claimed indications in all
          relevant pediatric subpopulations; and
            (ii) to support dosing and administration for each
          pediatric subpopulation for which the drug or the biological
          product is safe and effective.
        (B) Similar course of disease or similar effect of drug or
          biological product
          (i) In general
            If the course of the disease and the effects of the drug
          are sufficiently similar in adults and pediatric patients,
          the Secretary may conclude that pediatric effectiveness can
          be extrapolated from adequate and well-controlled studies in
          adults, usually supplemented with other information obtained
          in pediatric patients, such as pharmacokinetic studies.
          (ii) Extrapolation between age groups
            A study may not be needed in each pediatric age group if
          data from one age group can be extrapolated to another age
          group.
      (3) Deferral
        On the initiative of the Secretary or at the request of the
      applicant, the Secretary may defer submission of some or all
      assessments required under paragraph (1) until a specified date
      after approval of the drug or issuance of the license for a
      biological product if - 
          (A) the Secretary finds that - 
            (i) the drug or biological product is ready for approval
          for use in adults before pediatric studies are complete;
            (ii) pediatric studies should be delayed until additional
          safety or effectiveness data have been collected; or
            (iii) there is another appropriate reason for deferral; and

          (B) the applicant submits to the Secretary - 
            (i) certification of the grounds for deferring the
          assessments;
            (ii) a description of the planned or ongoing studies; and
            (iii) evidence that the studies are being conducted or will
          be conducted with due diligence and at the earliest possible
          time.
      (4) Waivers
        (A) Full waiver
          On the initiative of the Secretary or at the request of an
        applicant, the Secretary shall grant a full waiver, as
        appropriate, of the requirement to submit assessments for a
        drug or biological product under this subsection if the
        applicant certifies and the Secretary finds that - 
            (i) necessary studies are impossible or highly
          impracticable (because, for example, the number of patients
          is so small or the patients are geographically dispersed);
            (ii) there is evidence strongly suggesting that the drug or
          biological product would be ineffective or unsafe in all
          pediatric age groups; or
            (iii) the drug or biological product - 
              (I) does not represent a meaningful therapeutic benefit
            over existing therapies for pediatric patients; and
              (II) is not likely to be used in a substantial number of
            pediatric patients.
        (B) Partial waiver
          On the initiative of the Secretary or at the request of an
        applicant, the Secretary shall grant a partial waiver, as
        appropriate, of the requirement to submit assessments for a
        drug or biological product under this subsection with respect
        to a specific pediatric age group if the applicant certifies
        and the Secretary finds that - 
            (i) necessary studies are impossible or highly
          impracticable (because, for example, the number of patients
          in that age group is so small or patients in that age group
          are geographically dispersed);
            (ii) there is evidence strongly suggesting that the drug or
          biological product would be ineffective or unsafe in that age
          group;
            (iii) the drug or biological product - 
              (I) does not represent a meaningful therapeutic benefit
            over existing therapies for pediatric patients in that age
            group; and
              (II) is not likely to be used by a substantial number of
            pediatric patients in that age group; or

            (iv) the applicant can demonstrate that reasonable attempts
          to produce a pediatric formulation necessary for that age
          group have failed.
        (C) Pediatric formulation not possible
          If a waiver is granted on the ground that it is not possible
        to develop a pediatric formulation, the waiver shall cover only
        the pediatric groups requiring that formulation.
        (D) Labeling requirement
          If the Secretary grants a full or partial waiver because
        there is evidence that a drug or biological product would be
        ineffective or unsafe in pediatric populations, the information
        shall be included in the labeling for the drug or biological
        product.
    (b) Marketed drugs and biological products
      (1) In general
        After providing notice in the form of a letter and an
      opportunity for written response and a meeting, which may include
      an advisory committee meeting, the Secretary may (by order in the
      form of a letter) require the holder of an approved application
      for a drug under section 355 of this title or the holder of a
      license for a biological product under section 262 of title 42 to
      submit by a specified date the assessments described in
      subsection (a)(2) of this section if the Secretary finds that - 
          (A)(i) the drug or biological product is used for a
        substantial number of pediatric patients for the labeled
        indications; and
          (ii) the absence of adequate labeling could pose significant
        risks to pediatric patients; or
          (B)(i) there is reason to believe that the drug or biological
        product would represent a meaningful therapeutic benefit over
        existing therapies for pediatric patients for one or more of
        the claimed indications; and
          (ii) the absence of adequate labeling could pose significant
        risks to pediatric patients.
      (2) Waivers
        (A) Full waiver
          At the request of an applicant, the Secretary shall grant a
        full waiver, as appropriate, of the requirement to submit
        assessments under this subsection if the applicant certifies
        and the Secretary finds that - 
            (i) necessary studies are impossible or highly
          impracticable (because, for example, the number of patients
          in that age group is so small or patients in that age group
          are geographically dispersed); or
            (ii) there is evidence strongly suggesting that the drug or
          biological product would be ineffective or unsafe in all
          pediatric age groups.
        (B) Partial waiver
          At the request of an applicant, the Secretary shall grant a
        partial waiver, as appropriate, of the requirement to submit
        assessments under this subsection with respect to a specific
        pediatric age group if the applicant certifies and the
        Secretary finds that - 
            (i) necessary studies are impossible or highly
          impracticable (because, for example, the number of patients
          in that age group is so small or patients in that age group
          are geographically dispersed);
            (ii) there is evidence strongly suggesting that the drug or
          biological product would be ineffective or unsafe in that age
          group;
            (iii)(I) the drug or biological product - 
              (aa) does not represent a meaningful therapeutic benefit
            over existing therapies for pediatric patients in that age
            group; and
              (bb) is not likely to be used in a substantial number of
            pediatric patients in that age group; and

            (II) the absence of adequate labeling could not pose
          significant risks to pediatric patients; or
            (iv) the applicant can demonstrate that reasonable attempts
          to produce a pediatric formulation necessary for that age
          group have failed.
        (C) Pediatric formulation not possible
          If a waiver is granted on the ground that it is not possible
        to develop a pediatric formulation, the waiver shall cover only
        the pediatric groups requiring that formulation.
        (D) Labeling requirement
          If the Secretary grants a full or partial waiver because
        there is evidence that a drug or biological product would be
        ineffective or unsafe in pediatric populations, the information
        shall be included in the labeling for the drug or biological
        product.
      (3) Relationship to other pediatric provisions
        (A) No assessment without written request
          No assessment may be required under paragraph (1) for a drug
        subject to an approved application under section 355 of this
        title unless - 
            (i) the Secretary has issued a written request for a
          related pediatric study under section 355a(c) of this title
          or section 284m of title 42;
            (ii)(I) if the request was made under section 355a(c) of
          this title - 
              (aa) the recipient of the written request does not agree
            to the request; or
              (bb) the Secretary does not receive a response as
            specified under section 355a(d)(4)(A) of this title; or

            (II) if the request was made under section 284m of title 42
          - 
              (aa) the recipient of the written request does not agree
            to the request; or
              (bb) the Secretary does not receive a response as
            specified under section 284m(c)(2) of title 42; and

            (iii)(I) the Secretary certifies under subparagraph (B)
          that there are insufficient funds under sections 284m and
          290b of title 42 to conduct the study; or
            (II) the Secretary publishes in the Federal Register a
          certification that certifies that - 
              (aa) no contract or grant has been awarded under section
            284m or 290b of title 42; and
              (bb) not less than 270 days have passed since the date of
            a certification under subparagraph (B) that there are
            sufficient funds to conduct the study.
        (B) No agreement to request
          Not later than 60 days after determining that no holder will
        agree to the written request (including a determination that
        the Secretary has not received a response specified under
        section 355a(d) of this title or section 284m of title 42,(!1)
        the Secretary shall certify whether the Secretary has
        sufficient funds to conduct the study under section 284m or
        290b of title 42, taking into account the prioritization under
        section 284m of title 42.

    (c) Meaningful therapeutic benefit
      For the purposes of paragraph (4)(A)(iii)(I) and (4)(B)(iii)(I)
    of subsection (a) of this section and paragraphs (1)(B)(i) and
    (2)(B)(iii)(I)(aa) of subsection (b) of this section, a drug or
    biological product shall be considered to represent a meaningful
    therapeutic benefit over existing therapies if the Secretary
    estimates that - 
        (1) if approved, the drug or biological product would represent
      a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis, or
      prevention of a disease, compared with marketed products
      adequately labeled for that use in the relevant pediatric
      population; or
        (2) the drug or biological product is in a class of products or
      for an indication for which there is a need for additional
      options.
    (d) Submission of assessments
      If a person fails to submit an assessment described in subsection
    (a)(2) of this section, or a request for approval of a pediatric
    formulation described in subsection (a) or (b) of this section, in
    accordance with applicable provisions of subsections (a) and (b) of
    this section - 
        (1) the drug or biological product that is the subject of the
      assessment or request may be considered misbranded solely because
      of that failure and subject to relevant enforcement action
      (except that the drug or biological product shall not be subject
      to action under section 333 of this title); but
        (2) the failure to submit the assessment or request shall not
      be the basis for a proceeding - 
          (A) to withdraw approval for a drug under section 355(e) of
        this title; or
          (B) to revoke the license for a biological product under
        section 262 of title 42.
    (e) Meetings
      Before and during the investigational process for a new drug or
    biological product, the Secretary shall meet at appropriate times
    with the sponsor of the new drug or biological product to discuss -
    
        (1) information that the sponsor submits on plans and timelines
      for pediatric studies; or
        (2) any planned request by the sponsor for waiver or deferral
      of pediatric studies.
    (f) Scope of authority
      Nothing in this section provides to the Secretary any authority

    Sec. 356. Fast track products

-STATUTE-
    (a) Designation of drug as fast track product
      (1) In general
        The Secretary shall, at the request of the sponsor of a new
      drug, facilitate the development and expedite the review of such
      drug if it is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-
      threatening condition and it demonstrates the potential to
      address unmet medical needs for such a condition. (In this
      section, such a drug is referred to as a "fast track product".)
      (2) Request for designation
        The sponsor of a new drug may request the Secretary to
      designate the drug as a fast track product. A request for the
      designation may be made concurrently with, or at any time after,
      submission of an application for the investigation of the drug
      under section 355(i) of this title or section 262(a)(3) of title
      42.
      (3) Designation
        Within 60 calendar days after the receipt of a request under
      paragraph (2), the Secretary shall determine whether the drug
      that is the subject of the request meets the criteria described
      in paragraph (1). If the Secretary finds that the drug meets the
      criteria, the Secretary shall designate the drug as a fast track
      product and shall take such actions as are appropriate to
      expedite the development and review of the application for
      approval of such product.
    (b) Approval of application for fast track product
      (1) In general
        The Secretary may approve an application for approval of a fast
      track product under section 355(c) of this title or section 262
      of title 42 upon a determination that the product has an effect
      on a clinical endpoint or on a surrogate endpoint that is
      reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit.
      (2) Limitation
        Approval of a fast track product under this subsection may be
      subject to the requirements - 
          (A) that the sponsor conduct appropriate post-approval
        studies to validate the surrogate endpoint or otherwise confirm
        the effect on the clinical endpoint; and
          (B) that the sponsor submit copies of all promotional
        materials related to the fast track product during the
        preapproval review period and, following approval and for such
        period thereafter as the Secretary determines to be
        appropriate, at least 30 days prior to dissemination of the
        materials.
      (3) Expedited withdrawal of approval
        The Secretary may withdraw approval of a fast track product
      using expedited procedures (as prescribed by the Secretary in
      regulations which shall include an opportunity for an informal
      hearing) if - 
          (A) the sponsor fails to conduct any required post-approval
        study of the fast track drug with due diligence;
          (B) a post-approval study of the fast track product fails to
        verify clinical benefit of the product;
          (C) other evidence demonstrates that the fast track product
        is not safe or effective under the conditions of use; or
          (D) the sponsor disseminates false or misleading promotional
        materials with respect to the product.
    (c) Review of incomplete applications for approval of fast track
      product
      (1) In general
        If the Secretary determines, after preliminary evaluation of
      clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a fast track product
      may be effective, the Secretary shall evaluate for filing, and
      may commence review of portions of, an application for the
      approval of the product before the sponsor submits a complete
      application. The Secretary shall commence such review only if the
      applicant - 
          (A) provides a schedule for submission of information
        necessary to make the application complete; and
          (B) pays any fee that may be required under section 379h of
        this title.
      (2) Exception
        Any time period for review of human drug applications that has
      been agreed to by the Secretary and that has been set forth in
      goals identified in letters of the Secretary (relating to the use
      of fees collected under section 379h of this title to expedite
      the drug development process and the review of human drug
      applications) shall not apply to an application submitted under
      paragraph (1) until the date on which the application is
      complete.
    (d) Awareness efforts
      The Secretary shall - 
        (1) develop and disseminate to physicians, patient
      organizations, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and
      other appropriate persons a description of the provisions of this
      section applicable to fast track products; and
        (2) establish a program to encourage the development of
      surrogate endpoints that are reasonably likely to predict
      clinical benefit for serious or life-threatening conditions for
      which there exist significant unmet medical needs.

    Sec. 356a. Manufacturing changes

-STATUTE-
    (a) In general
      With respect to a drug for which there is in effect an approved
    application under section 355 or 360b of this title or a license
    under section 262 of title 42, a change from the manufacturing
    process approved pursuant to such application or license may be
    made, and the drug as made with the change may be distributed, if -
    
        (1) the holder of the approved application or license (referred
      to in this section as a "holder") has validated the effects of
      the change in accordance with subsection (b) of this section; and
        (2)(A) in the case of a major manufacturing change, the holder
      has complied with the requirements of subsection (c) of this
      section; or
        (B) in the case of a change that is not a major manufacturing
      change, the holder complies with the applicable requirements of
      subsection (d) of this section.
    (b) Validation of effects of changes
      For purposes of subsection (a)(1) of this section, a drug made
    with a manufacturing change (whether a major manufacturing change
    or otherwise) may be distributed only if, before distribution of
    the drug as so made, the holder involved validates the effects of
    the change on the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency
    of the drug as the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency
    may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the drug.
    (c) Major manufacturing changes
      (1) Requirement of supplemental application
        For purposes of subsection (a)(2)(A) of this section, a drug
      made with a major manufacturing change may be distributed only
      if, before the distribution of the drug as so made, the holder
      involved submits to the Secretary a supplemental application for
      such change and the Secretary approves the application. The
      application shall contain such information as the Secretary
      determines to be appropriate, and shall include the information
      developed under subsection (b) of this section by the holder in
      validating the effects of the change.
      (2) Changes qualifying as major changes
        For purposes of subsection (a)(2)(A) of this section, a major
      manufacturing change is a manufacturing change that is determined
      by the Secretary to have substantial potential to adversely
      affect the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of the
      drug as they may relate to the safety or effectiveness of a drug.
      Such a change includes a change that - 
          (A) is made in the qualitative or quantitative formulation of
        the drug involved or in the specifications in the approved
        application or license referred to in subsection (a) of this
        section for the drug (unless exempted by the Secretary by
        regulation or guidance from the requirements of this
        subsection);
          (B) is determined by the Secretary by regulation or guidance
        to require completion of an appropriate clinical study
        demonstrating equivalence of the drug to the drug as
        manufactured without the change; or
          (C) is another type of change determined by the Secretary by
        regulation or guidance to have a substantial potential to
        adversely affect the safety or effectiveness of the drug.
    (d) Other manufacturing changes
      (1) In general
        For purposes of subsection (a)(2)(B) of this section, the
      Secretary may regulate drugs made with manufacturing changes that
      are not major manufacturing changes as follows:
          (A) The Secretary may in accordance with paragraph (2)
        authorize holders to distribute such drugs without submitting a
        supplemental application for such changes.
          (B) The Secretary may in accordance with paragraph (3)
        require that, prior to the distribution of such drugs, holders
        submit to the Secretary supplemental applications for such
        changes.
          (C) The Secretary may establish categories of such changes
        and designate categories to which subparagraph (A) applies and
        categories to which subparagraph (B) applies.
      (2) Changes not requiring supplemental application
        (A) Submission of report
          A holder making a manufacturing change to which paragraph
        (1)(A) applies shall submit to the Secretary a report on the
        change, which shall contain such information as the Secretary
        determines to be appropriate, and which shall include the
        information developed under subsection (b) of this section by
        the holder in validating the effects of the change. The report
        shall be submitted by such date as the Secretary may specify.
        (B) Authority regarding annual reports
          In the case of a holder that during a single year makes more
        than one manufacturing change to which paragraph (1)(A)
        applies, the Secretary may in carrying out subparagraph (A)
        authorize the holder to comply with such subparagraph by
        submitting a single report for the year that provides the
        information required in such subparagraph for all the changes
        made by the holder during the year.
      (3) Changes requiring supplemental application
        (A) Submission of supplemental application
          The supplemental application required under paragraph (1)(B)
        for a manufacturing change shall contain such information as
        the Secretary determines to be appropriate, which shall include
        the information developed under subsection (b) of this section
        by the holder in validating the effects of the change.
        (B) Authority for distribution
          In the case of a manufacturing change to which paragraph
        (1)(B) applies:
            (i) The holder involved may commence distribution of the
          drug involved 30 days after the Secretary receives the
          supplemental application under such paragraph, unless the
          Secretary notifies the holder within such 30-day period that
          prior approval of the application is required before
          distribution may be commenced.
            (ii) The Secretary may designate a category of such changes
          for the purpose of providing that, in the case of a change
          that is in such category, the holder involved may commence
          distribution of the drug involved upon the receipt by the
          Secretary of a supplemental application for the change.

    Sec. 356b. Reports of postmarketing studies

-STATUTE-
    (a) Submission
      (1) In general
        A sponsor of a drug that has entered into an agreement with the
      Secretary to conduct a postmarketing study of a drug shall submit
      to the Secretary, within 1 year after the approval of such drug
      and annually thereafter until the study is completed or
      terminated, a report of the progress of the study or the reasons
      for the failure of the sponsor to conduct the study. The report
      shall be submitted in such form as is prescribed by the Secretary
      in regulations issued by the Secretary.
      (2) Agreements prior to effective date
        Any agreement entered into between the Secretary and a sponsor
      of a drug, prior to November 21, 1997, to conduct a postmarketing
      study of a drug shall be subject to the requirements of paragraph
      (1). An initial report for such an agreement shall be submitted
      within 6 months after the date of the issuance of the regulations
      under paragraph (1).
    (b) Consideration of information as public information
      Any information pertaining to a report described in subsection
    (a) of this section shall be considered to be public information to
    the extent that the information is necessary - 
        (1) to identify the sponsor; and
        (2) to establish the status of a study described in subsection
      (a) of this section and the reasons, if any, for any failure to
      carry out the study.
    (c) Status of studies and reports
      The Secretary shall annually develop and publish in the Federal
    Register a report that provides information on the status of the
    postmarketing studies - 
        (1) that sponsors have entered into agreements to conduct; and
        (2) for which reports have been submitted under subsection
      (a)(1) of this section.
    (d) Disclosure
      If a sponsor fails to complete an agreed upon study required by
    this section by its original or otherwise negotiated deadline, the
    Secretary shall publish a statement on the Internet site of the
    Food and Drug Administration stating that the study was not
    completed and, if the reasons for such failure to complete the
    study were not satisfactory to the Secretary, a statement that such
    reasons were not satisfactory to the Secretary.
    (e) Notification
      With respect to studies of the type required under section
    356(b)(2)(A) of this title or under section 314.510 or 601.41 of
    title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, as each of such sections was
    in effect on the day before the effective date of this subsection,
    the Secretary may require that a sponsor who, for reasons not
    satisfactory to the Secretary, fails to complete by its deadline a
    study under any of such sections of such type for a drug or
    biological product (including such a study conducted after such
    effective date) notify practitioners who prescribe such drug or
    biological product of the failure to complete such study and the
    questions of clinical benefit, and, where appropriate, questions of
    safety, that remain unanswered as a result of the failure to
    complete such study. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed
    as altering the requirements of the types of studies required under
    section 356(b)(2)(A) of this title or under section 314.510 or
    601.41 of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, as so in effect,
    or as prohibiting the Secretary from modifying such sections of
    title 21 of such Code to provide for studies in addition to those
    of such type.

-STATUTE-
    (a) In general
      A manufacturer that is the sole manufacturer of a drug - 
        (1) that is - 
          (A) life-supporting;
          (B) life-sustaining; or
          (C) intended for use in the prevention of a debilitating
        disease or condition;

        (2) for which an application has been approved under section

    discontinuance.
    (b) Reduction in notification period
      The notification period required under subsection (a) of this
    section for a manufacturer may be reduced if the manufacturer
    certifies to the Secretary that good cause exists for the

      manufacturing for the 6-month period;
        (2) a biomaterials shortage prevents the continuation of the
      manufacturing for the 6-month period;
        (3) a liability problem may exist for the manufacturer if the
      manufacturing is continued for the 6-month period;
        (4) continuation of the manufacturing for the 6-month period
      may cause substantial economic hardship for the manufacturer;
        (5) the manufacturer has filed for bankruptcy under chapter 7

    Sec. 358. Authority to designate official names

-STATUTE-
    (a) Necessity or desirability; use in official compendiums;
      infringement of trademarks
      The Secretary may designate an official name for any drug or
    device if he determines that such action is necessary or desirable
    in the interest of usefulness and simplicity. Any official name
    designated under this section for any drug or device shall be the
    only official name of that drug or device used in any official
    compendium published after such name has been prescribed or for any
    other purpose of this chapter. In no event, however, shall the
    Secretary establish an official name so as to infringe a valid
    trademark.
    (b) Review of names in official compendiums
      Within a reasonable time after October 10, 1962, and at such
    other times as he may deem necessary, the Secretary shall cause a
    review to be made of the official names by which drugs are
    identified in the official United States Pharmacopoeia, the
    official Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States, and the
    official National Formulary, and all supplements thereto, and at
    such times as he may deem necessary shall cause a review to be made
    of the official names by which devices are identified in any
    official compendium (and all supplements thereto) to determine
    whether revision of any of those names is necessary or desirable in
    the interest of usefulness and simplicity.
    (c) Determinations of complexity, usefulness, multiplicity, or lack
      of name; designation by Secretary
      Whenever he determines after any such review that (1) any such
    official name is unduly complex or is not useful for any other
    reason, (2) two or more official names have been applied to a
    single drug or device, or to two or more drugs which are identical
    in chemical structure and pharmacological action and which are
    substantially identical in strength, quality, and purity, or to two
    or more devices which are substantially equivalent in design and
    purpose or (3) no official name has been applied to a medically
    useful drug or device, he shall transmit in writing to the compiler
    of each official compendium in which that drug or drugs or device
    are identified and recognized his request for the recommendation of
    a single official name for such drug or drugs or device which will
    have usefulness and simplicity. Whenever such a single official
    name has not been recommended within one hundred and eighty days
    after such request, or the Secretary determines that any name so
    recommended is not useful for any reason, he shall designate a
    single official name for such drug or drugs or device. Whenever he
    determines that the name so recommended is useful, he shall
    designate that name as the official name of such drug or drugs or
    device. Such designation shall be made as a regulation upon public
    notice and in accordance with the procedure set forth in section
    553 of title 5.
    (d) Revised official names; compilation, publication, and public
      distribution of listings
      After each such review, and at such other times as the Secretary
    may determine to be necessary or desirable, the Secretary shall
    cause to be compiled, published, and publicly distributed a list
    which shall list all revised official names of drugs or devices
    designated under this section and shall contain such descriptive
    and explanatory matter as the Secretary may determine to be
    required for the effective use of those names.
    (e) Request by compiler of official compendium for designation of
      name
      Upon a request in writing by any compiler of an official
    compendium that the Secretary exercise the authority granted to him
    under subsection (a) of this section, he shall upon public notice
    and in accordance with the procedure set forth in section 553 of
    title 5 designate the official name of the drug or device for which
    the request is made.

    (f) Availability of registrations for inspection
      The Secretary shall make available for inspection, to any person
    so requesting, any registration filed pursuant to this section;
    except that any list submitted pursuant to paragraph (3) of
    subsection (j) of this section and the information accompanying any
    list or notice filed under paragraph (1) or (2) of that subsection
    shall be exempt from such inspection unless the Secretary finds
    that such an exemption would be inconsistent with protection of the
    public health.
    (g) Exclusions from application of section
      The foregoing subsections of this section shall not apply to - 
        (1) pharmacies which maintain establishments in conformance

      dispensing prescription drugs or devices, upon prescriptions of
      practitioners licensed to administer such drugs or devices to
      patients under the care of such practitioners in the course of
      their professional practice, and which do not manufacture,

      sale other than in the regular course of their business of
      dispensing or selling drugs or devices at retail;
        (2) practitioners licensed by law to prescribe or administer
      drugs or devices and who manufacture, prepare, propagate,
      compound, or process drugs or devices solely for use in the
      course of their professional practice;

      process drugs or devices solely for use in research, teaching, or
      chemical analysis and not for sale;
        (4) any distributor who acts as a wholesale distributor of
      devices, and who does not manufacture, repackage, process, or
      relabel a device; or
        (5) such other classes of persons as the Secretary may by
      regulation exempt from the application of this section upon a
      finding that registration by such classes of persons in
      accordance with this section is not necessary for the protection
      of the public health.

    In this subsection, the term "wholesale distributor" means any
    person (other than the manufacturer or the initial importer) who
    distributes a device from the original place of manufacture to the
    person who makes the final delivery or sale of the device to the
    ultimate consumer or user.
    (h) Inspection of premises
      Every establishment in any State registered with the Secretary
    pursuant to this section shall be subject to inspection pursuant to
    section 374 of this title and every such establishment engaged in
    the manufacture, propagation, compounding, or processing of a drug
    or drugs or of a device or devices classified in class II or III
    shall be so inspected by one or more officers or employees duly
    designated by the Secretary, or by persons accredited to conduct
    inspections under section 374(g) of this title, at least once in
    the two-year period beginning with the date of registration of such
    establishment pursuant to this section and at least once in every
    successive two-year period thereafter.

    device in the United States that is known to the establishment, and
    the name of each person who imports or offers for import such drug
    or device to the United States for purposes of importation.
      (2) The establishment shall also provide the information required
    by subsection (j) of this section.
      (3) The Secretary is authorized to enter into cooperative
    arrangements with officials of foreign countries to ensure that

    determining, from time to time, whether drugs or devices
    manufactured, prepared, propagated, compounded, or processed by an
    establishment described in paragraph (1), if imported or offered
    for import into the United States, shall be refused admission on
    any of the grounds set forth in section 381(a) of this title.

    of registration under any such subsection, file with the Secretary
    a list of all drugs and a list of all devices and a brief statement
    of the basis for believing that each device included in the list is
    a device rather than a drug (with each drug and device in each list
    listed by its established name (as defined in section 352(e) of
    this title) and by any proprietary name) which are being
    manufactured, prepared, propagated, compounded, or processed by him
    for commercial distribution and which he has not included in any
    list of drugs or devices filed by him with the Secretary under this
    paragraph or paragraph (2) before such time of registration. Such
    list shall be prepared in such form and manner as the Secretary may
    prescribe and shall be accompanied by - 
        (A) in the case of a drug contained in the applicable list and
      subject to section 355 or 360b of this title, or a device
      intended for human use contained in the applicable list with
      respect to which a performance standard has been established
      under section 360d of this title or which is subject to section
      360e of this title, a reference to the authority for the
      marketing of such drug or device and a copy of all labeling for
      such drug or device;
        (B) in the case of any other drug or device contained in an

        for a particular drug product or device, or
          (ii) which drug is not subject to section 353(b)(1) of this
        title or which device is not a restricted device, the label and
        package insert for such drug or device and a representative
        sampling of any other labeling for such drug or device;

        (C) in the case of any drug contained in an applicable list
      which is described in subparagraph (B), a quantitative listing of
      its active ingredient or ingredients, except that with respect to
      a particular drug product the Secretary may require the
      submission of a quantitative listing of all ingredients if he
      finds that such submission is necessary to carry out the purposes
      of this chapter; and
        (D) if the registrant filing a list has determined that a
      particular drug product or device contained in such list is not
      subject to section 355 or 360b of this title, or the particular
      device contained in such list is not subject to a performance
      standard established under section 360d of this title or to
      section 360e of this title or is not a restricted device a brief
      statement of the basis upon which the registrant made such
      determination if the Secretary requests such a statement with
      respect to that particular drug product or device.

      (2) Each person who registers with the Secretary under this
    section shall report to the Secretary once during the month of June
    of each year and once during the month of December of each year the
    following information:
        (A) A list of each drug or device introduced by the registrant
      for commercial distribution which has not been included in any
      list previously filed by him with the Secretary under this
      subparagraph or paragraph (1) of this subsection. A list under
      this subparagraph shall list a drug or device by its established
      name (as defined in section 352(e) of this title), and by any
      proprietary name it may have and shall be accompanied by the
      other information required by paragraph (1).
        (B) If since the date the registrant last made a report under
      this paragraph (or if he has not made a report under this
      paragraph, since February 1, 1973) he has discontinued the
      manufacture, preparation, propagation, compounding, or processing
      for commercial distribution of a drug or device included in a
      list filed by him under subparagraph (A) or paragraph (1); notice
      of such discontinuance, the date of such discontinuance, and the
      identity (by established name (as defined in section 352(e) of
      this title) and by any proprietary name) of such drug or device.
        (C) If since the date the registrant reported pursuant to
      subparagraph (B) a notice of discontinuance he has resumed the
      manufacture, preparation, propagation, compounding, or processing
      for commercial distribution of the drug or device with respect to
      which such notice of discontinuance was reported; notice of such
      resumption, the date of such resumption, the identity of such
      drug or device (each by established name (as defined in section
      352(e) of this title) and by any proprietary name), and the other
      information required by paragraph (1), unless the registrant has
      previously reported such resumption to the Secretary pursuant to
      this subparagraph.
        (D) Any material change in any information previously submitted
      pursuant to this paragraph or paragraph (1).

      (3) The Secretary may also require each registrant under this
    section to submit a list of each drug product which (A) the
    registrant is manufacturing, preparing, propagating, compounding,
    or processing for commercial distribution, and (B) contains a
    particular ingredient. The Secretary may not require the submission
    of such a list unless he has made a finding that the submission of
    such a list is necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter.
    (k) Report preceding introduction of devices into interstate
      commerce
      Each person who is required to register under this section and
    who proposes to begin the introduction or delivery for introduction
    into interstate commerce for commercial distribution of a device
    intended for human use shall, at least ninety days before making
    such introduction or delivery, report to the Secretary or person
    who is accredited under section 360m(a) of this title (in such form
    and manner as the Secretary shall by regulation prescribe) - 
        (1) the class in which the device is classified under section
      360c of this title or if such person determines that the device
      is not classified under such section, a statement of that
      determination and the basis for such person's determination that
      the device is or is not so classified, and
        (2) action taken by such person to comply with requirements
      under section 360d or 360e of this title which are applicable to
      the device.
    (l) Exemption from reporting requirements
      A report under subsection (k) of this section is not required for
    a device intended for human use that is exempted from the
    requirements of this subsection under subsection (m) of this
    section or is within a type that has been classified into class I
    under section 360c of this title. The exception established in the
    preceding sentence does not apply to any class I device that is
    intended for a use which is of substantial importance in preventing
    impairment of human health, or to any class I device that presents
    a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury.
    (m) List of exempt class II devices; determination by Secretary;
      publication in Federal Register
      (1) Not later than 60 days after November 21, 1997, the Secretary
    shall publish in the Federal Register a list of each type of class
    II device that does not require a report under subsection (k) of
    this section to provide reasonable assurance of safety and
    effectiveness. Each type of class II device identified by the
    Secretary as not requiring the report shall be exempt from the
    requirement to provide a report under subsection (k) of this
    section as of the date of the publication of the list in the
    Federal Register. The Secretary shall publish such list on the
    Internet site of the Food and Drug Administration. The list so
    published shall be updated not later than 30 days after each
    revision of the list by the Secretary.
      (2) Beginning on the date that is 1 day after the date of the
    publication of a list under this subsection, the Secretary may
    exempt a class II device from the requirement to submit a report
    under subsection (k) of this section, upon the Secretary's own
    initiative or a petition of an interested person, if the Secretary
    determines that such report is not necessary to assure the safety
    and effectiveness of the device. The Secretary shall publish in the
    Federal Register notice of the intent of the Secretary to exempt
    the device, or of the petition, and provide a 30-day period for
    public comment. Within 120 days after the issuance of the notice in
    the Federal Register, the Secretary shall publish an order in the
    Federal Register that sets forth the final determination of the
    Secretary regarding the exemption of the device that was the
    subject of the notice. If the Secretary fails to respond to a
    petition within 180 days of receiving it, the petition shall be
    deemed to be granted.
    (n) Review of report; time for determination by Secretary
      The Secretary shall review the report required in subsection (k)
    of this section and make a determination under section 360c(f)(1)
    of this title not later than 90 days after receiving the report.
    (o) Reprocessed single-use devices
      (1) With respect to reprocessed single-use devices for which
    reports are required under subsection (k) of this section:
        (A) The Secretary shall identify such devices or types of
      devices for which reports under such subsection must, in order to
      ensure that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate
      device, include validation data, the types of which shall be
      specified by the Secretary, regarding cleaning and sterilization,
      and functional performance demonstrating that the single-use
      device will remain substantially equivalent to its predicate
      device after the maximum number of times the device is
      reprocessed as intended by the person submitting the premarket
      notification. Within six months after October 26, 2002, the
      Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register a list of the
      types so identified, and shall revise the list as appropriate.
      Reports under subsection (k) of this section for devices or types
      of devices within a type included on the list are, upon
      publication of the list, required to include such validation
      data.
        (B) In the case of each report under subsection (k) of this
      section that was submitted to the Secretary before the
      publication of the initial list under subparagraph (A), or any
      revision thereof, and was for a device or type of device included
      on such list, the person who submitted the report under
      subsection (k) of this section shall submit validation data as
      described in subparagraph (A) to the Secretary not later than
      nine months after the publication of the list. During such nine-
      month period, the Secretary may not take any action under this
      chapter against such device solely on the basis that the
      validation data for the device have not been submitted to the
      Secretary. After the submission of the validation data to the
      Secretary, the Secretary may not determine that the device is
      misbranded under section 352(o) of this title or adulterated
      under section 351(f)(1)(B) of this title, or take action against
      the device under section 331(p) of this title for failure to
      provide any information required by subsection (k) of this
      section until (i) the review is terminated by withdrawal of the
      submission of the report under subsection (k) of this section;
      (ii) the Secretary finds the data to be acceptable and issues a
      letter; or (iii) the Secretary determines that the device is not
      substantially equivalent to a predicate device. Upon a
      determination that a device is not substantially equivalent to a
      predicate device, or if such submission is withdrawn, the device
      can no longer be legally marketed.
        (C) In the case of a report under subsection (k) of this
      section for a device identified under subparagraph (A) that is of
      a type for which the Secretary has not previously received a
      report under such subsection, the Secretary may, in advance of
      revising the list under subparagraph (A) to include such type,
      require that the report include the validation data specified in
      subparagraph (A).
        (D) Section 352(o) of this title applies with respect to the
      failure of a report under subsection (k) of this section to
      include validation data required under subparagraph (A).

      (2) With respect to critical or semi-critical reprocessed single-
    use devices that, under subsection (l) or (m) of this section, are
    exempt from the requirement of submitting reports under subsection
    (k) of this section:
        (A) The Secretary shall identify such devices or types of
      devices for which such exemptions should be terminated in order
      to provide a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness
      of the devices. The Secretary shall publish in the Federal
      Register a list of the devices or types of devices so identified,
      and shall revise the list as appropriate. The exemption for each
      device or type included on the list is terminated upon the
      publication of the list. For each report under subsection (k) of
      this section submitted pursuant to this subparagraph the
      Secretary shall require the validation data described in
      paragraph (1)(A).
        (B) For each device or type of device included on the list
      under subparagraph (A), a report under subsection (k) of this
      section shall be submitted to the Secretary not later than 15
      months after the publication of the initial list, or a revision
      of the list, whichever terminates the exemption for the device.
      During such 15-month period, the Secretary may not take any
      action under this chapter against such device solely on the basis
      that such report has not been submitted to the Secretary. After
      the submission of the report to the Secretary the Secretary may
      not determine that the device is misbranded under section 352(o)
      of this title or adulterated under section 351(f)(1)(B) of this
      title, or take action against the device under section 331(p) of
      this title for failure to provide any information required by
      subsection (k) of this section until (i) the review is terminated
      by withdrawal of the submission; (ii) the Secretary determines by
      order that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate
      device; or (iii) the Secretary determines by order that the
      device is not substantially equivalent to a predicate device.
      Upon a determination that a device is not substantially
      equivalent to a predicate device, the device can no longer be
      legally marketed.
        (C) In the case of semi-critical devices, the initial list
      under subparagraph (A) shall be published not later than 18
      months after the effective date of this subsection. In the case
      of critical devices, the initial list under such subparagraph
      shall be published not later than six months after such effective
      date.
        (D) Section 352(o) of this title applies with respect to the
      failure to submit a report under subsection (k) of this section
      that is required pursuant to subparagraph (A), including a
      failure of the report to include validation data required in such
      subparagraph.
        (E) The termination under subparagraph (A) of an exemption
      under subsection (l) or (m) of this section for a critical or
      semi-critical reprocessed single-use device does not terminate
      the exemption under subsection (l) or (m) of this section for the
      original device.
    (p) Electronic registration
      Registrations under subsections (b), (c), (d), and (i) of this
    section (including the submission of updated information) shall be
    submitted to the Secretary by electronic means, upon a finding by
    the Secretary that the electronic receipt of such registrations is
    feasible, unless the Secretary grants a request for waiver of such
    requirement because use of electronic means is not reasonable for
    the person requesting such waiver.

     CONGRESSIONAL DECLARATION OF NEED FOR REGISTRATION AND INSPECTION
                          OF DRUG ESTABLISHMENTS
      Section 301 of Pub. L. 87-781 provided that: "The Congress hereby
    finds and declares that in order to make regulation of interstate
    commerce in drugs effective, it is necessary to provide for
    registration and inspection of all establishments in which drugs
    are manufactured, prepared, propagated, compounded, or processed;
    that the products of all such establishments are likely to enter
    the channels of interstate commerce and directly affect such
    commerce; and that the regulation of interstate commerce in drugs
    without provision for registration and inspection of establishments
    that may be engaged only in intrastate commerce in such drugs would
    discriminate against and depress interstate commerce in such drugs,
    and adversely burden, obstruct, and affect such interstate
    commerce."

             DECLARATION OF POLICY OF DRUG LISTING ACT OF 1972         
      Section 2 of Pub. L. 92-387 provided that: "The Federal
    Government which is responsible for regulating drugs has no ready
    means of determining what drugs are actually being manufactured or
    packed by establishments registered under the Federal Food, Drug,
    and Cosmetic Act [this chapter] except by periodic inspection of
    such registered establishments. Knowledge of which particular drugs
    are being manufactured or packed by each registered establishment
    would substantially assist in the enforcement of Federal laws
    requiring that such drugs be pure, safe, effective, and properly
    labeled. Information on the discontinuance of a particular drug
    could serve to alleviate the burden of reviewing and implementing
    enforcement actions against drugs which, although commercially
    discontinued, remain active for regulatory purposes. Information on
    the type and number of different drugs being manufactured or packed
    by drug establishments could permit more effective and timely
    regulation by the agencies of the Federal Government responsible
    for regulating drugs, including identification of which drugs in
    interstate commerce are subject to section 505 or 507 [section 355
    or 357 of this title], or to other provisions of the Federal Food,
    Drug, and Cosmetic Act."

         REGISTRATION OF CERTAIN PERSONS OWNING OR OPERATING DRUG
                   ESTABLISHMENTS PRIOR TO OCT. 10, 1962
      Section 303 of Pub. L. 87-781 provided that any person who, on
    the day immediately preceding Oct. 10, 1962, owned or operated an
    establishment which manufactured or processed drugs, registered
    before the first day of the seventh month following October, 1962,
    would be deemed to be registered in accordance with subsec. (b) of
    this section for the calendar year 1962 and if registered within
    this period and effected in 1963, be deemed in compliance for that
    calendar year.

    A new animal drug shall also be deemed unsafe for such purposes in
    the event of removal from the establishment of a manufacturer,

    animal feed in any State unless at the time of such removal such
    manufacturer, packer, or distributor has an unrevoked written
    statement from the consignee of such drug, or notice from the
    Secretary, to the effect that, with respect to the use of such drug
    in animal feed, such consignee (i) holds a license issued under
    subsection (m) of this section and has in its possession current
    approved labeling for such drug in animal feed; or (ii) will, if
    the consignee is not a user of the drug, ship such drug only to a
    holder of a license issued under subsection (m) of this section.
      (2) An animal feed bearing or containing a new animal drug shall,
    with respect to any particular use or intended use of such animal
    feed be deemed unsafe for purposes of section 351(a)(6) of this
    title unless -

        (B) such animal feed is manufactured at a site for which there
      is in effect a license issued pursuant to subsection (m)(1) of
      this section to manufacture such animal feed.

      (3) A new animal drug or an animal feed bearing or containing a
    new animal drug shall not be deemed unsafe for the purposes of

    animal drug, the drug shall not be deemed unsafe for the purposes
    of paragraph (1) and shall be exempt from the requirements of
    section 352(f) of this title with respect to a different use or
    intended use of the drug, other than a use in or on animal feed, if
    such use or intended use - 
        (i) is by or on the lawful written or oral order of a licensed
      veterinarian within the context of a veterinarian-client-patient
      relationship, as defined by the Secretary; and
        (ii) is in compliance with regulations promulgated by the
      Secretary that establish the conditions for such different use or
      intended use.

    prohibit particular uses of an animal drug and shall not permit
    such different use of an animal drug if the labeling of another
    animal drug that contains the same active ingredient and which is
    in the same dosage form and concentration provides for such
    different use.

      and
        (ii) require the development of a practical, analytical method
      for the detection of residues of such drug above the safe level
      established under clause (i).

    The use of an animal drug that results in residues exceeding a safe
    level established under clause (i) shall be considered an unsafe
    use of such drug under paragraph (1). Safe levels may be
    established under clause (i) either by regulation or order.
      (C) The Secretary may by general regulation provide access to the
    records of veterinarians to ascertain any use or intended use
    authorized under subparagraph (A) that the Secretary has determined
    may present a risk to the public health.
      (D) If the Secretary finds, after affording an opportunity for
    public comment, that a use of an animal drug authorized under
    subparagraph (A) presents a risk to the public health or that an
    analytical method required under subparagraph (B) has not been
    developed and submitted to the Secretary, the Secretary may, by
    order, prohibit any such use.
      (5) If the approval of an application filed under section 355 of
    this title is in effect, the drug under such application shall not
    be deemed unsafe for purposes of paragraph (1) and shall be exempt
    from the requirements of section 352(f) of this title with respect
    to a use or intended use of the drug in animals if such use or
    intended use - 
        (A) is by or on the lawful written or oral order of a licensed
      veterinarian within the context of a veterinarian-client-patient
      relationship, as defined by the Secretary; and
        (B) is in compliance with regulations promulgated by the
      Secretary that establish the conditions for the use or intended
      use of the drug in animals.
      (6) For purposes of section 342(a)(2)(D) (!1) of this title, a
    use or intended use of a new animal drug shall not be deemed unsafe
    under this section if the Secretary establishes a tolerance for
    such drug and any edible portion of any animal imported into the
    United States does not contain residues exceeding such tolerance.
    In establishing such tolerance, the Secretary shall rely on data
    sufficient to demonstrate that a proposed tolerance is safe based
    on similar food safety criteria used by the Secretary to establish
    tolerances for applications for new animal drugs filed under
    subsection (b)(1) of this section. The Secretary may consider and
    rely on data submitted by the drug manufacturer, including data
    submitted to appropriate regulatory authorities in any country
    where the new animal drug is lawfully used or data available from a
    relevant international organization, to the extent such data are
    not inconsistent with the criteria used by the Secretary to
    establish a tolerance for applications for new animal drugs filed
    under subsection (b)(1) of this section. For purposes of this
    paragraph, "relevant international organization" means the Codex
    Alimenterius (!2) Commission or other international organization
    deemed appropriate by the Secretary. The Secretary may, under
    procedures specified by regulation, revoke a tolerance established
    under this paragraph if information demonstrates that the use of
    the new animal drug under actual use conditions results in food
    being imported into the United States with residues exceeding the
    tolerance or if scientific evidence shows the tolerance to be
    unsafe.


    (b) Filing application for uses of new animal drug; contents;
      patent information; abbreviated application; presubmission
      conference
      (1) Any person may file with the Secretary an application with
    respect to any intended use or uses of a new animal drug. Such
    person shall submit to the Secretary as a part of the application
    (A) full reports of investigations which have been made to show
    whether or not such drug is safe and effective for use; (B) a full
    list of the articles used as components of such drug; (C) a full
    statement of the composition of such drug; (D) a full description
    of the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for,
    the manufacture, processing, and packing of such drug; (E) such
    samples of such drug and of the articles used as components
    thereof, of any animal feed for use in or on which such drug is
    intended, and of the edible portions or products (before or after
    slaughter) of animals to which such drug (directly or in or on
    animal feed) is intended to be administered, as the Secretary may
    require; (F) specimens of the labeling proposed to be used for such
    drug, or in case such drug is intended for use in animal feed,
    proposed labeling appropriate for such use, and specimens of the
    labeling for the drug to be manufactured, packed, or distributed by
    the applicant; (G) a description of practicable methods for
    determining the quantity, if any, of such drug in or on food, and
    any substance formed in or on food, because of its use; and (H) the
    proposed tolerance or withdrawal period or other use restrictions
    for such drug if any tolerance or withdrawal period or other use
    restrictions are required in order to assure that the proposed use
    of such drug will be safe. The applicant shall file with the
    application the patent number and the expiration date of any patent
    which claims the new animal drug for which the applicant filed the
    application or which claims a method of using such drug and with
    respect to which a claim of patent infringement could reasonably be
    asserted if a person not licensed by the owner engaged in the
    manufacture, use, or sale of the drug. If an application is filed
    under this subsection for a drug and a patent which claims such
    drug or a method of using such drug is issued after the filing date
    but before approval of the application, the applicant shall amend
    the application to include the information required by the
    preceding sentence. Upon approval of the application, the Secretary
    shall publish information submitted under the two preceding
    sentences.
      (2) Any person may file with the Secretary an abbreviated
    application for the approval of a new animal drug. An abbreviated
    application shall contain the information required by subsection
    (n) of this section.
      (3) Any person intending to file an application under paragraph
    (1), section 360ccc of this title, or a request for an
    investigational exemption under subsection (j) of this section
    shall be entitled to one or more conferences prior to such
    submission to reach an agreement acceptable to the Secretary
    establishing a submission or an investigational requirement, which
    may include a requirement for a field investigation. A decision
    establishing a submission or an investigational requirement shall
    bind the Secretary and the applicant or requestor unless (A) the
    Secretary and the applicant or requestor mutually agree to modify
    the requirement, or (B) the Secretary by written order determines
    that a substantiated scientific requirement essential to the
    determination of safety or effectiveness of the animal drug
    involved has appeared after the conference. No later than 25
    calendar days after each such conference, the Secretary shall
    provide a written order setting forth a scientific justification
    specific to the animal drug and intended uses under consideration
    if the agreement referred to in the first sentence requires more
    than one field investigation as being essential to provide
    substantial evidence of effectiveness for the intended uses of the
    drug. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as compelling
    the Secretary to require a field investigation.
    (c) Period for submission and approval of application; period for
      notice and expedition of hearing; period for issuance of order;
      abbreviated applications; withdrawal periods; effective date of
      approval; relationship to other applications; withdrawal or
      suspension of approval; bioequivalence; filing of additional
      patent information
      (1) Within one hundred and eighty days after the filing of an
    application pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, or such
    additional period as may be agreed upon by the Secretary and the
    applicant, the Secretary shall either (A) issue an order approving
    the application if he then finds that none of the grounds for
    denying approval specified in subsection (d) of this section
    applies, or (B) give the applicant notice of an opportunity for a
    hearing before the Secretary under subsection (d) of this section
    on the question whether such application is approvable. If the
    applicant elects to accept the opportunity for a hearing by written
    request within thirty days after such notice, such hearing shall
    commence not more than ninety days after the expiration of such
    thirty days unless the Secretary and the applicant otherwise agree.
    Any such hearing shall thereafter be conducted on an expedited
    basis and the Secretary's order thereon shall be issued within
    ninety days after the date fixed by the Secretary for filing final
    briefs.
      (2)(A) Subject to subparagraph (C), the Secretary shall approve
    an abbreviated application for a drug unless the Secretary finds - 
        (i) the methods used in, or the facilities and controls used
      for, the manufacture, processing, and packing of the drug are
      inadequate to assure and preserve its identity, strength,
      quality, and purity;
        (ii) the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or
      suggested in the proposed labeling are not reasonably certain to
      be followed in practice or, except as provided in subparagraph
      (B), information submitted with the application is insufficient
      to show that each of the proposed conditions of use or similar
      limitations (whether in the labeling or published pursuant to
      subsection (i) of this section) have been previously approved for
      the approved new animal drug referred to in the application;
        (iii) information submitted with the application is
      insufficient to show that the active ingredients are the same as
      those of the approved new animal drug referred to in the
      application;
        (iv)(I) if the application is for a drug whose active
      ingredients, route of administration, dosage form, strength, or
      use with other animal drugs in animal feed is the same as the
      active ingredients, route of administration, dosage form,
      strength, or use with other animal drugs in animal feed of the
      approved new animal drug referred to in the application,
      information submitted in the application is insufficient to show
      that the active ingredients, route of administration, dosage
      form, strength, or use with other animal drugs in animal feed is
      the same as that of the approved new animal drug, or
        (II) if the application is for a drug whose active ingredients,
      route of administration, dosage form, strength, or use with other
      animal drugs in animal feed is different from that of the
      approved new animal drug referred to in the application, no
      petition to file an application for the drug with the different
      active ingredients, route of administration, dosage form,
      strength, or use with other animal drugs in animal feed was
      approved under subsection (n)(3) of this section;
        (v) if the application was filed pursuant to the approval of a
      petition under subsection (n)(3) of this section, the application
      did not contain the information required by the Secretary
      respecting the active ingredients, route of administration,
      dosage form, strength, or use with other animal drugs in animal
      feed which is not the same;
        (vi) information submitted in the application is insufficient
      to show that the drug is bioequivalent to the approved new animal
      drug referred to in the application, or if the application is
      filed under a petition approved pursuant to subsection (n)(3) of
      this section, information submitted in the application is
      insufficient to show that the active ingredients of the new
      animal drug are of the same pharmacological or therapeutic class
      as the pharmacological or therapeutic class of the approved new
      animal drug and that the new animal drug can be expected to have
      the same therapeutic effect as the approved new animal drug when
      used in accordance with the labeling;
        (vii) information submitted in the application is insufficient
      to show that the labeling proposed for the drug is the same as
      the labeling approved for the approved new animal drug referred
      to in the application except for changes required because of
      differences approved under a petition filed under subsection
      (n)(3) of this section, because of a different withdrawal period,
      or because the drug and the approved new animal drug are produced
      or distributed by different manufacturers;
        (viii) information submitted in the application or any other
      information available to the Secretary shows that (I) the
      inactive ingredients of the drug are unsafe for use under the
      conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling
      proposed for the drug, (II) the composition of the drug is unsafe
      under such conditions because of the type or quantity of inactive
      ingredients included or the manner in which the inactive
      ingredients are included, or (III) in the case of a drug for food
      producing animals, the inactive ingredients of the drug or its
      composition may be unsafe with respect to human food safety;
        (ix) the approval under subsection (b)(1) of this section of
      the approved new animal drug referred to in the application filed
      under subsection (b)(2) of this section has been withdrawn or
      suspended for grounds described in paragraph (1) of subsection
      (e) of this section, the Secretary has published a notice of a
      hearing to withdraw approval of the approved new animal drug for
      such grounds, the approval under this paragraph of the new animal
      drug for which the application under subsection (b)(2) of this
      section was filed has been withdrawn or suspended under
      subparagraph (G) for such grounds, or the Secretary has
      determined that the approved new animal drug has been withdrawn
      from sale for safety or effectiveness reasons;
        (x) the application does not meet any other requirement of
      subsection (n) of this section; or
        (xi) the application contains an untrue statement of material
      fact.

      (B) If the Secretary finds that a new animal drug for which an
    application is submitted under subsection (b)(2) of this section is
    bioequivalent to the approved new animal drug referred to in such
    application and that residues of the new animal drug are consistent
    with the tolerances established for such approved new animal drug
    but at a withdrawal period which is different than the withdrawal
    period approved for such approved new animal drug, the Secretary
    may establish, on the basis of information submitted, such
    different withdrawal period as the withdrawal period for the new
    animal drug for purposes of the approval of such application for
    such drug.
      (C) Within 180 days of the initial receipt of an application
    under subsection (b)(2) of this section or within such additional
    period as may be agreed upon by the Secretary and the applicant,
    the Secretary shall approve or disapprove the application.
      (D) The approval of an application filed under subsection (b)(2)
    of this section shall be made effective on the last applicable date
    determined under the following:
        (i) If the applicant only made a certification described in
      clause (i) or (ii) of subsection (n)(1)(G) of this section or in
      both such clauses, the approval may be made effective
      immediately.
        (ii) If the applicant made a certification described in clause
      (iii) of subsection (n)(1)(G) of this section, the approval may
      be made effective on the date certified under clause (iii).
        (iii) If the applicant made a certification described in clause
      (iv) of subsection (n)(1)(G) of this section, the approval shall
      be made effective immediately unless an action is brought for
      infringement of a patent which is the subject of the
      certification before the expiration of 45 days from the date the
      notice provided under subsection (n)(2)(B)(i) of this section is
      received. If such an action is brought before the expiration of
      such days, the approval shall be made effective upon the
      expiration of the 30 month period beginning on the date of the
      receipt of the notice provided under subsection (n)(2)(B) of this
      section or such shorter or longer period as the court may order
      because either party to the action failed to reasonably cooperate
      in expediting the action, except that if before the expiration of
      such period - 
          (I) the court decides that such patent is invalid or not
        infringed, the approval shall be made effective on the date of
        the court decision,
          (II) the court decides that such patent has been infringed,
        the approval shall be made effective on such date as the court
        orders under section 271(e)(4)(A) of title 35, or
          (III) the court grants a preliminary injunction prohibiting
        the applicant from engaging in the commercial manufacture or
        sale of the drug until the court decides the issues of patent
        validity and infringement and if the court decides that such
        patent is invalid or not infringed, the approval shall be made
        effective on the date of such court decision.

      In such an action, each of the parties shall reasonably cooperate
      in expediting the action. Until the expiration of 45 days from
      the date the notice made under subsection (n)(2)(B) of this
      section is received, no action may be brought under section 2201
      of title 28 for a declaratory judgment with respect to the
      patent. Any action brought under section 2201 of title 28 shall
      be brought in the judicial district where the defendant has its
      principal place of business or a regular and established place of
      business.
        (iv) If the application contains a certification described in
      clause (iv) of subsection (n)(1)(G) of this section and is for a
      drug for which a previous application has been filed under this
      subsection containing such a certification, the application shall
      be made effective not earlier than 180 days after - 
          (I) the date the Secretary receives notice from the applicant
        under the previous application of the first commercial
        marketing of the drug under the previous application, or
          (II) the date of a decision of a court in an action described
        in subclause (III) (!3) holding the patent which is the subject
        of the certification to be invalid or not infringed,


      whichever is earlier.

      (E) If the Secretary decides to disapprove an application, the
    Secretary shall give the applicant notice of an opportunity for a
    hearing before the Secretary on the question of whether such
    application is approvable. If the applicant elects to accept the
    opportunity for hearing by written request within 30 days after
    such notice, such hearing shall commence not more than 90 days
    after the expiration of such 30 days unless the Secretary and the
    applicant otherwise agree. Any such hearing shall thereafter be
    conducted on an expedited basis and the Secretary's order thereon
    shall be issued within 90 days after the date fixed by the
    Secretary for filing final briefs.
      (F)(i) If an application submitted under subsection (b)(1) of
    this section for a drug, no active ingredient (including any ester
    or salt of the active ingredient) of which has been approved in any
    other application under subsection (b)(1) of this section, is
    approved after November 16, 1988, no application may be submitted
    under subsection (b)(2) of this section which refers to the drug
    for which the subsection (b)(1) application was submitted before
    the expiration of 5 years from the date of the approval of the
    application under subsection (b)(1) of this section, except that
    such an application may be submitted under subsection (b)(2) of
    this section after the expiration of 4 years from the date of the
    approval of the subsection (b)(1) application if it contains a
    certification of patent invalidity or noninfringement described in
    clause (iv) of subsection (n)(1)(G) of this section. The approval
    of such an application shall be made effective in accordance with
    subparagraph (B) except that, if an action for patent infringement
    is commenced during the one-year period beginning 48 months after
    the date of the approval of the subsection (b) application, the 30
    month period referred to in subparagraph (D)(iii) shall be extended
    by such amount of time (if any) which is required for seven and one-
    half years to have elapsed from the date of approval of the
    subsection (b) application.
      (ii) If an application submitted under subsection (b)(1) of this
    section for a drug, which includes an active ingredient (including
    any ester or salt of the active ingredient) that has been approved
    in another application approved under such subsection, is approved
    after November 16, 1988, and if such application contains
    substantial evidence of the effectiveness of the drug involved, any
    studies of animal safety, or, in the case of food producing
    animals, human food safety studies (other than bioequivalence
    studies or residue depletion studies, except residue depletion
    studies for minor uses or minor species) required for the approval
    of the application and conducted or sponsored by the applicant, the
    Secretary may not make the approval of an application submitted
    under subsection (b)(2) of this section for the conditions of
    approval of such drug in the subsection (b)(1) application
    effective before the expiration of 3 years from the date of the
    approval of the application under subsection (b)(1) of this section
    for such drug.
      (iii) If a supplement to an application approved under subsection
    (b)(1) of this section is approved after November 16, 1988, and the
    supplement contains substantial evidence of the effectiveness of
    the drug involved, any studies of animal safety, or, in the case of
    food producing animals, human food safety studies (other than
    bioequivalence studies or residue depletion studies, except residue
    depletion studies for minor uses or minor species) required for the
    approval of the supplement and conducted or sponsored by the person
    submitting the supplement, the Secretary may not make the approval
    of an application submitted under subsection (b)(2) of this section
    for a change approved in the supplement effective before the
    expiration of 3 years from the date of the approval of the
    supplement.
      (iv) An applicant under subsection (b)(1) of this section who
    comes within the provisions of clause (i) of this subparagraph as a
    result of an application which seeks approval for a use solely in
    non-food producing animals, may elect, within 10 days of receiving
    such approval, to waive clause (i) of this subparagraph, in which
    event the limitation on approval of applications submitted under
    subsection (b)(2) of this section set forth in clause (ii) of this
    subparagraph shall be applicable to the subsection (b)(1)
    application.
      (v) If an application (including any supplement to a new animal
    drug application) submitted under subsection (b)(1) of this section
    for a new animal drug for a food-producing animal use, which
    includes an active ingredient (including any ester or salt of the
    active ingredient) which has been the subject of a waiver under
    clause (iv) is approved after November 16, 1988, and if the
    application contains substantial evidence of the effectiveness of
    the drug involved, any studies of animal safety, or human food
    safety studies (other than bioequivalence studies or residue
    depletion studies, except residue depletion studies for minor uses
    or minor species) required for the new approval of the application
    and conducted or sponsored by the applicant, the Secretary may not
    make the approval of an application (including any supplement to
    such application) submitted under subsection (b)(2) of this section
    for the new conditions of approval of such drug in the subsection
    (b)(1) application effective before the expiration of five years
    from the date of approval of the application under subsection
    (b)(1) of this section for such drug. The provisions of this
    paragraph shall apply only to the first approval for a food-
    producing animal use for the same applicant after the waiver under
    clause (iv).
      (G) If an approved application submitted under subsection (b)(2)
    of this section for a new animal drug refers to a drug the approval
    of which was withdrawn or suspended for grounds described in
    paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (e) of this section or was
    withdrawn or suspended under this subparagraph or which, as
    determined by the Secretary, has been withdrawn from sale for
    safety or effectiveness reasons, the approval of the drug under
    this paragraph shall be withdrawn or suspended - 
        (i) for the same period as the withdrawal or suspension under
      subsection (e) of this section or this subparagraph, or
        (ii) if the approved new animal drug has been withdrawn from
      sale, for the period of withdrawal from sale or, if earlier, the
      period ending on the date the Secretary determines that the
      withdrawal from sale is not for safety or effectiveness reasons.

      (H) For purposes of this paragraph:
        (i) The term "bioequivalence" means the rate and extent to
      which the active ingredient or therapeutic ingredient is absorbed
      from a new animal drug and becomes available at the site of drug
      action.
        (ii) A new animal drug shall be considered to be bioequivalent
      to the approved new animal drug referred to in its application
      under subsection (n) of this section if - 
          (I) the rate and extent of absorption of the drug do not show
        a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption
        of the approved new animal drug referred to in the application
        when administered at the same dose of the active ingredient
        under similar experimental conditions in either a single dose
        or multiple doses;
          (II) the extent of absorption of the drug does not show a
        significant difference from the extent of absorption of the
        approved new animal drug referred to in the application when
        administered at the same dose of the active ingredient under
        similar experimental conditions in either a single dose or
        multiple doses and the difference from the approved new animal
        drug in the rate of absorption of the drug is intentional, is
        reflected in its proposed labeling, is not essential to the
        attainment of effective drug concentrations in use, and is
        considered scientifically insignificant for the drug in
        attaining the intended purposes of its use and preserving human
        food safety; or
          (III) in any case in which the Secretary determines that the
        measurement of the rate and extent of absorption or excretion
        of the new animal drug in biological fluids is inappropriate or
        impractical, an appropriate acute pharmacological effects test
        or other test of the new animal drug and, when deemed
        scientifically necessary, of the approved new animal drug
        referred to in the application in the species to be tested or
        in an appropriate animal model does not show a significant
        difference between the new animal drug and such approved new
        animal drug when administered at the same dose under similar
        experimental conditions.

      If the approved new animal drug referred to in the application
      for a new animal drug under subsection (n) of this section is
      approved for use in more than one animal species, the
      bioequivalency information described in subclauses (I), (II), and
      (III) shall be obtained for one species, or if the Secretary
      deems appropriate based on scientific principles, shall be
      obtained for more than one species. The Secretary may prescribe
      the dose to be used in determining bioequivalency under subclause
      (I), (II), or (III). To assure that the residues of the new
      animal drug will be consistent with the established tolerances
      for the approved new animal drug referred to in the application
      under subsection (b)(2) of this section upon the expiration of
      the withdrawal period contained in the application for the new
      animal drug, the Secretary shall require bioequivalency data or
      residue depletion studies of the new animal drug or such other
      data or studies as the Secretary considers appropriate based on
      scientific principles. If the Secretary requires one or more
      residue studies under the preceding sentence, the Secretary may
      not require that the assay methodology used to determine the
      withdrawal period of the new animal drug be more rigorous than
      the methodology used to determine the withdrawal period for the
      approved new animal drug referred to in the application. If such
      studies are required and if the approved new animal drug,
      referred to in the application for the new animal drug for which
      such studies are required, is approved for use in more than one
      animal species, such studies shall be conducted for one species,
      or if the Secretary deems appropriate based on scientific
      principles, shall be conducted for more than one species.

      (3) If the patent information described in subsection (b)(1) of
    this section could not be filed with the submission of an
    application under subsection (b)(1) of this section because the
    application was filed before the patent information was required
    under subsection (b)(1) of this section or a patent was issued
    after the application was approved under such subsection, the
    holder of an approved application shall file with the Secretary the
    patent number and the expiration date of any patent which claims
    the new animal drug for which the application was filed or which
    claims a method of using such drug and with respect to which a
    claim of patent infringement could reasonably be asserted if a
    person not licensed by the owner engaged in the manufacture, use,
    or sale of the drug. If the holder of an approved application could
    not file patent information under subsection (b)(1) of this section
    because it was not required at the time the application was
    approved, the holder shall file such information under this
    subsection not later than 30 days after November 16, 1988, and if
    the holder of an approved application could not file patent
    information under subsection (b)(1) of this section because no
    patent had been issued when an application was filed or approved,
    the holder shall file such information under this subsection not
    later than 30 days after the date the patent involved is issued.
    Upon the submission of patent information under this subsection,
    the Secretary shall publish it.
      (4) A drug manufactured in a pilot or other small facility may be
    used to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the drug and to
    obtain approval for the drug prior to manufacture of the drug in a
    larger facility, unless the Secretary makes a determination that a
    full scale production facility is necessary to ensure the safety or
    effectiveness of the drug.
    (d) Grounds for refusing application; approval of application;
      factors; "substantial evidence" defined; combination drugs
      (1) If the Secretary finds, after due notice to the applicant in
    accordance with subsection (c) of this section and giving him an
    opportunity for a hearing, in accordance with said subsection, that
    - 
        (A) the investigations, reports of which are required to be
      submitted to the Secretary pursuant to subsection (b) of this
      section, do not include adequate tests by all methods reasonably
      applicable to show whether or not such drug is safe for use under
      the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the
      proposed labeling thereof;
        (B) the results of such tests show that such drug is unsafe for
      use under such conditions or do not show that such drug is safe
      for use under such conditions;
        (C) the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used
      for, the manufacture, processing, and packing of such drug are
      inadequate to preserve its identity, strength, quality, and
      purity;
        (D) upon the basis of the information submitted to him as part
      of the application, or upon the basis of any other information
      before him with respect to such drug, he has insufficient
      information to determine whether such drug is safe for use under
      such conditions;
        (E) evaluated on the basis of the information submitted to him
      as part of the application and any other information before him
      with respect to such drug, there is a lack of substantial
      evidence that the drug will have the effect it purports or is
      represented to have under the conditions of use prescribed,
      recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling thereof;
        (F) upon the basis of information submitted to the Secretary as
      part of the application or any other information before the
      Secretary with respect to such drug, any use prescribed,
      recommended, or suggested in labeling proposed for such drug will
      result in a residue of such drug in excess of a tolerance found
      by the Secretary to be safe for such drug;
        (G) the application failed to contain the patent information
      prescribed by subsection (b)(1) of this section;
        (H) based on a fair evaluation of all material facts, such
      labeling is false or misleading in any particular; or
        (I) such drug induces cancer when ingested by man or animal or,
      after tests which are appropriate for the evaluation of the
      safety of such drug, induces cancer in man or animal, except that
      the foregoing provisions of this subparagraph shall not apply
      with respect to such drug if the Secretary finds that, under the
      conditions of use specified in proposed labeling and reasonably
      certain to be followed in practice (i) such drug will not
      adversely affect the animals for which it is intended, and (ii)
      no residue of such drug will be found (by methods of examination
      prescribed or approved by the Secretary by regulations, which
      regulations shall not be subject to subsections (c), (d), and (h)
      of this section), in any edible portion of such animals after
      slaughter or in any food yielded by or derived from the living
      animals;

    he shall issue an order refusing to approve the application. If,
    after such notice and opportunity for hearings, the Secretary finds
    that subparagraphs (A) through (I) do not apply, he shall issue an
    order approving the application.
      (2) In determining whether such drug is safe for use under the
    conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed
    labeling thereof, the Secretary shall consider, among other
    relevant factors, (A) the probable consumption of such drug and of
    any substance formed in or on food because of the use of such drug,
    (B) the cumulative effect on man or animal of such drug, taking
    into account any chemically or pharmacologically related substance,
    (C) safety factors which in the opinion of experts, qualified by
    scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety of such
    drugs, are appropriate for the use of animal experimentation data,
    and (D) whether the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or
    suggested in the proposed labeling are reasonably certain to be
    followed in practice. Any order issued under this subsection
    refusing to approve an application shall state the findings upon
    which it is based.
      (3) As used in this section, the term "substantial evidence"
    means evidence consisting of one or more adequate and well
    controlled investigations, such as - 
        (A) a study in a target species;
        (B) a study in laboratory animals;
        (C) any field investigation that may be required under this
      section and that meets the requirements of subsection (b)(3) of
      this section if a presubmission conference is requested by the
      applicant;
        (D) a bioequivalence study; or
        (E) an in vitro study;

    by experts qualified by scientific training and experience to
    evaluate the effectiveness of the drug involved, on the basis of
    which it could fairly and reasonably be concluded by such experts
    that the drug will have the effect it purports or is represented to
    have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or
    suggested in the labeling or proposed labeling thereof.
      (4) In a case in which an animal drug contains more than one
    active ingredient, or the labeling of the drug prescribes,
    recommends, or suggests use of the drug in combination with one or
    more other animal drugs, and the active ingredients or drugs
    intended for use in the combination have previously been separately
    approved pursuant to an application submitted under subsection
    (b)(1) of this section for particular uses and conditions of use
    for which they are intended for use in the combination - 
        (A) the Secretary shall not issue an order under paragraph
      (1)(A), (1)(B), or (1)(D) refusing to approve the application for
      such combination on human food safety grounds unless the
      Secretary finds that the application fails to establish that - 
          (i) none of the active ingredients or drugs intended for use
        in the combination, respectively, at the longest withdrawal
        time of any of the active ingredients or drugs in the
        combination, respectively, exceeds its established tolerance;
        or
          (ii) none of the active ingredients or drugs in the
        combination interferes with the methods of analysis for another
        of the active ingredients or drugs in the combination,
        respectively;

        (B) the Secretary shall not issue an order under paragraph
      (1)(A), (1)(B), or (1)(D) refusing to approve the application for
      such combination on target animal safety grounds unless the
      Secretary finds that - 
          (i)(I) there is a substantiated scientific issue, specific to
        one or more of the active ingredients or animal drugs in the
        combination, that cannot adequately be evaluated based on
        information contained in the application for the combination
        (including any investigations, studies, or tests for which the
        applicant has a right of reference or use from the person by or
        for whom the investigations, studies, or tests were conducted);
        or
          (II) there is a scientific issue raised by target animal
        observations contained in studies submitted to the Secretary as
        part of the application; and
          (ii) based on the Secretary's evaluation of the information
        contained in the application with respect to the issues
        identified in clauses (i)(I) and (II), paragraph (1)(A), (B),
        or (D) apply;

        (C) except in the case of a combination that contains a
      nontopical antibacterial ingredient or animal drug, the Secretary
      shall not issue an order under paragraph (1)(E) refusing to
      approve an application for a combination animal drug intended for
      use other than in animal feed or drinking water unless the
      Secretary finds that the application fails to demonstrate that - 
          (i) there is substantial evidence that any active ingredient
        or animal drug intended only for the same use as another active
        ingredient or animal drug in the combination makes a
        contribution to labeled effectiveness;
          (ii) each active ingredient or animal drug intended for at
        least one use that is different from all other active
        ingredients or animal drugs used in the combination provides
        appropriate concurrent use for the intended target population;
        or
          (iii) where based on scientific information the Secretary has
        reason to believe the active ingredients or animal drugs may be
        physically incompatible or have disparate dosing regimens, such
        active ingredients or animal drugs are physically compatible or
        do not have disparate dosing regimens; and

        (D) the Secretary shall not issue an order under paragraph
      (1)(E) refusing to approve an application for a combination
      animal drug intended for use in animal feed or drinking water
      unless the Secretary finds that the application fails to
      demonstrate that - 
          (i) there is substantial evidence that any active ingredient
        or animal drug intended only for the same use as another active
        ingredient or animal drug in the combination makes a
        contribution to the labeled effectiveness;
          (ii) each of the active ingredients or animal drugs intended
        for at least one use that is different from all other active
        ingredients or animal drugs used in the combination provides
        appropriate concurrent use for the intended target population;
          (iii) where a combination contains more than one nontopical
        antibacterial ingredient or animal drug, there is substantial
        evidence that each of the nontopical antibacterial ingredients
        or animal drugs makes a contribution to the labeled
        effectiveness, except that for purposes of this clause,
        antibacterial ingredient or animal drug does not include the
        ionophore or arsenical classes of animal drugs; or
          (iv) where based on scientific information the Secretary has
        reason to believe the active ingredients or animal drugs
        intended for use in drinking water may be physically
        incompatible, such active ingredients or animal drugs intended
        for use in drinking water are physically compatible.

      (5) In reviewing an application that proposes a change to add an
    intended use for a minor use or a minor species to an approved new
    animal drug application, the Secretary shall reevaluate only the
    relevant information in the approved application to determine
    whether the application for the minor use or minor species can be
    approved. A decision to approve the application for the minor use
    or minor species is not, implicitly or explicitly, a reaffirmation
    of the approval of the original application.
    (e) Withdrawal of approval; grounds; immediate suspension upon
      finding imminent hazard to health of man or animals
      (1) The Secretary shall, after due notice and opportunity for
    hearing to the applicant, issue an order withdrawing approval of an
    application filed pursuant to subsection (b) of this section with
    respect to any new animal drug if the Secretary finds - 
        (A) that experience or scientific data show that such drug is
      unsafe for use under the conditions of use upon the basis of
      which the application was approved or the condition of use
      authorized under subsection (a)(4)(A) of this section;
        (B) that new evidence not contained in such application or not
      available to the Secretary until after such application was
      approved, or tests by new methods, or tests by methods not deemed
      reasonably applicable when such application was approved,
      evaluated together with the evidence available to the Secretary
      when the application was approved, shows that such drug is not
      shown to be safe for use under the conditions of use upon the
      basis of which the application was approved or that subparagraph
      (I) of paragraph (1) of subsection (d) of this section applies to
      such drug;
        (C) on the basis of new information before him with respect to
      such drug, evaluated together with the evidence available to him
      when the application was approved, that there is a lack of
      substantial evidence that such drug will have the effect it
      purports or is represented to have under the conditions of use
      prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling thereof;
        (D) the patent information prescribed by subsection (c)(3) of
      this section was not filed within 30 days after the receipt of
      written notice from the Secretary specifying the failure to file
      such information;
        (E) that the application contains any untrue statement of a
      material fact; or
        (F) that the applicant has made any changes from the standpoint
      of safety or effectiveness beyond the variations provided for in
      the application unless he has supplemented the application by
      filing with the Secretary adequate information respecting all
      such changes and unless there is in effect an approval of the
      supplemental application. The supplemental application shall be
      treated in the same manner as the original application.

    If the Secretary (or in his absence the officer acting as
    Secretary) finds that there is an imminent hazard to the health of
    man or of the animals for which such drug is intended, he may
    suspend the approval of such application immediately, and give the
    applicant prompt notice of his action and afford the applicant the
    opportunity for an expedited hearing under this subsection; but the
    authority conferred by this sentence to suspend the approval of an
    application shall not be delegated.
      (2) The Secretary may also, after due notice and opportunity for
    hearing to the applicant, issue an order withdrawing the approval
    of an application with respect to any new animal drug under this
    section if the Secretary finds - 
        (A) that the applicant has failed to establish a system for
      maintaining required records, or has repeatedly or deliberately
      failed to maintain such records or to make required reports in
      accordance with a regulation or order under subsection (1) of
      this section, or the applicant has refused to permit access to,
      or copying or verification of, such records as required by
      paragraph (2) of such subsection;
        (B) that on the basis of new information before him, evaluated
      together with the evidence before him when the application was
      approved, the methods used in, or the facilities and controls
      used for, the manufacture, processing, and packing of such drug
      are inadequate to assure and preserve its identity, strength,
      quality, and purity and were not made adequate within a
      reasonable time after receipt of written notice from the
      Secretary specifying the matter complained of; or
        (C) that on the basis of new information before him, evaluated
      together with the evidence before him when the application was
      approved, the labeling of such drug, based on a fair evaluation
      of all material facts, is false or misleading in any particular
      and was not corrected within a reasonable time after receipt of
      written notice from the Secretary specifying the matter
      complained of.

      (3) Any order under this subsection shall state the findings upon
    which it is based.
    (f) Revocation of order refusing, withdrawing or suspending
      approval of application
      Whenever the Secretary finds that the facts so require, he shall
    revoke any previous order under subsection (d), (e), or (m) of this
    section, or section 360ccc(c), (d), or (e) of this title refusing,
    withdrawing, or suspending approval of an application and shall
    approve such application or reinstate such approval, as may be
    appropriate.
    (g) Service of orders
      Orders of the Secretary issued under this section, or section
    360ccc of this title (other than orders issuing, amending, or
    repealing regulations) shall be served (1) in person by any officer
    or employee of the department designated by the Secretary or (2) by
    mailing the order by registered mail or by certified mail addressed
    to the applicant or respondent at his last known address in the
    records of the Secretary.
    (h) Appeal from order
      An appeal may be taken by the applicant from an order of the
    Secretary refusing or withdrawing approval of an application filed
    under subsection (b) or (m) of this section. The provisions of
    subsection (h) of section 355 of this title shall govern any such
    appeal.
    (i) Publication in Federal Register; effective date and revocation
      or suspension of regulation
      When a new animal drug application filed pursuant to subsection
    (b) of this section or section 360ccc of this title is approved,
    the Secretary shall by notice, which upon publication shall be
    effective as a regulation, publish in the Federal Register the name
    and address of the applicant and the conditions and indications of
    use of the new animal drug covered by such application, including
    any tolerance and withdrawal period or other use restrictions and,
    if such new animal drug is intended for use in animal feed,
    appropriate purposes and conditions of use (including special
    labeling requirements and any requirement that an animal feed
    bearing or containing the new animal drug be limited to use under
    the professional supervision of a licensed veterinarian) applicable
    to any animal feed for use in which such drug is approved, and such
    other information, upon the basis of which such application was
    approved, as the Secretary deems necessary to assure the safe and
    effective use of such drug. Upon withdrawal of approval of such new
    animal drug application or upon its suspension or upon failure to
    renew a conditional approval under section 360ccc of this title,
    the Secretary shall forthwith revoke or suspend, as the case may
    be, the regulation published pursuant to this subsection (i)
    insofar as it is based on the approval of such application.
    (j) Exemption of drugs for research; discretionary and mandatory
      conditions
      To the extent consistent with the public health, the Secretary
    shall promulgate regulations for exempting from the operation of
    this section new animal drugs, and animal feeds bearing or
    containing new animal drugs, intended solely for investigational
    use by experts qualified by scientific training and experience to
    investigate the safety and effectiveness of animal drugs. Such
    regulations may, in the discretion of the Secretary, among other
    conditions relating to the protection of the public health, provide
    for conditioning such exemption upon the establishment and
    maintenance of such records, and the making of such reports to the
    Secretary, by the manufacturer or the sponsor of the investigation
    of such article, of data (including but not limited to analytical
    reports by investigators) obtained as a result of such
    investigational use of such article, as the Secretary finds will
    enable him to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of such article
    in the event of the filing of an application pursuant to this
    section. Such regulations, among other things, shall set forth the
    conditions (if any) upon which animals treated with such articles,
    and any products of such animals (before or after slaughter), may
    be marketed for food use.
    (k) Food containing new animal drug considered unadulterated while
      approval of application for such drug is effective
      While approval of an application for a new animal drug is
    effective, a food shall not, by reason of bearing or containing
    such drug or any substance formed in or on the food because of its
    use in accordance with such application (including the conditions
    and indications of use prescribed pursuant to subsection (i) of
    this section), be considered adulterated within the meaning of
    clause (1) of section 342(a) of this title.
    (l) Records and reports; required information; regulations and
      orders; examination of data; access to records
      (1) In the case of any new animal drug for which an approval of
    an application filed pursuant to subsection (b) of this section or
    section 360ccc of this title is in effect, the applicant shall
    establish and maintain such records, and make such reports to the
    Secretary, of data relating to experience, including experience
    with uses authorized under subsection (a)(4)(A) of this section,
    and other data or information, received or otherwise obtained by
    such applicant with respect to such drug, or with respect to animal
    feeds bearing or containing such drug, as the Secretary may by
    general regulation, or by order with respect to such application,
    prescribe on the basis of a finding that such records and reports
    are necessary in order to enable the Secretary to determine, or
    facilitate a determination, whether there is or may be ground for
    invoking subsection (e) or subsection (m)(4) of this section. Such
    regulation or order shall provide, where the Secretary deems it to
    be appropriate, for the examination, upon request, by the persons
    to whom such regulation or order is applicable, of similar
    information received or otherwise obtained by the Secretary.
      (2) Every person required under this subsection to maintain
    records, and every person in charge or custody thereof, shall, upon
    request of an officer or employee designated by the Secretary,
    permit such officer or employee at all reasonable times to have
    access to and copy and verify such records.
    (m) Feed mill licenses
      (1) Any person may file with the Secretary an application for a
    license to manufacture animal feeds bearing or containing new
    animal drugs. Such person shall submit to the Secretary as part of
    the application (A) a full statement of the business name and
    address of the specific facility at which the manufacturing is to
    take place and the facility's registration number, (B) the name and
    signature of the responsible individual or individuals for that
    facility, (C) a certification that the animal feeds bearing or
    containing new animal drugs are manufactured and labeled in
    accordance with the applicable regulations published pursuant to
    subsection (i) of this section or for indexed new animal drugs in
    accordance with the index listing published pursuant to section
    360ccc-1(e)(2) of this title and the labeling requirements set
    forth in section 360ccc-1(h) of this title, and (D) a certification
    that the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for,
    manufacturing, processing, packaging, and holding such animal feeds
    are in conformity with current good manufacturing practice as
    described in section 351(a)(2)(B) of this title.
      (2) Within 90 days after the filing of an application pursuant to
    paragraph (1), or such additional period as may be agreed upon by
    the Secretary and the applicant, the Secretary shall (A) issue an
    order approving the application if the Secretary then finds that
    none of the grounds for denying approval specified in paragraph (3)
    applies, or (B) give the applicant notice of an opportunity for a
    hearing before the Secretary under paragraph (3) on the question
    whether such application is approvable. The procedure governing
    such a hearing shall be the procedure set forth in the last two
    sentences of subsection (c)(1) of this section.
      (3) If the Secretary, after due notice to the applicant in
    accordance with paragraph (2) and giving the applicant an
    opportunity for a hearing in accordance with such paragraph, finds,
    on the basis of information submitted to the Secretary as part of
    the application, on the basis of a preapproval inspection, or on
    the basis of any other information before the Secretary - 
        (A) that the application is incomplete, false, or misleading in
      any particular;
        (B) that the methods used in, and the facilities and controls
      used for, the manufacture, processing, and packing of such animal
      feed are inadequate to preserve the identity, strength, quality,
      and purity of the new animal drug therein; or
        (C) that the facility manufactures animal feeds bearing or
      containing new animal drugs in a manner that does not accord with
      the specifications for manufacture or labels animal feeds bearing
      or containing new animal drugs in a manner that does not accord
      with the conditions or indications of use that are published
      pursuant to subsection (i) of this section or an index listing
      pursuant to section 360ccc-1(e) of this title,

    the Secretary shall issue an order refusing to approve the
    application. If, after such notice and opportunity for hearing, the
    Secretary finds that subparagraphs (A) through (C) do not apply,
    the Secretary shall issue an order approving the application. An
    order under this subsection approving an application for a license
    to manufacture animal feeds bearing or containing new animal drugs
    shall permit a facility to manufacture only those animal feeds
    bearing or containing new animal drugs for which there are in
    effect regulations pursuant to subsection (i) of this section or an
    index listing pursuant to section 360ccc-1(e) of this title
    relating to the use of such drugs in or on such animal feed.
      (4)(A) The Secretary shall, after due notice and opportunity for
    hearing to the applicant, revoke a license to manufacture animal
    feeds bearing or containing new animal drugs under this subsection
    if the Secretary finds - 
        (i) that the application for such license contains any untrue
      statement of a material fact; or
        (ii) that the applicant has made changes that would cause the
      application to contain any untrue statements of material fact or
      that would affect the safety or effectiveness of the animal feeds
      manufactured at the facility unless the applicant has
      supplemented the application by filing with the Secretary
      adequate information respecting all such changes and unless there
      is in effect an approval of the supplemental application.

    If the Secretary (or in the Secretary's absence the officer acting
    as the Secretary) finds that there is an imminent hazard to the
    health of humans or of the animals for which such animal feed is
    intended, the Secretary may suspend the license immediately, and
    give the applicant prompt notice of the action and afford the
    applicant the opportunity for an expedited hearing under this
    subsection; but the authority conferred by this sentence shall not
    be delegated.
      (B) The Secretary may also, after due notice and opportunity for
    hearing to the applicant, revoke a license to manufacture animal
    feed under this subsection if the Secretary finds - 
        (i) that the applicant has failed to establish a system for
      maintaining required records, or has repeatedly or deliberately
      failed to maintain such records or to make required reports in
      accordance with a regulation or order under paragraph (5)(A) of
      this subsection or section 354(a)(3)(A) of this title, or the
      applicant has refused to permit access to, or copying or
      verification of, such records as required by subparagraph (B) of
      such paragraph or section 354(a)(3)(B) of this title;
        (ii) that on the basis of new information before the Secretary,
      evaluated together with the evidence before the Secretary when
      such license was issued, the methods used in, or the facilities
      and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, packing, and
      holding of such animal feed are inadequate to assure and preserve
      the identity, strength, quality, and purity of the new animal
      drug therein, and were not made adequate within a reasonable time
      after receipt of written notice from the Secretary, specifying
      the matter complained of;
        (iii) that on the basis of new information before the
      Secretary, evaluated together with the evidence before the
      Secretary when such license was issued, the labeling of any
      animal feeds, based on a fair evaluation of all material facts,
      is false or misleading in any particular and was not corrected
      within a reasonable time after receipt of written notice from the
      Secretary specifying the matter complained of; or
        (iv) that on the basis of new information before the Secretary,
      evaluated together with the evidence before the Secretary when
      such license was issued, the facility has manufactured,
      processed, packed, or held animal feed bearing or containing a
      new animal drug adulterated under section 351(a)(6) of this title
      and the facility did not discontinue the manufacture, processing,
      packing, or holding of such animal feed within a reasonable time
      after receipt of written notice from the Secretary specifying the
      matter complained of.

      (C) The Secretary may also revoke a license to manufacture animal
    feeds under this subsection if an applicant gives notice to the
    Secretary of intention to discontinue the manufacture of all animal
    feed covered under this subsection and waives an opportunity for a
    hearing on the matter.
      (D) Any order under this paragraph shall state the findings upon
    which it is based.
      (5) When a license to manufacture animal feeds bearing or
    containing new animal drugs has been issued - 
        (A) the applicant shall establish and maintain such records,
      and make such reports to the Secretary, or (at the option of the
      Secretary) to the appropriate person or persons holding an
      approved application filed under subsection (b) of this section,
      as the Secretary may by general regulation, or by order with
      respect to such application, prescribe on the basis of a finding
      that such records and reports are necessary in order to enable
      the Secretary to determine, or facilitate a determination,
      whether there is or may be ground for invoking subsection (e) of
      this section or paragraph (4); and
        (B) every person required under this subsection to maintain
      records, and every person in charge or custody thereof, shall,
      upon request of an officer or employee designated by the
      Secretary, permit such officer or employee at all reasonable
      times to have access to and copy and verify such records.

      (6) To the extent consistent with the public health, the
    Secretary may promulgate regulations for exempting from the
    operation of this subsection facilities that manufacture, process,
    pack, or hold animal feeds bearing or containing new animal drugs.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 360c. Classification of devices intended for human use

-STATUTE-
    (a) Classes of devices
      (1) There are established the following classes of devices
    intended for human use:
        (A) Class I, General Controls. - 
          (i) A device for which the controls authorized by or under
        section 351, 352, 360, 360f, 360h, 360i, or 360j of this title
        or any combination of such sections are sufficient to provide
        reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the
        device.
          (ii) A device for which insufficient information exists to
        determine that the controls referred to in clause (i) are
        sufficient to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and
        effectiveness of the device or to establish special controls to
        provide such assurance, but because it - 
            (I) is not purported or represented to be for a use in
          supporting or sustaining human life or for a use which is of
          substantial importance in preventing impairment of human
          health, and
            (II) does not present a potential unreasonable risk of
          illness or injury,

        is to be regulated by the controls referred to in clause (i).

        (B) Class II, Special Controls. - A device which cannot be
      classified as a class I device because the general controls by
      themselves are insufficient to provide reasonable assurance of
      the safety and effectiveness of the device, and for which there
      is sufficient information to establish special controls to
      provide such assurance, including the promulgation of performance
      standards, postmarket surveillance, patient registries,
      development and dissemination of guidelines (including guidelines
      for the submission of clinical data in premarket notification
      submissions in accordance with section 360(k) of this title),
      recommendations, and other appropriate actions as the Secretary
      deems necessary to provide such assurance. For a device that is
      purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or
      sustaining human life, the Secretary shall examine and identify
      the special controls, if any, that are necessary to provide
      adequate assurance of safety and effectiveness and describe how
      such controls provide such assurance.
        (C) Class III, Premarket Approval. - A device which because - 
          (i) it (I) cannot be classified as a class I device because
        insufficient information exists to determine that the
        application of general controls are sufficient to provide
        reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the
        device, and (II) cannot be classified as a class II device
        because insufficient information exists to determine that the
        special controls described in subparagraph (B) would provide
        reasonable assurance of its safety and effectiveness, and
          (ii)(I) is purported or represented to be for a use in
        supporting or sustaining human life or for a use which is of
        substantial importance in preventing impairment of human
        health, or
          (II) presents a potential unreasonable risk of illness or
        injury,

      is to be subject, in accordance with section 360e of this title,
      to premarket approval to provide reasonable assurance of its
      safety and effectiveness.

    If there is not sufficient information to establish a performance
    standard for a device to provide reasonable assurance of its safety
    and effectiveness, the Secretary may conduct such activities as may
    be necessary to develop or obtain such information.
      (2) For purposes of this section and sections 360d and 360e of
    this title, the safety and effectiveness of a device are to be
    determined - 
        (A) with respect to the persons for whose use the device is
      represented or intended,
        (B) with respect to the conditions of use prescribed,
      recommended, or suggested in the labeling of the device, and
        (C) weighing any probable benefit to health from the use of the
      device against any probable risk of injury or illness from such
      use.

      (3)(A) Except as authorized by subparagraph (B), the
    effectiveness of a device is, for purposes of this section and
    sections 360d and 360e of this title, to be determined, in
    accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary, on the
    basis of well-controlled investigations, including 1 or more
    clinical investigations where appropriate, by experts qualified by
    training and experience to evaluate the effectiveness of the
    device, from which investigations it can fairly and responsibly be
    concluded by qualified experts that the device will have the effect
    it purports or is represented to have under the conditions of use
    prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling of the
    device.
      (B) If the Secretary determines that there exists valid
    scientific evidence (other than evidence derived from
    investigations described in subparagraph (A)) - 
        (i) which is sufficient to determine the effectiveness of a
      device, and
        (ii) from which it can fairly and responsibly be concluded by
      qualified experts that the device will have the effect it
      purports or is represented to have under the conditions of use
      prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling of the
      device,

    then, for purposes of this section and sections 360d and 360e of
    this title, the Secretary may authorize the effectiveness of the
    device to be determined on the basis of such evidence.
      (C) In making a determination of a reasonable assurance of the
    effectiveness of a device for which an application under section
    360e of this title has been submitted, the Secretary shall consider
    whether the extent of data that otherwise would be required for
    approval of the application with respect to effectiveness can be
    reduced through reliance on postmarket controls.
      (D)(i) The Secretary, upon the written request of any person
    intending to submit an application under section 360e of this
    title, shall meet with such person to determine the type of valid
    scientific evidence (within the meaning of subparagraphs (A) and
    (B)) that will be necessary to demonstrate for purposes of approval
    of an application the effectiveness of a device for the conditions
    of use proposed by such person. The written request shall include a
    detailed description of the device, a detailed description of the
    proposed conditions of use of the device, a proposed plan for
    determining whether there is a reasonable assurance of
    effectiveness, and, if available, information regarding the
    expected performance from the device. Within 30 days after such
    meeting, the Secretary shall specify in writing the type of valid
    scientific evidence that will provide a reasonable assurance that a
    device is effective under the conditions of use proposed by such
    person.
      (ii) Any clinical data, including one or more well-controlled
    investigations, specified in writing by the Secretary for
    demonstrating a reasonable assurance of device effectiveness shall
    be specified as result of a determination by the Secretary that
    such data are necessary to establish device effectiveness. The
    Secretary shall consider, in consultation with the applicant, the
    least burdensome appropriate means of evaluating device
    effectiveness that would have a reasonable likelihood of resulting
    in approval.
      (iii) The determination of the Secretary with respect to the
    specification of valid scientific evidence under clauses (i) and
    (ii) shall be binding upon the Secretary, unless such determination
    by the Secretary could be contrary to the public health.
    (b) Classification panels
      (1) For purposes of - 
        (A) determining which devices intended for human use should be
      subject to the requirements of general controls, performance
      standards, or premarket approval, and
        (B) providing notice to the manufacturers and importers of such
      devices to enable them to prepare for the application of such
      requirements to devices manufactured or imported by them,

    the Secretary shall classify all such devices (other than devices
    classified by subsection (f) of this section) into the classes
    established by subsection (a) of this section. For the purpose of
    securing recommendations with respect to the classification of
    devices, the Secretary shall establish panels of experts or use
    panels of experts established before May 28, 1976, or both. Section
    14 of the Federal Advisory Committee Act shall not apply to the
    duration of a panel established under this paragraph.
      (2) The Secretary shall appoint to each panel established under
    paragraph (1) persons who are qualified by training and experience
    to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the devices to be
    referred to the panel and who, to the extent feasible, possess
    skill in the use of, or experience in the development, manufacture,
    or utilization of, such devices. The Secretary shall make
    appointments to each panel so that each panel shall consist of
    members with adequately diversified expertise in such fields as
    clinical and administrative medicine, engineering, biological and
    physical sciences, and other related professions. In addition, each
    panel shall include as nonvoting members a representative of
    consumer interests and a representative of interests of the device
    manufacturing industry. Scientific, trade, and consumer
    organizations shall be afforded an opportunity to nominate
    individuals for appointment to the panels. No individual who is in
    the regular full-time employ of the United States and engaged in
    the administration of this chapter may be a member of any panel.
    The Secretary shall designate one of the members of each panel to
    serve as chairman thereof.
      (3) Panel members (other than officers or employees of the United
    States), while attending meetings or conferences of a panel or
    otherwise engaged in its business, shall be entitled to receive
    compensation at rates to be fixed by the Secretary, but not at
    rates exceeding the daily equivalent of the rate in effect for
    grade GS-18 of the General Schedule, for each day so engaged,
    including traveltime; and while so serving away from their homes or
    regular places of business each member may be allowed travel
    expenses (including per diem in lieu of subsistence) as authorized
    by section 5703 of title 5, for persons in the Government service
    employed intermittently.
      (4) The Secretary shall furnish each panel with adequate clerical
    and other necessary assistance.
      (5) Classification panels covering each type of device shall be
    scheduled to meet at such times as may be appropriate for the
    Secretary to meet applicable statutory deadlines.
      (6)(A) Any person whose device is specifically the subject of
    review by a classification panel shall have - 
        (i) the same access to data and information submitted to a
      classification panel (except for data and information that are
      not available for public disclosure under section 552 of title 5)
      as the Secretary;
        (ii) the opportunity to submit, for review by a classification
      panel, information that is based on the data or information
      provided in the application submitted under section 360e of this
      title by the person, which information shall be submitted to the
      Secretary for prompt transmittal to the classification panel; and
        (iii) the same opportunity as the Secretary to participate in
      meetings of the panel.

      (B) Any meetings of a classification panel shall provide adequate
    time for initial presentations and for response to any differing
    views by persons whose devices are specifically the subject of a
    classification panel review, and shall encourage free and open
    participation by all interested persons.
      (7) After receiving from a classification panel the conclusions
    and recommendations of the panel on a matter that the panel has
    reviewed, the Secretary shall review the conclusions and
    recommendations, shall make a final decision on the matter in
    accordance with section 360e(d)(2) of this title, and shall notify
    the affected persons of the decision in writing and, if the
    decision differs from the conclusions and recommendations of the
    panel, shall include the reasons for the difference.
      (8) A classification panel under this subsection shall not be
    subject to the annual chartering and annual report requirements of
    the Federal Advisory Committee Act.
    (c) Classification panel organization and operation
      (1) The Secretary shall organize the panels according to the
    various fields of clinical medicine and fundamental sciences in
    which devices intended for human use are used. The Secretary shall
    refer a device to be classified under this section to an
    appropriate panel established or authorized to be used under
    subsection (b) of this section for its review and for its
    recommendation respecting the classification of the device. The
    Secretary shall by regulation prescribe the procedure to be
    followed by the panels in making their reviews and recommendations.
    In making their reviews of devices, the panels, to the maximum
    extent practicable, shall provide an opportunity for interested
    persons to submit data and views on the classification of the
    devices.
      (2)(A) Upon completion of a panel's review of a device referred
    to it under paragraph (1), the panel shall, subject to
    subparagraphs (B) and (C), submit to the Secretary its
    recommendation for the classification of the device. Any such
    recommendation shall (i) contain (I) a summary of the reasons for
    the recommendation, (II) a summary of the data upon which the
    recommendation is based, and (III) an identification of the risks
    to health (if any) presented by the device with respect to which
    the recommendation is made, and (ii) to the extent practicable,
    include a recommendation for the assignment of a priority for the
    application of the requirements of section 360d or 360e of this
    title to a device recommended to be classified in class II or class
    III.
      (B) A recommendation of a panel for the classification of a
    device in class I shall include a recommendation as to whether the
    device should be exempted from the requirements of section 360,
    360i, or 360j(f) of this title.
      (C) In the case of a device which has been referred under
    paragraph (1) to a panel, and which - 
        (i) is intended to be implanted in the human body or is
      purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or
      sustaining human life, and
        (ii)(I) has been introduced or delivered for introduction into
      interstate commerce for commercial distribution before May 28,
      1976, or
        (II) is within a type of device which was so introduced or
      delivered before such date and is substantially equivalent to
      another device within that type,

    such panel shall recommend to the Secretary that the device be
    classified in class III unless the panel determines that
    classification of the device in such class is not necessary to
    provide reasonable assurance of its safety and effectiveness. If a
    panel does not recommend that such a device be classified in class
    III, it shall in its recommendation to the Secretary for the
    classification of the device set forth the reasons for not
    recommending classification of the device in such class.
      (3) The panels shall submit to the Secretary within one year of
    the date funds are first appropriated for the implementation of
    this section their recommendations respecting all devices of a type
    introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce
    for commercial distribution before May 28, 1976.
    (d) Panel recommendation; publication; priorities
      (1) Upon receipt of a recommendation from a panel respecting a
    device, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register the
    panel's recommendation and a proposed regulation classifying such
    device and shall provide interested persons an opportunity to
    submit comments on such recommendation and the proposed regulation.
    After reviewing such comments, the Secretary shall, subject to
    paragraph (2), by regulation classify such device.
      (2)(A) A regulation under paragraph (1) classifying a device in
    class I shall prescribe which, if any, of the requirements of
    section 360, 360i, or 360j(f) of this title shall not apply to the
    device. A regulation which makes a requirement of section 360,
    360i, or 360j(f) of this title inapplicable to a device shall be
    accompanied by a statement of the reasons of the Secretary for
    making such requirement inapplicable.
      (B) A device described in subsection (c)(2)(C) of this section
    shall be classified in class III unless the Secretary determines
    that classification of the device in such class is not necessary to
    provide reasonable assurance of its safety and effectiveness. A
    proposed regulation under paragraph (1) classifying such a device
    in a class other than class III shall be accompanied by a full
    statement of the reasons of the Secretary (and supporting
    documentation and data) for not classifying such device in such
    class and an identification of the risks to health (if any)
    presented by such device.
      (3) In the case of devices classified in class II and devices
    classified under this subsection in class III and described in
    section 360e(b)(1) of this title the Secretary may establish
    priorities which, in his discretion, shall be used in applying
    sections 360d and 360e of this title, as appropriate, to such
    devices.
    (e) Classification changes
      (1) Based on new information respecting a device, the Secretary
    may, upon his own initiative or upon petition of an interested
    person, by regulation (A) change such device's classification, and
    (B) revoke, because of the change in classification, any regulation
    or requirement in effect under section 360d or 360e of this title
    with respect to such device. In the promulgation of such a
    regulation respecting a device's classification, the Secretary may
    secure from the panel to which the device was last referred
    pursuant to subsection (c) of this section a recommendation
    respecting the proposed change in the device's classification and
    shall publish in the Federal Register any recommendation submitted
    to the Secretary by the panel respecting such change. A regulation
    under this subsection changing the classification of a device from
    class III to class II may provide that such classification shall
    not take effect until the effective date of a performance standard
    established under section 360d of this title for such device.
      (2) By regulation promulgated under paragraph (1), the Secretary
    may change the classification of a device from class III - 
        (A) to class II if the Secretary determines that special
      controls would provide reasonable assurance of the safety and
      effectiveness of the device and that general controls would not
      provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of
      the device, or
        (B) to class I if the Secretary determines that general
      controls would provide reasonable assurance of the safety and
      effectiveness of the device.
    (f) Initial classification and reclassification of certain devices
      (1) Any device intended for human use which was not introduced or
    delivered for introduction into interstate commerce for commercial
    distribution before May 28, 1976, is classified in class III unless
    - 
        (A) the device - 
          (i) is within a type of device (I) which was introduced or
        delivered for introduction into interstate commerce for
        commercial distribution before such date and which is to be
        classified pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, or (II)
        which was not so introduced or delivered before such date and
        has been classified in class I or II, and
          (ii) is substantially equivalent to another device within
        such type, or

        (B) the Secretary in response to a petition submitted under
      paragraph (3) has classified such device in class I or II.

    A device classified in class III under this paragraph shall be
    classified in that class until the effective date of an order of
    the Secretary under paragraph (2) or (3) classifying the device in
    class I or II.
      (2)(A) Any person who submits a report under section 360(k) of
    this title for a type of device that has not been previously
    classified under this chapter, and that is classified into class
    III under paragraph (1), may request, within 30 days after
    receiving written notice of such a classification, the Secretary to
    classify the device under the criteria set forth in subparagraphs
    (A) through (C) of subsection (a)(1) of this section. The person
    may, in the request, recommend to the Secretary a classification
    for the device. Any such request shall describe the device and
    provide detailed information and reasons for the recommended
    classification.
      (B)(i) Not later than 60 days after the date of the submission of
    the request under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall by written
    order classify the device involved. Such classification shall be
    the initial classification of the device for purposes of paragraph
    (1) and any device classified under this paragraph shall be a
    predicate device for determining substantial equivalence under
    paragraph (1).
      (ii) A device that remains in class III under this subparagraph
    shall be deemed to be adulterated within the meaning of section
    351(f)(1)(B) of this title until approved under section 360e of
    this title or exempted from such approval under section 360j(g) of
    this title.
      (C) Within 30 days after the issuance of an order classifying a
    device under this paragraph, the Secretary shall publish a notice
    in the Federal Register announcing such classification.
      (3)(A) The Secretary may initiate the reclassification of a
    device classified into class III under paragraph (1) of this
    subsection or the manufacturer or importer of a device classified
    under paragraph (1) may petition the Secretary (in such form and
    manner as he shall prescribe) for the issuance of an order
    classifying the device in class I or class II. Within thirty days
    of the filing of such a petition, the Secretary shall notify the
    petitioner of any deficiencies in the petition which prevent the
    Secretary from making a decision on the petition.
      (B)(i) Upon determining that a petition does not contain any
    deficiency which prevents the Secretary from making a decision on
    the petition, the Secretary may for good cause shown refer the
    petition to an appropriate panel established or authorized to be
    used under subsection (b) of this section. A panel to which such a
    petition has been referred shall not later than ninety days after
    the referral of the petition make a recommendation to the Secretary
    respecting approval or denial of the petition. Any such
    recommendation shall contain (I) a summary of the reasons for the
    recommendation, (II) a summary of the data upon which the
    recommendation is based, and (III) an identification of the risks
    to health (if any) presented by the device with respect to which
    the petition was filed. In the case of a petition for a device
    which is intended to be implanted in the human body or which is
    purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or
    sustaining human life, the panel shall recommend that the petition
    be denied unless the panel determines that the classification in
    class III of the device is not necessary to provide reasonable
    assurance of its safety and effectiveness. If the panel recommends
    that such petition be approved, it shall in its recommendation to
    the Secretary set forth its reasons for such recommendation.
      (ii) The requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (c)
    of this section (relating to opportunities for submission of data
    and views and recommendations respecting priorities and exemptions
    from sections 360, 360i, and 360j(f) of this title) shall apply
    with respect to consideration by panels of petitions submitted
    under subparagraph (A).
      (C)(i) Within ninety days from the date the Secretary receives
    the recommendation of a panel respecting a petition (but not later
    than 210 days after the filing of such petition) the Secretary
    shall by order deny or approve the petition. If the Secretary
    approves the petition, the Secretary shall order the classification
    of the device into class I or class II in accordance with the
    criteria prescribed by subsection (a)(1)(A) or (a)(1)(B) of this
    section. In the case of a petition for a device which is intended
    to be implanted in the human body or which is purported or
    represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life,
    the Secretary shall deny the petition unless the Secretary
    determines that the classification in class III of the device is
    not necessary to provide reasonable assurance of its safety and
    effectiveness. An order approving such petition shall be
    accompanied by a full statement of the reasons of the Secretary
    (and supporting documentation and data) for approving the petition
    and an identification of the risks to health (if any) presented by
    the device to which such order applies.
      (ii) The requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2)(A) of subsection
    (d) of this section (relating to publication of recommendations,
    opportunity for submission of comments, and exemption from sections
    360, 360i, and 360j(f) of this title) shall apply with respect to
    action by the Secretary on petitions submitted under subparagraph
    (A).
      (4) If a manufacturer reports to the Secretary under section
    360(k) of this title that a device is substantially equivalent to
    another device - 
        (A) which the Secretary has classified as a class III device
      under subsection (b) of this section,
        (B) which was introduced or delivered for introduction into
      interstate commerce for commercial distribution before December
      1, 1990, and
        (C) for which no final regulation requiring premarket approval
      has been promulgated under section 360e(b) of this title,

    the manufacturer shall certify to the Secretary that the
    manufacturer has conducted a reasonable search of all information
    known or otherwise available to the manufacturer respecting such
    other device and has included in the report under section 360(k) of
    this title a summary of and a citation to all adverse safety and
    effectiveness data respecting such other device and respecting the
    device for which the section 360(k) report is being made and which
    has not been submitted to the Secretary under section 360i of this
    title. The Secretary may require the manufacturer to submit the
    adverse safety and effectiveness data described in the report.
      (5) The Secretary may not withhold a determination of the initial
    classification of a device under paragraph (1) because of a failure
    to comply with any provision of this chapter unrelated to a
    substantial equivalence decision, including a finding that the
    facility in which the device is manufactured is not in compliance
    with good manufacturing requirements as set forth in regulations of
    the Secretary under section 360j(f) of this title (other than a
    finding that there is a substantial likelihood that the failure to
    comply with such regulations will potentially present a serious
    risk to human health).
    (g) Information
      Within sixty days of the receipt of a written request of any
    person for information respecting the class in which a device has
    been classified or the requirements applicable to a device under
    this chapter, the Secretary shall provide such person a written
    statement of the classification (if any) of such device and the
    requirements of this chapter applicable to the device.
    (h) Definitions
      For purposes of this section and sections 351, 360, 360d, 360e,
    360f, 360i, and 360j of this title
        (1) a reference to "general controls" is a reference to the
      controls authorized by or under sections 351, 352, 360, 360f,
      360h, 360i, and 360j of this title,
        (2) a reference to "class I", "class II", or "class III" is a
      reference to a class of medical devices described in subparagraph
      (A), (B), or (C) of subsection (a)(1) of this section, and
        (3) a reference to a "panel under section 360c of this title"
      is a reference to a panel established or authorized to be used
      under this section.
    (i) Substantial equivalence
      (1)(A) For purposes of determinations of substantial equivalence
    under subsection (f) of this section and section 360j(l) of this
    title, the term "substantially equivalent" or "substantial
    equivalence" means, with respect to a device being compared to a
    predicate device, that the device has the same intended use as the
    predicate device and that the Secretary by order has found that the
    device - 
        (i) has the same technological characteristics as the predicate
      device, or
        (ii)(I) has different technological characteristics and the
      information submitted that the device is substantially equivalent
      to the predicate device contains information, including
      appropriate clinical or scientific data if deemed necessary by
      the Secretary or a person accredited under section 360m of this
      title, that demonstrates that the device is as safe and effective
      as a legally marketed device, and (II) does not raise different
      questions of safety and effectiveness than the predicate device.

      (B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term "different
    technological characteristics" means, with respect to a device
    being compared to a predicate device, that there is a significant
    change in the materials, design, energy source, or other features
    of the device from those of the predicate device.
      (C) To facilitate reviews of reports submitted to the Secretary
    under section 360(k) of this title, the Secretary shall consider
    the extent to which reliance on postmarket controls may expedite
    the classification of devices under subsection (f)(1) of this
    section.
      (D) Whenever the Secretary requests information to demonstrate
    that devices with differing technological characteristics are
    substantially equivalent, the Secretary shall only request
    information that is necessary to making substantial equivalence
    determinations. In making such request, the Secretary shall
    consider the least burdensome means of demonstrating substantial
    equivalence and request information accordingly.
      (E)(i) Any determination by the Secretary of the intended use of
    a device shall be based upon the proposed labeling submitted in a
    report for the device under section 360(k) of this title. However,
    when determining that a device can be found substantially
    equivalent to a legally marketed device, the director of the
    organizational unit responsible for regulating devices (in this
    subparagraph referred to as the "Director") may require a statement
    in labeling that provides appropriate information regarding a use
    of the device not identified in the proposed labeling if, after
    providing an opportunity for consultation with the person who
    submitted such report, the Director determines and states in
    writing - 
        (I) that there is a reasonable likelihood that the device will
      be used for an intended use not identified in the proposed
      labeling for the device; and
        (II) that such use could cause harm.

      (ii) Such determination shall - 
        (I) be provided to the person who submitted the report within
      10 days from the date of the notification of the Director's
      concerns regarding the proposed labeling;
        (II) specify the limitations on the use of the device not
      included in the proposed labeling; and
        (III) find the device substantially equivalent if the
      requirements of subparagraph (A) are met and if the labeling for
      such device conforms to the limitations specified in subclause
      (II).

      (iii) The responsibilities of the Director under this
    subparagraph may not be delegated.
      (F) Not later than 270 days after November 21, 1997, the
    Secretary shall issue guidance specifying the general principles
    that the Secretary will consider in determining when a specific
    intended use of a device is not reasonably included within a
    general use of such device for purposes of a determination of
    substantial equivalence under subsection (f) of this section or
    section 360j(l) of this title.
      (2) A device may not be found to be substantially equivalent to a
    predicate device that has been removed from the market at the
    initiative of the Secretary or that has been determined to be
    misbranded or adulterated by a judicial order.
      (3)(A) As part of a submission under section 360(k) of this title
    respecting a device, the person required to file a premarket
    notification under such section shall provide an adequate summary
    of any information respecting safety and effectiveness or state
    that such information will be made available upon request by any
    person.
      (B) Any summary under subparagraph (A) respecting a device shall
    contain detailed information regarding data concerning adverse
    health effects and shall be made available to the public by the
    Secretary within 30 days of the issuance of a determination that
    such device is substantially equivalent to another device.

    (a) Reasonable assurance of safe and effective performance;
      periodic evaluation
      (1) The special controls required by section 360c(a)(1)(B) of
    this title shall include performance standards for a class II
    device if the Secretary determines that a performance standard is
    necessary to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and
    effectiveness of the device. A class III device may also be
    considered a class II device for purposes of establishing a
    standard for the device under subsection (b) of this section if the
    device has been reclassified as a class II device under a
    regulation under section 360c(e) of this title but such regulation
    provides that the reclassification is not to take effect until the
    effective date of such a standard for the device.

        (C) shall, where appropriate, require the use and prescribe the
      form and content of labeling for the proper installation,
      maintenance, operation, and use of the device.

      (3) The Secretary shall provide for periodic evaluation of
    performance standards established under subsection (b) of this
    section to determine if such standards should be changed to reflect
    new medical, scientific, or other technological data.
      (4) In carrying out his duties under this subsection and
    subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary shall, to the maximum
    extent practicable - 
        (A) use personnel, facilities, and other technical support
      available in other Federal agencies,

      conferences, workshops, or other means, by informed persons
      representative of scientific, professional, industry, or consumer
      organizations who in his judgment can make a significant
      contribution.
    (b) Establishment of a standard
      (1)(A) The Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register a
    notice of proposed rulemaking for the establishment, amendment, or
    revocation of any performance standard for a device.
      (B) A notice of proposed rulemaking for the establishment or
    amendment of a performance standard for a device shall - 
        (i) set forth a finding with supporting justification that the
      performance standard is appropriate and necessary to provide
      reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the
      device,
        (ii) set forth proposed findings with respect to the risk of
      illness or injury that the performance standard is intended to
      reduce or eliminate,
        (iii) invite interested persons to submit to the Secretary,
      within 30 days of the publication of the notice, requests for
      changes in the classification of the device pursuant to section
      360c(e) of this title based on new information relevant to the
      classification, and
        (iv) invite interested persons to submit an existing
      performance standard for the device, including a draft or
      proposed performance standard, for consideration by the
      Secretary.

      (C) A notice of proposed rulemaking for the revocation of a
    performance standard shall set forth a finding with supporting
    justification that the performance standard is no longer necessary
    to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of
    a device.
      (D) The Secretary shall provide for a comment period of not less
    than 60 days.
      (2) If, after publication of a notice in accordance with
    paragraph (1), the Secretary receives a request for a change in the
    classification of the device, the Secretary shall, within 60 days
    of the publication of the notice, after consultation with the
    appropriate panel under section 360c of this title, either deny the
    request or give notice of an intent to initiate such change under
    section 360c(e) of this title.
      (3)(A) After the expiration of the period for comment on a notice
    of proposed rulemaking published under paragraph (1) respecting a
    performance standard and after consideration of such comments and
    any report from an advisory committee under paragraph (5), the
    Secretary shall (i) promulgate a regulation establishing a
    performance standard and publish in the Federal Register findings
    on the matters referred to in paragraph (1), or (ii) publish a
    notice terminating the proceeding for the development of the
    standard together with the reasons for such termination. If a
    notice of termination is published, the Secretary shall (unless
    such notice is issued because the device is a banned device under
    section 360f of this title) initiate a proceeding under section
    360c(e) of this title to reclassify the device subject to the
    proceeding terminated by such notice.
      (B) A regulation establishing a performance standard shall set
    forth the date or dates upon which the standard shall take effect,
    but no such regulation may take effect before one year after the
    date of its publication unless (i) the Secretary determines that an
    earlier effective date is necessary for the protection of the
    public health and safety, or (ii) such standard has been
    established for a device which, effective upon the effective date
    of the standard, has been reclassified from class III to class II.
    Such date or dates shall be established so as to minimize,
    consistent with the public health and safety, economic loss to, and
    disruption or dislocation of, domestic and international trade.
      (4)(A) The Secretary, upon his own initiative or upon petition of
    an interested person may by regulation, promulgated in accordance
    with the requirements of paragraphs (1), (2), and (3)(B) of this
    subsection, amend or revoke a performance standard.
      (B) The Secretary may declare a proposed amendment of a
    performance standard to be effective on and after its publication
    in the Federal Register and until the effective date of any final
    action taken on such amendment if he determines that making it so
    effective is in the public interest. A proposed amendment of a
    performance standard made so effective under the preceding sentence
    may not prohibit, during the period in which it is so effective,
    the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate
    commerce of a device which conforms to such standard without the
    change or changes provided by such proposed amendment.
      (5)(A) The Secretary - 
        (i) may on his own initiative refer a proposed regulation for
      the establishment, amendment, or revocation of a performance
      standard, or
        (ii) shall, upon the request of an interested person which
      demonstrates good cause for referral and which is made before the
      expiration of the period for submission of comments on such
      proposed regulation refer such proposed regulation,

    to an advisory committee of experts, established pursuant to
    subparagraph (B), for a report and recommendation with respect to
    any matter involved in the proposed regulation which requires the
    exercise of scientific judgment. If a proposed regulation is
    referred under this subparagraph to an advisory committee, the
    Secretary shall provide the advisory committee with the data and
    information on which such proposed regulation is based. The
    advisory committee shall, within sixty days of the referral of a
    proposed regulation and after independent study of the data and
    information furnished to it by the Secretary and other data and
    information before it, submit to the Secretary a report and
    recommendation respecting such regulation, together with all
    underlying data and information and a statement of the reason or
    basis for the recommendation. A copy of such report and
    recommendation shall be made public by the Secretary.
      (B) The Secretary shall establish advisory committees (which may
    not be panels under section 360c of this title) to receive
    referrals under subparagraph (A). The Secretary shall appoint as
    members of any such advisory committee persons qualified in the
    subject matter to be referred to the committee and of appropriately
    diversified professional background, except that the Secretary may
    not appoint to such a committee any individual who is in the
    regular full-time employ of the United States and engaged in the
    administration of this chapter. Each such committee shall include
    as nonvoting members a representative of consumer interests and a
    representative of interests of the device manufacturing industry.
    Members of an advisory committee who are not officers or employees
    of the United States, while attending conferences or meetings of
    their committee or otherwise serving at the request of the
    Secretary, shall be entitled to receive compensation at rates to be
    fixed by the Secretary, which rates may not exceed the daily
    equivalent of the rate in effect for grade GS-18 of the General
    Schedule, for each day (including traveltime) they are so engaged;
    and while so serving away from their homes or regular places of
    business each member may be allowed travel expenses, including per
    diem in lieu of subsistence, as authorized by section 5703 of title
    5 for persons in the Government service employed intermittently.
    The Secretary shall designate one of the members of each advisory
    committee to serve as chairman thereof. The Secretary shall furnish
    each advisory committee with clerical and other assistance, and
    shall by regulation prescribe the procedures to be followed by each
    such committee in acting on referrals made under subparagraph (A).
    (c) Recognition of standard
      (1)(A) In addition to establishing a performance standard under
    this section, the Secretary shall, by publication in the Federal
    Register, recognize all or part of an appropriate standard
    established by a nationally or internationally recognized standard
    development organization for which a person may submit a
    declaration of conformity in order to meet a premarket submission
    requirement or other requirement under this chapter to which such
    standard is applicable.
      (B) If a person elects to use a standard recognized by the
    Secretary under subparagraph (A) to meet the requirements described
    in such subparagraph, the person shall provide a declaration of
    conformity to the Secretary that certifies that the device is in
    conformity with such standard. A person may elect to use data, or
    information, other than data required by a standard recognized
    under subparagraph (A) to meet any requirement regarding devices
    under this chapter.
      (2) The Secretary may withdraw such recognition of a standard
    through publication of a notice in the Federal Register if the
    Secretary determines that the standard is no longer appropriate for
    meeting a requirement regarding devices under this chapter.
      (3)(A) Subject to subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall accept a
    declaration of conformity that a device is in conformity with a
    standard recognized under paragraph (1) unless the Secretary finds -
     
        (i) that the data or information submitted to support such
      declaration does not demonstrate that the device is in conformity
      with the standard identified in the declaration of conformity; or
        (ii) that the standard identified in the declaration of
      conformity is not applicable to the particular device under
      review.

      (B) The Secretary may request, at any time, the data or
    information relied on by the person to make a declaration of
    conformity with respect to a standard recognized under paragraph
    (1).
      (C) A person making a declaration of conformity with respect to a
    standard recognized under paragraph (1) shall maintain the data and
    information demonstrating conformity of the device to the standard
    for a period of two years after the date of the classification or
    approval of the device by the Secretary or a period equal to the
    expected design life of the device, whichever is longer.

      paragraph (1).
        (ii) Subject to clause (i), the provisions of this section
      apply to a report under subparagraph (A) to the same extent and
      in the same manner as such provisions apply to an application
      under paragraph (1).
        (iii) Each reference in other sections of this chapter to an
      application under this section, other than such a reference in
      section 379i or 379j of this title, shall be considered to be a
      reference to a report under subparagraph (A).
        (iv) Each reference in other sections of this chapter to a
      device for which an application under this section has been
      approved, or has been denied, suspended, or withdrawn, other than
      such a reference in section 379i or 379j of this title, shall be
      considered to be a reference to a device for which a report under
      subparagraph (A) has been approved, or has been denied,
      suspended, or withdrawn, respectively.
      (3) Upon receipt of an application meeting the requirements set
    forth in paragraph (1), the Secretary - 
        (A) may on the Secretary's own initiative, or
        (B) shall, upon the request of an applicant unless the
      Secretary finds that the information in the application which
      would be reviewed by a panel substantially duplicates information
      which has previously been reviewed by a panel appointed under
      section 360c of this title,

    refer such application to the appropriate panel under section 360c
    of this title for study and for submission (within such period as
    he may establish) of a report and recommendation respecting
    approval of the application, together with all underlying data and
    the reasons or basis for the recommendation. Where appropriate, the
    Secretary shall ensure that such panel includes, or consults with,
    one or more pediatric experts.
      (4)(A) Prior to the submission of an application under this
    subsection, the Secretary shall accept and review any portion of
    the application that the applicant and the Secretary agree is
    complete, ready, and appropriate for review, except that such
    requirement does not apply, and the Secretary has discretion
    whether to accept and review such portion, during any period in
    which, under section 379j(g) of this title, the Secretary does not
    have the authority to collect fees under section 379j(a) of this
    title.
      (B) Each portion of a submission reviewed under subparagraph (A)
    and found acceptable by the Secretary shall not be further reviewed
    after receipt of an application that satisfies the requirements of
    paragraph (1), unless a significant issue of safety or
    effectiveness provides the Secretary reason to review such accepted
    portion.
      (C) Whenever the Secretary determines that a portion of a
    submission under subparagraph (A) is unacceptable, the Secretary
    shall, in writing, provide to the applicant a description of any
    deficiencies in such portion and identify the information that is
    required to correct these deficiencies, unless the applicant is no
    longer pursuing the application.
    (d) Action on application for premarket approval
      (1)(A) As promptly as possible, but in no event later than one
    hundred and eighty days after the receipt of an application under
    subsection (c) of this section (except as provided in section
    360j(l)(3)(D)(ii) of this title or unless, in accordance with
    subparagraph (B)(i), an additional period as agreed upon by the
    Secretary and the applicant), the Secretary, after considering the
    report and recommendation submitted under paragraph (2) of such
    subsection, shall - 
        (i) issue an order approving the application if he finds that
      none of the grounds for denying approval specified in paragraph
      (2) of this subsection applies; or
        (ii) deny approval of the application if he finds (and sets
      forth the basis for such finding as part of or accompanying such
      denial) that one or more grounds for denial specified in
      paragraph (2) of this subsection apply.

    In making the determination whether to approve or deny the
    application, the Secretary shall rely on the conditions of use
    included in the proposed labeling as the basis for determining
    whether or not there is a reasonable assurance of safety and
    effectiveness, if the proposed labeling is neither false nor
    misleading. In determining whether or not such labeling is false or
    misleading, the Secretary shall fairly evaluate all material facts
    pertinent to the proposed labeling.
      (B)(i) The Secretary may not enter into an agreement to extend
    the period in which to take action with respect to an application
    submitted for a device subject to a regulation promulgated under
    subsection (b) of this section unless he finds that the continued
    availability of the device is necessary for the public health.
      (ii) An order approving an application for a device may require
    as a condition to such approval that the sale and distribution of
    the device be restricted but only to the extent that the sale and
    distribution of a device may be restricted under a regulation under
    section 360j(e) of this title.
      (iii) The Secretary shall accept and review statistically valid
    and reliable data and any other information from investigations
    conducted under the authority of regulations required by section
    360j(g) of this title to make a determination of whether there is a
    reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of a device
    subject to a pending application under this section if - 
        (I) the data or information is derived from investigations of
      an earlier version of the device, the device has been modified
      during or after the investigations (but prior to submission of an
      application under subsection (c) of this section) and such a
      modification of the device does not constitute a significant
      change in the design or in the basic principles of operation of
      the device that would invalidate the data or information; or
        (II) the data or information relates to a device approved under
      this section, is available for use under this chapter, and is
      relevant to the design and intended use of the device for which
      the application is pending.

      (2) The Secretary shall deny approval of an application for a
    device if, upon the basis of the information submitted to the
    Secretary as part of the application and any other information
    before him with respect to such device, the Secretary finds that - 
        (A) there is a lack of a showing of reasonable assurance that
      such device is safe under the conditions of use prescribed,
      recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling thereof;
        (B) there is a lack of a showing of reasonable assurance that
      the device is effective under the conditions of use prescribed,
      recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling thereof;
        (C) the methods used in, or the facilities or controls used
      for, the manufacture, processing, packing, or installation of
      such device do not conform to the requirements of section 360j(f)
      of this title;
        (D) based on a fair evaluation of all material facts, the
      proposed labeling is false or misleading in any particular; or
        (E) such device is not shown to conform in all respects to a
      performance standard in effect under section 360d of this title
      compliance with which is a condition to approval of the
      application and there is a lack of adequate information to
      justify the deviation from such standard.

    Any denial of an application shall, insofar as the Secretary
    determines to be practicable, be accompanied by a statement
    informing the applicant of the measures required to place such
    application in approvable form (which measures may include further
    research by the applicant in accordance with one or more protocols
    prescribed by the Secretary).
      (3)(A)(i) The Secretary shall, upon the written request of an
    applicant, meet with the applicant, not later than 100 days after
    the receipt of an application that has been filed as complete under
    subsection (c) of this section, to discuss the review status of the
    application.
      (ii) The Secretary shall, in writing and prior to the meeting,
    provide to the applicant a description of any deficiencies in the
    application that, at that point, have been identified by the
    Secretary based on an interim review of the entire application and
    identify the information that is required to correct those
    deficiencies.
      (iii) The Secretary shall notify the applicant promptly of - 
        (I) any additional deficiency identified in the application, or
        (II) any additional information required to achieve completion
      of the review and final action on the application,

    that was not described as a deficiency in the written description
    provided by the Secretary under clause (ii).
      (B) The Secretary and the applicant may, by mutual consent,
    establish a different schedule for a meeting required under this
    paragraph.
      (4) An applicant whose application has been denied approval may,
    by petition filed on or before the thirtieth day after the date
    upon which he receives notice of such denial, obtain review thereof
    in accordance with either paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (g) of
    this section, and any interested person may obtain review, in
    accordance with paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (g) of this
    section, of an order of the Secretary approving an application.
      (5) In order to provide for more effective treatment or diagnosis
    of life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating human diseases or
    conditions, the Secretary shall provide review priority for devices
    - 
        (A) representing breakthrough technologies,
        (B) for which no approved alternatives exist,
        (C) which offer significant advantages over existing approved
      alternatives, or
        (D) the availability of which is in the best interest of the
      patients.

      (6)(A)(i) A supplemental application shall be required for any
    change to a device subject to an approved application under this
    subsection that affects safety or effectiveness, unless such change
    is a modification in a manufacturing procedure or method of
    manufacturing and the holder of the approved application submits a
    written notice to the Secretary that describes in detail the
    change, summarizes the data or information supporting the change,
    and informs the Secretary that the change has been made under the
    requirements of section 360j(f) of this title.
      (ii) The holder of an approved application who submits a notice
    under clause (i) with respect to a manufacturing change of a device
    may distribute the device 30 days after the date on which the
    Secretary receives the notice, unless the Secretary within such 30-
    day period notifies the holder that the notice is not adequate and
    describes such further information or action that is required for
    acceptance of such change. If the Secretary notifies the holder
    that a supplemental application is required, the Secretary shall
    review the supplement within 135 days after the receipt of the
    supplement. The time used by the Secretary to review the notice of
    the manufacturing change shall be deducted from the 135-day review
    period if the notice meets appropriate content requirements for
    premarket approval supplements.
      (B)(i) Subject to clause (ii), in reviewing a supplement to an
    approved application, for an incremental change to the design of a
    device that affects safety or effectiveness, the Secretary shall
    approve such supplement if - 
        (I) nonclinical data demonstrate that the design modification
      creates the intended additional capacity, function, or
      performance of the device; and
        (II) clinical data from the approved application and any
      supplement to the approved application provide a reasonable
      assurance of safety and effectiveness for the changed device.

      (ii) The Secretary may require, when necessary, additional
    clinical data to evaluate the design modification of the device to
    provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.
    (e) Withdrawal and temporary suspension of approval of application
      (1) The Secretary shall, upon obtaining, where appropriate,
    advice on scientific matters from a panel or panels under section
    360c of this title, and after due notice and opportunity for
    informal hearing to the holder of an approved application for a
    device, issue an order withdrawing approval of the application if
    the Secretary finds - 
        (A) that such device is unsafe or ineffective under the
      conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the
      labeling thereof;
        (B) on the basis of new information before him with respect to
      such device, evaluated together with the evidence available to
      him when the application was approved, that there is a lack of a
      showing of reasonable assurance that the device is safe or
      effective under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or
      suggested in the labeling thereof;
        (C) that the application contained or was accompanied by an
      untrue statement of a material fact;
        (D) that the applicant (i) has failed to establish a system for
      maintaining records, or has repeatedly or deliberately failed to
      maintain records or to make reports, required by an applicable
      regulation under section 360i(a) of this title, (ii) has refused
      to permit access to, or copying or verification of, such records
      as required by section 374 of this title, or (iii) has not
      complied with the requirements of section 360 of this title;
        (E) on the basis of new information before him with respect to
      such device, evaluated together with the evidence before him when
      the application was approved, that the methods used in, or the
      facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, processing,
      packing, or installation of such device do not conform with the
      requirements of section 360j(f) of this title and were not
      brought into conformity with such requirements within a
      reasonable time after receipt of written notice from the
      Secretary of nonconformity;
        (F) on the basis of new information before him, evaluated
      together with the evidence before him when the application was
      approved, that the labeling of such device, based on a fair
      evaluation of all material facts, is false or misleading in any
      particular and was not corrected within a reasonable time after
      receipt of written notice from the Secretary of such fact; or
        (G) on the basis of new information before him, evaluated
      together with the evidence before him when the application was
      approved, that such device is not shown to conform in all
      respects to a performance standard which is in effect under
      section 360d of this title compliance with which was a condition
      to approval of the application and that there is a lack of
      adequate information to justify the deviation from such standard.

      (2) The holder of an application subject to an order issued under
    paragraph (1) withdrawing approval of the application may, by
    petition filed on or before the thirtieth day after the date upon
    which he receives notice of such withdrawal, obtain review thereof
    in accordance with either paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (g) of
    this section.
      (3) If, after providing an opportunity for an informal hearing,
    the Secretary determines there is reasonable probability that the
    continuation of distribution of a device under an approved
    application would cause serious, adverse health consequences or
    death, the Secretary shall by order temporarily suspend the
    approval of the application approved under this section. If the
    Secretary issues such an order, the Secretary shall proceed
    expeditiously under paragraph (1) to withdraw such application.
    (f) Product development protocol
      (1) In the case of a class III device which is required to have
    an approval of an application submitted under subsection (c) of
    this section, such device shall be considered as having such an
    approval if a notice of completion of testing conducted in
    accordance with a product development protocol approved under
    paragraph (4) has been declared completed under paragraph (6).
      (2) Any person may submit to the Secretary a proposed product
    development protocol with respect to a device. Such a protocol
    shall be accompanied by data supporting it. If, within thirty days
    of the receipt of such a protocol, the Secretary determines that it
    appears to be appropriate to apply the requirements of this
    subsection to the device with respect to which the protocol is
    submitted, the Secretary - 
        (A) may, at the initiative of the Secretary, refer the proposed
      protocol to the appropriate panel under section 360c of this
      title for its recommendation respecting approval of the protocol;
      or
        (B) shall so refer such protocol upon the request of the
      submitter, unless the Secretary finds that the proposed protocol
      and accompanying data which would be reviewed by such panel
      substantially duplicate a product development protocol and
      accompanying data which have previously been reviewed by such a
      panel.

      (3) A proposed product development protocol for a device may be
    approved only if - 
        (A) the Secretary determines that it is appropriate to apply
      the requirements of this subsection to the device in lieu of the
      requirement of approval of an application submitted under
      subsection (c) of this section; and
        (B) the Secretary determines that the proposed protocol
      provides - 
          (i) a description of the device and the changes which may be
        made in the device,
          (ii) a description of the preclinical trials (if any) of the
        device and a specification of (I) the results from such trials
        to be required before the commencement of clinical trials of
        the device, and (II) any permissible variations in preclinical
        trials and the results therefrom,
          (iii) a description of the clinical trials (if any) of the
        device and a specification of (I) the results from such trials
        to be required before the filing of a notice of completion of
        the requirements of the protocol, and (II) any permissible
        variations in such trials and the results therefrom,
          (iv) a description of the methods to be used in, and the
        facilities and controls to be used for, the manufacture,
        processing, and, when relevant, packing and installation of the
        device,
          (v) an identifying reference to any performance standard
        under section 360d of this title to be applicable to any aspect
        of such device,
          (vi) if appropriate, specimens of the labeling proposed to be
        used for such device,
          (vii) such other information relevant to the subject matter
        of the protocol as the Secretary, with the concurrence of the
        appropriate panel or panels under section 360c of this title,
        may require, and
          (viii) a requirement for submission of progress reports and,
        when completed, records of the trials conducted under the
        protocol which records are adequate to show compliance with the
        protocol.

      (4) The Secretary shall approve or disapprove a proposed product
    development protocol submitted under paragraph (2) within one
    hundred and twenty days of its receipt unless an additional period
    is agreed upon by the Secretary and the person who submitted the
    protocol. Approval of a protocol or denial of approval of a
    protocol is final agency action subject to judicial review under
    chapter 7 of title 5.
      (5) At any time after a product development protocol for a device
    has been approved pursuant to paragraph (4), the person for whom
    the protocol was approved may submit a notice of completion - 
        (A) stating (i) his determination that the requirements of the
      protocol have been fulfilled and that, to the best of his
      knowledge, there is no reason bearing on safety or effectiveness
      why the notice of completion should not become effective, and
      (ii) the data and other information upon which such determination
      was made, and
        (B) setting forth the results of the trials required by the
      protocol and all the information required by subsection (c)(1) of
      this section.

      (6)(A) The Secretary may, after providing the person who has an
    approved protocol and opportunity for an informal hearing and at
    any time prior to receipt of notice of completion of such protocol,
    issue a final order to revoke such protocol if he finds that - 
        (i) such person has failed substantially to comply with the
      requirements of the protocol,
        (ii) the results of the trials obtained under the protocol
      differ so substantially from the results required by the protocol
      that further trials cannot be justified, or
        (iii) the results of the trials conducted under the protocol or
      available new information do not demonstrate that the device
      tested under the protocol does not present an unreasonable risk
      to health and safety.

      (B) After the receipt of a notice of completion of an approved
    protocol the Secretary shall, within the ninety-day period
    beginning on the date such notice is received, by order either
    declare the protocol completed or declare it not completed. An
    order declaring a protocol not completed may take effect only after
    the Secretary has provided the person who has the protocol
    opportunity for an informal hearing on the order. Such an order may
    be issued only if the Secretary finds - 
        (i) such person has failed substantially to comply with the
      requirements of the protocol,
        (ii) the results of the trials obtained under the protocol
      differ substantially from the results required by the protocol,
      or
        (iii) there is a lack of a showing of reasonable assurance of
      the safety and effectiveness of the device under the conditions
      of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed
      labeling thereof.

      (C) A final order issued under subparagraph (A) or (B) shall be
    in writing and shall contain the reasons to support the conclusions
    thereof.
      (7) At any time after a notice of completion has become
    effective, the Secretary may issue an order (after due notice and
    opportunity for an informal hearing to the person for whom the
    notice is effective) revoking the approval of a device provided by
    a notice of completion which has become effective as provided in
    subparagraph (B) if he finds that any of the grounds listed in
    subparagraphs (A) through (G) of subsection (e)(1) of this section
    apply. Each reference in such subparagraphs to an application shall
    be considered for purposes of this paragraph as a reference to a
    protocol and the notice of completion of such protocol, and each
    reference to the time when an application was approved shall be
    considered for purposes of this paragraph as a reference to the
    time when a notice of completion took effect.
      (8) A person who has an approved protocol subject to an order
    issued under paragraph (6)(A) revoking such protocol, a person who
    has an approved protocol with respect to which an order under
    paragraph (6)(B) was issued declaring that the protocol had not
    been completed, or a person subject to an order issued under
    paragraph (7) revoking the approval of a device may, by petition
    filed on or before the thirtieth day after the date upon which he
    receives notice of such order, obtain review thereof in accordance
    with either paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (g) of this section.
    (g) Review
      (1) Upon petition for review of - 
        (A) an order under subsection (d) of this section approving or
      denying approval of an application or an order under subsection
      (e) of this section withdrawing approval of an application, or
        (B) an order under subsection (f)(6)(A) of this section
      revoking an approved protocol, under subsection (f)(6)(B) of this
      section declaring that an approved protocol has not been
      completed, or under subsection (f)(7) of this section revoking
      the approval of a device,

    the Secretary shall, unless he finds the petition to be without
    good cause or unless a petition for review of such order has been
    submitted under paragraph (2), hold a hearing, in accordance with
    section 554 of title 5, on the order. The panel or panels which
    considered the application, protocol, or device subject to such
    order shall designate a member to appear and testify at any such
    hearing upon request of the Secretary, the petitioner, or the
    officer conducting the hearing, but this requirement does not
    preclude any other member of the panel or panels from appearing and
    testifying at any such hearing. Upon completion of such hearing and
    after considering the record established in such hearing, the
    Secretary shall issue an order either affirming the order subject
    to the hearing or reversing such order and, as appropriate,
    approving or denying approval of the application, reinstating the
    application's approval, approving the protocol, or placing in
    effect a notice of completion.
      (2)(A) Upon petition for review of - 
        (i) an order under subsection (d) of this section approving or
      denying approval of an application or an order under subsection
      (e) of this section withdrawing approval of an application, or
        (ii) an order under subsection (f)(6)(A) of this section
      revoking an approved protocol, under subsection (f)(6)(B) of this
      section declaring that an approved protocol has not been
      completed, or under subsection (f)(7) of this section revoking
      the approval of a device,

    the Secretary shall refer the application or protocol subject to
    the order and the basis for the order to an advisory committee of
    experts established pursuant to subparagraph (B) for a report and
    recommendation with respect to the order. The advisory committee
    shall, after independent study of the data and information
    furnished to it by the Secretary and other data and information
    before it, submit to the Secretary a report and recommendation,
    together with all underlying data and information and a statement
    of the reasons or basis for the recommendation. A copy of such
    report shall be promptly supplied by the Secretary to any person
    who petitioned for such referral to the advisory committee.
      (B) The Secretary shall establish advisory committees (which may
    not be panels under section 360c of this title) to receive
    referrals under subparagraph (A). The Secretary shall appoint as
    members of any such advisory committee persons qualified in the
    subject matter to be referred to the committee and of appropriately
    diversified professional backgrounds, except that the Secretary may
    not appoint to such a committee any individual who is in the
    regular full-time employ of the United States and engaged in the
    administration of this chapter. Members of an advisory committee
    (other than officers or employees of the United States), while
    attending conferences or meetings of their committee or otherwise
    serving at the request of the Secretary, shall be entitled to
    receive compensation at rates to be fixed by the Secretary, which
    rates may not exceed the daily equivalent for grade GS-18 of the
    General Schedule for each day (including traveltime) they are so
    engaged; and while so serving away from their homes or regular
    places of business each member may be allowed travel expenses,
    including per diem in lieu of subsistence, as authorized by section
    5703 of title 5 for persons in the Government service employed
    intermittently. The Secretary shall designate the chairman of an
    advisory committee from its members. The Secretary shall furnish
    each advisory committee with clerical and other assistance, and
    shall by regulation prescribe the procedures to be followed by each
    such committee in acting on referrals made under subparagraph (A).
      (C) The Secretary shall make public the report and recommendation
    made by an advisory committee with respect to an application and
    shall by order, stating the reasons therefor, either affirm the
    order referred to the advisory committee or reverse such order and,
    if appropriate, approve or deny approval of the application,
    reinstate the application's approval, approve the protocol, or
    place in effect a notice of completion.
    (h) Service of orders
      Orders of the Secretary under this section shall be served (1) in
    person by any officer or employee of the department designated by
    the Secretary, or (2) by mailing the order by registered mail or
    certified mail addressed to the applicant at his last known address
    in the records of the Secretary.
    (i) Revision
      (1) Before December 1, 1995, the Secretary shall by order require
    manufacturers of devices, which were introduced or delivered for
    introduction into interstate commerce for commercial distribution
    before May 28, 1976, and which are subject to revision of
    classification under paragraph (2), to submit to the Secretary a
    summary of and citation to any information known or otherwise
    available to the manufacturer respecting such devices, including
    adverse safety or effectiveness information which has not been
    submitted under section 360i of this title. The Secretary may
    require the manufacturer to submit the adverse safety or
    effectiveness data for which a summary and citation were submitted,
    if such data are available to the manufacturer.
      (2) After the issuance of an order under paragraph (1) but before
    December 1, 1995, the Secretary shall publish a regulation in the
    Federal Register for each device - 
        (A) which the Secretary has classified as a class III device,
      and
        (B) for which no final regulation has been promulgated under
      subsection (b) of this section,

    revising the classification of the device so that the device is
    classified into class I or class II, unless the regulation requires
    the device to remain in class III. In determining whether to revise
    the classification of a device or to require a device to remain in
    class III, the Secretary shall apply the criteria set forth in
    section 360c(a) of this title. Before the publication of a
    regulation requiring a device to remain in class III or revising
    its classification, the Secretary shall publish a proposed
    regulation respecting the classification of a device under this
    paragraph and provide reasonable opportunity for the submission of
    comments on any such regulation. No regulation requiring a device
    to remain in class III or revising its classification may take
    effect before the expiration of 90 days from the date of its
    publication in the Federal Register as a proposed regulation.
      (3) The Secretary shall, as promptly as is reasonably achievable,
    but not later than 12 months after the effective date of the
    regulation requiring a device to remain in class III, establish a
    schedule for the promulgation of a subsection (b) of this section
    regulation for each device which is subject to the regulation
    requiring the device to remain in class III.

    (a) General rule
      Whenever the Secretary finds, on the basis of all available data
    and information, that - 
        (1) a device intended for human use presents substantial
      deception or an unreasonable and substantial risk of illness or
      injury; and
        (2) in the case of substantial deception or an unreasonable and
      substantial risk of illness or injury which the Secretary
      determined could be corrected or eliminated by labeling or change
      in labeling and with respect to which the Secretary provided
      written notice to the manufacturer specifying the deception or
      risk of illness or injury, the labeling or change in labeling to
      correct the deception or eliminate or reduce such risk, and the
      period within which such labeling or change in labeling was to be
      done, such labeling or change in labeling was not done within
      such period;

    he may initiate a proceeding to promulgate a regulation to make
    such device a banned device.
    (b) Special effective date
      The Secretary may declare a proposed regulation under subsection
    (a) of this section to be effective upon its publication in the
    Federal Register and until the effective date of any final action
    taken respecting such regulation if (1) he determines, on the basis
    of all available data and information, that the deception or risk
    of illness or injury associated with the use of the device which is
    subject to the regulation presents an unreasonable, direct, and
    substantial danger to the health of individuals, and (2) before the
    date of the publication of such regulation, the Secretary notifies
    the manufacturer of such device that such regulation is to be made
    so effective. If the Secretary makes a proposed regulation so
    effective, he shall, as expeditiously as possible, give interested
    persons prompt notice of his action under this subsection, provide
    reasonable opportunity for an informal hearing on the proposed
    regulation, and either affirm, modify, or revoke such proposed
    regulation.

    administrative proceeding held with respect to such regulation or
    order, as being relevant to such regulation or order.
    (b) Additional data, views, and arguments
      If the petitioner applies to the court for leave to adduce
    additional data, views, or arguments respecting the regulation or
    order being reviewed and shows to the satisfaction of the court
    that such additional data, views, or arguments are material and
    that there were reasonable grounds for the petitioner's failure to
    adduce such data, views, or arguments in the proceedings before the
    Secretary, the court may order the Secretary to provide additional
    opportunity for the oral presentation of data, views, or arguments
    and for written submissions. The Secretary may modify his findings,
    or make new findings by reason of the additional data, views, or
    arguments so taken and shall file with the court such modified or
    new findings, and his recommendation, if any, for the modification
    or setting aside of the regulation or order being reviewed, with
    the return of such additional data, views, or arguments.

    relief, including interim relief, as provided in such chapter. A
    regulation described in paragraph (2) or (5) of subsection (a) of
    this section and an order issued after the review provided by
    section 360e(g) of this title shall not be affirmed if it is found
    to be unsupported by substantial evidence on the record taken as a
    whole.
    (d) Finality of judgments

    Sec. 360h. Notification and other remedies

-STATUTE-
    (a) Notification
      If the Secretary determines that - 
        (1) a device intended for human use which is introduced or
      delivered for introduction into interstate commerce for
      commercial distribution presents an unreasonable risk of
      substantial harm to the public health, and
        (2) notification under this subsection is necessary to
      eliminate the unreasonable risk of such harm and no more
      practicable means is available under the provisions of this
      chapter (other than this section) to eliminate such risk,

    the Secretary may issue such order as may be necessary to assure
    that adequate notification is provided in an appropriate form, by
    the persons and means best suited under the circumstances involved,
    to all health professionals who prescribe or use the device and to
    any other person (including manufacturers, importers, distributors,
    retailers, and device users) who should properly receive such
    notification in order to eliminate such risk. An order under this
    subsection shall require that the individuals subject to the risk
    with respect to which the order is to be issued be included in the
    persons to be notified of the risk unless the Secretary determines
    that notice to such individuals would present a greater danger to
    the health of such individuals than no such notification. If the
    Secretary makes such a determination with respect to such
    individuals, the order shall require that the health professionals
    who prescribe or use the device provide for the notification of the
    individuals whom the health professionals treated with the device
    of the risk presented by the device and of any action which may be
    taken by or on behalf of such individuals to eliminate or reduce
    such risk. Before issuing an order under this subsection, the
    Secretary shall consult with the persons who are to give notice
    under the order.
    (b) Repair, replacement, or refund
      (1)(A) If, after affording opportunity for an informal hearing,
    the Secretary determines that - 
        (i) a device intended for human use which is introduced or
      delivered for introduction into interstate commerce for
      commercial distribution presents an unreasonable risk of
      substantial harm to the public health,
        (ii) there are reasonable grounds to believe that the device
      was not properly designed or manufactured with reference to the
      state of the art as it existed at the time of its design or
      manufacture,
        (iii) there are reasonable grounds to believe that the
      unreasonable risk was not caused by failure of a person other
      than a manufacturer, importer, distributor, or retailer of the
      device to exercise due care in the installation, maintenance,
      repair, or use of the device, and
        (iv) the notification authorized by subsection (a) of this
      section would not by itself be sufficient to eliminate the
      unreasonable risk and action described in paragraph (2) of this
      subsection is necessary to eliminate such risk,

    the Secretary may order the manufacturer, importer, or any
    distributor of such device, or any combination of such persons, to
    submit to him within a reasonable time a plan for taking one or
    more of the actions described in paragraph (2). An order issued
    under the preceding sentence which is directed to more than one
    person shall specify which person may decide which action shall be
    taken under such plan and the person specified shall be the person
    who the Secretary determines bears the principal, ultimate
    financial responsibility for action taken under the plan unless the
    Secretary cannot determine who bears such responsibility or the
    Secretary determines that the protection of the public health
    requires that such decision be made by a person (including a device
    user or health professional) other than the person he determines
    bears such responsibility.
      (B) The Secretary shall approve a plan submitted pursuant to an
    order issued under subparagraph (A) unless he determines (after
    affording opportunity for an informal hearing) that the action or
    actions to be taken under the plan or the manner in which such
    action or actions are to be taken under the plan will not assure
    that the unreasonable risk with respect to which such order was
    issued will be eliminated. If the Secretary disapproves a plan, he
    shall order a revised plan to be submitted to him within a
    reasonable time. If the Secretary determines (after affording
    opportunity for an informal hearing) that the revised plan is
    unsatisfactory or if no revised plan or no initial plan has been
    submitted to the Secretary within the prescribed time, the
    Secretary shall (i) prescribe a plan to be carried out by the
    person or persons to whom the order issued under subparagraph (A)
    was directed, or (ii) after affording an opportunity for an
    informal hearing, by order prescribe a plan to be carried out by a
    person who is a manufacturer, importer, distributor, or retailer of
    the device with respect to which the order was issued but to whom
    the order under subparagraph (A) was not directed.
      (2) The actions which may be taken under a plan submitted under
    an order issued under paragraph (1) are as follows:
        (A) To repair the device so that it does not present the
      unreasonable risk of substantial harm with respect to which the
      order under paragraph (1) was issued.
        (B) To replace the device with a like or equivalent device
      which is in conformity with all applicable requirements of this
      chapter.
        (C) To refund the purchase price of the device (less a
      reasonable allowance for use if such device has been in the
      possession of the device user for one year or more - 
          (i) at the time of notification ordered under subsection (a)
        of this section, or
          (ii) at the time the device user receives actual notice of
        the unreasonable risk with respect to which the order was
        issued under paragraph (1),

      whichever first occurs).

      (3) No charge shall be made to any person (other than a
    manufacturer, importer, distributor or retailer) for availing
    himself of any remedy, described in paragraph (2) and provided
    under an order issued under paragraph (1), and the person subject
    to the order shall reimburse each person (other than a
    manufacturer, importer, distributor, or retailer) who is entitled
    to such a remedy for any reasonable and foreseeable expenses
    actually incurred by such person in availing himself of such
    remedy.
    (c) Reimbursement
      An order issued under subsection (b) of this section with respect
    to a device may require any person who is a manufacturer, importer,
    distributor, or retailer of the device to reimburse any other
    person who is a manufacturer, importer, distributor, or retailer of
    such device for such other person's expenses actually incurred in
    connection with carrying out the order if the Secretary determines
    such reimbursement is required for the protection of the public
    health. Any such requirement shall not affect any rights or
    obligations under any contract to which the person receiving
    reimbursement or the person making such reimbursement is a party.
    (d) Effect on other liability
      Compliance with an order issued under this section shall not
    relieve any person from liability under Federal or State law. In
    awarding damages for economic loss in an action brought for the
    enforcement of any such liability, the value to the plaintiff in
    such action of any remedy provided him under such order shall be
    taken into account.
    (e) Recall authority
      (1) If the Secretary finds that there is a reasonable probability
    that a device intended for human use would cause serious, adverse
    health consequences or death, the Secretary shall issue an order
    requiring the appropriate person (including the manufacturers,
    importers, distributors, or retailers of the device) - 
        (A) to immediately cease distribution of such device, and
        (B) to immediately notify health professionals and device user
      facilities of the order and to instruct such professionals and
      facilities to cease use of such device.

    The order shall provide the person subject to the order with an
    opportunity for an informal hearing, to be held not later than 10
    days after the date of the issuance of the order, on the actions
    required by the order and on whether the order should be amended to
    require a recall of such device. If, after providing an opportunity
    for such a hearing, the Secretary determines that inadequate
    grounds exist to support the actions required by the order, the
    Secretary shall vacate the order.
      (2)(A) If, after providing an opportunity for an informal hearing
    under paragraph (1), the Secretary determines that the order should
    be amended to include a recall of the device with respect to which
    the order was issued, the Secretary shall, except as provided in
    subparagraphs (B) and (C), amend the order to require a recall. The
    Secretary shall specify a timetable in which the device recall will
    occur and shall require periodic reports to the Secretary
    describing the progress of the recall.
      (B) An amended order under subparagraph (A) - 
        (i) shall - 
          (I) not include recall of a device from individuals, and
          (II) not include recall of a device from device user
        facilities if the Secretary determines that the risk of
        recalling such device from the facilities presents a greater
        health risk than the health risk of not recalling the device
        from use, and

        (ii) shall provide for notice to individuals subject to the
      risks associated with the use of such device.

    In providing the notice required by clause (ii), the Secretary may
    use the assistance of health professionals who prescribed or used
    such a device for individuals. If a significant number of such
    individuals cannot be identified, the Secretary shall notify such
    individuals pursuant to section 375(b) of this title.
      (3) The remedy provided by this subsection shall be in addition
    to remedies provided by subsections (a), (b), and (c) of this
    section.

    Sec. 360i. Records and reports on devices

-STATUTE-
    (a) General rule
      Every person who is a manufacturer or importer of a device
    intended for human use shall establish and maintain such records,
    make such reports, and provide such information, as the Secretary
    may by regulation reasonably require to assure that such device is
    not adulterated or misbranded and to otherwise assure its safety
    and effectiveness. Regulations prescribed under the preceding
    sentence - 
        (1) shall require a device manufacturer or importer to report
      to the Secretary whenever the manufacturer or importer receives
      or otherwise becomes aware of information that reasonably
      suggests that one of its marketed devices - 
          (A) may have caused or contributed to a death or serious
        injury, or
          (B) has malfunctioned and that such device or a similar
        device marketed by the manufacturer or importer would be likely
        to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the
        malfunction were to recur;

        (2) shall define the term "serious injury" to mean an injury
      that - 
          (A) is life threatening,
          (B) results in permanent impairment of a body function or
        permanent damage to a body structure, or
          (C) necessitates medical or surgical intervention to preclude
        permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to
        a body structure;

        (3) shall require reporting of other significant adverse device
      experiences as determined by the Secretary to be necessary to be
      reported;
        (4) shall not impose requirements unduly burdensome to a device
      manufacturer or importer taking into account his cost of
      complying with such requirements and the need for the protection
      of the public health and the implementation of this chapter;
        (5) which prescribe the procedure for making requests for
      reports or information shall require that each request made under
      such regulations for submission of a report or information to the
      Secretary state the reason or purpose for such request and
      identify to the fullest extent practicable such report or
      information;
        (6) which require submission of a report or information to the
      Secretary shall state the reason or purpose for the submission of
      such report or information and identify to the fullest extent
      practicable such report or information;
        (7) may not require that the identity of any patient be
      disclosed in records, reports, or information required under this
      subsection unless required for the medical welfare of an
      individual, to determine the safety or effectiveness of a device,
      or to verify a record, report, or information submitted under
      this chapter; and
        (8) may not require a manufacturer or importer of a class I
      device to - 
          (A) maintain for such a device records respecting information
        not in the possession of the manufacturer or importer, or
          (B) to submit for such a device to the Secretary any report
        or information - 
            (i) not in the possession of the manufacturer or importer,
          or
            (ii) on a periodic basis,

      unless such report or information is necessary to determine if
      the device should be reclassified or if the device is adulterated
      or misbranded. and (!1)


    In prescribing such regulations, the Secretary shall have due
    regard for the professional ethics of the medical profession and
    the interests of patients. The prohibitions of paragraph (7) of
    this subsection continue to apply to records, reports, and
    information concerning any individual who has been a patient,
    irrespective of whether or when he ceases to be a patient. The
    Secretary shall by regulation require distributors to keep records
    and make such records available to the Secretary upon request.
    Paragraphs (4) and (8) apply to distributors to the same extent and
    in the same manner as such paragraphs apply to manufacturers and
    importers.
    (b) User reports
      (1)(A) Whenever a device user facility receives or otherwise
    becomes aware of information that reasonably suggests that a device
    has or may have caused or contributed to the death of a patient of
    the facility, the facility shall, as soon as practicable but not
    later than 10 working days after becoming aware of the information,
    report the information to the Secretary and, if the identity of the
    manufacturer is known, to the manufacturer of the device. In the
    case of deaths, the Secretary may by regulation prescribe a shorter
    period for the reporting of such information.
      (B) Whenever a device user facility receives or otherwise becomes
    aware of - 
        (i) information that reasonably suggests that a device has or
      may have caused or contributed to the serious illness of, or
      serious injury to, a patient of the facility, or
        (ii) other significant adverse device experiences as determined
      by the Secretary by regulation to be necessary to be reported,

    the facility shall, as soon as practicable but not later than 10
    working days after becoming aware of the information, report the
    information to the manufacturer of the device or to the Secretary
    if the identity of the manufacturer is not known.
      (C) Each device user facility shall submit to the Secretary on an
    annual basis a summary of the reports made under subparagraphs (A)
    and (B). Such summary shall be submitted on January 1 of each year.
    The summary shall be in such form and contain such information from
    such reports as the Secretary may require and shall include - 
        (i) sufficient information to identify the facility which made
      the reports for which the summary is submitted,
        (ii) in the case of any product which was the subject of a
      report, the product name, serial number, and model number,
        (iii) the name and the address of the manufacturer of such
      device, and
        (iv) a brief description of the event reported to the
      manufacturer.

      (D) For purposes of subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C), a device
    user facility shall be treated as having received or otherwise
    become aware of information with respect to a device of that
    facility when medical personnel who are employed by or otherwise
    formally affiliated with the facility receive or otherwise become
    aware of information with respect to that device in the course of
    their duties.
      (2) The Secretary may not disclose the identity of a device user
    facility which makes a report under paragraph (1) except in
    connection with - 
        (A) an action brought to enforce section 331(q) of this title,
      or
        (B) a communication to a manufacturer of a device which is the
      subject of a report under paragraph (1).

    This paragraph does not prohibit the Secretary from disclosing the
    identity of a device user facility making a report under paragraph
    (1) or any information in such a report to employees of the
    Department of Health and Human Services, to the Department of
    Justice, or to the duly authorized committees and subcommittees of
    the Congress.
      (3) No report made under paragraph (1) by - 
        (A) a device user facility,
        (B) an individual who is employed by or otherwise formally
      affiliated with such a facility, or
        (C) a physician who is not required to make such a report,

    shall be admissible into evidence or otherwise used in any civil
    action involving private parties unless the facility, individual,
    or physician who made the report had knowledge of the falsity of
    the information contained in the report.
      (4) A report made under paragraph (1) does not affect any
    obligation of a manufacturer who receives the report to file a
    report as required under subsection (a) of this section.
      (5) With respect to device user facilities:
        (A) The Secretary shall by regulation plan and implement a
      program under which the Secretary limits user reporting under
      paragraphs (1) through (4) to a subset of user facilities that
      constitutes a representative profile of user reports for device
      deaths and serious illnesses or serious injuries.
        (B) During the period of planning the program under
      subparagraph (A), paragraphs (1) through (4) continue to apply.
        (C) During the period in which the Secretary is providing for a
      transition to the full implementation of the program, paragraphs
      (1) through (4) apply except to the extent that the Secretary
      determines otherwise.
        (D) On and after the date on which the program is fully
      implemented, paragraphs (1) through (4) do not apply to a user

      under an exemption granted under section 360j(g) of this title);
      and
        (3) any other class of persons as the Secretary may by
      regulation exempt from subsection (a) of this section upon a
      finding that compliance with the requirements of such subsection

        (A) the failure of which would be reasonably likely to have
      serious adverse health consequences; or
        (B) which is - 
          (i) intended to be implanted in the human body for more than
        one year, or
          (ii) a life sustaining or life supporting device used outside
        a device user facility.

      (2) Any patient receiving a device subject to tracking under
    paragraph (1) may refuse to release, or refuse permission to
    release, the patient's name, address, social security number, or
    other identifying information for the purpose of tracking.
    (f) Reports of removals and corrections
      (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the Secretary shall by
    regulation require a manufacturer or importer of a device to report
    promptly to the Secretary any correction or removal of a device
    undertaken by such manufacturer or importer if the removal or
    correction was undertaken - 
        (A) to reduce a risk to health posed by the device, or
        (B) to remedy a violation of this chapter caused by the device
      which may present a risk to health.

    A manufacturer or importer of a device who undertakes a correction
    or removal of a device which is not required to be reported under
    this paragraph shall keep a record of such correction or removal.
      (2) No report of the corrective action or removal of a device may
    be required under paragraph (1) if a report of the corrective
    action or removal is required and has been submitted under
    subsection (a) of this section.
      (3) For purposes of paragraphs (1) and (2), the terms
    "correction" and "removal" do not include routine servicing.

    upon the expiration of such 18 months, the Congress finds that

    Register notice of the new status of the proposed regulations.
      "(3) Not later than November 28, 1992, the Secretary shall issue
    final regulations to implement section 519(e) of the Federal Food,
    Drug, and Cosmetic Act. If the Secretary does not promulgate such
    final regulations by November 28, 1992, the Congress finds that
    there is good cause for the proposed regulations to be considered
    as the final regulations without response to comment because the
    implementation of section 519(e) of such Act is essential to
    protect the health of patients who use devices. In such event, the
    proposed regulations issued under paragraph (1) shall become the
    issued final regulations on November 29, 1992. There shall be
    promptly published in the Federal Register notice of the new status
    of the proposed regulations."

      Any information reported to or otherwise obtained by the
    Secretary or his representative under section 360c, 360d, 360e,
    360f, 360h, 360i, or 374 of this title or under subsection (f) or
    (g) of this section which is exempt from disclosure pursuant to
    subsection (a) of section 552 of title 5 by reason of subsection
    (b)(4) of such section shall be considered confidential and shall
    not be disclosed and may not be used by the Secretary as the basis
    for the reclassification of a device from class III to class II or
    class I or as the basis for the establishment or amendment of a
    performance standard under section 360d of this title for a device
    reclassified from class III to class II, except (1) in accordance
    with subsection (h) of this section, and (2) that such information
    may be disclosed to other officers or employees concerned with
    carrying out this chapter or when relevant in any proceeding under
    this chapter (other than section 360c or 360d of this title).
    (d) Notices and findings
      Each notice of proposed rulemaking under section 360c, 360d,
    360e, 360f, 360h, or 360i of this title, or under this section, any
    other notice which is published in the Federal Register with
    respect to any other action taken under any such section and which
    states the reasons for such action, and each publication of
    findings required to be made in connection with rulemaking under
    any such section shall set forth - 
        (1) the manner in which interested persons may examine data and
      other information on which the notice or findings is based, and
        (2) the period within which interested persons may present
      their comments on the notice or findings (including the need
      therefor) orally or in writing, which period shall be at least
      sixty days but may not exceed ninety days unless the time is
      extended by the Secretary by a notice published in the Federal
      Register stating good cause therefor.
    (e) Restricted devices
      (1) The Secretary may by regulation require that a device be
    restricted to sale, distribution, or use - 
        (A) only upon the written or oral authorization of a
      practitioner licensed by law to administer or use such device, or
        (B) upon such other conditions as the Secretary may prescribe
      in such regulation,

    if, because of its potentiality for harmful effect or the
    collateral measures necessary to its use, the Secretary determines
    that there cannot otherwise be reasonable assurance of its safety
    and effectiveness. No condition prescribed under subparagraph (B)
    may restrict the use of a device to persons with specific training
    or experience in its use or to persons for use in certain
    facilities unless the Secretary determines that such a restriction
    is required for the safe and effective use of the device. No such
    condition may exclude a person from using a device solely because
    the person does not have the training or experience to make him
    eligible for certification by a certifying board recognized by the
    American Board of Medical Specialties or has not been certified by
    such a Board. A device subject to a regulation under this
    subsection is a restricted device.
      (2) The label of a restricted device shall bear such appropriate
    statements of the restrictions required by a regulation under
    paragraph (1) as the Secretary may in such regulation prescribe.
    (f) Good manufacturing practice requirements
      (1)(A) The Secretary may, in accordance with subparagraph (B),
    prescribe regulations requiring that the methods used in, and the
    facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, pre-production
    design validation (including a process to assess the performance of
    a device but not including an evaluation of the safety or
    effectiveness of a device), packing, storage, and installation of a
    device conform to current good manufacturing practice, as
    prescribed in such regulations, to assure that the device will be
    safe and effective and otherwise in compliance with this chapter.
      (B) Before the Secretary may promulgate any regulation under
    subparagraph (A) he shall - 
        (i) afford the advisory committee established under paragraph
      (3) an opportunity to submit recommendations to him with respect
      to the regulation proposed to be promulgated;
        (ii) afford opportunity for an oral hearing; and
        (iii) ensure that such regulation conforms, to the extent
      practicable, with internationally recognized standards defining
      quality systems, or parts of the standards, for medical devices.

    The Secretary shall provide the advisory committee a reasonable
    time to make its recommendation with respect to proposed
    regulations under subparagraph (A).
      (2)(A) Any person subject to any requirement prescribed by
    regulations under paragraph (1) may petition the Secretary for an
    exemption or variance from such requirement. Such a petition shall
    be submitted to the Secretary in such form and manner as he shall
    prescribe and shall - 
        (i) in the case of a petition for an exemption from a
      requirement, set forth the basis for the petitioner's
      determination that compliance with the requirement is not
      required to assure that the device will be safe and effective and
      otherwise in compliance with this chapter,
        (ii) in the case of a petition for a variance from a
      requirement, set forth the methods proposed to be used in, and
      the facilities and controls proposed to be used for, the
      manufacture, packing, storage, and installation of the device in
      lieu of the methods, facilities, and controls prescribed by the
      requirement, and
        (iii) contain such other information as the Secretary shall
      prescribe.

      (B) The Secretary may refer to the advisory committee established
    under paragraph (3) any petition submitted under subparagraph (A).
    The advisory committee shall report its recommendations to the
    Secretary with respect to a petition referred to it within sixty
    days of the date of the petition's referral. Within sixty days
    after - 
        (i) the date the petition was submitted to the Secretary under
      subparagraph (A), or
        (ii) if the petition was referred to an advisory committee, the
      expiration of the sixty-day period beginning on the date the
      petition was referred to the advisory committee,

    whichever occurs later, the Secretary shall by order either deny
    the petition or approve it.
      (C) The Secretary may approve - 
        (i) a petition for an exemption for a device from a requirement
      if he determines that compliance with such requirement is not
      required to assure that the device will be safe and effective and
      otherwise in compliance with this chapter, and
        (ii) a petition for a variance for a device from a requirement
      if he determines that the methods to be used in, and the
      facilities and controls to be used for, the manufacture, packing,
      storage, and installation of the device in lieu of the methods,
      controls, and facilities prescribed by the requirement are
      sufficient to assure that the device will be safe and effective
      and otherwise in compliance with this chapter.

    An order of the Secretary approving a petition for a variance shall
    prescribe such conditions respecting the methods used in, and the
    facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, packing,
    storage, and installation of the device to be granted the variance
    under the petition as may be necessary to assure that the device
    will be safe and effective and otherwise in compliance with this
    chapter.
      (D) After the issuance of an order under subparagraph (B)
    respecting a petition, the petitioner shall have an opportunity for
    an informal hearing on such order.
      (3) The Secretary shall establish an advisory committee for the
    purpose of advising and making recommendations to him with respect
    to regulations proposed to be promulgated under paragraph (1)(A)
    and the approval or disapproval of petitions submitted under
    paragraph (2). The advisory committee shall be composed of nine
    members as follows:
        (A) Three of the members shall be appointed from persons who
      are officers or employees of any State or local government or of
      the Federal Government.
        (B) Two of the members shall be appointed from persons who are
      representative of interests of the device manufacturing industry;
      two of the members shall be appointed from persons who are
      representative of the interests of physicians and other health
      professionals; and two of the members shall be representative of
      the interests of the general public.

    Members of the advisory committee who are not officers or employees
    of the United States, while attending conferences or meetings of
    the committee or otherwise engaged in its business, shall be
    entitled to receive compensation at rates to be fixed by the
    Secretary, which rates may not exceed the daily equivalent of the
    rate in effect for grade GS-18 of the General Schedule, for each
    day (including traveltime) they are so engaged; and while so
    serving away from their homes or regular places of business each
    member may be allowed travel expenses, including per diem in lieu
    of subsistence, as authorized by section 5703 of title 5 for
    persons in the Government service employed intermittently. The
    Secretary shall designate one of the members of the advisory
    committee to serve as its chairman. The Secretary shall furnish the
    advisory committee with clerical and other assistance. Section 14
    of the Federal Advisory Committee Act shall not apply with respect
    to the duration of the advisory committee established under this
    paragraph.
    (g) Exemption for devices for investigational use
      (1) It is the purpose of this subsection to encourage, to the
    extent consistent with the protection of the public health and
    safety and with ethical standards, the discovery and development of
    useful devices intended for human use and to that end to maintain
    optimum freedom for scientific investigators in their pursuit of
    that purpose.
      (2)(A) The Secretary shall, within the one hundred and twenty-day
    period beginning on May 28, 1976, by regulation prescribe
    procedures and conditions under which devices intended for human
    use may upon application be granted an exemption from the
    requirements of section 352, 360, 360d, 360e, 360f, 360i, or 379e
    of this title or subsection (e) or (f) of this section or from any
    combination of such requirements to permit the investigational use
    of such devices by experts qualified by scientific training and
    experience to investigate the safety and effectiveness of such
    devices.
      (B) The conditions prescribed pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall
    include the following:
        (i) A requirement that an application be submitted to the
      Secretary before an exemption may be granted and that the
      application be submitted in such form and manner as the Secretary
      shall specify.
        (ii) A requirement that the person applying for an exemption
      for a device assure the establishment and maintenance of such
      records, and the making of such reports to the Secretary of data
      obtained as a result of the investigational use of the device
      during the exemption, as the Secretary determines will enable him
      to assure compliance with such conditions, review the progress of
      the investigation, and evaluate the safety and effectiveness of
      the device.
        (iii) Such other requirements as the Secretary may determine to
      be necessary for the protection of the public health and safety.

      (C) Procedures and conditions prescribed pursuant to subparagraph
    (A) for an exemption may appropriately vary depending on (i) the
    scope and duration of clinical testing to be conducted under such
    exemption, (ii) the number of human subjects that are to be
    involved in such testing, (iii) the need to permit changes to be
    made in the device subject to the exemption during testing
    conducted in accordance with a clinical testing plan required under
    paragraph (3)(A), and (iv) whether the clinical testing of such
    device is for the purpose of developing data to obtain approval for
    the commercial distribution of such device.
      (3) Procedures and conditions prescribed pursuant to paragraph
    (2)(A) shall require, as a condition to the exemption of any device
    to be the subject of testing involving human subjects, that the
    person applying for the exemption - 
        (A) submit a plan for any proposed clinical testing of the
      device and a report of prior investigations of the device
      (including, where appropriate, tests on animals) adequate to
      justify the proposed clinical testing - 
          (i) to the local institutional review committee which has
        been established in accordance with regulations of the
        Secretary to supervise clinical testing of devices in the
        facilities where the proposed clinical testing is to be
        conducted, or
          (ii) to the Secretary, if - 
            (I) no such committee exists, or
            (II) the Secretary finds that the process of review by such
          committee is inadequate (whether or not the plan for such
          testing has been approved by such committee),

        for review for adequacy to justify the commencement of such
        testing; and, unless the plan and report are submitted to the
        Secretary, submit to the Secretary a summary of the plan and a
        report of prior investigations of the device (including, where
        appropriate, tests on animals);

        (B) promptly notify the Secretary (under such circumstances and
      in such manner as the Secretary prescribes) of approval by a
      local institutional review committee of any clinical testing plan
      submitted to it in accordance with subparagraph (A);
        (C) in the case of a device to be distributed to investigators
      for testing, obtain signed agreements from each of such
      investigators that any testing of the device involving human
      subjects will be under such investigator's supervision and in
      accordance with subparagraph (D) and submit such agreements to
      the Secretary; and
        (D) assure that informed consent will be obtained from each
      human subject (or his representative) of proposed clinical
      testing involving such device, except where subject to such
      conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, the investigator
      conducting or supervising the proposed clinical testing of the
      device determines in writing that there exists a life threatening
      situation involving the human subject of such testing which
      necessitates the use of such device and it is not feasible to
      obtain informed consent from the subject and there is not
      sufficient time to obtain such consent from his representative.

    The determination required by subparagraph (D) shall be concurred
    in by a licensed physician who is not involved in the testing of
    the human subject with respect to which such determination is made
    unless immediate use of the device is required to save the life of
    the human subject of such testing and there is not sufficient time
    to obtain such concurrence.
      (4)(A) An application, submitted in accordance with the
    procedures prescribed by regulations under paragraph (2), for an
    exemption for a device (other than an exemption from section 360f
    of this title) shall be deemed approved on the thirtieth day after
    the submission of the application to the Secretary unless on or
    before such day the Secretary by order disapproves the application
    and notifies the applicant of the disapproval of the application.
      (B) The Secretary may disapprove an application only if he finds
    that the investigation with respect to which the application is
    submitted does not conform to procedures and conditions prescribed
    under regulations under paragraph (2). Such a notification shall
    contain the order of disapproval and a complete statement of the
    reasons for the Secretary's disapproval of the application and
    afford the applicant opportunity for an informal hearing on the
    disapproval order.
      (5) The Secretary may by order withdraw an exemption granted
    under this subsection for a device if the Secretary determines that
    the conditions applicable to the device under this subsection for
    such exemption are not met. Such an order may be issued only after
    opportunity for an informal hearing, except that such an order may
    be issued before the provision of an opportunity for an informal
    hearing if the Secretary determines that the continuation of
    testing under the exemption with respect to which the order is to
    be issued will result in an unreasonable risk to the public health.
      (6)(A) Not later than 1 year after November 21, 1997, the
    Secretary shall by regulation establish, with respect to a device
    for which an exemption under this subsection is in effect,
    procedures and conditions that, without requiring an additional
    approval of an application for an exemption or the approval of a
    supplement to such an application, permit - 
        (i) developmental changes in the device (including
      manufacturing changes) that do not constitute a significant
      change in design or in basic principles of operation and that are
      made in response to information gathered during the course of an
      investigation; and
        (ii) changes or modifications to clinical protocols that do not
      affect - 
          (I) the validity of data or information resulting from the
        completion of an approved protocol, or the relationship of
        likely patient risk to benefit relied upon to approve a
        protocol;
          (II) the scientific soundness of an investigational plan
        submitted under paragraph (3)(A); or
          (III) the rights, safety, or welfare of the human subjects
        involved in the investigation.

      (B) Regulations under subparagraph (A) shall provide that a
    change or modification described in such subparagraph may be made
    if - 
        (i) the sponsor of the investigation determines, on the basis
      of credible information (as defined by the Secretary) that the
      applicable conditions under subparagraph (A) are met; and
        (ii) the sponsor submits to the Secretary, not later than 5
      days after making the change or modification, a notice of the
      change or modification.

      (7)(A) In the case of a person intending to investigate the
    safety or effectiveness of a class III device or any implantable
    device, the Secretary shall ensure that the person has an
    opportunity, prior to submitting an application to the Secretary or
    to an institutional review committee, to submit to the Secretary,
    for review, an investigational plan (including a clinical
    protocol). If the applicant submits a written request for a meeting
    with the Secretary regarding such review, the Secretary shall, not
    later than 30 days after receiving the request, meet with the
    applicant for the purpose of reaching agreement regarding the
    investigational plan (including a clinical protocol). The written
    request shall include a detailed description of the device, a
    detailed description of the proposed conditions of use of the
    device, a proposed plan (including a clinical protocol) for
    determining whether there is a reasonable assurance of
    effectiveness, and, if available, information regarding the
    expected performance from the device.
      (B) Any agreement regarding the parameters of an investigational
    plan (including a clinical protocol) that is reached between the
    Secretary and a sponsor or applicant shall be reduced to writing
    and made part of the administrative record by the Secretary. Any
    such agreement shall not be changed, except - 
        (i) with the written agreement of the sponsor or applicant; or
        (ii) pursuant to a decision, made in accordance with
      subparagraph (C) by the director of the office in which the
      device involved is reviewed, that a substantial scientific issue
      essential to determining the safety or effectiveness of the
      device involved has been identified.

      (C) A decision under subparagraph (B)(ii) by the director shall
    be in writing, and may be made only after the Secretary has
    provided to the sponsor or applicant an opportunity for a meeting
    at which the director and the sponsor or applicant are present and
    at which the director documents the scientific issue involved.

      title,

    is classified in class III unless the Secretary in response to a
    petition submitted under paragraph (2) has classified such device
    in class I or II.
      (2) The Secretary may initiate the reclassification of a device
    classified into class III under paragraph (1) of this subsection or
    the manufacturer or importer of a device classified under paragraph
    (1) may petition the Secretary (in such form and manner as he shall
    prescribe) for the issuance of an order classifying the device in
    class I or class II. Within thirty days of the filing of such a

      title, and
        (ii) the requirements applicable to such device before the
      enactment date under section 355 of this title shall continue to
      apply to such device until changed by the Secretary as authorized
      by this chapter.

      (B) In the case of a device which is described in paragraph
    (1)(B) and which is in class III, an application for such device
    shall be considered as having been filed under section 360e of this
    title on the enactment date. The period in which the Secretary
    shall act on such application in accordance with section 360e(d)(1)
    of this title shall be one hundred and eighty days from the
    enactment date (or such greater period as the Secretary and the
    applicant may agree upon after the Secretary has made the finding
    required by section 360e(d)(1)(B)(i) of this title) less the number
    of days in the period beginning on the date an application for such
    device was filed under section 355 of this title and ending on the
    enactment date. After the expiration of such period such device is
    required, unless exempt under subsection (g) of this section, to
    have in effect an approved application under section 360e of this
    title.
      (C) A device which is described in paragraph (1)(C) and which is
    in class III shall be considered a new drug until the expiration of
    the ninety-day period beginning on the date of the promulgation of
    regulations under subsection (g) of this section. After the
    expiration of such period such device is required, unless exempt
    under subsection (g) of this section, to have in effect an approved
    application under section 360e of this title.
      (D)(i) Except as provided in clauses (ii) and (iii), a device
    which is described in subparagraph (D), (E), or (F) of paragraph
    (1) and which is in class III is required, unless exempt under
    subsection (g) of this section, to have on and after sixty days
    after the enactment date in effect an approved application under
    section 360e of this title.
      (ii) If - 
        (I) a petition is filed under paragraph (2) for a device
      described in subparagraph (D), (E), or (F) of paragraph (1), or
        (II) an application for premarket approval is filed under
      section 360e of this title for such a device,

    within the sixty-day period beginning on the enactment date (or
    within such greater period as the Secretary, after making the
    finding required under section 360e(d)(1)(B) of this title, and the
    petitioner or applicant may agree upon), the Secretary shall act on
    such petition or application in accordance with paragraph (2) or
    section 360e of this title except that the period within which the
    Secretary must act on the petition or application shall be within
    the one hundred and twenty-day period beginning on the date the
    petition or application is filed. If such a petition or application
    is filed within such sixty-day (or greater) period, clause (i) of
    this subparagraph shall not apply to such device before the
    expiration of such one hundred and twenty-day period, or if such
    petition is denied or such application is denied approval, before
    the date of such denial, whichever occurs first.
      (iii) In the case of a device which is described in subparagraph
    (E) of paragraph (1), which the Secretary in a notice published in
    the Federal Register after March 31, 1976, declared to be a new
    drug subject to section 355 of this title, and which is in class
    III - 
        (I) the device shall, after eighteen months after the enactment
      date, have in effect an approved application under section 360e
      of this title unless exempt under subsection (g) of this section,
      and
        (II) the Secretary may, during the period beginning one hundred
      and eighty days after the enactment date and ending eighteen
      months after such date, restrict the use of the device to
      investigational use by experts qualified by scientific training
      and experience to investigate the safety and effectiveness of
      such device, and to investigational use in accordance with the
      requirements applicable under regulations under subsection (g) of
      this section to investigational use of devices granted an
      exemption under such subsection.

    If the requirements under subsection (g) of this section are made
    applicable to the investigational use of such a device, they shall
    be made applicable in such a manner that the device shall be made
    reasonably available to physicians meeting appropriate
    qualifications prescribed by the Secretary.
      (4) Repealed. Pub. L. 105-115, title I, Sec. 125(b)(2)(E), Nov.
    21, 1997, 111 Stat. 2325.
      (5)(A) Before December 1, 1991, the Secretary shall by order
    require manufacturers of devices described in paragraph (1), which
    are subject to revision of classification under subparagraph (B),
    to submit to the Secretary a summary of and citation to any
    information known or otherwise available to the manufacturers
    respecting the devices, including adverse safety or effectiveness
    information which has not been submitted under section 360i of this
    title. The Secretary may require a manufacturer to submit the
    adverse safety or effectiveness data for which a summary and
    citation were submitted, if such data are available to the
    manufacturer.
      (B) Except as provided in subparagraph (C), after the issuance of
    an order under subparagraph (A) but before December 1, 1992, the
    Secretary shall publish a regulation in the Federal Register for
    each device which is classified in class III under paragraph (1)
    revising the classification of the device so that the device is
    classified into class I or class II, unless the regulation requires
    the device to remain in class III. In determining whether to revise
    the classification of a device or to require a device to remain in
    class III, the Secretary shall apply the criteria set forth in
    section 360c(a) of this title. Before the publication of a
    regulation requiring a device to remain in class III or revising
    its classification, the Secretary shall publish a proposed
    regulation respecting the classification of a device under this
    subparagraph and provide an opportunity for the submission of
    comments on any such regulation. No regulation under this
    subparagraph requiring a device to remain in class III or revising
    its classification may take effect before the expiration of 90 days
    from the date of the publication in the Federal Register of the
    proposed regulation.
      (C) The Secretary may by notice published in the Federal Register
    extend the period prescribed by subparagraph (B) for a device for
    an additional period not to exceed 1 year.
    (m) Humanitarian device exemption
      (1) To the extent consistent with the protection of the public
    health and safety and with ethical standards, it is the purpose of
    this subsection to encourage the discovery and use of devices
    intended to benefit patients in the treatment and diagnosis of
    diseases or conditions that affect fewer than 4,000 individuals in
    the United States.
      (2) The Secretary may grant a request for an exemption from the
    effectiveness requirements of sections 360d and 360e of this title
    for a device for which the Secretary finds that - 
        (A) the device is designed to treat or diagnose a disease or
      condition that affects fewer than 4,000 individuals in the United
      States,
        (B) the device would not be available to a person with a
      disease or condition referred to in subparagraph (A) unless the
      Secretary grants such an exemption and there is no comparable
      device, other than under this exemption, available to treat or
      diagnose such disease or condition, and
        (C) the device will not expose patients to an unreasonable or
      significant risk of illness or injury and the probable benefit to
      health from the use of the device outweighs the risk of injury or
      illness from its use, taking into account the probable risks and
      benefits of currently available devices or alternative forms of
      treatment.

    The request shall be in the form of an application submitted to the
    Secretary. Not later than 75 days after the date of the receipt of
    the application, the Secretary shall issue an order approving or
    denying the application.
      (3) No person granted an exemption under paragraph (2) with
    respect to a device may sell the device for an amount that exceeds
    the costs of research and development, fabrication, and
    distribution of the device.
      (4) Devices granted an exemption under paragraph (2) may only be
    used - 
        (A) in facilities that have established, in accordance with
      regulations of the Secretary, a local institutional review
      committee to supervise clinical testing of devices in the
      facilities, and
        (B) if, before the use of a device, an institutional review
      committee approves the use in the treatment or diagnosis of a
      disease or condition referred to in paragraph (2)(A), unless a
      physician determines in an emergency situation that approval from
      a local institutional review committee can not be obtained in
      time to prevent serious harm or death to a patient.

    In a case described in subparagraph (B) in which a physician uses a
    device without an approval from an institutional review committee,
    the physician shall, after the use of the device, notify the
    chairperson of the local institutional review committee of such
    use. Such notification shall include the identification of the
    patient involved, the date on which the device was used, and the
    reason for the use.
      (5) The Secretary may require a person granted an exemption under
    paragraph (2) to demonstrate continued compliance with the
    requirements of this subsection if the Secretary believes such
    demonstration to be necessary to protect the public health or if
    the Secretary has reason to believe that the criteria for the
    exemption are no longer met.
      (6) The Secretary may suspend or withdraw an exemption from the
    effectiveness requirements of sections 360d and 360e of this title
    for a humanitarian device only after providing notice and an
    opportunity for an informal hearing.
    (n) Regulation of contact lenses as devices
      (1) All contact lenses shall be deemed to be devices under
    section 321(h) of this title.
      (2) Paragraph (1) shall not be construed as bearing on or being
    relevant to the question of whether any product other than a
    contact lens is a device as defined by section 321(h) of this title
    or a drug as defined by section 321(g) of this title.

    (a) General rule
      Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, no State or
    political subdivision of a State may establish or continue in
    effect with respect to a device intended for human use any
    requirement - 
        (1) which is different from, or in addition to, any requirement
      applicable under this chapter to the device, and

      or to any other matter included in a requirement applicable to
      the device under this chapter.
    (b) Exempt requirements
      Upon application of a State or a political subdivision thereof,
    the Secretary may, by regulation promulgated after notice and
    opportunity for an oral hearing, exempt from subsection (a) of this
    section, under such conditions as may be prescribed in such
    regulation, a requirement of such State or political subdivision
    applicable to a device intended for human use if - 
        (1) the requirement is more stringent than a requirement under
      this chapter which would be applicable to the device if an
      exemption were not in effect under this subsection; or
        (2) the requirement - 
          (A) is required by compelling local conditions, and
          (B) compliance with the requirement would not cause the

    Sec. 360l. Postmarket surveillance

-STATUTE-
    (a) In general
      The Secretary may by order require a manufacturer to conduct
    postmarket surveillance for any device of the manufacturer which is
    a class II or class III device the failure of which would be
    reasonably likely to have serious adverse health consequences or
    which is intended to be - 
        (1) implanted in the human body for more than one year, or
        (2) a life sustaining or life supporting device used outside a
      device user facility.
    (b) Surveillance approval
      Each manufacturer required to conduct a surveillance of a device
    shall, within 30 days of receiving an order from the Secretary
    prescribing that the manufacturer is required under this section to
    conduct such surveillance, submit, for the approval of the
    Secretary, a plan for the required surveillance. The Secretary,
    within 60 days of the receipt of such plan, shall determine if the
    person designated to conduct the surveillance has appropriate
    qualifications and experience to undertake such surveillance and if
    the plan will result in the collection of useful data that can
    reveal unforeseen adverse events or other information necessary to
    protect the public health. The Secretary, in consultation with the
    manufacturer, may by order require a prospective surveillance
    period of up to 36 months. Any determination by the Secretary that
    a longer period is necessary shall be made by mutual agreement
    between the Secretary and the manufacturer or, if no agreement can
    be reached, after the completion of a dispute resolution process as
    described in section 360bbb-1 of this title.

    STUDY BY INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE OF POSTMARKET SURVEILLANCE REGARDING
                           PEDIATRIC POPULATIONS
      Pub. L. 107-250, title II, Sec. 212, Oct. 26, 2002, 116 Stat.
    1614, as amended by Pub. L. 108-214, Sec. 2(d)(3)(C), Apr. 1, 2004,
    118 Stat. 577, provided that:
      "(a) In General. - The Secretary of Health and Human Services
    (referred to in this section as the 'Secretary') shall request the
    Institute of Medicine to enter into an agreement with the Secretary
    under which such Institute conducts a study for the purpose of
    determining whether the system under the Federal Food, Drug, and
    Cosmetic Act [21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.] for the postmarket
    surveillance of medical devices provides adequate safeguards
    regarding the use of devices in pediatric populations.
      "(b) Certain Matters. - The Secretary shall ensure that
    determinations made in the study under subsection (a) include
    determinations of - 
        "(1) whether postmarket surveillance studies of implanted
      medical devices are of long enough duration to evaluate the
      impact of growth and development for the number of years that the
      child will have the implant, and whether the studies are adequate
      to evaluate how children's active lifestyles may affect the
      failure rate and longevity of the implant; and
        "(2) whether the postmarket surveillance by the Food and Drug
      Administration of medical devices used in pediatric populations
      is sufficient to provide adequate safeguards for such
      populations, taking into account the Secretary's monitoring of
      commitments made at the time of approval of medical devices and
      the Secretary's monitoring and use of adverse reaction reports,
      registries, and other postmarket surveillance activities.
      "(c) Report to Congress. - The Secretary shall ensure that, not
    later than four years after the date of the enactment of this Act
    [Oct. 26, 2002], a report describing the findings of the study
    under subsection (a) is submitted to the Congress. The report shall
    include any recommendations of the Secretary for administrative or
    legislative changes to the system of postmarket surveillance
    referred to in such subsection."

      Pub. L. 100-290, Sec. 3(d), Apr. 18, 1988, 102 Stat. 91, directed
    Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct a study to
    determine whether the application of subchapter B of chapter V of
    the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 360aa et seq.
    (relating to drugs for rare diseases and conditions), and 26 U.S.C.
    28 (relating to tax credit) to medical devices or medical foods for
    rare diseases or conditions or to both was needed to encourage
    development of such devices and foods and report results of the
    study to Congress not later than one year after Apr. 18, 1988.

                          CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS                      
      Section 1(b) of Pub. L. 97-414 provided that: "The Congress finds
    that - 
        "(1) there are many diseases and conditions, such as
      Huntington's disease, myoclonus, ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease),
      Tourette syndrome, and muscular dystrophy which affect such small
      numbers of individuals residing in the United States that the
      diseases and conditions are considered rare in the United States;
        "(2) adequate drugs for many of such diseases and conditions
      have not been developed;
        "(3) drugs for these diseases and conditions are commonly
      referred to as 'orphan drugs';
        "(4) because so few individuals are affected by any one rare
      disease or condition, a pharmaceutical company which develops an
      orphan drug may reasonably expect the drug to generate relatively
      small sales in comparison to the cost of developing the drug and
      consequently to incur a financial loss;
        "(5) there is reason to believe that some promising orphan
      drugs will not be developed unless changes are made in the
      applicable Federal laws to reduce the costs of developing such
      drugs and to provide financial incentives to develop such drugs;
      and
        "(6) it is in the public interest to provide such changes and
      incentives for the development of orphan drugs."

-STATUTE-
    (a) Request by sponsor; preconditions; "rare disease or condition"
      defined
      (1) The manufacturer or the sponsor of a drug may request the
    Secretary to designate the drug as a drug for a rare disease or
    condition. A request for designation of a drug shall be made before
    the submission of an application under section 355(b) of this title
    for the drug, or the submission of an application for licensing of
    the drug under section 262 of title 42. If the Secretary finds that
    a drug for which a request is submitted under this subsection is
    being or will be investigated for a rare disease or condition and -
    
        (A) if an application for such drug is approved under section
      355 of this title, or
        (B) if a license for such drug is issued under section 262 of
      title 42,

    the approval, certification, or license would be for use for such
    disease or condition, the Secretary shall designate the drug as a
    drug for such disease or condition. A request for a designation of
    a drug under this subsection shall contain the consent of the
    applicant to notice being given by the Secretary under subsection
    (b) of this section respecting the designation of the drug.
      (2) For purposes of paragraph (1), the term "rare disease or
    condition" means any disease or condition which (A) affects less
    than 200,000 persons in the United States, or (B) affects more than
    200,000 in the United States and for which there is no reasonable
    expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the
    United States a drug for such disease or condition will be
    recovered from sales in the United States of such drug.
    Determinations under the preceding sentence with respect to any
    drug shall be made on the basis of the facts and circumstances as
    of the date the request for designation of the drug under this
    subsection is made.
    (b) Notification of discontinuance of drug or application as
      condition
      A designation of a drug under subsection (a) of this section
    shall be subject to the condition that - 
        (1) if an application was approved for the drug under section
      355(b) of this title or a license was issued for the drug under
      section 262 of title 42, the manufacturer of the drug will notify
      the Secretary of any discontinuance of the production of the drug
      at least one year before discontinuance, and
        (2) if an application has not been approved for the drug under
      section 355(b) of this title or a license has not been issued for
      the drug under section 262 of title 42 and if preclinical
      investigations or investigations under section 355(i) of this
      title are being conducted with the drug, the manufacturer or
      sponsor of the drug will notify the Secretary of any decision to
      discontinue active pursuit of approval of an application under
      section 355(b) of this title or approval of a license under
      section 262 of title 42.
    (c) Notice to public
      Notice respecting the designation of a drug under subsection (a)
    of this section shall be made available to the public.
    (d) Regulations
      The Secretary shall by regulation promulgate procedures for the
    implementation of subsection (a) of this section.

      200,000 persons in the United States, or (B) affects more than
      200,000 in the United States and for which there is no reasonable
      expectation that the cost of developing and making available in
      the United States a drug for such disease or condition will be
      recovered from sales in the United States of such drug, (2) in
      the case of a medical device, any disease or condition that
      occurs so infrequently in the United States that there is no
      reasonable expectation that a medical device for such disease or
      condition will be developed without assistance under subsection
      (a) of this section, and (3) in the case of a medical food, any
      disease or condition that occurs so infrequently in the United
      States that there is no reasonable expectation that a medical
      food for such disease or condition will be developed without
      assistance under subsection (a) of this section. Determinations
      under the preceding sentence with respect to any drug shall be
      made on the basis of the facts and circumstances as of the date

                     EFFECTIVE DATE OF 1985 AMENDMENT                 
      Amendment by Pub. L. 99-91 effective Oct. 1, 1985, see section
    8(a) of Pub. L. 99-91, set out as a note under section 360aa of
    this title.

                           FINDINGS AND PURPOSES                       
      Pub. L. 107-281, Sec. 2, Nov. 6, 2002, 116 Stat. 1992, provided
    that:
      "(a) Findings. - Congress makes the following findings:
        "(1) Rare diseases and disorders are those which affect small
      patient populations, typically populations smaller than 200,000
      individuals in the United States. Such diseases and conditions
      include Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou
      Gehrig's disease), Tourette syndrome, Crohn's disease, cystic
      fibrosis, cystinosis, and Duchenne muscular dystrophy.
        "(2) For many years, the 25,000,000 Americans suffering from
      the over 6,000 rare diseases and disorders were denied access to
      effective medicines because prescription drug manufacturers could
      rarely make a profit from marketing drugs for such small groups
      of patients. The prescription drug industry did not adequately
      fund research into such treatments. Despite the urgent health
      need for these medicines, they came to be known as 'orphan drugs'
      because no companies would commercialize them.
        "(3) During the 1970s, an organization called the National
      Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) was founded to provide
      services and to lobby on behalf of patients with rare diseases
      and disorders. NORD was instrumental in pressing Congress for
      legislation to encourage the development of orphan drugs.
        "(4) The Orphan Drug Act [see Short Title of 1983 Amendments
      note set out under section 301 of this title] created financial
      incentives for the research and production of such orphan drugs.
      New Federal programs at the National Institutes of Health and the
      Food and Drug Administration encouraged clinical research and
      commercial product development for products that target rare
      diseases. An Orphan Products Board was established to promote the
      development of drugs and devices for rare diseases or disorders.
        "(5) Before 1983, some 38 orphan drugs had been developed.
      Since the enactment of the Orphan Drug Act [Jan. 4, 1983], more
      than 220 new orphan drugs have been approved and marketed in the
      United States and more than 800 additional drugs are in the
      research pipeline.
        "(6) Despite the tremendous success of the Orphan Drug Act,
      rare diseases and disorders deserve greater emphasis in the
      national biomedical research enterprise.
        "(7) The Food and Drug Administration supports small clinical
      trials through Orphan Products Research Grants. Such grants
      embody successful partnerships of government and industry, and
      have led to the development of at least 23 drugs and four medical
      devices for rare diseases and disorders. Yet the appropriations
      in fiscal year 2001 for such grants were less than in fiscal year
      1995.
      "(b) Purposes. - The purpose of this Act [see Short Title of 2002
    Amendments note set out under section 301 of this title] is to
    increase the national investment in the development of diagnostics
    and treatments for patients with rare diseases and disorders."

-HEAD-
    Sec. 360kk. Performance standards for electronic products

-STATUTE-
    (a) Promulgation of regulations
      (1) The Secretary shall by regulation prescribe performance
    standards for electronic products to control the emission of
    electronic product radiation from such products if he determines
    that such standards are necessary for the protection of the public
    health and safety. Such standards may include provisions for the
    testing of such products and the measurement of their electronic
    product radiation emissions, may require the attachment of warning
    signs and labels, and may require the provision of instructions for
    the installation, operation, and use of such products. Such
    standards may be prescribed from time to time whenever such
    determinations are made, but the first of such standards shall be
    prescribed prior to January 1, 1970. In the development of such
    standards, the Secretary shall consult with Federal and State
    departments and agencies having related responsibilities or
    interests and with appropriate professional organizations and
    interested persons, including representatives of industries and
    labor organizations which would be affected by such standards, and
    shall give consideration to - 
        (A) the latest available scientific and medical data in the
      field of electronic product radiation;
        (B) the standards currently recommended by (i) other Federal
      agencies having responsibilities relating to the control and
      measurement of electronic product radiation, and (ii) public or
      private groups having an expertise in the field of electronic
      product radiation;
        (C) the reasonableness and technical feasibility of such
      standards as applied to a particular electronic product;
        (D) the adaptability of such standards to the need for
      uniformity and reliability of testing and measuring procedures
      and equipment; and
        (E) in the case of a component, or accessory described in
      paragraph (2)(B) of section 360hh of this title, the performance
      of such article in the manufactured or assembled product for
      which it is designed.

      (2) The Secretary may prescribe different and individual
    performance standards, to the extent appropriate and feasible, for
    different electronic products so as to recognize their different
    operating characteristics and uses.
      (3) The performance standards prescribed under this section shall
    not apply to any electronic product which is intended solely for
    export if (A) such product and the outside of any shipping
    container used in the export of such product are labeled or tagged
    to show that such product is intended for export, and (B) such
    product meets all the applicable requirements of the country to
    which such product is intended for export.
      (4) The Secretary may by regulation amend or revoke any
    performance standard prescribed under this section.
      (5) The Secretary may exempt from the provisions of this section
    any electronic product intended for use by departments or agencies
    of the United States provided such department or agency has
    prescribed procurement specifications governing emissions of
    electronic product radiation and provided further that such product
    is of a type used solely or predominantly by departments or
    agencies of the United States.
    (b) Administrative procedure
      The provisions of subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5 (relating
    to the administrative procedure for rulemaking), and of chapter 7
    of title 5 (relating to judicial review), shall apply with respect
    to any regulation prescribing, amending, or revoking any standard
    prescribed under this section.
    (c) Publication in Federal Register
      Each regulation prescribing, amending, or revoking a standard
    shall specify the date on which it shall take effect which, in the
    case of any regulation prescribing, or amending any standard, may
    not be sooner than one year or not later than two years after the
    date on which such regulation is issued, unless the Secretary
    finds, for good cause shown, that an earlier or later effective
    date is in the public interest and publishes in the Federal
    Register his reason for such finding, in which case such earlier or
    later date shall apply.
    (d) Judicial review
      (1) In a case of actual controversy as to the validity of any
    regulation issued under this section prescribing, amending, or
    revoking a performance standard, any person who will be adversely
    affected by such regulation when it is effective may at any time
    prior to the sixtieth day after such regulation is issued file a
    petition with the United States court of appeals for the circuit
    wherein such person resides or has his principal place of business,
    for a judicial review of such regulation. A copy of the petition
    shall be forthwith transmitted by the clerk of the court to the
    Secretary or other officer designated by him for that purpose. The
    Secretary thereupon shall file in the court the record of the
    proceedings on which the Secretary based the regulation, as
    provided in section 2112 of title 28.
      (2) If the petitioner applies to the court for leave to adduce
    additional evidence, and shows to the satisfaction of the court
    that such additional evidence is material and that there were
    reasonable grounds for the failure to adduce such evidence in the
    proceeding before the Secretary, the court may order such
    additional evidence (and evidence in rebuttal thereof) to be taken
    before the Secretary, and to be adduced upon the hearing, in such
    manner and upon such terms and conditions as to the court may seem
    proper. The Secretary may modify his findings, or make new
    findings, by reason of the additional evidence so taken, and he
    shall file such modified or new findings, and his recommendations,
    if any, for the modification or setting aside of his original
    regulation, with the return of such additional evidence.
      (3) Upon the filing of the petition referred to in paragraph (1)
    of this subsection, the court shall have jurisdiction to review the
    regulation in accordance with chapter 7 of title 5 and to grant
    appropriate relief as provided in such chapter.
      (4) The judgment of the court affirming or setting aside, in
    whole or in part, any such regulation of the Secretary shall be
    final, subject to review by the Supreme Court of the United States
    upon certiorari or certification as provided in section 1254 of
    title 28.
      (5) Any action instituted under this subsection shall survive,
    notwithstanding any change in the person occupying the office of
    Secretary or any vacancy in such office.
      (6) The remedies provided for in this subsection shall be in
    addition to and not in substitution for any other remedies provided
    by law.
    (e) Availability of record
      A certified copy of the transcript of the record and
    administrative proceedings under this section shall be furnished by
    the Secretary to any interested party at his request, and payment
    of the costs thereof, and shall be admissible in any criminal,
    exclusion of imports, or other proceeding arising under or in
    respect of this part irrespective of whether proceedings with
    respect to the regulation have previously been initiated or become
    final under this section.
    (f) Technical Electronic Product Radiation Safety Standards
      Committee
      (1)(A) The Secretary shall establish a Technical Electronic
    Product Radiation Safety Standards Committee (hereafter in this
    part referred to as the "Committee") which he shall consult before
    prescribing any standard under this section. The Committee shall be
    appointed by the Secretary, after consultation with public and
    private agencies concerned with the technical aspect of electronic
    product radiation safety, and shall be composed of fifteen members
    each of whom shall be technically qualified by training and
    experience in one or more fields of science or engineering
    applicable to electronic product radiation safety, as follows:
        (i) Five members shall be selected from governmental agencies,
      including State and Federal Governments;
        (ii) Five members shall be selected from the affected
      industries after consultation with industry representatives; and
        (iii) Five members shall be selected from the general public,
      of which at least one shall be a representative of organized
      labor.

      (B) The Committee may propose electronic product radiation safety
    standards to the Secretary for his consideration. All proceedings
    of the Committee shall be recorded and the record of each such
    proceeding shall be available for public inspection.
      (2) Payments to members of the Committee who are not officers or
    employees of the United States pursuant to subsection (c) of
    section 210 of title 42 shall not render members of the Committee
    officers or employees of the United States for any purpose.
    (g) Review and evaluation
      The Secretary shall review and evaluate on a continuing basis
    testing programs carried out by industry to assure the adequacy of
    safeguards against hazardous electronic product radiation and to
    assure that electronic products comply with standards prescribed
    under this section.
    (h) Product certification
      Every manufacturer of an electronic product to which is
    applicable a standard in effect under this section shall furnish to
    the distributor or dealer at the time of delivery of such product,
    in the form of a label or tag permanently affixed to such product
    or in such manner as approved by the Secretary, the certification
    that such product conforms to all applicable standards under this
    section. Such certification shall be based upon a test, in
    accordance with such standard, of the individual article to which
    it is attached or upon a testing program which is in accord with
    good manufacturing practice and which has not been disapproved by
    the Secretary (in such manner as he shall prescribe by regulation)
    on the grounds that it does not assure the adequacy of safeguards
    against hazardous electronic product radiation or that it does not
    assure that electronic products comply with the standards
    prescribed under this section.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Notification; exemption
      (1) Every manufacturer of electronic products who discovers that
    an electronic product produced, assembled, or imported by him has a
    defect which relates to the safety of use of such product by reason
    of the emission of electronic product radiation, or that an
    electronic product produced, assembled, or imported by him on or
    after the effective date of an applicable standard prescribed
    pursuant to section 360kk of this title fails to comply with such
    standard, shall immediately notify the Secretary of such defect or
    failure to comply if such product has left the place of manufacture
    and shall (except as authorized by paragraph (2)) with reasonable
    promptness furnish notification of such defect or failure to the
    persons (where known to the manufacturer) specified in subsection
    (b) of this section.
      (2) If, in the opinion of such manufacturer, the defect or
    failure to comply is not such as to create a significant risk of
    injury, including genetic injury, to any person, he may, at the
    time of giving notice to the Secretary of such defect or failure to
    comply, apply to the Secretary for an exemption from the
    requirement of notice to the persons specified in subsection (b) of
    this section. If such application states reasonable grounds for
    such exemption, the Secretary shall afford such manufacturer an
    opportunity to present his views and evidence in support of the
    application, the burden of proof being on the manufacturer. If,
    after such presentation, the Secretary is satisfied that such
    defect or failure to comply is not such as to create a significant
    risk of injury, including genetic injury, to any person, he shall
    exempt such manufacturer from the requirement of notice to the
    persons specified in subsection (b) of this section and from the
    requirements of repair or replacement imposed by subsection (f) of
    this section.
    (b) Method of notification
      The notification (other than to the Secretary) required by
    paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of this section shall be
    accomplished - 
        (1) by certified mail to the first purchaser of such product
      for purposes other than resale, and to any subsequent transferee
      of such product; and
        (2) by certified mail or other more expeditious means to the
      dealers or distributors of such manufacturer to whom such product
      was delivered.
    (c) Requisite elements of notification
      The notifications required by paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of
    this section shall contain a clear description of such defect or
    failure to comply with an applicable standard, an evaluation of the
    hazard reasonably related to such defect or failure to comply, and
    a statement of the measures to be taken to repair such defect. In
    the case of a notification to a person referred to in subsection
    (b) of this section, the notification shall also advise the person
    of his rights under subsection (f) of this section.
    (d) Copies to Secretary of communications by manufacturers to
      dealers or distributors regarding defects
      Every manufacturer of electronic products shall furnish to the
    Secretary a true or representative copy of all notices, bulletins,
    and other communications to the dealers or distributors of such
    manufacturer or to purchasers (or subsequent transferees) of
    electronic products of such manufacturer regarding any such defect
    in such product or any such failure to comply with a standard
    applicable to such product. The Secretary shall disclose to the
    public so much of the information contained in such notice or other
    information obtained under section 360nn of this title as he deems
    will assist in carrying out the purposes of this part, but he shall
    not disclose any information which contains or relates to a trade
    secret or other matter referred to in section 1905 of title 18
    unless he determines that it is necessary to carry out the purposes
    of this part.
    (e) Notice from Secretary to manufacturer of defects or failure to
      comply with standards
      If through testing, inspection, investigation, or research
    carried out pursuant to this part, or examination of reports
    submitted pursuant to section 360nn of this title, or otherwise,
    the Secretary determines that any electronic product - 
        (1) does not comply with an applicable standard prescribed
      pursuant to section 360kk of this title; or
        (2) contains a defect which relates to the safety of use of
      such product by reason of the emission of electronic product
      radiation;

    he shall immediately notify the manufacturer of such product of
    such defect or failure to comply. The notice shall contain the
    findings of the Secretary and shall include all information upon
    which the findings are based. The Secretary shall afford such
    manufacturer an opportunity to present his views and evidence in
    support thereof, to establish that there is no failure of
    compliance or that the alleged defect does not exist or does not
    relate to safety of use of the product by reason of the emission of
    such radiation hazard. If after such presentation by the
    manufacturer the Secretary determines that such product does not
    comply with an applicable standard prescribed pursuant to section
    360kk of this title, or that it contains a defect which relates to
    the safety of use of such product by reason of the emission of
    electronic product radiation, the Secretary shall direct the
    manufacturer to furnish the notification specified in subsection
    (c) of this section to the persons specified in paragraphs (1) and
    (2) of subsection (b) of this section (where known to the
    manufacturer), unless the manufacturer has applied for an exemption
    from the requirement of such notification on the ground specified
    in paragraph (2) of subsection (a) of this section and the
    Secretary is satisfied that such noncompliance or defect is not
    such as to create a significant risk of injury, including genetic
    injury, to any person.
    (f) Correction of defects
      If any electronic product is found under subsection (a) or (e) of
    this section to fail to comply with an applicable standard
    prescribed under this part or to have a defect which relates to the
    safety of use of such product, and the notification specified in
    subsection (c) of this section is required to be furnished on
    account of such failure or defect, the manufacturer of such product
    shall (1) without charge, bring such product into conformity with
    such standard or remedy such defect and provide reimbursement for
    any expenses for transportation of such product incurred in
    connection with having such product brought into conformity or
    having such defect remedied, (2) replace such product with a like
    or equivalent product which complies with each applicable standard
    prescribed under this part and which has no defect relating to the
    safety of its use, or (3) make a refund of the cost of such
    product. The manufacturer shall take the action required by this
    subsection in such manner, and with respect to such persons, as the
    Secretary by regulations shall prescribe.
    (g) Effective date
      This section shall not apply to any electronic product that was
    manufactured before October 18, 1968.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Refusal of admission to noncomplying electronic products
      Any electronic product offered for importation into the United
    States which fails to comply with an applicable standard prescribed
    under this part, or to which is not affixed a certification in the
    form of a label or tag in conformity with section 360kk(h) of this
    title shall be refused admission into the United States. The
    Secretary of the Treasury shall deliver to the Secretary of Health
    and Human Services, upon the latter's request, samples of
    electronic products which are being imported or offered for import
    into the United States, giving notice thereof to the owner or
    consignee, who may have a hearing before the Secretary of Health
    and Human Services. If it appears from an examination of such
    samples or otherwise that any electronic product fails to comply
    with applicable standards prescribed pursuant to section 360kk of
    this title, then, unless subsection (b) of this section applies and
    is complied with, (1) such electronic product shall be refused
    admission, and (2) the Secretary of the Treasury shall cause the
    destruction of such electronic product unless such article is
    exported, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the
    Treasury, within 90 days after the date of notice of refusal of
    admission or within such additional time as may be permitted by
    such regulations.
    (b) Bond
      If it appears to the Secretary of Health and Human Services that
    any electronic product refused admission pursuant to subsection (a)
    of this section can be brought into compliance with applicable
    standards prescribed pursuant to section 360kk of this title, final
    determination as to admission of such electronic product may be
    deferred upon filing of timely written application by the owner or
    consignee and the execution by him of a good and sufficient bond
    providing for the payment of such liquidated damages in the event
    of default as the Secretary of Health and Human Services may by
    regulation prescribe. If such application is filed and such bond is
    executed the Secretary of Health and Human Services may, in
    accordance with rules prescribed by him, permit the applicant to
    perform such operations with respect to such electronic product as
    may be specified in the notice of permission.
    (c) Liability of owner or consignee for expenses connected with
      refusal of admission
      All expenses (including travel, per diem or subsistence, and
    salaries of officers or employees of the United States) in
    connection with the destruction provided for in subsection (a) of
    this section and the supervision of operations provided for in
    subsection (b) of this section, and all expenses in connection with
    the storage, cartage, or labor with respect to any electronic
    product refused admission pursuant to subsection (a) of this
    section, shall be paid by the owner or consignee, and, in event of
    default, shall constitute a lien against any future importations
    made by such owner or consignee.
    (d) Designation of agent for purposes of service
      It shall be the duty of every manufacturer offering an electronic
    product for importation into the United States to designate in
    writing an agent upon whom service of all administrative and
    judicial processes, notices, orders, decisions, and requirements
    may be made for and on behalf of said manufacturer, and to file
    such designation with the Secretary, which designation may from
    time to time be changed by like writing, similarly filed. Service
    of all administrative and judicial processes, notices, orders,
    decisions, and requirements may be made upon said manufacturer by
    service upon such designated agent at his office or usual place of
    residence with like effect as if made personally upon said
    manufacturer, and in default of such designation of such agent,
    service of process, notice, order, requirement, or decision in any
    proceeding before the Secretary or in any judicial proceeding for
    enforcement of this part or any standards prescribed pursuant to
    this part may be made by posting such process, notice, order,
    requirement, or decision in the Office of the Secretary or in a
    place designated by him by regulation.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 360nn. Inspection, records, and reports

-STATUTE-
    (a) Inspection of premises
      If the Secretary finds for good cause that the methods, tests, or
    programs related to electronic product radiation safety in a
    particular factory, warehouse, or establishment in which electronic
    products are manufactured or held, may not be adequate or reliable,
    officers or employees duly designated by the Secretary, upon
    presenting appropriate credentials and a written notice to the
    owner, operator, or agent in charge, are thereafter authorized (1)
    to enter, at reasonable times, any area in such factory, warehouse,
    or establishment in which the manufacturer's tests (or testing
    programs) required by section 360kk(h) of this title are carried
    out, and (2) to inspect, at reasonable times and within reasonable
    limits and in a reasonable manner, the facilities and procedures
    within such area which are related to electronic product radiation
    safety. Each such inspection shall be commenced and completed with
    reasonable promptness. In addition to other grounds upon which good
    cause may be found for purposes of this subsection, good cause will
    be considered to exist in any case where the manufacturer has
    introduced into commerce any electronic product which does not
    comply with an applicable standard prescribed under this part and
    with respect to which no exemption from the notification
    requirements has been granted by the Secretary under section
    360ll(a)(2) or 360ll(e) of this title.
    (b) Record keeping
      Every manufacturer of electronic products shall establish and
    maintain such records (including testing records), make such
    reports, and provide such information, as the Secretary may
    reasonably require to enable him to determine whether such
    manufacturer has acted or is acting in compliance with this part
    and standards prescribed pursuant to this part and shall, upon
    request of an officer or employee duly designated by the Secretary,
    permit such officer or employee to inspect appropriate books,
    papers, records, and documents relevant to determining whether such
    manufacturer has acted or is acting in compliance with standards
    prescribed pursuant to this part.
    (c) Disclosure of technical data
      Every manufacturer of electronic products shall provide to the
    Secretary such performance data and other technical data related to
    safety as may be required to carry out the purposes of this part.
    The Secretary is authorized to require the manufacturer to give
    such notification of such performance and technical data at the
    time of original purchase to the ultimate purchaser of the
    electronic product, as he determines necessary to carry out the
    purposes of this part after consulting with the affected industry.
    (d) Public nature of reports
      Accident and investigation reports made under this part by any
    officer, employee, or agent of the Secretary shall be available for
    use in any civil, criminal, or other judicial proceeding arising
    out of such accident. Any such officer, employee, or agent may be
    required to testify in such proceedings as to the facts developed
    in such investigations. Any such report shall be made available to
    the public in a manner which need not identify individuals. All
    reports on research projects, demonstration projects, and other
    related activities shall be public information.
    (e) Trade secrets
      The Secretary or his representative shall not disclose any
    information reported to or otherwise obtained by him, pursuant to
    subsection (a) or (b) of this section, which concerns any
    information which contains or relates to a trade secret or other
    matter referred to in section 1905 of title 18, except that such
    information may be disclosed to other officers or employees of the
    Department and of other agencies concerned with carrying out this
    part or when relevant in any proceeding under this part. Nothing in
    this section shall authorize the withholding of information by the
    Secretary, or by any officers or employees under his control, from
    the duly authorized committees of the Congress.
    (f) Information required to identify and locate first purchasers of
      electronic products
      The Secretary may by regulation (1) require dealers and
    distributors of electronic products, to which there are applicable
    standards prescribed under this part and the retail prices of which
    is not less than $50, to furnish manufacturers of such products
    such information as may be necessary to identify and locate, for
    purposes of section 360ll of this title, the first purchasers of
    such products for purposes other than resale, and (2) require
    manufacturers to preserve such information. Any regulation
    establishing a requirement pursuant to clause (1) of the preceding
    sentence shall (A) authorize such dealers and distributors to
    elect, in lieu of immediately furnishing such information to the
    manufacturer, to hold and preserve such information until advised
    by the manufacturer or Secretary that such information is needed by
    the manufacturer for purposes of section 360ll of this title, and
    (B) provide that the dealer or distributor shall, upon making such
    election, give prompt notice of such election (together with
    information identifying the notifier and the product) to the
    manufacturer and shall, when advised by the manufacturer or
    Secretary, of the need therefor for the purposes of section 360ll
    of this title, immediately furnish the manufacturer with the
    required information. If a dealer or distributor discontinues the
    dealing in or distribution of electronic products, he shall turn
    the information over to the manufacturer. Any manufacturer
    receiving information pursuant to this subsection concerning first
    purchasers of products for purposes other than resale shall treat
    it as confidential and may use it only if necessary for the purpose
    of notifying persons pursuant to section 360ll(a) of this title.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Jurisdiction of courts
      The district courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction,
    for cause shown, to restrain violations of section 360oo of this
    title and to restrain dealers and distributors of electronic
    products from selling or otherwise disposing of electronic products
    which do not conform to an applicable standard prescribed pursuant
    to section 360kk of this title except when such products are
    disposed of by returning them to the distributor or manufacturer
    from whom they were obtained. The district courts of the United
    States shall also have jurisdiction in accordance with section 1355
    of title 28 to enforce the provisions of subsection (b) of this
    section.
    (b) Penalties
      (1) Any person who violates section 360oo of this title shall be
    subject to a civil penalty of not more than $1,000. For purposes of
    this subsection, any such violation shall with respect to each
    electronic product involved, or with respect to each act or
    omission made unlawful by section 360oo of this title, constitute a
    separate violation, except that the maximum civil penalty imposed
    on any person under this subsection for any related series of
    violations shall not exceed $300,000.
      (2) Any such civil penalty may on application be remitted or
    mitigated by the Secretary. In determining the amount of such
    penalty, or whether it should be remitted or mitigated and in what
    amount, the appropriateness of such penalty to the size of the
    business of the person charged and the gravity of the violation
    shall be considered. The amount of such penalty, when finally
    determined, may be deducted from any sums owing by the United
    States to the person charged.
    (c) Venue; process
      Actions under subsections (a) and (b) of this section may be
    brought in the district court of the United States for the district
    wherein any act or omission or transaction constituting the
    violation occurred, or in such court for the district where the
    defendant is found or transacts business, and process in such cases
    may be served in any other district of which the defendant is an
    inhabitant or wherever the defendant may be found.
    (d) Warnings
      Nothing in this part shall be construed as requiring the
    Secretary to report for the institution of proceedings minor
    violations of this part whenever he believes that the public
    interest will be adequately served by a suitable written notice or
    warning.
    (e) Compliance with regulations
      Except as provided in the first sentence of section 360ss of this
    title, compliance with this part or any regulations issued
    thereunder shall not relieve any person from liability at common
    law or under statutory law.
    (f) Additional remedies
      The remedies provided for in this part shall be in addition to
    and not in substitution for any other remedies provided by law.

        accordance with paragraph (2); or
          (ii) the application is deemed under paragraph (3)(A) to have
        been approved (unless such approval is terminated pursuant to

      in subparagraph (A) or (B), as follows:
          (A) The Secretary makes a determination that, for reasons
        defined by the Secretary, it would be economically prohibitive
        with respect to such drug or device for the manufacturer to
        incur the costs necessary for the submission of a supplemental
        application. In making such determination, the Secretary shall
        consider (in addition to any other considerations the Secretary
        finds appropriate) - 
            (i) the lack of the availability under law of any period
          during which the manufacturer would have exclusive marketing
          rights with respect to the new use involved; and
            (ii) the size of the population expected to benefit from
          approval of the supplemental application.

          (B) The Secretary makes a determination that, for reasons
        defined by the Secretary, it would be unethical to conduct the
        studies necessary for the supplemental application. In making
        such determination, the Secretary shall consider (in addition
        to any other considerations the Secretary finds appropriate)
        whether the new use involved is the standard of medical care
        for a health condition.
      (3) Time for consideration of application; deemed approval
        (A) In general
          The Secretary shall approve or deny an application under
        paragraph (1) for an exemption not later than 60 days after the
        receipt of the application. If the Secretary does not comply
        with the preceding sentence, the application is deemed to be
        approved.
        (B) Termination of deemed approval
          If pursuant to a deemed approval under subparagraph (A) a
        manufacturer disseminates written information under section
        360aaa of this title on a new use, the Secretary may at any
        time terminate such approval and under section 360aaa-4(b)(3)
        of this title order the manufacturer to cease disseminating the
        information.
    (e) Requirements regarding applications
      Applications under this section shall be submitted in the form
    and manner prescribed by the Secretary.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Postdissemination data regarding safety and effectiveness
      (1) Corrective actions
        With respect to data received by the Secretary after the
      dissemination of information under section 360aaa of this title
      by a manufacturer has begun (whether received pursuant to
      paragraph (2) or otherwise), if the Secretary determines that the
      data indicate that the new use involved may not be effective or
      may present a significant risk to public health, the Secretary
      shall, after consultation with the manufacturer, take such action
      regarding the dissemination of the information as the Secretary
      determines to be appropriate for the protection of the public
      health, which may include ordering that the manufacturer cease
      the dissemination of the information.
      (2) Responsibilities of manufacturers to submit data
        After a manufacturer disseminates information under section
      360aaa of this title, the manufacturer shall submit to the
      Secretary a notification of any additional knowledge of the
      manufacturer on clinical research or other data that relate to
      the safety or effectiveness of the new use involved. If the
      manufacturer is in possession of the data, the notification shall
      include the data. The Secretary shall by regulation establish the
      scope of the responsibilities of manufacturers under this
      paragraph, including such limits on the responsibilities as the
      Secretary determines to be appropriate.
    (b) Cessation of dissemination
      (1) Failure of manufacturer to comply with requirements
        The Secretary may order a manufacturer to cease the
      dissemination of information pursuant to section 360aaa of this
      title if the Secretary determines that the information being
      disseminated does not comply with the requirements established in
      this part. Such an order may be issued only after the Secretary
      has provided notice to the manufacturer of the intent of the
      Secretary to issue the order and (unless paragraph (2)(B)
      applies) has provided an opportunity for a meeting with respect
      to such intent. If the failure of the manufacturer constitutes a
      minor violation of this part, the Secretary shall delay issuing
      the order and provide to the manufacturer an opportunity to
      correct the violation.
      (2) Supplemental applications
        The Secretary may order a manufacturer to cease the
      dissemination of information pursuant to section 360aaa of this
      title if - 
          (A) in the case of a manufacturer that has submitted a
        supplemental application for a new use pursuant to section
        360aaa-3(a)(1) of this title, the Secretary determines that the
        supplemental application does not contain adequate information
        for approval of the new use for which the application was
        submitted;
          (B) in the case of a manufacturer that has submitted a
        certification under section 360aaa-3(b) of this title, the
        manufacturer has not, within the 6-month period involved,
        submitted the supplemental application referred to in the
        certification; or
          (C) in the case of a manufacturer that has submitted a
        certification under section 360aaa-3(c) of this title but has
        not yet submitted the supplemental application referred to in
        the certification, the Secretary determines, after an informal
        hearing, that the manufacturer is not acting with due diligence
        to complete the studies involved.
      (3) Termination of deemed approval of exemption regarding
        supplemental applications
        If under section 360aaa-3(d)(3) of this title the Secretary
      terminates a deemed approval of an exemption, the Secretary may
      order the manufacturer involved to cease disseminating the
      information. A manufacturer shall comply with an order under the
      preceding sentence not later than 60 days after the receipt of
      the order.
    (c) Corrective actions by manufacturers
      (1) In general
        In any case in which under this section the Secretary orders a
      manufacturer to cease disseminating information, the Secretary
      may order the manufacturer to take action to correct the
      information that has been disseminated, except as provided in
      paragraph (2).
      (2) Termination of deemed approval of exemption regarding

-STATUTE-
    (a) Emergency situations
      The Secretary may, under appropriate conditions determined by the
    Secretary, authorize the shipment of investigational drugs or
    investigational devices for the diagnosis, monitoring, or treatment
    of a serious disease or condition in emergency situations.
    (b) Individual patient access to investigational products intended
      for serious diseases
      Any person, acting through a physician licensed in accordance
    with State law, may request from a manufacturer or distributor, and
    any manufacturer or distributor may, after complying with the
    provisions of this subsection, provide to such physician an
    investigational drug or investigational device for the diagnosis,
    monitoring, or treatment of a serious disease or condition if - 
        (1) the licensed physician determines that the person has no
      comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy available to
      diagnose, monitor, or treat the disease or condition involved,
      and that the probable risk to the person from the investigational
      drug or investigational device is not greater than the probable
      risk from the disease or condition;
        (2) the Secretary determines that there is sufficient evidence
      of safety and effectiveness to support the use of the
      investigational drug or investigational device in the case
      described in paragraph (1);
        (3) the Secretary determines that provision of the
      investigational drug or investigational device will not interfere
      with the initiation, conduct, or completion of clinical
      investigations to support marketing approval; and
        (4) the sponsor, or clinical investigator, of the
      investigational drug or investigational device submits to the
      Secretary a clinical protocol consistent with the provisions of
      section 355(i) or 360j(g) of this title, including any
      regulations promulgated under section 355(i) or 360j(g) of this
      title, describing the use of the investigational drug or
      investigational device in a single patient or a small group of
      patients.
    (c) Treatment investigational new drug applications and treatment
      investigational device exemptions
      Upon submission by a sponsor or a physician of a protocol
    intended to provide widespread access to an investigational drug or
    investigational device for eligible patients (referred to in this
    subsection as an "expanded access protocol"), the Secretary shall
    permit such investigational drug or investigational device to be
    made available for expanded access under a treatment
    investigational new drug application or treatment investigational
    device exemption if the Secretary determines that - 
        (1) under the treatment investigational new drug application or
      treatment investigational device exemption, the investigational
      drug or investigational device is intended for use in the
      diagnosis, monitoring, or treatment of a serious or immediately
      life-threatening disease or condition;
        (2) there is no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy
      available to diagnose, monitor, or treat that stage of disease or
      condition in the population of patients to which the
      investigational drug or investigational device is intended to be
      administered;
        (3)(A) the investigational drug or investigational device is
      under investigation in a controlled clinical trial for the use
      described in paragraph (1) under an investigational drug
      application in effect under section 355(i) of this title or
      investigational device exemption in effect under section 360j(g)
      of this title; or
        (B) all clinical trials necessary for approval of that use of
      the investigational drug or investigational device have been
      completed;
        (4) the sponsor of the controlled clinical trials is actively
      pursuing marketing approval of the investigational drug or
      investigational device for the use described in paragraph (1)
      with due diligence;
        (5) in the case of an investigational drug or investigational
      device described in paragraph (3)(A), the provision of the
      investigational drug or investigational device will not interfere
      with the enrollment of patients in ongoing clinical
      investigations under section 355(i) or 360j(g) of this title;
        (6) in the case of serious diseases, there is sufficient
      evidence of safety and effectiveness to support the use described
      in paragraph (1); and
        (7) in the case of immediately life-threatening diseases, the
      available scientific evidence, taken as a whole, provides a
      reasonable basis to conclude that the investigational drug or
      investigational device may be effective for its intended use and
      would not expose patients to an unreasonable and significant risk
      of illness or injury.

    A protocol submitted under this subsection shall be subject to the
    provisions of section 355(i) or 360j(g) of this title, including
    regulations promulgated under section 355(i) or 360j(g) of this
    title. The Secretary may inform national, State, and local medical
    associations and societies, voluntary health associations, and
    other appropriate persons about the availability of an
    investigational drug or investigational device under expanded
    access protocols submitted under this subsection. The information
    provided by the Secretary, in accordance with the preceding
    sentence, shall be the same type of information that is required by
    section 282(i)(3) of title 42.
    (d) Termination
      The Secretary may, at any time, with respect to a sponsor,
    physician, manufacturer, or distributor described in this section,
    terminate expanded access provided under this section for an
    investigational drug or investigational device if the requirements
    under this section are no longer met.
    (e) Definitions
      In this section, the terms "investigational drug",
    "investigational device", "treatment investigational new drug
    application", and "treatment investigational device exemption"
    shall have the meanings given the terms in regulations prescribed
    by the Secretary.

          (A) a determination by the Secretary of Homeland Security
        that there is a domestic emergency, or a significant potential
        for a domestic emergency, involving a heightened risk of attack
        with a specified biological, chemical, radiological, or nuclear
        agent or agents;
          (B) a determination by the Secretary of Defense that there is

        military forces of attack with a specified biological,
        chemical, radiological, or nuclear agent or agents; or
          (C) a determination by the Secretary of a public health

          A declaration under this subsection shall terminate upon the
        earlier of - 
            (i) a determination by the Secretary, in consultation as
          appropriate with the Secretary of Homeland Security or the

        declaration under this subsection, and this paragraph shall
        apply to any such renewal.
        (C) Disposition of product
          If an authorization under this section with respect to an
        unapproved product ceases to be effective as a result of a
        termination under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the
        Secretary shall consult with the manufacturer of such product
        with respect to the appropriate disposition of the product.
      (3) Advance notice of termination
        The Secretary shall provide advance notice that a declaration
      under this subsection will be terminated. The period of advance
      notice shall be a period reasonably determined to provide - 
          (A) in the case of an unapproved product, a sufficient period
        for disposition of the product, including the return of such
        product (except such quantities of product as are necessary to
        provide for continued use consistent with subsection (f)(2) of

        manufacturer that chooses to have such product returned); and
          (B) in the case of an unapproved use of an approved product,
        a sufficient period for the disposition of any labeling, or any
        information under subsection (e)(2)(B)(ii) of this section, as

        emergency use involved.

      and renewal under this subsection.
    (c) Criteria for issuance of authorization
      The Secretary may issue an authorization under this section with
    respect to the emergency use of a product only if, after
    consultation with the Director of the National Institutes of Health
    and the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
    (to the extent feasible and appropriate given the circumstances of
    the emergency involved), the Secretary concludes - 
        (1) that an agent specified in a declaration under subsection
      (b) of this section can cause a serious or life-threatening
      disease or condition;
        (2) that, based on the totality of scientific evidence
      available to the Secretary, including data from adequate and well-
      controlled clinical trials, if available, it is reasonable to
      believe that - 
          (A) the product may be effective in diagnosing, treating, or
        preventing - 
            (i) such disease or condition; or
            (ii) a serious or life-threatening disease or condition
          caused by a product authorized under this section, approved
          or cleared under this chapter, or licensed under section 262
          of title 42, for diagnosing, treating, or preventing such a
          disease or condition caused by such an agent; and

          (B) the known and potential benefits of the product, when
        used to diagnose, prevent, or treat such disease or condition,
        outweigh the known and potential risks of the product;

        (3) that there is no adequate, approved, and available
      alternative to the product for diagnosing, preventing, or
      treating such disease or condition; and
        (4) that such other criteria as the Secretary may by regulation
      prescribe are satisfied.
    (d) Scope of authorization
      An authorization of a product under this section shall state - 
        (1) each disease or condition that the product may be used to
      diagnose, prevent, or treat within the scope of the
      authorization;
        (2) the Secretary's conclusions, made under subsection
      (c)(2)(B) of this section, that the known and potential benefits
      of the product, when used to diagnose, prevent, or treat such
      disease or condition, outweigh the known and potential risks of
      the product; and
        (3) the Secretary's conclusions, made under subsection (c) of
      this section, concerning the safety and potential effectiveness
      of the product in diagnosing, preventing, or treating such
      diseases or conditions, including an assessment of the available
      scientific evidence.
    (e) Conditions of authorization
      (1) Unapproved product
        (A) Required conditions
          With respect to the emergency use of an unapproved product,
        the Secretary, to the extent practicable given the
        circumstances of the emergency, shall, for a person who carries
        out any activity for which the authorization is issued,
        establish such conditions on an authorization under this
        section as the Secretary finds necessary or appropriate to
        protect the public health, including the following:

            of the product;
              (II) of the significant known and potential benefits and
            risks of the emergency use of the product, and of the
            extent to which such benefits and risks are unknown; and
              (III) of the alternatives to the product that are
            available, and of their benefits and risks.

            (ii) Appropriate conditions designed to ensure that
          individuals to whom the product is administered are informed -
           
              (I) that the Secretary has authorized the emergency use
            of the product;
              (II) of the significant known and potential benefits and
            risks of such use, and of the extent to which such benefits
            and risks are unknown; and
              (III) of the option to accept or refuse administration of
            the product, of the consequences, if any, of refusing
            administration of the product, and of the alternatives to
            the product that are available and of their benefits and
            risks.

            (iii) Appropriate conditions for the monitoring and
          reporting of adverse events associated with the emergency use
          of the product.
            (iv) For manufacturers of the product, appropriate
          conditions concerning recordkeeping and reporting, including
          records access by the Secretary, with respect to the
          emergency use of the product.
        (B) Authority for additional conditions
          With respect to the emergency use of an unapproved product,
        the Secretary may, for a person who carries out any activity
        for which the authorization is issued, establish such
        conditions on an authorization under this section as the
        Secretary finds necessary or appropriate to protect the public
        health, including the following:
            (i) Appropriate conditions on which entities may distribute
          the product with respect to the emergency use of the product
          (including limitation to distribution by government
          entities), and on how distribution is to be performed.
            (ii) Appropriate conditions on who may administer the
          product with respect to the emergency use of the product, and
          on the categories of individuals to whom, and the
          circumstances under which, the product may be administered
          with respect to such use.
            (iii) Appropriate conditions with respect to the collection
          and analysis of information, during the period when the
          authorization is in effect, concerning the safety and
          effectiveness of the product with respect to the emergency
          use of such product.
            (iv) For persons other than manufacturers of the product,
          appropriate conditions concerning recordkeeping and
          reporting, including records access by the Secretary, with
          respect to the emergency use of the product.
      (2) Unapproved use
        With respect to the emergency use of a product that is an
      unapproved use of an approved product:
          (A) For a manufacturer of the product who carries out any
        activity for which the authorization is issued, the Secretary
        shall, to the extent practicable given the circumstances of the
        emergency, establish conditions described in clauses (i) and
        (ii) of paragraph (1)(A), and may establish conditions
        described in clauses (iii) and (iv) of such paragraph.
          (B)(i) If the authorization under this section regarding the
        emergency use authorizes a change in the labeling of the
        product, but the manufacturer of the product chooses not to
        make such change, such authorization may not authorize
        distributors of the product or any other person to alter or
        obscure the labeling provided by the manufacturer.
          (ii) In the circumstances described in clause (i), for a
        person who does not manufacture the product and who chooses to
        act under this clause, an authorization under this section
        regarding the emergency use shall, to the extent practicable
        given the circumstances of the emergency, authorize such person
        to provide appropriate information with respect to such product
        in addition to the labeling provided by the manufacturer,
        subject to compliance with clause (i). While the authorization
        under this section is effective, such additional information
        shall not be considered labeling for purposes of section 352 of
        this title.
          (C) The Secretary may establish with respect to the
        distribution and administration of the product for the
        unapproved use conditions no more restrictive than those
        established by the Secretary with respect to the distribution
        and administration of the product for the approved use.
      (3) Good manufacturing practice
        With respect to the emergency use of a product for which an
      authorization under this section is issued (whether an unapproved
      product or an unapproved use of an approved product), the
      Secretary may waive or limit, to the extent appropriate given the
      circumstances of the emergency, requirements regarding current
      good manufacturing practice otherwise applicable to the
      manufacture, processing, packing, or holding of products subject
      to regulation under this chapter, including such requirements
      established under section 351 of this title.
      (4) Advertising
        The Secretary may establish conditions on advertisements and
      other promotional descriptive printed matter that relate to the
      emergency use of a product for which an authorization under this
      section is issued (whether an unapproved product or an unapproved
      use of an approved product), including, as appropriate - 
          (A) with respect to drugs and biological products,
        requirements applicable to prescription drugs pursuant to
        section 352(n) of this title; or
          (B) with respect to devices, requirements applicable to
        restricted devices pursuant to section 352(r) of this title.
    (f) Duration of authorization
      (1) In general
        Except as provided in paragraph (2), an authorization under
      this section shall be effective until the earlier of the
      termination of the declaration under subsection (b) of this
      section or a revocation under subsection (g) of this section.
      (2) Continued use after end of effective period
        Notwithstanding the termination of the declaration under
      subsection (b) of this section or a revocation under subsection
      (g) of this section, an authorization shall continue to be
      effective to provide for continued use of an unapproved product
      with respect to a patient to whom it was administered during the
      period described by paragraph (1), to the extent found necessary
      by such patient's attending physician.
    (g) Revocation of authorization
      (1) Review
        The Secretary shall periodically review the circumstances and
      the appropriateness of an authorization under this section.
      (2) Revocation
        The Secretary may revoke an authorization under this section if
      the criteria under subsection (c) of this section for issuance of
      such authorization are no longer met or other circumstances make
      such revocation appropriate to protect the public health or
      safety.
    (h) Publication; confidential information
      (1) Publication
        The Secretary shall promptly publish in the Federal Register a
      notice of each authorization, and each termination or revocation
      of an authorization under this section, and an explanation of the
      reasons therefor (which may include a summary of data or
      information that has been submitted to the Secretary in an
      application under section 355(i) of this title or section 360j(g)
      of this title, even if such summary may indirectly reveal the
      existence of such application).
      (2) Confidential information
        Nothing in this section alters or amends section 1905 of title
      18 or section 552(b)(4) of title 5.
    (i) Actions committed to agency discretion
      Actions under the authority of this section by the Secretary, by
    the Secretary of Defense, or by the Secretary of Homeland Security
    are committed to agency discretion.
    (j) Rules of construction
      The following applies with respect to this section:
        (1) Nothing in this section impairs the authority of the
      President as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the United
      States under article II, section 2 of the United States
      Constitution.
        (2) Nothing in this section impairs the authority of the
      Secretary of Defense with respect to the Department of Defense,
      including the armed forces, under other provisions of Federal
      law.
        (3) Nothing in this section (including any exercise of
      authority by a manufacturer under subsection (e)(2)) impairs the
      authority of the United States to use or manage quantities of a
      product that are owned or controlled by the United States
      (including quantities in the stockpile maintained under section
      247d-6b of title 42).
    (k) Relation to other provisions
      If a product is the subject of an authorization under this
    section, the use of such product within the scope of the
    authorization shall not be considered to constitute a clinical
    investigation for purposes of section 355(i) of this title, section
    360j(g) of this title, or any other provision of this chapter or
    section 262 of title 42.
    (l) Option to carry out authorized activities
      Nothing in this section provides the Secretary any authority to
    require any person to carry out any activity that becomes lawful
    pursuant to an authorization under this section, and no person is
    required to inform the Secretary that the person will not be
    carrying out such activity, except that a manufacturer of a sole-
    source unapproved product authorized for emergency use shall
    report to the Secretary within a reasonable period of time after
    the issuance by the Secretary of such authorization if such
    manufacturer does not intend to carry out any activity under the
    authorization. This section only has legal effect on a person who
    carries out an activity for which an authorization under this
    section is issued. This section does not modify or affect
    activities carried out pursuant to other provisions of this chapter
    or section 262 of title 42. Nothing in this subsection may be
    construed as restricting the Secretary from imposing conditions on
    persons who carry out any activity pursuant to an authorization
    under this section.

      conditional approval under paragraph (1) for the same drug in the
      same dosage form for the same intended use whether or not
      subsequently conditionally approved by the Secretary under
      subsection (b) of this section, or

    either - 
        (1) issue an order, effective for one year, conditionally
      approving the application if the Secretary finds that none of the
      grounds for denying conditional approval, specified in subsection
      (c) of this section applies and publish a Federal Register notice
      of the conditional approval, or
        (2) give the applicant notice of an opportunity for an informal
      hearing on the question whether such application can be
      conditionally approved.
    (c) Order of approval or refusal after hearing
      If the Secretary finds, after giving the applicant notice and an
    opportunity for an informal hearing, that - 
        (1) any of the provisions of section 360b(d)(1)(A) through (D)
      or (F) through (I) of this title are applicable;
        (2) the information submitted to the Secretary as part of the
      application and any other information before the Secretary with
      respect to such drug, is insufficient to show that there is a
      reasonable expectation that the drug will have the effect it
      purports or is represented to have under the conditions of use
      prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling
      thereof; or
        (3) another person has received approval under section 360b of
      this title for the same drug in the same dosage form for the same
      intended use, and that person is able to assure the availability
      of sufficient quantities of the drug to meet the needs for which
      the drug is intended;

    the Secretary shall issue an order refusing to conditionally
    approve the application. If, after such notice and opportunity for
    an informal hearing, the Secretary finds that paragraphs (1)
    through (3) do not apply, the Secretary shall issue an order
    conditionally approving the application effective for one year and
    publish a Federal Register notice of the conditional approval. Any
    order issued under this subsection refusing to conditionally
    approve an application shall state the findings upon which it is
    based.
    (d) Effective period; renewal; refusal of renewal
      A conditional approval under this section is effective for a 1-
    year period and is thereafter renewable by the Secretary annually
    for up to 4 additional 1-year terms. A conditional approval shall
    be in effect for no more than 5 years from the date of approval
    under subsection (b)(1) or (c) of this section unless extended as
    provided for in subsection (h) of this section. The following shall
    also apply:
        (1) No later than 90 days from the end of the 1-year period for
      which the original or renewed conditional approval is effective,
      the applicant may submit a request to renew a conditional
      approval for an additional 1-year term.
        (2) A conditional approval shall be deemed renewed at the end
      of the 1-year period, or at the end of a 90-day extension that
      the Secretary may, at the Secretary's discretion, grant by letter
      in order to complete review of the renewal request, unless the
      Secretary determines before the expiration of the 1-year period
      or the 90-day extension that - 
          (A) the applicant failed to submit a timely renewal request;
          (B) the request fails to contain sufficient information to
        show that - 
            (i) the applicant is making sufficient progress toward
          meeting approval requirements under section 360b(d)(1)(E) of
          this title, and is likely to be able to fulfill those
          requirements and obtain an approval under section 360b of
          this title before the expiration of the 5-year maximum term
          of the conditional approval;
            (ii) the quantity of the drug that has been distributed is
          consistent with the conditionally approved intended use and
          conditions of use, unless there is adequate explanation that
          ensures that the drug is only used for its intended purpose;
          or
            (iii) the same drug in the same dosage form for the same
          intended use has not received approval under section 360b of
          this title, or if such a drug has been approved, that the
          holder of the approved application is unable to assure the
          availability of sufficient quantities of the drug to meet the
          needs for which the drug is intended; or

          (C) any of the provisions of section 360b(e)(1)(A) through
        (B) or (D) through (F) of this title are applicable.

        (3) If the Secretary determines before the end of the 1-year
      period or the 90-day extension, if granted, that a conditional
      approval should not be renewed, the Secretary shall issue an
      order refusing to renew the conditional approval, and such
      conditional approval shall be deemed withdrawn and no longer in
      effect. The Secretary shall thereafter provide an opportunity for
      an informal hearing to the applicant on the issue whether the
      conditional approval shall be reinstated.
    (e) Withdrawal of conditional approval
      (1) The Secretary shall issue an order withdrawing conditional
    approval of an application filed pursuant to subsection (a) of this
    section if the Secretary finds that another person has received
    approval under section 360b of this title for the same drug in the
    same dosage form for the same intended use and that person is able
    to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the drug to
    meet the needs for which the drug is intended.
      (2) The Secretary shall, after due notice and opportunity for an
    informal hearing to the applicant, issue an order withdrawing
    conditional approval of an application filed pursuant to subsection
    (a) of this section if the Secretary finds that - 
        (A) any of the provisions of section 360b(e)(1)(A) through (B)
      or (D) through (F) of this title are applicable; or
        (B) on the basis of new information before the Secretary with
      respect to such drug, evaluated together with the evidence
      available to the Secretary when the application was conditionally
      approved, that there is not a reasonable expectation that such
      drug will have the effect it purports or is represented to have
      under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested
      in the labeling thereof.

      (3) The Secretary may also, after due notice and opportunity for
    an informal hearing to the applicant, issue an order withdrawing
    conditional approval of an application filed pursuant to subsection
    (a) of this section if the Secretary finds that any of the
    provisions of section 360b(e)(2) of this title are applicable.
    (f) Labeling
      (1) The label and labeling of a new animal drug with a
    conditional approval under this section shall - 
        (A) bear the statement, "conditionally approved by FDA pending
      a full demonstration of effectiveness under application number";
      and
        (B) contain such other information as prescribed by the
      Secretary.

      (2) An intended use that is the subject of a conditional approval
    under this section shall not be included in the same product label
    with any intended use approved under section 360b of this title.
    (g) Amendment of application
      A conditionally approved new animal drug application may not be
    amended or supplemented to add indications for use.
    (h) Order of approval after conditional approval period termination
      180 days prior to the termination date established under
    subsection (d) of this section, an applicant shall have submitted
    all the information necessary to support a complete new animal drug
    application in accordance with section 360b(b)(1) of this title or
    the conditional approval issued under this section is no longer in
    effect. Following review of this information, the Secretary shall
    either - 
        (1) issue an order approving the application under section
      360b(c) of this title if the Secretary finds that none of the
      grounds for denying approval specified in section 360b(d)(1) of
      this title applies, or
        (2) give the applicant an opportunity for a hearing before the
      Secretary under section 360b(d) of this title on the question
      whether such application can be approved.

    Upon issuance of an order approving the application, product
    labeling and administrative records of approval shall be modified
    accordingly. If the Secretary has not issued an order under section
    360b(c) of this title approving such application prior to the
    termination date established under subsection (d) of this section,
    the conditional approval issued under this section is no longer in
    effect unless the Secretary grants an extension of an additional
    180-day period so that the Secretary can complete review of the
    application. The decision to grant an extension is committed to the
    discretion of the Secretary and not subject to judicial review.
    (i) Judicial review
      The decision of the Secretary under subsection (c), (d), or (e)
    of this section refusing or withdrawing conditional approval of an
    application shall constitute final agency action subject to
    judicial review.
    (j) Definition
      In this section and section 360ccc-1 of this title, the term
    "transgenic animal" means an animal whose genome contains a
    nucleotide sequence that has been intentionally modified in vitro,
    and the progeny of such an animal; Provided that the term
    "transgenic animal" does not include an animal of which the
    nucleotide sequence of the genome has been modified solely by
    selective breeding.

        "(1) There is a severe shortage of approved new animal drugs
      for use in minor species.
        "(2) There is a severe shortage of approved new animal drugs
      for treating animal diseases and conditions that occur
      infrequently or in limited geographic areas.
        "(3) Because of the small market shares, low-profit margins
      involved, and capital investment required, it is generally not
      economically feasible for new animal drug applicants to pursue
      approvals for these species, diseases, and conditions.
        "(4) Because the populations for which such new animal drugs
      are intended may be small and conditions of animal management may
      vary widely, it is often difficult to design and conduct studies
      to establish drug safety and effectiveness under traditional new
      animal drug approval processes.
        "(5) It is in the public interest and in the interest of animal
      welfare to provide for special procedures to allow the lawful use
      and marketing of certain new animal drugs for minor species and
      minor uses that take into account these special circumstances and
      that ensure that such drugs do not endanger animal or public
      health.
        "(6) Exclusive marketing rights for clinical testing expenses
      have helped encourage the development of 'orphan' drugs for human
      use, and comparable incentives should encourage the development
      of new animal drugs for minor species and minor uses."

    Sec. 360ccc-1. Index of legally marketed unapproved new animal
      drugs for minor species

-STATUTE-
    (a) Establishment and content
      (1) The Secretary shall establish an index limited to - 
        (A) new animal drugs intended for use in a minor species for
      which there is a reasonable certainty that the animal or edible
      products from the animal will not be consumed by humans or food-
      producing animals; and
        (B) new animal drugs intended for use only in a hatchery, tank,
      pond, or other similar contained man-made structure in an early,
      non-food life stage of a food-producing minor species, where
      safety for humans is demonstrated in accordance with the standard
      of section 360b(d) of this title (including, for an antimicrobial
      new animal drug, with respect to antimicrobial resistance).

      (2) The index shall not include a new animal drug that is
    contained in or a product of a transgenic animal.
    (b) Conferences
      Any person intending to file a request under this section shall
    be entitled to one or more conferences to discuss the requirements
    for indexing a new animal drug.
    (c) Request for determination of eligibility for inclusion in index
      (1) Any person may submit a request to the Secretary for a
    determination whether a new animal drug may be eligible for
    inclusion in the index. Such a request shall include - 
        (A) information regarding the need for the new animal drug, the
      species for which the new animal drug is intended, the proposed
      intended use and conditions of use, and anticipated annual
      distribution;
        (B) information to support the conclusion that the proposed use
      meets the conditions of subparagraph (A) or (B) of subsection
      (a)(1) of this section;
        (C) information regarding the components and composition of the
      new animal drug;
        (D) a description of the methods used in, and the facilities
      and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, and packing
      of such new animal drug;
        (E) an environmental assessment that meets the requirements of
      the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 [42 U.S.C. 4321 et
      seq.], as amended, and as defined in 21 CFR Part 25, as it
      appears on August 2, 2004, and amended thereafter or information
      to support a categorical exclusion from the requirement to
      prepare an environmental assessment;
        (F) information sufficient to support the conclusion that the
      proposed use of the new animal drug is safe under section 360b(d)
      of this title with respect to individuals exposed to the new
      animal drug through its manufacture or use; and
        (G) such other information as the Secretary may deem necessary
      to make this eligibility determination.

      (2) Within 90 days after the submission of a request for a
    determination of eligibility for indexing based on subsection
    (a)(1)(A) of this section, or 180 days for a request submitted
    based on subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section, the Secretary shall
    grant or deny the request, and notify the person who requested such
    determination of the Secretary's decision. The Secretary shall
    grant the request if the Secretary finds that - 
        (A) the same drug in the same dosage form for the same intended
      use is not approved or conditionally approved;
        (B) the proposed use of the drug meets the conditions of
      subparagraph (A) or (B) of subsection (a)(1) of this section, as
      appropriate;
        (C) the person requesting the determination has established
      appropriate specifications for the manufacture and control of the
      new animal drug and has demonstrated an understanding of the
      requirements of current good manufacturing practices;
        (D) the new animal drug will not significantly affect the human
      environment; and
        (E) the new animal drug is safe with respect to individuals
      exposed to the new animal drug through its manufacture or use.

    If the Secretary denies the request, the Secretary shall thereafter
    provide due notice and an opportunity for an informal conference. A
    decision of the Secretary to deny an eligibility request following
    an informal conference shall constitute final agency action subject
    to judicial review.
    (d) Request for addition to index
      (1) With respect to a new animal drug for which the Secretary has
    made a determination of eligibility under subsection (c) of this
    section, the person who made such a request may ask that the
    Secretary add the new animal drug to the index established under
    subsection (a) of this section. The request for addition to the
    index shall include - 
        (A) a copy of the Secretary's determination of eligibility
      issued under subsection (c) of this section;
        (B) a written report that meets the requirements in subsection
      (d)(2) of this section;
        (C) a proposed index entry;
        (D) facsimile labeling;
        (E) anticipated annual distribution of the new animal drug;
        (F) a written commitment to manufacture the new animal drug and
      animal feeds bearing or containing such new animal drug according
      to current good manufacturing practices;
        (G) a written commitment to label, distribute, and promote the
      new animal drug only in accordance with the index entry;
        (H) upon specific request of the Secretary, information
      submitted to the expert panel described in paragraph (3); and
        (I) any additional requirements that the Secretary may
      prescribe by general regulation or specific order.

      (2) The report required in paragraph (1) shall - 
        (A) be authored by a qualified expert panel;
        (B) include an evaluation of all available target animal safety
      and effectiveness information, including anecdotal information;
        (C) state the expert panel's opinion regarding whether the
      benefits of using the new animal drug for the proposed use in a
      minor species outweigh its risks to the target animal, taking
      into account the harm being caused by the absence of an approved
      or conditionally approved new animal drug for the minor species
      in question;
        (D) include information from which labeling can be written; and
        (E) include a recommendation regarding whether the new animal
      drug should be limited to use under the professional supervision
      of a licensed veterinarian.

      (3) A qualified expert panel, as used in this section, is a panel
    that - 
        (A) is composed of experts qualified by scientific training and
      experience to evaluate the target animal safety and effectiveness
      of the new animal drug under consideration;
        (B) operates external to FDA; and
        (C) is not subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act.

    The Secretary shall define the criteria for selection of a
    qualified expert panel and the procedures for the operation of the
    panel by regulation.
      (4) Within 180 days after the receipt of a request for listing a
    new animal drug in the index, the Secretary shall grant or deny the
    request. The Secretary shall grant the request if the request for
    indexing continues to meet the eligibility criteria in subsection
    (a) of this section and the Secretary finds, on the basis of the
    report of the qualified expert panel and other information
    available to the Secretary, that the benefits of using the new
    animal drug for the proposed use in a minor species outweigh its
    risks to the target animal, taking into account the harm caused by
    the absence of an approved or conditionally-approved new animal
    drug for the minor species in question. If the Secretary denies the
    request, the Secretary shall thereafter provide due notice and the
    opportunity for an informal conference. The decision of the
    Secretary following an informal conference shall constitute final
    agency action subject to judicial review.
    (e) Index contents; publication
      (1) The index established under subsection (a) of this section
    shall include the following information for each listed drug - 
        (A) the name and address of the person who holds the index
      listing;
        (B) the name of the drug and the intended use and conditions of
      use for which it is being indexed;
        (C) product labeling; and
        (D) conditions and any limitations that the Secretary deems
      necessary regarding use of the drug.

      (2) The Secretary shall publish the index, and revise it
    periodically.
      (3) The Secretary may establish by regulation a process for
    reporting changes in the conditions of manufacturing or labeling of
    indexed products.
    (f) Removal from index; suspended listing
      (1) If the Secretary finds, after due notice to the person who
    requested the index listing and an opportunity for an informal
    conference, that - 
        (A) the expert panel failed to meet the requirements as set
      forth by the Secretary by regulation;
        (B) on the basis of new information before the Secretary,
      evaluated together with the evidence available to the Secretary
      when the new animal drug was listed in the index, the benefits of
      using the new animal drug for the indexed use do not outweigh its
      risks to the target animal;
        (C) the conditions of subsection (c)(2) of this section are no
      longer satisfied;
        (D) the manufacture of the new animal drug is not in accordance
      with current good manufacturing practices;
        (E) the labeling, distribution, or promotion of the new animal
      drug is not in accordance with the index entry;
        (F) the conditions and limitations of use associated with the
      index listing have not been followed; or
        (G) the request for indexing contains any untrue statement of
      material fact,

    the Secretary shall remove the new animal drug from the index. The
    decision of the Secretary following an informal conference shall
    constitute final agency action subject to judicial review.
      (2) If the Secretary finds that there is a reasonable probability
    that the use of the drug would present a risk to the health of
    humans or other animals, the Secretary may - 
        (A) suspend the listing of such drug immediately;
        (B) give the person listed in the index prompt notice of the
      Secretary's action; and
        (C) afford that person the opportunity for an informal
      conference.

    The decision of the Secretary following an informal conference
    shall constitute final agency action subject to judicial review.
    (g) Regulations concerning exemptions for investigational use
      For purposes of indexing new animal drugs under this section, to
    the extent consistent with the public health, the Secretary shall
    promulgate regulations for exempting from the operation of section
    360b of this title minor species new animal drugs and animal feeds
    bearing or containing new animal drugs intended solely for
    investigational use by experts qualified by scientific training and
    experience to investigate the safety and effectiveness of minor
    species animal drugs. Such regulations may, at the discretion of
    the Secretary, among other conditions relating to the protection of
    the public health, provide for conditioning such exemption upon the
    establishment and maintenance of such records, and the making of
    such reports to the Secretary, by the manufacturer or the sponsor
    of the investigation of such article, of data (including but not
    limited to analytical reports by investigators) obtained as a
    result of such investigational use of such article, as the
    Secretary finds will enable the Secretary to evaluate the safety
    and effectiveness of such article in the event of the filing of a
    request for an index listing pursuant to this section.
    (h) Labeling contents
      The labeling of a new animal drug that is the subject of an index
    listing shall state, prominently and conspicuously - 
        (1) "Not approved by fda. - Legally marketed as an FDA indexed
      product. Extra-label use is prohibited.";
        (2) except in the case of new animal drugs indexed for use in
      an early life stage of a food-producing animal, "This product is
      not to be used in animals intended for use as food for humans or
      other animals."; and
        (3) such other information as may be prescribed by the
      Secretary in the index listing.
    (i) Records and reports
      (1) In the case of any new animal drug for which an index listing
    pursuant to subsection (a) of this section is in effect, the person
    who has an index listing shall establish and maintain such records,
    and make such reports to the Secretary, of data relating to
    experience, and other data or information, received or otherwise
    obtained by such person with respect to such drug, or with respect
    to animal feeds bearing or containing such drug, as the Secretary
    may by general regulation, or by order with respect to such
    listing, prescribe on the basis of a finding that such records and
    reports are necessary in order to enable the Secretary to
    determine, or facilitate a determination, whether there is or may
    be ground for invoking subsection (f) of this section. Such
    regulation or order shall provide, where the Secretary deems it to
    be appropriate, for the examination, upon request, by the persons
    to whom such regulation or order is applicable, of similar
    information received or otherwise obtained by the Secretary.
      (2) Every person required under this subsection to maintain
    records, and every person in charge or custody thereof, shall, upon
    request of an officer or employee designated by the Secretary,
    permit such officer or employee at all reasonable times to have
    access to and copy and verify such records.
    (j) Public disclosure of safety and effectiveness data
      (1) Safety and effectiveness data and information which has been
    submitted in support of a request for a new animal drug to be
    indexed under this section and which has not been previously
    disclosed to the public shall be made available to the public, upon
    request, unless extraordinary circumstances are shown - 
        (A) if no work is being or will be undertaken to have the drug
      indexed in accordance with the request,
        (B) if the Secretary has determined that such drug cannot be
      indexed and all legal appeals have been exhausted,
        (C) if the indexing of such drug is terminated and all legal
      appeals have been exhausted, or
        (D) if the Secretary has determined that such drug is not a new
      animal drug.

      (2) Any request for data and information pursuant to paragraph
    (1) shall include a verified statement by the person making the
    request that any data or information received under such paragraph
    shall not be disclosed by such person to any other person - 
        (A) for the purpose of, or as part of a plan, scheme, or device
      for, obtaining the right to make, use, or market, or making,
      using, or marketing, outside the United States, the drug
      identified in the request for indexing; and
        (B) without obtaining from any person to whom the data and
      information are disclosed an identical verified statement, a copy
      of which is to be provided by such person to the Secretary, which
      meets the requirements of this paragraph.

    Sec. 360ccc-2. Designated new animal drugs for minor use or minor
      species

-STATUTE-
    (a) Designation
      (1) The manufacturer or the sponsor of a new animal drug for a
    minor use or use in a minor species may request that the Secretary
    declare that drug a "designated new animal drug". A request for
    designation of a new animal drug shall be made before the
    submission of an application under section 360b(b) of this title or
    section 360ccc of this title for the new animal drug.
      (2) The Secretary may declare a new animal drug a "designated new
    animal drug" if - 
        (A) it is intended for a minor use or use in a minor species;
      and
        (B) the same drug in the same dosage form for the same intended
      use is not approved under section 360b or 360ccc of this title or
      designated under this section at the time the request is made.

      (3) Regarding the termination of a designation - 
        (A) the sponsor of a new animal drug shall notify the Secretary
      of any decision to discontinue active pursuit of approval under
      section 360b or 360ccc of this title of an application for a
      designated new animal drug. The Secretary shall terminate the
      designation upon such notification;
        (B) the Secretary may also terminate designation if the
      Secretary independently determines that the sponsor is not
      actively pursuing approval under section 360b or 360ccc of this
      title with due diligence;
        (C) the sponsor of an approved designated new animal drug shall
      notify the Secretary of any discontinuance of the manufacture of
      such new animal drug at least one year before discontinuance. The
      Secretary shall terminate the designation upon such notification;
      and
        (D) the designation shall terminate upon the expiration of any
      applicable exclusivity period under subsection (c) of this
      section.

      (4) Notice respecting the designation or termination of
    designation of a new animal drug shall be made available to the
    public.
    (b) Grants and contracts for development of designated new animal
      drugs
      (1) The Secretary may make grants to and enter into contracts
    with public and private entities and individuals to assist in
    defraying the costs of qualified safety and effectiveness testing
    expenses and manufacturing expenses incurred in connection with the
    development of designated new animal drugs.
      (2) For purposes of paragraph (1) of this section - 
        (A) The term "qualified safety and effectiveness testing" means
      testing - 
          (i) which occurs after the date such new animal drug is
        designated under this section and before the date on which an
        application with respect to such drug is submitted under
        section 360b of this title; and
          (ii) which is carried out under an investigational exemption
        under section 360b(j) of this title.

        (B) The term "manufacturing expenses" means expenses incurred
      in developing processes and procedures associated with
      manufacture of the designated new animal drug which occur after
      the new animal drug is designated under this section and before
      the date on which an application with respect to such new animal
      drug is submitted under section 360b or 360ccc of this title.
    (c) Exclusivity for designated new animal drugs
      (1) Except as provided in subsection (c)(2) of this section, if
    the Secretary approves or conditionally approves an application for
    a designated new animal drug, the Secretary may not approve or
    conditionally approve another application submitted for such new
    animal drug with the same intended use as the designated new animal
    drug for another applicant before the expiration of seven years
    from the date of approval or conditional approval of the
    application.
      (2) If an application filed pursuant to section 360b of this
    title or section 360ccc of this title is approved for a designated
    new animal drug, the Secretary may, during the 7-year exclusivity
    period beginning on the date of the application approval or
    conditional approval, approve or conditionally approve another
    application under section 360b of this title or section 360ccc of
    this title for such drug for such minor use or minor species for
    another applicant if - 
        (A) the Secretary finds, after providing the holder of such an
      approved application notice and opportunity for the submission of
      views, that in the granted exclusivity period the holder of the
      approved application cannot assure the availability of sufficient
      quantities of the drug to meet the needs for which the drug was
      designated; or
        (B) such holder provides written consent to the Secretary for
      the approval or conditional approval of other applications before
      the expiration of such exclusivity period.

    conditions of use as are customary or usual, except that this
    provision shall not apply to coal-tar hair dye, the label of which
    bears the following legend conspicuously displayed thereon:
    "Caution - This product contains ingredients which may cause skin
    irritation on certain individuals and a preliminary test according
    to accompanying directions should first be made. This product must
    not be used for dyeing the eyelashes or eyebrows; to do so may
    cause blindness.", and the labeling of which bears adequate
    directions for such preliminary testing. For the purposes of this
    paragraph and paragraph (e) the term "hair dye" shall not include
    eyelash dyes or eyebrow dyes.
      (b) If it consists in whole or in part of any filthy, putrid, or

    conditions whereby it may have become contaminated with filth, or
    whereby it may have been rendered injurious to health.
      (d) If its container is composed, in whole or in part, of any
    poisonous or deleterious substance which may render the contents
    injurious to health.
      (e) If it is not a hair dye and it is, or it bears or contains, a
    color additive which is unsafe within the meaning of section
    379e(a) of this title.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 371. Regulations and hearings

-STATUTE-
    (a) Authority to promulgate regulations
      The authority to promulgate regulations for the efficient
    enforcement of this chapter, except as otherwise provided in this
    section, is vested in the Secretary.
    (b) Regulations for imports and exports
      The Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Health and
    Human Services shall jointly prescribe regulations for the
    efficient enforcement of the provisions of section 381 of this
    title, except as otherwise provided therein. Such regulations shall
    be promulgated in such manner and take effect at such time, after
    due notice, as the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall
    determine.
    (c) Conduct of hearings
      Hearings authorized or required by this chapter shall be
    conducted by the Secretary or such officer or employee as he may
    designate for the purpose.
    (d) Effectiveness of definitions and standards of identity
      The definitions and standards of identity promulgated in
    accordance with the provisions of this chapter shall be effective
    for the purposes of the enforcement of this chapter,
    notwithstanding such definitions and standards as may be contained
    in other laws of the United States and regulations promulgated
    thereunder.
    (e) Procedure for establishment
      (1) Any action for the issuance, amendment, or repeal of any
    regulation under section 343(j), 344(a), 346, 351(b), or 352(d) or
    (h) of this title, and any action for the amendment or repeal of
    any definition and standard of identity under section 341 of this
    title for any dairy product (including products regulated under
    parts 131, 133 and 135 of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations)
    shall be begun by a proposal made (A) by the Secretary on his own
    initiative, or (B) by petition of any interested person, showing
    reasonable grounds therefor, filed with the Secretary. The
    Secretary shall publish such proposal and shall afford all
    interested persons an opportunity to present their views thereon,
    orally or in writing. As soon as practicable thereafter, the
    Secretary shall by order act upon such proposal and shall make such
    order public. Except as provided in paragraph (2), the order shall
    become effective at such time as may be specified therein, but not
    prior to the day following the last day on which objections may be
    filed under such paragraph.
      (2) On or before the thirtieth day after the date on which an
    order entered under paragraph (1) is made public, any person who
    will be adversely affected by such order if placed in effect may
    file objections thereto with the Secretary, specifying with
    particularity the provisions of the order deemed objectionable,
    stating the grounds therefor, and requesting a public hearing upon
    such objections. Until final action upon such objections is taken
    by the Secretary under paragraph (3), the filing of such objections
    shall operate to stay the effectiveness of those provisions of the
    order to which the objections are made. As soon as practicable
    after the time for filing objections has expired the Secretary
    shall publish a notice in the Federal Register specifying those
    parts of the order which have been stayed by the filing of
    objections and, if no objections have been filed, stating that
    fact.
      (3) As soon as practicable after such request for a public
    hearing, the Secretary, after due notice, shall hold such a public
    hearing for the purpose of receiving evidence relevant and material
    to the issues raised by such objections. At the hearing, any
    interested person may be heard in person or by representative. As
    soon as practicable after completion of the hearing, the Secretary
    shall by order act upon such objections and make such order public.
    Such order shall be based only on substantial evidence of record at
    such hearing and shall set forth, as part of the order, detailed
    findings of fact on which the order is based. The Secretary shall
    specify in the order the date on which it shall take effect, except
    that it shall not be made to take effect prior to the ninetieth day
    after its publication unless the Secretary finds that emergency
    conditions exist necessitating an earlier effective date, in which
    event the Secretary shall specify in the order his findings as to
    such conditions.
    (f) Review of order
      (1) In a case of actual controversy as to the validity of any
    order under subsection (e) of this section, any person who will be
    adversely affected by such order if placed in effect may at any
    time prior to the ninetieth day after such order is issued file a
    petition with the United States court of appeals for the circuit
    wherein such person resides or has his principal place of business,
    for a judicial review of such order. A copy of the petition shall
    be forthwith transmitted by the clerk of the court to the Secretary
    or other officer designated by him for that purpose. The Secretary
    thereupon shall file in the court the record of the proceedings on
    which the Secretary based his order, as provided in section 2112 of
    title 28.
      (2) If the petitioner applies to the court for leave to adduce
    additional evidence, and shows to the satisfaction of the court
    that such additional evidence is material and that there were
    reasonable grounds for the failure to adduce such evidence in the
    proceeding before the Secretary, the court may order such
    additional evidence (and evidence in rebuttal thereof) to be taken
    before the Secretary, and to be adduced upon the hearing, in such
    manner and upon such terms and conditions as to the court may seem
    proper. The Secretary may modify his findings as to the facts, or
    make new findings, by reason of the additional evidence so taken,
    and he shall file such modified or new findings, and his
    recommendation, if any, for the modification or setting aside of
    his original order, with the return of such additional evidence.
      (3) Upon the filing of the petition referred to in paragraph (1)
    of this subsection, the court shall have jurisdiction to affirm the
    order, or to set it aside in whole or in part, temporarily or
    permanently. If the order of the Secretary refuses to issue, amend,
    or repeal a regulation and such order is not in accordance with law
    the court shall by its judgment order the Secretary to take action,
    with respect to such regulation, in accordance with law. The
    findings of the Secretary as to the facts, if supported by
    substantial evidence, shall be conclusive.
      (4) The judgment of the court affirming or setting aside, in
    whole or in part, any such order of the Secretary shall be final,
    subject to review by the Supreme Court of the United States upon
    certiorari or certification as provided in section 1254 of title
    28.
      (5) Any action instituted under this subsection shall survive
    notwithstanding any change in the person occupying the office of
    Secretary or any vacancy in such office.
      (6) The remedies provided for in this subsection shall be in
    addition to and not in substitution for any other remedies provided
    by law.
    (g) Copies of records of hearings
      A certified copy of the transcript of the record and proceedings
    under subsection (e) of this section shall be furnished by the
    Secretary to any interested party at his request, and payment of
    the costs thereof, and shall be admissible in any criminal, libel
    for condemnation, exclusion of imports, or other proceeding arising
    under or in respect to this chapter, irrespective of whether
    proceedings with respect to the order have previously been
    instituted or become final under subsection (f) of this section.
    (h) Guidance documents
      (1)(A) The Secretary shall develop guidance documents with public
    participation and ensure that information identifying the existence
    of such documents and the documents themselves are made available
    to the public both in written form and, as feasible, through
    electronic means. Such documents shall not create or confer any
    rights for or on any person, although they present the views of the
    Secretary on matters under the jurisdiction of the Food and Drug
    Administration.
      (B) Although guidance documents shall not be binding on the
    Secretary, the Secretary shall ensure that employees of the Food
    and Drug Administration do not deviate from such guidances without
    appropriate justification and supervisory concurrence. The
    Secretary shall provide training to employees in how to develop and
    use guidance documents and shall monitor the development and
    issuance of such documents.
      (C) For guidance documents that set forth initial interpretations
    of a statute or regulation, changes in interpretation or policy
    that are of more than a minor nature, complex scientific issues, or
    highly controversial issues, the Secretary shall ensure public
    participation prior to implementation of guidance documents, unless
    the Secretary determines that such prior public participation is
    not feasible or appropriate. In such cases, the Secretary shall
    provide for public comment upon implementation and take such
    comment into account.
      (D) For guidance documents that set forth existing practices or
    minor changes in policy, the Secretary shall provide for public
    comment upon implementation.
      (2) In developing guidance documents, the Secretary shall ensure
    uniform nomenclature for such documents and uniform internal
    procedures for approval of such documents. The Secretary shall
    ensure that guidance documents and revisions of such documents are
    properly dated and indicate the nonbinding nature of the documents.
    The Secretary shall periodically review all guidance documents and,
    where appropriate, revise such documents.
      (3) The Secretary, acting through the Commissioner, shall
    maintain electronically and update and publish periodically in the
    Federal Register a list of guidance documents. All such documents
    shall be made available to the public.
      (4) The Secretary shall ensure that an effective appeals
    mechanism is in place to address complaints that the Food and Drug
    Administration is not developing and using guidance documents in
    accordance with this subsection.
      (5) Not later than July 1, 2000, the Secretary after evaluating
    the effectiveness of the Good Guidance Practices document,
    published in the Federal Register at 62 Fed. Reg. 8961, shall
    promulgate a regulation consistent with this subsection specifying
    the policies and procedures of the Food and Drug Administration for
    the development, issuance, and use of guidance documents.

    (a) Right of agents to enter; scope of inspection; notice;
      promptness; exclusions
      (1) For purposes of enforcement of this chapter, officers or
    employees duly designated by the Secretary, upon presenting
    appropriate credentials and a written notice to the owner,
    operator, or agent in charge, are authorized (A) to enter, at
    reasonable times, any factory, warehouse, or establishment in which
    food, drugs, devices, or cosmetics are manufactured, processed,
    packed, or held, for introduction into interstate commerce or after
    such introduction, or to enter any vehicle being used to transport
    or hold such food, drugs, devices, or cosmetics in interstate
    commerce; and (B) to inspect, at reasonable times and within
    reasonable limits and in a reasonable manner, such factory,
    warehouse, establishment, or vehicle and all pertinent equipment,
    finished and unfinished materials, containers, and labeling
    therein. In the case of any person (excluding farms and
    restaurants) who manufactures, processes, packs, transports,
    distributes, holds, or imports foods, the inspection shall extend
    to all records and other information described in section 350c of
    this title when the Secretary has a reasonable belief that an
    article of food is adulterated and presents a threat of serious
    adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals, subject
    to the limitations established in section 350c(d) of this title. In
    the case of any factory, warehouse, establishment, or consulting
    laboratory in which prescription drugs, nonprescription drugs
    intended for human use, or restricted devices are manufactured,
    processed, packed, or held, the inspection shall extend to all
    things therein (including records, files, papers, processes,
    controls, and facilities) bearing on whether prescription drugs,

    chapter, or which may not be manufactured, introduced into
    interstate commerce, or sold, or offered for sale by reason of any
    provision of this chapter, have been or are being manufactured,
    processed, packed, transported, or held in any such place, or
    otherwise bearing on violation of this chapter. No inspection
    authorized by the preceding sentence or by paragraph (3) shall
    extend to financial data, sales data other than shipment data,
    pricing data, personnel data (other than data as to qualification
    of technical and professional personnel performing functions
    subject to this chapter), and research data (other than data
    relating to new drugs, antibiotic drugs, and devices and subject to
    reporting and inspection under regulations lawfully issued pursuant
    to section 355(i) or (k) (!1) section 360i, or 360j(g) of this
    title, and data relating to other drugs or devices which in the
    case of a new drug would be subject to reporting or inspection
    under lawful regulations issued pursuant to section 355(j) of this
    title). A separate notice shall be given for each such inspection,
    but a notice shall not be required for each entry made during the
    period covered by the inspection. Each such inspection shall be
    commenced and completed with reasonable promptness.

      (2) The provisions of the third sentence of paragraph (1) shall
    not apply to - 
        (A) pharmacies which maintain establishments in conformance
      with any applicable local laws regulating the practice of
      pharmacy and medicine and which are regularly engaged in
      dispensing prescription drugs or devices, upon prescriptions of
      practitioners licensed to administer such drugs or devices to
      patients under the care of such practitioners in the course of
      their professional practice, and which do not, either through a
      subsidiary or otherwise, manufacture, prepare, propagate,
      compound, or process drugs or devices for sale other than in the
      regular course of their business of dispensing or selling drugs
      or devices at retail;
        (B) practitioners licensed by law to prescribe or administer
      drugs, or prescribe or use devices, as the case may be, and who
      manufacture, prepare, propagate, compound, or process drugs, or
      manufacture or process devices, solely for use in the course of
      their professional practice;
        (C) persons who manufacture, prepare, propagate, compound, or
      process drugs or manufacture or process devices, solely for use
      in research, teaching, or chemical analysis and not for sale;
        (D) such other classes of persons as the Secretary may by
      regulation exempt from the application of this section upon a
      finding that inspection as applied to such classes of persons in
      accordance with this section is not necessary for the protection
      of the public health.

      (3) An officer or employee making an inspection under paragraph
    (1) for purposes of enforcing the requirements of section 350a of

    his judgment, indicate that any food, drug, device, or cosmetic in
    such establishment (1) consists in whole or in part of any filthy,
    putrid, or decomposed substance, or (2) has been prepared, packed,
    or held under insanitary conditions whereby it may have become
    contaminated with filth, or whereby it may have been rendered
    injurious to health. A copy of such report shall be sent promptly
    to the Secretary.
    (c) Receipt for samples taken
      If the officer or employee making any such inspection of a
    factory, warehouse, or other establishment has obtained any sample
    in the course of the inspection, upon completion of the inspection
    and prior to leaving the premises he shall give to the owner,
    operator, or agent in charge a receipt describing the samples
    obtained.
    (d) Analysis of samples furnished owner
      Whenever in the course of any such inspection of a factory or
    other establishment where food is manufactured, processed, or
    packed, the officer or employee making the inspection obtains a
    sample of any such food, and an analysis is made of such sample for
    the purpose of ascertaining whether such food consists in whole or
    in part of any filthy, putrid, or decomposed substance, or is
    otherwise unfit for food, a copy of the results of such analysis
    shall be furnished promptly to the owner, operator, or agent in
    charge.
    (e) Accessibility of records
      Every person required under section 360i or 360j(g) of this title
    to maintain records and every person who is in charge or custody of
    such records shall, upon request of an officer or employee
    designated by the Secretary, permit such officer or employee at all
    reasonable times to have access to, and to copy and verify, such
    records.
    (f) Recordkeeping
      (1) An accredited person described in paragraph (3) shall
    maintain records documenting the training qualifications of the
    person and the employees of the person, the procedures used by the
    person for handling confidential information, the compensation
    arrangements made by the person, and the procedures used by the
    person to identify and avoid conflicts of interest. Upon the
    request of an officer or employee designated by the Secretary, the
    person shall permit the officer or employee, at all reasonable
    times, to have access to, to copy, and to verify, the records.
      (2) Within 15 days after the receipt of a written request from
    the Secretary to an accredited person described in paragraph (3)
    for copies of records described in paragraph (1), the person shall
    produce the copies of the records at the place designated by the
    Secretary.

    or class III devices, which inspections are required under section
    360(h) of this title or are inspections of such establishments
    required to register under section 360(i) of this title. The owner
    or operator of such an establishment that is eligible under
    paragraph (6) may, from the list published under paragraph (4),
    select an accredited person to conduct such inspections.
      (2) Not later than 180 days after October 26, 2002, the Secretary
    shall publish in the Federal Register criteria to accredit or deny
    accreditation to persons who request to perform the duties
    specified in paragraph (1). Thereafter, the Secretary shall inform
    those requesting accreditation, within 60 days after the receipt of
    such request, whether the request for accreditation is adequate for
    review, and the Secretary shall promptly act on the request for
    accreditation. Any resulting accreditation shall state that such
    person is accredited to conduct inspections at device
    establishments identified in paragraph (1). The accreditation of
    such person shall specify the particular activities under this
    subsection for which such person is accredited. In the first year
    following the publication in the Federal Register of criteria to
    accredit or deny accreditation to persons who request to perform
    the duties specified in paragraph (1), the Secretary shall accredit
    no more than 15 persons who request to perform duties specified in
    paragraph (1).
      (3) An accredited person shall, at a minimum, meet the following
    requirements:
        (A) Such person may not be an employee of the Federal
      Government.
        (B) Such person shall be an independent organization which is
      not owned or controlled by a manufacturer, supplier, or vendor of
      articles regulated under this chapter and which has no
      organizational, material, or financial affiliation (including a
      consultative affiliation) with such a manufacturer, supplier, or
      vendor.
        (C) Such person shall be a legally constituted entity permitted
      to conduct the activities for which it seeks accreditation.
        (D) Such person shall not engage in the design, manufacture,
      promotion, or sale of articles regulated under this chapter.
        (E) The operations of such person shall be in accordance with
      generally accepted professional and ethical business practices,
      and such person shall agree in writing that at a minimum the
      person will - 
          (i) certify that reported information accurately reflects
        data reviewed, inspection observations made, other matters that
        relate to or may influence compliance with this chapter, and
        recommendations made during an inspection or at an inspection's
        closing meeting;
          (ii) limit work to that for which competence and capacity are
        available;
          (iii) treat information received, records, reports, and
        recommendations as confidential commercial or financial
        information or trade secret information, except such
        information may be made available to the Secretary;
          (iv) promptly respond and attempt to resolve complaints
        regarding its activities for which it is accredited; and
          (v) protect against the use, in carrying out paragraph (1),
        of any officer or employee of the accredited person who has a
        financial conflict of interest regarding any product regulated
        under this chapter, and annually make available to the public
        disclosures of the extent to which the accredited person, and
        the officers and employees of the person, have maintained
        compliance with requirements under this clause relating to
        financial conflicts of interest.

      (4) The Secretary shall publish on the Internet site of the Food
    and Drug Administration a list of persons who are accredited under
    paragraph (2). Such list shall be updated to ensure that the
    identity of each accredited person, and the particular activities
    for which the person is accredited, is known to the public. The
    updating of such list shall be no later than one month after the
    accreditation of a person under this subsection or the suspension
    or withdrawal of accreditation, or the modification of the
    particular activities for which the person is accredited.
      (5)(A) To ensure that persons accredited under this subsection
    continue to meet the standards of accreditation, the Secretary
    shall (i) audit the performance of such persons on a periodic basis
    through the review of inspection reports and inspections by persons
    designated by the Secretary to evaluate the compliance status of a
    device establishment and the performance of accredited persons, and
    (ii) take such additional measures as the Secretary determines to
    be appropriate.
      (B) The Secretary may withdraw accreditation of any person
    accredited under paragraph (2), after providing notice and an
    opportunity for an informal hearing, when such person is
    substantially not in compliance with the standards of
    accreditation, poses a threat to public health, fails to act in a
    manner that is consistent with the purposes of this subsection, or
    where the Secretary determines that there is a financial conflict
    of interest in the relationship between the accredited person and
    the owner or operator of a device establishment that the accredited
    person has inspected under this subsection. The Secretary may
    suspend the accreditation of such person during the pendency of the
    process under the preceding sentence.
      (6)(A) Subject to subparagraphs (B) and (C), a device
    establishment is eligible for inspections by persons accredited
    under paragraph (2) if the following conditions are met:
        (i) The Secretary classified the results of the most recent
      inspection described in paragraph (1) as "no action indicated" or
      "voluntary action indicated".
        (ii) With respect to inspections to be conducted by an
      accredited person during a 2-year period - 
          (I) the owner or operator of the establishment submits to the
        Secretary a notice requesting clearance to use an accredited
        person to conduct the inspection, and the Secretary provides
        such clearance; and
          (II) such notice identifies the accredited person whom the
        establishment has selected to conduct the inspection, and the
        Secretary agrees to the selected accredited person.

        (iii) With respect to the devices that are manufactured,
      prepared, propagated, compounded, or processed by the
      establishment, at least one of such devices is marketed in the
      United States, and 1 or both of the following additional
      conditions are met:
          (I) At least one of such devices is marketed, or is intended
        to be marketed, in one or more foreign countries, one of which
        countries certifies, accredits, or otherwise recognizes the
        person (accredited under paragraph (2) and identified under
        clause (ii)(II)) as a person authorized to conduct such
        inspections of device establishments.
          (II) The owner or operator of the establishment submits to
        the Secretary a statement that the law of a country in which
        such a device is marketed, or is intended to be marketed,
        recognizes an inspection of the establishment by the Secretary
        or by a person accredited under paragraph (2), and not later
        than 30 days after receiving such statement, the Secretary
        informs the owner or operator of the establishment that the
        owner or operator may submit a notice requesting clearance
        under clause (ii).

        (iv)(I) In the case of an inspection to be conducted pursuant
      to section 360(h) of this title, persons accredited under
      paragraph (2) did not conduct inspections of the establishment
      during the previous 4 years, except that the establishment may
      petition the Secretary for a waiver of such condition. Such a
      waiver may be granted only if the petition states a commercial
      reason for the waiver; the Secretary determines that the public
      health would be served by granting the waiver; and the Secretary
      has conducted an inspection of the establishment during the four-
      year period preceding the date on which the notice under clause
      (ii) is submitted to the Secretary. Such a waiver is deemed to be
      granted only if the Secretary has not determined that the public
      health would not be served by granting the waiver; and the owner
      or operator of the device establishment has requested in writing,
      not later than 18 months following the most recent inspection of
      such establishment by a person accredited under paragraph (2),
      that the Secretary inspect the establishment and the Secretary
      has not conducted an inspection within 30 months after the most
      recent inspection. With respect to such a waiver that is granted
      or deemed to be granted, no additional such waiver may be granted
      or deemed to be granted until after the Secretary has conducted
      an inspection of the establishment.
        (II) In the case of an inspection to be conducted of a device
      establishment required to register pursuant to section 360(i) of
      this title, the Secretary periodically conducts inspections of
      the establishment.

      (B)(i) The Secretary shall respond to a notice under subparagraph
    (A) from a device establishment not later than 30 days after the
    Secretary receives the notice. Through such response, the Secretary
    shall (I) provide clearance under such subparagraph, and agree to
    the selection of an accredited person, or (II) make a request under
    clause (ii). If the Secretary fails to respond to the notice within
    such 30-day period, the establishment is deemed to have such
    clearance, and to have the agreement of the Secretary for such
    selection.
      (ii) The request referred to in clause (i)(II) is - 
        (I) a request to the device establishment involved to submit to
      the Secretary compliance data in accordance with clause (iii); or
        (II) a request to the establishment, or to the accredited
      person identified in the notice under subparagraph (A), for
      information concerning the relationship between the establishment
      and such accredited person, including information about the
      number of inspections of the establishment, or other
      establishments owned or operated by the owner or operator of the
      establishment, that have been conducted by the accredited person.

    The Secretary may make both such requests.
      (iii) The compliance data to be submitted by a device
    establishment under clause (ii) are data describing whether the
    quality controls of the establishment have been sufficient for
    ensuring consistent compliance with current good manufacturing
    practice within the meaning of section 351(h) of this title and
    with other applicable provisions of this chapter. Such data shall
    include complete reports of inspectional findings regarding good
    manufacturing practice or other quality control audits that, during
    the preceding two-year period, were conducted at the establishment
    by persons other than the owner or operator of the establishment,
    together with all other relevant compliance data the Secretary
    deems necessary. Data under the preceding sentence shall
    demonstrate to the Secretary whether the establishment has
    facilitated consistent compliance by promptly correcting any
    compliance problems identified in such inspections.
      (iv)(I) Not later than 60 days after receiving compliance data
    under clause (iii) from a device establishment, the Secretary shall
    provide or deny clearance under subparagraph (A). The Secretary may
    deny clearance if the Secretary determines that the establishment
    has failed to demonstrate consistent compliance for purposes of
    clause (iii). The Secretary shall provide to the establishment a
    statement of such reasons for such determination. If the Secretary
    fails to provide such statement to the establishment within such 60-
    day period, the establishment is deemed to have such clearance.
      (II) If, during the two-year period following clearance under
    subparagraph (A), the Secretary determines that the device
    establishment is substantially not in compliance with this chapter,
    the Secretary may, after notice and a written response, notify the
    establishment that the eligibility of the establishment for the
    inspections by accredited persons has been suspended.
      (v)(I) A request to an accredited person under clause (ii)(II)
    may not seek any information that is not required to be maintained
    by such person in records under subsection (f)(1) of this section.
    Not later than 60 days after receiving the information sought by
    the request, the Secretary shall agree to, or reject, the selection
    of such person by the device establishment involved. The Secretary
    may reject the selection if the Secretary provides to the
    establishment a statement of the reasons for such rejection.
    Reasons for the rejection may include that the establishment or the
    accredited person, as the case may be, has failed to fully respond
    to the request, or that the Secretary has concerns regarding the
    relationship between the establishment and such accredited person.
    If within such 60-day period the Secretary fails to agree to or
    reject the selection in accordance with this subclause, the
    Secretary is deemed to have agreed to the selection.
      (II) If the Secretary rejects the selection of an accredited
    person by a device establishment, the establishment may make an
    additional selection of an accredited person by submitting to the
    Secretary a notice that identifies the additional selection.
    Clauses (i) and (ii), and subclause (I) of this clause, apply to
    the selection of an accredited person through a notice under the
    preceding sentence in the same manner and to the same extent as
    such provisions apply to a selection of an accredited person
    through a notice under subparagraph (A).
      (vi) In the case of a device establishment that under clause (iv)
    is denied clearance under subparagraph (A), or whose selection of
    an accredited person is rejected under clause (v), the Secretary
    shall designate a person to review the findings of the Secretary
    under such clause if, during the 30-day period beginning on the
    date on which the establishment receives the findings, the
    establishment requests the review. The review shall commence not
    later than 30 days after the establishment requests the review,
    unless the Secretary and the establishment otherwise agree.
      (C)(i) In the case of a device establishment for which the
    Secretary classified the results of the most recent inspection of
    the establishment by a person accredited under paragraph (2) as
    "official action indicated", the establishment, if otherwise
    eligible under subparagraph (A), is eligible for further
    inspections by persons accredited under such paragraph if (I) the
    Secretary issues a written statement to the owner or operator of
    the establishment that the violations leading to such
    classification have been resolved, and (II) the Secretary, either
    upon the Secretary's own initiative or a petition of the owner or
    operator of the establishment, notifies the establishment that it
    has clearance to use an accredited person for the inspections. The
    Secretary shall respond to such petition within 30 days after the
    receipt of the petition.
      (ii) If the Secretary denies a petition under clause (i), the
    device establishment involved may, after the expiration of one year
    after such denial, again petition the Secretary for a determination
    of eligibility for inspection by persons accredited by the
    Secretary under paragraph (2). If the Secretary denies such
    petition, the Secretary shall provide the establishment with such
    reasons for such denial within 60 days after the denial. If, as of
    the expiration of 48 months after the receipt of the first
    petition, the establishment has not been inspected by the
    Secretary, the establishment is eligible for further inspections by
    accredited persons.
      (7)(A) Persons accredited under paragraph (2) to conduct
    inspections shall record in writing their inspection observations
    and shall present the observations to the device establishment's
    designated representative and describe each observation.
    Additionally, such accredited person shall prepare an inspection
    report (including for inspections classified as "no action
    indicated") in a form and manner consistent with such reports
    prepared by employees and officials designated by the Secretary to
    conduct inspections.
      (B) At a minimum, an inspection report under subparagraph (A)
    shall identify the persons responsible for good manufacturing
    practice compliance at the inspected device establishment, the
    dates of the inspection, the scope of the inspection, and shall
    describe in detail each observation identified by the accredited
    person, identify other matters that relate to or may influence
    compliance with this chapter, and describe any recommendations
    during the inspection or at the inspection's closing meeting.
      (C) An inspection report under subparagraph (A) shall be sent to
    the Secretary and to the designated representative of the inspected
    device establishment at the same time, but under no circumstances
    later than three weeks after the last day of the inspection. The
    report to the Secretary shall be accompanied by all written
    inspection observations previously provided to the designated
    representative of the establishment.
      (D) Any statement or representation made by an employee or agent
    of a device establishment to a person accredited under paragraph
    (2) to conduct inspections shall be subject to section 1001 of
    title 18.
      (E) If at any time during an inspection by an accredited person
    the accredited person discovers a condition that could cause or
    contribute to an unreasonable risk to the public health, the
    accredited person shall immediately notify the Secretary of the
    identification of the device establishment subject to inspection
    and such condition.
      (8) Compensation for an accredited person shall be determined by
    agreement between the accredited person and the person who engages
    the services of the accredited person, and shall be paid by the
    person who engages such services.
      (9) Nothing in this subsection affects the authority of the
    Secretary to inspect any device establishment pursuant to this
    chapter.
      (10)(A) For fiscal year 2005 and each subsequent fiscal year, no
    device establishment may be inspected during the fiscal year
    involved by a person accredited under paragraph (2) if - 
        (i) of the amounts appropriated for salaries and expenses of
      the Food and Drug Administration for the preceding fiscal year
      (referred to in this subparagraph as the "first prior fiscal
      year"), the amount obligated by the Secretary for inspections of
      device establishments by the Secretary was less than the adjusted
      base amount applicable to such first prior fiscal year; and
        (ii) of the amounts appropriated for salaries and expenses of
      the Food and Drug Administration for the fiscal year preceding
      the first prior fiscal year (referred to in this subparagraph as
      the "second prior fiscal year"), the amount obligated by the
      Secretary for inspections of device establishments by the
      Secretary was less than the adjusted base amount applicable to
      such second prior fiscal year.

      (B)(i) Subject to clause (ii), the Comptroller General of the
    United States shall determine the amount that was obligated by the
    Secretary for fiscal year 2002 for compliance activities of the
    Food and Drug Administration with respect to devices (referred to
    in this subparagraph as the "compliance budget"), and of such
    amount, the amount that was obligated for inspections by the
    Secretary of device establishments (referred to in this
    subparagraph as the "inspection budget").
      (ii) For purposes of determinations under clause (i), the
    Comptroller General shall not include in the compliance budget or
    the inspection budget any amounts obligated for inspections of
    device establishments conducted as part of the process of reviewing
    applications under section 360e of this title.
      (iii) Not later than March 31, 2003, the Comptroller General
    shall complete the determinations required in this subparagraph and
    submit to the Secretary and the Congress a report describing the
    findings made through such determinations.
      (C) For purposes of this paragraph:
        (i) The term "base amount" means the inspection budget
      determined under subparagraph (B) for fiscal year 2002.
        (ii) The term "adjusted base amount", in the case of
      applicability to fiscal year 2003, means an amount equal to the
      base amount increased by 5 percent.
        (iii) The term "adjusted base amount", with respect to
      applicability to fiscal year 2004 or any subsequent fiscal year,
      means the adjusted based amount applicable to the preceding year
      increased by 5 percent.

      (11) The authority provided by this subsection terminates on
    October 1, 2012.
      (12) No later than four years after October 26, 2002, the
    Comptroller General shall report to the Committee on Energy and
    Commerce of the House of Representatives and the Committee on
    Health, Education, Labor and Pensions of the Senate - 
        (A) the number of inspections conducted by accredited persons
      pursuant to this subsection and the number of inspections
      conducted by Federal employees pursuant to section 360(h) of this
      title and of device establishments required to register under
      section 360(i) of this title;
        (B) the number of persons who sought accreditation under this
      subsection, as well as the number of persons who were accredited
      under this subsection;
        (C) the reasons why persons who sought accreditation, but were
      denied accreditation, were denied;
        (D) the number of audits conducted by the Secretary of
      accredited persons, the quality of inspections conducted by
      accredited persons, whether accredited persons are meeting their
      obligations under this chapter, and whether the number of audits
      conducted is sufficient to permit these assessments;
        (E) whether this subsection is achieving the goal of ensuring
      more information about device establishment compliance is being
      presented to the Secretary, and whether that information is of a
      quality consistent with information obtained by the Secretary
      pursuant to inspections conducted by Federal employees;
        (F) whether this subsection is advancing efforts to allow
      device establishments to rely upon third-party inspections for
      purposes of compliance with the laws of foreign governments; and
        (G) whether the Congress should continue, modify, or terminate
      the program under this subsection.

      (13) The Secretary shall include in the annual report required
    under section 393(g) of this title the names of all accredited
    persons and the particular activities under this subsection for
    which each such person is accredited and the name of each
    accredited person whose accreditation has been withdrawn during the
    year.
      (14) Notwithstanding any provision of this subsection, this
    subsection does not have any legal effect on any agreement
    described in section 383(b) of this title between the Secretary and
    a foreign country.

    writing the Federal Trade Commission of the action the Secretary
    proposes to take respecting such food or advertising.
      (2) The notice required by paragraph (1) shall - 
        (A) contain (i) a description of the action the Secretary
      proposes to take and of the advertising which the Secretary has
      determined causes a food to be misbranded, (ii) a statement of
      the reasons for the Secretary's determination that such
      advertising has caused such food to be misbranded, and
        (B) be accompanied by the records, documents, and other written
      materials which the Secretary determines supports his
      determination that such food is misbranded because of such
      advertising.
    (b) Action by Federal Trade Commission precluding action by
      Secretary; exception
      (1) If the Secretary notifies the Federal Trade Commission under
    subsection (a) of this section of action proposed to be taken under
    subchapter III of this chapter with respect to a food or food
    advertising and the Commission notifies the Secretary in writing,
    within the 30-day period beginning on the date of the receipt of
    such notice, that - 
        (A) it has initiated under the Federal Trade Commission Act [15
      U.S.C. 41 et seq.] an investigation of such advertising to
      determine if it is prohibited by such Act or any order or rule
      under such Act,
        (B) it has commenced (or intends to commence) a civil action
      under section 5, 13, or 19 [15 U.S.C. 45, 53, or 57b] with
      respect to such advertising or the Attorney General has commenced
      (or intends to commence) a civil action under section 5 [15
      U.S.C. 45] with respect to such advertising,
        (C) it has issued and served (or intends to issue and serve) a
      complaint under section 5(b) of such Act [15 U.S.C. 45(b)]
      respecting such advertising, or
        (D) pursuant to section 16(b) of such Act [15 U.S.C. 56(b)] it
      has made a certification to the Attorney General respecting such
      advertising,

    the Secretary may not, except as provided by paragraph (2),
    initiate the action described in the Secretary's notice to the
    Federal Trade Commission.
      (2) If, before the expiration of the 60-day period beginning on
    the date the Secretary receives a notice described in paragraph (1)
    from the Federal Trade Commission in response to a notice of the
    Secretary under subsection (a) of this section - 
        (A) the Commission or the Attorney General does not commence a
      civil action described in subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) of
      this subsection respecting the advertising described in the
      Secretary's notice,
        (B) the Commission does not issue and serve a complaint
      described in subparagraph (C) of such paragraph respecting such
      advertising, or
        (C) the Commission does not (as described in subparagraph (D)
      of such paragraph) make a certification to the Attorney General
      respecting such advertising, or, if the Commission does make such
      a certification to the Attorney General respecting such
      advertising, the Attorney General, before the expiration of such
      period, does not cause appropriate criminal proceedings to be
      brought against such advertising,

    the Secretary may, after the expiration of such period, initiate
    the action described in the notice to the Commission pursuant to
    subsection (a) of this section. The Commission shall promptly
    notify the Secretary of the commencement by the Commission of such
    a civil action, the issuance and service by it of such a complaint,
    or the causing by the Attorney General of criminal proceedings to
    be brought against such advertising.
    (c) Secretary's determination of imminent hazard to health as
      suspending applicability of provisions
      The requirements of subsections (a) and (b) of this section do
    not apply with respect to action under subchapter III of this
    chapter with respect to any food or food advertising if the
    Secretary determines that such action is required to eliminate an
    imminent hazard to health.
    (d) Coordination of action by Secretary with Federal Trade
      Commission
      For the purpose of avoiding unnecessary duplication, the
    Secretary shall coordinate any action taken under subchapter III of
    this chapter because of advertising which the Secretary determines
    causes a food to be misbranded with any action of the Federal Trade
    Commission under the Federal Trade Commission Act [15 U.S.C. 41 et
    seq.] with respect to such advertising.

    effective for the Federal Government and that allow for the use of
    donated land, federally owned property, or lease-purchase

    Sec. 379e. Listing and certification of color additives for foods,
      drugs, devices, and cosmetics

-STATUTE-
    (a) Unsafe color additives
      A color additive shall, with respect to any particular use (for
    which it is being used or intended to be used or is represented as
    suitable) in or on food or drugs or devices or cosmetics, be deemed
    unsafe for the purposes of the application of section 342(c),
    351(a)(4), or 361(e) of this title, as the case may be, unless - 
        (1)(A) there is in effect, and such additive and such use are
      in conformity with, a regulation issued under subsection (b) of
      this section listing such additive for such use, including any
      provision of such regulation prescribing the conditions under
      which such additive may be safely used, and (B) such additive
      either (i) is from a batch certified, in accordance with
      regulations issued pursuant to subsection (c) of this section,
      for such use, or (ii) has, with respect to such use, been
      exempted by the Secretary from the requirement of certification;
      or
        (2) such additive and such use thereof conform to the terms of
      an exemption which is in effect pursuant to subsection (f) of
      this section.

    While there are in effect regulations under subsections (b) and (c)
    of this section relating to a color additive or an exemption
    pursuant to subsection (f) of this section with respect to such
    additive, an article shall not, by reason of bearing or containing
    such additive in all respects in accordance with such regulations
    or such exemption, be considered adulterated within the meaning of
    clause (1) of section 342(a) of this title if such article is a
    food, or within the meaning of section 361(a) of this title if such
    article is a cosmetic other than a hair dye (as defined in the last
    sentence of section 361(a) of this title). A color additive for use
    in or on a device shall be subject to this section only if the
    color additive comes in direct contact with the body of man or
    other animals for a significant period of time. The Secretary may
    by regulation designate the uses of color additives in or on
    devices which are subject to this section.
    (b) Listing of colors; regulations; issuance, amendment or repeal;
      referral to advisory committee; report and recommendations;
      appointment and compensation of advisory committee
      (1) The Secretary shall, by regulation, provide for separately
    listing color additives for use in or on food, color additives for
    use in or on drugs, or devices, and color additives for use in or
    on cosmetics, if and to the extent that such additives are suitable
    and safe for any such use when employed in accordance with such
    regulations.
      (2)(A) Such regulations may list any color additive for use
    generally in or on food, or in or on drugs or devices, or in or on
    cosmetics, if the Secretary finds that such additive is suitable
    and may safely be employed for such general use.
      (B) If the data before the Secretary do not establish that the
    additive satisfies the requirements for listing such additive on
    the applicable list pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph,
    or if the proposal is for listing such additive for a more limited
    use or uses, such regulations may list such additive only for any
    more limited use or uses for which it is suitable and may safely be
    employed.
      (3) Such regulations shall, to the extent deemed necessary by the
    Secretary to assure the safety of the use or uses for which a
    particular color additive is listed, prescribe the conditions under
    which such additive may be safely employed for such use or uses
    (including, but not limited to, specifications, hereafter in this
    section referred to as tolerance limitations, as to the maximum
    quantity or quantities which may be used or permitted to remain in
    or on the article or articles in or on which it is used;
    specifications as to the manner in which such additive may be added
    to or used in or on such article or articles; and directions or
    other labeling or packaging requirements for such additive).
      (4) The Secretary shall not list a color additive under this
    section for a proposed use unless the data before him establish
    that such use, under the conditions of use specified in the
    regulations, will be safe: Provided, however, That a color additive
    shall be deemed to be suitable and safe for the purpose of listing
    under this subsection for use generally in or on food, while there
    is in effect a published finding of the Secretary declaring such
    substance exempt from the term "food additive" because of its being
    generally recognized by qualified experts as safe for its intended
    use, as provided in section 321(s) of this title.
      (5)(A) In determining, for the purposes of this section, whether
    a proposed use of a color additive is safe, the Secretary shall
    consider, among other relevant factors - 
        (i) the probable consumption of, or other relevant exposure
      from, the additive and of any substance formed in or on food,
      drugs or devices, or cosmetics because of the use of the
      additive;
        (ii) the cumulative effect, if any, of such additive in the
      diet of man or animals, taking into account the same or any
      chemically or pharmacologically related substance or substances
      in such diet;
        (iii) safety factors which, in the opinion of experts qualified
      by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety of
      color additives for the use or uses for which the additive is
      proposed to be listed, are generally recognized as appropriate
      for the use of animal experimentation data; and
        (iv) the availability of any needed practicable methods of
      analysis for determining the identity and quantity of (I) the
      pure dye and all intermediates and other impurities contained in
      such color additive, (II) such additive in or on any article of
      food, drug or device, or cosmetic, and (III) any substance formed
      in or on such article because of the use of such additive.

      (B) A color additive (i) shall be deemed unsafe, and shall not be
    listed, for any use which will or may result in ingestion of all or
    part of such additive, if the additive is found by the Secretary to
    induce cancer when ingested by man or animal, or if it is found by
    the Secretary, after tests which are appropriate for the evaluation
    of the safety of additives for use in food, to induce cancer in man
    or animal, and (ii) shall be deemed unsafe, and shall not be
    listed, for any use which will not result in ingestion of any part
    of such additive, if, after tests which are appropriate for the
    evaluation of the safety of additives for such use, or after other
    relevant exposure of man or animal to such additive, it is found by
    the Secretary to induce cancer in man or animal: Provided, That
    clause (i) of this subparagraph (B) shall not apply with respect to
    the use of a color additive as an ingredient of feed for animals
    which are raised for food production, if the Secretary finds that,
    under the conditions of use and feeding specified in proposed
    labeling and reasonably certain to be followed in practice, such
    additive will not adversely affect the animals for which such feed
    is intended, and that no residue of the additive will be found (by
    methods of examination prescribed or approved by the Secretary by
    regulations, which regulations shall not be subject to subsection
    (d) of this section) in any edible portion of such animals after
    slaughter or in any food yielded by or derived from the living
    animal.
      (C)(i) In any proceeding for the issuance, amendment, or repeal
    of a regulation listing a color additive, whether commenced by a
    proposal of the Secretary on his own initiative or by a proposal
    contained in a petition, the petitioner, or any other person who
    will be adversely affected by such proposal or by the Secretary's
    order issued in accordance with paragraph (1) of section 371(e) of
    this title if placed in effect, may request, within the time
    specified in this subparagraph, that the petition or order thereon,
    or the Secretary's proposal, be referred to an advisory committee
    for a report and recommendations with respect to any matter arising
    under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, which is involved in such
    proposal or order and which requires the exercise of scientific
    judgment. Upon such request, or if the Secretary within such time
    deems such a referral necessary, the Secretary shall forthwith
    appoint an advisory committee under subparagraph (D) of this
    paragraph and shall refer to it, together with all the data before
    him, such matter arising under subparagraph (B) for study thereof
    and for a report and recommendations on such matter. A person who
    has filed a petition or who has requested the referral of a matter
    to an advisory committee pursuant to this subparagraph (C), as well
    as representatives of the Department, shall have the right to
    consult with such advisory committee in connection with the matter
    referred to it. The request for referral under this subparagraph,
    or the Secretary's referral on his own initiative, may be made at
    any time before, or within thirty days after, publication of an
    order of the Secretary acting upon the petition or proposal.
      (ii) Within sixty days after the date of such referral, or within
    an additional thirty days if the committee deems such additional
    time necessary, the committee shall, after independent study of the
    data furnished to it by the Secretary and other data before it,
    certify to the Secretary a report and recommendations, together
    with all underlying data and a statement of the reasons or basis
    for the recommendations. A copy of the foregoing shall be promptly
    supplied by the Secretary to any person who has filed a petition,
    or who has requested such referral to the advisory committee.
    Within thirty days after such certification, and after giving due
    consideration to all data then before him, including such report,
    recommendations, underlying data, and statement, and to any prior
    order issued by him in connection with such matter, the Secretary
    shall by order confirm or modify any order theretofore issued or,
    if no such prior order has been issued, shall by order act upon the
    petition or other proposal.
      (iii) Where - 
        (I) by reason of subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, the
      Secretary has initiated a proposal to remove from listing a color
      additive previously listed pursuant to this section; and
        (II) a request has been made for referral of such proposal to
      an advisory committee;

    the Secretary may not act by order on such proposal until the
    advisory committee has made a report and recommendations to him
    under clause (ii) of this subparagraph and he has considered such
    recommendations, unless the Secretary finds that emergency
    conditions exist necessitating the issuance of an order
    notwithstanding this clause.
      (D) The advisory committee referred to in subparagraph (C) of
    this paragraph shall be composed of experts selected by the
    National Academy of Sciences, qualified in the subject matter
    referred to the committee and of adequately diversified
    professional background, except that in the event of the inability
    or refusal of the National Academy of Sciences to act, the
    Secretary shall select the members of the committee. The size of
    the committee shall be determined by the Secretary. Members of any
    advisory committee established under this chapter, while attending
    conferences or meetings of their committees or otherwise serving at
    the request of the Secretary, shall be entitled to receive
    compensation at rates to be fixed by the Secretary but at rates not
    exceeding the daily equivalent of the rate specified at the time of
    such service for grade GS-18 of the General Schedule, including
    traveltime; and while away from their homes or regular places of
    business they may be allowed travel expenses, including per diem in
    lieu of subsistence, as authorized by section 5703 of title 5 for
    persons in the Government service employed intermittently. The
    members shall not be subject to any other provisions of law
    regarding the appointment and compensation of employees of the
    United States. The Secretary shall furnish the committee with
    adequate clerical and other assistance, and shall by rules and
    regulations prescribe the procedure to be followed by the
    committee.
      (6) The Secretary shall not list a color additive under this
    subsection for a proposed use if the data before him show that such
    proposed use would promote deception of the consumer in violation
    of this chapter or would otherwise result in misbranding or
    adulteration within the meaning of this chapter.
      (7) If, in the judgment of the Secretary, a tolerance limitation
    is required in order to assure that a proposed use of a color
    additive will be safe, the Secretary - 
        (A) shall not list the additive for such use if he finds that
      the data before him do not establish that such additive, if used
      within a safe tolerance limitation, would achieve the intended
      physical or other technical effect; and
        (B) shall not fix such tolerance limitation at a level higher
      than he finds to be reasonably required to accomplish the
      intended physical or other technical effect.

      (8) If, having regard to the aggregate quantity of color additive
    likely to be consumed in the diet or to be applied to the human
    body, the Secretary finds that the data before him fail to show
    that it would be safe and otherwise permissible to list a color
    additive (or pharmacologically related color additives) for all the
    uses proposed therefor and at the levels of concentration proposed,
    the Secretary shall, in determining for which use or uses such
    additive (or such related additives) shall be or remain listed, or
    how the aggregate allowable safe tolerance for such additive or
    additives shall be allocated by him among the uses under
    consideration, take into account, among other relevant factors (and
    subject to the paramount criterion of safety), (A) the relative
    marketability of the articles involved as affected by the proposed
    uses of the color additive (or of such related additives) in or on
    such articles, and the relative dependence of the industries
    concerned on such uses; (B) the relative aggregate amounts of such
    color additive which he estimates would be consumed in the diet or
    applied to the human body by reason of the various uses and levels
    of concentration proposed; and (C) the availability, if any, of
    other color additives suitable and safe for one or more of the uses
    proposed.
    (c) Certification of colors
      The Secretary shall further, by regulation, provide (1) for the
    certification, with safe diluents or without diluents, of batches
    of color additives listed pursuant to subsection (b) of this
    section and conforming to the requirements for such additives
    established by regulations under such subsection and this
    subsection, and (2) for exemption from the requirement of
    certification in the case of any such additive, or any listing or
    use thereof, for which he finds such requirement not to be
    necessary in the interest of the protection of the public health:
    Provided, That, with respect to any use in or on food for which a
    listed color additive is deemed to be safe by reason of the proviso
    to paragraph (4) of subsection (b), the requirement of
    certification shall be deemed not to be necessary in the interest
    of public health protection.
    (d) Procedure for issuance, amendment, or repeal of regulations
      The provisions of section 371(e), (f), and (g) of this title
    shall, subject to the provisions of subparagraph (C) of subsection
    (b)(5) of this section, apply to and in all respects govern
    proceedings for the issuance, amendment, or repeal of regulations
    under subsection (b) or (c) of this section (including judicial
    review of the Secretary's action in such proceedings) and the
    admissibility of transcripts of the record of such proceedings in
    other proceedings, except that - 
        (1) if the proceeding is commenced by the filing of a petition,
      notice of the proposal made by the petition shall be published in
      general terms by the Secretary within thirty days after such
      filing, and the Secretary's order (required by paragraph (1) of
      section 371(e) of this title) acting upon such proposal shall, in
      the absence of prior referral (or request for referral) to an
      advisory committee, be issued within ninety days after the date
      of such filing, except that the Secretary may (prior to such
      ninetieth day), by written notice to the petitioner, extend such
      ninety-day period to such time (not more than one hundred and
      eighty days after the date of filing of the petition) as the
      Secretary deems necessary to enable him to study and investigate
      the petition;
        (2) any report, recommendations, underlying data, and reasons
      certified to the Secretary by an advisory committee appointed
      pursuant to subparagraph (D) of subsection (b)(5) of this
      section, shall be made a part of the record of any hearing if
      relevant and material, subject to the provisions of section
      556(d) of title 5. The advisory committee shall designate a
      member to appear and testify at any such hearing with respect to
      the report and recommendations of such committee upon request of
      the Secretary, the petitioner, or the officer conducting the
      hearing, but this shall not preclude any other member of the
      advisory committee from appearing and testifying at such hearing;
        (3) the Secretary's order after public hearing (acting upon
      objections filed to an order made prior to hearing) shall be
      subject to the requirements of section 348(f)(2) of this title;
      and
        (4) the scope of judicial review of such order shall be in
      accordance with the fourth sentence of paragraph (2), and with
      the provisions of paragraph (3), of section 348(g) of this title.
    (e) Fees
      The admitting to listing and certification of color additives, in
    accordance with regulations prescribed under this chapter, shall be
    performed only upon payment of such fees, which shall be specified
    in such regulations, as may be necessary to provide, maintain, and
    equip an adequate service for such purposes.
    (f) Exemptions
      The Secretary shall by regulations (issued without regard to
    subsection (d) of this section) provide for exempting from the
    requirements of this section any color additive or any specific
    type of use thereof, and any article of food, drug, or device, or
    cosmetic bearing or containing such additive, intended solely for
    investigational use by qualified experts when in his opinion such
    exemption is consistent with the public health.

                     EFFECTIVE DATE OF 1962 AMENDMENT                 
      Amendment by Pub. L. 87-781 effective Oct. 10, 1962, see section
    107 of Pub. L. 87-781, set out as a note under section 321 of this
    title.

      EFFECTIVE DATE OF 1960 AMENDMENT, TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS, AND
                           EFFECT ON OTHER LAWS
      Title II of Pub. L. 86-618 provided that:
      "Sec. 201. [Definitions.] As used in this title, the term 'basic
    Act' means the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [this chapter];
    the term 'enactment date' means the date of enactment of this Act
    [July 12, 1960]; and other terms, insofar as also used in the basic
    Act (whether before or after enactment of this Act) shall have the
    same meaning as they have, or had when in effect, under the basic
    Act.
      "Sec. 202. [Effective Date.] This Act [amending this section and
    sections 321, 331, 333, 342, 343, 346, 351, 352, 361, 362, and 371
    of this title and repealing sections 354 and 364 of this title]
    shall, subject to the provisions of section 203, take effect on the
    enactment date [July 12, 1960].
      "Sec. 203. [Provisional Listings of Commercially Established
    Colors.] (a)(1) The purpose of this section is to make possible, on
    an interim basis for a reasonable period, through provisional
    listings, the use of commercially established color additives to
    the extent consistent with the public health, pending the
    completion of the scientific investigations needed as a basis for
    making determinations as to listing of such additives under the
    basic Act as amended by this Act. A provisional listing (including
    a deemed provisional listing) of a color additive under this
    section for any use shall, unless sooner terminated or expiring
    under the provisions of this section, expire (A) on the closing
    date (as defined in paragraph (2) of this subsection) or (B) on the
    effective date of a listing of such additive for such use under
    section 706 [now 721] of the basic Act, [this section], whichever
    date first occurs.
      "(2) For the purposes of this section, the term 'closing date'
    means (A) the last day of the two and one-half year period
    beginning on the enactment date [July 12, 1960] or (B), with
    respect to a particular provisional listing (or deemed provisional
    listing) of a color additive or use thereof, such later closing
    date as the Secretary may from time to time establish pursuant to
    the authority of this paragraph. The Secretary may by regulation,
    upon application of an interested person or on his own initiative,
    from time to time postpone the original closing date with respect
    to a provisional listing (or deemed provisional listing) under this
    section of a specified color additive, or of a specified use or
    uses of such additive, for such period or periods as he finds
    necessary to carry out the purpose of this section, if in the
    Secretary's judgment such action is consistent with the objective
    of carrying to completion in good faith, as soon as reasonably
    practicable, the scientific investigations necessary for making a
    determination as to listing such additive, or such specified use or
    uses thereof, under section 706 [now 721] of the basic Act [this
    section]. The Secretary may terminate a postponement of the closing
    date at any time if he finds that such postponement should not have
    been granted, or that by reason of a change in circumstances the
    basis for such postponement no longer exists, or that there has
    been a failure to comply with a requirement for submission of
    progress reports or with other conditions attached to such
    postponement.
      "(b) Subject to the other provisions of this section - 
        "(1) any color additive which, on the day preceding the
      enactment date [July 12, 1960], was listed and certifiable for
      any use or uses under section 406(b), 504, or 604 [section
      346(b), 354, or 364 of this title], or under the third proviso of
      section 402(c) [section 342(c) of this title], of the basic Act,
      and of which a batch or batches had been certified for such use
      or uses prior to the enactment date [July 12, 1960], and
        "(2) any color additive which was commercially used or sold
      prior to the enactment date [July 12, 1960] for any use or uses
      in or on any food, drug, or cosmetic, and which either, (A), on
      the day preceding the enactment date [July 12, 1960], was not a
      material within the purview of any of the provisions of the basic
      Act enumerated in paragraph (1) of this subsection, or (B) is the
      color additive known as synthetic beta-carotene,
    shall, beginning on the enactment date [July 12, 1960], be deemed
    to be provisionally listed under this section as a color additive
    for such use or uses.
      "(c) Upon request of any person, the Secretary, by regulations
    issued under subsection (d), shall without delay, if on the basis
    of the data before him he deems such action consistent with the
    protection of the public health, provisionally list a material as a
    color additive for any use for which it was listed, and for which a
    batch or batches of such material had been certified, under section
    406(b), 504, or 604 of the basic Act [section 346(b), 354, or 364
    of this title] prior to the enactment date [July 12, 1960],
    although such color was no longer listed and certifiable for such
    use under such sections on the day preceding the enactment date.
    Such provisional listing shall take effect on the date of
    publication.
      "(d)(1) The Secretary shall, by regulations issued or amended
    from time to time under this section - 
        "(A) insofar as practicable promulgate and keep current a list
      or lists of the color additives, and of the particular uses
      thereof, which he finds are deemed provisionally listed under
      subsection (b), and the presence of a color additive on such a
      list with respect to a particular use shall, in any proceeding
      under the basic Act, be conclusive evidence that such provisional
      listing is in effect;
        "(B) provide for the provisional listing of the color additives
      and particular uses thereof specified in subsection (c);
        "(C) provide, with respect to particular uses for which color
      additives are or are deemed to be provisionally listed, such
      temporary tolerance limitations (including such limitations at
      zero level) and other conditions of use and labeling or packaging
      requirements, if any, as in his judgment are necessary to protect
      the public health pending listing under section 706 [now 721] of
      the basic Act [this section];
        "(D) provide for the certification of batches of such color
      additives (with or without diluents) for the uses for which they
      are so listed or deemed to be listed under this section, except
      that such an additive which is a color additive deemed
      provisionally listed under subsection (b)(2) of this section
      shall be deemed exempt from the requirement of such certification
      while not subject to a tolerance limitation; and
        "(E) provide for the termination of a provisional listing (or
      deemed provisional listing) of a color additive or particular use
      thereof forthwith whenever in his judgment such action is
      necessary to protect the public health.
      "(2)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (C) of this paragraph,
    regulations under this section shall, from time to time, be issued,
    amended, or repealed by the Secretary without regard to the
    requirements of the basic Act [subsec. (e) of this section], but
    for the purposes of the application of section 706(e) [now 721(e)]
    of the basic Act (relating to fees) and of determining the
    availability of appropriations of fees (and of advance deposits to
    cover fees), proceedings, regulations, and certifications under
    this section shall be deemed to be proceedings, regulations, and
    certifications under such section 706 [now 721, this section].
    Regulations providing for fees (and advance deposits to cover
    fees), which on the day preceding the enactment date [July 12,
    1960] were in effect pursuant to section 706 [now 721] of the basic
    Act [this section], shall be deemed to be regulations under such
    section 706 [now 721, this section] as amended by this Act, and
    appropriations of fees (and advance deposits) available for the
    purposes specified in such section 706 [now 721] as in effect prior
    to the enactment date [July 12, 1960] shall be available for the
    purposes specified in such section 706 [now 721, this section] as
    so amended.
      "(B) If the Secretary, by regulation - 
        "(i) has terminated a provisional listing (or deemed
      provisional listing) of a color additive or particular use
      thereof pursuant to paragraph (1)(E) of this subsection; or
        "(ii) has, pursuant to paragraph (1)(C) or paragraph (3) of
      this subsection, initially established or rendered more
      restrictive a tolerance limitation or other restriction or
      requirement with respect to a provisional listing (or deemed
      provisional listing) which listing had become effective prior to
      such action,
    any person adversely affected by such action may, prior to the
    expiration of the period specified in clause (A) of subsection
    (a)(2) of this section, file with the Secretary a petition for
    amendment of such regulation so as to revoke or modify such action
    of the Secretary, but the filing of such petition shall not operate
    to stay or suspend the effectiveness of such action. Such petition
    shall, in accordance with regulations, set forth the proposed
    amendment and shall contain data (or refer to data which are before
    the Secretary or of which he will take official notice), which show
    that the revocation or modification proposed is consistent with the
    protection of the public health. The Secretary shall, after
    publishing such proposal and affording all interested persons an
    opportunity to present their views thereon orally or in writing,
    act upon such proposal by published order.
      "(C) Any person adversely affected by an order entered under
    subparagraph (B) of this paragraph may, within thirty days after
    its publication, file objections thereto with the Secretary,
    specifying with particularity the provisions of the order deemed
    objectionable, stating reasonable grounds for such objections, and
    requesting a public hearing upon such objections. The Secretary
    shall hold a public hearing on such objections and shall, on the
    basis of the evidence adduced at such hearing, act on such
    objections by published order. Such order may reinstate a
    terminated provisional listing, or increase or dispense with a
    previously established temporary tolerance limitation, or make less
    restrictive any other limitation established by him under paragraph
    (1) or (3) of this subsection, only if in his judgment the evidence
    so adduced shows that such action will be consistent with the
    protection of the public health. An order entered under this
    subparagraph shall be subject to judicial review in accordance with
    section 701(f) of the basic Act [section 371(f) of this title]
    except that the findings and order of the Secretary shall be
    sustained only if based upon a fair evaluation of the entire record
    at such hearing. No stay or suspension of such order shall be
    ordered by the court pending conclusion of such judicial review.
      "(D) On and after the enactment date [July 12, 1960],
    regulations, provisional listings, and certifications (or
    exemptions from certification) in effect under this section shall,
    for the purpose of determining whether an article is adulterated or
    misbranded within the meaning of the basic Act by reason of its
    being, bearing, or containing a color additive, have the same
    effect as would regulations, listings, and certifications (or
    exemptions from certification) under section 706 [now 721] of the
    basic Act [this section]. A regulation, provisional listing or
    termination thereof, tolerance limitation, or certification or
    exemption therefrom, under this section shall not be the basis for
    any presumption or inference in any proceeding under section 706(b)
    or (c) [now 721(b), (c)] of the basic Act [subsec. (b) or (c) of
    this section].
      "(3) For the purpose of enabling the Secretary to carry out his
    functions under paragraphs (1)(A) and (C) of this subsection with
    respect to color additives deemed provisionally listed, he shall,
    as soon as practicable after enactment of this Act [July 12, 1960],
    afford by public notice a reasonable opportunity to interested
    persons to submit data relevant thereto. If the data so submitted
    or otherwise before him do not, in his judgment, establish a
    reliable basis for including such a color additive or particular
    use or uses thereof in a list or lists promulgated under paragraph
    (1)(A), or for determining the prevailing level or levels of use
    thereof prior to the enactment date [July 12, 1960] with a view to
    prescribing a temporary tolerance or tolerances for such use or
    uses under paragraph (1)(C), the Secretary shall establish a
    temporary tolerance limitation at zero level for such use or uses
    until such time as he finds that it would not be inconsistent with
    the protection of the public health to increase or dispense with
    such temporary tolerance limitation.

      (1) Human drug application and supplement fee
        (A) In general
          Each person that submits, on or after September 1, 1992, a
        human drug application or a supplement shall be subject to a
        fee as follows:
            (i) A fee established under subsection (c)(4) of this
          section for a human drug application for which clinical data
          (other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies) with
          respect to safety or effectiveness are required for approval.
            (ii) A fee established under subsection (c)(4) of this
          section for a human drug application for which clinical data
          with respect to safety or effectiveness are not required or a
          supplement for which clinical data (other than
          bioavailability or bioequivalence studies) with respect to
          safety or effectiveness are required. Such fee shall be half
          of the amount of the fee established under clause (i).
        (B) Payment
          The fee required by subparagraph (A) shall be due upon
        submission of the application or supplement.
        (C) Exception for previously filed application or supplement
          If a human drug application or supplement was submitted by a
        person that paid the fee for such application or supplement,
        was accepted for filing, and was not approved or was withdrawn
        (without a waiver), the submission of a human drug application
        or a supplement for the same product by the same person (or the
        person's licensee, assignee, or successor) shall not be subject
        to a fee under subparagraph (A).
        (D) Refund of fee if application refused for filing
          The Secretary shall refund 75 percent of the fee paid under
        subparagraph (B) for any application or supplement which is
        refused for filing.
        (E) Exception for designated orphan drug or indication
          A human drug application for a prescription drug product that
        has been designated as a drug for a rare disease or condition
        pursuant to section 360bb of this title shall not be subject to
        a fee under subparagraph (A), unless the human drug application

        condition. A supplement proposing to include a new indication
        for a rare disease or condition in a human drug application
        shall not be subject to a fee under subparagraph (A), if the
        drug has been designated pursuant to section 360bb of this
        title as a drug for a rare disease or condition with regard to
        the indication proposed in such supplement.
        (F) Refund of fee if application withdrawn
          If an application or supplement is withdrawn after the
        application or supplement was filed, the Secretary may refund
        the fee or a portion of the fee if no substantial work was
        performed on the application or supplement after the
        application or supplement was filed. The Secretary shall have
        the sole discretion to refund a fee or a portion of the fee

        reviewable.
      (2) Prescription drug establishment fee
        (A) In general
          Except as provided in subparagraph (B), each person that - 
            (i) is named as the applicant in a human drug application;
          and
            (ii) after September 1, 1992, had pending before the
          Secretary a human drug application or supplement,

        shall be assessed an annual fee established under subsection
        (c)(4) of this section for each prescription drug establishment
        listed in its approved human drug application as an
        establishment that manufactures the prescription drug product
        named in the application. The annual establishment fee shall be
        assessed in each fiscal year in which the prescription drug
        product named in the application is assessed a fee under
        paragraph (3) unless the prescription drug establishment listed
        in the application does not engage in the manufacture of the
        prescription drug product during the fiscal year. The
        establishment fee shall be payable on or before October 1 of
        each year. Each such establishment shall be assessed only one
        fee per establishment, notwithstanding the number of
        prescription drug products manufactured at the establishment.
        In the event an establishment is listed in a human drug
        application by more than one applicant, the establishment fee
        for the fiscal year shall be divided equally and assessed among
        the applicants whose prescription drug products are
        manufactured by the establishment during the fiscal year and
        assessed product fees under paragraph (3).
        (B) Exception
          If, during the fiscal year, an applicant initiates or causes
        to be initiated the manufacture of a prescription drug product
        at an establishment listed in its human drug application - 
            (i) that did not manufacture the product in the previous
          fiscal year; and
            (ii) for which the full establishment fee has been assessed
          in the fiscal year at a time before manufacture of the
          prescription drug product was begun;

        the applicant will not be assessed a share of the establishment
        fee for the fiscal year in which the manufacture of the product
        began.
      (3) Prescription drug product fee
        (A) In general
          Except as provided in subparagraph (B), each person who is
        named as the applicant in a human drug application, and who,
        after September 1, 1992, had pending before the Secretary a
        human drug application or supplement, shall pay for each such
        prescription drug product the annual fee established under
        subsection (c)(4) of this section. Such fee shall be payable on

        once for each product for a fiscal year in which the fee is
        payable.
        (B) Exception
          A prescription drug product shall not be assessed a fee under
        subparagraph (A) if such product is identified on the list
        compiled under section 355(j)(7)(A) of this title with a
        potency described in terms of per 100 mL, or if such product is
        the same product as another product approved under an
        application filed under section 355(b) or 355(j) of this title,
        under an abbreviated application filed under section 357 of
        this title (as in effect on the day before November 21, 1997),
        or under an abbreviated new drug application pursuant to
        regulations in effect prior to the implementation of the Drug
        Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984.

    --------------------------------------------------------------------

    If, after June 12, 2002, legislation is enacted requiring the
    Secretary to fund additional costs of the retirement of Federal
    personnel, fee revenue amounts shall be increased in each year by
    the amount necessary to fully fund the portion of such additional
    costs that are attributable to the process for the review of human
    drug applications.
    (c) Adjustments
      (1) Inflation adjustment
        The revenues established in subsection (b) of this section
      shall be adjusted by the Secretary by notice, published in the
      Federal Register, for a fiscal year to reflect the greater of - 
          (A) the total percentage change that occurred in the Consumer
        Price Index for all urban consumers (all items; U.S. city
        average) for the 12 month period ending June 30 preceding the
        fiscal year for which fees are being established, or
          (B) the total percentage change for the previous fiscal year
        in basic pay under the General Schedule in accordance with
        section 5332 of title 5, as adjusted by any locality-based
        comparability payment pursuant to section 5304 of such title
        for Federal employees stationed in the District of Columbia.

      The adjustment made each fiscal year by this subsection will be
      added on a compounded basis to the sum of all adjustments made
      each fiscal year after fiscal year 2003 under this subsection.
      (2) Workload adjustment
        Beginning with fiscal year 2004, after the fee revenues
      established in subsection (b) of this section are adjusted for a
      fiscal year for inflation in accordance with paragraph (1), the
      fee revenues shall be adjusted further for such fiscal year to
      reflect changes in the workload of the Secretary for the process
      for the review of human drug applications. With respect to such
      adjustment:
          (A) The adjustment shall be determined by the Secretary based
        on a weighted average of the change in the total number of
        human drug applications, commercial investigational new drug
        applications, efficacy supplements, and manufacturing
        supplements submitted to the Secretary. The Secretary shall
        publish in the Federal Register the fee revenues and fees
        resulting from the adjustment and the supporting methodologies.
          (B) Under no circumstances shall the adjustment result in fee
        revenues for a fiscal year that are less than the fee revenues
        for the fiscal year established in subsection (b) of this
        section, as adjusted for inflation under paragraph (1).
      (3) Final year adjustment
        For fiscal year 2007, the Secretary may, in addition to
      adjustments under paragraphs (1) and (2), further increase the
      fee revenues and fees established in subsection (b) of this
      section if such an adjustment is necessary to provide for not
      more than three months of operating reserves of carryover user
      fees for the process for the review of human drug applications
      for the first three months of fiscal year 2008. If such an
      adjustment is necessary, the rationale for the amount of the
      increase shall be contained in the annual notice establishing fee
      revenues and fees for fiscal year 2007. If the Secretary has
      carryover balances for such process in excess of three months of
      such operating reserves, the adjustment under this paragraph
      shall not be made.
      (4) Annual fee setting
        The Secretary shall, 60 days before the start of each fiscal
      year that begins after September 30, 2002, establish, for the
      next fiscal year, application, product, and establishment fees
      under subsection (a) of this section, based on the revenue
      amounts established under subsection (b) of this section and the
      adjustments provided under this subsection.
      (5) Limit
        The total amount of fees charged, as adjusted under this
      subsection, for a fiscal year may not exceed the total costs for
      such fiscal year for the resources allocated for the process for
      the review of human drug applications.
    (d) Fee waiver or reduction
      (1) In general
        The Secretary shall grant a waiver from or a reduction of one
      or more fees assessed under subsection (a) of this section where
      the Secretary finds that - 
          (A) such waiver or reduction is necessary to protect the
        public health,
          (B) the assessment of the fee would present a significant
        barrier to innovation because of limited resources available to
        such person or other circumstances,
          (C) the fees to be paid by such person will exceed the
        anticipated present and future costs incurred by the Secretary
        in conducting the process for the review of human drug
        applications for such person, or
          (D) the applicant involved is a small business submitting its
        first human drug application to the Secretary for review.
      (2) Use of standard costs
        In making the finding in paragraph (1)(C), the Secretary may
      use standard costs.
      (3) Rules relating to small businesses
        (A) "Small business" defined
          In paragraph (1)(D), the term "small business" means an
        entity that has fewer than 500 employees, including employees
        of affiliates.
        (B) Waiver of application fee
          The Secretary shall waive under paragraph (1)(D) the
        application fee for the first human drug application that a
        small business or its affiliate submits to the Secretary for
        review. After a small business or its affiliate is granted such
        a waiver, the small business or its affiliate shall pay - 
            (i) application fees for all subsequent human drug
          applications submitted to the Secretary for review in the
          same manner as an entity that does not qualify as a small
          business; and
            (ii) all supplement fees for all supplements to human drug
          applications submitted to the Secretary for review in the
          same manner as an entity that does not qualify as a small
          business.
    (e) Effect of failure to pay fees
      A human drug application or supplement submitted by a person
    subject to fees under subsection (a) of this section shall be
    considered incomplete and shall not be accepted for filing by the
    Secretary until all fees owed by such person have been paid.
    (f) Limitations
      (1) In general
        Fees under subsection (a) of this section shall be refunded for
      a fiscal year beginning after fiscal year 1997 unless
      appropriations for salaries and expenses of the Food and Drug
      Administration for such fiscal year (excluding the amount of fees
      appropriated for such fiscal year) are equal to or greater than
      the amount of appropriations for the salaries and expenses of the
      Food and Drug Administration for the fiscal year 1997 (excluding
      the amount of fees appropriated for such fiscal year) multiplied
      by the adjustment factor applicable to the fiscal year involved.
      (2) Authority
        If the Secretary does not assess fees under subsection (a) of
      this section during any portion of a fiscal year because of
      paragraph (1) and if at a later date in such fiscal year the
      Secretary may assess such fees, the Secretary may assess and
      collect such fees, without any modification in the rate, for
      human drug applications and supplements, prescription drug
      establishments, and prescription drug products at any time in
      such fiscal year notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a)
      of this section relating to the date fees are to be paid.
    (g) Crediting and availability of fees
      (1) In general
        Fees authorized under subsection (a) of this section shall be
      collected and available for obligation only to the extent and in
      the amount provided in advance in appropriations Acts. Such fees
      are authorized to remain available until expended. Such sums as
      may be necessary may be transferred from the Food and Drug
      Administration salaries and expenses appropriation account
      without fiscal year limitation to such appropriation account for
      salaries and expenses with such fiscal year limitation. The sums
      transferred shall be available solely for the process for the
      review of human drug applications.
      (2) Collections and appropriation acts
        (A) In general
          The fees authorized by this section - 
            (i) shall be retained in each fiscal year in an amount not
          to exceed the amount specified in appropriation Acts, or
          otherwise made available for obligation, for such fiscal
          year, and
            (ii) shall only be collected and available to defray
          increases in the costs of the resources allocated for the
          process for the review of human drug applications (including
          increases in such costs for an additional number of full-time
          equivalent positions in the Department of Health and Human
          Services to be engaged in such process) over such costs,
          excluding costs paid from fees collected under this section,
          for fiscal year 1997 multiplied by the adjustment factor.
        (B) Compliance
          The Secretary shall be considered to have met the
        requirements of subparagraph (A)(ii) in any fiscal year if the
        costs funded by appropriations and allocated for the process
        for the review of human drug applications - 
            (i) are not more than 3 percent below the level specified
          in subparagraph (A)(ii); or
            (ii)(I) are more than 3 percent below the level specified
          in subparagraph (A)(ii), and fees assessed for the fiscal
          year following the subsequent fiscal year are decreased by
          the amount in excess of 3 percent by which such costs fell
          below the level specified in such subparagraph; and
            (II) such costs are not more than 5 percent below the level
          specified in such subparagraph.
      (3) Authorization of appropriations
        There are authorized to be appropriated for fees under this
      section - 
          (A) $222,900,000 for fiscal year 2003;
          (B) $231,000,000 for fiscal year 2004;
          (C) $252,000,000 for fiscal year 2005;
          (D) $259,300,000 for fiscal year 2006; and
          (E) $259,300,000 for fiscal year 2007;

      as adjusted to reflect adjustments in the total fee revenues made
      under this section and changes in the total amounts collected by
      application, supplement, establishment, and product fees.
      (4) Offset
        Any amount of fees collected for a fiscal year under this
      section that exceeds the amount of fees specified in
      appropriation Acts for such fiscal year shall be credited to the
      appropriation account of the Food and Drug Administration as
      provided in paragraph (1), and shall be subtracted from the
      amount of fees that would otherwise be authorized to be collected
      under this section pursuant to appropriation Acts for a
      subsequent fiscal year.
    (h) Collection of unpaid fees
      In any case where the Secretary does not receive payment of a fee
    assessed under subsection (a) of this section within 30 days after
    it is due, such fee shall be treated as a claim of the United
    States Government subject to subchapter II of chapter 37 of title
    31.
    (i) Written requests for waivers, reductions, and refunds
      To qualify for consideration for a waiver or reduction under
    subsection (d) of this section, or for a refund of any fee
    collected in accordance with subsection (a) of this section, a
    person shall submit to the Secretary a written request for such
    waiver, reduction, or refund not later than 180 days after such fee
    is due.
    (j) Construction
      This section may not be construed to require that the number of
    full-time equivalent positions in the Department of Health and
    Human Services, for officers, employers, and advisory committees
    not engaged in the process of the review of human drug
    applications, be reduced to offset the number of officers,
    employees, and advisory committees so engaged.

          before a first action, the Secretary may return some or all
          of the fee. The amount of refund, if any, shall be based on
          the level of effort already expended on the review of such
          application, report, or supplement. The Secretary shall have
          sole discretion to refund a fee or portion of the fee under

    necessary to fully fund the portion of such additional costs that
    are attributable to the process for the review of device

    (c) Annual fee setting

        The Secretary shall, 60 days before the start of each fiscal
      year after September 30, 2002, publish in the Federal Register

      fee of $259,600, and the fees established for fiscal year 2007
      shall be based on a premarket application fee of $281,600.
      (2) Limit
        The total amount of fees charged, as adjusted under this
      subsection, for a fiscal year may not exceed the total costs for
      such fiscal year for the resources allocated for the process for
      the review of device applications.
      (3) Supplement
        (A) In general
          For fiscal years 2006 and 2007, the Secretary may use
        unobligated carryover balances from fees collected in previous
        fiscal years to ensure that sufficient fee revenues are
        available in that fiscal year, so long as the Secretary
        maintains unobligated carryover balances of not less than 1
        month of operating reserves for the first month of fiscal year
        2008.
        (B) Notice to Congress
          Not later than 14 days before the Secretary anticipates the
        use of funds described in subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall
        provide notice to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor,
        and Pensions and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate
        and the Committee on Energy and Commerce and the Committee on
        Appropriations of the House of Representatives.
    (d) Small businesses; fee waiver and fee reduction regarding
      premarket approval fees
      (1) In general
        The Secretary shall grant a waiver of the fee required under
      subsection (a) of this section for one premarket application, or
      one premarket report, where the Secretary finds that the
      applicant involved is a small business submitting its first
      premarket application to the Secretary, or its first premarket
      report, respectively, for review. For the purposes of this
      paragraph, the term "small business" means an entity that
      reported $30,000,000 or less of gross receipts or sales in its
      most recent Federal income tax return for a taxable year,
      including such returns of all of its affiliates, partners, and
      parent firms. In addition, for subsequent premarket applications,
      premarket reports, and supplements where the Secretary finds that
      the applicant involved is a small business, the fees specified in
      clauses (i) through (vi) of subsection (a)(2)(A) of this section
      may be paid at a reduced rate in accordance with paragraph
      (2)(C).
      (2) Rules relating to premarket approval fees
        (A) Definition
            For purposes of this paragraph, the term "small business"
          means an entity that reported $100,000,000 or less of gross
          receipts or sales in its most recent Federal income tax
          return for a taxable year, including such returns of all of
          its affiliates, partners, and parent firms.
        (B) Evidence of qualification
          An applicant shall pay the higher fees established by the
        Secretary each year unless the applicant submits evidence that
        it qualifies for a waiver of the fee or the lower fee rate. The
        applicant shall support its claim that it meets the definition
        under subparagraph (A) by submission of a copy of its most
        recent Federal income tax return for a taxable year, and a copy
        of such returns of its affiliates, partners, and parent firms,
        which show an amount of gross sales or receipts that is less
        than the maximum established in subparagraph (A). The
        applicant, and each of such affiliates, partners, and parent
        firms, shall certify that the information provided is a true
        and accurate copy of the actual tax forms they submitted to the
        Internal Revenue Service. If no tax forms are submitted for
        affiliates, partners, or parent firms, the applicant shall
        certify that the applicant has no affiliates, partners, or
        parent firms, respectively.
        (C) Reduced fees
          Where the Secretary finds that the applicant involved meets
        the definition under subparagraph (A), the fees established
        under subsection (c)(1) of this section may be paid at a
        reduced rate of 38 percent of the fee established under such
        subsection for a premarket application, a premarket report, or
        a supplement.
        (D) Request for fee waiver or reduction
          An applicant seeking a fee waiver or reduction under this
        subsection shall submit supporting information to the Secretary
        at least 60 days before the fee is required pursuant to
        subsection (a) of this section. The decision of the Secretary
        regarding whether an entity qualifies for such a waiver or
        reduction is not reviewable.
    (e) Small businesses; fee reduction regarding premarket
      notification submissions
      (1) In general
        For fiscal year 2004 and each subsequent fiscal year, where the
      Secretary finds that the applicant involved is a small business,
      the fee specified in subsection (a)(2)(A)(vii) of this section
      may be paid at a reduced rate in accordance with paragraph
      (2)(C).
      (2) Rules relating to premarket notification submissions
        (A) Definition
          For purposes of this subsection, the term "small business"
        means an entity that reported $100,000,000 or less of gross
        receipts or sales in its most recent Federal income tax return
        for a taxable year, including such returns of all of its
        affiliates, partners, and parent firms.
        (B) Evidence of qualification
          An applicant shall pay the higher fees established by the
        Secretary each year unless the applicant submits evidence that
        it qualifies for the lower fee rate. The applicant shall
        support its claim that it meets the definition under
        subparagraph (A) by submission of a copy of its most recent
        Federal income tax return for a taxable year, and a copy of
        such returns of its affiliates, partners, and parent firms,
        which show an amount of gross sales or receipts that is less
        than the maximum established in subparagraph (A). The
        applicant, and each of such affiliates, partners, and parent
        firms, shall certify that the information provided is a true
        and accurate copy of the actual tax forms they submitted to the
        Internal Revenue Service. If no tax forms are submitted for
        affiliates, partners, or parent firms, the applicant shall
        certify that the applicant has no affiliates, partners, or
        parent firms, respectively.
        (C) Reduced fees
          (i) In general
            For fiscal year 2004 and each subsequent fiscal year, where
          the Secretary finds that the applicant involved meets the
          definition under subparagraph (A), the fee for a premarket
          notification submission may be paid at 80 percent of the fee
          that applies under subsection (a)(2)(A)(vii) of this section,
          as adjusted under clause (ii) and as established under
          subsection (c)(1) of this section.
          (ii) Adjustment per fee revenue amount
            For fiscal year 2004 and each subsequent fiscal year, the
          Secretary, in setting the revenue amount under subsection
          (c)(1) of this section for premarket notification
          submissions, shall determine the revenue amount that would
          apply if all such submissions for the fiscal year involved
          paid a fee equal to 1.42 percent of the amount that applies
          under subsection (a)(2)(A)(i) of this section for premarket
          applications, and shall adjust the fee under subsection
          (a)(2)(A)(vii) of this section for premarket notification
          submissions such that the reduced fees collected under clause
          (i) of this subparagraph, when added to fees for such
          submissions that are not paid at the reduced rate, will equal
          such revenue amount for the fiscal year.
        (D) Request for reduction
          An applicant seeking a fee reduction under this subsection
        shall submit supporting information to the Secretary at least
        60 days before the fee is required pursuant to subsection (a)
        of this section. The decision of the Secretary regarding
        whether an entity qualifies for such a reduction is not
        reviewable.
    (f) Effect of failure to pay fees
      A premarket application, premarket report, supplement, or
    premarket notification submission submitted by a person subject to
    fees under subsection (a) of this section shall be considered
    incomplete and shall not be accepted by the Secretary until all
    fees owed by such person have been paid.

        program after fiscal year 2005

        year, the following applies:
            (I) The Secretary is expected to meet such goals to the
          extent practicable, taking into account the amounts that are

          fees under subsection (a) of this section or otherwise.
            (II) The Comptroller General of the United States shall

        adjustment factor applicable to the fiscal year.
          (ii) For fiscal year 2005, if the amount so appropriated for
        such fiscal year, excluding the amount of fees appropriated for
        such fiscal year, is more than 1 percent less than the amount
        that applies under clause (i), the following applies:
            (I) The Secretary is expected to meet such goals to the
          extent practicable, taking into account the amounts that are

            (II) The Comptroller General of the United States shall
          submit to the Congress a report describing whether and to
          what extent the Secretary is meeting the performance goals
          identified for such fiscal year, and whether the Secretary

          fiscal year 2006. The report under the preceding sentence
          shall be submitted to the Congress not later than July 1,
          2005.

          (C) For fiscal year 2006, fees may not be assessed under
        subsection (a) of this section for the fiscal year, and the
        Secretary is not expected to meet any performance goals
        identified for the fiscal year, if the total of the amounts so
        appropriated for fiscal years 2005 and 2006, excluding the
        amount of fees appropriated for such fiscal years, is more than
        1 percent less than the sum of - 
            (i) $205,720,000 multiplied by the adjustment factor
          applicable to fiscal year 2006; and
            (ii) an amount equal to the amount that applies for
          purposes of subparagraph (B)(i).

        Secretary is not expected to meet any performance goals
        identified for the fiscal year, if - 
            (i) the amount so appropriated for the fiscal year,
          excluding the amount of fees appropriated for the fiscal
          year, is more than 1 percent less than $205,720,000
          multiplied by the adjustment factor applicable to fiscal year
          2007; or
            (ii) pursuant to subparagraph (C), fees were not assessed
          under subsection (a) of this section for fiscal year 2006.
      (2) Authority
        If the Secretary does not assess fees under subsection (a) of
      this section during any portion of a fiscal year because of
      subparagraph (C) or (D) of paragraph (1) and if at a later date
      in such fiscal year the Secretary may assess such fees, the
      Secretary may assess and collect such fees, without any
      modification in the rate for premarket applications, supplements,
      premarket reports, and premarket notification submissions, and at
      any time in such fiscal year, notwithstanding the provisions of
      subsection (a) of this section relating to the date fees are to
      be paid.
    (h) Crediting and availability of fees
      (1) In general
        Fees authorized under subsection (a) of this section shall be
      collected and available for obligation only to the extent and in
      the amount provided in advance in appropriation Acts. Such fees
      are authorized to be appropriated to remain available until
      expended. Such sums as may be necessary may be transferred from
      the Food and Drug Administration salaries and expenses
      appropriation account without fiscal year limitation to such
      appropriation account for salaries and expenses with such fiscal
      year limitation. The sums transferred shall be available solely
      for the process for the review of device applications.
      (2) Collections and appropriation acts
        (A) In general
          The fees authorized by this section - 
            (i) shall be retained in each fiscal year in an amount not
          to exceed the amount specified in appropriation Acts, or
          otherwise made available for obligation, for such fiscal
          year, and
            (ii) shall only be collected and available to defray
          increases in the costs of the resources allocated for the
          process for the review of device applications (including
          increases in such costs for an additional number of full-time
          equivalent positions in the Department of Health and Human
          Services to be engaged in such process) over such costs,
          excluding costs paid from fees collected under this section,
          for fiscal year 2002 multiplied by the adjustment factor.
        (B) Compliance
          (i) In general
            The Secretary shall be considered to have met the
          requirements of subparagraph (A)(ii) in any fiscal year if
          the costs funded by appropriations and allocated for the
          process for the review of device applications - 
              (I) are not more than 3 percent below the level specified
            in subparagraph (A)(ii); or
              (II)(aa) are more than 3 percent below the level
            specified in subparagraph (A)(ii), and fees assessed for a
            subsequent fiscal year are decreased by the amount in
            excess of 3 percent by which such costs fell below the
            level specified in such subparagraph; and
              (bb) such costs are not more than 5 percent below the
            level specified in such subparagraph.
          (ii) More than 5 percent
            To the extent such costs are more than 5 percent below the
          specified level in subparagraph (A)(ii), fees may not be
          collected under this section for that fiscal year.
      (3) Authorization of appropriations
        There are authorized to be appropriated for fees under this
      section - 
          (A) $25,125,000 for fiscal year 2003;
          (B) $27,255,000 for fiscal year 2004;
          (C) $29,785,000 for fiscal year 2005; and
          (D) such sums as may be necessary for each of fiscal years
        2006 and 2007.(!2)


      as adjusted to reflect adjustments in the total fee revenues made
      under this section and changes in the total amounts collected by
      application fees.
      (4) Offset
        Any amount of fees collected for a fiscal year under this
      section that exceeds the amount of fees specified in
      appropriation Acts for such fiscal year shall be credited to the
      appropriation account of the Food and Drug Administration as
      provided in paragraph (1), and shall be subtracted from the
      amount of fees that would otherwise be authorized to be collected
      under this section pursuant to appropriation Acts for a
      subsequent fiscal year.
    (i) Collection of unpaid fees
      In any case where the Secretary does not receive payment of a fee
    assessed under subsection (a) of this section within 30 days after
    it is due, such fee shall be treated as a claim of the United
    States Government subject to subchapter II of chapter 37 of title
    31.
    (j) Written requests for refunds
      To qualify for consideration for a refund under subsection
    (a)(2)(D) of this section, a person shall submit to the Secretary a
    written request for such refund not later than 180 days after such
    fee is due.
    (k) Construction
      This section may not be construed to require that the number of
    full-time equivalent positions in the Department of Health and
    Human Services, for officers, employees, and advisory committees
    not engaged in the process of the review of device applications, be
    reduced to offset the number of officers, employees, and advisory
    committees so engaged.

      shall pay for each such animal drug product the annual fee
      established in subsection (b) of this section. Such fee shall be
      payable for the fiscal year in which the animal drug product is
      first submitted for listing under section 360 of this title, or
      is submitted for relisting under section 360 of this title if the
      animal drug product has been withdrawn from listing and relisted.
      After such fee is paid for that fiscal year, such fee shall be
      payable on or before January 31 of each year. Such fee shall be
      paid only once for each animal drug product for a fiscal year in
      which the fee is payable.
      (3) Animal drug establishment fee
        Each person - 
          (A) who owns or operates, directly or through an affiliate,
        an animal drug establishment, and
          (B) who is named as the applicant in an animal drug
        application or supplemental animal drug application for an
        animal drug product which has been submitted for listing under
        section 360 of this title, and
          (C) who, after September 1, 2003, had pending before the
        Secretary an animal drug application or supplemental animal
        drug application,

      shall be assessed an annual fee established in subsection (b) of
      this section for each animal drug establishment listed in its
      approved animal drug application as an establishment that
      manufactures the animal drug product named in the application.
      The annual establishment fee shall be assessed in each fiscal
      year in which the animal drug product named in the application is
      assessed a fee under paragraph (2) unless the animal drug
      establishment listed in the application does not engage in the
      manufacture of the animal drug product during the fiscal year.
      The fee shall be paid on or before January 31 of each year. The
      establishment shall be assessed only one fee per fiscal year
      under this section: Provided, however, that where a single
      establishment manufactures both animal drug products and
      prescription drug products, as defined in section 379g(3) of this
      title, such establishment shall be assessed both the animal drug
      establishment fee and the prescription drug establishment fee, as
      set forth in section 379h(a)(2) of this title, within a single
      fiscal year.
      (4) Animal drug sponsor fee
        Each person - 
          (A) who meets the definition of an animal drug sponsor within
        a fiscal year; and
          (B) who, after September 1, 2003, had pending before the
        Secretary an animal drug application, a supplemental animal
        drug application, or an investigational animal drug submission,

      shall be assessed an annual fee established under subsection (b)
      of this section. The fee shall be paid on or before January 31 of
      each year. Each animal drug sponsor shall pay only one such fee
      each fiscal year.
    (b) Fee amounts
      Except as provided in subsection (a)(1) of this section and
    subsections (c), (d), (f), and (g) of this section, the fees
    required under subsection (a) of this section shall be established
    to generate fee revenue amounts as follows:
      (1) Total fee revenues for application and supplement fees
        The total fee revenues to be collected in animal drug
      application fees under subsection (a)(1)(A)(i) of this section
      and supplemental animal drug application fees under subsection
      (a)(1)(A)(ii) of this section shall be $1,250,000 in fiscal year
      2004, $2,000,000 in fiscal year 2005, and $2,500,000 in fiscal
      years 2006, 2007, and 2008.
      (2) Total fee revenues for product fees
        The total fee revenues to be collected in product fees under
      subsection (a)(2) of this section shall be $1,250,000 in fiscal
      year 2004, $2,000,000 in fiscal year 2005, and $2,500,000 in
      fiscal years 2006, 2007, and 2008.
      (3) Total fee revenues for establishment fees
        The total fee revenues to be collected in establishment fees
      under subsection (a)(3) of this section shall be $1,250,000 in
      fiscal year 2004, $2,000,000 in fiscal year 2005, and $2,500,000
      in fiscal years 2006, 2007, and 2008.
      (4) Total fee revenues for sponsor fees
        The total fee revenues to be collected in sponsor fees under
      subsection (a)(4) of this section shall be $1,250,000 in fiscal
      year 2004, $2,000,000 in fiscal year 2005, and $2,500,000 in
      fiscal years 2006, 2007, and 2008.
    (c) Adjustments
      (1) Inflation adjustment
        The revenues established in subsection (b) of this section
      shall be adjusted by the Secretary by notice, published in the
      Federal Register, for a fiscal year to reflect the greater of - 
          (A) the total percentage change that occurred in the Consumer
        Price Index for all urban consumers (all items; United States
        city average) for the 12-month period ending June 30 preceding
        the fiscal year for which fees are being established; or
          (B) the total percentage change for the previous fiscal year
        in basic pay under the General Schedule in accordance with
        section 5332 of title 5, as adjusted by any locality-based
        comparability payment pursuant to section 5304 of such title
        for Federal employees stationed in the District of Columbia.

      The adjustment made each fiscal year by this subsection will be
      added on a compounded basis to the sum of all adjustments made
      each fiscal year after fiscal year 2004 under this subsection.
      (2) Workload adjustment
        After the fee revenues are adjusted for inflation in accordance
      with paragraph (1), the fee revenues shall be further adjusted
      each fiscal year after fiscal year 2004 to reflect changes in
      review workload. With respect to such adjustment:
          (A) This adjustment shall be determined by the Secretary
        based on a weighted average of the change in the total number
        of animal drug applications, supplemental animal drug
        applications for which data with respect to safety or
        effectiveness are required, manufacturing supplemental animal
        drug applications, investigational animal drug study
        submissions, and investigational animal drug protocol
        submissions submitted to the Secretary. The Secretary shall
        publish in the Federal Register the fees resulting from this
        adjustment and the supporting methodologies.
          (B) Under no circumstances shall this workload adjustment
        result in fee revenues for a fiscal year that are less than the
        fee revenues for that fiscal year established in subsection (b)
        of this section, as adjusted for inflation under paragraph (1).
      (3) Final year adjustment
        For fiscal year 2008, the Secretary may further increase the
      fees to provide for up to 3 months of operating reserves of
      carryover user fees for the process for the review of animal drug
      applications for the first 3 months of fiscal year 2009. If the
      Food and Drug Administration has carryover balances for the
      process for the review of animal drug applications in excess of 3
      months of such operating reserves, then this adjustment will not
      be made. If this adjustment is necessary, then the rationale for
      the amount of the increase shall be contained in the annual
      notice setting fees for fiscal year 2008.
      (4) Annual fee setting
        The Secretary shall establish, 60 days before the start of each
      fiscal year beginning after September 30, 2003, for that fiscal
      year, animal drug application fees, supplemental animal drug
      application fees, animal drug sponsor fees, animal drug
      establishment fees, and animal drug product fees based on the
      revenue amounts established under subsection (b) of this section
      and the adjustments provided under this subsection.
      (5) Limit
        The total amount of fees charged, as adjusted under this
      subsection, for a fiscal year may not exceed the total costs for
      such fiscal year for the resources allocated for the process for
      the review of animal drug applications.
    (d) Fee waiver or reduction
      (1) In general
        The Secretary shall grant a waiver from or a reduction of 1 or
      more fees assessed under subsection (a) of this section where the
      Secretary finds that - 
          (A) the assessment of the fee would present a significant
        barrier to innovation because of limited resources available to
        such person or other circumstances,
          (B) the fees to be paid by such person will exceed the
        anticipated present and future costs incurred by the Secretary
        in conducting the process for the review of animal drug
        applications for such person,
          (C) the animal drug application or supplemental animal drug
        application is intended solely to provide for use of the animal
        drug in - 
            (i) a Type B medicated feed (as defined in section
          558.3(b)(3) of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (or any
          successor regulation)) intended for use in the manufacture of
          Type C free-choice medicated feeds, or
            (ii) a Type C free-choice medicated feed (as defined in
          section 558.3(b)(4) of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations
          (or any successor regulation)),

          (D) the animal drug application or supplemental animal drug
        application is intended solely to provide for a minor use or
        minor species indication, or
          (E) the sponsor involved is a small business submitting its
        first animal drug application to the Secretary for review.
      (2) Use of standard costs
        In making the finding in paragraph (1)(B), the Secretary may
      use standard costs.
      (3) Rules for small businesses
        (A) Definition
          In paragraph (1)(E), the term "small business" means an
        entity that has fewer than 500 employees, including employees
        of affiliates.
        (B) Waiver of application fee
          The Secretary shall waive under paragraph (1)(E) the
        application fee for the first animal drug application that a
        small business or its affiliate submits to the Secretary for
        review. After a small business or its affiliate is granted such
        a waiver, the small business or its affiliate shall pay
        application fees for all subsequent animal drug applications
        and supplemental animal drug applications for which safety or
        effectiveness data are required in the same manner as an entity
        that does not qualify as a small business.
        (C) Certification
          The Secretary shall require any person who applies for a
        waiver under paragraph (1)(E) to certify their qualification
        for the waiver. The Secretary shall periodically publish in the
        Federal Register a list of persons making such certifications.
    (e) Effect of failure to pay fees
      An animal drug application or supplemental animal drug
    application submitted by a person subject to fees under subsection
    (a) of this section shall be considered incomplete and shall not be
    accepted for filing by the Secretary until all fees owed by such
    person have been paid. An investigational animal drug submission
    under section 379j-11(5)(B) of this title that is submitted by a
    person subject to fees under subsection (a) of this section shall
    be considered incomplete and shall not be accepted for review by
    the Secretary until all fees owed by such person have been paid.
    The Secretary may discontinue review of any animal drug
    application, supplemental animal drug application or
    investigational animal drug submission from a person if such person
    has not submitted for payment all fees owed under this section by
    30 days after the date upon which they are due.
    (f) Assessment of fees
      (1) Limitation
        Fees may not be assessed under subsection (a) of this section
      for a fiscal year beginning after fiscal year 2003 unless
      appropriations for salaries and expenses of the Food and Drug
      Administration for such fiscal year (excluding the amount of fees
      appropriated for such fiscal year) are equal to or greater than
      the amount of appropriations for the salaries and expenses of the
      Food and Drug Administration for the fiscal year 2003 (excluding
      the amount of fees appropriated for such fiscal year) multiplied
      by the adjustment factor applicable to the fiscal year involved.
      (2) Authority
        If the Secretary does not assess fees under subsection (a) of
      this section during any portion of a fiscal year because of
      paragraph (1) and if at a later date in such fiscal year the
      Secretary may assess such fees, the Secretary may assess and
      collect such fees, without any modification in the rate, for
      animal drug applications, supplemental animal drug applications,
      investigational animal drug submissions, animal drug sponsors,
      animal drug establishments and animal drug products at any time
      in such fiscal year notwithstanding the provisions of subsection
      (a) of this section relating to the date fees are to be paid.
    (g) Crediting and availability of fees
      (1) In general
        Fees authorized under subsection (a) of this section shall be
      collected and available for obligation only to the extent and in
      the amount provided in advance in appropriations Acts. Such fees
      are authorized to be appropriated to remain available until
      expended. Such sums as may be necessary may be transferred from
      the Food and Drug Administration salaries and expenses
      appropriation account without fiscal year limitation to such
      appropriation account for salary and expenses with such fiscal
      year limitation. The sums transferred shall be available solely
      for the process for the review of animal drug applications.
      (2) Collections and appropriation acts
        (A) In general
          The fees authorized by this section - 
            (i) shall be retained in each fiscal year in an amount not
          to exceed the amount specified in appropriation Acts, or
          otherwise made available for obligation for such fiscal year,
          and
            (ii) shall only be collected and available to defray
          increases in the costs of the resources allocated for the
          process for the review of animal drug applications (including
          increases in such costs for an additional number of full-time
          equivalent positions in the Department of Health and Human
          Services to be engaged in such process) over such costs,
          excluding costs paid from fees collected under this section,
          for fiscal year 2003 multiplied by the adjustment factor.
        (B) Compliance
          The Secretary shall be considered to have met the
        requirements of subparagraph (A)(ii) in any fiscal year if the
        costs funded by appropriations and allocated for the process
        for the review of animal drug applications - 
            (i) are not more than 3 percent below the level specified
          in subparagraph (A)(ii); or
            (ii)(I) are more than 3 percent below the level specified
          in subparagraph (A)(ii), and fees assessed for the fiscal
          year following the subsequent fiscal year are decreased by
          the amount in excess of 3 percent by which such costs fell
          below the level specified in subparagraph (A)(ii); and
            (II) such costs are not more than 5 percent below the level
          specified in subparagraph (A)(ii).
      (3) Authorization of appropriations
        There are authorized to be appropriated for fees under this
      section - 
          (A) $5,000,000 for fiscal year 2004;
          (B) $8,000,000 for fiscal year 2005;
          (C) $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2006;
          (D) $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2007; and
          (E) $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2008;

      as adjusted to reflect adjustments in the total fee revenues made
      under this section and changes in the total amounts collected by
      animal drug application fees, supplemental animal drug
      application fees, animal drug sponsor fees, animal drug
      establishment fees, and animal drug product fees.
      (4) Offset
        Any amount of fees collected for a fiscal year under this
      section that exceeds the amount of fees specified in
      appropriations Acts for such fiscal year shall be credited to the
      appropriation account of the Food and Drug Administration as
      provided in paragraph (1), and shall be subtracted from the
      amount of fees that would otherwise be authorized to be collected
      under this section pursuant to appropriation Acts for a
      subsequent fiscal year.
    (h) Collection of unpaid fees
      In any case where the Secretary does not receive payment of a fee
    assessed under subsection (a) of this section within 30 days after
    it is due, such fee shall be treated as a claim of the United
    States Government subject to subchapter II of chapter 37 of title
    31.
    (i) Written requests for waivers, reductions, and refunds
      To qualify for consideration for a waiver or reduction under
    subsection (d) of this section, or for a refund of any fee
    collected in accordance with subsection (a) of this section, a
    person shall submit to the Secretary a written request for such
    waiver, reduction, or refund not later than 180 days after such fee
    is due.
    (j) Construction
      This section may not be construed to require that the number of
    full-time equivalent positions in the Department of Health and
    Human Services, for officers, employees, and advisory committees
    not engaged in the process of the review of animal drug
    applications, be reduced to offset the number of officers,
    employees, and advisory committees so engaged.
    (k) Abbreviated new animal drug applications
      The Secretary shall - 
        (1) to the extent practicable, segregate the review of
      abbreviated new animal drug applications from the process for the
      review of animal drug applications, and
        (2) adopt other administrative procedures to ensure that review
      times of abbreviated new animal drug applications do not increase
      from their current level due to activities under the user fee
      program.

-STATUTE-
    (a) In general
      Except as provided in subsection (b), (c)(1), (d), (e), or (f) of
    this section, no State or political subdivision of a State may
    establish or continue in effect any requirement - 
        (1) that relates to the regulation of a drug that is not
      subject to the requirements of section 353(b)(1) or 353(f)(1)(A)
      of this title; and
        (2) that is different from or in addition to, or that is
      otherwise not identical with, a requirement under this chapter,
      the Poison Prevention Packaging Act of 1970 (15 U.S.C. 1471 et
      seq.), or the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (15 U.S.C. 1451 et
      seq.).
    (b) Exemption
      (1) In general
        Upon application of a State or political subdivision thereof,
      the Secretary may by regulation, after notice and opportunity for
      written and oral presentation of views, exempt from subsection
      (a) of this section, under such conditions as may be prescribed
      in such regulation, a State or political subdivision requirement
      that - 
          (A) protects an important public interest that would
        otherwise be unprotected, including the health and safety of
        children;
          (B) would not cause any drug to be in violation of any
        applicable requirement or prohibition under Federal law; and
          (C) would not unduly burden interstate commerce.
      (2) Timely action
        The Secretary shall make a decision on the exemption of a State
      or political subdivision requirement under paragraph (1) not
      later than 120 days after receiving the application of the State
      or political subdivision under paragraph (1).
    (c) Scope
      (1) In general
        This section shall not apply to - 
          (A) any State or political subdivision requirement that
        relates to the practice of pharmacy; or
          (B) any State or political subdivision requirement that a
        drug be dispensed only upon the prescription of a practitioner
        licensed by law to administer such drug.
      (2) Safety or effectiveness
        For purposes of subsection (a) of this section, a requirement
      that relates to the regulation of a drug shall be deemed to
      include any requirement relating to public information or any
      other form of public communication relating to a warning of any
      kind for a drug.
    (d) Exceptions
      (1) In general
        In the case of a drug described in subsection (a)(1) of this

      section 355 of this title or section 357 of this title (as in
      effect on the day before November 21, 1997) or a final regulation
      promulgated by the Secretary establishing conditions under which
      the drug is generally recognized as safe and effective and not
      misbranded, subsection (a) of this section shall apply only with
      respect to a requirement of a State or political subdivision of a
      State that relates to the same subject as, but is different from
      or in addition to, or that is otherwise not identical with - 
          (A) a regulation in effect with respect to the drug pursuant
        to a statute described in subsection (a)(2) of this section; or
          (B) any other requirement in effect with respect to the drug
        pursuant to an amendment to such a statute made on or after
        November 21, 1997.
      (2) State initiatives
        This section shall not apply to a State requirement adopted by
      a State public initiative or referendum enacted prior to
      September 1, 1997.
    (e) No effect on product liability law
      Nothing in this section shall be construed to modify or otherwise
    affect any action or the liability of any person under the product
    liability law of any State.
    (f) State enforcement authority

      (commonly referred to as the "Privacy Act of 1974") and a medical
      or similar file the disclosure of which would constitute a

      the "Freedom of Information Act"), and shall not be publicly
      disclosed unless all personally identifiable information is
      redacted.
    (g) Rule of construction
      The submission of any adverse event report in compliance with

    event.

      (1) In general
        No State or local government shall establish or continue in
      effect any law, regulation, order, or other requirement, related

            (i) be made publicly available pursuant to any State or
          other law requiring disclosure of information or records; or
            (ii) otherwise be disclosed or distributed to any party
          without the written consent of the Secretary and the person
          submitting such information to the Secretary.

            (ii) been duly designated by the Secretary to have access
          to the records required under this section.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Imports; list of registered foreign establishments; samples
      from unregistered foreign establishments; examination and refusal
      of admission
      The Secretary of the Treasury shall deliver to the Secretary of
    Health and Human Services, upon his request, samples of food,
    drugs, devices, and cosmetics which are being imported or offered
    for import into the United States, giving notice thereof to the
    owner or consignee, who may appear before the Secretary of Health
    and Human Services and have the right to introduce testimony. The
    Secretary of Health and Human Services shall furnish to the
    Secretary of the Treasury a list of establishments registered
    pursuant to subsection (i) of section 360 of this title and shall
    request that if any drugs and devices manufactured, prepared,
    propagated, compounded, or processed in an establishment not so
    registered are imported or offered for import into the United
    States, samples of such drugs and devices be delivered to the
    Secretary of Health and Human Services, with notice of such
    delivery to the owner or consignee, who may appear before the
    Secretary of Health and Human Services and have the right to
    introduce testimony. If it appears from the examination of such
    samples or otherwise that (1) such article has been manufactured,
    processed, or packed under insanitary conditions or, in the case of
    a device, the methods used in, or the facilities or controls used
    for, the manufacture, packing, storage, or installation of the
    device do not conform to the requirements of section 360j(f) of
    this title, or (2) such article is forbidden or restricted in sale
    in the country in which it was produced or from which it was
    exported, or (3) such article is adulterated, misbranded, or in
    violation of section 355 of this title, then such article shall be
    refused admission, except as provided in subsection (b) of this
    section. If such article is subject to a requirement under section
    379aa or 379aa-1 of this title and if the Secretary has credible
    evidence or information indicating that the responsible person (as
    defined in such section 379aa or 379aa-1 of this title) has not
    complied with a requirement of such section 379aa or 379aa-1 of
    this title with respect to any such article, or has not allowed
    access to records described in such section 379aa or 379aa-1 of
    this title, then such article shall be refused admission, except as
    provided in subsection (b) of this section. The Secretary of the
    Treasury shall cause the destruction of any such article refused
    admission unless such article is exported, under regulations
    prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, within ninety days of
    the date of notice of such refusal or within such additional time
    as may be permitted pursuant to such regulations. Clause (2) of the
    third sentence of this paragraph (!1) shall not be construed to
    prohibit the admission of narcotic drugs the importation of which
    is permitted under the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act
    [21 U.S.C. 951 et seq.].

    (b) Disposition of refused articles
      Pending decision as to the admission of an article being imported
    or offered for import, the Secretary of the Treasury may authorize
    delivery of such article to the owner or consignee upon the
    execution by him of a good and sufficient bond providing for the
    payment of such liquidated damages in the event of default as may
    be required pursuant to regulations of the Secretary of the
    Treasury. If it appears to the Secretary of Health and Human
    Services that (1) an article included within the provisions of
    clause (3) of subsection (a) of this section can, by relabeling or
    other action, be brought into compliance with this chapter or
    rendered other than a food, drug, device, or cosmetic, or (2) with
    respect to an article included within the provision of the fourth
    sentence of subsection (a), the responsible person (as defined in
    section 379aa or 379aa-1 of this title) can take action that would
    assure that the responsible person is in compliance with section
    379aa or 379aa-1 of this title, as the case may be, final
    determination as to admission of such article may be deferred and,
    upon filing of timely written application by the owner or consignee
    and the execution by him of a bond as provided in the preceding
    provisions of this subsection, the Secretary may, in accordance
    with regulations, authorize the applicant, or, with respect to
    clause (2), the responsible person, to perform such relabeling or
    other action specified in such authorization (including destruction
    or export of rejected articles or portions thereof, as may be
    specified in the Secretary's authorization). All such relabeling or
    other action pursuant to such authorization shall in accordance
    with regulations be under the supervision of an officer or employee
    of the Department of Health and Human Services designated by the
    Secretary, or an officer or employee of the Department of the
    Treasury designated by the Secretary of the Treasury.
    (c) Charges concerning refused articles
      All expenses (including travel, per diem or subsistence, and
    salaries of officers or employees of the United States) in
    connection with the destruction provided for in subsection (a) of
    this section and the supervision of the relabeling or other action
    authorized under the provisions of subsection (b) of this section,
    the amount of such expenses to be determined in accordance with
    regulations, and all expenses in connection with the storage,
    cartage, or labor with respect to any article refused admission
    under subsection (a) of this section, shall be paid by the owner or
    consignee and, in default of such payment, shall constitute a lien
    against any future importations made by such owner or consignee.
    (d) Reimportation
      (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) and section 384 of this
    title, no drug subject to section 353(b) of this title or composed
    wholly or partly of insulin which is manufactured in a State and
    exported may be imported into the United States unless the drug is
    imported by the manufacturer of the drug.
      (2) The Secretary may authorize the importation of a drug the
    importation of which is prohibited by paragraph (1) if the drug is
    required for emergency medical care.
      (3)(A) Subject to subparagraph (B), no component of a drug, no
    component part or accessory of a device, or other article of device
    requiring further processing, which is ready or suitable for use
    for health-related purposes, and no article of a food additive,
    color additive, or dietary supplement, including a product in bulk
    form, shall be excluded from importation into the United States
    under subsection (a) of this section if each of the following
    conditions is met:
        (i) The importer of such article of a drug or device or
      importer of such article of a food additive, color additive, or
      dietary supplement submits to the Secretary, at the time of
      initial importation, a statement in accordance with the
      following:
          (I) Such statement provides that such article is intended to
        be further processed by the initial owner or consignee, or
        incorporated by the initial owner or consignee, into a drug,
        biological product, device, food, food additive, color
        additive, or dietary supplement that will be exported by the
        initial owner or consignee from the United States in accordance
        with subsection (e) of this section or section 382 of this
        title, or with section 262(h) of title 42.
          (II) The statement identifies the manufacturer of such
        article and each processor, packer, distributor, or other
        entity that had possession of the article in the chain of
        possession of the article from the manufacturer to such
        importer of the article.
          (III) The statement is accompanied by such certificates of
        analysis as are necessary to identify such article, unless the
        article is a device or is an article described in paragraph
        (4).

        (ii) At the time of initial importation and before the delivery
      of such article to the importer or the initial owner or
      consignee, such owner or consignee executes a good and sufficient
      bond providing for the payment of such liquidated damages in the
      event of default as may be required pursuant to regulations of
      the Secretary of the Treasury.
        (iii) Such article is used and exported by the initial owner or
      consignee in accordance with the intent described under clause
      (i)(I), except for any portions of the article that are
      destroyed.
        (iv) The initial owner or consignee maintains records on the
      use or destruction of such article or portions thereof, as the
      case may be, and submits to the Secretary any such records
      requested by the Secretary.
        (v) Upon request of the Secretary, the initial owner or
      consignee submits a report that provides an accounting of the
      exportation or destruction of such article or portions thereof,
      and the manner in which such owner or consignee complied with the
      requirements of this subparagraph.

      (B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the Secretary may refuse
    admission to an article that otherwise would be imported into the
    United States under such subparagraph if the Secretary determines
    that there is credible evidence or information indicating that such
    article is not intended to be further processed by the initial
    owner or consignee, or incorporated by the initial owner or
    consignee, into a drug, biological product, device, food, food
    additive, color additive, or dietary supplement that will be
    exported by the initial owner or consignee from the United States
    in accordance with subsection (e) of this section or section 382 of
    this title, or with section 262(h) of title 42.
      (C) This section may not be construed as affecting the
    responsibility of the Secretary to ensure that articles imported
    into the United States under authority of subparagraph (A) meet
    each of the conditions established in such subparagraph for
    importation.
      (4) The importation into the United States of blood, blood
    components, source plasma, or source leukocytes or of a component,
    accessory, or part thereof is not permitted pursuant to paragraph
    (3) unless the importation complies with section 262(a) of title 42
    or the Secretary permits the importation under appropriate
    circumstances and conditions, as determined by the Secretary. The
    importation of tissue or a component or part of tissue is not
    permitted pursuant to paragraph (3) unless the importation complies
    with section 264 of title 42.
    (e) Exports
      (1) A food, drug, device, or cosmetic intended for export shall
    not be deemed to be adulterated or misbranded under this chapter if
    it - 
        (A) accords to the specifications of the foreign purchaser,
        (B) is not in conflict with the laws of the country to which it
      is intended for export,
        (C) is labeled on the outside of the shipping package that it
      is intended for export, and
        (D) is not sold or offered for sale in domestic commerce.

      (2) Paragraph (1) does not apply to any device - 
        (A) which does not comply with an applicable requirement of
      section 360d or 360e of this title,
        (B) which under section 360j(g) of this title is exempt from
      either such section, or
        (C) which is a banned device under section 360f of this title,

    unless, in addition to the requirements of paragraph (1), either
    (i) the Secretary has determined that the exportation of the device
    is not contrary to public health and safety and has the approval of
    the country to which it is intended for export or (ii) the device
    is eligible for export under section 382 of this title.
      (3) A new animal drug that requires approval under section 360b
    of this title shall not be exported pursuant to paragraph (1) if
    such drug has been banned in the United States.
      (4)(A) Any person who exports a drug, animal drug, or device may
    request that the Secretary - 
        (i) certify in writing that the exported drug, animal drug, or
      device meets the requirements of paragraph (1) or section 382 of
      this title; or
        (ii) certify in writing that the drug, animal drug, or device
      being exported meets the applicable requirements of this chapter
      upon a showing that the drug or device meets the applicable
      requirements of this chapter.

    The Secretary shall issue such a certification within 20 days of
    the receipt of a request for such certification.
      (B) If the Secretary issues a written export certification within
    the 20 days prescribed by subparagraph (A), a fee for such
    certification may be charged but shall not exceed $175 for each
    certification. Fees collected for a fiscal year pursuant to this
    subparagraph shall be credited to the appropriation account for
    salaries and expenses of the Food and Drug Administration and shall
    be available in accordance with appropriations Acts until expended
    without fiscal year limitation. Such fees shall be collected in
    each fiscal year in an amount equal to the amount specified in
    appropriations Acts for such fiscal year and shall only be
    collected and available for the costs of the Food and Drug
    Administration.
    (f) Labeling of exported drugs
      (1) If a drug (other than insulin, an antibiotic drug, an animal
    drug, or a drug exported under section 382 of this title) being
    exported in accordance with subsection (e) of this section is being
    exported to a country that has different or additional labeling
    requirements or conditions for use and such country requires the
    drug to be labeled in accordance with those requirements or uses,
    such drug may be labeled in accordance with such requirements and
    conditions for use in the country to which such drug is being
    exported if it also is labeled in accordance with the requirements
    of this chapter.
      (2) If, pursuant to paragraph (1), the labeling of an exported
    drug includes conditions for use that have not been approved under
    this chapter, the labeling must state that such conditions for use
    have not been approved under this chapter. A drug exported under
    section 382 of this title is exempt from this section.
    (g) Warning notice of importation in violation of chapter
      (1) With respect to a prescription drug being imported or offered
    for import into the United States, the Secretary, in the case of an
    individual who is not in the business of such importations, may not
    send a warning notice to the individual unless the following
    conditions are met:
        (A) The notice specifies, as applicable to the importation of
      the drug, that the Secretary has made a determination that - 
          (i) importation is in violation of subsection (a) of this
        section because the drug is or appears to be adulterated,
        misbranded, or in violation of section 355 of this title;
          (ii) importation is in violation of subsection (a) of this
        section because the drug is or appears to be forbidden or
        restricted in sale in the country in which it was produced or
        from which it was exported;
          (iii) importation is or appears to be in violation of
        subsection (d)(1) of this section; or
          (iv) importation otherwise is or appears to be in violation
        of Federal law.

        (B) The notice does not specify any provision described in
      subparagraph (A) that is not applicable to the importation of the
      drug.
        (C) The notice states the reasons underlying such determination
      by the Secretary, including a brief application to the principal
      facts involved of the provision of law described in subparagraph
      (A) that is the basis of the determination by the Secretary.

      (2) For purposes of this section, the term "warning notice", with
    respect to the importation of a drug, means a communication from
    the Secretary (written or otherwise) notifying a person, or clearly
    suggesting to the person, that importing the drug for personal use
    is, or appears to be, a violation of this chapter.
    (h) Protection against adulteration of food
      (1) The Secretary shall give high priority to increasing the
    number of inspections under this section for the purpose of
    enabling the Secretary to inspect food offered for import at ports
    of entry into the United States, with the greatest priority given
    to inspections to detect the intentional adulteration of food.
      (2) The Secretary shall give high priority to making necessary
    improvements to the information management systems of the Food and
    Drug Administration that contain information related to foods
    imported or offered for import into the United States for purposes
    of improving the ability of the Secretary to allocate resources,
    detect the intentional adulteration of food, and facilitate the
    importation of food that is in compliance with this chapter.
      (3) The Secretary shall improve linkages with other regulatory
    agencies of the Federal Government that share responsibility for
    food safety, and shall with respect to such safety improve linkages
    with the States and Indian tribes (as defined in section 450b(e) of
    title 25).
    (i) Testing for rapid detection of adulteration of food
      (1) For use in inspections of food under this section, the
    Secretary shall provide for research on the development of tests
    and sampling methodologies - 
        (A) whose purpose is to test food in order to rapidly detect
      the adulteration of the food, with the greatest priority given to
      detect the intentional adulteration of food; and
        (B) whose results offer significant improvements over the
      available technology in terms of accuracy, timing, or costs.

      (2) In providing for research under paragraph (1), the Secretary
    shall give priority to conducting research on the development of
    tests that are suitable for inspections of food at ports of entry
    into the United States.
      (3) In providing for research under paragraph (1), the Secretary
    shall as appropriate coordinate with the Director of the Centers
    for Disease Control and Prevention, the Director of the National
    Institutes of Health, the Administrator of the Environmental
    Protection Agency, and the Secretary of Agriculture.
      (4) The Secretary shall annually submit to the Committee on
    Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives, and the
    Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate,
    a report describing the progress made in research under paragraph
    (1), including progress regarding paragraph (2).
    (j) Temporary holds at ports of entry
      (1) If an officer or qualified employee of the Food and Drug
    Administration has credible evidence or information indicating that
    an article of food presents a threat of serious adverse health
    consequences or death to humans or animals, and such officer or
    qualified employee is unable to inspect, examine, or investigate
    such article upon the article being offered for import at a port of
    entry into the United States, the officer or qualified employee
    shall request the Secretary of Treasury to hold the food at the
    port of entry for a reasonable period of time, not to exceed 24
    hours, for the purpose of enabling the Secretary to inspect,
    examine, or investigate the article as appropriate.
      (2) The Secretary shall request the Secretary of Treasury to
    remove an article held pursuant to paragraph (1) to a secure
    facility, as appropriate. During the period of time that such
    article is so held, the article shall not be transferred by any
    person from the port of entry into the United States for the
    article, or from the secure facility to which the article has been
    removed, as the case may be. Subsection (b) of this section does
    not authorize the delivery of the article pursuant to the execution
    of a bond while the article is so held.
      (3) An officer or qualified employee of the Food and Drug
    Administration may make a request under paragraph (1) only if the
    Secretary or an official designated by the Secretary approves the
    request. An official may not be so designated unless the official
    is the director of the district under this chapter in which the
    article involved is located, or is an official senior to such
    director.
      (4) With respect to an article of food for which a request under
    paragraph (1) is made, the Secretary, promptly after the request is
    made, shall notify the State in which the port of entry involved is
    located that the request has been made, and as applicable, that
    such article is being held under this subsection.
    (k) Importation by debarred persons
      (1) If an article of food is being imported or offered for import
    into the United States, and the importer, owner, or consignee of
    the article is a person who has been debarred under section
    335a(b)(3) of this title, such article shall be held at the port of
    entry for the article, and may not be delivered to such person.
    Subsection (b) of this section does not authorize the delivery of
    the article pursuant to the execution of a bond while the article
    is so held. The article shall be removed to a secure facility, as
    appropriate. During the period of time that such article is so
    held, the article shall not be transferred by any person from the
    port of entry into the United States for the article, or from the
    secure facility to which the article has been removed, as the case
    may be.
      (2) An article of food held under paragraph (1) may be delivered
    to a person who is not a debarred person under section 335a(b)(3)
    of this title if such person affirmatively establishes, at the
    expense of the person, that the article complies with the
    requirements of this chapter, as determined by the Secretary.
    (l) Failure to register
      (1) (!2) If an article of food is being imported or offered for
    import into the United States, and such article is from a foreign
    facility for which a registration has not been submitted to the
    Secretary under section 350d of this title, such article shall be
    held at the port of entry for the article, and may not be delivered
    to the importer, owner, or consignee of the article, until the
    foreign facility is so registered. Subsection (b) of this section
    does not authorize the delivery of the article pursuant to the
    execution of a bond while the article is so held. The article shall
    be removed to a secure facility, as appropriate. During the period
    of time that such article is so held, the article shall not be
    transferred by any person from the port of entry into the United
    States for the article, or from the secure facility to which the
    article has been removed, as the case may be.

    (m) Prior notice of imported food shipments
      (1) In the case of an article of food that is being imported or
    offered for import into the United States, the Secretary, after
    consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, shall by
    regulation require, for the purpose of enabling such article to be
    inspected at ports of entry into the United States, the submission
    to the Secretary of a notice providing the identity of each of the
    following: The article; the manufacturer and shipper of the
    article; if known within the specified period of time that notice
    is required to be provided, the grower of the article; the country
    from which the article originates; the country from which the
    article is shipped; and the anticipated port of entry for the
    article. An article of food imported or offered for import without
    submission of such notice in accordance with the requirements under
    this paragraph shall be refused admission into the United States.
    Nothing in this section may be construed as a limitation on the
    port of entry for an article of food.
      (2)(A) Regulations under paragraph (1) shall require that a
    notice under such paragraph be provided by a specified period of
    time in advance of the time of the importation of the article of
    food involved or the offering of the food for import, which period
    shall be no less than the minimum amount of time necessary for the
    Secretary to receive, review, and appropriately respond to such
    notification, but may not exceed five days. In determining the
    specified period of time required under this subparagraph, the
    Secretary may consider, but is not limited to consideration of, the
    effect on commerce of such period of time, the locations of the
    various ports of entry into the United States, the various modes of
    transportation, the types of food imported into the United States,
    and any other such consideration. Nothing in the preceding sentence
    may be construed as a limitation on the obligation of the Secretary
    to receive, review, and appropriately respond to any notice under
    paragraph (1).
      (B)(i) If an article of food is being imported or offered for
    import into the United States and a notice under paragraph (1) is
    not provided in advance in accordance with the requirements under
    paragraph (1), such article shall be held at the port of entry for
    the article, and may not be delivered to the importer, owner, or
    consignee of the article, until such notice is submitted to the
    Secretary, and the Secretary examines the notice and determines
    that the notice is in accordance with the requirements under
    paragraph (1). Subsection (b) of this section does not authorize
    the delivery of the article pursuant to the execution of a bond
    while the article is so held. The article shall be removed to a
    secure facility, as appropriate. During the period of time that
    such article is so held, the article shall not be transferred by
    any person from the port of entry into the United States for the
    article, or from the secure facility to which the article has been
    removed, as the case may be.
      (ii) In carrying out clause (i) with respect to an article of
    food, the Secretary shall determine whether there is in the
    possession of the Secretary any credible evidence or information
    indicating that such article presents a threat of serious adverse
    health consequences or death to humans or animals.
      (3)(A) This subsection may not be construed as limiting the
    authority of the Secretary to obtain information under any other
    provision of this chapter.
      (B) This subsection may not be construed as authorizing the
    Secretary to impose any requirements with respect to a food to the
    extent that it is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the
    Secretary of Agriculture pursuant to the Federal Meat Inspection
    Act (21 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), the Poultry Products Inspection Act
    (21 U.S.C. 451 et seq.), or the Egg Products Inspection Act (21
    U.S.C. 1031 et seq.).
    (n) Labeling of food refused admission
      (1) If a food has been refused admission under subsection (a) of
    this section, other than such a food that is required to be
    destroyed, the Secretary may require the owner or consignee of the
    food to affix to the container of the food a label that clearly and
    conspicuously bears the statement: "UNITED STATES: REFUSED ENTRY".
      (2) All expenses in connection with affixing a label under
    paragraph (1) shall be paid by the owner or consignee of the food
    involved, and in default of such payment, shall constitute a lien
    against future importations made by such owner or consignee.
      (3) A requirement under paragraph (1) remains in effect until the
    Secretary determines that the food involved has been brought into
    compliance with this chapter.
    (o) Registration statement
      If an article that is a drug or device is being imported or
    offered for import into the United States, and the importer, owner,
    or consignee of such article does not, at the time of offering the
    article for import, submit to the Secretary a statement that
    identifies the registration under section 360(i) of this title of
    each establishment that with respect to such article is required
    under such section to register with the Secretary, the article may
    be refused admission. If the article is refused admission for
    failure to submit such a statement, the article shall be held at
    the port of entry for the article, and may not be delivered to the
    importer, owner, or consignee of the article, until such a
    statement is submitted to the Secretary. Subsection (b) of this
    section does not authorize the delivery of the article pursuant to
    the execution of a bond while the article is so held. The article
    shall be removed to a secure facility, as appropriate. During the
    period of time that such article is so held, the article shall not
    be transferred by any person from the port of entry into the United
    States for the article, or from the secure facility to which the
    article has been removed, as the case may be.

    approval of an application, be permitted to be exported if the
    Secretary finds that the drug or device will not expose patients in
    such country to an unreasonable risk of illness or injury and the
    probable benefit to health from the use of the drug or device
    (under conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in
    the labeling or proposed labeling of the drug or device) outweighs
    the risk of injury or illness from its use, taking into account the
    probable risks and benefits of currently available drug or device
    treatment.
      (2) The holder of an approved application for the export of a
    drug or device under this subsection shall report to the Secretary -

      paragraph; or
        (ii) the holder of an approved application under paragraph (1)
      has not made the report required by paragraph (2),

    the Secretary may, after providing the holder of the application an
    opportunity for an informal hearing, withdraw the approved

    or device from the United States to an importer and such importer
    is exporting the drug or device to a country for which the
    Secretary cannot make a finding under paragraph (1) and such export
    presents an imminent hazard, the Secretary shall immediately
    prohibit the export of the drug or device to such importer, provide
    the person exporting the drug or device from the United States
    prompt notice of the prohibition, and afford such person an
    opportunity for an expedited hearing.

      A drug or device may not be exported under this section - 
        (1) if the drug or device is not manufactured, processed,
      packaged, and held in substantial conformity with current good
      manufacturing practice requirements or does not meet
      international standards as certified by an international
      standards organization recognized by the Secretary;

        (4)(A) if the drug or device is the subject of a notice by the
      Secretary or the Secretary of Agriculture of a determination that
      the probability of reimportation of the exported drug or device
      would present an imminent hazard to the public health and safety
      of the United States and the only means of limiting the hazard is
      to prohibit the export of the drug or device; or
        (B) if the drug or device presents an imminent hazard to the
      public health of the country to which the drug or device would be
      exported;
        (5) if the labeling of the drug or device is not - 
          (A) in accordance with the requirements and conditions for
        use in - 
            (i) the country in which the drug or device received valid
          marketing authorization under subsection (b) of this section;

      the labeling requirements set forth in paragraph (5).

    In making a finding under paragraph (4)(B), (5), or (6) the
    Secretary shall consult with the appropriate public health official
    in the affected country.
    (g) Notification of Secretary
      The exporter of a drug or device exported under subsection (b)(1)
    of this section shall provide a simple notification to the
    Secretary identifying the drug or device when the exporter first
    begins to export such drug or device to any country listed in
    clause (i) or (ii) of subsection (b)(1)(A) of this section. When an
    exporter of a drug or device first begins to export a drug or
    device to a country which is not listed in clause (i) or (ii) of
    subsection (b)(1)A) (!1) of this section, the exporter shall

      laboratory;
        (2) if the tests are conducted by the importer -

          (B) that the information supplied under subparagraph (A) be
        kept in strict confidence and used only for purposes of testing
        or otherwise complying with this chapter; and

        (3) may include such additional provisions as the Secretary
      determines to be appropriate to provide for the protection of
      trade secrets and commercial or financial information that is
      privileged or confidential.
    (f) Registration of foreign sellers
      Any establishment within Canada engaged in the distribution of a
    prescription drug that is imported or offered for importation into
    the United States shall register with the Secretary the name and

    States agent for the establishment.
    (g) Suspension of importation
      The Secretary shall require that importations of a specific
    prescription drug or importations by a specific importer under
    subsection (b) of this section be immediately suspended on
    discovery of a pattern of importation of that specific prescription
    drug or by that specific importer of drugs that are counterfeit or
    in violation of any requirement under this section, until an
    investigation is completed and the Secretary determines that the
    public is adequately protected from counterfeit and violative
    prescription drugs being imported under subsection (b) of this
    section.
    (h) Approved labeling
      The manufacturer of a prescription drug shall provide an importer

    manufacturer of the drug to a charitable or humanitarian
    organization (including the United Nations and affiliates) or to a
    government of a foreign country.
    (j) Waiver authority for importation by individuals
      (1) Declarations
        Congress declares that in the enforcement against individuals
      of the prohibition of importation of prescription drugs and
      devices, the Secretary should - 
          (A) focus enforcement on cases in which the importation by an
        individual poses a significant threat to public health; and
          (B) exercise discretion to permit individuals to make such
        importations in circumstances in which - 
            (i) the importation is clearly for personal use; and
            (ii) the prescription drug or device imported does not
          appear to present an unreasonable risk to the individual.
      (2) Waiver authority
        (A) In general
          The Secretary may grant to individuals, by regulation or on a
        case-by-case basis, a waiver of the prohibition of importation
        of a prescription drug or device or class of prescription drugs
        or devices, under such conditions as the Secretary determines
        to be appropriate.
        (B) Guidance on case-by-case waivers
          The Secretary shall publish, and update as necessary,
        guidance that accurately describes circumstances in which the
        Secretary will consistently grant waivers on a case-by-case
        basis under subparagraph (A), so that individuals may know with
        the greatest practicable degree of certainty whether a
        particular importation for personal use will be permitted.
      (3) Drugs imported from Canada
        In particular, the Secretary shall by regulation grant
      individuals a waiver to permit individuals to import into the
      United States a prescription drug that - 
          (A) is imported from a licensed pharmacy for personal use by
        an individual, not for resale, in quantities that do not exceed
        a 90-day supply;
          (B) is accompanied by a copy of a valid prescription;
          (C) is imported from Canada, from a seller registered with
        the Secretary;
          (D) is a prescription drug approved by the Secretary under
        subchapter V of this chapter;
          (E) is in the form of a final finished dosage that was
        manufactured in an establishment registered under section 360
        of this title; and
          (F) is imported under such other conditions as the Secretary
        determines to be necessary to ensure public safety.
    (k) Construction
      Nothing in this section limits the authority of the Secretary
    relating to the importation of prescription drugs, other than with
    respect to section 381(d)(1) of this title as provided in this
    section.
    (l) Effectiveness of section
      (1) Commencement of program
        This section shall become effective only if the Secretary
      certifies to the Congress that the implementation of this section
      will - 
          (A) pose no additional risk to the public's health and
        safety; and
          (B) result in a significant reduction in the cost of covered
        products to the American consumer.
      (2) Termination of program
        (A) In general
          If, after the date that is 1 year after the effective date of
        the regulations under subsection (b) of this section and before
        the date that is 18 months after the effective date, the
        Secretary submits to Congress a certification that, in the
        opinion of the Secretary, based on substantial evidence
        obtained after the effective date, the benefits of
        implementation of this section do not outweigh any detriment of
        implementation of this section, this section shall cease to be
        effective as of the date that is 30 days after the date on
        which the Secretary submits the certification.
        (B) Procedure
          The Secretary shall not submit a certification under
        subparagraph (A) unless, after a hearing on the record under
        sections 556 and 557 of title 5, the Secretary - 
            (i)(I) determines that it is more likely than not that
          implementation of this section would result in an increase in
          the risk to the public health and safety;
            (II) identifies specifically, in qualitative and
          quantitative terms, the nature of the increased risk;
            (III) identifies specifically the causes of the increased
          risk; and
            (IV)(aa) considers whether any measures can be taken to
          avoid, reduce, or mitigate the increased risk; and
            (bb) if the Secretary determines that any measures
          described in item (aa) would require additional statutory
          authority, submits to Congress a report describing the
          legislation that would be required;
            (ii) identifies specifically, in qualitative and
          quantitative terms, the benefits that would result from
          implementation of this section (including the benefit of
          reductions in the cost of covered products to consumers in
          the United States, allowing consumers to procure needed
          medication that consumers might not otherwise be able to
          procure without foregoing other necessities of life); and
            (iii)(I) compares in specific terms the detriment
          identified under clause (i) with the benefits identified
          under clause (ii); and
            (II) determines that the benefits do not outweigh the
          detriment.
    (m) Authorization of appropriations
      There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as are
    necessary to carry out this section.

      relevant expertise, to review and evaluate, for the purpose of
      making recommendations to the Secretary on, part or all of any
      application or submission (including a petition, notification,

      shall be subject to the requirements of section 379 of this title
      relating to the confidentiality of information.
      (2) Increased efficiency and expertise through contracts
        The Secretary may use the authority granted in paragraph (1)
      whenever the Secretary determines that use of a contract
      described in paragraph (1) will improve the timeliness of the
      review of an application or submission described in paragraph
      (1), unless using such authority would reduce the quality, or
      unduly increase the cost, of such review. The Secretary may use
      such authority whenever the Secretary determines that use of such
      a contract will improve the quality of the review of an
      application or submission described in paragraph (1), unless
      using such authority would unduly increase the cost of such
      review. Such improvement in timeliness or quality may include
      providing the Secretary increased scientific or technical
      expertise that is necessary to review or evaluate new therapies
      and technologies.
    (b) Review of expert review

        A final decision by the Secretary on any such application or
      submission shall be made within the applicable prescribed time

-HEAD-
    Sec. 451. Congressional statement of findings

-STATUTE-
      Poultry and poultry products are an important source of the
    Nation's total supply of food. They are consumed throughout the
    Nation and the major portion thereof moves in interstate or foreign
    commerce. It is essential in the public interest that the health
    and welfare of consumers be protected by assuring that poultry
    products distributed to them are wholesome, not adulterated, and
    properly marked, labeled, and packaged. Unwholesome, adulterated,
    or misbranded poultry products impair the effective regulation of
    poultry products in interstate or foreign commerce, are injurious
    to the public welfare, destroy markets for wholesome, not
    adulterated, and properly labeled and packaged poultry products,
    and result in sundry losses to poultry producers and processors of
    poultry and poultry products, as well as injury to consumers. It is
    hereby found that all articles and poultry which are regulated
    under this chapter are either in interstate or foreign commerce or
    substantially affect such commerce, and that regulation by the
    Secretary of Agriculture and cooperation by the States and other
    jurisdictions as contemplated by this chapter are appropriate to
    prevent and eliminate burdens upon such commerce, to effectively
    regulate such commerce, and to protect the health and welfare of
    consumers.

    necessary that the health and welfare of consumers be protected by
    assuring that poultry products distributed to them are wholesome,

    provisions that misbranded poultry products impair the effective
    regulation of poultry products and destroy markets for wholesome,

    by the Secretary of Agriculture and cooperation by the states and
    other jurisdictions as contemplated by this chapter are appropriate
    to serve the specified aims, and struck out provisions that all
    poultry and poultry products which have or are required to have
    inspection under this chapter are either in the current of
    interstate or foreign commerce or directly affect such commerce,

    interstate or foreign commerce cannot be effectively inspected and
    regulated without also inspecting and regulating all poultry and
    poultry products in the same establishment, and provisions
    authorizing the Secretary to designate major consuming areas.

      an article which is not otherwise deemed adulterated under clause
      (B), (C), or (D) shall nevertheless be deemed adulterated if use
      of the pesticide chemical, food additive, or color additive in or
      on such article is prohibited by regulations of the Secretary in
      official establishments;
        (3) if it consists in whole or in part of any filthy, putrid,
      or decomposed substance or is for any other reason unsound,
      unhealthful, unwholesome, or otherwise unfit for human food;
        (4) if it has been prepared, packed, or held under insanitary
      conditions whereby it may have become contaminated with filth, or
      whereby it may have been rendered injurious to health;
        (5) if it is, in whole or in part, the product of any poultry
      which has died otherwise than by slaughter;
        (6) if its container is composed, in whole or in part, of any
      poisonous or deleterious substance which may render the contents
      injurious to health;
        (7) if it has been intentionally subjected to radiation, unless
      the use of the radiation was in conformity with a regulation or
      exemption in effect pursuant to section 348 of this title;
        (8) if any valuable constituent has been in whole or in part
      omitted or abstracted therefrom; or if any substance has been
      substituted, wholly or in part therefor; or if damage or
      inferiority has been concealed in any manner; or if any substance
      has been added thereto or mixed or packed therewith so as to
      increase its bulk or weight, or reduce its quality or strength,
      or make it appear better or of greater value than it is.

      (h) The term "misbranded" shall apply to any poultry product
    under one or more of the following circumstances:
        (1) if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular;
        (2) if it is offered for sale under the name of another food;
        (3) if it is an imitation of another food, unless its label
      bears, in type of uniform size and prominence, the word
      "imitation" and immediately thereafter, the name of the food
      imitated;
        (4) if its container is so made, formed, or filled as to be
      misleading;

      an accurate statement of the quantity of the product in terms of
      weight, measure, or numerical count: Provided, That under clause
      (B) of this subparagraph (5), reasonable variations may be
      permitted, and exemptions as to small packages or articles not in
      packages or other containers may be established by regulations
      prescribed by the Secretary;
        (6) if any word, statement, or other information required by or
      under authority of this chapter to appear on the label or other
      labeling is not prominently placed thereon with such
      conspicuousness (as compared with other words, statements,
      designs, or devices, in the labeling) and in such terms as to
      render it likely to be read and understood by the ordinary
      individual under customary conditions of purchase and use;
        (7) if it purports to be or is represented as a food for which
      a definition and standard of identity or composition has been
      prescribed by regulations of the Secretary under section 457 of
      this title unless (A) it conforms to such definition and
      standard, and (B) its label bears the name of the food specified
      in the definition and standard and, insofar as may be required by
      such regulations, the common names of optional ingredients (other
      than spices, flavoring, and coloring) present in such food;
        (8) if it purports to be or is represented as a food for which
      a standard or standards of fill of container have been prescribed
      by regulations of the Secretary under section 457 of this title,
      and it falls below the standard of fill of container applicable
      thereto, unless its label bears, in such manner and form as such
      regulations specify, a statement that it falls below such
      standard;
        (9) if it is not subject to the provisions of subparagraph (7),
      unless its label bears (A) the common or usual name of the food,
      if any there be, and (B) in case it is fabricated from two or
      more ingredients, the common or usual name of each such
      ingredient; except that spices, flavorings, and colorings may,
      when authorized by the Secretary, be designated as spices,
      flavorings, and colorings without naming each: Provided, That to
      the extent that compliance with the requirements of clause (B) of
      this subparagraph (9) is impracticable or results in deception or
      unfair competition, exemptions shall be established by
      regulations promulgated by the Secretary;
        (10) if it purports to be or is represented for special dietary
      uses unless its label bears such information concerning its
      vitamin, mineral, and other dietary properties as the Secretary,
      after consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human
      Services, determines to be, and by regulations prescribes as,
      necessary in order fully to inform purchasers as to its value for
      such uses;
        (11) if it bears or contains any artificial flavoring,
      artificial coloring, or chemical preservative unless it bears
      labeling stating that fact: Provided, That, to the extent that
      compliance with the requirements of this subparagraph (11) is
      impracticable, exemptions shall be established by regulations
      promulgated by the Secretary; or
        (12) if it fails to bear on its containers, and in the case of
      nonconsumer packaged carcasses (if the Secretary so requires)
      directly thereon, as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe,
      the official inspection legend and official establishment number
      of the establishment where the article was processed, and,
      unrestricted by any of the foregoing, such other information as
      the Secretary may require in such regulations to assure that it
      will not have false or misleading labeling and that the public
      will be informed of the manner of handling required to maintain
      the article in a wholesome condition.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 454. Federal and State cooperation in development and
      administration of State poultry product inspection programs

-STATUTE-
    (a) State laws; planning, technical and financial assistance;
      advisory committees
      It is the policy of the Congress to protect the consuming public
    from poultry products that are adulterated or misbranded and to
    assist in efforts by State and other government agencies to
    accomplish this objective. In furtherance of this policy - 
        (1) The Secretary is authorized, whenever he determines that it
      would effectuate the purposes of this chapter, to cooperate with
      the appropriate State agency in developing and administering a
      State poultry product inspection program in any State which has
      enacted a mandatory State poultry product inspection law that
      imposes ante mortem and post mortem inspection, reinspection and
      sanitation requirements that are at least equal to those under
      this chapter, with respect to all or certain classes of persons
      engaged in the State in slaughtering poultry or processing
      poultry products for use as human food solely for distribution
      within such State.
        (2) The Secretary is further authorized, whenever he determines
      that it would effectuate the purposes of this chapter, to
      cooperate with appropriate State agencies in developing and
      administering State programs under State laws containing
      authorities at least equal to those provided in section 460 of
      this title; and to cooperate with other agencies of the United
      States in carrying out any provisions of this chapter. In
      carrying out the provisions of this chapter, the Secretary may
      conduct such examinations, investigations, and inspections as he
      determines practicable through any officer or employee of any
      State or Territory or the District of Columbia commissioned by
      the Secretary for such purpose.
        (3) Cooperation with State agencies under this section may
      include furnishing to the appropriate State agency (i) advisory
      assistance in planning and otherwise developing an adequate State
      program under the State law; and (ii) technical and laboratory
      assistance and training (including necessary curricular and
      instructional materials and equipment), and financial and other
      aid for administration of such a program. The amount to be
      contributed to any State by the Secretary under this section from
      Federal funds for any year shall not exceed 50 per centum of the
      estimated total cost of the cooperative program; and the Federal
      funds shall be allocated among the States desiring to cooperate
      on an equitable basis. Such cooperation and payment shall be
      contingent at all times upon the administration of the State
      program in a manner which the Secretary, in consultation with the
      appropriate advisory committee appointed under subparagraph (4),
      deems adequate to effectuate the purposes of this section.
        (4) The Secretary may appoint advisory committees consisting of
      such representatives of appropriate State agencies as the
      Secretary and the State agencies may designate to consult with
      him concerning State and Federal programs with respect to poultry
      product inspection and other matters within the scope of this
      chapter, including evaluating State programs for purposes of this
      chapter, and obtaining better coordination and more uniformity
      among the State programs and between the Federal and State
      programs and adequate protection of consumers.
    (b) Appropriate State agency; performance of functions by
      subordinate governmental unit
      The appropriate State agency with which the Secretary may
    cooperate under this chapter shall be a single agency in the State
    which is primarily responsible for the coordination of the State
    programs having objectives similar to those under this chapter.
    When the State program includes performance of certain functions by
    a municipality or other subordinate governmental unit, such unit
    shall be deemed to be a part of the State agency for purposes of
    this section.
    (c) Intrastate activities; designation of State for regulation;
      publication of designation; exempted operations; termination of
      designation; review of operations in nondesignated States; annual
      report
      (1) If the Secretary has reason to believe, by thirty days prior
    to the expiration of two years after August 18, 1968, that a State
    has failed to develop or is not enforcing, with respect to all
    establishments within its jurisdiction (except those that would be
    exempted from Federal inspection under subparagraph (2) of this
    paragraph (c)) at which poultry are slaughtered, or poultry
    products are processed for use as human food, solely for
    distribution within such State, and the products of such
    establishments, requirements at least equal to those imposed under
    sections 451 to 453, 455 to 459, 461 to 467d of this title, he
    shall promptly notify the Governor of the State of this fact. If
    the Secretary determines, after consultation with the Governor of
    the State, or representative selected by him, that such
    requirements have not been developed and activated, he shall
    promptly after the expiration of such two-year period designate
    such State as one in which the provisions of said sections of this
    chapter shall apply to operations and transactions wholly within
    such State: Provided, That if the Secretary has reason to believe
    that the State will activate such requirements within one
    additional year, he may delay such designation for said period, and
    not designate the State, if he determines at the end of the year
    that the State then has such requirements in effective operation.
    The Secretary shall publish any such designation in the Federal
    Register and, upon the expiration of thirty days after such
    publication, the provisions of said sections of this chapter shall
    apply to operations and transactions and to persons engaged therein
    in the State to the same extent and in the same manner as if such
    operations and transactions were conducted in or for commerce.
    However, notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if
    the Secretary determines that any establishment within a State is
    producing adulterated poultry products for distribution within such
    State which would clearly endanger the public health he shall
    notify the Governor of the State and the appropriate advisory
    committee provided for by subparagraph (a)(4) of this section of
    such fact for effective action under State or local law. If the
    State does not take action to prevent such endangering of the
    public health within a reasonable time after such notice, as
    determined by the Secretary, in light of the risk to public health,
    the Secretary may forthwith designate any such establishment as
    subject to the provisions of said sections of this chapter, and
    thereupon the establishment and operator thereof shall be subject
    to such provisions as though engaged in commerce until such time as
    the Secretary determines that such State has developed and will
    enforce requirements at least equal to those imposed under said
    sections.
      (2) The provisions of this chapter requiring inspection of the
    slaughter of poultry and the processing of poultry products shall
    not apply to operations of types traditionally and usually
    conducted at retail stores and restaurants, when conducted at any
    retail store or restaurant or similar retail-type establishment for
    sale in normal retail quantities or service of such articles to
    consumers at such establishments if such establishments are subject
    to such inspection provisions only under this paragraph (c). For
    the purposes of this subparagraph, operations conducted at a
    restaurant central kitchen facility shall be considered as being
    conducted at a restaurant if the restaurant central kitchen
    prepares poultry products that are ready to eat when they leave
    such facility and are served in meals or as entrees only to
    customers at restaurants owned or operated by the same person
    owning or operating such facility: Provided, That such facility
    shall be subject to the provisions of section 460(b) of this title:
    Provided further, That the facility may be subject to the
    inspection requirements of this chapter for as long as the
    Secretary deems necessary, if the Secretary determines that the
    sanitary conditions or practices of the facility or the processing
    procedures or methods at the facility are such that any of its
    poultry products are rendered adulterated.
      (3) Whenever the Secretary determines that any State designated
    under this paragraph (c) has developed and will enforce State
    poultry products inspection requirements at least equal to those
    imposed under the aforesaid sections of this chapter, with respect
    to the operations and transactions within such State which are
    regulated under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (c), he shall
    terminate the designation of such State under this paragraph (c),
    but this shall not preclude the subsequent redesignation of the
    State at any time upon thirty days' notice to the Governor and
    publication in the Federal Register in accordance with this
    paragraph, and any State may be designated upon such notice and
    publication, at any time after the period specified in this
    paragraph whether or not the State has theretofore been designated,
    upon the Secretary determining that it is not effectively enforcing
    requirements at least equal to those imposed under said sections.
      (4) The Secretary shall promptly upon August 18, 1968, and
    periodically thereafter, but at least annually, review the
    requirements, including the enforcement thereof, of the several
    States not designated under this paragraph (c), with respect to the
    slaughter, and the processing, storage, handling, and distribution
    of poultry products, and inspection of such operations, and
    annually report thereon to the Committee on Agriculture of the
    House of Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture,
    Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate in the report required in
    section 470 (!1) of this title.

    (d) "State" defined
      As used in this section, the term "State" means any State
    (including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico) or organized territory.

    (a) Ante mortem inspection
      For the purpose of preventing the entry into or flow or movement
    in commerce of, or the burdening of commerce by, any poultry
    product which is capable of use as human food and is adulterated,
    the Secretary shall, where and to the extent considered by him
    necessary, cause to be made by inspectors ante mortem inspection of
    poultry in each official establishment processing poultry or
    poultry products for commerce or otherwise subject to inspection
    under this chapter.
    (b) Post mortem inspection; quarantine, segregation, and
      reinspection
      The Secretary, whenever processing operations are being
    conducted, shall cause to be made by inspectors post mortem
    inspection of the carcass of each bird processed, and at any time
    such quarantine, segregation, and reinspection as he deems
    necessary of poultry and poultry products capable of use as human
    food in each official establishment processing such poultry or
    poultry products for commerce or otherwise subject to inspection
    under this chapter.
    (c) Condemnation; appeal; reprocessing
      All poultry carcasses and parts thereof and other poultry
    products found to be adulterated shall be condemned and shall, if
    no appeal be taken from such determination of condemnation, be
    destroyed for human food purposes under the supervision of an
    inspector: Provided, That carcasses, parts, and products, which may
    by reprocessing be made not adulterated, need not be so condemned
    and destroyed if so reprocessed under the supervision of an
    inspector and thereafter found to be not adulterated. If an appeal
    be taken from such determination, the carcasses, parts, or products
    shall be appropriately marked and segregated pending completion of
    an appeal inspection, which appeal shall be at the cost of the
    appellant if the Secretary determines that the appeal is frivolous.
    If the determination of condemnation is sustained the carcasses,
    parts, and products shall be destroyed for human food purposes
    under the supervision of an inspector.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 457. Labeling and container standards

-STATUTE-
    (a) Requirements for shipping containers and immediate containers;
      nonconsumer packaged carcasses
      All poultry products inspected at any official establishment
    under the authority of this chapter and found to be not
    adulterated, shall at the time they leave the establishment bear,
    in distinctly legible form, on their shipping containers and
    immediate containers as the Secretary may require, the information
    required under paragraph (h) of section 453 of this title. In
    addition, the Secretary whenever he determines such action is
    practicable and necessary for the protection of the public, may
    require nonconsumer packaged carcasses at the time they leave the
    establishment to bear directly thereon in distinctly legible form
    any information required under such paragraph (h).
    (b) Labeling requirements; definitions and standards of identity or
      composition or articles and standards of fill of container;
      standards consistent with Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act;
      consistency between Federal and State standards
      The Secretary, whenever he determines such action is necessary
    for the protection of the public, may prescribe: (1) the styles and
    sizes of type to be used with respect to material required to be
    incorporated in labeling to avoid false or misleading labeling in
    marketing and labeling any articles or poultry subject to this
    chapter; (2) definitions and standards of identity or composition
    or articles subject to this chapter and standards of fill of
    container for such articles not inconsistent with any such
    standards established under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
    Act [21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.], and there shall be consultation
    between the Secretary and the Secretary of Health and Human
    Services prior to the issuance of such standards under either Act
    relating to articles subject to this chapter to avoid inconsistency
    in such standards and possible impairment of the coordinated
    effective administration of this chapter and the Federal Food,
    Drug, and Cosmetic Act. There shall also be consultation between
    the Secretary and an appropriate advisory committee provided for in
    section 454 of this title, prior to the issuance of such standards
    under this chapter, to avoid, insofar as feasible, inconsistency
    between Federal and State standards.
    (c) Use of trade names; false or misleading marking or labeling;
      misleading form or size of container
      No article subject to this chapter shall be sold or offered for
    sale by any person in commerce, under any name or other marking or
    labeling which is false or misleading, or in any container of a
    misleading form or size, but established trade names and other
    marking and labeling and containers which are not false or
    misleading and which are approved by the Secretary are permitted.
    (d) Withholding use of false or misleading mark, label, or
      container size or form; modification; hearing; conclusiveness of
      determination; appeal
      If the Secretary has reason to believe that any marking or
    labeling or the size or form of any container in use or proposed
    for use with respect to any article subject to this chapter is
    false or misleading in any particular, he may direct that such use
    be withheld unless the marking, labeling, or container is modified
    in such manner as he may prescribe so that it will not be false or
    misleading. If the person using or proposing to use the marketing,
    labeling, or container does not accept the determination of the
    Secretary, such person may request a hearing, but the use of the
    marking, labeling, or container shall, if the Secretary so directs,
    be withheld pending hearing and final determination by the
    Secretary. Any such determination by the Secretary shall be
    conclusive unless, within thirty days after receipt of notice of
    such final determination, the person adversely affected thereby
    appeals to the United States Court of Appeals for the circuit in
    which such person has its principal place of business or to the
    United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
    Circuit. The provisions of section 194 of title 7 shall be
    applicable to appeals taken under this section.

    a public warehouseman storing any such articles in or for commerce,
    or engage in the business of buying, selling, or transporting in
    commerce, or importing, any dead, dying, disabled, or diseased
    poultry, or parts of the carcasses of any poultry that died
    otherwise than by slaughter, unless when required by regulations of
    the Secretary, he has registered with the Secretary his name, and
    the address of each place of business at which, and all trade names
    under which, he conducts such business.
    (d) Regulation of transactions, transportation, or importation of
      dead, dying, disabled or diseased poultry or carcasses to prevent

      No person engaged in the business of buying, selling, or
    transporting in commerce, or importing, dead, dying, disabled, or
    diseased poultry, or any parts of the carcasses of any poultry that
    died otherwise than by slaughter, shall buy, sell, transport, offer
    for sale or transportation, or receive for transportation, in
    commerce, or import, any dead, dying, disabled, or diseased poultry
    or parts of the carcasses of any poultry that died otherwise than
    by slaughter, unless such transaction, transportation or
    importation is made in accordance with such regulations as the
    Secretary may prescribe to assure that such poultry, or the
    unwholesome parts or products thereof, will be prevented from being
    used for human food.
    (e) Federal provisions applicable to State or Territorial business
      transactions of a local nature and not subject to local authority
      The authority conferred on the Secretary by paragraph (b), (c),

    specified kinds of business in or for commerce may be exercised
    with respect to persons engaged, in any State or organized
    territory, in such kinds of business but not in or for commerce,
    whenever the Secretary determines, after consultation with an
    appropriate advisory committee provided for in section 454 of this
    title, that the State or territory does not have at least equal
    authority under its laws or such authority is not exercised in a
    manner to effectuate the purposes of this chapter, including the
    State or territory providing for the Secretary or his
    representative being afforded access to such places of business and
    the facilities, inventories, and records thereof, and the taking of
    reasonable samples, where he determines necessary in carrying out
    his responsibilities under this chapter; and in such case the
    provisions of paragraph (b), (c), or (d) of this section,
    respectively, shall apply to such persons to the same extent and in
    the same manner as if they were engaged in such business in or for
    commerce and the transactions involved were in commerce.

    Sec. 464. Exemptions

-STATUTE-
    (a) Persons exempted
      The Secretary shall, by regulation and under such conditions as
    to sanitary standards, practices, and procedures as he may
    prescribe, exempt from specific provisions of this chapter - 
        (1) retail dealers with respect to poultry products sold
      directly to consumers in individual retail stores, if the only
      processing operation performed by such retail dealers is the
      cutting up of poultry products on the premises where such sales
      to consumers are made;
        (2) for such period of time as the Secretary determines that it
      would be impracticable to provide inspection and the exemption
      will aid in the effective administration of this chapter, any
      person engaged in the processing of poultry or poultry products
      for commerce and the poultry or poultry products processed by
      such person: Provided, however, That no such exemption shall
      continue in effect on and after January 1, 1970; and
        (3) persons slaughtering, processing, or otherwise handling
      poultry or poultry products which have been or are to be
      processed as required by recognized religious dietary laws, to
      the extent that the Secretary determines necessary to avoid
      conflict with such requirements while still effectuating the
      purposes of this chapter.
    (b) Territorial exemption
      The Secretary may, under such sanitary conditions as he may by
    regulations prescribe, exempt from the inspection requirements of
    this chapter the slaughter of poultry, and the processing of
    poultry products, by any person in any Territory not organized with
    a legislative body, solely for distribution within such Territory,
    when the Secretary determines that it is impracticable to provide
    such inspection within the limits of funds appropriated for
    administration of this chapter and that such exemption will aid in
    the effective administration of this chapter.
    (c) Personal slaughtering; custom slaughtering; name and address of
      the poultry producer or processor in lieu of other labeling
      requirements; small enterprises; slaughterers or processors of
      specified number of turkeys; poultry producers raising poultry on
      own farms
      (1) The Secretary shall, by regulation and under such conditions,
    including sanitary standards, practices, and procedures, as he may
    prescribe, exempt from specific provisions of this chapter - 
        (A) the slaughtering by any person of poultry of his own
      raising, and the processing by him and transportation in commerce
      of the poultry products exclusively for use by him and members of
      his household and his nonpaying guests and employees;
        (B) the custom slaughter by any person of poultry delivered by
      the owner thereof for such slaughter, and the processing by such
      slaughterer and transportation in commerce of the poultry
      products exclusively for use, in the household of such owner, by
      him and members of his household and his nonpaying guests and
      employees: Provided, That such custom slaughterer does not engage
      in the business of buying or selling any poultry products capable
      of use as human food;
        (C) the slaughtering and processing of poultry products in any
      State or Territory or the District of Columbia by any poultry
      producer on his own premises with respect to sound and healthy
      poultry raised on his premises and the distribution by any person
      solely within such jurisdiction of the poultry products derived
      from such operations, if, in lieu of other labeling requirements,
      such poultry products are identified with the name and address of
      such poultry producer, and if they are not otherwise misbranded,
      and are sound, clean, and fit for human food when so distributed;
      and
        (D) the slaughtering of sound and healthy poultry or the
      processing of poultry products of such poultry in any State or
      territory or the District of Columbia by any poultry producer or
      other person for distribution by him solely within such
      jurisdiction directly to household consumers, restaurants,
      hotels, and boarding houses, for use in their own dining rooms,
      or in the preparation of meals for sales direct to consumers, if,
      in lieu of other labeling requirements, such poultry products are
      identified with the name and address of the processor, and if
      they are not otherwise misbranded and are sound, clean, and fit
      for human food when distributed by such processor.

    The exemptions provided for in clauses (C) and (D) above shall not
    apply if the poultry producer or other person engages in the
    current calendar year in the business of buying or selling any
    poultry or poultry products other than as specified in such
    clauses.
      (2) In addition to the specific exemptions provided herein, the
    Secretary shall, when he determines that the protection of
    consumers from adulterated or misbranded poultry products will not
    be impaired by such action, provide by regulation, consistent with
    subparagraph (3), for the exemption of the operation and products
    of small enterprises (including poultry producers), not exempted
    under subparagraph (1), which are engaged in any State or Territory
    or the District of Columbia in slaughtering and/or cutting up
    poultry for distribution as carcasses or parts thereof solely for
    distribution within such jurisdiction, from such provisions of this
    chapter as he deems appropriate, while still protecting the public
    from adulterated or misbranded products, under such conditions,
    including sanitary requirements, as he shall prescribe to
    effectuate the purposes of this chapter.
      (3) No exemption under subparagraph (1)(C) or (D) or subparagraph
    (2) shall apply to any poultry producer or other person who, in the
    current calendar year - 
        (A) slaughters or processes the products of more than 20,000
      poultry; or
        (B) slaughters or processes the products of poultry at a
      facility used for slaughtering or processing of the products of
      poultry by any other poultry producer or person.

    Notwithstanding clause (B), the Secretary may grant such exemption
    to any poultry producer or other person if the Secretary
    determines, upon application of such poultry producer or other
    person, that granting such exemption will not impair effectuating
    the purposes of this chapter.
      (4) The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to poultry
    producers with respect to poultry of their own raising on their own
    farms if (i) such producers slaughter not more than 1,000 poultry
    during the calendar year for which this exemption is being
    determined; (ii) such poultry producers do not engage in buying or
    selling poultry products other than those produced from poultry
    raised on their own farms; and (iii) none of such poultry moves in
    commerce (as defined in section 453(a) of this title).
    (d) Pizzas containing poultry products
      (1) Under such terms and conditions as the Secretary shall
    prescribe through rules and regulations issued under this section
    that may be necessary to ensure food safety and protect public
    health such as special handling procedures, the Secretary shall
    exempt pizzas containing a poultry product from the inspection
    requirements of this chapter if - 
        (A) the poultry product components of the pizzas have been
      prepared, inspected, and passed in a cured or cooked form as
      ready-to-eat in compliance with the requirements of this chapter;
      and
        (B) the pizzas are to be served in public or private nonprofit
      institutions.

      (2) The Secretary may withdraw or modify any exemption under this
    subsection whenever the Secretary determines such action is
    necessary to ensure food safety and to protect public health. The
    Secretary may reinstate or further modify any exemption withdrawn
    or modified under this subsection.
    (e) Applicability of adulteration and misbranding provisions to
      articles exempted from inspection
      The adulteration and misbranding provisions of this chapter,
    other than the requirement of the inspection legend, shall apply to
    articles which are exempted from inspection under this section,
    except as otherwise specified under paragraphs (a) and (d).
    (f) Suspension or termination of exemption
      The Secretary may by order suspend or terminate any exemption
    under this section with respect to any person whenever he finds
    that such action will aid in effectuating the purposes of this
    chapter.

    wholesome, fit for human food, not adulterated, and contain no dye,
    chemical, preservative, or ingredient which renders them
    unhealthful, unwholesome, adulterated, or unfit for human food and
    unless they also comply with the rules and regulations made by the
    Secretary of Agriculture to assure that imported poultry or poultry
    products comply with the standards provided for in this chapter.
    All imported, slaughtered poultry, or parts or products thereof,
    shall after entry into the United States in compliance with such
    rules and regulations be deemed and treated as domestic slaughtered

    rules and regulations the Secretary of Agriculture may prescribe
    the terms and conditions for the destruction of all slaughtered
    poultry, or parts or products thereof, offered for entry and

    for importation into the United States shall - 
        (A) be subject to inspection, sanitary, quality, species
      verification, and residue standards that achieve a level of
      sanitary protection equivalent to that achieved under United
      States standards; and
        (B) have been processed in facilities and under conditions that

      achieved under United States standards.

      (2)(A) The Secretary may treat as equivalent to a United States
    standard a standard of an exporting country described in paragraph
    (1) if the exporting country provides the Secretary with scientific
    evidence or other information, in accordance with risk assessment
    methodologies determined appropriate by the Secretary, to
    demonstrate that the standard of the exporting country achieves the
    level of sanitary protection achieved under the United States

        (ii) provide the basis for the determination in writing to the
      exporting country on request.

      (3) Any such imported poultry article that does not meet such
    standards shall not be permitted entry into the United States.
      (4) The Secretary shall enforce this subsection through -

    necessary to effectuate the purposes of this chapter) refuse to
    provide, or withdraw, inspection service under this chapter with
    respect to any establishment if he determines, after opportunity
    for a hearing is accorded to the applicant for, or recipient of,

    applicant or recipient or anyone responsibly connected with the
    applicant or recipient, has been convicted, in any Federal or State
    court, within the previous ten years of (1) any felony or more than
    one misdemeanor under any law based upon the acquiring, handling,

    such action; but such withdrawal or refusal shall continue in
    effect unless otherwise ordered by the Secretary.
    (c) Finality and conclusiveness of determination; judicial review;
      record
      The determination and order of the Secretary when made after
    opportunity for hearing, with respect to withdrawal or refusal of
    inspection service under this chapter shall be final and conclusive
    unless the affected applicant for, or recipient of, inspection
    service files application for judicial review within thirty days
    after the effective date of such order in the United States Court
    of Appeals as provided in section 457 of this title. Judicial

      such substance in or on such article does not ordinarily render
      it injurious to health;
        (2)(A) if it bears or contains (by reason of administration of
      any substance to the live animal or otherwise) any added
      poisonous or added deleterious substance (other than one which is
      (i) a pesticide chemical in or on a raw agricultural commodity;
      (ii) a food additive; or (iii) a color additive) which may, in

      and such commodity bears or contains a pesticide chemical which
      is unsafe within the meaning of section 346a of this title,

      is prohibited by regulations of the Secretary in establishments
      at which inspection is maintained under this subchapter;
        (3) if it consists in whole or in part of any filthy, putrid,
      or decomposed substance or is for any other reason unsound,
      unhealthful, unwholesome, or otherwise unfit for human food;
        (4) if it has been prepared, packed, or held under insanitary
      conditions whereby it may have become contaminated with filth, or
      whereby it may have been rendered injurious to health;
        (5) if it is, in whole or in part, the product of an animal
      which has died otherwise than by slaughter;
        (6) if its container is composed, in whole or in part, of any
      poisonous or deleterious substance which may render the contents
      injurious to health;
        (7) if it has been intentionally subjected to radiation, unless
      the use of the radiation was in conformity with a regulation or
      exemption in effect pursuant to section 348 of this title;
        (8) if any valuable constituent has been in whole or in part
      omitted or abstracted therefrom; or if any substance has been
      substituted, wholly or in part therefor; or if damage or
      inferiority has been concealed in any manner; or if any substance
      has been added thereto or mixed or packed therewith so as to
      increase its bulk or weight, or reduce its quality or strength,
      or make it appear better or of greater value than it is; or
        (9) if it is margarine containing animal fat and any of the raw
      material used therein consisted in whole or in part of any
      filthy, putrid, or decomposed substance.

      (n) The term "misbranded" shall apply to any carcass, part
    thereof, meat or meat food product under one or more of the
    following circumstances:
        (1) if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular;
        (2) if it is offered for sale under the name of another food;
        (3) if it is an imitation of another food, unless its label
      bears, in type of uniform size and prominence, the word
      "imitation" and immediately thereafter, the name of the food
      imitated;
        (4) if its container is so made, formed, or filled as to be
      misleading;

      packer, or distributor; and (B) an accurate statement of the
      quantity of the contents in terms of weight, measure, or
      numerical count: Provided, That under clause (B) of this
      subparagraph (5), reasonable variations may be permitted, and
      exemptions as to small packages may be established, by
      regulations prescribed by the Secretary;
        (6) if any word, statement, or other information required by or
      under authority of this chapter to appear on the label or other
      labeling is not prominently placed thereon with such
      conspicuousness (as compared with other words, statements,
      designs, or devices, in the labeling) and in such terms as to
      render it likely to be read and understood by the ordinary
      individual under customary conditions of purchase and use;
        (7) if it purports to be or is represented as a food for which
      a definition and standard of identity or composition has been
      prescribed by regulations of the Secretary under section 607 of
      this title unless (A) it conforms to such definition and
      standard, and (B) its label bears the name of the food specified
      in the definition and standard and, insofar as may be required by
      such regulations, the common names of optional ingredients (other
      than spices, flavoring, and coloring) present in such food;
        (8) if it purports to be or is represented as a food for which
      a standard or standards of fill of container have been prescribed
      by regulations of the Secretary under section 607 of this title,
      and it falls below the standard of fill of container applicable
      thereto, unless its label bears, in such manner and form as such
      regulations specify, a statement that it falls below such
      standard;
        (9) if it is not subject to the provisions of subparagraph (7),
      unless its label bears (A) the common or usual name of the food,

      more ingredients, the common or usual name of each such
      ingredient; except that spices, flavorings, and colorings may,

      flavorings, and colorings without naming each: Provided, That to
      the extent that compliance with the requirements of clause (B) of
      this subparagraph (9) is impracticable, or results in deception
      or unfair competition, exemptions shall be established by
      regulations promulgated by the Secretary;
        (10) if it purports to be or is represented for special dietary
      uses, unless its label bears such information concerning its
      vitamin, mineral, and other dietary properties as the Secretary,
      after consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human
      Services, determines to be, and by regulations prescribes as,
      necessary in order fully to inform purchasers as to its value for
      such uses;
        (11) if it bears or contains any artificial flavoring,
      artificial coloring, or chemical preservative, unless it bears
      labeling stating that fact: Provided, That, to the extent that
      compliance with the requirements of this subparagraph (11) is
      impracticable, exemptions shall be established by regulations
      promulgated by the Secretary; or
        (12) if it fails to bear, directly thereon or on its container,
      as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe, the inspection
      legend and, unrestricted by any of the foregoing, such other
      information as the Secretary may require in such regulations to
      assure that it will not have false or misleading labeling and

      required to maintain the article in a wholesome condition.

-STATUTE-
      Meat and meat food products are an important source of the
    Nation's total supply of food. They are consumed throughout the
    Nation and the major portion thereof moves in interstate or foreign
    commerce. It is essential in the public interest that the health
    and welfare of consumers be protected by assuring that meat and
    meat food products distributed to them are wholesome, not
    adulterated, and properly marked, labeled, and packaged.
    Unwholesome, adulterated, or misbranded meat or meat food products
    impair the effective regulation of meat and meat food products in
    interstate or foreign commerce, are injurious to the public
    welfare, destroy markets for wholesome, not adulterated, and
    properly labeled and packaged meat and meat food products, and
    result in sundry losses to livestock producers and processors of
    meat and meat food products, as well as injury to consumers. The
    unwholesome, adulterated, mislabeled, or deceptively packaged
    articles can be sold at lower prices and compete unfairly with the
    wholesome, not adulterated, and properly labeled and packaged
    articles, to the detriment of consumers and the public generally.
    It is hereby found that all articles and animals which are
    regulated under this chapter are either in interstate or foreign
    commerce or substantially affect such commerce, and that regulation
    by the Secretary and cooperation by the States and other
    jurisdictions as contemplated by this chapter are appropriate to
    prevent and eliminate burdens upon such commerce, to effectively
    regulate such commerce, and to protect the health and welfare of
    consumers.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Examination of animals before slaughtering; diseased animals
      slaughtered separately and carcasses examined
      For the purpose of preventing the use in commerce of meat and
    meat food products which are adulterated, the Secretary shall cause
    to be made, by inspectors appointed for that purpose, an
    examination and inspection of all amenable species before they
    shall be allowed to enter into any slaughtering, packing, meat-
    canning, rendering, or similar establishment, in which they are to
    be slaughtered and the meat and meat food products thereof are to
    be used in commerce; and all amenable species found on such
    inspection to show symptoms of disease shall be set apart and
    slaughtered separately from all other cattle, sheep, swine, goats,
    horses, mules, or other equines, and when so slaughtered the
    carcasses of said cattle, sheep, swine, goats, horses, mules, or
    other equines shall be subject to a careful examination and
    inspection, all as provided by the rules and regulations to be
    prescribed by the Secretary, as provided for in this subchapter.
    (b) Humane methods of slaughter
      For the purpose of preventing the inhumane slaughtering of
    livestock, the Secretary shall cause to be made, by inspectors
    appointed for that purpose, an examination and inspection of the
    method by which amenable species are slaughtered and handled in
    connection with slaughter in the slaughtering establishments
    inspected under this chapter. The Secretary may refuse to provide
    inspection to a new slaughtering establishment or may cause
    inspection to be temporarily suspended at a slaughtering
    establishment if the Secretary finds that any cattle, sheep, swine,
    goats, horses, mules, or other equines have been slaughtered or
    handled in connection with slaughter at such establishment by any
    method not in accordance with the Act of August 27, 1958 (72 Stat.
    862; 7 U.S.C. 1901-1906) until the establishment furnishes
    assurances satisfactory to the Secretary that all slaughtering and
    handling in connection with slaughter of livestock shall be in
    accordance with such a method.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Labeling receptacles or coverings of meat or meat food products
      inspected and passed; supervision by inspectors
      When any meat or meat food product prepared for commerce which
    has been inspected as hereinbefore provided and marked "Inspected
    and passed" shall be placed or packed in any can, pot, tin, canvas,
    or other receptacle or covering in any establishment where
    inspection under the provisions of this chapter is maintained, the
    person, firm, or corporation preparing said product shall cause a
    label to be attached to said can, pot, tin, canvas, or other
    receptacle or covering, under the supervision of an inspector,
    which label shall state that the contents thereof have been
    "inspected and passed" under the provisions of this chapter; and no
    inspection and examination of meat or meat food products deposited
    or inclosed in cans, tins, pots, canvas, or other receptacle or
    covering in any establishment where inspection under the provisions
    of this chapter is maintained shall be deemed to be complete until
    such meat or meat food products have been sealed or inclosed in
    said can, tin, pot, canvas, or other receptacle or covering under
    the supervision of an inspector.
    (b) Information on articles or containers; legible form
      All carcasses, parts of carcasses, meat and meat food products
    inspected at any establishment under the authority of this
    subchapter and found to be not adulterated, shall at the time they
    leave the establishment bear, in distinctly legible form, directly
    thereon or on their containers, as the Secretary may require, the
    information required under paragraph (n) of section 601 of this
    title.
    (c) Labeling: type styles and sizes; definitions and standards of
      identity or composition; standards of fill of container;
      consistency of Federal and Federal-State standards
      The Secretary, whenever he determines such action is necessary
    for the protection of the public, may prescribe: (1) the styles and
    sizes of type to be used with respect to material required to be
    incorporated in labeling to avoid false or misleading labeling in
    marketing and labeling any articles or animals subject to this
    subchapter or subchapter II of this chapter; (2) definitions and
    standards of identity or composition for articles subject to this
    subchapter and standards of fill of container for such articles not
    inconsistent with any such standards established under the Federal
    Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.], and there
    shall be consultation between the Secretary and the Secretary of
    Health and Human Services prior to the issuance of such standards
    under either Act relating to articles subject to this chapter to
    avoid inconsistency in such standards and possible impairment of
    the coordinated effective administration of these Acts. There shall
    also be consultation between the Secretary and an appropriate
    advisory committee provided for in section 661 of this title, prior
    to the issuance of such standards under this chapter, to avoid,
    insofar as feasible, inconsistency between Federal and State
    standards.
    (d) Sales under false or misleading name, other marking or labeling
      or in containers of misleading form or size; trade names, and
      other marking, labeling, and containers approved by Secretary
      No article subject to this subchapter shall be sold or offered
    for sale by any person, firm, or corporation, in commerce, under
    any name or other marking or labeling which is false or misleading,
    or in any container of a misleading form or size, but established
    trade names and other marking and labeling and containers which are
    not false or misleading and which are approved by the Secretary are
    permitted.
    (e) Use withholding directive respecting false or misleading
      marking, labeling, or container; modification of false or
      misleading matter; hearing; withholding use pending proceedings;
      finality of Secretary's action; judicial review; application of
      section 194 of title 7
      If the Secretary has reason to believe that any marking or
    labeling or the size or form of any container in use or proposed
    for use with respect to any article subject to this subchapter is
    false or misleading in any particular, he may direct that such use
    be withheld unless the marking, labeling, or container is modified
    in such manner as he may prescribe so that it will not be false or
    misleading. If the person, firm, or corporation using or proposing
    to use the marking, labeling or container does not accept the
    determination of the Secretary, such person, firm, or corporation
    may request a hearing, but the use of the marking, labeling, or
    container shall, if the Secretary so directs, be withheld pending
    hearing and final determination by the Secretary. Any such
    determination by the Secretary shall be conclusive unless, within
    thirty days after receipt of notice of such final determination,
    the person, firm, or corporation adversely affected thereby appeals
    to the United States court of appeals for the circuit in which such
    person, firm, or corporation has its principal place of business or
    to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
    Circuit. The provisions of section 194 of title 7 shall be
    applicable to appeals taken under this section.
    (f) Lamb and mutton
      The Secretary, consistent with United States international
    obligations, shall establish standards for the labeling of sheep
    carcasses, parts of sheep carcasses, sheepmeat, and sheepmeat food
    products.

    Sec. 620. Imports

-STATUTE-
    (a) Adulteration or misbranding prohibition; compliance with
      inspection, building construction standards, and other
      provisions; humane methods of slaughter; treatment as domestic
      articles subject to this chapter and food, drug, and cosmetic
      provisions; marking and labeling; personal consumption exemption
      No carcasses, parts of carcasses, meat or meat food products of
    cattle, sheep, swine, goats, horses, mules, or other equines which
    are capable of use as human food, shall be imported into the United
    States if such articles are adulterated or misbranded and unless
    they comply with all the inspection, building, construction
    standards, and all other provisions of this chapter and regulations
    issued thereunder applicable to such articles in commerce within
    the United States. No such carcasses, parts of carcasses, meat or
    meat food products shall be imported into the United States unless
    the livestock from which they were produced was slaughtered and
    handled in connection with slaughter in accordance with the Act of
    August 27, 1958 (72 Stat. 862; 7 U.S.C. 1901-1906). All such
    imported articles shall, upon entry into the United States, be
    deemed and treated as domestic articles subject to the other
    provisions of this chapter and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
    Act [21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.]: Provided, That they shall be marked
    and labeled as required by such regulations for imported articles:
    Provided further, That nothing in this section shall apply to any
    individual who purchases meat or meat products outside the United
    States for his own consumption except that the total amount of such
    meat or meat products shall not exceed fifty pounds.
    (b) Terms and conditions for destruction
      The Secretary may prescribe the terms and conditions for the
    destruction of all such articles which are imported contrary to
    this section, unless (1) they are exported by the consignee within
    the time fixed therefor by the Secretary, or (2) in the case of
    articles which are not in compliance with the chapter solely
    because of misbranding, such articles are brought into compliance
    with the chapter under supervision of authorized representatives of
    the Secretary.
    (c) Payment of storage, cartage, and labor charges by owner or
      consignee; liens
      All charges for storage, cartage, and labor with respect to any
    article which is imported contrary to this section shall be paid by
    the owner or consignee, and in default of such payment shall
    constitute a lien against such article and any other article
    thereafter imported under this chapter by or for such owner or
    consignee.
    (d) Prohibition
      The knowing importation of any article contrary to this section
    is prohibited.
    (e) Omitted
    (f) Inspection and other standards; applicability, enforcement,
      etc.; certifications
      Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all carcasses, parts
    of carcasses, meat, and meat food products of cattle, sheep, swine,
    goats, horses, mules, or other equines, capable of use as human
    food, offered for importation into the United States shall be
    subject to the inspection, sanitary, quality, species verification,
    and residue standards applied to products produced in the United
    States. Any such imported meat articles that do not meet such
    standards shall not be permitted entry in to the United States. The
    Secretary shall enforce this provision through (1) the imposition
    of random inspections for such species verification and for
    residues, and (2) random sampling and testing of internal organs
    and fat of the carcasses for residues at the point of slaughter by
    the exporting country in accordance with methods approved by the
    Secretary. Each foreign country from which such meat articles are
    offered for importation into the United States shall obtain a
    certification issued by the Secretary stating that the country
    maintains a program using reliable analytical methods to ensure
    compliance with the United States standards for residues in such
    meat articles. No such meat article shall be permitted entry into
    the United States from a country for which the Secretary has not
    issued such certification. The Secretary shall periodically review
    such certifications and shall revoke any certification if the
    Secretary determines that the country involved is not maintaining a
    program that uses reliable analytical methods to ensure compliance
    with United States standards for residues in such meat articles.
    The consideration of any application for a certification under this
    subsection and the review of any such certification, by the
    Secretary, shall include the inspection of individual
    establishments to ensure that the inspection program of the foreign
    country involved is meeting such United States standards.
    (g) Administration of animal drugs or antibiotics; terms and
      conditions; entry order violations
      The Secretary may prescribe terms and conditions under which
    amenable species that have been administered an animal drug or
    antibiotic banned for use in the United States may be imported for
    slaughter and human consumption. No person shall enter amenable
    species into the United States in violation of any order issued
    under this subsection by the Secretary.
    (h) Reciprocal meat inspection requirement
      (1) As used in this subsection:
        (A) The term "meat articles" means carcasses, meat and meat
      food products of cattle, sheep, swine, goats, horses, mules, or
      other equines, that are capable of use as human food.
        (B) The term "standards" means inspection, building
      construction, sanitary, quality, species verification, residue,
      and other standards that are applicable to meat articles.

      (2) On request of the Committee on Agriculture or the Committee
    on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives or the Committee
    on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry or the Committee on Finance
    of the Senate, or at the initiative of the Secretary, the Secretary
    shall, as soon as practicable, determine whether a particular
    foreign country applies standards for the importation of meat
    articles from the United States that are not related to public
    health concerns about end-product quality that can be substantiated
    by reliable analytical methods.
      (3) If the Secretary determines that a foreign country applies
    standards described in paragraph (2) - 
        (A) the Secretary shall consult with the United States Trade
      Representative; and
        (B) within 30 days after the determination of the Secretary
      under paragraph (2), the Secretary and the United States Trade
      Representative shall recommend to the President whether action
      should be taken under paragraph (4).

      (4) Within 30 days after receiving a recommendation for action
    under paragraph (3), the President shall, if and for such time as
    the President considers appropriate, prohibit imports into the
    United States of any meat articles produced in such foreign country
    unless it is determined that the meat articles produced in that
    country meet the standards applicable to meat articles in commerce
    within the United States.
      (5) The action authorized under paragraph (4) may be used instead
    of, or in addition to, any other action taken under any other law.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Personal slaughtering and custom slaughtering for personal,
      household, guest, and employee uses
      The provisions of this subchapter requiring inspection of the
    slaughter of animals and the preparation of the carcasses, parts
    thereof, meat and meat food products at establishments conducting
    such operations for commerce shall not apply to the slaughtering by
    any person of animals of his own raising, and the preparation by
    him and transportation in commerce of the carcasses, parts thereof,
    meat and meat food products of such animals exclusively for use by
    him and members of his household and his nonpaying guests and
    employees; nor to the custom slaughter by any person, firm, or
    corporation of cattle, sheep, swine or goats delivered by the owner
    thereof for such slaughter, and the preparation by such slaughterer
    and transportation in commerce of the carcasses, parts thereof,
    meat and meat food products of such animals, exclusively for use,
    in the household of such owner, by him and members of his household
    and his nonpaying guests and employees; nor to the custom
    preparation by any person, firm, or corporation of carcasses, parts
    thereof, meat or meat food products, derived from the slaughter by
    any person of cattle, sheep, swine, or goats of his own raising, or
    from game animals, delivered by the owner thereof for such custom
    preparation, and transportation in commerce of such custom prepared
    articles, exclusively for use in the household of such owner, by
    him and members of his household and his nonpaying guests and
    employees: Provided, That in cases where such person, firm, or
    corporation engages in such custom operations at an establishment
    at which inspection under this subchapter is maintained, the
    Secretary may exempt from such inspection at such establishment any
    animals slaughtered or any meat or meat food products otherwise
    prepared on such custom basis: Provided further, That custom
    operations at any establishment shall be exempt from inspection
    requirements as provided by this section only if the establishment
    complies with regulations which the Secretary is hereby authorized
    to promulgate to assure that any carcasses, parts thereof, meat or
    meat food products wherever handled on a custom basis, or any
    containers or packages containing such articles, are separated at
    all times from carcasses, parts thereof, meat or meat food products
    prepared for sale, and that all such articles prepared on a custom
    basis, or any containers or packages containing such articles, are
    plainly marked "Not for Sale" immediately after being prepared and
    kept so identified until delivered to the owner and that the
    establishment conducting the custom operation is maintained and
    operated in a sanitary manner.
    (b) Territorial exemption; refusal, withdrawal, or modification
      The Secretary may, under such sanitary conditions as he may by
    regulations prescribe, exempt from the inspection requirements of
    this subchapter the slaughter of animals, and the preparation of
    carcasses, parts thereof, meat and meat food products, by any
    person, firm, or corporation in any Territory not organized with a
    legislative body solely for distribution within such Territory when
    the Secretary determines that it is impracticable to provide such
    inspection within the limits of funds appropriated for
    administration of this chapter and that such exemption will
    otherwise facilitate enforcement of this chapter. The Secretary may
    refuse, withdraw, or modify any exemption under this subsection in
    his discretion whenever he determines such action is necessary to
    effectuate the purposes of this chapter.
    (c) Pizzas containing meat food products
      (1) Under such terms and conditions as the Secretary shall
    prescribe through rules and regulations issued under section 624 of
    this title that may be necessary to ensure food safety and protect
    public health such as special handling procedures, the Secretary
    shall exempt pizzas containing a meat food product from the
    inspection requirements of this chapter if - 
        (A) the meat food product components of the pizzas have been
      prepared, inspected, and passed in a cured or cooked form as
      ready-to-eat in compliance with the requirements of this chapter;
      and
        (B) the pizzas are to be served in public or private nonprofit
      institutions.

      (2) The Secretary may withdraw or modify any exemption under this
    subsection whenever the Secretary determines such action is
    necessary to ensure food safety and to protect public health. The
    Secretary may reinstate or further modify any exemption withdrawn
    or modified under this subsection.
    (d) Adulteration and misbranding provisions applicable to
      inspection-free articles
      The adulteration and misbranding provisions of this subchapter,
    other than the requirement of the inspection legend, shall apply to
    articles which are exempted from inspection or not required to be
    inspected under this section.

      The Secretary may by regulations prescribe conditions under which
    carcasses, parts of carcasses, meat, and meat food products of
    cattle, sheep, swine, goats, horses, mules, or other equines,
    capable of use as human food, shall be stored or otherwise handled
    by any person, firm, or corporation engaged in the business of
    buying, selling, freezing, storing, or transporting, in or for
    commerce, or importing, such articles, whenever the Secretary deems

    committee provided for in section 661 of this title, determines is
    adequate to effectuate the purposes of this section.

    Sec. 661. Federal and State cooperation

-STATUTE-
    (a) Congressional statement of policy
      It is the policy of the Congress to protect the consuming public
    from meat and meat food products that are adulterated or misbranded
    and to assist in efforts by State and other Government agencies to
    accomplish this objective. In furtherance of this policy - 
      (1) Development and administration of State meat inspection
        program equal to subchapter I ante and post mortem inspection,
        reinspection, and sanitation requirements
        The Secretary is authorized, whenever he determines that it
      would effectuate the purposes of this chapter, to cooperate with
      the appropriate State agency in developing and administering a
      State meat inspection program in any State which has enacted a
      State meat inspection law that imposes mandatory ante mortem and
      post mortem inspection, reinspection and sanitation requirements
      that are at least equal to those under subchapter I of this
      chapter, with respect to all or certain classes of persons
      engaged in the State in slaughtering cattle, sheep, swine, goats,
      or equines, or preparing the carcasses, parts thereof, meat or
      meat food products, of any such animals for use as human food
      solely for distribution within such State.
      (2) Development and administration of State program with
        authorities equal to subchapter II authorities; cooperation
        with Federal agencies
        The Secretary is further authorized, whenever he determines
      that it would effectuate the purposes of this chapter, to
      cooperate with appropriate State agencies in developing and
      administering State programs under State laws containing
      authorities at least equal to those provided in subchapter II of
      this chapter; and to cooperate with other agencies of the United
      States in carrying out any provisions of this chapter.
      (3) Scope of cooperation: advisory assistance, technical and
        laboratory assistance and training, and financial and other
        aid; limitation on amount; equitable allocation of Federal
        funds; adequacy of State program to obtain Federal cooperation
        and payments
        Cooperation with State agencies under this section may include
      furnishing to the appropriate State agency (i) advisory
      assistance in planning and otherwise developing an adequate State
      program under the State law; and (ii) technical and laboratory
      assistance and training (including necessary curricular and
      instructional materials and equipment), and financial and other
      aid for administration of such a program. The amount to be
      contributed to any State by the Secretary under this section from
      Federal funds for any year shall not exceed 50 per centum of the
      estimated total cost of the cooperative program; and the Federal
      funds shall be allocated among the States desiring to cooperate
      on an equitable basis. Such cooperation and payment shall be
      contingent at all times upon the administration of the State
      program in a manner which the Secretary, in consultation with the
      appropriate advisory committee appointed under paragraph (4),
      deems adequate to effectuate the purposes of this section.
      (4) Advisory committees
        The Secretary may appoint advisory committees consisting of
      such representatives of appropriate State agencies as the
      Secretary and the State agencies may designate to consult with
      him concerning State and Federal programs with respect to meat
      inspection and other matters within the scope of this chapter,
      including evaluating State programs for purposes of this chapter
      and obtaining better coordination and more uniformity among the
      State programs and between the Federal and State programs and
      adequate protection of consumers.
    (b) Single State agency; subordinate governmental unit as part of
      State agency
      The appropriate State agency with which the Secretary may
    cooperate under this chapter shall be a single agency in the State
    which is primarily responsible for the coordination of the State
    programs having objectives similar to those under this chapter.
    When the State program includes performance of certain functions by
    a municipality or other subordinate governmental unit, such unit
    shall be deemed to be a part of the State agency for purposes of
    this section.
    (c) State meat inspection requirements
    (1) Notice to Governor of nondevelopment or nonenforcement;
      designation of State as subject to subchapters I and IV; delay
      and revocation of designation; publication in Federal Register;
      notice of production of adulterated meat or meat food products;
      designation of State
      If the Secretary has reason to believe, by thirty days prior to
    the expiration of two years after December 15, 1967, that a State
    has failed to develop or is not enforcing, with respect to all
    establishments within its jurisdiction (except those that would be
    exempted from Federal inspection under subparagraph (2)) at which
    cattle, sheep, swine, goats, or equines are slaughtered, or their
    carcasses, or parts or products thereof, are prepared for use as
    human food, solely for distribution within such State, and the
    products of such establishments, requirements at least equal to
    those imposed under subchapter I and IV of this chapter, he shall
    promptly notify the Governor of the State of this fact. If the
    Secretary determines, after consultation with the Governor of the
    State, or representative selected by him, that such requirements
    have not been developed and activated, he shall promptly after the
    expiration of such two-year period designate such State as one in
    which the provisions of subchapters I and IV of this chapter shall
    apply to operations and transactions wholly within such State:
    Provided, That if the Secretary has reason to believe that the
    State will activate such requirements within one additional year,
    he may delay such designation for said period, and not designate
    the State, if he determines at the end of the year that the State
    then has such requirements in effective operation. The Secretary
    shall publish any such designation in the Federal Register and,
    upon the expiration of thirty days after such publication, the
    provisions of subchapters I and IV shall apply to operations and
    transactions and to persons, firms, and corporations engaged
    therein in the State to the same extent and in the same manner as
    if such operations and transactions were conducted in or for
    commerce. Thereafter, upon request of the Governor, the Secretary
    shall revoke such designation if the Secretary determines that such
    State has developed and will enforce requirements at least equal to
    those imposed under subchapter I and subchapter IV of this chapter:
    And provided further, That, notwithstanding any other provision of
    this section, if the Secretary determines that any establishment
    within a State is producing adulterated meat or meat food products
    for distribution within such State which would clearly endanger the
    public health he shall notify the Governor of the State and the
    appropriate Advisory Committee provided by section 661 of this
    title of such fact for effective action under State or local law.
    If the State does not take action to prevent such endangering of
    the public health within a reasonable time after such notice, as
    determined by the Secretary, in light of the risk to public health,
    the Secretary may forthwith designate any such establishment as
    subject to the provisions of subchapters I and IV of this chapter,
    and thereupon the establishment and operator thereof shall be
    subject to such provisions as though engaged in commerce until such
    time as the Secretary determines that such State has developed and
    will enforce requirements at least equal to those imposed under
    subchapter I and subchapter IV of this chapter.
    (2) Exemptions of retail stores, restaurants, and similar retail-
      type establishments; operations conducted at a restaurant
      central kitchen facility
      The provisions of this chapter requiring inspection of the
    slaughter of animals and the preparation of carcasses, parts
    thereof, meat and meat food products shall not apply to operations
    of types traditionally and usually conducted at retail stores and
    restaurants, when conducted at any retail store or restaurant or
    similar retail-type establishment for sale in normal retail
    quantities or service of such articles to consumers at such
    establishments if such establishments are subject to such
    inspection provisions only under this paragraph (c). For the
    purposes of this subparagraph, operations conducted at a restaurant
    central kitchen facility shall be considered as being conducted at
    a restaurant if the restaurant central kitchen prepares meat or
    meat food products that are ready to eat when they leave such
    facility and are served in meals or as entrees only to customers at
    restaurants owned or operated by the same person, firm, or
    corporation owning or operating such facility: Provided, That such
    facility shall be subject to the provisions of section 642 of this
    title: Provided further, That the facility may be subject to the
    inspection requirements under subchapter I of this chapter for as
    long as the Secretary deems necessary, if the Secretary determines
    that the sanitary conditions or practices of the facility or the
    processing procedures or methods at the facility are such that any

      provisions for withdrawal of services unaffected; responsible
      connection with business; finality of Secretary's actions;

-STATUTE-
      The Secretary may (for such period, or indefinitely, as he deems
    necessary to effectuate the purposes of this chapter) refuse to
    provide, or withdraw, inspection service under subchapter I of this
    chapter with respect to any establishment if he determines, after
    opportunity for a hearing is accorded to the applicant for, or
    recipient of, such service, that such applicant or recipient is
    unfit to engage in any business requiring inspection under
    subchapter I because the applicant or recipient, or anyone
    responsibly connected with the applicant or recipient, has been
    convicted, in any Federal or State court, of (1) any felony, or (2)
    more than one violation of any law, other than a felony, based upon
    the acquiring, handling, or distributing of unwholesome,
    mislabeled, or deceptively packaged food or upon fraud in
    connection with transactions in food. This section shall not affect
    in any way other provisions of this chapter for withdrawal of
    inspection services under subchapter I from establishments failing
    to maintain sanitary conditions or to destroy condemned carcasses,
    parts, meat or meat food products.
      For the purpose of this section a person shall be deemed to be
    responsibly connected with the business if he was a partner,
    officer, director, holder, or owner of 10 per centum or more of its
    voting stock or employee in a managerial or executive capacity.
      The determination and order of the Secretary with respect thereto
    under this section shall be final and conclusive unless the
    affected applicant for, or recipient of, inspection service files
    application for judicial review within thirty days after the
    effective date of such order in the appropriate court as provided
    in section 674 of this title. Judicial review of any such order
    shall be upon the record upon which the determination and order are
    based.

    Sec. 801. Congressional findings and declarations: controlled
      substances

-STATUTE-
      The Congress makes the following findings and declarations:
      (1) Many of the drugs included within this subchapter have a
    useful and legitimate medical purpose and are necessary to maintain
    the health and general welfare of the American people.
      (2) The illegal importation, manufacture, distribution, and
    possession and improper use of controlled substances have a
    substantial and detrimental effect on the health and general
    welfare of the American people.
      (3) A major portion of the traffic in controlled substances flows
    through interstate and foreign commerce. Incidents of the traffic
    which are not an integral part of the interstate or foreign flow,
    such as manufacture, local distribution, and possession,
    nonetheless have a substantial and direct effect upon interstate
    commerce because - 
        (A) after manufacture, many controlled substances are
      transported in interstate commerce,
        (B) controlled substances distributed locally usually have been
      transported in interstate commerce immediately before their
      distribution, and
        (C) controlled substances possessed commonly flow through
      interstate commerce immediately prior to such possession.

      (4) Local distribution and possession of controlled substances
    contribute to swelling the interstate traffic in such substances.
      (5) Controlled substances manufactured and distributed intrastate
    cannot be differentiated from controlled substances manufactured
    and distributed interstate. Thus, it is not feasible to
    distinguish, in terms of controls, between controlled substances
    manufactured and distributed interstate and controlled substances
    manufactured and distributed intrastate.
      (6) Federal control of the intrastate incidents of the traffic in
    controlled substances is essential to the effective control of the
    interstate incidents of such traffic.
      (7) The United States is a party to the Single Convention on
    Narcotic Drugs, 1961, and other international conventions designed
    to establish effective control over international and domestic
    traffic in controlled substances.

      "SEC. 3002. FINDINGS.
      "The Congress hereby finds that - 
        "(1) a balanced, coordinated, multifaceted strategy for
      combating the growing drug abuse and drug trafficking problem in
      the United States is essential in order to stop the flow and
      abuse of drugs within our borders;
        "(2) a balanced, coordinated, multifaceted strategy for
      combating the narcotics drug abuse and trafficking in the United
      States should include - 
          "(A) increased investigations of large networks of drug
        smuggler organizations;
          "(B) source country drug eradication;
          "(C) increased emphasis on stopping narcotics traffickers in
        countries through which drugs are transshipped;
          "(D) increased emphasis on drug education programs in the
        schools and workplace;
          "(E) increased Federal Government assistance to State and
        local agencies, civic groups, school systems, and officials in
        their efforts to combat the drug abuse and trafficking problem
        at the local level; and
          "(F) increased emphasis on the interdiction of drugs and drug
        smugglers at the borders of the United States, in the air, at
        sea, and on the land;
        "(3) funds to support the interdiction of narcotics smugglers
      who threaten the transport of drugs through the air, on the sea,
      and across the land borders of the United States should be
      emphasized in the Federal Government budget process to the same
      extent as the other elements of a comprehensive antidrug effort
      are emphasized;
        "(4) the Department of Defense and the use of its resources
      should be an integral part of a comprehensive, natonal [national]
      drug interdiction program;
        "(5) the Federal Government civilian agencies engaged in drug
      interdiction, particularly the United States Customs Service and
      the Coast Guard, currently lack the aircraft, ships, radar,
      command, control, communications, and intelligence (C3I) system,
      and manpower resources necessary to mount a comprehensive attack
      on the narcotics traffickers who threaten the United States;
        "(6) the civilian drug interdiction agencies of the United
      States are currently interdicting only a small percentage of the
      illegal, drug smuggler penetrations in the United States every
      year;
        "(7) the budgets for our civilian drug interdiction agencies,
      primarily the United States Customs Service and the Coast Guard,
      have not kept pace with those of the traditional investigative
      law enforcement agencies of the Department of Justice; and
        "(8) since the amendment of the Posse Comitatus Act (18 U.S.C.
      1385) in 1981, the Department of Defense has assisted in the
      effort to interdict drugs, but they can do more.

      "SEC. 3003. PURPOSES.
      "It is the purpose of this title - 
        "(1) to increase the level of funding and resources available
      to civilian drug interdiction agencies of the Federal Government;
        "(2) to increase the level of support from the Department of
      Defense as consistent with the Posse Comitatus Act [18 U.S.C.
      1385], for interdiction of the narcotics traffickers before such
      traffickers penetrate the borders of the United States; and
        "(3) to improve other drug interdiction programs of the Federal
      Government.

      docking facility in the Bahamas to facilitate Coast Guard and
      Bahamian drug interdiction operations in and through the Bahama
      Islands. Of the amounts authorized to be appropriated in this
      subsection, such sums as may be necessary shall be available for
      necessary communication and air support.
        "(B) The Commandant of the Coast Guard shall use such amounts
      appropriated pursuant to the authorization in this paragraph as
      may be necessary to establish a repair, maintenance, and boat
      lift facility to provide repair and maintenance services for both
      Coast Guard and Bahamian marine drug interdiction equipment,
      vessels, and related assets.

    Human Services to contract with Institute of Medicine of National
    Academy of Sciences to conduct a study of extent to which cost of
    drug abuse treatment is covered by private insurance, public
    programs, and other sources of payment, and adequacy of such

      "(a) Findings. - The Congress finds that - 
        "(1) drug and alcohol abuse are problems of grave concern and
      consequence in American society;
        "(2) over 500,000 individuals are known heroin addicts; 5
      million individuals use cocaine; and at least 7 million
      individuals regularly use prescription drugs, mostly addictive
      ones, without medical supervision;
        "(3) 10 million adults and 3 million children and adolescents
      abuse alcohol, and an additional 30 to 40 million people are
      adversely affected because of close family ties to alcoholics;
        "(4) the total cost of drug abuse to the Nation in 1983 was
      over $60,000,000,000; and
        "(5) the vast majority of health benefits plans provide only
      limited coverage for treatment of drug and alcohol addiction,
      which is a fact that can discourage the abuser from seeking
      treatment or, if the abuser does seek treatment, can cause the
      abuser to face significant out of pocket expenses for the
      treatment.
      "(b) Sense of Congress. - It is the sense of Congress that - 
        "(1) all employers providing health insurance policies should
      ensure that the policies provide adequate coverage for treatment
      of drug and alcohol addiction in recognition that the health
      consequences and costs for individuals and society can be as
      formidable as those resulting from other diseases and illnesses
      for which insurance coverage is much more adequate; and
        "(2) State insurance commissioners should encourage employers
      providing health benefits plans to ensure that the policies
      provide more adequate coverage for treatment of drug and alcohol
      addiction."

    the Commission shall constitute a quorum, but a lesser number may

-HEAD-
    Sec. 801a. Congressional findings and declarations: psychotropic
      substances

-STATUTE-
      The Congress makes the following findings and declarations:
        (1) The Congress has long recognized the danger involved in the
      manufacture, distribution, and use of certain psychotropic
      substances for nonscientific and nonmedical purposes, and has
      provided strong and effective legislation to control illicit
      trafficking and to regulate legitimate uses of psychotropic
      substances in this country. Abuse of psychotropic substances has
      become a phenomenon common to many countries, however, and is not
      confined to national borders. It is, therefore, essential that
      the United States cooperate with other nations in establishing
      effective controls over international traffic in such substances.
        (2) The United States has joined with other countries in
      executing an international treaty, entitled the Convention on
      Psychotropic Substances and signed at Vienna, Austria, on
      February 21, 1971, which is designed to establish suitable
      controls over the manufacture, distribution, transfer, and use of
      certain psychotropic substances. The Convention is not self-
      executing, and the obligations of the United States thereunder
      may only be performed pursuant to appropriate legislation. It is
      the intent of the Congress that the amendments made by this Act,
      together with existing law, will enable the United States to meet
      all of its obligations under the Convention and that no further
      legislation will be necessary for that purpose.
        (3) In implementing the Convention on Psychotropic Substances,
      the Congress intends that, consistent with the obligations of the
      United States under the Convention, control of psychotropic
      substances in the United States should be accomplished within the
      framework of the procedures and criteria for classification of
      substances provided in the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention
      and Control Act of 1970 [21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.]. This will insure
      that (A) the availability of psychotropic substances to
      manufacturers, distributors, dispensers, and researchers for
      useful and legitimate medical and scientific purposes will not be
      unduly restricted; (B) nothing in the Convention will interfere
      with bona fide research activities; and (C) nothing in the
      Convention will interfere with ethical medical practice in this
      country as determined by the Secretary of Health and Human
      Services on the basis of a consensus of the views of the American
      medical and scientific community.

    illicit drugs. Sources of data for the study shall include the
    following:
        "(1) Information from Federal, State, and local clandestine
      laboratory seizures and related investigations identifying the
      source, type, or brand of drug products being utilized and how
      they were obtained for the illicit production of methamphetamine

      submit to Congress a report on the study conducted under

          "(A) the findings of the Attorney General as a result of the
        study; and
          "(B) such recommendations on the need to establish additional
        measures to prevent diversion of ordinary, over-the-counter
        pseudoephedrine and phenylpropanolamine (such as a threshold on
        ordinary, over-the-counter pseudoephedrine and
        phenylpropanolamine products) as the Attorney General considers
        appropriate.

      including the comments on the Attorney General's proposed

      transaction limit of not less than 24 grams of ordinary, over-
      the-counter pseudoephedrine or phenylpropanolamine (as the case
      may be) for retail distributors, if the Attorney General finds,
      in the report under subsection (b), that - 
          "(A) there is a significant number of instances (as set forth
        in paragraph (3)(A) of such section 401(d) for purposes of such
        section) where ordinary, over-the-counter pseudoephedrine
        products, phenylpropanolamine products, or both such products
        that were purchased from retail distributors were widely used
        in the clandestine production of illicit drugs; and
          "(B) the best practical method of preventing such use is the
        establishment of single-transaction limits for retail
        distributors of either or both of such products.
        "(2) Due process. - The Attorney General shall establish the
      single-transaction limit under paragraph (1) only after notice,
      comment, and an informal hearing."

-STATUTE-
    (a) Rules and regulations of Attorney General; hearing
      The Attorney General shall apply the provisions of this
    subchapter to the controlled substances listed in the schedules
    established by section 812 of this title and to any other drug or
    other substance added to such schedules under this subchapter.
    Except as provided in subsections (d) and (e) of this section, the
    Attorney General may by rule - 
        (1) add to such a schedule or transfer between such schedules
      any drug or other substance if he - 
          (A) finds that such drug or other substance has a potential
        for abuse, and
          (B) makes with respect to such drug or other substance the
        findings prescribed by subsection (b) of section 812 of this
        title for the schedule in which such drug is to be placed; or

        (2) remove any drug or other substance from the schedules if he
      finds that the drug or other substance does not meet the
      requirements for inclusion in any schedule.

    Rules of the Attorney General under this subsection shall be made
    on the record after opportunity for a hearing pursuant to the
    rulemaking procedures prescribed by subchapter II of chapter 5 of
    title 5. Proceedings for the issuance, amendment, or repeal of such
    rules may be initiated by the Attorney General (1) on his own
    motion, (2) at the request of the Secretary, or (3) on the petition
    of any interested party.
    (b) Evaluation of drugs and other substances
      The Attorney General shall, before initiating proceedings under
    subsection (a) of this section to control a drug or other substance
    or to remove a drug or other substance entirely from the schedules,
    and after gathering the necessary data, request from the Secretary
    a scientific and medical evaluation, and his recommendations, as to
    whether such drug or other substance should be so controlled or
    removed as a controlled substance. In making such evaluation and
    recommendations, the Secretary shall consider the factors listed in
    paragraphs (2), (3), (6), (7), and (8) of subsection (c) of this
    section and any scientific or medical considerations involved in
    paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of such subsection. The
    recommendations of the Secretary shall include recommendations with
    respect to the appropriate schedule, if any, under which such drug
    or other substance should be listed. The evaluation and the
    recommendations of the Secretary shall be made in writing and
    submitted to the Attorney General within a reasonable time. The
    recommendations of the Secretary to the Attorney General shall be
    binding on the Attorney General as to such scientific and medical
    matters, and if the Secretary recommends that a drug or other
    substance not be controlled, the Attorney General shall not control
    the drug or other substance. If the Attorney General determines
    that these facts and all other relevant data constitute substantial
    evidence of potential for abuse such as to warrant control or
    substantial evidence that the drug or other substance should be
    removed entirely from the schedules, he shall initiate proceedings
    for control or removal, as the case may be, under subsection (a) of
    this section.
    (c) Factors determinative of control or removal from schedules
      In making any finding under subsection (a) of this section or
    under subsection (b) of section 812 of this title, the Attorney
    General shall consider the following factors with respect to each
    drug or other substance proposed to be controlled or removed from
    the schedules:
        (1) Its actual or relative potential for abuse.
        (2) Scientific evidence of its pharmacological effect, if
      known.
        (3) The state of current scientific knowledge regarding the
      drug or other substance.
        (4) Its history and current pattern of abuse.
        (5) The scope, duration, and significance of abuse.
        (6) What, if any, risk there is to the public health.
        (7) Its psychic or physiological dependence liability.
        (8) Whether the substance is an immediate precursor of a
      substance already controlled under this subchapter.
    (d) International treaties, conventions, and protocols requiring
      control; procedures respecting changes in drug schedules of
      Convention on Psychotropic Substances
      (1) If control is required by United States obligations under
    international treaties, conventions, or protocols in effect on
    October 27, 1970, the Attorney General shall issue an order
    controlling such drug under the schedule he deems most appropriate
    to carry out such obligations, without regard to the findings
    required by subsection (a) of this section or section 812(b) of
    this title and without regard to the procedures prescribed by
    subsections (a) and (b) of this section.
      (2)(A) Whenever the Secretary of State receives notification from
    the Secretary-General of the United Nations that information has
    been transmitted by or to the World Health Organization, pursuant
    to article 2 of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, which
    may justify adding a drug or other substance to one of the
    schedules of the Convention, transferring a drug or substance from
    one schedule to another, or deleting it from the schedules, the
    Secretary of State shall immediately transmit the notice to the
    Secretary of Health and Human Services who shall publish it in the
    Federal Register and provide opportunity to interested persons to
    submit to him comments respecting the scientific and medical
    evaluations which he is to prepare respecting such drug or
    substance. The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall prepare
    for transmission through the Secretary of State to the World Health
    Organization such medical and scientific evaluations as may be
    appropriate regarding the possible action that could be proposed by
    the World Health Organization respecting the drug or substance with
    respect to which a notice was transmitted under this subparagraph.
      (B) Whenever the Secretary of State receives information that the
    Commission on Narcotic Drugs of the United Nations proposes to
    decide whether to add a drug or other substance to one of the
    schedules of the Convention, transfer a drug or substance from one
    schedule to another, or delete it from the schedules, the Secretary
    of State shall transmit timely notice to the Secretary of Health
    and Human Services of such information who shall publish a summary
    of such information in the Federal Register and provide opportunity
    to interested persons to submit to him comments respecting the
    recommendation which he is to furnish, pursuant to this
    subparagraph, respecting such proposal. The Secretary of Health and
    Human Services shall evaluate the proposal and furnish a
    recommendation to the Secretary of State which shall be binding on
    the representative of the United States in discussions and
    negotiations relating to the proposal.
      (3) When the United States receives notification of a scheduling
    decision pursuant to article 2 of the Convention on Psychotropic
    Substances that a drug or other substance has been added or
    transferred to a schedule specified in the notification or receives
    notification (referred to in this subsection as a "schedule
    notice") that existing legal controls applicable under this
    subchapter to a drug or substance and the controls required by the
    Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.] do not
    meet the requirements of the schedule of the Convention in which
    such drug or substance has been placed, the Secretary of Health and
    Human Services after consultation with the Attorney General, shall
    first determine whether existing legal controls under this
    subchapter applicable to the drug or substance and the controls
    required by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, meet the
    requirements of the schedule specified in the notification or
    schedule notice and shall take the following action:
        (A) If such requirements are met by such existing controls but
      the Secretary of Health and Human Services nonetheless believes
      that more stringent controls should be applied to the drug or
      substance, the Secretary shall recommend to the Attorney General
      that he initiate proceedings for scheduling the drug or
      substance, pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of this section,
      to apply to such controls.
        (B) If such requirements are not met by such existing controls
      and the Secretary of Health and Human Services concurs in the
      scheduling decision or schedule notice transmitted by the
      notification, the Secretary shall recommend to the Attorney
      General that he initiate proceedings for scheduling the drug or
      substance under the appropriate schedule pursuant to subsections
      (a) and (b) of this section.
        (C) If such requirements are not met by such existing controls
      and the Secretary of Health and Human Services does not concur in
      the scheduling decision or schedule notice transmitted by the
      notification, the Secretary shall - 
          (i) if he deems that additional controls are necessary to
        protect the public health and safety, recommend to the Attorney
        General that he initiate proceedings for scheduling the drug or
        substance pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of this section,
        to apply such additional controls;
          (ii) request the Secretary of State to transmit a notice of
        qualified acceptance, within the period specified in the
        Convention, pursuant to paragraph 7 of article 2 of the
        Convention, to the Secretary-General of the United Nations;
          (iii) request the Secretary of State to transmit a notice of
        qualified acceptance as prescribed in clause (ii) and request
        the Secretary of State to ask for a review by the Economic and
        Social Council of the United Nations, in accordance with
        paragraph 8 of article 2 of the Convention, of the scheduling
        decision; or
          (iv) in the case of a schedule notice, request the Secretary
        of State to take appropriate action under the Convention to
        initiate proceedings to remove the drug or substance from the
        schedules under the Convention or to transfer the drug or
        substance to a schedule under the Convention different from the
        one specified in the schedule notice.

      (4)(A) If the Attorney General determines, after consultation
    with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, that proceedings
    initiated under recommendations made under paragraph (!1) (B) or
    (C)(i) of paragraph (3) will not be completed within the time
    period required by paragraph 7 of article 2 of the Convention, the
    Attorney General, after consultation with the Secretary and after
    providing interested persons opportunity to submit comments
    respecting the requirements of the temporary order to be issued
    under this sentence, shall issue a temporary order controlling the
    drug or substance under schedule IV or V, whichever is most
    appropriate to carry out the minimum United States obligations
    under paragraph 7 of article 2 of the Convention. As a part of such
    order, the Attorney General shall, after consultation with the
    Secretary, except such drug or substance from the application of
    any provision of part C of this subchapter which he finds is not
    required to carry out the United States obligations under paragraph
    7 of article 2 of the Convention. In the case of proceedings
    initiated under subparagraph (B) of paragraph (3), the Attorney
    General, concurrently with the issuance of such order, shall
    request the Secretary of State to transmit a notice of qualified
    acceptance to the Secretary-General of the United Nations pursuant
    to paragraph 7 of article 2 of the Convention. A temporary order
    issued under this subparagraph controlling a drug or other
    substance subject to proceedings initiated under subsections (a)
    and (b) of this section shall expire upon the effective date of the
    application to the drug or substance of the controls resulting from
    such proceedings.

      (B) After a notice of qualified acceptance of a scheduling
    decision with respect to a drug or other substance is transmitted
    to the Secretary-General of the United Nations in accordance with
    clause (ii) or (iii) of paragraph (3)(C) or after a request has
    been made under clause (iv) of such paragraph with respect to a
    drug or substance described in a schedule notice, the Attorney
    General, after consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human
    Services and after providing interested persons opportunity to
    submit comments respecting the requirements of the order to be
    issued under this sentence, shall issue an order controlling the
    drug or substance under schedule IV or V, whichever is most
    appropriate to carry out the minimum United States obligations
    under paragraph 7 of article 2 of the Convention in the case of a
    drug or substance for which a notice of qualified acceptance was
    transmitted or whichever the Attorney General determines is
    appropriate in the case of a drug or substance described in a
    schedule notice. As a part of such order, the Attorney General
    shall, after consultation with the Secretary, except such drug or
    substance from the application of any provision of part C of this
    subchapter which he finds is not required to carry out the United
    States obligations under paragraph 7 of article 2 of the
    Convention. If, as a result of a review under paragraph 8 of
    article 2 of the Convention of the scheduling decision with respect
    to which a notice of qualified acceptance was transmitted in
    accordance with clause (ii) or (iii) of paragraph (3)(C) - 
        (i) the decision is reversed, and
        (ii) the drug or substance subject to such decision is not
      required to be controlled under schedule IV or V to carry out the
      minimum United States obligations under paragraph 7 of article 2
      of the Convention,

    the order issued under this subparagraph with respect to such drug
    or substance shall expire upon receipt by the United States of the
    review decision. If, as a result of action taken pursuant to action
    initiated under a request transmitted under clause (iv) of
    paragraph (3)(C), the drug or substance with respect to which such
    action was taken is not required to be controlled under schedule IV
    or V, the order issued under this paragraph with respect to such
    drug or substance shall expire upon receipt by the United States of
    a notice of the action taken with respect to such drug or substance
    under the Convention.
      (C) An order issued under subparagraph (A) or (B) may be issued
    without regard to the findings required by subsection (a) of this
    section or by section 812(b) of this title and without regard to
    the procedures prescribed by subsection (a) or (b) of this section.
      (5) Nothing in the amendments made by the Psychotropic Substances
    Act of 1978 or the regulations or orders promulgated thereunder
    shall be construed to preclude requests by the Secretary of Health
    and Human Services or the Attorney General through the Secretary of
    State, pursuant to article 2 or other applicable provisions of the
    Convention, for review of scheduling decisions under such
    Convention, based on new or additional information.
    (e) Immediate precursors
      The Attorney General may, without regard to the findings required
    by subsection (a) of this section or section 812(b) of this title
    and without regard to the procedures prescribed by subsections (a)
    and (b) of this section, place an immediate precursor in the same
    schedule in which the controlled substance of which it is an
    immediate precursor is placed or in any other schedule with a
    higher numerical designation. If the Attorney General designates a
    substance as an immediate precursor and places it in a schedule,
    other substances shall not be placed in a schedule solely because
    they are its precursors.
    (f) Abuse potential
      If, at the time a new-drug application is submitted to the
    Secretary for any drug having a stimulant, depressant, or
    hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous system, it appears
    that such drug has an abuse potential, such information shall be
    forwarded by the Secretary to the Attorney General.
    (g) Exclusion of non-narcotic substances sold over the counter
      without a prescription; dextromethorphan; exemption of substances
      lacking abuse potential
      (1) The Attorney General shall by regulation exclude any non-
    narcotic drug which contains a controlled substance from the
    application of this subchapter and subchapter II of this chapter if
    such drug may, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [21
    U.S.C. 301 et seq.], be lawfully sold over the counter without a
    prescription.
      (2) Dextromethorphan shall not be deemed to be included in any
    schedule by reason of enactment of this subchapter unless
    controlled after October 27, 1970 pursuant to the foregoing
    provisions of this section.
      (3) The Attorney General may, by regulation, exempt any compound,
    mixture, or preparation containing a controlled substance from the
    application of all or any part of this subchapter if he finds such
    compound, mixture, or preparation meets the requirements of one of
    the following categories:
        (A) A mixture, or preparation containing a nonnarcotic
      controlled substance, which mixture or preparation is approved
      for prescription use, and which contains one or more other active
      ingredients which are not listed in any schedule and which are
      included therein in such combinations, quantity, proportion, or
      concentration as to vitiate the potential for abuse.
        (B) A compound, mixture, or preparation which contains any
      controlled substance, which is not for administration to a human
      being or animal, and which is packaged in such form or
      concentration, or with adulterants or denaturants, so that as
      packaged it does not present any significant potential for abuse.
        (C) Upon the recommendation of the Secretary of Health and
      Human Services, a compound, mixture, or preparation which
      contains any anabolic steroid, which is intended for
      administration to a human being or an animal, and which, because
      of its concentration, preparation, formulation or delivery
      system, does not present any significant potential for abuse.
    (h) Temporary scheduling to avoid imminent hazards to public safety
      (1) If the Attorney General finds that the scheduling of a
    substance in schedule I on a temporary basis is necessary to avoid
    an imminent hazard to the public safety, he may, by order and
    without regard to the requirements of subsection (b) of this
    section relating to the Secretary of Health and Human Services,
    schedule such substance in schedule I if the substance is not
    listed in any other schedule in section 812 of this title or if no
    exemption or approval is in effect for the substance under section
    505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [21 U.S.C. 355].
    Such an order may not be issued before the expiration of thirty
    days from - 
        (A) the date of the publication by the Attorney General of a
      notice in the Federal Register of the intention to issue such
      order and the grounds upon which such order is to be issued, and
        (B) the date the Attorney General has transmitted the notice
      required by paragraph (4).

      (2) The scheduling of a substance under this subsection shall
    expire at the end of one year from the date of the issuance of the
    order scheduling such substance, except that the Attorney General
    may, during the pendency of proceedings under subsection (a)(1) of
    this section with respect to the substance, extend the temporary
    scheduling for up to six months.
      (3) When issuing an order under paragraph (1), the Attorney
    General shall be required to consider, with respect to the finding
    of an imminent hazard to the public safety, only those factors set
    forth in paragraphs (4), (5), and (6) of subsection (c) of this
    section, including actual abuse, diversion from legitimate
    channels, and clandestine importation, manufacture, or
    distribution.
      (4) The Attorney General shall transmit notice of an order
    proposed to be issued under paragraph (1) to the Secretary of
    Health and Human Services. In issuing an order under paragraph (1),
    the Attorney General shall take into consideration any comments
    submitted by the Secretary in response to a notice transmitted
    pursuant to this paragraph.
      (5) An order issued under paragraph (1) with respect to a
    substance shall be vacated upon the conclusion of a subsequent
    rulemaking proceeding initiated under subsection (a) of this
    section with respect to such substance.
      (6) An order issued under paragraph (1) is not subject to
    judicial review.

     CONGRESSIONAL FINDING; EMERGENCY SCHEDULING OF GHB IN CONTROLLED
                              SUBSTANCES ACT
      Pub. L. 106-172, Secs. 2, 3(a), Feb. 18, 2000, 114 Stat. 7, 8,
    provided that:

      "SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
      "Congress finds as follows:
        "(1) Gamma hydroxybutyric acid (also called G, Liquid X, Liquid
      Ecstasy, Grievous Bodily Harm, Georgia Home Boy, Scoop) has
      become a significant and growing problem in law enforcement. At
      least 20 States have scheduled such drug in their drug laws and
      law enforcement officials have been experiencing an increased
      presence of the drug in driving under the influence, sexual
      assault, and overdose cases especially at night clubs and
      parties.
        "(2) A behavioral depressant and a hypnotic, gamma
      hydroxybutyric acid ('GHB') is being used in conjunction with
      alcohol and other drugs with detrimental effects in an increasing
      number of cases. It is difficult to isolate the impact of such
      drug's ingestion since it is so typically taken with an ever-
      changing array of other drugs and especially alcohol which
      potentiates its impact.
        "(3) GHB takes the same path as alcohol, processes via alcohol
      dehydrogenase, and its symptoms at high levels of intake and as
      impact builds are comparable to alcohol ingestion/intoxication.
      Thus, aggression and violence can be expected in some individuals
      who use such drug.
        "(4) If taken for human consumption, common industrial
      chemicals such as gamma butyrolactone and 1.4-butanediol are
      swiftly converted by the body into GHB. Illicit use of these and
      other GHB analogues and precursor chemicals is a significant and
      growing law enforcement problem.
        "(5) A human pharmaceutical formulation of gamma hydroxybutyric
      acid is being developed as a treatment for cataplexy, a serious
      and debilitating disease. Cataplexy, which causes sudden and
      total loss of muscle control, affects about 65 percent of the
      estimated 180,000 Americans with narcolepsy, a sleep disorder.
      People with cataplexy often are unable to work, drive a car, hold
      their children or live a normal life.
        "(6) Abuse of illicit GHB is an imminent hazard to public
      safety that requires immediate regulatory action under the
      Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.).

      "SEC. 3. EMERGENCY SCHEDULING OF GAMMA HYDROXYBUTYRIC ACID AND
        LISTING OF GAMMA BUTYROLACTONE AS LIST I CHEMICAL.
      "(a) Emergency Scheduling of GHB. - 
        "(1) In general. - The Congress finds that the abuse of illicit
      gamma hydroxybutyric acid is an imminent hazard to the public
      safety. Accordingly, the Attorney General, notwithstanding
      sections 201(a), 201(b), 201(c), and 202 of the Controlled
      Substances Act [21 U.S.C. 811(a)-(c), 812], shall issue, not
      later than 60 days after the date of the enactment of this Act
      [Feb. 18, 2000], a final order that schedules such drug (together
      with its salts, isomers, and salts of isomers) in the same
      schedule under section 202(c) of the Controlled Substances Act as
      would apply to a scheduling of a substance by the Attorney
      General under section 201(h)(1) of such Act (relating to imminent
      hazards to the public safety), except as follows:
          "(A) For purposes of any requirements that relate to the
        physical security of registered manufacturers and registered
        distributors, the final order shall treat such drug, when the
        drug is manufactured, distributed, or possessed in accordance
        with an exemption under section 505(i) of the Federal Food,
        Drug, and Cosmetic Act [21 U.S.C. 355(i)] (whether the
        exemption involved is authorized before, on, or after the date
        of the enactment of this Act [Feb. 18, 2000]), as being in the
        same schedule as that recommended by the Secretary of Health
        and Human Services for the drug when the drug is the subject of
        an authorized investigational new drug application (relating to
        such section 505(i)). The recommendation referred to in the
        preceding sentence is contained in the first paragraph of the
        letter transmitted on May 19, 1999, by such Secretary (acting
        through the Assistant Secretary for Health) to the Attorney
        General (acting through the Deputy Administrator of the Drug
        Enforcement Administration), which letter was in response to
        the letter transmitted by the Attorney General (acting through
        such Deputy Administrator) on September 16, 1997. In publishing
        the final order in the Federal Register, the Attorney General
        shall publish a copy of the letter that was transmitted by the
        Secretary of Health and Human Services.
          "(B) In the case of gamma hydroxybutyric acid that is
        contained in a drug product for which an application is
        approved under section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and
        Cosmetic Act [21 U.S.C. 355] (whether the application involved
        is approved before, on, or after the date of the enactment of
        this Act [Feb. 18, 2000]), the final order shall schedule such
        drug in the same schedule as that recommended by the Secretary
        of Health and Human Services for authorized formulations of the
        drug. The recommendation referred to in the preceding sentence
        is contained in the last sentence of the fourth paragraph of
        the letter referred to in subparagraph (A) with respect to May
        19, 1999.
        "(2) Failure to issue order. - If the final order is not issued
      within the period specified in paragraph (1), gamma
      hydroxybutyric acid (together with its salts, isomers, and salts
      of isomers) is deemed to be scheduled under section 202(c) of the
      Controlled Substances Act [21 U.S.C. 812(c)] in accordance with
      the policies described in paragraph (1), as if the Attorney
      General had issued a final order in accordance with such
      paragraph."

        PLACEMENT OF PIPRADROL AND SPA IN SCHEDULE IV TO CARRY OUT
          OBLIGATION UNDER CONVENTION ON PSYCHOTROPIC SUBSTANCES
      Section 102(c) of Pub. L. 95-633 provided that: "For the purpose
    of carrying out the minimum United States obligations under
    paragraph 7 of article 2 of the Convention on Psychotropic
    Substances, signed at Vienna, Austria, on February 21, 1971, with
    respect to pipradrol and SPA (also known as (-)-1-dimethylamino-1,2-
    diphenylethane), the Attorney General shall by order, made without
    regard to sections 201 and 202 of the Controlled Substances Act
    [this section and section 811 of this title], place such drugs in
    schedule IV of such Act [see subsec. (c) of this section]."
      Provision of section 102(c) of Pub. L. 95-633, set out above,
    effective on the date the Convention on Psychotropic Substances
    enters into force in the United States [July 15, 1980], see section

-HEAD-
    Sec. 814. Removal of exemption of certain drugs

-STATUTE-
    (a) Removal of exemption
      The Attorney General shall by regulation remove from exemption
    under section 802(39)(A)(iv) of this title a drug or group of drugs
    that the Attorney General finds is being diverted to obtain a
    listed chemical for use in the illicit production of a controlled
    substance.
    (b) Factors to be considered
      In removing a drug or group of drugs from exemption under
    subsection (a) of this section, the Attorney General shall
    consider, with respect to a drug or group of drugs that is proposed
    to be removed from exemption - 
        (1) the scope, duration, and significance of the diversion;
        (2) whether the drug or group of drugs is formulated in such a
      way that it cannot be easily used in the illicit production of a
      controlled substance; and
        (3) whether the listed chemical can be readily recovered from
      the drug or group of drugs.
    (c) Specificity of designation
      The Attorney General shall limit the designation of a drug or a
    group of drugs removed from exemption under subsection (a) of this
    section to the most particularly identifiable type of drug or group
    of drugs for which evidence of diversion exists unless there is
    evidence, based on the pattern of diversion and other relevant
    factors, that the diversion will not be limited to that particular
    drug or group of drugs.
    (d) Reinstatement of exemption with respect to particular drug
      products
      (1) Reinstatement
        On application by a manufacturer of a particular drug product
      that has been removed from exemption under subsection (a) of this
      section, the Attorney General shall by regulation reinstate the
      exemption with respect to that particular drug product if the
      Attorney General determines that the particular drug product is
      manufactured and distributed in a manner that prevents diversion.
      (2) Factors to be considered
        In deciding whether to reinstate the exemption with respect to
      a particular drug product under paragraph (1), the Attorney
      General shall consider - 
          (A) the package sizes and manner of packaging of the drug
        product;
          (B) the manner of distribution and advertising of the drug
        product;
          (C) evidence of diversion of the drug product;
          (D) any actions taken by the manufacturer to prevent
        diversion of the drug product; and
          (E) such other factors as are relevant to and consistent with
        the public health and safety, including the factors described
        in subsection (b) of this section as applied to the drug
        product.
      (3) Status pending application for reinstatement
        A transaction involving a particular drug product that is the
      subject of a bona fide pending application for reinstatement of
      exemption filed with the Attorney General not later than 60 days
      after a regulation removing the exemption is issued pursuant to
      subsection (a) of this section shall not be considered to be a
      regulated transaction if the transaction occurs during the
      pendency of the application and, if the Attorney General denies
      the application, during the period of 60 days following the date
      on which the Attorney General denies the application, unless - 
          (A) the Attorney General has evidence that, applying the
        factors described in subsection (b) of this section to the drug
        product, the drug product is being diverted; and
          (B) the Attorney General so notifies the applicant.
      (4) Amendment and modification
        A regulation reinstating an exemption under paragraph (1) may
      be modified or revoked with respect to a particular drug product
      upon a finding that - 
          (A) applying the factors described in subsection (b) of this
        section to the drug product, the drug product is being
        diverted; or
          (B) there is a significant change in the data that led to the
        issuance of the regulation.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Manufacturers of controlled substances in schedule I or II
      The Attorney General shall register an applicant to manufacture

    controlled substances in schedule III, IV, or V, unless he
    determines that the issuance of such registration is inconsistent
    with the public interest. In determining the public interest, the
    following factors shall be considered:
        (1) maintenance of effective controls against diversion of
      particular controlled substances and any controlled substance in
      schedule III, IV, or V compounded therefrom into other than
      legitimate medical, scientific, or industrial channels;
        (2) compliance with applicable State and local law;
        (3) promotion of technical advances in the art of manufacturing
      these substances and the development of new substances;

      dispensing of controlled substances, and the existence in the
      establishment of effective controls against diversion; and
        (6) such other factors as may be relevant to and consistent
      with the public health and safety.

        (3) prior conviction record of applicant under Federal or State
      laws relating to the manufacture, distribution, or dispensing of
      such substances;
        (4) past experience in the distribution of controlled
      substances; and
        (5) such other factors as may be relevant to and consistent
      with the public health and safety.
    (f) Research by practitioners; pharmacies; research applications;
      construction of Article 7 of the Convention on Psychotropic
      Substances
      The Attorney General shall register practitioners (including
    pharmacies, as distinguished from pharmacists) to dispense, or
    conduct research with, controlled substances in schedule II, III,
    IV, or V, if the applicant is authorized to dispense, or conduct
    research with respect to, controlled substances under the laws of
    the State in which he practices. The Attorney General may deny an
    application for such registration if he determines that the
    issuance of such registration would be inconsistent with the public
    interest. In determining the public interest, the following factors
    shall be considered:
        (1) The recommendation of the appropriate State licensing board
      or professional disciplinary authority.
        (2) The applicant's experience in dispensing, or conducting
      research with respect to controlled substances.
        (3) The applicant's conviction record under Federal or State
      laws relating to the manufacture, distribution, or dispensing of
      controlled substances.
        (4) Compliance with applicable State, Federal, or local laws
      relating to controlled substances.
        (5) Such other conduct which may threaten the public health and
      safety.

    Separate registration under this part for practitioners engaging in
    research with controlled substances in schedule II, III, IV, or V,
    who are already registered under this part in another capacity,
    shall not be required. Registration applications by practitioners
    wishing to conduct research with controlled substances in schedule
    I shall be referred to the Secretary, who shall determine the
    qualifications and competency of each practitioner requesting
    registration, as well as the merits of the research protocol. The
    Secretary, in determining the merits of each research protocol,
    shall consult with the Attorney General as to effective procedures
    to adequately safeguard against diversion of such controlled
    substances from legitimate medical or scientific use. Registration
    for the purpose of bona fide research with controlled substances in
    schedule I by a practitioner deemed qualified by the Secretary may
    be denied by the Attorney General only on a ground specified in
    section 824(a) of this title. Article 7 of the Convention on
    Psychotropic Substances shall not be construed to prohibit, or
    impose additional restrictions upon, research involving drugs or
    other substances scheduled under the convention which is conducted
    in conformity with this subsection and other applicable provisions
    of this subchapter.
    (g) Practitioners dispensing narcotic drugs for narcotic treatment;
      annual registration; separate registration; qualifications;
      waiver
      (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), practitioners who
    dispense narcotic drugs to individuals for maintenance treatment or
    detoxification treatment shall obtain annually a separate
    registration for that purpose. The Attorney General shall register
    an applicant to dispense narcotic drugs to individuals for
    maintenance treatment or detoxification treatment (or both)
        (A) if the applicant is a practitioner who is determined by the
      Secretary to be qualified (under standards established by the
      Secretary) to engage in the treatment with respect to which
      registration is sought;
        (B) if the Attorney General determines that the applicant will
      comply with standards established by the Attorney General
      respecting (i) security of stocks of narcotic drugs for such
      treatment, and (ii) the maintenance of records (in accordance
      with section 827 of this title) on such drugs; and
        (C) if the Secretary determines that the applicant will comply
      with standards established by the Secretary (after consultation
      with the Attorney General) respecting the quantities of narcotic
      drugs which may be provided for unsupervised use by individuals
      in such treatment.

      (2)(A) Subject to subparagraphs (D) and (J), the requirements of
    paragraph (1) are waived in the case of the dispensing (including
    the prescribing), by a practitioner, of narcotic drugs in schedule
    III, IV, or V or combinations of such drugs if the practitioner
    meets the conditions specified in subparagraph (B) and the narcotic
    drugs or combinations of such drugs meet the conditions specified
    in subparagraph (C).
      (B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), the conditions specified in
    this subparagraph with respect to a practitioner are that, before
    the initial dispensing of narcotic drugs in schedule III, IV, or V
    or combinations of such drugs to patients for maintenance or
    detoxification treatment, the practitioner submit to the Secretary
    a notification of the intent of the practitioner to begin
    dispensing the drugs or combinations for such purpose, and that the
    notification contain the following certifications by the
    practitioner:
        (i) The practitioner is a qualifying physician (as defined in
      subparagraph (G)).
        (ii) With respect to patients to whom the practitioner will
      provide such drugs or combinations of drugs, the practitioner has
      the capacity to refer the patients for appropriate counseling and
      other appropriate ancillary services.
        (iii) The total number of such patients of the practitioner at
      any one time will not exceed the applicable number. For purposes
      of this clause, the applicable number is 30, unless, not sooner
      than 1 year after the date on which the practitioner submitted
      the initial notification, the practitioner submits a second
      notification to the Secretary of the need and intent of the
      practitioner to treat up to 100 patients. A second notification
      under this clause shall contain the certifications required by
      clauses (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph. The Secretary may by
      regulation change such total number.

      (C) For purposes of subparagraph (A), the conditions specified in
    this subparagraph with respect to narcotic drugs in schedule III,
    IV, or V or combinations of such drugs are as follows:
        (i) The drugs or combinations of drugs have, under the Federal
      Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.] or section
      262 of title 42, been approved for use in maintenance or
      detoxification treatment.
        (ii) The drugs or combinations of drugs have not been the
      subject of an adverse determination. For purposes of this clause,
      an adverse determination is a determination published in the
      Federal Register and made by the Secretary, after consultation
      with the Attorney General, that the use of the drugs or
      combinations of drugs for maintenance or detoxification treatment
      requires additional standards respecting the qualifications of
      practitioners to provide such treatment, or requires standards
      respecting the quantities of the drugs that may be provided for
      unsupervised use.

      (D)(i) A waiver under subparagraph (A) with respect to a
    practitioner is not in effect unless (in addition to conditions
    under subparagraphs (B) and (C)) the following conditions are met:
        (I) The notification under subparagraph (B) is in writing and
      states the name of the practitioner.
        (II) The notification identifies the registration issued for
      the practitioner pursuant to subsection (f) of this section.
        (III) If the practitioner is a member of a group practice, the
      notification states the names of the other practitioners in the
      practice and identifies the registrations issued for the other
      practitioners pursuant to subsection (f) of this section.

      (ii) Upon receiving a notification under subparagraph (B), the
    Attorney General shall assign the practitioner involved an
    identification number under this paragraph for inclusion with the
    registration issued for the practitioner pursuant to subsection (f)
    of this section. The identification number so assigned shall be
    appropriate to preserve the confidentiality of patients for whom
    the practitioner has dispensed narcotic drugs under a waiver under
    subparagraph (A).
      (iii) Not later than 45 days after the date on which the
    Secretary receives a notification under subparagraph (B), the
    Secretary shall make a determination of whether the practitioner
    involved meets all requirements for a waiver under subparagraph
    (B). If the Secretary fails to make such determination by the end
    of the such 45-day period, the Attorney General shall assign the
    physician an identification number described in clause (ii) at the
    end of such period.
      (E)(i) If a practitioner is not registered under paragraph (1)
    and, in violation of the conditions specified in subparagraphs (B)
    through (D), dispenses narcotic drugs in schedule III, IV, or V or
    combinations of such drugs for maintenance treatment or
    detoxification treatment, the Attorney General may, for purposes of
    section 824(a)(4) of this title, consider the practitioner to have
    committed an act that renders the registration of the practitioner
    pursuant to subsection (f) of this section to be inconsistent with
    the public interest.
      (ii)(I) Upon the expiration of 45 days from the date on which the
    Secretary receives a notification under subparagraph (B), a
    practitioner who in good faith submits a notification under
    subparagraph (B) and reasonably believes that the conditions
    specified in subparagraphs (B) through (D) have been met shall, in
    dispensing narcotic drugs in schedule III, IV, or V or combinations
    of such drugs for maintenance treatment or detoxification
    treatment, be considered to have a waiver under subparagraph (A)
    until notified otherwise by the Secretary, except that such a
    practitioner may commence to prescribe or dispense such narcotic
    drugs for such purposes prior to the expiration of such 45-day
    period if it facilitates the treatment of an individual patient and
    both the Secretary and the Attorney General are notified by the
    practitioner of the intent to commence prescribing or dispensing
    such narcotic drugs.
      (II) For purposes of subclause (I), the publication in the
    Federal Register of an adverse determination by the Secretary
    pursuant to subparagraph (C)(ii) shall (with respect to the
    narcotic drug or combination involved) be considered to be a
    notification provided by the Secretary to practitioners, effective
    upon the expiration of the 30-day period beginning on the date on
    which the adverse determination is so published.
      (F)(i) With respect to the dispensing of narcotic drugs in
    schedule III, IV, or V or combinations of such drugs to patients
    for maintenance or detoxification treatment, a practitioner may, in
    his or her discretion, dispense such drugs or combinations for such
    treatment under a registration under paragraph (1) or a waiver
    under subparagraph (A) (subject to meeting the applicable
    conditions).
      (ii) This paragraph may not be construed as having any legal
    effect on the conditions for obtaining a registration under
    paragraph (1), including with respect to the number of patients who
    may be served under such a registration.
      (G) For purposes of this paragraph:
        (i) The term "group practice" has the meaning given such term
      in section 1395nn(h)(4) of title 42.
        (ii) The term "qualifying physician" means a physician who is
      licensed under State law and who meets one or more of the
      following conditions:
          (I) The physician holds a subspecialty board certification in
        addiction psychiatry from the American Board of Medical
        Specialties.
          (II) The physician holds an addiction certification from the
        American Society of Addiction Medicine.
          (III) The physician holds a subspecialty board certification
        in addiction medicine from the American Osteopathic
        Association.
          (IV) The physician has, with respect to the treatment and
        management of opiate-dependent patients, completed not less
        than eight hours of training (through classroom situations,
        seminars at professional society meetings, electronic
        communications, or otherwise) that is provided by the American
        Society of Addiction Medicine, the American Academy of
        Addiction Psychiatry, the American Medical Association, the
        American Osteopathic Association, the American Psychiatric
        Association, or any other organization that the Secretary
        determines is appropriate for purposes of this subclause.
          (V) The physician has participated as an investigator in one
        or more clinical trials leading to the approval of a narcotic
        drug in schedule III, IV, or V for maintenance or
        detoxification treatment, as demonstrated by a statement
        submitted to the Secretary by the sponsor of such approved
        drug.
          (VI) The physician has such other training or experience as
        the State medical licensing board (of the State in which the
        physician will provide maintenance or detoxification treatment)
        considers to demonstrate the ability of the physician to treat
        and manage opiate-dependent patients.
          (VII) The physician has such other training or experience as
        the Secretary considers to demonstrate the ability of the
        physician to treat and manage opiate-dependent patients. Any
        criteria of the Secretary under this subclause shall be
        established by regulation. Any such criteria are effective only
        for 3 years after the date on which the criteria are
        promulgated, but may be extended for such additional discrete 3-
        year periods as the Secretary considers appropriate for
        purposes of this subclause. Such an extension of criteria may
        only be effectuated through a statement published in the
        Federal Register by the Secretary during the 30-day period
        preceding the end of the 3-year period involved.

      (H)(i) In consultation with the Administrator of the Drug
    Enforcement Administration, the Administrator of the Substance
    Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the Director of
    the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and the Commissioner of Food
    and Drugs, the Secretary shall issue regulations (through notice
    and comment rulemaking) or issue practice guidelines to address the
    following:
        (I) Approval of additional credentialing bodies and the
      responsibilities of additional credentialing bodies.
        (II) Additional exemptions from the requirements of this
      paragraph and any regulations under this paragraph.

    Nothing in such regulations or practice guidelines may authorize
    any Federal official or employee to exercise supervision or control
    over the practice of medicine or the manner in which medical
    services are provided.
      (ii) Not later than 120 days after October 17, 2000, the
    Secretary shall issue a treatment improvement protocol containing
    best practice guidelines for the treatment and maintenance of
    opiate-dependent patients. The Secretary shall develop the protocol
    in consultation with the Director of the National Institute on Drug
    Abuse, the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration,
    the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, the Administrator of the
    Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and other
    substance abuse disorder professionals. The protocol shall be
    guided by science.
      (I) During the 3-year period beginning on the date of approval by
    the Food and Drug Administration of a drug in schedule III, IV, or
    V, a State may not preclude a practitioner from dispensing or
    prescribing such drug, or combination of such drugs, to patients
    for maintenance or detoxification treatment in accordance with this
    paragraph unless, before the expiration of that 3-year period, the
    State enacts a law prohibiting a practitioner from dispensing such
    drugs or combinations of drug.(!1)

      (J)(i) This paragraph takes effect the date referred to in
    subparagraph (I), and remains in effect thereafter.
      (ii) For purposes relating to clause (iii), the Secretary and the
    Attorney General may, during the 3-year period beginning on
    December 29, 2006, make determinations in accordance with the
    following:
        (I) The Secretary may make a determination of whether
      treatments provided under waivers under subparagraph (A) have
      been effective forms of maintenance treatment and detoxification
      treatment in clinical settings; may make a determination of
      whether such waivers have significantly increased (relative to
      the beginning of such period) the availability of maintenance
      treatment and detoxification treatment; and may make a
      determination of whether such waivers have adverse consequences
      for the public health.
        (II) The Attorney General may make a determination of the
      extent to which there have been violations of the numerical
      limitations established under subparagraph (B) for the number of
      individuals to whom a practitioner may provide treatment; may
      make a determination of whether waivers under subparagraph (A)
      have increased (relative to the beginning of such period) the
      extent to which narcotic drugs in schedule III, IV, or V or
      combinations of such drugs are being dispensed or possessed in
      violation of this chapter; and may make a determination of
      whether such waivers have adverse consequences for the public
      health.

      (iii) If, before the expiration of the period specified in clause
    (ii), the Secretary or the Attorney General publishes in the
    Federal Register a decision, made on the basis of determinations
    under such clause, that subparagraph (B)(iii) should be applied by
    limiting the total number of patients a practitioner may treat to
    30, then the provisions in such subparagraph (B)(iii) permitting
    more than 30 patients shall not apply, effective 60 days after the
    date on which the decision is so published. The Secretary shall in
    making any such decision consult with the Attorney General, and
    shall in publishing the decision in the Federal Register include
    any comments received from the Attorney General for inclusion in
    the publication. The Attorney General shall in making any such
    decision consult with the Secretary, and shall in publishing the
    decision in the Federal Register include any comments received from
    the Secretary for inclusion in the publication.
    (h) Applicants for distribution of list I chemicals
      The Attorney General shall register an applicant to distribute a
    list I chemical unless the Attorney General determines that
    registration of the applicant is inconsistent with the public
    interest. Registration under this subsection shall not be required
    for the distribution of a drug product that is exempted under
    clause (iv) or (v) of section 802(39)(A) of this title. In
    determining the public interest for the purposes of this
    subsection, the Attorney General shall consider - 
        (1) maintenance by the applicant of effective controls against
      diversion of listed chemicals into other than legitimate
      channels;
        (2) compliance by the applicant with applicable Federal, State,
      and local law;
        (3) any prior conviction record of the applicant under Federal
      or State laws relating to controlled substances or to chemicals
      controlled under Federal or State law;
        (4) any past experience of the applicant in the manufacture and
      distribution of chemicals; and
        (5) such other factors as are relevant to and consistent with
      the public health and safety.

    Sec. 824. Denial, revocation, or suspension of registration

-STATUTE-
    (a) Grounds
      A registration pursuant to section 823 of this title to
    manufacture, distribute, or dispense a controlled substance or a
    list I chemical may be suspended or revoked by the Attorney General
    upon a finding that the registrant - 
        (1) has materially falsified any application filed pursuant to
      or required by this subchapter or subchapter II of this chapter;
        (2) has been convicted of a felony under this subchapter or
      subchapter II of this chapter or any other law of the United
      States, or of any State, relating to any substance defined in
      this subchapter as a controlled substance or a list I chemical;
        (3) has had his State license or registration suspended,
      revoked, or denied by competent State authority and is no longer
      authorized by State law to engage in the manufacturing,
      distribution, or dispensing of controlled substances or list I
      chemicals or has had the suspension, revocation, or denial of his
      registration recommended by competent State authority;
        (4) has committed such acts as would render his registration
      under section 823 of this title inconsistent with the public
      interest as determined under such section; or
        (5) has been excluded (or directed to be excluded) from
      participation in a program pursuant to section 1320a-7(a) of
      title 42.

    A registration pursuant to section 823(g)(1) of this title to
    dispense a narcotic drug for maintenance treatment or
    detoxification treatment may be suspended or revoked by the
    Attorney General upon a finding that the registrant has failed to
    comply with any standard referred to in section 823(g)(1) of this
    title.
    (b) Limits of revocation or suspension
      The Attorney General may limit revocation or suspension of a
    registration to the particular controlled substance or list I
    chemical with respect to which grounds for revocation or suspension
    exist.
    (c) Service of show cause order; proceedings
      Before taking action pursuant to this section, or pursuant to a
    denial of registration under section 823 of this title, the
    Attorney General shall serve upon the applicant or registrant an
    order to show cause why registration should not be denied, revoked,
    or suspended. The order to show cause shall contain a statement of
    the basis thereof and shall call upon the applicant or registrant
    to appear before the Attorney General at a time and place stated in
    the order, but in no event less than thirty days after the date of
    receipt of the order. Proceedings to deny, revoke, or suspend shall
    be conducted pursuant to this section in accordance with subchapter
    II of chapter 5 of title 5. Such proceedings shall be independent
    of, and not in lieu of, criminal prosecutions or other proceedings
    under this subchapter or any other law of the United States.
    (d) Suspension of registration in cases of imminent danger
      The Attorney General may, in his discretion, suspend any
    registration simultaneously with the institution of proceedings
    under this section, in cases where he finds that there is an
    imminent danger to the public health or safety. A failure to comply
    with a standard referred to in section 823(g)(1) of this title may
    be treated under this subsection as grounds for immediate
    suspension of a registration granted under such section. A
    suspension under this subsection shall continue in effect until the
    conclusion of such proceedings, including judicial review thereof,
    unless sooner withdrawn by the Attorney General or dissolved by a
    court of competent jurisdiction.
    (e) Suspension and revocation of quotas
      The suspension or revocation of a registration under this section
    shall operate to suspend or revoke any quota applicable under
    section 826 of this title.
    (f) Disposition of controlled substances or list I chemicals
      In the event the Attorney General suspends or revokes a
    registration granted under section 823 of this title, all
    controlled substances or list I chemicals owned or possessed by the
    registrant pursuant to such registration at the time of suspension
    or the effective date of the revocation order, as the case may be,
    may, in the discretion of the Attorney General, be placed under
    seal. No disposition may be made of any controlled substances or
    list I chemicals under seal until the time for taking an appeal has
    elapsed or until all appeals have been concluded except that a
    court, upon application therefor, may at any time order the sale of
    perishable controlled substances or list I chemicals. Any such
    order shall require the deposit of the proceeds of the sale with
    the court. Upon a revocation order becoming final, all such
    controlled substances or list I chemicals (or proceeds of sale
    deposited in court) shall be forfeited to the United States; and
    the Attorney General shall dispose of such controlled substances or
    list I chemicals in accordance with section 881(e) of this title.
    All right, title, and interest in such controlled substances or
    list I chemicals shall vest in the United States upon a revocation
    order becoming final.
    (g) Seizure or placement under seal of controlled substances or
      list I chemicals
      The Attorney General may, in his discretion, seize or place under
    seal any controlled substances or list I chemicals owned or
    possessed by a registrant whose registration has expired or who has
    ceased to practice or do business in the manner contemplated by his
    registration. Such controlled substances or list I chemicals shall
    be held for the benefit of the registrant, or his successor in
    interest. The Attorney General shall notify a registrant, or his
    successor in interest, who has any controlled substance or list I
    chemical seized or placed under seal of the procedures to be
    followed to secure the return of the controlled substance or list I
    chemical and the conditions under which it will be returned. The
    Attorney General may not dispose of any controlled substance or
    list I chemical seized or placed under seal under this subsection
    until the expiration of one hundred and eighty days from the date
    such substance or chemical was seized or placed under seal.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 826. Production quotas for controlled substances

-STATUTE-
    (a) Establishment of total annual needs
      The Attorney General shall determine the total quantity and
    establish production quotas for each basic class of controlled
    substance in schedules I and II and for ephedrine, pseudoephedrine,
    and phenylpropanolamine to be manufactured each calendar year to
    provide for the estimated medical, scientific, research, and
    industrial needs of the United States, for lawful export
    requirements, and for the establishment and maintenance of reserve
    stocks. Production quotas shall be established in terms of
    quantities of each basic class of controlled substance and not in
    terms of individual pharmaceutical dosage forms prepared from or
    containing such a controlled substance.
    (b) Individual production quotas; revised quotas
      The Attorney General shall limit or reduce individual production
    quotas to the extent necessary to prevent the aggregate of
    individual quotas from exceeding the amount determined necessary
    each year by the Attorney General under subsection (a) of this
    section. The quota of each registered manufacturer for each basic
    class of controlled substance in schedule I or II or for ephedrine,
    pseudoephedrine, or phenylpropanolamine shall be revised in the
    same proportion as the limitation or reduction of the aggregate of
    the quotas. However, if any registrant, before the issuance of a
    limitation or reduction in quota, has manufactured in excess of his
    revised quota, the amount of the excess shall be subtracted from
    his quota for the following year.
    (c) Manufacturing quotas for registered manufacturers
      On or before October 1 of each year, upon application therefor by
    a registered manufacturer, the Attorney General shall fix a
    manufacturing quota for the basic classes of controlled substances
    in schedules I and II and for ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and
    phenylpropanolamine that the manufacturer seeks to produce. The
    quota shall be subject to the provisions of subsections (a) and (b)
    of this section. In fixing such quotas, the Attorney General shall
    determine the manufacturer's estimated disposal, inventory, and
    other requirements for the calendar year; and, in making his
    determination, the Attorney General shall consider the
    manufacturer's current rate of disposal, the trend of the national
    disposal rate during the preceding calendar year, the
    manufacturer's production cycle and inventory position, the
    economic availability of raw materials, yield and stability
    problems, emergencies such as strikes and fires, and other factors.
    (d) Quotas for registrants who have not manufactured controlled
      substance during one or more preceding years
      The Attorney General shall, upon application and subject to the
    provisions of subsections (a) and (b) of this section, fix a quota
    for a basic class of controlled substance in schedule I or II for
    any registrant who has not manufactured that basic class of
    controlled substance or ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or
    phenylpropanolamine during one or more preceding calendar years. In
    fixing such quota, the Attorney General shall take into account the
    registrant's reasonably anticipated requirements for the current
    year; and, in making his determination of such requirements, he
    shall consider such factors specified in subsection (c) of this
    section as may be relevant.
    (e) Quota increases
      At any time during the year any registrant who has applied for or
    received a manufacturing quota for a basic class of controlled
    substance in schedule I or II or for ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or
    phenylpropanolamine may apply for an increase in that quota to meet
    his estimated disposal, inventory, and other requirements during
    the remainder of that year. In passing upon the application the
    Attorney General shall take into consideration any occurrences
    since the filing of the registrant's initial quota application that
    may require an increased manufacturing rate by the registrant
    during the balance of the year. In passing upon the application the
    Attorney General may also take into account the amount, if any, by
    which the determination of the Attorney General under subsection
    (a) of this section exceeds the aggregate of the quotas of all
    registrants under this section.
    (f) Incidental production exception
      Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subchapter, no
    registration or quota may be required for the manufacture of such

-STATUTE-
    (a) Inventory
      Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section - 
        (1) every registrant under this subchapter shall, on May 1,
      1971, or as soon thereafter as such registrant first engages in
      the manufacture, distribution, or dispensing of controlled
      substances, and every second year thereafter, make a complete and
      accurate record of all stocks thereof on hand, except that the
      regulations prescribed under this section shall permit each such
      biennial inventory (following the initial inventory required by
      this paragraph) to be prepared on such registrant's regular
      general physical inventory date (if any) which is nearest to and
      does not vary by more than six months from the biennial date that
      would otherwise apply;
        (2) on the effective date of each regulation of the Attorney
      General controlling a substance that immediately prior to such
      date was not a controlled substance, each registrant under this
      subchapter manufacturing, distributing, or dispensing such
      substance shall make a complete and accurate record of all stocks
      thereof on hand; and
        (3) on and after May 1, 1971, every registrant under this
      subchapter manufacturing, distributing, or dispensing a
      controlled substance or substances shall maintain, on a current
      basis, a complete and accurate record of each such substance
      manufactured, received, sold, delivered, or otherwise disposed of
      by him, except that this paragraph shall not require the
      maintenance of a perpetual inventory.
    (b) Availability of records
      Every inventory or other record required under this section (1)
    shall be in accordance with, and contain such relevant information
    as may be required by, regulations of the Attorney General, (2)
    shall (A) be maintained separately from all other records of the
    registrant, or (B) alternatively, in the case of nonnarcotic
    controlled substances, be in such form that information required by
    the Attorney General is readily retrievable from the ordinary
    business records of the registrant, and (3) shall be kept and be
    available, for at least two years, for inspection and copying by
    officers or employees of the United States authorized by the
    Attorney General.
    (c) Nonapplicability
      The foregoing provisions of this section shall not apply - 
        (1)(A) to the prescribing of controlled substances in schedule
      II, III, IV, or V by practitioners acting in the lawful course of
      their professional practice unless such substance is prescribed
      in the course of maintenance or detoxification treatment of an
      individual; or
        (B) to the administering of a controlled substance in schedule
      II, III, IV, or V unless the practitioner regularly engages in
      the dispensing or administering of controlled substances and
      charges his patients, either separately or together with charges
      for other professional services, for substances so dispensed or
      administered or unless such substance is administered in the
      course of maintenance treatment or detoxification treatment of an
      individual;
        (2)(A) to the use of controlled substances, at establishments
      registered under this subchapter which keep records with respect
      to such substances, in research conducted in conformity with an
      exemption granted under section 355(i) or 360b(j) of this title;
        (B) to the use of controlled substances, at establishments
      registered under this subchapter which keep records with respect
      to such substances, in preclinical research or in teaching; or
        (3) to the extent of any exemption granted to any person, with
      respect to all or part of such provisions, by the Attorney
      General by or pursuant to regulation on the basis of a finding
      that the application of such provisions (or part thereof) to such
      person is not necessary for carrying out the purposes of this
      subchapter.

    Nothing in the Convention on Psychotropic Substances shall be
    construed as superseding or otherwise affecting the provisions of
    paragraph (1)(B), (2), or (3) of this subsection.
    (d) Periodic reports to Attorney General
      Every manufacturer registered under section 823 of this title
    shall, at such time or times and in such form as the Attorney
    General may require, make periodic reports to the Attorney General
    of every sale, delivery or other disposal by him of any controlled
    substance, and each distributor shall make such reports with
    respect to narcotic controlled substances, identifying by the
    registration number assigned under this subchapter the person or
    establishment (unless exempt from registration under section 822(d)
    of this title) to whom such sale, delivery, or other disposal was
    made.
    (e) Reporting and recordkeeping requirements of drug conventions
      In addition to the reporting and recordkeeping requirements under
    any other provision of this subchapter, each manufacturer
    registered under section 823 of this title shall, with respect to
    narcotic and nonnarcotic controlled substances manufactured by it,
    make such reports to the Attorney General, and maintain such
    records, as the Attorney General may require to enable the United
    States to meet its obligations under articles 19 and 20 of the
    Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs and article 16 of the
    Convention on Psychotropic Substances. The Attorney General shall
    administer the requirements of this subsection in such a manner as
    to avoid the unnecessary imposition of duplicative requirements
    under this subchapter on manufacturers subject to the requirements
    of this subsection.
    (f) Investigational uses of drugs; procedures
      Regulations under sections 355(i) and 360(j) of this title,
    relating to investigational use of drugs, shall include such
    procedures as the Secretary, after consultation with the Attorney
    General, determines are necessary to insure the security and
    accountability of controlled substances used in research to which
    such regulations apply.
    (g) Change of address
      Every registrant under this subchapter shall be required to
    report any change of professional or business address in such
    manner as the Attorney General shall by regulation require.
    (h) Reporting requirements for GHB
      In the case of a drug product containing gamma hydroxybutyric
    acid for which an application has been approved under section 355
    of this title, the Attorney General may, in addition to any other
    requirements that apply under this section with respect to such a
    drug product, establish any of the following as reporting
    requirements:
        (1) That every person who is registered as a manufacturer of
      bulk or dosage form, as a packager, repackager, labeler,
      relabeler, or distributor shall report acquisition and
      distribution transactions quarterly, not later than the 15th day
      of the month succeeding the quarter for which the report is
      submitted, and annually report end-of-year inventories.
        (2) That all annual inventory reports shall be filed no later
      than January 15 of the year following that for which the report
      is submitted and include data on the stocks of the drug product,
      drug substance, bulk drug, and dosage forms on hand as of the
      close of business December 31, indicating whether materials
      reported are in storage or in process of manufacturing.
        (3) That every person who is registered as a manufacturer of
      bulk or dosage form shall report all manufacturing transactions
      both inventory increases, including purchases, transfers, and
      returns, and reductions from inventory, including sales,
      transfers, theft, destruction, and seizure, and shall provide
      data on material manufactured, manufactured from other material,
      use in manufacturing other material, and use in manufacturing
      dosage forms.
        (4) That all reports under this section must include the
      registered person's registration number as well as the
      registration numbers, names, and other identifying information of
      vendors, suppliers, and customers, sufficient to allow the
      Attorney General to track the receipt and distribution of the
      drug.
        (5) That each dispensing practitioner shall maintain for each
      prescription the name of the prescribing practitioner, the
      prescribing practitioner's Federal and State registration
      numbers, with the expiration dates of these registrations,
      verification that the prescribing practitioner possesses the
      appropriate registration to prescribe this controlled substance,
      the patient's name and address, the name of the patient's
      insurance provider and documentation by a medical practitioner
      licensed and registered to prescribe the drug of the patient's
      medical need for the drug. Such information shall be available
      for inspection and copying by the Attorney General.
        (6) That section 830(b)(3) of this title (relating to mail
      order reporting) applies with respect to gamma hydroxybutyric
      acid to the same extent and in the same manner as such section
      applies with respect to the chemicals and drug products specified
      in subparagraph (A)(i) of such section.

      section.
    (c) Preservation and availability

    (a) Schedule II substances
      Except when dispensed directly by a practitioner, other than a
    pharmacist, to an ultimate user, no controlled substance in
    schedule II, which is a prescription drug as determined under the
    Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.], may
    be dispensed without the written prescription of a practitioner,
    except that in emergency situations, as prescribed by the Secretary
    by regulation after consultation with the Attorney General, such
    drug may be dispensed upon oral prescription in accordance with

    and Cosmetic Act [21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.] should be so considered
    because of its abuse potential, he shall so advise the Secretary
    and furnish to him all available data relevant thereto.

    Sec. 830. Regulation of listed chemicals and certain machines

-STATUTE-
    (a) Record of regulated transactions
      (1) Each regulated person who engages in a regulated transaction
    involving a listed chemical, a tableting machine, or an
    encapsulating machine shall keep a record of the transaction for
    two years after the date of the transaction.
      (2) A record under this subsection shall be retrievable and shall
    include the date of the regulated transaction, the identity of each
    party to the regulated transaction, a statement of the quantity and
    form of the listed chemical, a description of the tableting machine
    or encapsulating machine, and a description of the method of
    transfer. Such record shall be available for inspection and copying
    by the Attorney General.
      (3) It is the duty of each regulated person who engages in a
    regulated transaction to identify each other party to the
    transaction. It is the duty of such other party to present proof of
    identity to the regulated person. The Attorney General shall
    specify by regulation the types of documents and other evidence
    that constitute proof of identity for purposes of this paragraph.
    (b) Reports to Attorney General
      (1) Each regulated person shall report to the Attorney General,
    in such form and manner as the Attorney General shall prescribe by
    regulation - 
        (A) any regulated transaction involving an extraordinary
      quantity of a listed chemical, an uncommon method of payment or
      delivery, or any other circumstance that the regulated person
      believes may indicate that the listed chemical will be used in
      violation of this subchapter;
        (B) any proposed regulated transaction with a person whose
      description or other identifying characteristic the Attorney
      General furnishes in advance to the regulated person;
        (C) any unusual or excessive loss or disappearance of a listed
      chemical under the control of the regulated person; and
        (D) any regulated transaction in a tableting machine or an
      encapsulating machine.

    Each report under subparagraph (A) shall be made at the earliest
    practicable opportunity after the regulated person becomes aware of
    the circumstance involved. A regulated person may not complete a
    transaction with a person whose description or identifying
    characteristic is furnished to the regulated person under
    subparagraph (B) unless the transaction is approved by the Attorney
    General. The Attorney General shall make available to regulated
    persons guidance documents describing transactions and
    circumstances for which reports are required under subparagraph (A)
    and subparagraph (C).
      (2) A regulated person that manufactures a listed chemical shall
    report annually to the Attorney General, in such form and manner
    and containing such specific data as the Attorney General shall
    prescribe by regulation, information concerning listed chemicals
    manufactured by the person. The requirement of the preceding
    sentence shall not apply to the manufacture of a drug product that
    is exempted under section 802(39)(A)(iv) of this title.
      (3) Mail order reporting. - (A) As used in this paragraph:
        (i) The term "drug product" means an active ingredient in
      dosage form that has been approved or otherwise may be lawfully
      marketed under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [21 U.S.C. 301 et
      seq.] for distribution in the United States.
        (ii) The term "valid prescription" means a prescription which
      is issued for a legitimate medical purpose by an individual
      practitioner licensed by law to administer and prescribe the
      drugs concerned and acting in the usual course of the
      practitioner's professional practice.

      (B) Each regulated person who engages in a transaction with a
    nonregulated person or who engages in an export transaction which -
    
        (i) involves ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or phenylpropanolamine
      (including drug products containing these chemicals); and
        (ii) uses or attempts to use the Postal Service or any private
      or commercial carrier;

    shall, on a monthly basis, submit a report of each such transaction
    conducted during the previous month to the Attorney General in such
    form, containing such data, and at such times as the Attorney
    General shall establish by regulation.
      (C) The data required for such reports shall include - 
        (i) the name of the purchaser;
        (ii) the quantity and form of the ephedrine, pseudoephedrine,
      or phenylpropanolamine purchased; and
        (iii) the address to which such ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or
      phenylpropanolamine was sent.

      (D) Except as provided in subparagraph (E), the following
    distributions to a nonregulated person, and the following export
    transactions, shall not be subject to the reporting requirement in
    subparagraph (B):
        (i) Distributions of sample packages of drug products when such
      packages contain not more than two solid dosage units or the
      equivalent of two dosage units in liquid form, not to exceed 10
      milliliters of liquid per package, and not more than one package
      is distributed to an individual or residential address in any 30-
      day period.
        (ii) Distributions of drug products by retail distributors that
      may not include face-to-face transactions to the extent that such
      distributions are consistent with the activities authorized for a
      retail distributor as specified in section 802(49) of this title,
      except that this clause does not apply to sales of scheduled
      listed chemical products at retail.
        (iii) Distributions of drug products to a resident of a long
      term care facility (as that term is defined in regulations
      prescribed by the Attorney General) or distributions of drug
      products to a long term care facility for dispensing to or for
      use by a resident of that facility.
        (iv) Distributions of drug products pursuant to a valid
      prescription.
        (v) Exports which have been reported to the Attorney General
      pursuant to section 954 or 971 of this title or which are subject
      to a waiver granted under section 971(f)(2) of this title.
        (vi) Any quantity, method, or type of distribution or any
      quantity, method, or type of distribution of a specific listed
      chemical (including specific formulations or drug products) or of
      a group of listed chemicals (including specific formulations or
      drug products) which the Attorney General has excluded by
      regulation from such reporting requirement on the basis that such
      reporting is not necessary for the enforcement of this subchapter
      or subchapter II of this chapter.

      (E) The Attorney General may revoke any or all of the exemptions
    listed in subparagraph (D) for an individual regulated person if he
    finds that drug products distributed by the regulated person are
    being used in violation of this subchapter or subchapter II of this
    chapter. The regulated person shall be notified of the revocation,
    which will be effective upon receipt by the person of such notice,
    as provided in section 971(c)(1) of this title, and shall have the
    right to an expedited hearing as provided in section 971(c)(2) of
    this title.
    (c) Confidentiality of information obtained by Attorney General;
      non-disclosure; exceptions
      (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), any information obtained
    by the Attorney General under this section which is exempt from
    disclosure under section 552(a) of title 5, by reason of section
    552(b)(4) of such title, is confidential and may not be disclosed
    to any person.
      (2) Information referred to in paragraph (1) may be disclosed
    only - 
        (A) to an officer or employee of the United States engaged in
      carrying out this subchapter, subchapter II of this chapter, or
      the customs laws;
        (B) when relevant in any investigation or proceeding for the
      enforcement of this subchapter, subchapter II of this chapter, or
      the customs laws;
        (C) when necessary to comply with an obligation of the United
      States under a treaty or other international agreement; or
        (D) to a State or local official or employee in conjunction
      with the enforcement of controlled substances laws or chemical
      control laws.

      (3) The Attorney General shall - 
        (A) take such action as may be necessary to prevent
      unauthorized disclosure of information by any person to whom such
      information is disclosed under paragraph (2); and
        (B) issue guidelines that limit, to the maximum extent
      feasible, the disclosure of proprietary business information,
      including the names or identities of United States exporters of
      listed chemicals, to any person to whom such information is
      disclosed under paragraph (2).

      (4) Any person who is aggrieved by a disclosure of information in
    violation of this section may bring a civil action against the
    violator for appropriate relief.
      (5) Notwithstanding paragraph (4), a civil action may not be
    brought under such paragraph against investigative or law
    enforcement personnel of the Drug Enforcement Administration.
    (d) Scheduled listed chemicals; restrictions on sales quantity;
      requirements regarding nonliquid forms
      With respect to ephedrine base, pseudoephedrine base, or
    phenylpropanolamine base in a scheduled listed chemical product - 
        (1) the quantity of such base sold at retail in such a product
      by a regulated seller, or a distributor required to submit
      reports by subsection (b)(3) may not, for any purchaser, exceed a
      daily amount of 3.6 grams, without regard to the number of
      transactions; and
        (2) such a seller or distributor may not sell such a product in
      nonliquid form (including gel caps) at retail unless the product
      is packaged in blister packs, each blister containing not more
      than 2 dosage units, or where the use of blister packs is
      technically infeasible, the product is packaged in unit dose
      packets or pouches.
    (e) Scheduled listed chemicals; behind-the-counter access; logbook
      requirement; training of sales personnel; privacy protections
      (1) Requirements regarding retail transactions
        (A) In general
          Each regulated seller shall ensure that, subject to
        subparagraph (F), sales by such seller of a scheduled listed
        chemical product at retail are made in accordance with the
        following:
            (i) In offering the product for sale, the seller places the
          product such that customers do not have direct access to the
          product before the sale is made (in this paragraph referred
          to as "behind-the-counter" placement). For purposes of this
          paragraph, a behind-the-counter placement of a product
          includes circumstances in which the product is stored in a
          locked cabinet that is located in an area of the facility
          involved to which customers do have direct access.
            (ii) The seller delivers the product directly into the
          custody of the purchaser.
            (iii) The seller maintains, in accordance with criteria
          issued by the Attorney General, a written or electronic list
          of such sales that identifies the products by name, the
          quantity sold, the names and addresses of purchasers, and the
          dates and times of the sales (which list is referred to in
          this subsection as the "logbook"), except that such
          requirement does not apply to any purchase by an individual
          of a single sales package if that package contains not more
          than 60 milligrams of pseudoephedrine.
            (iv) In the case of a sale to which the requirement of
          clause (iii) applies, the seller does not sell such a product
          unless - 
              (I) the prospective purchaser - 
                (aa) presents an identification card that provides a
              photograph and is issued by a State or the Federal
              Government, or a document that, with respect to
              identification, is considered acceptable for purposes of
              sections 274a.2(b)(1)(v)(A) and 274a.2(b)(1)(v)(B) of
              title 8, Code of Federal Regulations (as in effect on or
              after March 9, 2006); and
                (bb) signs the logbook and enters in the logbook his or
              her name, address, and the date and time of the sale; and

              (II) the seller - 
                (aa) determines that the name entered in the logbook
              corresponds to the name provided on such identification
              and that the date and time entered are correct; and
                (bb) enters in the logbook the name of the product and
              the quantity sold.

            (v) The logbook includes, in accordance with criteria of
          the Attorney General, a notice to purchasers that entering
          false statements or misrepresentations in the logbook may
          subject the purchasers to criminal penalties under section
          1001 of title 18, which notice specifies the maximum fine and
          term of imprisonment under such section.
            (vi) The seller maintains each entry in the logbook for not
          fewer than two years after the date on which the entry is
          made.
            (vii) In the case of individuals who are responsible for
          delivering such products into the custody of purchasers or
          who deal directly with purchasers by obtaining payments for
          the products, the seller has submitted to the Attorney
          General a self-certification that all such individuals have,
          in accordance with criteria under subparagraph (B)(ii),
          undergone training provided by the seller to ensure that the
          individuals understand the requirements that apply under this
          subsection and subsection (d).
            (viii) The seller maintains a copy of such certification
          and records demonstrating that individuals referred to in
          clause (vii) have undergone the training.
            (ix) If the seller is a mobile retail vendor:
              (I) The seller complies with clause (i) by placing the
            product in a locked cabinet.
              (II) The seller does not sell more than 7.5 grams of
            ephedrine base, pseudoephedrine base, or
            phenylpropanolamine base in such products per customer
            during a 30-day period.
        (B) Additional provisions regarding certifications and training
          (i) In general
            A regulated seller may not sell any scheduled listed
          chemical product at retail unless the seller has submitted to
          the Attorney General the self-certification referred to in
          subparagraph (A)(vii). The certification is not effective for
          purposes of the preceding sentence unless, in addition to
          provisions regarding the training of individuals referred to
          in such subparagraph, the certification includes a statement
          that the seller understands each of the requirements that
          apply under this paragraph and under subsection (d) and
          agrees to comply with the requirements.
          (ii) Issuance of criteria; self-certification
            The Attorney General shall by regulation establish criteria
          for certifications under this paragraph. The criteria shall -
          
              (I) provide that the certifications are self-
            certifications provided through the program under clause
            (iii);
              (II) provide that a separate certification is required
            for each place of business at which a regulated seller
            sells scheduled listed chemical products at retail; and
              (III) include criteria for training under subparagraph
            (A)(vii).
          (iii) Program for regulated sellers
            The Attorney General shall establish a program regarding
          such certifications and training in accordance with the
          following:
              (I) The program shall be carried out through an Internet
            site of the Department of Justice and such other means as
            the Attorney General determines to be appropriate.
              (II) The program shall inform regulated sellers that
            section 1001 of title 18 applies to such certifications.
              (III) The program shall make available to such sellers an
            explanation of the criteria under clause (ii).
              (IV) The program shall be designed to permit the
            submission of the certifications through such Internet
            site.
              (V) The program shall be designed to automatically
            provide the explanation referred to in subclause (III), and
            an acknowledgement that the Department has received a
            certification, without requiring direct interactions of
            regulated sellers with staff of the Department (other than
            the provision of technical assistance, as appropriate).
          (iv) Availability of certification to State and local
            officials
            Promptly after receiving a certification under subparagraph
          (A)(vii), the Attorney General shall make available a copy of
          the certification to the appropriate State and local
          officials.
        (C) Privacy protections
          In order to protect the privacy of individuals who purchase
        scheduled listed chemical products, the Attorney General shall
        by regulation establish restrictions on disclosure of
        information in logbooks under subparagraph (A)(iii). Such
        regulations shall - 
            (i) provide for the disclosure of the information as
          appropriate to the Attorney General and to State and local
          law enforcement agencies; and
            (ii) prohibit accessing, using, or sharing information in
          the logbooks for any purpose other than to ensure compliance
          with this subchapter or to facilitate a product recall to
          protect public health and safety.
        (D) False statements or misrepresentations by purchasers
          For purposes of section 1001 of title 18, entering
        information in the logbook under subparagraph (A)(iii) shall be
        considered a matter within the jurisdiction of the executive,
        legislative, or judicial branch of the Government of the United
        States.
        (E) Good faith protection
          A regulated seller who in good faith releases information in
        a logbook under subparagraph (A)(iii) to Federal, State, or
        local law enforcement authorities is immune from civil
        liability for such release unless the release constitutes gross
        negligence or intentional, wanton, or willful misconduct.
        (F) Inapplicability of requirements to certain sales
          Subparagraph (A) does not apply to the sale at retail of a
        scheduled listed chemical product if a report on the sales
        transaction is required to be submitted to the Attorney General
        under subsection (b)(3).
        (G) Certain measures regarding theft and diversion
          A regulated seller may take reasonable measures to guard
        against employing individuals who may present a risk with
        respect to the theft and diversion of scheduled listed chemical
        products, which may include, notwithstanding State law, asking
        applicants for employment whether they have been convicted of
        any crime involving or related to such products or controlled
        substances.
      (2) Mail-order reporting; verification of identity of purchaser;
        30-day restriction on quantities for individual purchasers
        Each regulated person who makes a sale at retail of a scheduled
      listed chemical product and is required under subsection (b)(3)
      to submit a report of the sales transaction to the Attorney
      General is subject to the following:
          (A) The person shall, prior to shipping the product, confirm
        the identity of the purchaser in accordance with procedures
        established by the Attorney General. The Attorney General shall
        by regulation establish such procedures.
          (B) The person may not sell more than 7.5 grams of ephedrine
        base, pseudoephedrine base, or phenylpropanolamine base in such
        products per customer during a 30-day period.
      (3) Exemptions for certain products
        Upon the application of a manufacturer of a scheduled listed
      chemical product, the Attorney General may by regulation provide
      that the product is exempt from the provisions of subsection (d)
      and paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection if the Attorney
      General determines that the product cannot be used in the illicit
      manufacture of methamphetamine.

    possession of the United States, then the court in such territory
    or possession having the jurisdiction of a district court of the
    United States in cases arising under the Constitution and laws of
    the United States) shall have jurisdiction in accordance with
    section 1355 of title 28 to enforce this paragraph.
      (B) In the case of a violation of paragraph (5) or (10) of
    subsection (a) of this section, the civil penalty shall not exceed
    $10,000.
      (2)(A) If a violation of this section is prosecuted by an
    information or indictment which alleges that the violation was
    committed knowingly and the trier of fact specifically finds that
    the violation was so committed, such person shall, except as
    otherwise provided in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, be
    sentenced to imprisonment of not more than one year or a fine under
    title 18, or both.
      (B) If a violation referred to in subparagraph (A) was committed
    after one or more prior convictions of the offender for an offense
    punishable under this paragraph (2), or for a crime under any other
    provision of this subchapter or subchapter II of this chapter or
    other law of the United States relating to narcotic drugs,
    marihuana, or depressant or stimulant substances, have become
    final, such person shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of
    not more than 2 years, a fine under title 18, or both.
      (C) In addition to the penalties set forth elsewhere in this
    subchapter or subchapter II of this chapter, any business that
    violates paragraph (11) of subsection (a) of this section shall,
    with respect to the first such violation, be subject to a civil
    penalty of not more than $250,000, but shall not be subject to
    criminal penalties under this section, and shall, for any
    succeeding violation, be subject to a civil fine of not more than
    $250,000 or double the last previously imposed penalty, whichever
    is greater.
      (3) Except under the conditions specified in paragraph (2) of
    this subsection, a violation of this section does not constitute a
    crime, and a judgment for the United States and imposition of a
    civil penalty pursuant to paragraph (1) shall not give rise to any
    disability or legal disadvantage based on conviction for a criminal
    offense.
      (4)(A) If a regulated seller, or a distributor required to submit
    reports under section 830(b)(3) of this title, violates paragraph
    (12) of subsection (a) of this section, or if a regulated seller
    violates paragraph (13) of such subsection, the Attorney General
    may by order prohibit such seller or distributor (as the case may
    be) from selling any scheduled listed chemical product. Any sale of
    such a product in violation of such an order is subject to the same
    penalties as apply under paragraph (2).
      (B) An order under subparagraph (A) may be imposed only through
    the same procedures as apply under section 824(c) of this title for
    an order to show cause.

      relating to controlled substances or listed chemicals,

    has become final, such person shall be sentenced to a term of
    imprisonment of not more than 20 years, a fine under title 18, or
    both.
    (e) Additional penalties
      In addition to any other applicable penalty, any person convicted
    of a felony violation of this section relating to the receipt,
    distribution, manufacture, exportation, or importation of a listed
    chemical may be enjoined from engaging in any transaction involving
    a listed chemical for not more than ten years.

    title.

    district court of the United States for the district in which the
    defendant is located or resides or is doing business.
      (3) Any order or judgment issued by the court pursuant to this
    subsection shall be tailored to restrain violations of this section
    or section 842 of this title.
      (4) The court shall proceed as soon as practicable to the hearing
    and determination of such an action. An action under this
    subsection is governed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
    except that, if an indictment has been returned against the
    respondent, discovery is governed by the Federal Rules of Criminal
    Procedure.

    not less than 90 days but not more than 3 years, and shall be fined
    a minimum of $5,000. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a
    person convicted under this subsection for the possession of a
    mixture or substance which contains cocaine base shall be

    the possession of such a mixture or substance under this subsection
    becomes final and the amount of the mixture or substance exceeds 3

    subsection shall be fined the reasonable costs of the investigation
    and prosecution of the offense, including the costs of prosecution
    of an offense as defined in sections 1918 and 1920 of title 28,
    except that this sentence shall not apply and a fine under this
    section need not be imposed if the court determines under the
    provision of title 18 that the defendant lacks the ability to pay.

    Sec. 844a. Civil penalty for possession of small amounts of certain
      controlled substances

-STATUTE-
    (a) In general
      Any individual who knowingly possesses a controlled substance
    that is listed in section 841(b)(1)(A) of this title in violation
    of section 844 of this title in an amount that, as specified by
    regulation of the Attorney General, is a personal use amount shall
    be liable to the United States for a civil penalty in an amount not
    to exceed $10,000 for each such violation.
    (b) Income and net assets
      The income and net assets of an individual shall not be relevant
    to the determination whether to assess a civil penalty under this
    section or to prosecute the individual criminally. However, in
    determining the amount of a penalty under this section, the income
    and net assets of an individual shall be considered.
    (c) Prior conviction
      A civil penalty may not be assessed under this section if the
    individual previously was convicted of a Federal or State offense
    relating to a controlled substance.
    (d) Limitation on number of assessments
      A civil penalty may not be assessed on an individual under this
    section on more than two separate occasions.
    (e) Assessment
      A civil penalty under this section may be assessed by the
    Attorney General only by an order made on the record after
    opportunity for a hearing in accordance with section 554 of title
    5. The Attorney General shall provide written notice to the
    individual who is the subject of the proposed order informing the
    individual of the opportunity to receive such a hearing with
    respect to the proposed order. The hearing may be held only if the
    individual makes a request for the hearing before the expiration of
    the 30-day period beginning on the date such notice is issued.
    (f) Compromise
      The Attorney General may compromise, modify, or remit, with or
    without conditions, any civil penalty imposed under this section.
    (g) Judicial review
      If the Attorney General issues an order pursuant to subsection
    (e) of this section after a hearing described in such subsection,
    the individual who is the subject of the order may, before the
    expiration of the 30-day period beginning on the date the order is
    issued, bring a civil action in the appropriate district court of
    the United States. In such action, the law and the facts of the
    violation and the assessment of the civil penalty shall be
    determined de novo, and shall include the right of a trial by jury,
    the right to counsel, and the right to confront witnesses. The
    facts of the violation shall be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.
    (h) Civil action
      If an individual does not request a hearing pursuant to
    subsection (e) of this section and the Attorney General issues an
    order pursuant to such subsection, or if an individual does not
    under subsection (g) of this section seek judicial review of such
    an order, the Attorney General may commence a civil action in any
    appropriate district court of the United States for the purpose of
    recovering the amount assessed and an amount representing interest
    at a rate computed in accordance with section 1961 of title 28.
    Such interest shall accrue from the expiration of the 30-day period
    described in subsection (g) of this section. In such an action, the
    decision of the Attorney General to issue the order, and the amount
    of the penalty assessed by the Attorney General, shall not be
    subject to review.
    (i) Limitation
      The Attorney General may not under this subsection (!1) commence
    proceeding against an individual after the expiration of the 5-year
    period beginning on the date on which the individual allegedly
    violated subsection (a) of this section.

    (j) Expungement procedures
      The Attorney General shall dismiss the proceedings under this
    section against an individual upon application of such individual
    at any time after the expiration of 3 years if - 
        (1) the individual has not previously been assessed a civil
      penalty under this section;
        (2) the individual has paid the assessment;
        (3) the individual has complied with any conditions imposed by
      the Attorney General;
        (4) the individual has not been convicted of a Federal or State
      offense relating to a controlled substance; and
        (5) the individual agrees to submit to a drug test, and such
      test shows the individual to be drug free.

    A nonpublic record of a disposition under this subsection shall be
    retained by the Department of Justice solely for the purpose of
    determining in any subsequent proceeding whether the person
    qualified for a civil penalty or expungement under this section. If
    a record is expunged under this subsection, an individual
    concerning whom such an expungement has been made shall not be held
    thereafter under any provision of law to be guilty of perjury,
    false swearing, or making a false statement by reason of his
    failure to recite or acknowledge a proceeding under this section or
    the results thereof in response to an inquiry made of him for any
    purpose.

    of guilty, the United States attorney files an information with the
    court (and serves a copy of such information on the person or
    counsel for the person) stating in writing the previous convictions
    to be relied upon. Upon a showing by the United States attorney
    that facts regarding prior convictions could not with due diligence
    be obtained prior to trial or before entry of a plea of guilty, the
    court may postpone the trial or the taking of the plea of guilty
    for a reasonable period for the purpose of obtaining such facts.
    Clerical mistakes in the information may be amended at any time
    prior to the pronouncement of sentence.
      (2) An information may not be filed under this section if the
    increased punishment which may be imposed is imprisonment for a
    term in excess of three years unless the person either waived or
    was afforded prosecution by indictment for the offense for which
    such increased punishment may be imposed.
    (b) Affirmation or denial of previous conviction
      If the United States attorney files an information under this
    section, the court shall after conviction but before pronouncement
    of sentence inquire of the person with respect to whom the
    information was filed whether he affirms or denies that he has been
    previously convicted as alleged in the information, and shall
    inform him that any challenge to a prior conviction which is not
    made before sentence is imposed may not thereafter be raised to
    attack the sentence.
    (c) Denial; written response; hearing
      (1) If the person denies any allegation of the information of
    prior conviction, or claims that any conviction alleged is invalid,
    he shall file a written response to the information. A copy of the
    response shall be served upon the United States attorney. The court
    shall hold a hearing to determine any issues raised by the response
    which would except the person from increased punishment. The
    failure of the United States attorney to include in the information
    the complete criminal record of the person or any facts in addition
    to the convictions to be relied upon shall not constitute grounds
    for invalidating the notice given in the information required by
    subsection (a)(1) of this section. The hearing shall be before the
    court without a jury and either party may introduce evidence.
    Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection,
    the United States attorney shall have the burden of proof beyond a
    reasonable doubt on any issue of fact. At the request of either
    party, the court shall enter findings of fact and conclusions of
    law.
      (2) A person claiming that a conviction alleged in the
    information was obtained in violation of the Constitution of the
    United States shall set forth his claim, and the factual basis
    therefor, with particularity in his response to the information.
    The person shall have the burden of proof by a preponderance of the
    evidence on any issue of fact raised by the response. Any challenge
    to a prior conviction, not raised by response to the information
    before an increased sentence is imposed in reliance thereon, shall
    be waived unless good cause be shown for failure to make a timely
    challenge.
    (d) Imposition of sentence
      (1) If the person files no response to the information, or if the
    court determines, after hearing, that the person is subject to
    increased punishment by reason of prior convictions, the court
    shall proceed to impose sentence upon him as provided by this part.
      (2) If the court determines that the person has not been
    convicted as alleged in the information, that a conviction alleged
    in the information is invalid, or that the person is otherwise not
    subject to an increased sentence as a matter of law, the court
    shall, at the request of the United States attorney, postpone
    sentence to allow an appeal from that determination. If no such
    request is made, the court shall impose sentence as provided by
    this part. The person may appeal from an order postponing sentence
    as if sentence had been pronounced and a final judgment of
    conviction entered.
    (e) Statute of limitations
      No person who stands convicted of an offense under this part may
    challenge the validity of any prior conviction alleged under this
    section which occurred more than five years before the date of the
    information alleging such prior conviction.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 853. Criminal forfeitures

-STATUTE-
    (a) Property subject to criminal forfeiture
      Any person convicted of a violation of this subchapter or
    subchapter II of this chapter punishable by imprisonment for more
    than one year shall forfeit to the United States, irrespective of
    any provision of State law - 
        (1) any property constituting, or derived from, any proceeds
      the person obtained, directly or indirectly, as the result of
      such violation;
        (2) any of the person's property used, or intended to be used,
      in any manner or part, to commit, or to facilitate the commission
      of, such violation; and
        (3) in the case of a person convicted of engaging in a
      continuing criminal enterprise in violation of section 848 of
      this title, the person shall forfeit, in addition to any property
      described in paragraph (1) or (2), any of his interest in, claims
      against, and property or contractual rights affording a source of
      control over, the continuing criminal enterprise.

    The court, in imposing sentence on such person, shall order, in
    addition to any other sentence imposed pursuant to this subchapter
    or subchapter II of this chapter, that the person forfeit to the
    United States all property described in this subsection. In lieu of
    a fine otherwise authorized by this part, a defendant who derives
    profits or other proceeds from an offense may be fined not more
    than twice the gross profits or other proceeds.
    (b) Meaning of term "property"
      Property subject to criminal forfeiture under this section
    includes - 
        (1) real property, including things growing on, affixed to, and
      found in land; and
        (2) tangible and intangible personal property, including
      rights, privileges, interests, claims, and securities.
    (c) Third party transfers
      All right, title, and interest in property described in
    subsection (a) of this section vests in the United States upon the
    commission of the act giving rise to forfeiture under this section.
    Any such property that is subsequently transferred to a person
    other than the defendant may be the subject of a special verdict of
    forfeiture and thereafter shall be ordered forfeited to the United
    States, unless the transferee establishes in a hearing pursuant to
    subsection (n) of this section that he is a bona fide purchaser for
    value of such property who at the time of purchase was reasonably
    without cause to believe that the property was subject to
    forfeiture under this section.
    (d) Rebuttable presumption
      There is a rebuttable presumption at trial that any property of a
    person convicted of a felony under this subchapter or subchapter II
    of this chapter is subject to forfeiture under this section if the
    United States establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that -
    
        (1) such property was acquired by such person during the period
      of the violation of this subchapter or subchapter II of this
      chapter or within a reasonable time after such period; and
        (2) there was no likely source for such property other than the
      violation of this subchapter or subchapter II of this chapter.
    (e) Protective orders
      (1) Upon application of the United States, the court may enter a
    restraining order or injunction, require the execution of a
    satisfactory performance bond, or take any other action to preserve
    the availability of property described in subsection (a) of this
    section for forfeiture under this section - 
        (A) upon the filing of an indictment or information charging a
      violation of this subchapter or subchapter II of this chapter for
      which criminal forfeiture may be ordered under this section and
      alleging that the property with respect to which the order is
      sought would, in the event of conviction, be subject to
      forfeiture under this section; or
        (B) prior to the filing of such an indictment or information,
      if, after notice to persons appearing to have an interest in the
      property and opportunity for a hearing, the court determines that
      - 
          (i) there is a substantial probability that the United States
        will prevail on the issue of forfeiture and that failure to
        enter the order will result in the property being destroyed,
        removed from the jurisdiction of the court, or otherwise made
        unavailable for forfeiture; and
          (ii) the need to preserve the availability of the property
        through the entry of the requested order outweighs the hardship
        on any party against whom the order is to be entered:

    Provided, however, That an order entered pursuant to subparagraph
    (B) shall be effective for not more than ninety days, unless
    extended by the court for good cause shown or unless an indictment
    or information described in subparagraph (A) has been filed.
      (2) A temporary restraining order under this subsection may be
    entered upon application of the United States without notice or
    opportunity for a hearing when an information or indictment has not
    yet been filed with respect to the property, if the United States
    demonstrates that there is probable cause to believe that the
    property with respect to which the order is sought would, in the
    event of conviction, be subject to forfeiture under this section
    and that provision of notice will jeopardize the availability of
    the property for forfeiture. Such a temporary order shall expire
    not more than ten days after the date on which it is entered,
    unless extended for good cause shown or unless the party against
    whom it is entered consents to an extension for a longer period. A
    hearing requested concerning an order entered under this paragraph
    shall be held at the earliest possible time and prior to the
    expiration of the temporary order.
      (3) The court may receive and consider, at a hearing held
    pursuant to this subsection, evidence and information that would be
    inadmissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence.
      (4) Order to repatriate and deposit. - 
        (A) In general. - Pursuant to its authority to enter a pretrial
      restraining order under this section, the court may order a
      defendant to repatriate any property that may be seized and
      forfeited, and to deposit that property pending trial in the
      registry of the court, or with the United States Marshals Service
      or the Secretary of the Treasury, in an interest-bearing account,
      if appropriate.
        (B) Failure to comply. - Failure to comply with an order under
      this subsection, or an order to repatriate property under
      subsection (p) of this section, shall be punishable as a civil or
      criminal contempt of court, and may also result in an enhancement
      of the sentence of the defendant under the obstruction of justice
      provision of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines.
    (f) Warrant of seizure
      The Government may request the issuance of a warrant authorizing
    the seizure of property subject to forfeiture under this section in
    the same manner as provided for a search warrant. If the court
    determines that there is probable cause to believe that the
    property to be seized would, in the event of conviction, be subject
    to forfeiture and that an order under subsection (e) of this
    section may not be sufficient to assure the availability of the
    property for forfeiture, the court shall issue a warrant
    authorizing the seizure of such property.
    (g) Execution
      Upon entry of an order of forfeiture under this section, the
    court shall authorize the Attorney General to seize all property
    ordered forfeited upon such terms and conditions as the court shall
    deem proper. Following entry of an order declaring the property
    forfeited, the court may, upon application of the United States,
    enter such appropriate restraining orders or injunctions, require
    the execution of satisfactory performance bonds, appoint receivers,
    conservators, appraisers, accountants, or trustees, or take any
    other action to protect the interest of the United States in the
    property ordered forfeited. Any income accruing to or derived from
    property ordered forfeited under this section may be used to offset
    ordinary and necessary expenses to the property which are required
    by law, or which are necessary to protect the interests of the
    United States or third parties.
    (h) Disposition of property
      Following the seizure of property ordered forfeited under this
    section, the Attorney General shall direct the disposition of the
    property by sale or any other commercially feasible means, making
    due provision for the rights of any innocent persons. Any property
    right or interest not exercisable by, or transferable for value to,
    the United States shall expire and shall not revert to the
    defendant, nor shall the defendant or any person acting in concert
    with him or on his behalf be eligible to purchase forfeited
    property at any sale held by the United States. Upon application of
    a person, other than the defendant or a person acting in concert
    with him or on his behalf, the court may restrain or stay the sale
    or disposition of the property pending the conclusion of any appeal
    of the criminal case giving rise to the forfeiture, if the
    applicant demonstrates that proceeding with the sale or disposition
    of the property will result in irreparable injury, harm, or loss to
    him.
    (i) Authority of the Attorney General
      With respect to property ordered forfeited under this section,
    the Attorney General is authorized to - 
        (1) grant petitions for mitigation or remission of forfeiture,
      restore forfeited property to victims of a violation of this
      subchapter, or take any other action to protect the rights of
      innocent persons which is in the interest of justice and which is
      not inconsistent with the provisions of this section;
        (2) compromise claims arising under this section;
        (3) award compensation to persons providing information
      resulting in a forfeiture under this section;
        (4) direct the disposition by the United States, in accordance
      with the provisions of section 881(e) of this title, of all
      property ordered forfeited under this section by public sale or
      any other commercially feasible means, making due provision for
      the rights of innocent persons; and
        (5) take appropriate measures necessary to safeguard and
      maintain property ordered forfeited under this section pending
      its disposition.
    (j) Applicability of civil forfeiture provisions
      Except to the extent that they are inconsistent with the
    provisions of this section, the provisions of section 881(d) of
    this title shall apply to a criminal forfeiture under this section.
    (k) Bar on intervention
      Except as provided in subsection (n) of this section, no party
    claiming an interest in property subject to forfeiture under this
    section may - 
        (1) intervene in a trial or appeal of a criminal case involving
      the forfeiture of such property under this section; or
        (2) commence an action at law or equity against the United
      States concerning the validity of his alleged interest in the
      property subsequent to the filing of an indictment or information
      alleging that the property is subject to forfeiture under this
      section.
    (l) Jurisdiction to enter orders
      The district courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction
    to enter orders as provided in this section without regard to the
    location of any property which may be subject to forfeiture under
    this section or which has been ordered forfeited under this
    section.
    (m) Depositions
      In order to facilitate the identification and location of
    property declared forfeited and to facilitate the disposition of
    petitions for remission or mitigation of forfeiture, after the
    entry of an order declaring property forfeited to the United
    States, the court may, upon application of the United States, order
    that the testimony of any witness relating to the property
    forfeited be taken by deposition and that any designated book,
    paper, document, record, recording, or other material not
    privileged be produced at the same time and place, in the same
    manner as provided for the taking of depositions under Rule 15 of
    the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.
    (n) Third party interests
      (1) Following the entry of an order of forfeiture under this
    section, the United States shall publish notice of the order and of
    its intent to dispose of the property in such manner as the
    Attorney General may direct. The Government may also, to the extent
    practicable, provide direct written notice to any person known to
    have alleged an interest in the property that is the subject of the
    order of forfeiture as a substitute for published notice as to
    those persons so notified.
      (2) Any person, other than the defendant, asserting a legal
    interest in property which has been ordered forfeited to the United
    States pursuant to this section may, within thirty days of the
    final publication of notice or his receipt of notice under
    paragraph (1), whichever is earlier, petition the court for a
    hearing to adjudicate the validity of his alleged interest in the
    property. The hearing shall be held before the court alone, without
    a jury.
      (3) The petition shall be signed by the petitioner under penalty
    of perjury and shall set forth the nature and extent of the
    petitioner's right, title, or interest in the property, the time
    and circumstances of the petitioner's acquisition of the right,
    title, or interest in the property, any additional facts supporting
    the petitioner's claim, and the relief sought.
      (4) The hearing on the petition shall, to the extent practicable
    and consistent with the interests of justice, be held within thirty
    days of the filing of the petition. The court may consolidate the
    hearing on the petition with a hearing on any other petition filed
    by a person other than the defendant under this subsection.
      (5) At the hearing, the petitioner may testify and present
    evidence and witnesses on his own behalf, and cross-examine
    witnesses who appear at the hearing. The United States may present
    evidence and witnesses in rebuttal and in defense of its claim to
    the property and cross-examine witnesses who appear at the hearing.
    In addition to testimony and evidence presented at the hearing, the
    court shall consider the relevant portions of the record of the
    criminal case which resulted in the order of forfeiture.
      (6) If, after the hearing, the court determines that the
    petitioner has established by a preponderance of the evidence that -
     
        (A) the petitioner has a legal right, title, or interest in the
      property, and such right, title, or interest renders the order of
      forfeiture invalid in whole or in part because the right, title,
      or interest was vested in the petitioner rather than the
      defendant or was superior to any right, title, or interest of the
      defendant at the time of the commission of the acts which gave
      rise to the forfeiture of the property under this section; or
        (B) the petitioner is a bona fide purchaser for value of the
      right, title, or interest in the property and was at the time of
      purchase reasonably without cause to believe that the property
      was subject to forfeiture under this section;

    the court shall amend the order of forfeiture in accordance with
    its determination.
      (7) Following the court's disposition of all petitions filed
    under this subsection, or if no such petitions are filed following
    the expiration of the period provided in paragraph (2) for the
    filing of such petitions, the United States shall have clear title
    to property that is the subject of the order of forfeiture and may
    warrant good title to any subsequent purchaser or transferee.
    (o) Construction
      The provisions of this section shall be liberally construed to
    effectuate its remedial purposes.
    (p) Forfeiture of substitute property
      (1) In general
        Paragraph (2) of this subsection shall apply, if any property
      described in subsection (a) of this section, as a result of any
      act or omission of the defendant - 
          (A) cannot be located upon the exercise of due diligence;
          (B) has been transferred or sold to, or deposited with, a
        third party;
          (C) has been placed beyond the jurisdiction of the court;
          (D) has been substantially diminished in value; or
          (E) has been commingled with other property which cannot be
        divided without difficulty.
      (2) Substitute property
        In any case described in any of subparagraphs (A) through (E)
      of paragraph (1), the court shall order the forfeiture of any
      other property of the defendant, up to the value of any property
      described in subparagraphs (A) through (E) of paragraph (1), as
      applicable.
      (3) Return of property to jurisdiction
        In the case of property described in paragraph (1)(C), the
      court may, in addition to any other action authorized by this
      subsection, order the defendant to return the property to the
      jurisdiction of the court so that the property may be seized and
      forfeited.
    (q) Restitution for cleanup of clandestine laboratory sites
      The court, when sentencing a defendant convicted of an offense
    under this subchapter or subchapter II of this chapter involving
    the manufacture, the possession, or the possession with intent to
    distribute, of amphetamine or methamphetamine, shall - 
        (1) order restitution as provided in sections 3612 and 3664 of
      title 18;
        (2) order the defendant to reimburse the United States, the
      State or local government concerned, or both the United States
      and the State or local government concerned for the costs
      incurred by the United States or the State or local government
      concerned, as the case may be, for the cleanup associated with
      the manufacture of amphetamine or methamphetamine by the
      defendant, or on premises or in property that the defendant owns,
      resides, or does business in; and
        (3) order restitution to any person injured as a result of the
      offense as provided in section 3663A of title 18.

    Sec. 862. Denial of Federal benefits to drug traffickers and
      possessors

-STATUTE-
    (a) Drug traffickers
      (1) Any individual who is convicted of any Federal or State
    offense consisting of the distribution of controlled substances
    shall - 
        (A) at the discretion of the court, upon the first conviction
      for such an offense be ineligible for any or all Federal benefits
      for up to 5 years after such conviction;
        (B) at the discretion of the court, upon a second conviction
      for such an offense be ineligible for any or all Federal benefits
      for up to 10 years after such conviction; and
        (C) upon a third or subsequent conviction for such an offense
      be permanently ineligible for all Federal benefits.

      (2) The benefits which are denied under this subsection shall not
    include benefits relating to long-term drug treatment programs for
    addiction for any person who, if there is a reasonable body of
    evidence to substantiate such declaration, declares himself to be
    an addict and submits himself to a long-term treatment program for
    addiction, or is deemed to be rehabilitated pursuant to rules
    established by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.
    (b) Drug possessors
      (1) Any individual who is convicted of any Federal or State
    offense involving the possession of a controlled substance (as such
    term is defined for purposes of this subchapter) shall - 
        (A) upon the first conviction for such an offense and at the
      discretion of the court - 
          (i) be ineligible for any or all Federal benefits for up to
        one year;
          (ii) be required to successfully complete an approved drug
        treatment program which includes periodic testing to insure
        that the individual remains drug free;
          (iii) be required to perform appropriate community service;
        or
          (iv) any combination of clause (i), (ii), or (iii); and

        (B) upon a second or subsequent conviction for such an offense
      be ineligible for all Federal benefits for up to 5 years after
      such conviction as determined by the court. The court shall
      continue to have the discretion in subparagraph (A) above. In
      imposing penalties and conditions under subparagraph (A), the
      court may require that the completion of the conditions imposed
      by clause (ii) or (iii) be a requirement for the reinstatement of
      benefits under clause (i).

      (2) The penalties and conditions which may be imposed under this
    subsection shall be waived in the case of a person who, if there is
    a reasonable body of evidence to substantiate such declaration,
    declares himself to be an addict and submits himself to a long-term
    treatment program for addiction, or is deemed to be rehabilitated
    pursuant to rules established by the Secretary of Health and Human
    Services.
    (c) Suspension of period of ineligibility
      The period of ineligibility referred to in subsections (a) and
    (b) of this section shall be suspended if the individual - 
        (A) completes a supervised drug rehabilitation program after
      becoming ineligible under this section;
        (B) has otherwise been rehabilitated; or
        (C) has made a good faith effort to gain admission to a
      supervised drug rehabilitation program, but is unable to do so
      because of inaccessibility or unavailability of such a program,
      or the inability of the individual to pay for such a program.
    (d) Definitions

        United States; and
          (B) does not include any retirement, welfare, Social
        Security, health, disability, veterans benefit, public housing,

-HEAD-
    Sec. 876. Subpenas

-STATUTE-
    (a) Authorization of use by Attorney General
      In any investigation relating to his functions under this
    subchapter with respect to controlled substances, listed chemicals,
    tableting machines, or encapsulating machines, the Attorney General
    may subpena witnesses, compel the attendance and testimony of
    witnesses, and require the production of any records (including
    books, papers, documents, and other tangible things which
    constitute or contain evidence) which the Attorney General finds
    relevant or material to the investigation. The attendance of
    witnesses and the production of records may be required from any
    place in any State or in any territory or other place subject to
    the jurisdiction of the United States at any designated place of
    hearing; except that a witness shall not be required to appear at
    any hearing more than 500 miles distant from the place where he was
    served with a subpena. Witnesses summoned under this section shall
    be paid the same fees and mileage that are paid witnesses in the
    courts of the United States.
    (b) Service
      A subpena issued under this section may be served by any person
    designated in the subpena to serve it. Service upon a natural
    person may be made by personal delivery of the subpena to him.
    Service may be made upon a domestic or foreign corporation or upon
    a partnership or other unincorporated association which is subject
    to suit under a common name, by delivering the subpena to an
    officer, to a managing or general agent, or to any other agent
    authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of process.
    The affidavit of the person serving the subpena entered on a true
    copy thereof by the person serving it shall be proof of service.
    (c) Enforcement
      In the case of contumacy by or refusal to obey a subpena issued
    to any person, the Attorney General may invoke the aid of any court
    of the United States within the jurisdiction of which the
    investigation is carried on or of which the subpenaed person is an
    inhabitant, or in which he carries on business or may be found, to
    compel compliance with the subpena. The court may issue an order
    requiring the subpenaed person to appear before the Attorney
    General to produce records, if so ordered, or to give testimony
    touching the matter under investigation. Any failure to obey the
    order of the court may be punished by the court as a contempt
    thereof. All process in any such case may be served in any judicial
    district in which such person may be found.

    Sec. 880. Administrative inspections and warrants

-STATUTE-
    (a) "Controlled premises" defined
      As used in this section, the term "controlled premises" means - 
        (1) places where original or other records or documents
      required under this subchapter are kept or required to be kept,
      and
        (2) places, including factories, warehouses, and other
      establishments, and conveyances, where persons registered under
      section 823 of this title (or exempt from registration under
      section 822(d) of this title or by regulation of the Attorney
      General) or regulated persons may lawfully hold, manufacture,
      distribute, dispense, administer, or otherwise dispose of
      controlled substances or listed chemicals or where records
      relating to those activities are maintained.
    (b) Grant of authority; scope of inspections
      (1) For the purpose of inspecting, copying, and verifying the
    correctness of records, reports, or other documents required to be
    kept or made under this subchapter and otherwise facilitating the
    carrying out of his functions under this subchapter, the Attorney
    General is authorized, in accordance with this section, to enter
    controlled premises and to conduct administrative inspections
    thereof, and of the things specified in this section, relevant to
    those functions.
      (2) Such entries and inspections shall be carried out through
    officers or employees (hereinafter referred to as "inspectors")
    designated by the Attorney General. Any such inspector, upon
    stating his purpose and presenting to the owner, operator, or agent
    in charge of such premises (A) appropriate credentials and (B) a
    written notice of his inspection authority (which notice in the
    case of an inspection requiring, or in fact supported by, an
    administrative inspection warrant shall consist of such warrant),
    shall have the right to enter such premises and conduct such
    inspection at reasonable times.
      (3) Except as may otherwise be indicated in an applicable
    inspection warrant, the inspector shall have the right - 
        (A) to inspect and copy records, reports, and other documents
      required to be kept or made under this subchapter;
        (B) to inspect, within reasonable limits and in a reasonable
      manner, controlled premises and all pertinent equipment, finished
      and unfinished drugs, listed chemicals, and other substances or
      materials, containers, and labeling found therein, and, except as
      provided in paragraph (4) of this subsection, all other things
      therein (including records, files, papers, processes, controls,
      and facilities) appropriate for verification of the records,
      reports, and documents referred to in clause (A) or otherwise
      bearing on the provisions of this subchapter; and
        (C) to inventory any stock of any controlled substance or
      listed chemical therein and obtain samples of any such substance
      or chemical.

      (4) Except when the owner, operator, or agent in charge of the
    controlled premises so consents in writing, no inspection
    authorized by this section shall extend to - 
        (A) financial data;
        (B) sales data other than shipment data; or
        (C) pricing data.
    (c) Situations not requiring warrants
      A warrant under this section shall not be required for the
    inspection of books and records pursuant to an administrative
    subpena issued in accordance with section 876 of this title, nor
    for entries and administrative inspections (including seizures of
    property) - 
        (1) with the consent of the owner, operator, or agent in charge
      of the controlled premises;
        (2) in situations presenting imminent danger to health or
      safety;
        (3) in situations involving inspection of conveyances where
      there is reasonable cause to believe that the mobility of the
      conveyance makes it impracticable to obtain a warrant;
        (4) in any other exceptional or emergency circumstance where
      time or opportunity to apply for a warrant is lacking; or
        (5) in any other situations where a warrant is not
      constitutionally required.
    (d) Administrative inspection warrants; issuance; execution;
      probable cause
      Issuance and execution of administrative inspection warrants
    shall be as follows:
        (1) Any judge of the United States or of a State court of
      record, or any United States magistrate judge, may, within his
      territorial jurisdiction, and upon proper oath or affirmation
      showing probable cause, issue warrants for the purpose of
      conducting administrative inspections authorized by this
      subchapter or regulations thereunder, and seizures of property
      appropriate to such inspections. For the purposes of this
      section, the term "probable cause" means a valid public interest
      in the effective enforcement of this subchapter or regulations
      thereunder sufficient to justify administrative inspections of
      the area, premises, building, or conveyance, or contents thereof,
      in the circumstances specified in the application for the
      warrant.
        (2) A warrant shall issue only upon an affidavit of an officer
      or employee having knowledge of the facts alleged, sworn to
      before the judge or magistrate judge and establishing the grounds
      for issuing the warrant. If the judge or magistrate judge is
      satisfied that grounds for the application exist or that there is
      probable cause to believe they exist, he shall issue a warrant
      identifying the area, premises, building, or conveyance to be
      inspected, the purpose of such inspection, and, where
      appropriate, the type of property to be inspected, if any. The
      warrant shall identify the items or types of property to be
      seized, if any. The warrant shall be directed to a person
      authorized under subsection (b)(2) of this section to execute it.
      The warrant shall state the grounds for its issuance and the name
      of the person or persons whose affidavit has been taken in
      support thereof. It shall command the person to whom it is
      directed to inspect the area, premises, building, or conveyance
      identified for the purpose specified, and, where appropriate,
      shall direct the seizure of the property specified. The warrant
      shall direct that it be served during normal business hours. It
      shall designate the judge or magistrate judge to whom it shall be
      returned.
        (3) A warrant issued pursuant to this section must be executed
      and returned within ten days of its date unless, upon a showing
      by the United States of a need therefor, the judge or magistrate
      judge allows additional time in the warrant. If property is
      seized pursuant to a warrant, the person executing the warrant
      shall give to the person from whom or from whose premises the
      property was taken a copy of the warrant and a receipt for the
      property taken or shall leave the copy and receipt at the place
      from which the property was taken. The return of the warrant
      shall be made promptly and shall be accompanied by a written
      inventory of any property taken. The inventory shall be made in
      the presence of the person executing the warrant and of the
      person from whose possession or premises the property was taken,
      if they are present, or in the presence of at least one credible
      person other than the person making such inventory, and shall be
      verified by the person executing the warrant. The judge or
      magistrate judge, upon request, shall deliver a copy of the
      inventory to the person from whom or from whose premises the
      property was taken and the applicant for the warrant.
        (4) The judge or magistrate judge who has issued a warrant
      under this section shall attach to the warrant a copy of the
      return and all papers filed in connection therewith and shall
      file them with the clerk of the district court of the United
      States for the judicial district in which the inspection was
      made.

          (i) has been agreed to by the Secretary of State;
          (ii) is authorized in an international agreement between the
        United States and the foreign country; and
          (iii) is made to a country which, if applicable, has been
        certified under section 2291j(b) of title 22.

      degree of direct participation of the State or local agency in
      the law enforcement effort resulting in the forfeiture, taking
      into account the total value of all property forfeited and the
      total law enforcement effort with respect to the violation of law
      on which the forfeiture is based; and
        (B) will serve to encourage further cooperation between the
      recipient State or local agency and Federal law enforcement

      case within 21 days of seizure, or provide a procedure by which
      the defendant can obtain release of the property pending a final
      determination of the case. Such regulations shall provide that
      the appropriate agency official rendering a final determination
      shall immediately return the property if the following conditions

        any knowledge or reason to believe that the property in which
        the owner claims an interest was being or would be used in a
        violation of the law; and
          "(2) if the owner at any time had, or should have had,
        knowledge or reason to believe that the property in which the
        owner claims an interest was being or would be used in a
        violation of the law, that the owner did what reasonably could
        be expected to prevent the violation.

    manner to ascertain how the property would be used.
      "(c) Notice. - At the time of seizure or upon issuance of a
    summons to appear under subsection (d), the officer making the

    controlled substance. These regulations shall apply when the
    violation is committed on a commercial fishing industry vessel that
    is proceeding to or from a fishing area or intermediate port of
    call, or is actively engaged in fishing operations. The authority
    provided under this section shall not affect existing authority to
    arrest an individual for drug-related offenses or to release that
    individual into the custody of the vessel's master. Upon answering
    a summons to appear, the procedures set forth in subsections (a),
    (b), and (c) of this section shall apply. The jurisdiction of the
    district court for any forfeiture incurred shall not be affected by
    the use of a summons under this section.

    purposes of this section, personal use quantities of a controlled
    substance shall not include sweepings or other evidence of non-

-STATUTE-
    (a) Controlled substances in schedule I or II and narcotic drugs in
      schedule III, IV, or V; exceptions
      It shall be unlawful to import into the customs territory of the
    United States from any place outside thereof (but within the United
    States), or to import into the United States from any place outside
    thereof, any controlled substance in schedule I or II of subchapter
    I of this chapter, or any narcotic drug in schedule III, IV, or V
    of subchapter I of this chapter, or ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or
    phenylpropanolamine, except that - 
        (1) such amounts of crude opium, poppy straw, concentrate of
      poppy straw, and coca leaves, and of ephedrine, pseudoephedrine,
      and phenylpropanolamine, as the Attorney General finds to be
      necessary to provide for medical, scientific, or other legitimate
      purposes, and
        (2) such amounts of any controlled substance in schedule I or
      II or any narcotic drug in schedule III, IV, or V that the
      Attorney General finds to be necessary to provide for the
      medical, scientific, or other legitimate needs of the United
      States - 
          (A) during an emergency in which domestic supplies of such
        substance or drug are found by the Attorney General to be
        inadequate,
          (B) in any case in which the Attorney General finds that
        competition among domestic manufacturers of the controlled
        substance is inadequate and will not be rendered adequate by
        the registration of additional manufacturers under section 823
        of this title, or
          (C) in any case in which the Attorney General finds that such
        controlled substance is in limited quantities exclusively for
        scientific, analytical, or research uses,

    may be so imported under such regulations as the Attorney General
    shall prescribe. No crude opium may be so imported for the purpose
    of manufacturing heroin or smoking opium.
    (b) Nonnarcotic controlled substances in schedule III, IV, or V
      It shall be unlawful to import into the customs territory of the
    United States from any place outside thereof (but within the United
    States), or to import into the United States from  any  place 
    outside  thereof,  any  nonnarcotic controlled substance in
    schedule III, IV, or V, unless such nonnarcotic controlled
    substance - 
        (1) is imported for medical, scientific, or other legitimate
      uses, and
        (2) is imported pursuant to such notification, or declaration,
      or in the case of any nonnarcotic controlled substance in
      schedule III, such import permit, notification, or declaration,
      as the Attorney General may by regulation prescribe, except that
      if a nonnarcotic controlled substance in schedule IV or V is also
      listed in schedule I or II of the Convention on Psychotropic
      Substances it shall be imported pursuant to such import permit
      requirements, prescribed by regulation of the Attorney General,
      as are required by the Convention.
    (c) Coca leaves
      In addition to the amount of coca leaves authorized to be
    imported into the United States under subsection (a) of this
    section, the Attorney General may permit the importation of
    additional amounts of coca leaves. All cocaine and ecgonine (and
    all salts, derivatives, and preparations from which cocaine or
    ecgonine may be synthesized or made) contained in such additional
    amounts of coca leaves imported under this subsection shall be
    destroyed under the supervision of an authorized representative of
    the Attorney General.
    (d) Application for increased importation of ephedrine,
      pseudoephedrine, or phenylpropanolamine
      (1) With respect to a registrant under section 958 of this title
    who is authorized under subsection (a)(1) to import ephedrine,
    pseudoephedrine, or phenylpropanolamine, at any time during the
    year the registrant may apply for an increase in the amount of such
    chemical that the registrant is authorized to import, and the
    Attorney General may approve the application if the Attorney
    General determines that the approval is necessary to provide for

      (2) Notwithstanding any exemption under paragraph (1), a United
    States resident who enters the United States through an

    Sec. 958. Registration requirements

-STATUTE-
    (a) Applicants to import or export controlled substances in
      schedule I or II
      The Attorney General shall register an applicant to import or
    export a controlled substance in schedule I or II if he determines
    that such registration is consistent with the public interest and
    with United States obligations under international treaties,
    conventions, or protocols in effect on May 1, 1971. In determining
    the public interest, the factors enumerated in paragraph (1)
    through (6) of section 823(a) of this title shall be considered.
    (b) Activity limited to specified substances
      Registration granted under this section shall not entitle a
    registrant to import or export controlled substances other than
    specified in the registration.
    (c) Applicants to import controlled substances in schedule III, IV,
      or V or to export controlled substances in schedule III or IV;
      applicants to import or export list I chemicals
      (1) The Attorney General shall register an applicant to import a
    controlled substance in schedule III, IV, or V or to export a
    controlled substance in schedule III or IV, unless he determines
    that the issuance of such registration is inconsistent with the
    public interest. In determining the public interest, the factors
    enumerated in paragraphs (1) through (6) of section 823(d) of this
    title shall be considered.
      (2)(A) The Attorney General shall register an applicant to import
    or export a list I chemical unless the Attorney General determines
    that registration of the applicant is inconsistent with the public
    interest. Registration under this subsection shall not be required
    for the import or export of a drug product that is exempted under
    section 802(39)(A)(iv) of this title.
      (B) In determining the public interest for the purposes of
    subparagraph (A), the Attorney General shall consider the factors
    specified in section 823(h) of this title.
    (d) Denial of application
      (1) The Attorney General may deny an application for registration
    under subsection (a) of this section if he is unable to determine
    that such registration is consistent with the public interest (as
    defined in subsection (a) of this section) and with the United
    States obligations under international treaties, conventions, or
    protocols in effect on May 1, 1971.
      (2) The Attorney General may deny an application for registration
    under subsection (c) of this section, or revoke or suspend a
    registration under subsection (a) or (c) of this section, if he
    determines that such registration is inconsistent with the public
    interest (as defined in subsection (a) or (c) of this section) or
    with the United States obligations under international treaties,
    conventions, or protocols in effect on May 1, 1971.
      (3) The Attorney General may limit the revocation or suspension
    of a registration to the particular controlled substance, or
    substances, or list I chemical or chemicals, with respect to which
    grounds for revocation or suspension exist.
      (4) Before taking action pursuant to this subsection, the
    Attorney General shall serve upon the applicant or registrant an
    order to show cause as to why the registration should not be
    denied, revoked, or suspended. The order to show cause shall
    contain a statement of the basis thereof and shall call upon the
    applicant or registrant to appear before the Attorney General, or
    his designee, at a time and place stated in the order, but in no
    event less than thirty days after the date of receipt of the order.
    Proceedings to deny, revoke, or suspend shall be conducted pursuant
    to this subsection in accordance with subchapter II of chapter 5 of
    title 5. Such proceedings shall be independent of, and not in lieu
    of, criminal prosecutions or other proceedings under this
    subchapter or any other law of the United States.
      (5) The Attorney General may, in his discretion, suspend any
    registration simultaneously with the institution of proceedings
    under this subsection, in cases where he finds that there is an
    imminent danger to the public health and safety. Such suspension
    shall continue in effect until the conclusion of such proceedings,
    including judicial review thereof, unless sooner withdrawn by the
    Attorney General or dissolved by a court of competent jurisdiction.
      (6) In the event that the Attorney General suspends or revokes a
    registration granted under this section, all controlled substances
    or list I chemicals owned or possessed by the registrant pursuant
    to such registration at the time of suspension or the effective
    date of the revocation order, as the case may be, may, in the
    discretion of the Attorney General, be seized or placed under seal.
    No disposition may be made of any controlled substances or list I
    chemicals under seal until the time for taking an appeal has
    elapsed or until all appeals have been concluded, except that a
    court, upon application therefor, may at any time order the sale of
    perishable controlled substances or list I chemicals. Any such
    order shall require the deposit of the proceeds of the sale with
    the court. Upon a revocation order becoming final, all such
    controlled substances or list I chemicals (or proceeds of the sale
    thereof which have been deposited with the court) shall be
    forfeited to the United States; and the Attorney General shall
    dispose of such controlled substances or list I chemicals in
    accordance with section 881(e) of this title.
    (e) Registration period
      No registration shall be issued under this subchapter for a
    period in excess of one year. Unless the regulations of the
    Attorney General otherwise provide, sections 822(f), 825, 827, and
    830 of this title shall apply to persons registered under this
    section to the same extent such sections apply to persons
    registered under section 823 of this title.
    (f) Rules and regulations
      The Attorney General is authorized to promulgate rules and
    regulations and to charge reasonable fees relating to the
    registration and control of importers and exporters of controlled
    substances or listed chemicals.
    (g) Scope of authorized activity
      Persons registered by the Attorney General under this section to
    import or export controlled substances or list I chemicals may
    import or export (and for the purpose of so importing or exporting,
    may possess) such substances to the extent authorized by their
    registration and in conformity with the other provisions of this
    subchapter and subchapter I of this chapter.
    (h) Separate registrations for each principal place of business
      A separate registration shall be required at each principal place
    of business where the applicant imports or exports controlled
    substances or list I chemicals.
    (i) Emergency situations
      Except in emergency situations as described in section
    952(a)(2)(A) of this title, prior to issuing a registration under
    this section to a bulk manufacturer of a controlled substance in
    schedule I or II, and prior to issuing a regulation under section
    952(a) of this title authorizing the importation of such a
    substance, the Attorney General shall give manufacturers holding
    registrations for the bulk manufacture of the substance an
    opportunity for a hearing.

      For the purpose of any investigation which, in the opinion of the
    Secretary of the Treasury, is necessary and proper to the
    enforcement of section 545 of title 18 (relating to smuggling goods
    into the United States) with respect to any controlled substance
    (as defined in section 802 of this title), the Secretary of the
    Treasury may administer oaths and affirmations, subpena witnesses,
    compel their attendance, take evidence, and require the production
    of records (including books, papers, documents and tangible things
    which constitute or contain evidence) relevant or material to the
    investigation. The attendance of witnesses and the production of
    records may be required from any place within the customs territory
    of the United States, except that a witness shall not be required
    to appear at any hearing distant more than 100 miles from the place
    where he was served with subpena. Witnesses summoned by the
    Secretary shall be paid the same fees and mileage that are paid
    witnesses in the courts of the United States. Oaths and
    affirmations may be made at any place subject to the jurisdiction
    of the United States.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 971. Notification, suspension of shipment, and penalties with
      respect to importation and exportation of listed chemicals

-STATUTE-
    (a) Notification prior to transaction
      Each regulated person who imports or exports a listed chemical
    shall notify the Attorney General of the importation or exportation
    not later than 15 days before the transaction is to take place.
    (b) Regular customers or importers
      (1) The Attorney General shall provide by regulation for
    circumstances in which the requirement of subsection (a) of this
    section does not apply to a transaction between a regulated person
    and a regular customer or to a transaction that is an importation
    by a regular importer. At the time of any importation or
    exportation constituting a transaction referred to in the preceding
    sentence, the regulated person shall notify the Attorney General of
    the transaction.
      (2) The regulations under this subsection shall provide that the
    initial notification under subsection (a) of this section with
    respect to a customer of a regulated person or to an importer
    shall, upon the expiration of the 15-day period, qualify the
    customer as a regular customer or the importer as a regular
    importer, unless the Attorney General otherwise notifies the
    regulated person in writing.
    (c) Suspension of importation or exportation; disqualification of
      regular customers or importers; hearing
      (1) The Attorney General may order the suspension of any
    importation or exportation of a listed chemical (other than a
    regulated transaction to which the requirement of subsection (a) of
    this section does not apply by reason of subsection (b) of this
    section) or may disqualify any regular customer or regular importer
    on the ground that the chemical may be diverted to the clandestine
    manufacture of a controlled substance (without regard to the form
    of the chemical that may be diverted, including the diversion of a
    finished drug product to be manufactured from bulk chemicals to be
    transferred). From and after the time when the Attorney General
    provides written notice of the order (including a statement of the
    legal and factual basis for the order) to the regulated person, the
    regulated person may not carry out the transaction.
      (2) Upon written request to the Attorney General, a regulated
    person to whom an order applies under paragraph (1) is entitled to
    an agency hearing on the record in accordance with subchapter II of
    chapter 5 of title 5. The hearing shall be held on an expedited
    basis and not later than 45 days after the request is made, except
    that the hearing may be held at a later time, if so requested by
    the regulated person.
    (d) Information required in notice; updated notice for change in
      circumstances
      (1)(A) Information provided in a notice under subsection (a) or
    (b) shall include the name of the person to whom the importer or
    exporter involved intends to transfer the listed chemical involved,
    and the quantity of such chemical to be transferred.
      (B) In the case of a notice under subsection (b) submitted by a
    regular importer, if the transferee identified in the notice is not
    a regular customer, such importer may not transfer the listed
    chemical until after the expiration of the 15-day period beginning
    on the date on which the notice is submitted to the Attorney
    General.
      (C) After a notice under subsection (a) or (b) is submitted to
    the Attorney General, if circumstances change and the importer or
    exporter will not be transferring the listed chemical to the
    transferee identified in the notice, or will be transferring a
    greater quantity of the chemical than specified in the notice, the
    importer or exporter shall update the notice to identify the most
    recent prospective transferee or the most recent quantity or both
    (as the case may be) and may not transfer the listed chemical until
    after the expiration of the 15-day period beginning on the date on
    which the update is submitted to the Attorney General, except that
    such 15-day restriction does not apply if the prospective
    transferee identified in the update is a regular customer. The
    preceding sentence applies with respect to changing circumstances
    regarding a transferee or quantity identified in an update to the
    same extent and in the same manner as such sentence applies with
    respect to changing circumstances regarding a transferee or
    quantity identified in the original notice under subsection (a) or
    (b).
      (D) In the case of a transfer of a listed chemical that is
    subject to a 15-day restriction under subparagraph (B) or (C), the
    transferee involved shall, upon the expiration of the 15-day
    period, be considered to qualify as a regular customer, unless the
    Attorney General otherwise notifies the importer or exporter
    involved in writing.
      (2) With respect to a transfer of a listed chemical with which a
    notice or update referred to in paragraph (1) is concerned:
        (A) The Attorney General, in accordance with the same
      procedures as apply under subsection (c)(2) - 
          (i) may order the suspension of the transfer of the listed
        chemical by the importer or exporter involved, except for a
        transfer to a regular customer, on the ground that the chemical
        may be diverted to the clandestine manufacture of a controlled
        substance (without regard to the form of the chemical that may
        be diverted, including the diversion of a finished drug product
        to be manufactured from bulk chemicals to be transferred),
        subject to the Attorney General ordering such suspension before
        the expiration of the 15-day period referred to in paragraph
        (1) with respect to the importation or exportation (in any case
        in which such a period applies); and
          (ii) may, for purposes of clause (i) and paragraph (1),
        disqualify a regular customer on such ground.

        (B) From and after the time when the Attorney General provides
      written notice of the order under subparagraph (A) (including a
      statement of the legal and factual basis for the order) to the
      importer or exporter, the importer or exporter may not carry out
      the transfer.

      (3) For purposes of this subsection:
        (A) The terms "importer" and "exporter" mean a regulated person
      who imports or exports a listed chemical, respectively.
        (B) The term "transfer", with respect to a listed chemical,
      includes the sale of the chemical.
        (C) The term "transferee" means a person to whom an importer or
      exporter transfers a listed chemical.
    (e) Broker or trader for international transaction in listed
      chemical
      A person located in the United States who is a broker or trader
    for an international transaction in a listed chemical that is a
    regulated transaction solely because of that person's involvement
    as a broker or trader shall, with respect to that transaction, be
    subject to all of the notification, reporting, recordkeeping, and
    other requirements placed upon exporters of listed chemicals by
    this subchapter and subchapter I of this chapter.
    (f) Application of notification requirement to exports of listed
      chemical; waiver
      (1) The Attorney General may by regulation require that the 15-
    day notification requirement of subsection (a) of this section
    apply to all exports of a listed chemical to a specified country,
    regardless of the status of certain customers in such country as
    regular customers, if the Attorney General finds that such
    notification is necessary to support effective chemical diversion
    control programs or is required by treaty or other international
    agreement to which the United States is a party.
      (2) The Attorney General may by regulation waive the 15-day
    notification requirement for exports of a listed chemical to a
    specified country if the Attorney General determines that such
    notification is not required for effective chemical diversion
    control. If the notification requirement is waived, exporters of
    the listed chemical shall be required to submit to the Attorney
    General reports of individual exportations or periodic reports of
    such exportation of the listed chemical, at such time or times and
    containing such information as the Attorney General shall establish
    by regulation.
      (3) The Attorney General may by regulation waive the 15-day
    notification requirement for the importation of a listed chemical
    if the Attorney General determines that such notification is not
    necessary for effective chemical diversion control. If the
    notification requirement is waived, importers of the listed
    chemical shall be required to submit to the Attorney General
    reports of individual importations or periodic reports of the
    importation of the listed chemical, at such time or times and
    containing such information as the Attorney General shall establish
    by regulation.
    (g) Return declaration
      Within 30 days after a transaction covered by this section is
    completed, the importer or exporter shall send the Attorney General
    a return declaration containing particulars of the transaction,
    including the date, quantity, chemical, container, name of
    transferees, and such other information as the Attorney General may
    specify in regulations. For importers, a single return declaration
    may include the particulars of both the importation and
    distribution. If the importer has not distributed all chemicals
    imported by the end of the initial 30-day period, the importer
    shall file supplemental return declarations no later than 30 days
    from the date of any further distribution, until the distribution
    or other disposition of all chemicals imported pursuant to the
    import notification or any update are accounted for.
    (h) Importation and distribution of ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or
      phenylpropanolamine
      (1) With respect to a regulated person importing ephedrine,
    pseudoephedrine, or phenylpropanolamine (referred to in this
    section as an "importer"), a notice of importation under subsection
    (a) or (b) shall include all information known to the importer on
    the chain of distribution of such chemical from the manufacturer to
    the importer.
      (2) For the purpose of preventing or responding to the diversion
    of ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or phenylpropanolamine for use in
    the illicit production of methamphetamine, the Attorney General
    may, in the case of any person who is a manufacturer or distributor
    of such chemical in the chain of distribution referred to in
    paragraph (1) (which person is referred to in this subsection as a
    "foreign-chain distributor"), request that such distributor provide
    to the Attorney General information known to the distributor on the
    distribution of the chemical, including sales.
      (3) If the Attorney General determines that a foreign-chain
    distributor is refusing to cooperate with the Attorney General in
    obtaining the information referred to in paragraph (2), the
    Attorney General may, in accordance with procedures that apply
    under subsection (c), issue an order prohibiting the importation of
    ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or phenylpropanolamine in any case in
    which such distributor is part of the chain of distribution for
    such chemical. Not later than 60 days prior to issuing the order,
    the Attorney General shall publish in the Federal Register a notice
    of intent to issue the order. During such 60-day period, imports of
    the chemical with respect to such distributor may not be restricted
    under this paragraph.

    TITLE 21 - FOOD AND DRUGS
    CHAPTER 15 - EGG PRODUCTS INSPECTION

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1031. Congressional statement of findings

-STATUTE-
      Eggs and egg products are an important source of the Nation's
    total supply of food, and are used in food in various forms. They
    are consumed throughout the Nation and the major portion thereof
    moves in interstate or foreign commerce. It is essential, in the
    public interest, that the health and welfare of consumers be
    protected by the adoption of measures prescribed herein for
    assuring that eggs and egg products distributed to them and used in
    products consumed by them are wholesome, otherwise not adulterated,
    and properly labeled and packaged. Lack of effective regulation for
    the handling or disposition of unwholesome, otherwise adulterated,
    or improperly labeled or packaged egg products and certain
    qualities of eggs is injurious to the public welfare and destroys
    markets for wholesome, not adulterated, and properly labeled and
    packaged eggs and egg products and results in sundry losses to
    producers and processors, as well as injury to consumers.
    Unwholesome, otherwise adulterated, or improperly labeled or
    packaged products can be sold at lower prices and compete unfairly
    with the wholesome, not adulterated, and properly labeled and
    packaged products, to the detriment of consumers and the public
    generally. It is hereby found that all egg products and the
    qualities of eggs which are regulated under this chapter are either
    in interstate or foreign commerce, or substantially affect such
    commerce, and that regulation by the Secretary of Agriculture and
    the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and cooperation by the
    States and other jurisdictions, as contemplated by this chapter,
    are appropriate to prevent and eliminate burdens upon such
    commerce, to effectively regulate such commerce, and to protect the
    health and welfare of consumers.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1034. Inspection of egg products

-STATUTE-
    (a) Processing operations and establishments subject to coverage;
      rules and regulations
      For the purpose of preventing the entry into or flow or movement
    in commerce of, or the burdening of commerce by, any egg product
    which is capable of use as human food and is misbranded or
    adulterated, the Secretary shall, whenever processing operations
    are being conducted, cause continuous inspection to be made, in
    accordance with the regulations promulgated under this chapter, of
    the processing of egg products, in each plant processing egg
    products for commerce, unless exempted under section 1044 of this
    title. Without restricting the application of the preceding
    sentence to other kinds of establishments within its provisions,
    any food manufacturing establishment, institution, or restaurant
    which uses any eggs that do not meet the requirements of section
    1044(a)(1) of this title in the preparation of any articles for
    human food shall be deemed to be a plant processing egg products,
    with respect to such operations.
    (b) Authority of Secretary to retain, segregate, and reinspect eggs
      and egg products
      The Secretary, at any time, shall cause such retention,
    segregation, and reinspection as he deems necessary of eggs and egg
    products capable of use as human food in each official plant.
    (c) Condemnation of adulterated products; destruction or
      reprocessing; procedure upon appeal from determination of
      adulteration
      Eggs and egg products found to be adulterated at official plants
    shall be condemned and, if no appeal be taken from such
    determination of condemnation, such articles shall be destroyed for
    human food purposes under the supervision of an inspector:
    Provided, That articles which may by reprocessing be made not
    adulterated need not be condemned and destroyed if so reprocessed
    under the supervision of an inspector and thereafter found to be
    not adulterated. If an appeal be taken from such determination, the
    eggs or egg products shall be appropriately marked and segregated
    pending completion of an appeal inspection, which appeal shall be
    at the cost of the appellant if the Secretary determines that the
    appeal is frivolous. If the determination of condemnation is
    sustained, the eggs or egg products shall be destroyed for human
    food purposes under the supervision of an inspector.
    (d) Inspection of business premises, facilities, inventory,
      operations, and records of egg handlers; inspection of records
      and inventory of others required to keep records; authority of
      Secretary of Health and Human Services to inspect food
      manufacturing establishments, institutions, and restaurants;
      access to places of business
      The Secretary shall cause such other inspections to be made of
    the business premises, facilities, inventory, operations, and
    records of egg handlers, and the records and inventory of other
    persons required to keep records under section 1040 of this title,
    as he deems appropriate (and in the case of shell egg packers,
    packing eggs for the ultimate consumer, at least once each calendar
    quarter) to assure that only eggs fit for human food are used for
    such purpose, and otherwise to assure compliance by egg handlers
    and other persons with the requirements of section 1037 of this
    title, except that the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall
    cause such inspections to be made as he deems appropriate to assure
    compliance with such requirements at food manufacturing
    establishments, institutions, and restaurants, other than plants
    processing egg products. Representatives of said Secretaries shall
    be afforded access to all such places of business for purposes of
    making the inspections provided for in this chapter.
    (e) Refrigeration and labeling requirements
      (1) Subject to paragraphs (2), (3), and (4), the Secretary shall
    make such inspections as the Secretary considers appropriate of a
    facility of an egg handler (including a transport vehicle) to
    determine if shell eggs destined for the ultimate consumer - 
        (A) are being held under refrigeration at an ambient
      temperature of no greater than 45 degrees Fahrenheit after
      packing; and
        (B) contain labeling that indicates that refrigeration is
      required.

      (2) In the case of a shell egg packer packing eggs for the
    ultimate consumer, the Secretary shall make an inspection in
    accordance with paragraph (1) at least once each calendar quarter.
      (3) The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall cause such
    inspections to be made as the Secretary considers appropriate to
    ensure compliance with the requirements of paragraph (1) at food
    manufacturing establishments, institutions, and restaurants, other
    than plants packing eggs.
      (4) The Secretary shall not make an inspection as provided in
    paragraph (1) on any egg handler with a flock of not more than
    3,000 layers.
      (5) A representative of the Secretary and the Secretary of Health
    and Human Services shall be afforded access to a place of business
    referred to in this subsection, including a transport vehicle, for
    purposes of making an inspection required under this subsection.

    Sec. 1036. Pasteurization and labeling of egg products at official
      plants

-STATUTE-
    (a) Contents of label
      Egg products inspected at any official plant under the authority
    of this chapter and found to be not adulterated shall be
    pasteurized before they leave the official plant, except as
    otherwise permitted by regulations of the Secretary, and shall at
    the time they leave the official plant, bear in distinctly legible
    form on their shipping containers or immediate containers, or both,
    when required by regulations of the Secretary, the official
    inspection legend and official plant number, of the plant where the
    products were processed, and such other information as the
    Secretary may require by regulations to describe the products
    adequately and to assure that they will not have false or
    misleading labeling.
    (b) False or misleading or use of nonapproved labeling or
      containers; determination by Secretary; procedures applicable;
      appeal
      No labeling or container shall be used for egg products at
    official plants if it is false or misleading or has not been
    approved as required by the regulations of the Secretary. If the
    Secretary has reason to believe that any labeling or the size or
    form of any container in use or proposed for use with respect to
    egg products at any official plant is false or misleading in any
    particular, he may direct that such use be withheld unless the
    labeling or container is modified in such manner as he may
    prescribe so that it will not be false or misleading. If the person
    using or proposing to use the labeling or container does not accept
    the determination of the Secretary, such person may request a
    hearing, but the use of the labeling or container shall, if the
    Secretary so directs, be withheld pending hearing and final
    determination by the Secretary. Any such determination by the
    Secretary shall be conclusive unless, within thirty days after
    receipt of notice of such final determination, the person adversely
    affected thereby appeals to the United States court of appeals for
    the circuit in which such person has its principal place of
    business or to the United States Court of Appeals for the District
    of Columbia Circuit. The provisions of section 194 of title 7,(!1)
    shall be applicable to appeals taken under this section.

    after the penalty has become a final and unappealable order, or
    after the appropriate court of appeals has entered a final judgment

    his receipt, carriage, holding, or delivery, in the usual course of
    business, as a carrier or warehouseman of eggs or egg products
    owned by another person unless the carrier or warehouseman has

    reasonable person to believe that such eggs or egg products were
    not eligible for transportation under, or were otherwise in
    violation of, this chapter, or unless the carrier or warehouseman
    refuses to furnish on request of a representative of the Secretary

    he may prescribe, exempt any plant located within noncontiguous
    areas of the United States from specific provisions of this
    chapter, where, despite good faith efforts by the owner of such
    plant, such owner has not been able to bring his plant into full
    compliance with this chapter: Provided, That in order to provide at
    least minimum standards for the protection of the public health,
    whenever processing operations are being conducted at any such
    plant, continuous inspection shall be maintained to assure that it
    is operated in a sanitary manner. No exemption under this
    subsection shall be granted for a period extending beyond December
    31, 1971.
    (c) Suspension or termination of exemptions
      The Secretary may immediately suspend or terminate any exemption
    under subsection (a)(2) or (6) of this section at any time with
    respect to any person, if the conditions of exemption prescribed by
    this section or the regulations of the Secretary are not being met.
    The Secretary may modify or revoke any regulation granting
    exemption under this chapter whenever he deems such action
    appropriate to effectuate the purposes of this chapter.

-STATUTE-
      The Secretary (for such period, or indefinitely, as he deems
    necessary to effectuate the purposes of this chapter) may refuse to
    provide or may withdraw inspection service under this chapter with
    respect to any plant if he determines, after opportunity for a
    hearing is accorded to the applicant for, or recipient of, such
    service, that such applicant or recipient is unfit to engage in any
    business requiring inspection under this chapter because the
    applicant or recipient or anyone responsibly connected with the
    applicant or recipient has been convicted in any Federal or State
    court, within the previous ten years, of (1) any felony or more
    than one misdemeanor under any law based upon the acquiring,
    handling, or distributing of adulterated, mislabeled, or
    deceptively packaged food or fraud in connection with transactions
    in food, or (2) any felony, involving fraud, bribery, extortion, or
    any other act or circumstances indicating a lack of the integrity
    needed for the conduct of operations affecting the public health.
      For the purpose of this section, a person shall be deemed to be
    responsibly connected with the business if he is a partner,
    officer, director, holder, or owner of 10 per centum or more of its
    voting stock, or employee in a managerial or executive capacity.
      The determination and order of the Secretary with respect thereto
    under this section shall be final and conclusive unless the
    affected applicant for, or recipient of, inspection service files
    application for judicial review within thirty days after the
    effective date of such order in the United States court of appeals
    for the circuit in which such applicant or recipient has its
    principal place of business or in the United States Court of
    Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Judicial review of
    any such order shall be upon the record upon which the
    determination and order are based. The provisions of section 194 of
    title 7 shall be applicable to appeals taken under this section.
      This section shall not affect in any way other provisions of this
    chapter for refusal of inspection services.

      Whenever any eggs or egg products subject to this chapter, are
    found by any authorized representative of the Secretary upon any
    premises and there is reason to believe that they are or have been
    processed, bought, sold, possessed, used, transported, or offered
    or received for sale or transportation in violation of this chapter
    or that they are in any other way in violation of this chapter, or
    whenever any restricted eggs capable of use as human food are found
    by such a representative in the possession of any person not
    authorized to acquire such eggs under the regulations of the
    Secretary, such articles may be detained by such representative for
    a reasonable period but not to exceed twenty days, pending action
    under section 1049 of this title or notification of any Federal,
    State, or other governmental authorities having jurisdiction over
    such articles and shall not be moved by any person from the place
    at which they are located when so detained until released by such
    representative. All official marks may be required by such
    representative to be removed from such articles before they are
    released unless it appears to the satisfaction of the Secretary
    that the articles are eligible to retain such marks.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Jurisdiction; disposal of condemned articles; court costs and
      fees; conformity to supplemental rules for admiralty and maritime
      claims; jury trial; United States as plaintiff
      Any eggs or egg products that are or have been processed, bought,
    sold, possessed, used, transported, or offered or received for sale
    or transportation, in violation of this chapter, or in any other
    way are in violation of this chapter; and any restricted eggs,
    capable of use as human food, in the possession of any person not
    authorized to acquire such eggs under the regulations of the
    Secretary shall be liable to be proceeded against and seized and
    condemned, at any time, on a complaint in any United States
    district court or other proper court as provided in section 1050 of
    this title within the jurisdiction of which the articles are found.
    If the articles are condemned they shall, after entry of the
    decree, be disposed of by destruction or sale as the court may
    direct and the proceeds, if sold, less the court costs and fees,
    and storage and other proper expenses, shall be paid into the
    Treasury of the United States, but the articles shall not be sold
    contrary to the provision of this chapter, the Federal Food, Drug,
    and Cosmetic Act [21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.] or the Fair Packaging and
    Labeling Act [15 U.S.C. 1451 et seq.], or the laws of the
    jurisdiction in which they are sold: Provided, That upon the
    execution and delivery of a good and sufficient bond conditioned
    that the articles shall not be sold or otherwise disposed of
    contrary to the provisions of this chapter, the Federal Food, Drug,
    and Cosmetic Act, the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act, or the laws
    of the jurisdiction in which disposal is made, the court may direct
    that they be delivered to the owner thereof subject to such
    supervision by authorized representatives of the Secretary as is
    necessary to insure compliance with the applicable laws. When a
    decree of condemnation is entered against the articles and they are
    released under bond, or destroyed, court costs and fees, and
    storage and other proper expenses shall be awarded against the
    person, if any, intervening as claimant thereof. The proceedings in
    such cases shall conform, as nearly as may be, to the supplemental
    rules for certain admiralty and maritime claims, except that either
    party may demand trial by jury of any issue of fact joined in any
    case, and all such proceedings shall be at the suit of and in the
    name of the United States.
    (b) Condemnation or seizure under other provisions unaffected
      The provisions of this section shall in no way derogate from
    authority for condemnation or seizure conferred by other provisions
    of this chapter, or other laws.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Prohibition against additional or different requirements than
      Federal requirements relating to premises, facilities, and
      operations at official plants; authority to impose recordkeeping
      and related requirements consistent with Federal requirements
      Requirements within the scope of this chapter with respect to
    premises, facilities, and operations of any official plant which
    are in addition to or different than those made under this chapter
    may not be imposed by any State or local jurisdiction except that
    any such jurisdiction may impose recordkeeping and other
    requirements within the scope of section 1040 of this title, if
    consistent therewith, with respect to any such plant.
    (b) Prohibition against additional or different standards than
      Federal standards of quality, etc., or requiring labeling to show
      area of production or origin; authority to require name, address,
      and license number of processor or packer on containers;
      prohibition against additional or different requirements than
      Federal requirements relating to labeling, packaging or
      ingredients; authority to prevent distribution of violative
      articles; validity of nonconflicting laws
      For eggs which have moved or are moving in interstate or foreign
    commerce, (1) no State or local jurisdiction may require the use of
    standards of quality, condition, weight, quantity, or grade which
    are in addition to or different from the official Federal
    standards, (2) with respect to egg handlers specified in paragraphs
    (1) and (2) of section 1034(e) of this title, no State or local
    jurisdiction may impose temperature requirements pertaining to eggs
    packaged for the ultimate consumer which are in addition to, or
    different from, Federal requirements, and (3) no State or local
    jurisdiction other than those in noncontiguous areas of the United
    States may require labeling to show the State or other geographical
    area of production or origin: Provided, however, That this shall
    not preclude a State from requiring that the name, address, and
    license number of the person processing or packaging eggs, be shown
    on each container. Labeling, packaging, or ingredient requirements,
    in addition to or different than those made under this chapter, the
    Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.] and
    the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act [15 U.S.C. 1451 et seq.], may
    not be imposed by any State or local jurisdiction, with respect to
    egg products processed at any official plant in accordance with the
    requirements under this chapter and such Acts. However, any State
    or local jurisdiction may exercise jurisdiction with respect to
    eggs and egg products for the purpose of preventing the
    distribution for human food purposes of any such articles which are
    outside of such a plant and are in violation of any of said Federal
    Acts or any State or local law consistent therewith. Otherwise the
    provisions of this chapter shall not invalidate any law or other
    provisions of any State or other jurisdiction in the absence of a
    conflict with this chapter.
    (c) Applicability of other Federal laws and authority of other
      Federal officials relating to eggs, egg products, or other food
      products unaffected; authority of Secretary of Agriculture to
      regulate official plants processing egg products
      The provisions of this chapter shall not affect the applicability
    of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.]
    or the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act [15 U.S.C. 1451 et seq.] or
    other Federal laws to eggs, egg products, or other food products or
    diminish any authority conferred on the Secretary of Health and
    Human Services or other Federal officials by such other laws,
    except that the Secretary of Agriculture shall have exclusive
    jurisdiction to regulate official plants processing egg products
    and operations thereof as to all matters within the scope of this
    chapter.
    (d) Detainer authority
      The detainer authority conferred on representatives of the
    Secretary of Agriculture by section 1048 of this title shall also
    apply to any authorized representative of the Secretary of Health
    and Human Services for the purposes of section 1034(d) of this
    title, with respect to any eggs or egg products that are outside
    any plant processing egg products.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1101. Congressional findings

-STATUTE-
      The Congress makes the following findings:
        (1) Drug abuse is rapidly increasing in the United States and
      now afflicts urban, suburban, and rural areas of the Nation.
        (2) Drug abuse seriously impairs individual, as well as
      societal, health and well-being.
        (3) Drug abuse, especially heroin addiction, substantially
      contributes to crime.
        (4) The adverse impact of drug abuse inflicts increasing pain
      and hardship on individuals, families, and communities and
      undermines our institutions.
        (5) Too little is known about drug abuse, especially the
      causes, and ways to treat and prevent drug abuse.
        (6) The success of Federal drug abuse programs and activities
      requires a recognition that education, treatment, rehabilitation,
      research, training, and law enforcement efforts are interrelated.
        (7) The effectiveness of efforts by State and local governments
      and by the Federal Government to control and treat drug abuse in
      the United States has been hampered by a lack of coordination
      among the States, between States and localities, among the
      Federal Government, States and localities, and throughout the
      Federal establishment.
        (8) Control of drug abuse requires the development of a
      comprehensive, coordinated long-term Federal strategy that
      encompasses both effective law enforcement against illegal drug
      traffic and effective health programs to rehabilitate victims of
      drug abuse.
        (9) The increasing rate of drug abuse constitutes a serious and
      continuing threat to national health and welfare, requiring an
      immediate and effective response on the part of the Federal
      Government.
        (10) Although the Congress observed a significant apparent
      reduction in the rate of increase of drug abuse during the three-
      year period subsequent to March 21, 1972, and in certain areas
      of the country apparent temporary reductions in its incidence,
      the increase and spread of heroin consumption since 1974, and the
      continuing abuse of other dangerous drugs, clearly indicate the
      need for effective, ongoing, and highly visible Federal
      leadership in the formation and execution of a comprehensive,
      coordinated drug abuse policy.
        (11) Shifts in the usage of various drugs and in the Nation's
      demographic composition require a Federal strategy to adjust the
      focus of drug abuse programs to meet new needs and priorities on
      a cost-effective basis.
        (12) The growing extent of drug abuse indicates an urgent need
      for prevention and intervention programs designed to reach the
      general population and members of high risk populations such as
      youth, women, and the elderly.
        (13) Effective control of drug abuse requires high-level
      coordination of Federal international and domestic activities
      relating to both supply of, and demand for, commonly abused
      drugs.
        (14) Local governments with high concentrations of drug abuse
      should be actively involved in the planning and coordination of
      efforts to combat drug abuse.

-STATUTE-
      The Congress declares that it is the policy of the United States
    and the purpose of this chapter to focus the comprehensive
    resources of the Federal Government and bring them to bear on drug
    abuse with the objective of significantly reducing the incidence,
    as well as the social and personal costs, of drug abuse in the
    United States, and to develop and assure the implementation of a
    comprehensive, coordinated long-term Federal strategy to combat
    drug abuse. To reach these goals, the Congress further declares
    that it is the policy of the United States and the purpose of this
    chapter to meet the problems of drug abuse through - 
        (1) comprehensive Federal, State, and local planning for, and
      effective use of, Federal assistance to States and to community-
      based programs to meet the urgent needs of special populations,
      in coordination with all other governmental and nongovernmental
      sources of assistance;
        (2) the development and support of community-based prevention
      programs;
        (3) the development and encouragement of effective occupational
      prevention and treatment programs within the Government and in
      cooperation with the private sector; and
        (4) increased Federal commitment to research into the
      behavioral and biomedical etiology of, the treatment of, and the
      mental and physical health and social and economic consequences
      of, drug abuse.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Scope of programs; priority
      The Secretary (!1) acting through the National Institute on Drug
    Abuse, may make grants to and enter into contracts with individuals
    and public and private nonprofit entities - 

        (1) to provide training seminars, educational programs, and
      technical assistance for the development, demonstration, and
      evaluation of drug abuse prevention, treatment, and
      rehabilitation programs; and

      high priority on prevention and early intervention projects and
      on identifying new and more effective drug abuse prevention,
      treatment, and rehabilitation programs.

    In the implementation of his authority under this section, the
    Secretary shall accord a high priority to applications for grants
    or contracts for primary prevention programs. For purposes of the

    funding to treatment for opiate abuse, but shall also provide
    support for treatment for non-opiate drug abuse including polydrug
    abuse. Furthermore, nothing shall prevent the use of funds provided

    and activities. For grants and contracts under paragraphs (3) and
    (6) of subsection (a) of this section for drug abuse treatment
    programs there is authorized to be appropriated $149,000,000 for

    preceding sentence for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1980,
    at least 7 percent of the funds shall be obligated for grants and
    contracts for primary prevention and intervention programs designed

    populations, from abusing drugs; and of the funds appropriated
    under the preceding sentence for the next fiscal year, at least 10
    percent of the funds shall be obligated for such grants and
    contracts. For carrying out the purposes of this section, there are
    authorized to be appropriated $15,000,000 for the fiscal year
    ending September 30, 1982. Of the funds appropriated under the
    preceding sentence, at least 25 per centum of the funds shall be

    intervention programs designed to discourage individuals,

    (a) Cooperative agreements
      The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall enter into
    cooperative agreements with the governments of the countries which
    are the major sources of food imports into the United States
    subject to pesticide residue monitoring by the Food and Drug
    Administration for the purpose of improving the ability of the Food
    and Drug Administration to assure compliance with the pesticide
    tolerance requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act
    [21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.] with regard to imported food.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1521. Findings

-STATUTE-
      Congress finds the following:
        (1) Substance abuse among youth has more than doubled in the 5-
      year period preceding 1996, with substantial increases in the
      use of marijuana, inhalants, cocaine, methamphetamine, LSD, and
      heroin.
        (2) The most dramatic increases in substance abuse has occurred
      among 13- and 14-year-olds.
        (3) Casual or periodic substance abuse by youth today will
      contribute to hard core or chronic substance abuse by the next
      generation of adults.
        (4) Substance abuse is at the core of other problems, such as
      rising violent teenage and violent gang crime, increasing health
      care costs, HIV infections, teenage pregnancy, high school
      dropouts, and lower economic productivity.
        (5) Increases in substance abuse among youth are due in large
      part to an erosion of understanding by youth of the high risks
      associated with substance abuse, and to the softening of peer
      norms against use.
        (6)(A) Substance abuse is a preventable behavior and a
      treatable disease; and
        (B)(i) during the 13-year period beginning with 1979, monthly
      use of illegal drugs among youth 12 to 17 years of age declined
      by over 70 percent; and
        (ii) data suggests that if parents would simply talk to their
      children regularly about the dangers of substance abuse, use
      among youth could be expected to decline by as much as 30
      percent.
        (7) Community anti-drug coalitions throughout the United States
      are successfully developing and implementing comprehensive, long-
      term strategies to reduce substance abuse among youth on a
      sustained basis.
        (8) Intergovernmental cooperation and coordination through
      national, State, and local or tribal leadership and partnerships
      are critical to facilitate the reduction of substance abuse among
      youth in communities throughout the United States.

    2(a)(2), June 27, 1997, 111 Stat. 224.)


-MISC1-
       FIVE-YEAR EXTENSION OF DRUG-FREE COMMUNITIES SUPPORT PROGRAM   
      Pub. L. 107-82, Sec. 1(a), Dec. 14, 2001, 115 Stat. 814, provided
    that: "Congress makes the following findings:
        "(1) In the next 15 years, the youth population in the United
      States will grow by 21 percent, adding 6,500,000 youth to the
      population of the United States. Even if drug use rates remain
      constant, there will be a huge surge in drug-related problems,
      such as academic failure, drug-related violence, and HIV
      incidence, simply due to this population increase.
        "(2) According to the 1994-1996 National Household Survey, 60
      percent of students age 12 to 17 who frequently cut classes and
      who reported delinquent behavior in the past 6 months used
      marijuana 52 days or more in the previous year.
        "(3) The 2000 Washington Kids Count survey conducted by the
      University of Washington reported that students whose peers have
      little or no involvement with drinking and drugs have higher math
      and reading scores than students whose peers had low level
      drinking or drug use.
        "(4) Substance abuse prevention works. In 1999, only 10 percent
      of teens saw marijuana users as popular, compared to 17 percent
      in 1998 and 19 percent in 1997. The rate of past-month use of any
      drug among 12- to 17-year-olds declined 26 percent between 1997
      and 1999. Marijuana use for sixth through eighth graders is at
      the lowest point in 5 years, as is use of cocaine, inhalants, and
      hallucinogens.
        "(5) Community Anti-Drug Coalitions throughout the United
      States are successfully developing and implementing
      comprehensive, long-term strategies to reduce substance abuse
      among youth on a sustained basis. For example:
          "(A) The Boston Coalition brought college and university
        presidents together to create the Cooperative Agreement on
        Underage Drinking. This agreement represents the first
        coordinated effort of Boston's many institutions of higher
        education to address issues such as binge drinking, underage
        drinking, and changing the norms surrounding alcohol abuse that
        exist on college and university campuses.
          "(B) In 2000, the Coalition for a Drug-Free Greater
        Cincinnati surveyed more than 47,000 local students in grades 7
        through 12. The results provided evidence that the Coalition's
        initiatives are working. For the first time in a decade, teen
        drug use in Greater Cincinnati appears to be leveling off. The
        data collected from the survey has served as a tool to
        strengthen relationships between schools and communities, as
        well as facilitate the growth of anti-drug coalitions in
        communities where such coalitions had not existed.
          "(C) The Miami Coalition used a three-part strategy to
        decrease the percentage of high school seniors who reported
        using marijuana at least once during the most recent 30-day
        period. The development of a media strategy, the creation of a
        network of prevention agencies, and discussions with high
        school students about the dangers of marijuana all contributed
        to a decrease in the percentage of seniors who reported using
        marijuana from over 22 percent in 1995 to 9 percent in 1997.
        The Miami Coalition was able to achieve these results while
        national rates of marijuana use were increasing.
          "(D) The Nashville Prevention Partnership worked with
        elementary and middle school children in an attempt to
        influence them toward positive life goals and discourage them
        from using substances. The Partnership targeted an area in East
        Nashville and created after school programs, mentoring
        opportunities, attendance initiatives, and safe passages to and
        from school. Attendance and test scores increased as a result
        of the program.
          "(E) At a youth-led town meeting sponsored by the Bering
        Strait Community Partnership in Nome, Alaska, youth identified
        a need for a safe, substance-free space. With help from a
        variety of community partners, the Partnership staff and youth
        members created the Java Hut, a substance-free coffeehouse
        designed for youth. The Java Hut is helping to change norms in
        the community by providing a fun, youth-friendly atmosphere and
        activities that are not centered around alcohol or marijuana.
          "(F) Portland's Regional Drug Initiative (RDI) has promoted
        the establishment of drug-free workplaces among the city's
        large and small employers. Over 3,000 employers have attended
        an RDI training session, and of those, 92 percent have
        instituted drug-free workplace policies. As a result, there has
        been a 5.5 percent decrease in positive workplace drug tests.
          "(G) San Antonio Fighting Back worked to increase the age at
        which youth first used illegal substances. Research suggests
        that the later the age of first use, the lower the risk that a
        young person will become a regular substance abuser. As a
        result, the age of first illegal drug use increased from 9.4
        years in 1992 to 13.5 years in 1997.
          "(H) In 1990, multiple data sources confirmed a trend of
        increased alcohol use by teenagers in the Troy community. Using
        its 'multiple strategies over multiple sectors' approach, the
        Troy Coalition worked with parents, physicians, students,
        coaches, and others to address this problem from several
        angles. As a result, the rate of twelfth grade students who had
        consumed alcohol in the past month decreased from 62.1 percent
        to 53.3 percent between 1991 and 1998, and the rate of eighth
        grade students decreased from 26.3 percent to 17.4 percent. The
        Troy Coalition believes that this decline represents not only a
        change in behavior on the part of students, but also a change
        in the norms of the community.
        "(6) Despite these successes, drug use continues to be a
      serious problem facing communities across the United States. For
      example:
          "(A) According to the Pulse Check: Trends in Drug Abuse Mid-
        Year 2000 report - 
            "(i) crack and powder cocaine remains the most serious drug
          problem;
            "(ii) marijuana remains the most widely available illicit
          drug, and its potency is on the rise;
            "(iii) treatment sources report an increase in admissions
          with marijuana as the primary drug of abuse - and adolescents
          outnumber other age groups entering treatment for marijuana;
            "(iv) 80 percent of Pulse Check sources reported increased
          availability of club drugs, with ecstasy (MDMA) and ketamine
          the most widely cited club drugs and seven sources reporting
          that powder cocaine is being used as a club drug by young
          adults;
            "(v) ecstasy abuse and trafficking is expanding, no longer
          confined to the 'rave' scene;
            "(vi) the sale and use of club drugs has grown from
          nightclubs and raves to high schools, the streets,
          neighborhoods, open venues, and younger ages;
            "(vii) ecstasy users often are unknowingly purchasing
          adulterated tablets or some other substance sold as MDMA; and
            "(viii) along with reports of increased heroin snorting as
          a route of administration for initiates, there is also an
          increase in injecting initiates and the negative health
          consequences associated with injection (for example,
          increases in HIV/AIDS and Hepatitis C) suggesting that there
          is a generational forgetting of the dangers of injection of
          the drug.
          "(B) The 2000 Parent's Resource Institute for Drug Education
        study reported that 23.6 percent of children in the sixth
        through twelfth grades used illicit drugs in the past year. The
        same study found that monthly usage among this group was 15.3
        percent.
          "(C) According to the 2000 Monitoring the Future study, the
        use of ecstasy among eighth graders increased from 1.7 percent
        in 1999 to 3.1 percent in 2000, among tenth graders from 4.4
        percent to 5.4 percent, and from 5.6 percent to 8.2 percent
        among twelfth graders.
          "(D) A 1999 Mellman Group study found that - 
            "(i) 56 percent of the population in the United States
          believed that drug use was increasing in 1999;
            "(ii) 92 percent of the population viewed illegal drug use
          as a serious problem in the United States; and
            "(iii) 73 percent of the population viewed illegal drug use
          as a serious problem in their communities.
        "(7) According to the 2001 report of the National Center on
      Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University entitled
      'Shoveling Up: The Impact of Substance Abuse on State Budgets',
      using the most conservative assumption, in 1998 States spent
      $77,900,000,000 to shovel up the wreckage of substance abuse,
      only $3,000,000,000 to prevent and treat the problem and
      $433,000,000 for alcohol and tobacco regulation and compliance.
      This $77,900,000,000 burden was distributed as follows:
          "(A) $30,700,000,000 in the justice system (77 percent of
        justice spending).
          "(B) $16,500,000,000 in education costs (10 percent of
        education spending).
          "(C) $15,200,000,000 in health costs (25 percent of health
        spending).
          "(D) $7,700,000,000 in child and family assistance (32
        percent of child and family assistance spending).
          "(E) $5,900,000,000 in mental health and developmental
        disabilities (31 percent of mental health spending).
          "(F) $1,500,000,000 in public safety (26 percent of public
        safety spending) and $400,000,000 for the state workforce.
        "(8) Intergovernmental cooperation and coordination through
      national, State, and local or tribal leadership and partnerships
      are critical to facilitate the reduction of substance abuse among
      youth in communities across the United States.
        "(9) Substance abuse is perceived as a much greater problem
      nationally than at the community level. According to a 2001 study
      sponsored by The Pew Charitable Trusts, between 1994 and 2000 - 
          "(A) there was a 43 percent increase in the percentage of
        Americans who felt progress was being made in the war on drugs
        at the community level;
          "(B) only 9 percent of Americans say drug abuse is a 'crisis'
        in their neighborhood, compared to 27 percent who say this
        about the nation; and
          "(C) the percentage of those who felt we lost ground in the
        war on drugs on a community level fell by more than a quarter,
        from 51 percent in 1994 to 37 percent in 2000."

        an additional grant under this section only under this
        paragraph.
        (C) No priority for applications
          The Administrator may not afford a higher priority in the

          If a grant recipient under this paragraph fails to continue
        to meet the criteria specified in subsection (a) of this
        section, the Administrator may suspend the grant, after
        providing written notice to the grant recipient and an
        opportunity to appeal.
        (F) Limitation
          The amount of a grant award under this paragraph may not
        exceed $125,000 for a fiscal year.
      (4) Process for suspension
        A grantee shall not be suspended or terminated under paragraph

      afforded a fair, timely, and independent appeal prior to such
      suspension or termination.
    (c) Treatment of funds for coalitions representing certain
      organizations
      Funds appropriated for the substance abuse activities of a

    with expertise in the field of substance abuse may be counted as
    non-Federal funds raised by the coalition for purposes of this
    section.
    (d) Priority in awarding grants
      In awarding grants under subsection (b)(1)(A)(i) of this section,
    priority shall be given to a coalition serving economically
    disadvantaged areas.

    of application for such renewal grant - 
        (1) continues to meet the criteria specified in subsection (d)
      of this section; and
        (2) has made demonstrable progress in the development of one or
      more new, self-supporting community coalitions that are focused

      Funds appropriated for the substance abuse activities of a
      coalition that includes a representative of the Bureau of Indian
      Affairs, the Indian Health Service, or a tribal government agency
      with expertise in the field of substance abuse may be counted as
      non-Federal funds raised by the coalition.
      (2) Initial grants
        The amount of the initial grant awarded to a coalition under
      subsection (a) of this section may not exceed $75,000.

    CHAPTER 21 - BIOMATERIALS ACCESS ASSURANCE

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1601. Findings

-STATUTE-
      The Congress finds that - 
        (1) each year millions of citizens of the United States depend
      on the availability of lifesaving or life-enhancing medical
      devices, many of which are permanently implantable within the
      human body;
        (2) a continued supply of raw materials and component parts is
      necessary for the invention, development, improvement, and
      maintenance of the supply of the devices;
        (3) most of the medical devices are made with raw materials and
      component parts that - 
          (A) move in interstate commerce;
          (B) are not designed or manufactured specifically for use in
        medical devices; and
          (C) come in contact with internal human tissue;

        (4) the raw materials and component parts also are used in a
      variety of nonmedical products;
        (5) because small quantities of the raw materials and component
      parts are used for medical devices, sales of raw materials and
      component parts for medical devices constitute an extremely small
      portion of the overall market for the raw materials and component
      parts;
        (6) under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C.
      301 et seq.) manufacturers of medical devices are required to
      demonstrate that the medical devices are safe and effective,
      including demonstrating that the products are properly designed
      and have adequate warnings or instructions;
        (7) notwithstanding the fact that raw materials and component
      parts suppliers do not design, produce, or test a final medical
      device, the suppliers have been the subject of actions alleging
      inadequate - 
          (A) design and testing of medical devices manufactured with
        materials or parts supplied by the suppliers; or
          (B) warnings related to the use of such medical devices;

        (8) even though suppliers of raw materials and component parts
      have very rarely been held liable in such actions, such suppliers
      have ceased supplying certain raw materials and component parts
      for use in medical devices for a number of reasons, including
      concerns about the costs of such litigation;
        (9) unless alternate sources of supply can be found, the
      unavailability of raw materials and component parts for medical
      devices will lead to unavailability of lifesaving and life-
      enhancing medical devices;
        (10) because other suppliers of the raw materials and component
      parts in foreign nations are refusing to sell raw materials or
      component parts for use in manufacturing certain medical devices
      in the United States, the prospects for development of new
      sources of supply for the full range of threatened raw materials
      and component parts for medical devices are remote;
        (11) it is unlikely that the small market for such raw
      materials and component parts in the United States could support
      the large investment needed to develop new suppliers of such raw
      materials and component parts;
        (12) attempts to develop such new suppliers would raise the
      cost of medical devices;
        (13) courts that have considered the duties of the suppliers of
      the raw materials and component parts have generally found that
      the suppliers do not have a duty - 
          (A) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the use of a raw
        material or component part in a medical device; or
          (B) to warn consumers concerning the safety and effectiveness
        of a medical device;

        (14) because medical devices and the raw materials and
      component parts used in their manufacture move in interstate
      commerce, a shortage of such raw materials and component parts
      affects interstate commerce;
        (15) in order to safeguard the availability of a wide variety
      of lifesaving and life-enhancing medical devices, immediate
      action is needed - 
          (A) to clarify the permissible bases of liability for
        suppliers of raw materials and component parts for medical
        devices; and
          (B) to provide expeditious procedures to dispose of
        unwarranted suits against the suppliers in such manner as to
        minimize litigation costs;

        (16) the several States and their courts are the primary
      architects and regulators of our tort system; Congress, however,
      must, in certain circumstances involving the national interest,
      address tort issues, and a threatened shortage of raw materials
      and component parts for lifesaving medical devices is one such
      circumstance; and
        (17) the protections set forth in this chapter are needed to
      assure the continued supply of materials for lifesaving medical
      devices, although such protections do not protect negligent
      suppliers.

    Sec. 1604. Liability of biomaterials suppliers

-STATUTE-
    (a) In general
      Except as provided in section 1606 of this title, a biomaterials
    supplier shall not be liable for harm to a claimant caused by an
    implant unless such supplier is liable - 
        (1) as a manufacturer of the implant, as provided in subsection
      (b) of this section;
        (2) as a seller of the implant, as provided in subsection (c)
      of this section; or
        (3) for furnishing raw materials or component parts for the
      implant that failed to meet applicable contractual requirements
      or specifications, as provided in subsection (d) of this section.
    (b) Liability as manufacturer
      (1) In general
        A biomaterials supplier may, to the extent required and
      permitted by any other applicable law, be liable for harm to a
      claimant caused by an implant if the biomaterials supplier is the
      manufacturer of the implant.
      (2) Grounds for liability
        The biomaterials supplier may be considered the manufacturer of
      the implant that allegedly caused harm to a claimant only if the
      biomaterials supplier - 
          (A)(i) registered or was required to register with the
        Secretary pursuant to section 360 of this title and the
        regulations issued under such section; and
          (ii) included or was required to include the implant on a
        list of devices filed with the Secretary pursuant to section
        360(j) of this title and the regulations issued under such
        section;
          (B) is the subject of a declaration issued by the Secretary
        pursuant to paragraph (3) that states that the supplier, with
        respect to the implant that allegedly caused harm to the
        claimant, was required to - 
            (i) register with the Secretary under section 360 of this
          title, and the regulations issued under such section, but
          failed to do so; or
            (ii) include the implant on a list of devices filed with
          the Secretary pursuant to section 360(j) of this title and
          the regulations issued under such section, but failed to do
          so; or

          (C) is related by common ownership or control to a person
        meeting all the requirements described in subparagraph (A) or
        (B), if the court deciding a motion to dismiss in accordance
        with section 1605(c)(3)(B)(i) of this title finds, on the basis
        of affidavits submitted in accordance with section 1605 of this
        title, that it is necessary to impose liability on the
        biomaterials supplier as a manufacturer because the related
        manufacturer meeting the requirements of subparagraph (A) or
        (B) lacks sufficient financial resources to satisfy any
        judgment that the court feels it is likely to enter should the
        claimant prevail.
      (3) Administrative procedures
        (A) In general
          The Secretary may issue a declaration described in paragraph
        (2)(B) on the motion of the Secretary or on petition by any
        person, after providing - 
            (i) notice to the affected persons; and
            (ii) an opportunity for an informal hearing.
        (B) Docketing and final decision
          Immediately upon receipt of a petition filed pursuant to this
        paragraph, the Secretary shall docket the petition. Not later
        than 120 days after the petition is filed, the Secretary shall
        issue a final decision on the petition.
        (C) Applicability of statute of limitations
          Any applicable statute of limitations shall toll during the
        period from the time a claimant files a petition with the
        Secretary under this paragraph until such time as either (i)
        the Secretary issues a final decision on the petition, or (ii)
        the petition is withdrawn.
        (D) Stay pending petition for declaration
          If a claimant has filed a petition for a declaration with
        respect to a defendant, and the Secretary has not issued a
        final decision on the petition, the court shall stay all
        proceedings with respect to that defendant until such time as
        the Secretary has issued a final decision on the petition.
    (c) Liability as seller
      A biomaterials supplier may, to the extent required and permitted
    by any other applicable law, be liable as a seller for harm to a
    claimant caused by an implant only if - 
        (1) the biomaterials supplier - 
          (A) held title to the implant and then acted as a seller of
        the implant after its initial sale by the manufacturer; or
          (B) acted under contract as a seller to arrange for the
        transfer of the implant directly to the claimant after the
        initial sale by the manufacturer of the implant; or

        (2) the biomaterials supplier is related by common ownership or
      control to a person meeting all the requirements described in
      paragraph (1), if a court deciding a motion to dismiss in
      accordance with section 1605(c)(3)(B)(ii) of this title finds, on
      the basis of affidavits submitted in accordance with section 1605
      of this title, that it is necessary to impose liability on the
      biomaterials supplier as a seller because the related seller
      meeting the requirements of paragraph (1) lacks sufficient
      financial resources to satisfy any judgment that the court feels
      it is likely to enter should the claimant prevail.
    (d) Liability for failure to meet applicable contractual
      requirements or specifications
      A biomaterials supplier may, to the extent required and permitted
    by any other applicable law, be liable for harm to a claimant
    caused by an implant if the claimant in an action shows, by a
    preponderance of the evidence, that - 
        (1) the biomaterials supplier supplied raw materials or
      component parts for use in the implant that either - 
          (A) did not constitute the product described in the contract
        between the biomaterials supplier and the person who contracted
        for the supplying of the product; or
          (B) failed to meet any specifications that were - 
            (i) accepted, pursuant to applicable law, by the
          biomaterials supplier;
            (ii) published by the biomaterials supplier;
            (iii) provided by the biomaterials supplier to the person
          who contracted for such product;
            (iv) contained in a master file that was submitted by the
          biomaterials supplier to the Secretary and that is currently
          maintained by the biomaterials supplier for purposes of
          premarket approval of medical devices; or
            (v) included in the submissions for purposes of premarket
          approval or review by the Secretary under section 360, 360c,
          360e, or 360j of this title, and received clearance from the
          Secretary if such specifications were accepted, pursuant to
          applicable law, by the biomaterials supplier; and

        (2) such failure to meet applicable contractual requirements or
      specifications was an actual and proximate cause of the harm to
      the claimant.

    Sec. 1605. Procedures for dismissal of civil actions against
      biomaterials suppliers

-STATUTE-
    (a) Motion to dismiss
      A defendant may, at any time during which a motion to dismiss may
    be filed under applicable law, move to dismiss an action against it
    on the grounds that the defendant is a biomaterials supplier and
    one or more of the following:
        (1) The defendant is not liable as a manufacturer, as provided
      in section 1604(b) of this title.
        (2) The defendant is not liable as a seller, as provided in
      section 1604(c) of this title.
        (3) The defendant is not liable for furnishing raw materials or
      component parts for the implant that failed to meet applicable
      contractual requirements or specifications, as provided in
      section 1604(d) of this title.
        (4) The claimant did not name the manufacturer as a party to
      the action, as provided in subsection (b) of this section.
    (b) Manufacturer of implant shall be named a party
      In any civil action covered by this chapter, the claimant shall
    be required to name the manufacturer of the implant as a party to
    the action, unless - 
        (1) the manufacturer is subject to service of process solely in
      a jurisdiction in which the biomaterials supplier is not
      domiciled or subject to a service of process; or
        (2) a claim against the manufacturer is barred by applicable
      law or rule of practice.
    (c) Proceeding on motion to dismiss
      The following rules shall apply to any proceeding on a motion to
    dismiss filed by a defendant under this section:
      (1) Effect of motion to dismiss on discovery
        (A) In general
          Except as provided in subparagraph (B), if a defendant files
        a motion to dismiss under subsection (a) of this section, no
        discovery shall be permitted in connection with the action that
        is the subject of the motion, other than discovery necessary to
        determine a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, until
        such time as the court rules on the motion to dismiss.
        (B) Discovery
          If a defendant files a motion to dismiss under subsection
        (a)(3) of this section on the grounds that it did not furnish
        raw materials or component parts for the implant that failed to
        meet applicable contractual requirements or specifications, the
        court may permit discovery limited to issues that are directly
        relevant to - 
            (i) the pending motion to dismiss; or
            (ii) the jurisdiction of the court.
      (2) Affidavits
        (A) Defendant
          A defendant may submit affidavits supporting the grounds for
        dismissal contained in its motion to dismiss under subsection
        (a) of this section. If the motion is made under subsection
        (a)(1) of this section, the defendant may submit an affidavit
        demonstrating that the defendant has not included the implant
        on a list, if any, filed with the Secretary pursuant to section
        360(j) of this title.
        (B) Claimant
          In response to a motion to dismiss, the claimant may submit
        affidavits demonstrating that - 
            (i) the Secretary has, with respect to the defendant and
          the implant that allegedly caused harm to the claimant,
          issued a declaration pursuant to section 1604(b)(2)(B) of
          this title; or
            (ii) the defendant is a seller of the implant who is liable
          under section 1604(c) of this title.
      (3) Basis of ruling on motion to dismiss
        The court shall rule on a motion to dismiss filed under
      subsection (a) of this section solely on the basis of the
      pleadings and affidavits of the parties made pursuant to this
      subsection. The court shall grant a motion to dismiss filed under
      subsection (a) of this section - 
          (A) unless the claimant submits a valid affidavit that
        demonstrates that the defendant is not a biomaterials supplier;
          (B) unless the court determines, to the extent raised in the
        pleadings and affidavits, that one or more of the following
        apply:
            (i) the defendant may be liable as a manufacturer, as
          provided in section 1604(b) of this title;
            (ii) the defendant may be liable as a seller, as provided
          in section 1604(c) of this title; or

          materials or component parts for the implant that failed to
          meet applicable contractual requirements or specifications,
          as provided in section 1604(d) of this title; or

          (C) if the claimant did not name the manufacturer as a party
        to the action, as provided in subsection (b) of this section.
      (4) Treatment of motion as motion for summary judgment
        The court may treat a motion to dismiss as a motion for summary
      judgment subject to subsection (d) of this section in order to
      determine whether the pleadings and affidavits, in connection
      with such action, raise genuine issues of material fact
      concerning whether the defendant furnished raw materials or
      component parts of the implant that failed to meet applicable
      contractual requirements or specifications as provided in section
      1604(d) of this title.
    (d) Summary judgment
      (1) In general
        (A) Basis for entry of judgment
          If a motion to dismiss of a biomaterials supplier is to be
        treated as a motion for summary judgment under subsection
        (c)(4) of this section or if a biomaterials supplier moves for
        summary judgment, the biomaterials supplier shall be entitled
        to entry of judgment without trial if the court finds there is
        no genuine issue of material fact for each applicable element
        set forth in paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 1604(d) of this
        title.
        (B) Issues of material fact
          With respect to a finding made under subparagraph (A), the
        court shall consider a genuine issue of material fact to exist
        only if the evidence submitted by the claimant would be
        sufficient to allow a reasonable jury to reach a verdict for
        the claimant if the jury found the evidence to be credible.
      (2) Discovery made prior to a ruling on a motion for summary
        judgment
        If, under applicable rules, the court permits discovery prior
      to a ruling on a motion for summary judgment governed by section
      1604(d) of this title, such discovery shall be limited solely to
      establishing whether a genuine issue of material fact exists as
      to the applicable elements set forth in paragraphs (1) and (2) of
      section 1604(d) of this title.
      (3) Discovery with respect to a biomaterials supplier
        A biomaterials supplier shall be subject to discovery in
      connection with a motion seeking dismissal or summary judgment on
      the basis of the inapplicability of section 1604(d) of this title
      or the failure to establish the applicable elements of section
      1604(d) of this title solely to the extent permitted by the
      applicable Federal or State rules for discovery against
      nonparties.
    (e) Dismissal with prejudice
      An order granting a motion to dismiss or for summary judgment
    pursuant to this section shall be entered with prejudice, except
    insofar as the moving defendant may be rejoined to the action as
    provided in section 1606 of this title.
    (f) Manufacturer conduct of litigation
      The manufacturer of an implant that is the subject of an action
    covered under this chapter shall be permitted to conduct litigation
    on any motion for summary judgment or dismissal filed by a
    biomaterials supplier who is a defendant under this section on
    behalf of such supplier if the manufacturer and any other defendant
    in such action enter into a valid and applicable contractual
    agreement under which the manufacturer agrees to bear the cost of
    such litigation or to conduct such litigation.

    Sec. 1606. Subsequent impleader of dismissed biomaterials supplier

-STATUTE-
    (a) Impleading of dismissed defendant
      A court, upon motion by a manufacturer or a claimant within 90
    days after entry of a final judgment in an action by the claimant
    against a manufacturer, and notwithstanding any otherwise
    applicable statute of limitations, may implead a biomaterials
    supplier who has been dismissed from the action pursuant to this
    chapter if - 
        (1) the manufacturer has made an assertion, either in a motion
      or other pleading filed with the court or in an opening or
      closing statement at trial, or as part of a claim for
      contribution or indemnification, and the court finds based on the
      court's independent review of the evidence contained in the
      record of the action, that under applicable law - 
          (A) the negligence or intentionally tortious conduct of the
        dismissed supplier was an actual and proximate cause of the
        harm to the claimant; and
          (B) the manufacturer's liability for damages should be
        reduced in whole or in part because of such negligence or
        intentionally tortious conduct; or

        (2) the claimant has moved to implead the supplier and the
      court finds, based on the court's independent review of the
      evidence contained in the record of the action, that under
      applicable law - 
          (A) the negligence or intentionally tortious conduct of the
        dismissed supplier was an actual and proximate cause of the
        harm to the claimant; and
          (B) the claimant is unlikely to be able to recover the full
        amount of its damages from the remaining defendants.
    (b) Standard of liability
      Notwithstanding any preliminary finding under subsection (a) of
    this section, a biomaterials supplier who has been impleaded into
    an action covered by this chapter, as provided for in this section -
     
        (1) may, prior to entry of judgment on the claim against it,
      supplement the record of the proceeding that was developed prior
      to the grant of the motion for impleader under subsection (a) of
      this section; and
        (2) may be found liable to a manufacturer or a claimant only to
      the extent required and permitted by any applicable State or
      Federal law other than this chapter.
    (c) Discovery
      Nothing in this section shall give a claimant or any other party
    the right to obtain discovery from a biomaterials supplier at any
    time prior to grant of a motion for impleader beyond that allowed
    under section 1605 of this title.

     EX. ORD. NO. 13165. WHITE HOUSE TASK FORCE ON DRUG USE IN SPORTS
        AND UNITED STATES REPRESENTATIVE ON THE BOARD OF THE WORLD
                            ANTI-DOPING AGENCY
      Ex. Ord. No. 13165, Aug. 9, 2000, 65 F.R. 49469, as amended by
    Ex. Ord. No. 13286, Sec. 11, Feb. 28, 2003, 68 F.R. 10622,
    provided:
      By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution
    and the laws of the United States of America, including the Office
    of National Drug Control [Policy] Reauthorization Act of 1998, (21
    U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), and in order to develop recommendations for
    Federal agency actions to address the use of drugs in sports, in
    particular among young people, it is hereby ordered as follows:
      Section 1. Policy. The use of drugs in sports has reached a level
    that endangers not just the legitimacy of athletic competition but
    also the lives and health of athletes - from the elite ranks to
    youth leagues. The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse issued
    in 1999 found that in just 1 year's time the rate of steroid use
    among young people rose roughly 50 percent among both sexes and
    across all age groups. It is the policy of my Administration to
    take the steps needed to help eliminate illicit or otherwise banned
    drug use and doping in sports at the State, national, and
    international level.
      Sec. 2. Establishment of a White House Task Force on Drug Use in
    Sports. (a) There is established a White House Task Force on Drug
    Use in Sports (Task Force). The Task Force shall comprise the co-
    vice chairs of the White House Olympic Task Force (the "Olympic
    Task Force Vice Chairs"), and representatives designated by the
    Office of National Drug Control Policy, the Department of Health
    and Human Services, the Department of Labor, the President's
    Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, the Office of Management
    and Budget, the National Security Council, the Department of State,
    the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Education, the
    Department of Justice, the Department of Transportation, the
    Department of Homeland Security, the National Institute on Drug
    Abuse, and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
    Administration.
      (b) The Task Force shall develop recommendations for the
    President on further executive and legislative actions that can be
    undertaken to address the problem of doping and drug use in sports.
    In developing the recommendations, the Task Force shall consider,
    among other things: (i) the health and safety of America's
    athletes, in particular our Nation's young people; (ii) the
    integrity of honest athletic competition; and (iii) the views and
    recommendations of State and local governments, the private sector,
    citizens, community groups, and nonprofit organizations, on actions
    to address this threat. The Task Force, through its Chairs, shall
    submit its recommendations to the President.
      (c) The Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy
    (the Director), the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human
    Services, and the Olympic Task Force Vice Chairs or their designees
    shall serve as the Task Force Chairs.
      (d) To the extent permitted by law and at the request of the
    Chairs, agencies shall cooperate with and provide information to
    the Task Force.
      Sec. 3. Participation in the World Anti-Doping Agency. (a) As
    part of my Administration's efforts to address the problem of drug
    use in sports, the United States has played a leading role in the
    formation of a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) by the Olympic and
    sports community and the nations of the world. Through these
    efforts, the United States has been selected to serve as a
    governmental representative on the board of the WADA. This order
    will authorize the Director to serve as the United States
    Government's representative on the WADA board.
      (b) Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 1701 et seq., the Director, or in his
    absence his designee, is hereby authorized to take all necessary
    and proper actions to execute his responsibilities as United States
    representative to the WADA.
      (c) To assist the Director in carrying out these responsibilities
    as the United States Government representative to the WADA and to
    the extent permitted by law, Federal employees may serve in their
    official capacity, inter alia, on WADA Committees or WADA advisory
    committees, serving as experts to the WADA.

      REPORT ON STREAMLINING FEDERAL PREVENTION AND TREATMENT EFFORTS

    Stat. 2681-758, expressed sense of Congress that efforts of the
    Federal Government to reduce demand for illegal drugs in United
    States are frustrated by fragmentation of those efforts across
    multiple departments and agencies, and improvement of those efforts
    can best be achieved through consolidation and coordination, and
    further provided that not later than 18 months after Oct. 21, 1998,
    Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy was to
    prepare and submit to Congress a report evaluating options for
    increasing efficacy of drug prevention and treatment programs,
    including a thorough review of activities and potential
    consolidation of existing Federal drug information clearinghouses.


-EXEC-
             EX. ORD. NO. 12880. NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL PROGRAM         
      Ex. Ord. No. 12880, Nov. 16, 1993, 58 F.R. 60989, as amended by
    Ex. Ord. No. 13008, June 3, 1996, 61 F.R. 28721, provided:
      The Office of National Drug Control Policy has the lead
    responsibility within the Executive Office of the President to
    establish policies, priorities, and objectives for the Nation's
    drug control program, with the goal of reducing the production,
    availability, and use of illegal drugs. All lawful and reasonable
    means must be used to ensure that the United States has a
    comprehensive and effective National Drug Control Strategy.
      Therefore, by the authority vested in me as President by the
    Constitution and the laws of the United States of America,
    including the National Narcotics Leadership Act of 1988, as amended
    (former 21 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.), and in order to provide for the
    effective management of the drug abuse policies of the United
    States, it is hereby ordered as follows:
      Section 1. General Provisions. (a) Because the United States
    considers the operations of international criminal narcotics
    syndicates as a national security threat requiring an extraordinary
    and coordinated response by civilian and military agencies involved
    in national security, the Director of the Office of National Drug
    Control Policy (Director), in his role as the principal adviser to
    the National Security Council on national drug control policy (50
    U.S.C. 402(f)), shall provide drug policy guidance and direction in
    the development of related national security programs.
      (b) The Director shall provide oversight and direction for all
    international counternarcotics policy development and
    implementation, in coordination with other concerned Cabinet
    members, as appropriate.
      (c) An Interagency Working Group (IWG) on international
    counternarcotics policy, chaired by the Office of National Drug
    Control Policy, shall develop and ensure coordinated implementation
    of an international counternarcotics policy. The IWG shall report
    its activities and differences of views among agencies to the
    Director for review, mediation, and resolution with concerned
    Cabinet members, and if necessary, by the President.
      (d) A coordinator for drug interdiction shall be designated by
    the Director to ensure that assets dedicated by Federal drug
    program agencies for interdiction are sufficient and that their use
    is properly integrated and optimized. The coordinator shall ensure
    that interdiction efforts and priorities are consistent with
    overall U.S. international counternarcotics policy.
      (e) The Director shall examine the number and structure of
    command/control and drug intelligence centers operated by drug
    control program agencies involved in international counter-
    narcotics and suggest improvements to the current structure for
    consideration by the President and concerned members of the
    Cabinet.
      (f) The Director, utilizing the services of the Drugs and Crime
    Data Center and Department of Justice Clearinghouse, shall assist
    in coordinating and enhancing the dissemination of statistics and
    studies relating to anti-drug abuse policy.
      (g) The Director shall provide advice to agencies regarding ways
    to achieve efficiencies in spending and improvements to interagency
    cooperation that could enhance the delivery of drug control
    treatment and prevention services to the public. The Director may
    request agencies to provide studies, information, and analyses in
    support of this order.
      Sec. 2. Goals, Direction, Duties and Responsibilities with
    Respect to the National Drug Control Program. (a) Budget Matters.
    (1) In addition to the budgetary authorities and responsibilities
    provided to the Director by statute, [former] 21 U.S.C. 1502, for
    those agency budget requests that are not certified as adequate to
    implement the objectives of the National Drug Control Strategy, the
    Director shall include in such certifications initiatives or
    funding levels that would make such requests adequate.
      (2) The Director shall provide, by July 1 of each year, budget
    recommendations to the heads of departments and agencies with
    responsibilities under the National Drug Control Program. The
    recommendations shall apply to the second following fiscal year and
    address funding priorities developed in the annual National Drug
    Control Strategy.
      (b) Measurement of National Drug Control Strategy Outcomes. (1)
    The National Drug Control Strategy shall include long-range goals
    for reducing drug use and the consequences of drug use in the
    United States, including burdens on hospital emergency rooms, drug
    use among arrestees, the extent of drug-related crime, high school
    dropout rates, the number of infants exposed annually to illicit
    drugs in utero, national drug abuse treatment capacity, and the
    annual national health care costs of drug use.
      (2) The National Drug Control Strategy shall also include an
    assessment of the quality of techniques and instruments to measure
    current drug use and supply and demand reduction activities, and
    the adequacy of the coverage of existing national drug use
    instruments and techniques to measure the total illicit drug user
    population and groups at-risk for drug use.
      (3) The Director shall coordinate an effort among the relevant
    drug control program agencies to assess the quality, access,
    management, effectiveness, and standards of accountability of drug
    abuse treatment, prevention, education, and other demand reduction
    activities.
      (c) Provision of Reports. To the extent permitted by law, heads
    of departments and agencies with responsibilities under the
    National Drug Control Program shall make available to the Office of
    National Drug Control Policy, appropriate statistics, studies, and
    reports, pertaining to Federal drug abuse control.
                                                     William J. Clinton.

    Sec. 1706. High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas Program

-STATUTE-
    (a) Establishment
      (1) In general
        There is established in the Office a program to be known as the
      High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas Program (in this section
      referred to as the "Program").
      (2) Purpose
        The purpose of the Program is to reduce drug trafficking and
      drug production in the United States by - 
          (A) facilitating cooperation among Federal, State, local, and
        tribal law enforcement agencies to share information and
        implement coordinated enforcement activities;
          (B) enhancing law enforcement intelligence sharing among
        Federal, State, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies;
          (C) providing reliable law enforcement intelligence to law
        enforcement agencies needed to design effective enforcement
        strategies and operations; and
          (D) supporting coordinated law enforcement strategies which
        maximize use of available resources to reduce the supply of
        illegal drugs in designated areas and in the United States as a
        whole.
    (b) Designation
      (1) In general
        The Director, in consultation with the Attorney General, the
      Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Homeland Security,
      heads of the National Drug Control Program agencies, and the
      Governor of each applicable State, may designate any specified
      area of the United States as a high intensity drug trafficking
      area.
      (2) Activities
        After making a designation under paragraph (1) and in order to
      provide Federal assistance to the area so designated, the
      Director may - 
          (A) obligate such sums as are appropriated for the Program;
          (B) direct the temporary reassignment of Federal personnel to
        such area, subject to the approval of the head of the
        department or agency that employs such personnel;
          (C) take any other action authorized under section 1703 of
        this title to provide increased Federal assistance to those
        areas; and
          (D) coordinate activities under this section (specifically
        administrative, recordkeeping, and funds management activities)
        with State, local, and tribal officials.
    (c) Petitions for designation
      The Director shall establish regulations under which a coalition
    of interested law enforcement agencies from an area may petition
    for designation as a high intensity drug trafficking area. Such
    regulations shall provide for a regular review by the Director of
    the petition, including a recommendation regarding the merit of the
    petition to the Director by a panel of qualified, independent
    experts.
    (d) Factors for consideration
      In considering whether to designate an area under this section as
    a high intensity drug trafficking area, the Director shall
    consider, in addition to such other criteria as the Director
    considers to be appropriate, the extent to which - 
        (1) the area is a significant center of illegal drug
      production, manufacturing, importation, or distribution;
        (2) State, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies have
      committed resources to respond to the drug trafficking problem in
      the area, thereby indicating a determination to respond
      aggressively to the problem;
        (3) drug-related activities in the area are having a
      significant harmful impact in the area, and in other areas of the
      country; and
        (4) a significant increase in allocation of Federal resources
      is necessary to respond adequately to drug-related activities in
      the area.
    (e) Organization of high intensity drug trafficking areas
      (1) Executive Board and officers
        To be eligible for funds appropriated under this section, each
      high intensity drug trafficking area shall be governed by an
      Executive Board. The Executive Board shall designate a chairman,
      vice chairman, and any other officers to the Executive Board that
      it determines are necessary.
      (2) Responsibilities
        The Executive Board of a high intensity drug trafficking area
      shall be responsible for - 
          (A) providing direction and oversight in establishing and

        the activities of the high intensity drug trafficking area.
      (3) Board representation
        None of the funds appropriated under this section may be
      expended for any high intensity drug trafficking area, or for a
      partnership or region of a high intensity drug trafficking area,
      if the Executive Board for such area, region, or partnership,
      does not apportion an equal number of votes between
      representatives of participating Federal agencies and
      representatives of participating State, local, and tribal
      agencies. Where it is impractical for an equal number of
      representatives of Federal agencies and State, local, and tribal
      agencies to attend a meeting of an Executive Board in person, the
      Executive Board may use a system of proxy votes or weighted votes
      to achieve the voting balance required by this paragraph.
      (4) No agency relationship
        The eligibility requirements of this section are intended to
      ensure the responsible use of Federal funds. Nothing in this
      section is intended to create an agency relationship between
      individual high intensity drug trafficking areas and the Federal
      Government.

      enforcement agencies in investigations and activities related to
      terrorism and prevention of terrorism, especially but not
      exclusively with respect to such investigations and activities
      that are also related to drug trafficking.
      (2) Limitation
        The Director shall ensure - 
          (A) that assistance provided under paragraph (1) remains
        incidental to the purpose of the Program to reduce drug
        availability and carry out drug-related law enforcement
        activities; and
          (B) that significant resources of the Program are not
        redirected to activities exclusively related to terrorism,

      Pub. L. 109-469, title III, Sec. 302(b), Dec. 29, 2006, 120 Stat.
    3524, provided that: "Congress finds the following:
        "(1) In the early morning hours of October 16, 2002, the home
      of Carnell and Angela Dawson was firebombed in apparent
      retaliation for Mrs. Dawson's notification to police about
      persistent drug distribution activity in their East Baltimore
      City neighborhood.
        "(2) The arson claimed the lives of Mr. and Mrs. Dawson and
      their 5 young children, aged 9 to 14.
        "(3) The horrific murder of the Dawson family is a stark
      example of domestic narco-terrorism.
        "(4) In all phases of counternarcotics law enforcement - from
      prevention to investigation to prosecution to reentry - the
      voluntary cooperation of ordinary citizens is a critical
      component.
        "(5) Voluntary cooperation is difficult for law enforcement
      officials to obtain when citizens feel that cooperation carries
      the risk of violent retaliation by illegal drug trafficking
      organizations and their affiliates.
        "(6) Public confidence that law enforcement is doing all it can
      to make communities safe is a prerequisite for voluntary
      cooperation among people who may be subject to intimidation or
      reprisal (or both).
        "(7) Witness protection programs are insufficient on their own
      to provide security because many individuals and families who
      strive every day to make distressed neighborhoods livable for
      their children, other relatives, and neighbors will resist or
      refuse offers of relocation by local, State, and Federal
      prosecutorial agencies and because, moreover, the continued
      presence of strong individuals and families is critical to
      preserving and strengthening the social fabric in such
      communities.
        "(8) Where (as in certain sections of Baltimore City)
      interstate trafficking of illegal drugs has severe ancillary
      local consequences within areas designated as high intensity drug
      trafficking areas, it is important that supplementary High
      Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas Program funds be committed to
      support initiatives aimed at making the affected communities safe
      for the residents of those communities and encouraging their
      cooperation with tribal, local, State, and Federal law
      enforcement efforts to combat illegal drug trafficking."

      2001 through 2004.
      "(c) Apportionment of Funds. - 
        "(1) Factors in apportionment. - The Director shall apportion
      amounts appropriated for a fiscal year pursuant to the
      authorization of appropriations in subsection (b) for activities
      under subsection (a) among and within areas designated by the
      Director as high intensity drug trafficking areas based on the

        chemicals (as that term is defined in section 102(33) of the
        Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 802(33)) seized by
        Federal, State, or local law enforcement officials in the
        previous fiscal year.
          "(E) Intelligence and predictive data from the Drug
        Enforcement Administration and the Department of Health and
        Human Services showing patterns and trends in abuse,
        trafficking, and transportation in methamphetamine,
        amphetamine, and listed chemicals (as that term is so defined).
        "(2) Certification. - Before the Director apportions any funds
      under this subsection to a high intensity drug trafficking area,
      the Director shall certify that the law enforcement entities
      responsible for clandestine methamphetamine and amphetamine
      laboratory seizures in that area are providing laboratory seizure
      data to the national clandestine laboratory database at the El
      Paso Intelligence Center.
      "(d) Limitation on Administrative Costs. - Not more than 5
    percent of the amount appropriated in a fiscal year pursuant to the
    authorization of appropriations for that fiscal year in subsection
    (b) may be available in that fiscal year for administrative costs
    associated with activities under subsection (a)."

    (j) Prevention of marijuana use
      (1) Findings
        The Congress finds the following:
          (A) 60 percent of adolescent admissions for drug treatment
        are based on marijuana use.
          (B) Potency levels of contemporary marijuana, particularly
        hydroponically grown marijuana, are significantly higher than
        in the past, rising from under 1 percent of THC in the mid-
        1970s to as high as 30 percent today.
          (C) Contemporary research has demonstrated that youths
        smoking marijuana early in life may be up to 5 times more
        likely to use hard drugs.
          (D) Contemporary research has demonstrated clear detrimental
        effects in adolescent educational achievement resulting from
        marijuana use.
          (E) Contemporary research has demonstrated clear detrimental
        effects in adolescent brain development resulting from
        marijuana use.
          (F) An estimated 9,000,000 Americans a year drive while under
        the influence of illegal drugs, including marijuana.
          (G) Marijuana smoke contains 50 to 70 percent more of certain
        cancer causing chemicals than tobacco smoke.
          (H) Teens who use marijuana are up to 4 times more likely to
        have a teen pregnancy than teens who have not.
          (I) Federal law enforcement agencies have identified clear
        links suggesting that trade in hydroponic marijuana facilitates
        trade by criminal organizations in hard drugs, including
        heroin.
          (J) Federal law enforcement agencies have identified possible
        links between trade in cannabis products and financing for
        terrorist organizations.
      (2) Emphasis on prevention of youth marijuana use
        In conducting advertising and activities otherwise authorized
      under this section, the Director may emphasize prevention of
      youth marijuana use.
    (k) Prevention of methamphetamine abuse and other emerging drug
      abuse threats
      (1) Requirement to use 10 percent of funds for methamphetamine
        abuse prevention
        The Director shall ensure that, of the amounts appropriated
      under this section for the national media campaign for a fiscal
      year, not less than 10 percent shall be expended solely for the
      activities described in subsection (b)(1) with respect to
      advertisements specifically intended to reduce the use of
      methamphetamine.
      (2) Authority to use funds for other drug abuse upon
        certification that methamphetamine abuse fell during fiscal
        year 2007
        With respect to fiscal year 2008 and any fiscal year
      thereafter, if the Director certifies in writing to Congress that
      domestic methamphetamine laboratory seizures (as reported to the
      El Paso Intelligence Center of the Drug Enforcement
      Administration) decreased to at least 75 percent of the 2006
      level, or the Director has documented a highly, statistically
      significant increase in a specific drug, from a baseline
      determined by locally collected data, that can be defined as a
      local drug crisis, the Director may apply paragraph (1)(A) for
      that fiscal year with respect to advertisements specifically
      intended to reduce the use of such other drugs.
    (l) Authorization of appropriations
      There is authorized to be appropriated to the Office to carry out
    this section, $195,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2007 and 2008

    Sec. 1901. Findings and policy

-STATUTE-
    (a) Findings
      Congress makes the following findings:
        (1) Presidential Decision Directive 42, issued on October 21,
      1995, ordered agencies of the executive branch of the United
      States Government to, inter alia, increase the priority and
      resources devoted to the direct and immediate threat
      international crime presents to national security, work more
      closely with other governments to develop a global response to
      this threat, and use aggressively and creatively all legal means
      available to combat international crime.
        (2) Executive Order No. 12978 of October 21, 1995, provides for
      the use of the authorities in the International Emergency
      Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) to target
      and apply sanctions to four international narcotics traffickers
      and their organizations that operate from Colombia.
        (3) IEEPA was successfully applied to international narcotics
      traffickers in Colombia and based on that successful case study,
      Congress believes similar authorities should be applied
      worldwide.
        (4) There is a national emergency resulting from the activities
      of international narcotics traffickers and their organizations
      that threatens the national security, foreign policy, and economy
      of the United States.
    (b) Policy
      It shall be the policy of the United States to apply economic and
    other financial sanctions to significant foreign narcotics
    traffickers and their organizations worldwide to protect the
    national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States
    from the threat described in subsection (a)(4) of this section.
