1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>
<tt>MATHPHA</tt> takes  a  user-defined  input  expression  representing    
mathematical  operations  to  be  performed  on  (one  or  more) PHA    
datasets. The input  expression  is  thus  allowed  to  contain  PHA    
filenames  (and  optionally,  an  extension  number),  a  number  of    
mathematical  operators,  integers,  reals,  and  pairs  of   curved    
brackets  ("("  &amp; ")"). Assuming the expression is able to be parsed (and
a number of  other  criteria  are  satisfied),  the  operations specified 
are  performed  on the PHA dataset, the errors propagated 
(see Section&nbsp;<a href="#Sec:errors">3</a>), 
and a new file containing the resultant PHA dataset is written.

<p>
The units in which the algebra is performed is controlled        
by a parameter (<tt>units</tt>; see Section&nbsp;<a href="#Sec:units">2</a>), 
the default of which is COUNTS        
(as  opposed  to  COUNTS  PER  SECOND). This is true 
<b>IRRESPECTIVE</b> of        
whether the original PHA data themselves are  stored  as  counts  or        
counts  per  second.  The  exposure  time  written  for  the new PHA        
dataset is controlled by a user-defined parameter (<tt>exposure</tt>;  
see Section&nbsp;<a href="#Sec:exposure">4</a>). Users also have the option of specifying 
the values written to the o/p file of several other mandatory keywords
(see Section&nbsp;<a href="#Sec:auxfiles">6</a>).

<p>
<b>Users should note</b> that <tt>MATHPHA</tt> is  a  moderately  powerful tool,
and thus  open  to confusion/abuse. Users are strongly urged  to  read  &amp; 
attempt  to fully  understand  the  deatils of the task.
In  particular,  users  should understand the implied units for any
integers/reals which form  part of  the  input expression, the details of the
error propagation, and options available to calculate the exposure time
written to the  o/p file.  Both  of  these  issues  are  discussed  in detail
below. Any remaining   confusion/uncertainties/strange   results   should   
be reported to the author.

<p>
At  the  current  time,  only  a  modest  number  of  mathematical        
operations are possible (as listed 
in Section&nbsp;<a href="#Sec:supported">2.1</a>), though it is  anticipated        
that  they  will serve the vast majority of users' needs. These will        
be added to as dictated by demand. In addition, due to the  relative        
crudeness  of the expression parser, there are number of rules which        
users must conform to when constructing their input expression 
(Section&nbsp;<a href="#Sec:units">2</a>).   
Violation   of   these  rules  will  result  in  the  task        
(hopefully)  stopping,  (possibly)  crashing,  or   (maybe   even)        
producing incorrect results.                                                

<p>
Only  the the OGIP recognised PHA file formats described in 
<a href="/docs/heasarc/ofwg/docs/spectra/ogip_92_007/ogip_92_007.html">OGIP/92-007</a>

<p>
(see also Arnaud etal 1992)
and its appendix  provided  in  OGIP  memo        
<a href="/docs/heasarc/ofwg/docs/spectra/ogip_92_007a/ogip_92_007a.html">OGIP/92-007a</a>
are supported for both the input and output files.             

<p>
 <h2><a name="tth_sEc2">
2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;RULES GOVERNING THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE INPUT EXPRESSION</h2>
<a name="Sec:units">
</a>

<p>
The  input  expression  is  a  character  string (currently with a        
maximum length  of  1024  characters)  which  forms  a  mathematical        
expression consisting of:                                                   

<p>

<ul>
<li>    PHA filenames<br />
            Only  the  &#246;bvious"  restrictions  are  currently placed on        
        filenames, namely that the path must be specified, and that  the        
        parser  must  not  be  able  to interpret the path/filename as a        
        mathematical operation, an  integer/real,  or  some  combination        
        thereof  (this  currently  poses a problem under unix &amp; ultrix -
        see below). A specific extension of the  input  file  containing        
        the  PHA dataset to be operated on can be specified by including        
        the integer extension number in  square  (<tt>[</tt>extn#<tt>]</tt>)  
	brackets        
        after  the  filename.  If such a specification is not used, then        
        the entire PHA file will be searched for  extensions  likely  to        
        contain  a PHA dataset. In such cases, if the input file is then        
        found to consist of more than one PHA  dataset,  then  the  task        
        will warn the user and stop.                                            
	
<ul>
<li>		At  the  current  time,  up to 10 filenames can be specified        
        within the input expression (within the constraint of the  total        
        number   of   characters  specified  above).  Within  the  above        
        limitation on the number of filenames, a given i/p filename  can        
        feature any number of times within the input expression.<p></li>
</ul><p></li>

<li>    Allowed mathematical operations<br />
            The  mathematical  operators  currently  allowed  are listed        
        in Section&nbsp;<a href="#Sec:supported">2.1</a>. 
	Any character which is not in this list, is not a  curved        
        bracket,  and  which  cannot  be  interpreted  as  (part  of) an        
        integer/real,  will  be  interpreted  as  a  filename,  or  part        
        thereof.                                                                
	
<ul>
<li>	Users  should  adhere  to  standard mathematical conventions        
        when  constructing  the  input   expression   to   ensure   that        
        operations  are  carried  out in the desired order. It should be        
        noted that in the case of a  'sub-expression'  consisting  of  a        
        series   of   multiplication   and/or   division  operations  on        
        filenames   and/or   numerical   constants   (ie    where    the        
        sub-expression  does  not  contain  either  
	<tt>+</tt>, <tt>-</tt>, <tt>(</tt> or <tt>)</tt>        
        characters), these operations will be carried out  working  from        
        left-to-right.  Thus the sub-expression 
	<tt>4/2*6</tt> will result in a        
        value of <tt>12</tt>.<p></li>

<li>
            At the current time, the input expression  can  include  any        
        number  of mathematical operations (within the constraint of the        
        total number of characters specified above).<p></li>

<li>
            <b>NOTE</b> currently,  a  mathematical  operator  is  
	<b>NOT</b>
        allowed  to  immediately  follow a <tt>(</tt> 
	character, or immediately        
        preceed a <tt>)</tt> character in the input expression.<p></li>
</ul><p></li>

<li>    Numerical constants (reals and/or integers)<br />
            Numerical  constants  consist  of  a  combination  of  ASCII        
        characters  in  the  range  <tt>0</tt>  to  <tt>9</tt> along with 
	an optional,        
        single decimal point (<tt>.</tt>). For internal  purposes,  the  
	parser        
        interprets  all  integers as reals, thus the inclusion/exclusion        
        of the decimal point for whole numbers is of no consequence.            
	
<ul>
<li>		It is <b>IMPERATIVE</b> 
	that users remember that the units  of  any        
        numerical  constants  added  to or subtracted from a PHA dataset        
        assumed to be in the units specified by  the  parameter  
	<tt>units</tt>        
        (the  default  of  which  is COUNTS; see Section&nbsp;<a href="#Sec:parameters">8</a>),
	<b>IRRESPECTIVE</b> of        
        whether the original PHA data themselves are  stored  as  counts        
        or counts per second.<p></li>

<li>
	At  the  current  time, the input expression can include any        
        number of numerical constants  (within  the  constraint  of  the        
        total number of characters specified above).<p></li>

<li>
            <b>NOTE</b>  at  the  current  time  numerals of the form        
        <tt>1E04</tt> or <tt>1E-04</tt> are <b>NOT</b> 
	supported (and will be interpreted  as        
        input  filenames).  This shortfall will be addressed in the near        
        future.<p></li>
</ul><p></li>

<li>    Matching pairs of curved brackets (parentheses)<br />
            Curved brackets should be used in the standard  mathematical        
        mannor  to denote the priority in which various calculations are        
        performed. For safety, the task  will  stop  if  the  number  of        
        open-brackets    (<tt>(</tt>)    does   not   equal   the   number   
	of        
        close-brackets(<tt>)</tt>). 
	The only  limitations  currently  in  place        
        are  that  neither  the  first  nor  last entry within a pair of        
        brackets is a mathematical operator,  in  which  case  the  task        
        <i>SHOULD</i> stop.
	
<ul>
<li>            At  the  current  time,  up  to  10 pairs of brackets may be        
        included within the input expression.<p></li>
</ul><p></li>
</ul>

<p>
Within the constraint of the total number  of  characters  specified        
above, any number of spaces can be added to the input expression.           

<p>
                                                                                     <h3><a name="tth_sEc2.1">
2.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently Supported Mathematical Operations</h3>
<a name="Sec:supported">
</a>

<p>
The following mathematical operations are currently supported:

<ul>
<li>    addition (<tt>+</tt>)<p></li>

<li>    subtraction (<tt>-</tt>)<p></li>

<li>    multiplication (<tt>*</tt>)<p></li>

<li>    division (<tt>/</tt>)<p></li>
</ul>

<p>
It  should be noted that the parser will interpret all characters        
besides   those   listed   above   and   the    open/close    curved        
brackets/parentheses  characters  (ie  <tt>(</tt>  and  <tt>)</tt>)  
as (parts of) input PHA filenames.

<p>
 <h2><a name="tth_sEc3">
3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;CALCULATION &amp; PROGATION OF ERRORS</h2>
<a name="Sec:errors">
</a> 

<p>
   There several options open to users regarding the calculation or
propagation of errors, controlled by the parameters <tt>errmeth</tt> and 
<tt>properr</tt>.

<p>
   The (hidden) parameter <tt>errmeth</tt> controls which prescription is used to
calculate errors, should the task need to do so. The value of this keyword
is therefore important if the errors are to be propagated 
(ie <tt>properr='yes'</tt>)
and one or more of the i/p files contain the FITS
keyword <tt>POISERR = T</tt> indicating Poissonian statistics should be used to
calculate the statistical errors, or if errors are not to be propagated
(ie <tt>properr='no'</tt>) and the algebra is performed in counts/sec 
(ie <tt>units='Rate'</tt>).

<p>
Currently, the following prescriptions are available (where <tt>N</tt> 
is the number of counts observed in a given PHA channel):

<ul>
<li>	<tt>errmeth = 'Gauss'</tt><br />
	whereby the errors are calculated using 
	<tt>error</tt> = &#8730;{<tt>N</tt>}.<p></li>

<li>	<tt>errmeth = 'POISS-1'</tt><br />
	(the default) whereby the algorithm of Gehrels (1986 ApJ, 303, 336)
	eqn 7 with S=1 is used
	(<tt>error</tt> = 1.0 + &#8730;{<tt>N</tt> + 0.75}).
	The value is statistically that of the (larger) +ve error of a 
	Poissonian distribution, but within this task this value is 
	assigned to both the +ve and -ve error on the counts in that channel. 
	For small <tt>N</tt>, the errors created using this prescription is 
	significantly <b>GREATER</b> (and hence more conservative) than
	both the true -ve error, and that obtained by simply using 
	&#8730;{<tt>N</tt>}. Thus, this prescription is recommended unless a 
	user fully understands the implications of using a different 
	prescription. Both differences quickly reduce as one moves to 
	larger <tt>N</tt> (and the Poissonian distribution becomes more
	symmetric/Gaussian).<p></li>

<li>	<tt>errmeth = 'POISS-2'</tt><br />
	whereby the algorithm of Gehrels (1986 ApJ, 303, 336) eqn 11,
	with S=1 is used
	(<tt>error</tt> = &#8730;{<tt>N</tt> &#8722; 0.25}).
	The value is statistically that of the (smaller) -ve error of a 
	Poissonian distribution, but within this task this value is 
	assigned to both the +ve and -ve error on the counts in that channel. 
	This error prescription <b>UNDERESTIMATES</b> the true error for small 
	<tt>N</tt>.<p></li>

<li>	<tt>errmeth = 'POISS-3'</tt><br />
	whereby the mean of the errors given by <tt>POISS-1</tt> and 
	<tt>POISS-2</tt> above is used.<p></li>
</ul>
Caution is urged, particularly when using <tt>errmeth = 'Gauss'</tt>, as 
unexpected and/or misleading results can be produced.

<p>
<font size="+0">   The (hidden) parameter <tt>properr</tt> controls whether the errors are to be
propagated during the algebra or (if <tt>properr='no'</tt>) whether the errors are
simply calculated from the resultant PHA dataset. In the former case,
the errors are propagated in the normal manner
(e<sub>3</sub> = &#8730;{[e<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> + e<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>]}). 
This is an approximation when in the Poissonian regime (ie for low <tt>N</tt>). 
Whilst it
is true that the variances of the Poissonian distribution are combined in
this normal way, confidence limit error bars are not simply related to the
variance like they are for Gaussian statistics.

<p>
HOWEVER, these approximations work well for all but the smallest <tt>N</tt>, 
and is certainly superior to either assuming 
&#8730;{<tt>N</tt>} errors, or neglecting
errors altogther:

<ul>
<li>	For example, adding two PHA datasets each with 
	<tt>N=5</tt> counts in a              
    given channel will give a value of <tt>10</tt>, and errors of:<br />
   	<tt>+4.24   -4.24</tt>   (using <tt>errmeth='POISS-1'</tt>)
   	<tt>+3.08   -3.08</tt>   (using <tt>errmeth='POISS-2'</tt>)
   	<tt>+3.95   -3.95</tt>   (using <tt>errmeth='POISS-3'</tt>)
    compared to:<br />

       <tt>+3.16   -3.16</tt>   (propagating 'Gaussian' errors)<p></li>
</ul>

<p>
   Severely misleading and/or incorrect results are possible if the errors
are not propagated (ie if <tt>properr=no</tt>). Turning off error propagation
is only reccomended when one is adding non-background-subtracted datasets,
and one fully understands the risks.

<p>
The  value  written  as the exposure time in the o/p PHA dataset is        
indicated  by  a  user-defined  flag  (<tt>exposure</tt>).  
This   facility        
provides  added  flexibility  to  users,  but  with  a  risk of some

<p>
      The  area  scaling  factor  is  a numerical constant stored in the        
    OGIP-mandatory FITS keyword <tt>AREASCAL</tt> in the 
	<tt>SPECTRUM</tt> extension of  a        
    PHA  file.  Details  of  its  use  (and  misuse)  are too varied and        
    complex to be fully described here, but most often  it  is  used  to        
    renormalize  the  response  matrix  associated  with  that  PHA file        
    within <tt>XSPEC</tt>. 
	As such the value of the  <tt>AREASCAL</tt>  keyword  is  often        
    unity,  but  (particularly  in  the case of older response matrices)        
    can have values of the order of the effective area (in cm<sup>2</sup>) of  
	the telescope/instrument. 

<p>
 The value written as the <tt>AREASCAL</tt> keyword in the o/p PHA dataset is
determined by a hidden parameter, <tt>areascal</tt>. 
The following options are currently available:

<ul>
<li>	<tt>areascal = 'NULL'</tt><br />

<li>	<tt>areascal =</tt> <i>i/p filename</i><br />
    	whereby the <tt>AREASCAL</tt> read from the specified i/p file is written
	to the o/p dataset.<p></li>

<li>	<tt>areascal =</tt> <i>real</i><br />
    	where the entered value (assuming it can be parsed as a real), is
	written to the o/p dataset. At the current time, numerals of the 
        form  <tt>1E04</tt>  or  <tt>1E-04</tt>  are  <b>NOT</b>  supported  
	(and   will   be interpreted as i/p filenames).<p></li>

<li>	<tt>areascal = '%'</tt><br />
	 (the default setting) where <tt>MATHPHA</tt> 
	employs the following logic:

<ul>
<li>	if the values of the AREASCAL keywords in the all the i/p files:
	
<ul>
<li>	AGREE to within 1%<br />
         this value (actually the straight mean) will be written to the         
        o/p file.<p></li>

<li>	DISAGREE by more than 1%<br />
         the user is informed of the various values encounted in the            
        i/p files,  an <tt>AREASCAL</tt> of unity is written to the o/p file,
        and the user invited  to determine and change the value of this         
        keyword outside of <tt>MATHPHA</tt>.<p></li>

In both cases, the user is informed of the value written to the o/p

Essentially, if you dont see warning messages regarding <tt>AREASCAL</tt>
during execution, don't worry about it. If you do, and the values           
on the various i/p files vary dramatically and you dont understand

 <h2><a name="tth_sEc6">
6</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;DETERMINATION OF THE AUXILIARY FILES FOR THE O/P PHA DATASET</h2>
<a name="Sec:auxfiles">
</a>

<p>
There are a number of mandatory keywords required to be present in the 
header of extension containing the resultant PHA dataset in the o/p file.
A number of these are crucial for the correct interpretation of the 
o/p dataset. 
The prime example is the value of the <tt>EXPOSURE</tt> keyword, and 
as described in Section&nbsp;<a href="#Sec:exposure">4</a>, <tt>MATHPHA</tt> has a 
parameter <tt>exposure</tt> which controls how the value to be written to 
the o/p file is determined.
Similarly <tt>MATHPHA</tt> compares the values of the <tt>AREASCAL</tt> 
keywords found in the i/p files, and attempts to determine the most 
appropriate value to be written to the o/p file
(Section&nbsp;<a href="#Sec:areascal">5</a>). 
<tt>MATHPHA</tt> 
also checks the 
values of the <tt>TELESCOP</tt>, <tt>INSTRUME</tt>, <tt>DETNAM</tt>,
<tt>FILTER</tt> &amp; <tt>CHANTYPE</tt> keywords. If there are 
discrepancies with any of these keywords, <tt>MATHPHA</tt> 
will warn the user and writes the appropriate null/default value to
the o/p file.

<p>
However, there are a number of mandatory keywords associated with 
'auxiliary' files, for which <tt>MATHPHA</tt> is in general unable to 
calculate 'appropriate' values (since it largely depends upon what 
the user is attempting to do via the input expression).
These keywords are:

<ul>
<li>	<tt>BACKFILE</tt> - the name of the corresponding PHA file containing
	the appropriate background spectrum (if any)<p></li>

<li>	<tt>BACKSCAL</tt> - the numerical scaling which should be applied 
	to the background spectrum (as specified by the <tt>BACKFILE</tt>
	keyword) before background-subtraction.<p></li>

<li>	<tt>CORRFILE</tt> - the name of the corresponding PHA file containing
	the appropriate correction spectrum (if any)<p></li>

<li>	<tt>CORRSCAL</tt> - the numerical scaling which should be applied 
	to the correction spectrum (as specified by the <tt>CORRFILE</tt>
	keyword).<p></li>

<li>	<tt>RESPFILE</tt> - the name of the redistribution matrix 
	(aka RMF) appropriate to the PHA dataset<p></li>

<li>	<tt>ANCRFILE</tt> - the name of the ancillary response dataset
	(aka ARF) appropriate to the PHA dataset, to be use in conjuction 
	with the redistribution matrix given by the 
	 <tt>RESPFILE</tt> keyword.<p></li>
</ul>
(see also 
<a href="/docs/heasarc/ofwg/docs/spectra/ogip_92_007/ogip_92_007.html">OGIP/92-007).</a>

<p>
However, for convenience <tt>MATHPHA</tt> does provide users some
opportunity to specify the values to be written to the o/p
file via the hidden parameters
<tt>auxfiles</tt>, <tt>backfile</tt>, <tt>backscal</tt>, <tt>corrfile</tt>,
<tt>corrscal</tt>, <tt>arfile</tt> and <tt>rmfile</tt>
(see also Section&nbsp;<a href="#Sec:parameters">8</a>).
The internal logic for <tt>MATHPHA</tt> regarding these parameters is as
follows:

<ol type="1">
<li>	If the <tt>auxfiles</tt>, <tt>backfile</tt>, <tt>backscal</tt>, 
	<tt>corrfile</tt>,
	<tt>corrscal</tt>, <tt>arfile</tt> &amp; <tt>rmfile</tt> parameters 
	all have their 
	default value (<tt>'NONE'</tt>), then the null/default values of 
	the <tt>BACKFILE</tt>, <tt>BACKSCAL</tt>, <tt>CORRFILE</tt>, <tt>CORRSCAL</tt>, 
	<tt>RESPFILE</tt> and <tt>ANCRFILE</tt> keywords will be written to 
	the o/p file. The o/p file will thus have the same values for these 
	keywords as obtained using versions of <tt>MATHPHA</tt> earlier than 
	<tt>v3.5.0</tt>.<p></li>

<li>	If the <tt>auxfiles</tt> parameter is set to one of the files 
	in the i/p expression, then values of 
	the <tt>BACKFILE</tt>, <tt>BACKSCAL</tt>, <tt>CORRFILE</tt>, <tt>CORRSCAL</tt>,
        <tt>RESPFILE</tt> and <tt>ANCRFILE</tt> keywords written to the o/p 
	file will be taken (<i>ie</i> copied) from the specified i/p file
	(or set to their null/default values if there is a problem).
	It should be noted that setting the <tt>auxfiles</tt> parameter 
	overrides any values specified via the 
	<tt>backfile</tt>, <tt>backscal</tt>, <tt>corrfile</tt>,
        <tt>corrscal</tt>, <tt>arfile</tt> &amp; <tt>rmfile</tt> parameters
	such that any values will be ignored.<p></li>

<li>	If the <tt>auxfiles</tt> parameter is not set (has a value <tt>'NONE'</tt>),
	then if any/all the parmeters 
	<tt>backfile</tt>, <tt>backscal</tt>, <tt>corrfile</tt>,
        <tt>corrscal</tt>, <tt>arfile</tt> &amp; <tt>rmfile</tt> 
	are set to any of the files in the i/p expression, then values of
	the corresponding keyword(s) written to the o/p file 
	will be taken (<i>ie</i> <b>COPIED</b>) from the specified i/p file
        (or set to their null/default values if there is a problem).
	At the current time, unfortuantely one <b>CANNOT</b> specify 
	the name of (say) the response matrix to be written as the 
	value of the <tt>RESPFILE</tt> keyword via the parameter 
	<tt>rmfile</tt> - one can only specify the i/p PHA from which 
	the <tt>RESPFILE</tt> is to copied to the o/p file.<p></li>

7</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;WARNINGS ON USAGE</h2>

<p>
The parser is written in FORTRAN (!), and converts the                    
user-supplied expression to &#207;MG" Reverse Polish (a little-known            
dialect thought to be understood by but one person on the planet).          
The parser attempts to identify the various elements of the input           
expression, and order the mathematical operations and the reading           
of PHA datasets appropriately. The parser attempts to work out from         
the last-entered (innermost) bracket-pair.  The mathematical                
expression contained therewithin is evaluated and the answer                
stored. The parser then moves to the 2nd-to-last bracket-pair. The          
mathematical expression contained therewithin is evaluated                  
(including the results already calculated, if appropriate), and the         
answer again stored.  This process thus continues until the full            
expression has been evaluated, and this is the result which is              
finally written as the output PHA dataset.                                  

<p>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc7.1">
7.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Common Mistakes/Limitations</h3>

<p>
Users should keep in mind the following constraints/behaviour:            

<ul>
<li> 	At the current time, unix/ultrix users will to encounter severe
	problems if they attempt to specify the path to PHA datasets (not
	in the current directory): namely that the parser will interpret an
	input expression of the form:<br />
	<tt>expr = directory1/directory2/filename</tt><br />
	 to divide the  PHA  file        
	    called  <tt>'directory1'</tt>  by  PHA  file  <tt>'directory2'</tt>,  
	then  divide the        
	result by PHA file <tt>'filename'</tt>. 
	This problem may be  addressed  in  a        
	future  release of the task, however can be overcome in the 
	meantime        
	by copying the necessary input PHA file(s) to  the  current  
	working directory.<p></li>

<li>
<b>BUG:</b>
    Due to the current lack of a unit-string parser, the  units  of  the        
    output  file  will  always  be  either <tt>'count'</tt> or 
	<tt>'count/s'</tt>. This is        
    true   even   in   cases   such    as 
	<tt>"expr='file1/file2'"</tt>,    or        
    <tt>"expr='file1*file2'"</tt>.  
	This is a bug which can lead to confusion, and a parser is        
    being worked on.<p></li>

<li>    At the current time numerals of the form <tt>1E04</tt> or 
	<tt>1E-04</tt> are <b>NOT</b>          
        supported (and will be interpreted as input filenames).<p></li>

<li>    When a PHA dataset be either multiplied or divided by a numerical
        constant,  the  errors  are  calculated  such  as  to  keep  the        
        fractional error in the derived dataset equal  to  that  in  the        
        i/p dataset.<p></li>
</ul> 

<p>
The task will <b>STOP</b> (hopefully with an appropriate error message)        
if:                                                                         

<ul>
<li>    The output file has an illegal name. For safety, under no
        circumstances can the o/p filename be the same  as  one  of  the        
        i/p  filenames.  Under unix/ultrix, the task will also stop if a        
        file of the same name already exists in the  current  directory,        
        and the output file is NOT preceeded by <tt>"!"</tt> (see below).<p></li>

<li>	All the PHA files in the i/p expression do not have the 
	same number of raw detector channels (as specified by the 
	<tt>DETCHANS</tt> keyword in the i/p files).<p></li>

<li> 	This  task  is not designed to replace pocket/on-line calculators,
	and (currently) will stop if the parser is unable to find something
	resembling a potential PHA filename within the entire input
	expression.<p></li>
</ul> 

<p>
Users  who  encounter/suspect problems with the task are urged to        
contact  the  author,  but  also  to  experiment  with   the   input        
expression   (by   increasing/moving   pairs   of  brackets,  and/or        
performing the required calculation with two or more passes  through        
<tt>MATHPHA</tt>).

        the  algebra  will  be  performed  in  'COUNTS'  and 'COUNTS PER        
         SECOND' space respectively. The algebra will  be  performed  in        
        this  space   irrespective  of  whether  the input files contain        
        data  stored  in  counts  or   in  counts  per  second  (ie,  if

	will be        
        converted to counts prior to any mathematical operations   being

        4)  to  be added by the user. <tt>ncomments = 0</tt> 
	is allowed for users        
        not wishing to add their own notes. The default value is 1.<p></li>

<li>	<tt>commentn [character string]</tt><br />
        The i/p parameters, including the expression,  will  be  written        
        as  <tt>COMMENTS</tt> to the o/p file; 
	these additional comments provide        
        users the facility to add their own notes. Each string  will  be        
        truncated beyond the 70th character.<p></li>

<li>	<tt>(auxfiles = 'NONE') [character string]</tt><br />
	A flag indicating whether the values of <b>ALL</b> the 
	auxiliary file keywords 
	(<tt>BACKFILE</tt>, <tt>BACKSCAL</tt>, <tt>CORRFILE</tt>, <tt>CORRSCAL</tt>,
        <tt>RESPFILE</tt> &amp; <tt>ANCRFILE</tt>) written to the o/p 
	file are to be copied from a user-specified i/p file.
	The default value (<tt>'NONE'</tt>) indicates this is not the 
	case, and will result in these keywords being written with 
	their null/default values in the o/p file
	(see Section&nbsp;<a href="#Sec:auxfiles">6</a>).
	It should be remembered that setting the <tt>auxfiles</tt> parameter 
	overrides any values specified via the 
	<tt>backfile</tt>, <tt>backscal</tt>, <tt>corrfile</tt>,
        <tt>corrscal</tt>, <tt>arfile</tt> &amp; <tt>rmfile</tt> parameters

 		The default value (<tt>NONE</tt>) 
		for this keyword will be written in the o/p file<p></li>

<li>	<tt>backfile='%'</tt><br />
	 	The task will check whether all the i/p PHA files have the same
 		value of the <tt>BACKFILE</tt> keyword.

        same  name  as that  requested as the output file from this task        
        will be overwritten. This parameter is required to be present 
        by the FTOOLS group and NASA/GSFC and provides the same functionality 
        as that described above whereby the o/p filename can be preceeded 
	by <tt>"!"</tt> at the <tt>outfil</tt> prompt. It should be noted that 
	the <tt>"!"</tt><i>filename</i> syntax will overwrite any existing 
	files irrespective of the value of the <tt>clobber</tt> parameter.<p></li>

9</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;KNOWN BUGS</h2>

<p>
Unfortunately, the following bugs are known to exist in the 
current version of the task:

<ul>
<li>    Due to the current lack of a unit-string parser, the  units  of  the        
    output  file  will  always  be  either <tt>'count'</tt> or 
	<tt>'count/s'</tt>. This is        
    true   even   in   cases   such    as 
	<tt>"expr='file1/file2'"</tt>,    or        
    <tt>"expr='file1*file2'"</tt>.  
	This  can  lead to confusion, and a parser is        
    being worked in.<p></li>
</ul>
