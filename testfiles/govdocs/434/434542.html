            <blockquote> 
              <p><strong><font color="#333366" size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">As 
                Union forces got uncomfortably close to Little Rock in 1862, the 
                Confederate government built earthwork forts along the Arkansas 
                River to block Federal access to the capital and to provide a 
                base from which Confederate gunboats could attack Federal shipping 
                on the Mississippi River. Fort Hindman and supporting earthworks 
                were constructed at Arkansas Post, 50 miles up the Arkansas River 
                from its confluence with the Mississippi, during the fall of 1862. 
                The fort, a square bastioned work 190 feet square, was set on 
                high ground at the head of a horseshoe bend. Its dozen guns included 
                three 9-inch Columbiads, one to each riverward casemate, and a 
                hard-hitting 8-inch rifle. Some 5,000 soldiers were housed at 
                the fort and in nearby huts -- Col. John Dunnington, the fort's 
                commander, was a former U. S. naval officer, while the field force 
                was under the command of Brig. Gen. Thomas J. Churchill. A significant 
                portion of the defending Confederate infantry, supported by six 
                light pieces of field artillery, occupied a line of rifle pits 
                1 <font size="2">1/2</font> miles that extended from the fort 
                to Post Bayou. </font></strong></p>
              <p><strong><font color="#333366" size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Because 
                the fort remained a threat to Union supply lines, Union Maj. Gen. 
                John A. McClernand and Rear Adm. David D. Porter led a powerful 
                army-navy expedition from Milliken's Bend against Arkansas Post 
                as a prelude to the Federal operations against Vicksburg. The 
                expedition included three ironclad gunboats, several timber-clad 
                gunboats, and 60 transports carrying 33,000 men -- constituting 
                the Army of the Mississippi that McClernand had divided into two 
                corps of two divisions each under Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman 
                and Brig. Gen. George W. Morgan. Late on the afternoon of January 
                9, 1863, the Union troops landed 3 miles down river from the fort. 
                As the Federals approached the fort overland, the Confereates 
                in the outer earthworks were quickly driven out when the gunboats 
                forged ahead and took them under fire from the flank. Thus, the 
                Confederates retreated to the protection of the fort and adjacent 
                rifle pits.</font></strong></p>
              <p><strong><font color="#333366" size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Late 
                on the afternoon of January 10, when the Union debarkation had 
                been completed and the four divisions were maneuvering for positions 
                from which to launch an assault, the ironclads took the lead. 
                The <em>Louisville</em>, <em>De Kalb</em>, and <em>Cincinnati</em> 
                advanced in line abreast to within 400 yards of the fort, pressing 
                the attack bows on, one to each casemate, while the thinner-skinned 
                vessels followed close behind to throw in shrapnel and light rifled 
                shell. When Porter broke off the engagement because of darkness, 
                the fort was silent, apparently overwhelmed. But when Sherman, 
                reconnoitering by moonlight, drew close to the enemy outposts 
                he could hear the Confederates at work with spades and axes, drawing 
                a new line under cover of their heavy guns and preparing to continue 
                to resist despite the long numerical odds. </font></strong></p>
              <p><strong><font color="#333366" size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Union 
                artillery fired on the fort from artillery positions across the 
                river on the 11th, and the infantry moved into position for an 
                attack. About 1:30 p.m. Porter ordered the ironclads forward to 
                renew the previous day's attack. Then the troops under Sherman 
                and Morgan went forward against the newly drawn Confederate line 
                that extended across the rear of the fort from the river to an 
                impassable swamp 1 mile west. As they approached the fort the 
                Federals saw above its parapet the pennants of the ironclds, which 
                had smothered the heavy guns and were giving the fort a close-up 
                pounding while at the same time passing it to cut off any retreat. 
                As the Federal troops gained a foothold on the Confederate fortifications, 
                despite suffering heavy casualties, white flags began to break 
                out along the Confederate line, several units allowed the Federals 
                inside their works, and Churchill was forced to surrender.</font></strong></p>
              <p><strong><font color="#333366" size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
                battle eliminated a significant impediment to Union shipping on 
                the Mississippi, strengthened the Federal supply line, and contributed 
                to the eventual capture of Vicksburg. The estimated number of 
                Union battlefield casualties was nearly 1,100, while that for 
                the Confederates was nearly 140. However, nearly 5,000 Confederate 
                soldiers were taken captive, including a regiment that marched 
                in from Pine Bluff during the surrender negotiations.</font></strong></p>

              <p><font color="#333366"><strong>In 1993, the Civil War Sites Advisory 
                Commission designated the Battle of Arkansas Post as one of the 
                Civil War's 384 principal battlefields. The Battle of Arkansas 
                Post is nationally significant, because the Union victory on January 
                11, 1863, eliminated a significant impediment to Federal shipping 
                on the Mississippi River, strengthened the Northern supply line, 
                and contributed to the eventual Confederate surrender of Little 
                Rock and Vicksburg. Thus, Arkansas Post was not only a major battle 
                that had an observable influence on the outcome of the Vicksburg 
                campaign, but it was also a significant battle that had an observable 
                impact on the direction and final outcome of the Civil War. </strong></font></p>
