                      <td colspan="2" class="text"><p>In recent years, more and 
                          more leaders of private and public organizations alike 
                          have realized that knowledge is the chief asset of organizations 
                          and the key to maintaining a sustainable and competitive 
                          advantage. Organizational learning means the continuous 
                          acquisition and testing of experience and the transformation 
                          of that experience into knowledge that is made accessible 
                          to everyone within the organization.</p>
                        <p>However, creating a &ldquo;learning organization&rdquo; 
                          is only half the solution. In addition to the familiar 
                          &ldquo;learning curve,&rdquo; companies should establish 
                          a &ldquo;forgetting curve,&rdquo; which is the rate 
                          at which a company can unlearn those habits that hinder 
                          future success. Pursuing unlearning, however, is not 
                          easy. First, very often people are simply unaware of 
                          the need to unlearn (e.g., they are unaware that the 
                          old assumptions regarding the world have changed), and, 
                          second, it is always difficult to undergo a change.</p>
                        <p>The following examples, taken from <span class="brandname">Shared 
                          Voyage</span>, show just how difficult it can be. <span class="brandname">Shared 
                          Voyage: Learning and Unlearning from Remarkable Projects</span> 
                          focuses on four projects: the Advanced Composition Explorer 
                          (NASA), the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (U.S. 
                          Air Force), the Pathfinder Solar-Powered Airplane (NASA), 
                          and the Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (U.S. 
                          Air Force). Each project is presented as a case study 
                          comprises stories collected from key members of the 
                          project teams. The book which was co-authored by A. 
                          Laufer, T. Post and E. Hoffman, was recently published 
                          by the NASA History Office. One of the main objectives 
                          of the book is to encourage unlearning of outdated concepts.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes it takes another person to help you change 
                          your mind-set. During the integration and test phase 
                          of the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) project, 
                          the Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) fell behind. NASA 
                          Project Manager Don Margolies thought that the way to 
                          deal with it was to order their team to work either 
                          weekends or double shifts. But Mary Chiu, APL Project 
                          Manager, was steadfastly opposed to telling her people 
                          to work overtime. Her people were salaried, and she 
                          wasn&rsquo;t going to order them to put in more hours.</p>
                        <p>They argued about it for a while, finally asking the 
                          Chief Engineer at APL to join them for a meeting of 
                          minds. Don hoped that meeting would not turn into a 
                          very divisive discussion. What happened instead was 
                          that Mary pointed out something to Don that he realized 
                          should have been a no-brainer. In fact, it was then 
                          so obvious to him that he was embarrassed that he hadn&rsquo;t 
                          realized it himself. &ldquo;All we have to do is make 
                          it known that we are behind schedule,&rdquo; Mary said. 
                          &ldquo;Professionals don&rsquo;t have to be reminded 
                          that they have a job to do&hellip; they will rise to 
                          the challenge on their own.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>Realizing she was right, Don went back and told NASA 
                          management what Mary had said. She couldn&rsquo;t put 
                          the extra hours on the schedule, but she&rsquo;d assured 
                          him that the work would get done. Ultimately, they recovered 
                          the lost time. Don knew that Mary had taught him a lesson 
                          in basic psychology: it&rsquo;s always better to let 
                          people come up with a good idea and implement it, than 
                          for you to force it down their throat.</p>
                        <p>At times, the role of leaders is to help their team 
                          change their mind-set. During source selections for 
                          the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) project, 
                          Air Force Program Director Terry Little told the team 
                          that he wanted this phase to be completed in six months. 
                          Truth be told, he would&rsquo;ve been happy with seven, 
                          or even eight&mdash;but he wanted to set almost unrealistic 
                          goals. Why? &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want a schedule that 
                          the team felt they could achieve just by working weekends 
                          or figuring out a handful of inventive ways to do things,&rdquo; 
                          he said. &ldquo;I wanted something so outrageous that 
                          it would cause them to at first, give up&mdash;and then, 
                          to step back and examine their assumptions, their beliefs, 
                          everything they&rsquo;d learned from past experiences 
                          and ask themselves with a clean slate: what do I really 
                          need to do to achieve this goal?&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>And that&rsquo;s exactly what they did. The team actually 
                          completed the source selection in <em>five</em> months. 
                          &ldquo;When we talked about it afterwards,&rdquo; Terry 
                          said, &ldquo;the team discovered that they hadn&rsquo;t 
                          known how capable they could be if they just quit thinking 
                          about things in the way they had always thought of them.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>Of course, sometimes teams are not ready to think of 
                          things in new ways. The Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air 
                          Missile program had been around for 20 years, and Program 
                          Director Judy Stokley knew it was time for a major reform.</p>
                        <p>It wasn&rsquo;t easy because of the type of partnership 
                          her team had with the contractor. If the contractor 
                          needed to change something, he had to submit an Engineering 
                          Change Proposal, and the government had to approve it. 
                          The contractor documented every change in parts, down 
                          to the lowest-level nut, bolt, or screw, and sent change 
                          proposals all day long. The government paid him to make 
                          those changes, or they didn&rsquo;t get done. Judy used 
                          to say, &ldquo;If I want my contractor to flush the 
                          toilet in Tucson, I have to write him a contract letter 
                          and pay him to do it.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>She wanted very much to change that mindset, and get 
                          the contractors to have a &ldquo;heart and soul&rdquo; 
                          relationship with their products. If they could write 
                          a good, simple set of performance specifications that 
                          the contractor would control, and the government would 
                          pay a fair price for the product, Judy believed it could 
                          be< a win-win situation for both sides.</p>
                        <p>But she also didn&rsquo;t want any claims against her. 
                          The program had been under litigation for one thing 
                          or another since it started. When Judy took over as 
                          the Program Director, there were twelve standing requests 
                          for equitable adjustment filed by the contractors. She 
                          told the contractors straight out that she couldn&rsquo;t 
                          team with people who filed claims against her. She told 
                          them, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to help you pay for everything, 
                          I&rsquo;m going to help you make a decent profit, and 
                          you are going to make sure that we have a good product 
                          out there.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>At a meeting, she laid out all her plans for reform 
                          to the contractor, and at first she was met with a lot 
                          of nodding heads. Then, the contractor&rsquo;s Chief 
                          Engineer stood up and addressed his Vice President, 
                          &ldquo;Boss, I&rsquo;ve got to make sure that before 
                          you agree to this, you understand what she&rsquo;s saying. 
                          Because if you do, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s 
                          any way you&rsquo;ll agree to it.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>That&rsquo;s when the room became extremely tense. 
                          &ldquo;Right now,&rdquo; the same contractor continued, 
                          &ldquo;if we change something, the government pays. 
                          She&rsquo;s telling you that from now on if we change 
                          something, we pay.&rdquo; From that moment on, it was 
                          clear that the contractors would not embrace any type 
                          of change. Judy felt the urge to laugh out loud; the 
                          attitude of those in the room was indicative of the 
                          same problems plaguing the industry.</p>
                        <p>Then, as a result of a merger with another company, 
                          the Vice President was replaced. The new leader was 
                          able to see the opportunities of Judy&rsquo;s reform 
                          plans, and together they transformed the mind-set and 
                          behavior of their teams.</p>
                        <p>Even though it may be difficult to convince others 
                          to &ldquo;unlearn&rdquo; old habits, the hardest thing 
                          can be to &ldquo;unlearn&rdquo; your own. In this issue 
                          of ASK, John DelFrate&rsquo;s article mentioned former 
                          AeroVironment Project Manager Ray Morgan and his struggle 
                          to overcome his tendency to micromanage. After managing 
                          a solar-powered flight project on which the young test 
                          pilot was nearly killed, Ray says he became &ldquo;exactly 
                          the kind of boss that I said I would never be.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>Staying on at AeroVironment, he was working what should 
                          have been &ldquo;the ultimate job.&rdquo; And yet some 
                          days he felt so much stress on the drive to work that 
                          he almost threw up. He tried to control every aspect 
                          of his projects, working up to 100 hours a week himself, 
                          and killing the morale of everyone he worked with. He 
                          had to control everything; nothing happened without 
                          his approval. People who had been so grateful to come 
                          to work for him were burned out in two or three years. 
                          He knew he&rsquo;d have to either quit or find a solution.</p>
                        <p>Around this time, Ray&rsquo;s wife saw a PBS special 
                          on Edward Deming, who had a revolutionary approach to 
                          management. He talked about incorporating &ldquo;The 
                          Golden Rule&rdquo; and the Scientific Method into your 
                          style. It was the first philosophy that really spoke 
                          to Ray, so he decided to take a night class at UCLA 
                          on the same topic.</p>
                        <p>He saw his professor&rsquo;s teaching style that utilized 
                          the brains of the classroom, and he began to reflect 
                          on how he could do this within his own projects. He 
                          began the difficult task of &ldquo;letting go&rdquo; 
                          and admits that at first it was terrifying. But by the 
                          time he joined the ERAST team to develop Pathfinder, 
                          he says, &ldquo;I was not only a different man, but 
                          a better manager. I had finally begun to be a leader, 
                          and was leading my division in a transformation that 
                          enabled me to draw full value from all of the brains 
                          of my workforce.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>Whether the concepts conveyed through these examples 
                          call for learning (that is, adding on new concepts), 
                          or for unlearning (that is, letting go of some old concepts), 
                          depends to a great extent on the set of beliefs that 
                          the particular project participant (or reader) has developed 
                          throughout his/her experience. One thing, however, is 
                          clear. Today, in our competitive and dynamic environment, 
                          everyone is expected to unlearn, and quite often. New 
                          ideas are breaking traditional molds and updating old 
                          axioms: &ldquo;Live and <em>unlearn</em>.&rdquo; &ldquo;Gone 
                          <em>and</em> forgotten.&rdquo;</p>
