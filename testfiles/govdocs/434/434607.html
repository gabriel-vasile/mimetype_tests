This session is designed to raise participants' awareness of cultural diversity and the importance of valuing
cultural differences.  It highlights the importance of understanding 
how cultural competence is necessary for building a successful
community prevention partnership.  And it stresses that developing
cultural competence is a lifelong process.  This session is a
catalyst that will enable participants to begin the process of
learning how to include and work with people who have different
cultural backgrounds.<BR>

The trainers should practice reading the quotations before the morning session.  Trainers should be
aware of particular cultural groupings that are important to include
as a part of the culture walk.  Trainers should also review the
philosophy and themes for building community prevention partnerships
as outlined in Day 2 of the workshop.<BR>

 <LI> Use T-22 to make the following points:
<BR>

<BR>
<UL>
    <LI> Since we all grow up with a perspective based on our culture of origin, everyone has difficulty working with people from another cultural background.  <BR>

<BR>
    <LI> All cultural groups need to learn to work with different culture groups.  It is a challenge that we all face together.<BR>

<BR>
    <LI> Our cultural heritage may provide us with filters, called prejudices, that give us a set of preconceived ideas about other groups. <BR>

<BR>
    <LI> Members of dominant groups in society may have certain privileges of which they may be unaware.  Their failure to perceive these privileges may act as a barrier to cross-cultural understanding.<BR>

<BR>
    <LI> People who share one grouping (e.g., race) may differ because of a predominant or primary identification with another grouping (e.g., ethnicity).</UL><BR>
<B>T-23: Identify ... Not Resolve</B><BR><BR>
<LI> Also, emphasize the following points:
<BR>
<BR>
<UL>
    <LI> We learn about cultures (ours and others) early in life.<BR>

<BR>
    <LI> <U>Awareness</U> of culture, racial, and other differences that we experienced as children may have been painful to us.<BR>

<BR>
     <LI>Many of the messages we received as children about other cultures are based on misinformation and stereotypes.<BR>

<BR>
     <LI>Many of those childhood messages continue to affect our thoughts and feelings as adults, and they become &quot;tapes&quot; from which come our &quot;knee jerk&quot; reactions to differences.<BR>

<BR>
   <LI>  Through sustained effort, it is possible to get off automatic,  to become <U>aware</U> of our reactions to differences, and to make choices about how we wish to respond- to erase and then record a new tape.</UL></ol>
<A HREF=#top><IMG SRC="../gifs/topbar.GIF" BORDER=0></A>
<BR>
<A NAME="V"><H2>V. The Cultural Awareness Model (15 minutes)</H2></A>
<B>T-24: The Cultural Awareness Model</B><BR><BR>
<H3>A. Present and discuss the following points:</H3>
<OL>
   <LI>   The cultural awareness model is based on work by Peter Muniz and Robert Chasnoff.  It is intended to outline a process by which people can become more aware of how to work with people from different cultures. <BR>

<BR>
   <LI> The model is intended to be fluid; an individual will necessarily go through the stages in the same order as others or in the same way each time.  However, each level must be explored anew with regard to each different culture one seeks to understand.<BR>

<BR>
   <LI> The levels are:<BR><BR>
<B>T-25: Levels of Cultural Awareness (Levels 1-3)</B><BR><BR>
<UL>
<LI><U>Level 1-The Self</U>.  The first level requires that one understand one's own experiences, values, and interpersonal abilities.  
<BR><BR>
     <LI><U>Level 2-Prevention Skills</U>.  This level requires that the individual have the necessary skills to work within the technical areas he or she wants to use for building a relationship with another cultural group or an awareness of the technical areas he or she wants to learn about from another cultural group. It is important to be honest about one's level of competence.<BR>

<BR>
     <LI><U>Level 3-Factors Beyond Culture That May Influence Behavior</U>.  Although everything is affected by cultural interpretations, other factors such as skill levels, hunger, homelessness, health, and safety will have an impact on one's ability to work with another cultural group.
<BR><BR>
  
<B>T-26: Levels of Cultural Awareness (Levels 4-6)</B><BR><BR>
<LI><U>Level 4-One's Own Culture</U>.  We often take our own culture for granted.  We need to explore our culture and understand how it affects our motivations, behaviors, and thoughts before we can know how to interact with other cultures.  In the United States, past generations may have buried aspects of their culture of origin to blend in with the dominant culture, and burying one's culture may have an emotional impact on one's ability to learn about other cultures.
<BR><BR>
     <LI><U>Level 5-Factors Specific to One's Own Community (or Country)</U>.  It is important to understand how our own community history affects how we view other communities.  Both positive and negative experiences are a part of every community heritage.  As one begins to work with other communities, one must understand that communities may differ, even among people with common cultural heritages.  Local issues, especially events receiving high publicity (such as a recent teenage death related to driving under the influence of alcohol or other drugs) and politically powerful groups (such as alcohol producers and distributors who employ a large percentage of community members), shape community perceptions.<BR>
<BR>
    <LI> <U>Level 6-The Other Culture</U>.  We must be able to step outside our biases and accept that other cultures have different ways of perceiving the world that are equal to our own.  We must be open to trying new behaviors and learning new ways of communicating.  We must learn to be able to see things from a different perspective in a way that does not threaten our own identity or culture of origin.  Being open to another culture means accepting the disorientation and awkwardness of learning new ways of perceiving and behaving and at the same time strengthening our understanding of our own culture.  Finally, working with other cultures allows us the flexibility to choose new ways of living if they are congruent with who we want to become in the future.</ul></ol><BR>

<ul>
     <li>The purpose of this activity is to help create awareness about our feelings, our own cultural identity, and our relationships with people from other cultures.<BR>

<BR>
     <li>This is a nonverbal exercise.  It will enhance the experience if you do not talk during the activity.  Focus your own reactions to the experience.<BR>

<BR><BR>
<li> The philosophy for building a community prevention partnership as presented in Part 1 of Principles of Prevention Partnerships:<BR><BR>
<ul>
    <li> Prevention is a moral and an ethical imperative.<BR>

<BR>
     <li>In order to be successful, prevention efforts must address the individual, the drug, and the environment through a systems approach.
<BR>
 
<BR>
     <li>The effort must reach all of the community.  All segments of the community need to be involved in some way.<BR>

<BR>
    <li> The community is the best vehicle through which to develop and implement prevention programs and activities.<BR>

<BR>
    <li> Prevention programs and activities must be ethnically and culturally appropriate.</ul><BR>

<BR>
  <li>  The themes for building a community prevention partnership as presented in Part 1 of Principles of Prevention Partnerships:<BR>

<BR>
<ul>
    <li> <U>Paradigm shift</U>.  We need to rethink how we view prevention and the community's role in prevention.<BR>

<BR>
    <li> <U>Community empowerment</U>.  We need to return power to communities to take responsibility for themselves and to make decisions about their collective future.<BR>

<BR>
    <li> <U>Cultural competency</U>.  We need to learn how to appreciate both the cultures into which we were born and those which are new to us, and to work together in our communities.</ul></ol>

<TR>
	<TD><B>Trainer Note:</B>  The following exercise is an option for Section XI:  Building a Culturally Competent Prevention System Back Home.  This option presents an opportunity for participants to reflect on and synthesize all the information from what has the potential for being an emotionally charged day. </TD>
</TR>
</TABLE><BR><BR>
  Each participant is given a blank envelope and a piece of paper.  Ask participants to address the envelope to themselves and to write &quot;Do not open until (3 months after the training)&quot; on the front.<BR>

<BR>
  Ask the participants to write a letter to themselves explaining what they hope to accomplish in the next 3 months based on their learning at this workshop.<BR>

<BR>
  Once the letter is written, ask participants to list 5 specific action steps that would help them to accomplish the goals they have set for themselves in their letters.<BR>

<BR>
  Give the participants 10 minutes to share their action steps with each other in groups of 4.<BR>

<BR>
  Have participants ceremoniously place their letters in the envelopes and seal them until 3 months after the training, when hopefully they will pull them out, open them, and assess whether they achieved what they had hoped.<BR>
