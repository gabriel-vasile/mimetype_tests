<H1>Introduction to the Trainer's Manual</H1>
<a name="top"> </a>
<H2>How To Use This Manual</H2>

The articles in this <I>Trainer Resource Manual</I> pertain to the four major themes of the OSAP Community Partnership Training (OCPT) Institute: prevention, community development and mobilization, planning and evaluation, and cultural diversity.  They are arranged alphabetically, by author name, under each of these four major headings.  Most articles are preceded by an abstract written especially for the OCPT audience.<BR><BR>

Additional resource articles may be found in the <I>Trainer and Participant Workshop Manuals</I>, where they are arranged by workshop topic.  All partnership teams attending the Institute will receive a copy of the <I>Trainer Resource Manual and Participant Workshop Manual</I>.<BR><BR>

Some articles in the <I>Trainer Resource Manual</I> may also be useful for trainers leading the workshops.  Workshop trainers may want to scan the table of contents for pertinent articles.  For example, the article <I>Evaluation: A Symposium</I>, which appears under Planning and Evaluation in this manual, could be a useful resource for training workshop 4B(6), Tools for Community Assessment.  Likewise, some of the topical articles in the <I>Trainer Workshop Manual</I> deal with major Institute themes, and thus may be useful for trainers preparing to present material for sessions other than the workshops.  The two resource books are, in other words, complementary. To save space, each article listed, no matter how broad its applicability, appears in only one place.<BR><BR>

The "Predelivery Preparation" sections of the Institute <I>Trainer Manual</I> list additional relevant resources that are not included in either resource manual.<BR><BR>

OCPT staff welcomes your comments and suggestions on how to improve the usefulness of these training resources.<BR><BR>
