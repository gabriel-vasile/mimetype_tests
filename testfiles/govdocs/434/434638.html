	        <p>CDC and [Your organization] "Celebrate the Cure" <br />
      During Ulcer Awareness Week </p>
	        <p>[City, State] - If you're one of the millions of Americans who suffer from peptic ulcer disease, [Your organization] and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) may have some news that could be cause for celebration this August.&nbsp; Across the nation, health officials and other organizations will be observing Ulcer Awareness Week, October 6-13, 2003, by spreading the message that most ulcers are caused by a bacterial infection and can be cured with antibiotics. <br />
      </p>
	        <p>According to CDC, 75 percent of Americans are still unaware that an infectious bacterium, <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> (<i>H. pylori</i>), is the cause of most ulcers.&nbsp; More importantly to the estimated 25 million Americans who will suffer from an ulcer at some point during their lifetime, this bacterium - and the nine out of 10 ulcers that it causes - can be effectively cured with antibiotic therapy.&nbsp; These little known facts form the momentum for Ulcer Awareness Week. <br />
&nbsp;Contributing to the unnecessary morbidity and estimated $6 billion in annual health care costs associated with the disease, CDC also reports that many ulcer sufferers self-medicate and are not in contact with doctors about their symptoms.&nbsp; In a 1999 survey over a quarter of those surveyed were self-medicating, and more than half of those patients said that they had never consulted a doctor about their symptoms. <br />
</p>
	        <p>"We need to break the costly cycle of pain, relief and relapse in which too many ulcer sufferers find themselves.&nbsp; Our local campaign will communicate that there is now hope for a permanent end to their pain and that they should contact a health professional about their symptoms," says [Your spokesperson's name] with [Organization]. <br />
      </p>
	        <p>Dr. Mitchell Cohen, director of CDC's Division of Bacterial and Mycotic Diseases adds, "The new treatment is a dramatic medical advance because eliminating <i>H. pylori</i> with antibiotics means that there is a greater than 90 percent chance that the ulcer will be gone for good.&nbsp; Without antibiotic therapy, more than half of ulcer patients experience a relapse within one year." <br />
&nbsp;For years, ulcers were considered a chronic condition caused by stress and spicy foods that had to be endured for a lifetime.&nbsp; In 1994 the National Institutes of Health concluded that most ulcers are caused by <i>H. pylori</i> infection and should be treated as an infectious disease in symptomatic patients.&nbsp; Evidence shows that even patients who have had an ulcer for years could be effectively treated and permanently cured with antibiotics. <br />
&nbsp;</p>
	        <p>The situation is complicated by the enduring, traditional belief that stress and spicy foods are the culprits.&nbsp; CDC research shows that 57 percent of the population still thinks that stress is the main cause of ulcers, while nine percent attribute the cause to spicy foods.&nbsp; This perception is reinforced by the fact that ulcer symptoms may be affected by stress or diet; however, while these may worsen symptoms, they are not the cause. <br />
&nbsp;</p>
	        <p>Today, there are new diagnostic tools and treatments which make <i>H. pylori</i> detection and cure more accessible for ulcer patients.&nbsp; CDC formed a national <i>H. pylori</i> Partnership and began a nationwide public and professional educational campaign, of which Ulcer Awareness Week is a major part, to promote increased ulcer awareness. </p>

	        <p> Media Advisory: Local Chefs Cook Off to Celebrate the Cure for Ulcers </p>
	        <p>What: A Celebrity "Cook Off" will be held in conjunction with National Ulcer Awareness Week, October 6-13, 2003.&nbsp; Former ulcer patients will be tasting and judging dishes prepared by local chefs from [name restaurants].</p>
	        <p> The event is being held to "Celebrate the Cure" for ulcer disease, which we now know is caused by an infection, and not by stress or spicy food.&nbsp; For most ulcer sufferers, a two-week course of antibiotic therapy means their ulcer, and the pain it brings, will be gone for good. </p>
	        <p>Who: The event is being sponsored by [Your organization], with support from [name of contributing local partners]. </p>

	        <p>Where: [Location - address with directions if needed] </p>
	        <p>Why: Over 25 million Americans will develop a peptic ulcer during their lifetime.&nbsp; The fact that most ulcers are caused by a bacterial infection, and not by stress or spicy foods, is great news for them because it means that their ulcer can be cured for good.&nbsp; Yet 75 percent of people are unaware of the bacterial cause, and thousands of ulcer patients continue to suffer unnecessarily.&nbsp; Ulcer Awareness Week is a new national health observance to promote increased awareness and encourage patients to see a health professional about a cure for their ulcer. </p>

      [Address]</p>
	        <p> Dear [Name]: Given the option of putting up with the pain of an illness for many years, or curing it for good with a two week treatment, what would you do?&nbsp; Unfortunately, if you are an ulcer sufferer, the first option is more common - because the majority of patients don't know that most ulcers are caused by an infection and can be cured with antibiotics. </p>
	        <p>To bridge this awareness gap, I am writing for your help in publicizing information and activities that could be cause for celebration for thousands of ulcer sufferers in [Your state/region/town name].&nbsp; [Your organization] has launched a campaign during Ulcer Awareness Week October 6-13, 2003, a new national health observance initiated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), to make sure the community and ulcer patients hear the good news about a new cure for ulcer disease. </p>
	        <p>These statistics from CDC illustrate the need for such a campaign, and the potential benefit to individuals and society of changing the way that ulcers are treated: </p>
	        <p>Over 25 million Americans (approximately one in ten adults) will develop peptic ulcer disease at some point during their lives, the burden of which is an estimated $6 billion in health care costs annually in the U.S. </p>
	        <p>Nine of 10 peptic ulcers are caused by a bacterial infection <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> (<i>H. pylori</i>).&nbsp; In those cases, antibiotic therapy is over 90 percent effective in getting rid of the ulcer for good.&nbsp; Without antibiotic therapy, over half of patients experience a relapse within one year. </p>
	        <p>The cost of 2-week antibiotic therapy is less than one tenth the cost of symptom management medication, which generally covers 187 days over 15 years. </p>
	        <p>Yet despite these well-documented facts, about 75 percent of Americans are still unaware that ulcers are caused by a bacterial infection.&nbsp; Most continue to believe that stress and spicy foods are the culprits. </p>
	        <p><i>H. pylori</i> and ulcer disease present a fascinating study of how medical science has provided us with the unique challenge of 'unlearning' how we think about certain conditions and illnesses.&nbsp; Once widely considered a chronic condition that had to be managed over a lifetime, we now know that peptic ulcers are an infectious disease causally related to a bacterium that manages to thrive in the hostile digestive environment but can be cured with antibiotics.&nbsp; While there is still much to learn about <i>H. pylori</i>, there is a lot of information that could be relevant to your readers/viewers, for example: </p>
	        <p>Because most people assume they can not cure their ulcer, many self-medicate with over-the-counter acid reducing medications to manage symptoms and never see a doctor about their symptoms, making it even harder to get the news about the real cause and the new cure for ulcers to them. </p>
	        <p>Misperceptions surround not only the cause of ulcers, but also who is most at risk.&nbsp; The traditional stereotype of a high-stressed male executive no longer holds true.&nbsp; Women, lower income workers, and minorities are just as likely to be affected. </p>
	        <p>Prevalence and severity of ulcer disease generally increases with age.&nbsp; While older people are most likely to have ulcers, the first onset of symptoms for many may begin around age 35.&nbsp; The good news for long-term sufferers is that even if they have had their ulcer for years it can still be cured with antibiotics if it is caused by <i>H. pylori</i>. </p>
	        <p>In addition to these facts, [Your organization] has arranged a number of activities to mark the coming Ulcer Awareness Week that you might find of interest, including: </p>
	        <p>Ulcer Awareness Health Fair - [Date, hours] at [where, address].&nbsp; Health professionals will answer questions and give out free materials. </p>
	        <p>Stomach Pain Seminar - Expert [name, title and affiliation] will give a free seminar on stomach pain for public and patients at [where] on [date] at [time].</p>
	        <p>Free <i>H. pylori</i> Screening for Ulcer Patients - [Institution name] will be giving free screenings for <i>H. pylori</i> to all patients who have ulcers or have a history of ulcer disease on [dates] at [times].</p>
	        <p>"Celebrate the Cure" Cook Off - Just because you have an ulcer doesn't mean that you can't enjoy good food ever again.&nbsp; Join some of the best chefs in [town] to watch them cook off for former ulcer patients.</p>
	        <p>We have a number of experts lined up including [list of names] who could give interviews.&nbsp; I will follow up by telephone soon to see if you are interested in additional information on any of the above story suggestions.&nbsp; In the meantime, please feel free to contact me at [telephone number] if I can be of assistance.      </p>

      <p>Celebrating the Cure for Ulcer Disease </p>
      <center>
        </center>
      <p>By [Name, Professional Position] </p>
      <p>If an illness once thought to be a long-term chronic condition was determined to be a curable infectious disease, you'd think it would be cause for major celebration.&nbsp; This is precisely the case with peptic ulcers, yet the good news about a cure has yet to be fully embraced.</p>
      <p> This year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the <i>H. pylori</i> Partnership have proclaimed October 7-14 as Ulcer Awareness Week, in an effort to more widely spread the news that most ulcers are caused by a bacterial infection which can be cured with antibiotics. </p>
      <p>Peptic ulcer disease is a significant health care problem that affects millions of people and causes a tremendous burden on the health care system.&nbsp; Up to 25 million people will develop an ulcer during their lifetime.&nbsp; In addition to their personal pain and suffering, the disease is estimated to account for $6 billion in health care related costs each year. </p>
      <p>The discovery of the ulcer causing bacterium, <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> (<i>H. pylori</i>), was made in 1983.&nbsp; Scientific consensus followed in 1994 when an expert panel agreed that nine out of 10 ulcers are caused by <i>H. pylori</i>, and that ulcer patients who have the infection should undergo antibiotic treatment. </p>
      <p>Since that time, there have been a number of advances in the diagnosis and treatment of <i>H. pylori</i> infection, resulting in less invasive methods of testing and cure rates as high as 90 percent.&nbsp; In comparison, when ulcer disease is treated with acid suppressing medications alone, there is a greater than 50 percent chance that the ulcer will recur within one year. </p>
      <p>According to CDC, despite the dramatic drop in recurrence rates, primary care physicians still reported treating their first time ulcer patients with acid-reducing medications and not antibiotic-based regimens.&nbsp; At a time when studies demonstrate that physicians are frequently prescribing antibiotics unnecessarily, it is ironic that they are being underused for peptic ulcer disease. </p>
      <p>CDC research also shows that the public remains largely unaware of the link between the bacteria and ulcer disease.&nbsp; Recently, only one quarter of adults in a national survey correctly identified a bacterial infection as the cause of most ulcers.&nbsp; As a testament to the power of traditional beliefs, most continue to think that stress and diet are the cause.&nbsp; These beliefs appear to be reinforced by the fact that stress and diet may make ulcer symptoms worse - however, they are not the cause.</p>
      <p> It becomes clear that if we are to change the way ulcer disease is treated, we must first change the way that it is perceived - from a chronic condition to a curable infectious disease.&nbsp; CDC and [your organization] hope this Ulcer Awareness Week will give ulcer sufferers a reason to celebrate.&nbsp; If you have a history of ulcer disease or think you may have an ulcer, take this time to contact a health professional and ask if an infection could be the real cause of your pain - it may very well be curable! &nbsp; <br />
