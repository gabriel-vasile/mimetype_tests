The stem at the hull bottom (forefoot) extends forward ofthe deck line, creating a bulbous bow form that is covered by silt andnot visible to divers. The lines are reminiscent of the iron-clad rams,the precursor of the modern capital ship. The extension is not forramming, but for additional bow buoyancy and control of the bow wave forefficiency at high speed.</P><P ALIGN="justify">Until reaching the area of heavy damage, which beginsto be visible about 40 feet back from the bow around frame 10, the shipdoes not give the impression of being very large -- the thwartship'sdimensions here are less than half those of midship. Damage is slight inthis area, the weather or forecastle deck is still in place and variousdeck fittings, chain, cable and some fairleads are still present. Thebull nose is undamaged and both holes are clear of marine growth, muchin contrast to the hawse pipes, which are heavily overgrown with marineorganisms. The anchors and cable have been removed. The salvage reportindicates the anchors were blown clear in the explosion that sunk theship (Navy salvage record 16 January 1943).</P><P ALIGN="center"><TABLE BORDER=0 ALIGN="center" WIDTH="500"><TR><TD ALIGN="center"><IMG SRC="fig311.jpg" ALT="diver working on illustrations" BORDER=1><BR><FONT SIZE="-1"> Figure 3.11.

The silt is not very deepand many objects are visible. There are 6-inch chromed pipes layingabout that were apparently used to outline the bow during pre-monumentmemorialization. Steel plates, concrete blocks and a wash basin lieamong many unrecognizable metal pieces.</P><P ALIGN="justify">At about 40 to 55 feet aft and 2 feet above thepresent silt line on the port hull side are rectangular through-hullfittings. Their apparent function, as ascertained from historicalphotos, is some form of out board discharge.</P><P ALIGN="justify">Little damage is evident until one runs directly intothe flared metal edges of the major blast zone, where jagged metal ofthe hull sides is twisted forward and out. Here the midship area is aconfusion of twisted bulkheads and deck elements. The survey teamdiscovered a number of live 50-caliber antiaircraft rounds inside theship under the folds of twisted metal. Toward the port side there arebadly twisted and deformed hatch coamings, which indicate the main decklevel.</P><P ALIGN="justify">The extensive bow damage is the obvious result of amassive explosion that blew outward and upward. Hull plates are splayedout over 20 feet from the ship's sides. The explosion appears to haveoccurred deep within the ship, with the main force directed upward,which is expected because of the dampening effects of the watersurrounding the hull. The forecastle deck and 5-inch thick main deck aregone. The armor belt, which is at the level of the torpedo blister,apparently helped contain the blast and direct it upward. The forwardbow spaces, which are not armored, are relatively undamaged.</P><P ALIGN="justify">At 70 feet aft, the torpedo blister begins andbecomes the dominant feature on the sides; inspection hatches arevisible in the blister top. Much of the hull side from gunnel to torpedoblister has been removed by Navy salvage divers, apparently withtorches. The Navy salvage record reports much diver cutting betweenframes 16-24. Evidently the explosion pushed the hull outward above thearmor belt. The salvage records indicate metal overhanging the port hullin this area (Navy salvage record 7 April 1943). Scalloped edges fromcutting operations are discernible at many points on the wreck. Wherethere are discontinuities in the hull, it is usually easy to tell if thecause was the blast or intentional salvage actions.</P><P ALIGN="justify">Extensive salvage operations are recorded in the bowarea. The remains of the forecastle deck and main deck were cut away andremoved, and mud was pumped out of the area. The salvage log recordsmuch cutting on the second and third decks and the forward bulkheads.The magazine explosion clearly damaged the lower deck areas aft as faras the No. 2 turret. Navy salvage divers were unable to enter sectionsof No. 2 because passageways were blocked with wreckage. The explosionapparently collapsed bulkheads supporting the No. 1 turret, which stillremains onsite, and the turret rests 15 feet lower than its originalposition.</P><P ALIGN="justify">On the port side approximately 80 feet and 112 feetaft of the stem, open cracks visible in the torpedo blister continuebelow the silt line. These cracks in the sides above the silt probablyindicate a major structural failure associated with the magazineexplosion. In all probability the inner hull and armor belt are alsocracked.</P><P ALIGN="justify">Along the sides of turret No. 1 below the rangefinders, teak decking -- the forward remains of the forecastle deck --is visible after light fanning of the silt. A few feet farther aft onthe port side is a hatch that has been propped open for access belowdecks, probably by the salvage teams (Figure 3.12). The tropical awningsupport is in place.</P><P ALIGN="center"><TABLE BORDER=0 ALIGN="center" WIDTH="500"><TR><TD ALIGN="center"><IMG SRC="fig312.jpg" ALT="awing cover" BORDER=1><BR><FONT SIZE="-1">Figure 3.12.

The armor plate top was cut off andthe embrasures opened to remove the gun tubes, breeches, elevators andother machinery. A gun tub for a 5-inch gun aft of No. 2 turret on thestarboard side shows some damage from the explosion or collapse ofsuperstructure, which was subsequently removed in the salvage.</P><P><BR><TABLE BORDER=0 ALIGN="center" WIDTH="100%"><TR><TD ALIGN="left" WIDTH="33%" NOWRAP><FONT SIZE="+1">&lt;&lt;&lt; <A HREF="scrs3d.htm"><B>PREVIOUS</B></A></FONT></TD><TD ALIGN="center" WIDTH="33%" NOWRAP><FONT SIZE="+1"><A HREF="scrst.htm"><B>TABLE OF CONTENTS</B></A></TD><TD ALIGN="right" WIDTH="33%" NOWRAP><FONT SIZE="+1"><A HREF="scrs3f.htm"><B>CONTINUE</B></A> &gt;&gt;&gt;</FONT></P></TR></TABLE></P><P><HR NOSHADE SIZE="2"><font size="-1">http://www.nps.gov/usar/scrs/scrs3e.htm<BR>Last Updated: 27-Apr-2001</font></P></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
