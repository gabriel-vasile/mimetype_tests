                Wreck of the Carrier Pigeon. - Probably a Total Loss</strong><br>
                <br>
                Intelligence was received in this city last evening that the clipper 
                ship <em>Carrier Pigeon</em>, of Boston, had gone ashore on the 
                night of the 6th instant, in a thick fog about thirty miles south 
                of the Heads, where she now lies stern on. The ship has bilged, 
                but it is hoped that the cargo between decks may be saved. The 
                news were received through an ignorant Mexican. We look for further 
                particulars from a reliable source to-day.<br>
                <br>
                Mr. Bacon, the agent of the underwriters at Boston has taken efficient 
                measures to afford assistance immediately, and goes down to the 
                wreck with steamers and men to render all the assistance requisite.<br>

                <strong>The Wreck of the Carrier Pigeon</strong><br><br>
                The U. S. surveying steamer <em>Active</em>, Lieut. Alden, sailed 
                on the 8th inst. from port, and after stopping at the Farallones, 
                proceeded to the wreck of the <em>Carrier Pigeon</em>, which lies 
                about 7 miles north of Point Ano Nuevo, bow on shore. Her bows 
                lay about 500 feet from the beach, and she rests amidships on 
                a ledge of rocks, which have broken the ship's back. The tide 
                ebbs and flows in her, and is up to her between-decks. A portion 
                if not all of her cargo between decks may be saved if the weather 
                hold good, which is doubtful, as there was a heavy surf when the 
                <em>Active</em> left. Her mizzenmast was cut away on the 8th at 
                3 P.M., and they intended to cut away the other masts to save 
                the ship. We learn that if the parties interested had allowed 
                the <em>Active</em> to got to work, without bartering and bantering 
                on salvage, a considerable amount of property might have been 
                saved for the underwriters. Too much praise cannot be awarded 
                to the officers of the <em>Active</em> for their exertions to 
                save the goods from the ship, until parties in charge began to 
                talk about salvage, wages, and so forth. Lieut. Cuyler deserves 
                great credit for boarding the ship, taking the captain ashore, 
                and securing a line on shore so as to allow their boats to go 
                back and forward. The insurance agents in California should have 
                liberal views as regards wrecks on our coasts, more so than in 
                the Atlantic States. Soon after the arrival of the <em>Active</em>, 
                the <em>Sea Bird</em> arrived with Mr. Bacon on board, who took 
                charge of the wreck.</p>

                Steamer Sea Bird Ashore -- The Carrier Pigeon</strong><br>
                <br>
                We have intelligence of the steamer <em>Sea Bird</em> having gone 
                ashore, furnished by Purser Wright of the steamer <em>Goliah</em>, 
                Capt. R. Haley, which arrived yesterday afternoon from the wreck 
                of the <em>Carrier Pigeon.</em> That vessel was lying head on 
                shore, with the water ebbing and flowing in her.<br>
                The steamer <em>Sea Bird</em>, laying at anchor astern of the 
                <em>Carrier Pigeon</em>, at 3 A. M. on Friday, parted her best 
                bower chain; she immediately let go her second anchor which brought 
                her up head to the sea. In a few minutes she parted her second 
                chain, when the captain made sail on her, and veered her clear 
                of a reef of rocks lying off her lee side. There being a heavy 
                ground swell when the second anchor brought the steamer's head 
                to the sea, the chain veered across the forefoot, which caused 
                her to start the scurf at the bottom of the forefoot, and in a 
                few minutes the steamer was reported to be filling. Capt. Wright 
                immediately kept her off under steam, and succeeded in reaching 
                the beach under Point Ano Nuevo, where he beached her, all hands 
                being engaged in pumping and bailing in the meantime. Capt. Waterman 
                and the crew of the <em>Carrier Pigeon</em> were on board at the 
                time. The <em>Goliah</em> took out the cargo that the <em>Sea 
                Bird</em> had received from the <em>Carrier Pigeon</em>, some 
                1,200 packages of merchandise.<br>
                When the <em>Goliah</em> left the Sea Bird, Capt. Wright thought 
                he would be able to get the steamer afloat the next: high water. 
                She was not leaking as bad as when she went ashore. The <em>Goliah</em> 
                left the wreck of the <em>Carrier Pigeon</em> yesterday morning 
                at 9 A. M.<br>
                Immediately after beaching the <em>Sea Bird </em>Captain Wright 
                sent an Express to San Francisco for the steamer <em>Goliah</em> 
                to come to his relief. Capt. Waterman and a gang of men remained 
                at the wreck of the <em>Carrier Pigeon</em>, and if the weather 
                continues good, there will be more goods saved. Capt. Doane, officers 
                and crew of the <em>Carrier Pigeon</em> were passengers in the 
                <em>Goliah</em>. The <em>Goliah</em> returned to the wreck last 
                evening.</p>
