        amputations among patients with diabetes were of the minor type; among 
        patients without diabetes, most were major.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>RECOMMENDATION:</b> 
        Greater use of outpatient facilities and providing increased resources 
        for screening, preventive education, podiatry, and early intervention 
        may offer both limb- and cost-saving opportunities. Free flow and integration 
        of clinical and cost information could provide the physician with a more 
        adequate basis for best use of resources.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>ABSTRACT:</b> 
        Investigators reviewed data on 134 hospital admissions for nontraumatic 
        lower limb amputations from July 1989 to April 1992 at Otago (New Zealand) 
        Health Board hospitals in order to assess potential cost-saving options. 
        Detailed information on costs, clinical activity, and length of hospital 
        stay was available for analysis. Statistical analysis used the Mann-Whitney 
        U test and the chi-square test. Total in-hospital cost was $1.09 million 
        (New Zealand dollars), with an annual cost of $388,000. The mean cost 
        for general surgical admission was $11,342 (median $21,367), which was 
        significantly higher (p &lt; 0.001) than that for orthopedic patients, 
        whose mean cost was $2,318 (median $6,277). General surgical patients, 
        compared with orthopedic patients, required major amputation (above and 
        below the knee) more frequently (46.5 percent versus 10.4 percent) and 
        had concomitant diabetes more frequently (36.0 percent versus 4.2 percent). 
        Of amputations among patients with diabetes, 73.9 percent were minor (forefoot 
        and toe), versus 29.0 percent for nondiabetic patients (p &lt; 0.005). 
        For all admissions, ward costs accounted for 55.6 percent of in-hospital 
        costs per admission, making length of stay the most important determinant 
        of admission cost. The long preoperative stay spent to avoid amputation 
        might be decreased by greater use of outpatient facilities for investigation 
        and initial management. The longest portion of hospital stay is for accommodating 
        major amputees until they are fully mobile using an artificial limb; use 
        of less costly facilities outside acute hospital wards may achieve the 
        same ends more economically. 3 figures, 19 references.</font></p>

        With education on foot care, daily self-inspection of the feet, and effective

        should be preventable.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>ABSTRACT:</b> 
        The authors determined the mean 1-year cost of $20,881 (in 1987 dollars) 
        for treating 20 patients with diabetes during the year of their amputation(s). 
        This figure is close to the figure of $21,439 for a more recent study 
        in Dunedin, New Zealand. The authors point out that using diabetes codes 
        to identify patients with diabetes has been shown to miss 45 percent of 
        these patients. In the present study, many surgical patients with diabetes 
        remained undiagnosed throughout their admissions. The authors found in 
        their own study that 40 percent of patients with diabetes had not had 
        their feet inspected by their diabetes care attendant in the previous 
        12 months and that 57 percent had poor nail or skin care. The authors 
        suggest that a team approach makes early intervention more likely and 
        state that this would involve close liaison between the diabetes nurse, 
        physician, podiatrist, and preferably a surgical team with skills in vascular 
        surgery and a special interest in the diabetic foot. 6 references.</font></p>

        The state of Wisconsin maintains a database of information on all hospitalizations, 
        including costs. For 1994, hospital discharge data revealed 53,791 admissions 
        in Wisconsin for which diabetes was listed as a primary or secondary diagnosis. 
        Total costs were $545 million; costs of individual admissions ranged from 
        $150 to $1.5 million (median, $6,280; mean, $10,120). For 8 percent (4,234) 
        of admissions, diabetes was listed as the principal diagnosis; the cost 
        of these admissions was $42 million. For the remaining 92 percent, diabetes 
        was listed as a secondary diagnosis. Among these events, costs by principal 
        diagnosis were $208 million for circulatory diseases (38 percent of total 
        costs); $42 million for digestive diseases (8 percent); $35 million for 
        respiratory diseases (6 percent); $32 million for musculoskeletal conditions 
        (6 percent); $30 million for complications of medical care (5 percent); 
        $28 million for neoplasms (5 percent); $21 million for injury and poisoning 
        (4 percent); $16 million for genitourinary conditions (3 percent); and 
        $81 million for all other causes (15 percent). By age, costs were $213 
        million for persons under age 65 (39 percent), $176 million for those 
        aged 65-74 (32 percent), and $156 million for persons aged 75 and over 
        (29 percent). Medicare was billed for 68 percent of the costs; other government-supported 
        reimbursement, including Medicaid, brought the total supported by taxpayers 
        to over 75 percent. Private insurance accounted for 23 percent. 1 figure,

        The authors review the incidence, course, prognosis, and treatment of 
        diabetes-related nephropathy. Of patients with type 1 diabetes, 40 to 
        50 percent develop clinically evident renal disease; two-thirds of those 
        who do (30 percent overall) require replacement therapy for end-stage 
        renal disease (ESRD). From 1973 to 1980, the percentage of ESRD attributable 
        to diabetes tripled. ESRD from diabetes is disproportionally common among 
        blacks (versus whites). Microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria develop 
        5 to 10 years and 10 to 15 years, respectively, after initial diagnosis 
        of diabetes. Glomerular filtration rate and serum creatinine generally 
        remain constant during the first 10 to 15 years of insulin dependence. 
        ESRD occurs approximately 5 years after persistent proteinuria and azotemia 
        develop. Among patients with type 1 diabetes-related nephropathy, almost 
        two-thirds die from renal failure, 25 to 30 percent from cardiovascular 
        complications, and 5 to 15 percent from other disorders; patients with 
        type 2 diabetes die more frequently from cardiovascular complications. 
        After 5 years, survival is about 75 percent for patients who receive kidney 
        transplants from living related donors, versus 40 to 50 percent for patients 
        who receive other ESRD therapy. In 1982, average hospital days for patients 
        with diabetes receiving dialysis were 37 percent greater than for ESRD 
        patients without diabetes. In the first post-transplantation year, patients 
        with diabetes averaged 45 percent more days than those without diabetes. 
        Respective annual per capita costs for all patients with ESRD and for 
        patients with diabetic ESRD were $23,833 and $35,616 for hemodialysis, 
        $23,076 and $36,585 for peritoneal dialysis, and $32,075 and $43,010 for

        The cost of health care in the United States is usually attributed to 
        a disease according to the primary diagnosis on the patient's medical 
        record. This method underestimates the cost of hospital care for patients 
        with diabetes, which often contributes to a variety of other diseases 
        or complications. The authors used the 1987 National Hospital Discharge 
        Survey to determine hospitalization rates for patients with diabetes and 
        a matched control group; excess hospitalizations and associated costs 
        were attributed to diabetes. Only those hospitalizations with a diagnosis-related 
        group that matched a late complication were included in the analysis. 
        Average cost per day for complications was obtained from the Pracon Med 
        PROs Audit, a Medicare database. For neuropathy, the highest hospitalization 
        rate among persons with diabetes occurred in the 45- to 54-year age group, 
        6.74 per 1.000; the highest rate for controls (1.80) was in the group 
        75 years of age and over. Patients with diabetes aged 45 or younger were 
        46 times as likely to be hospitalized due to neuropathy as those in the 
        control group (95 percent CI, 45.0 to 47.4). Those with diabetes were 
        21.8 times as likely to be admitted for skin ulcers/gangrene (95 percent 
        CI, 21.6 to 22.0), 15 times as likely for peripheral vascular disease, 
        10 times as likely for congestive heart failure, and almost 10 times as 
        likely for atherosclerosis. The risk of cerebrovascular accident and heart 
        disease was 6 to 10 times greater for diabetic patients than for controls. 
        Hospitalization from renal complications was much more common at younger 
        ages for those with diabetes. Late complications of diabetes resulted 
        in nearly 7 million hospital days; inpatient hospitalization costs were 
        estimated to be $5.091 billion. 1 figure, 5 tables, 16 references.</font></p>

        The authors used 1992 data from the Dutch organization SIG Health Care 
        Information to identify all lower extremity amputations in The Netherlands. 
        Using average costs associated with such amputations obtained from the 
        National Health Tariffs Authority, Netherlands, the authors were able 
        to determine the average cost of hospitalizations. Total direct costs 
        included those associated with hospital stay and the average procedure-specific 
        costs (for surgeon and anesthetist fees and the operating room) for the 
        specific level of amputation. Patient-specific charges were not available. 
        In 1992, there were 1,810 diabetesrelated lower extremity amputations 
        involving 1,575 hospitalizations. The mean hospital stay was 41.8 days, 
        with a mean cost of &#163; 10,531. The total direct cost associated with 
        hospitalization and surgery for diabetesrelated amputations was &#163; 
        16.59 million, and more than 65,000 hospital days were used. Hospital 
        days for amputation among persons without diabetes totaled almost 46,000. 
        Hospital stays in this group were significantly shorter (mean: 31.8 days, 
        p &lt; 0.001) than in persons with diabetes. When outcomes were adjusted 
        for age, more multiple amputations were performed in persons with diabetes 
        (13.6 percent) than in those without diabetes (6.6 percent, p &lt; 0.001). 
        Indirect costs and costs of continued medical care at rehabilitation centers 
        and other medical facilities were not taken into account in this study, 
        and, thus, the actual costs associated with lower extremity amputations 
        in the population with diabetes were even higher than this study reported. 
        Studies have shown that lower extremity amputations are at least partly 
        preventable with multidisciplinary treatment programs. 1 figure, 4 tables,

        Admission records at Port of Spain Hospital in Trinidad were reviewed 
        for all patients with diabetes admitted to any of seven medical wards, 
        five general surgical wards, or two ophthalmology wards over a 26-week 
        period beginning in October 1993. During the study period, 1,722 (13.6 
        percent) of a total of 12,673 admissions involved patients (n = 1,447) 
        with diabetes. One hundred seventy-eight of these patients had more than 
        one admission; 1,269 had a single admission. Admission rates increased 
        with age and were approximately 40 percent higher in the population of 
        Indian descent than in those of African origin. Diabetes prevalence in 
        the population had a primary influence on admission rates, with level 
        of admissions and morbidity also influenced by accessibility to hospital 
        services and quality of care in the community. Conditions frequently present 
        on admission included disorders of blood glucose control, foot diseases, 
        renal impairment, cardiac failure, angina, and myocardial infarction and 
        stroke. The fatality rate among admissions was 8.9 percent (154 deaths), 
        and the mean length of stay was 4 days. The presence of renal impairment 
        on admission was associated with a fatality rate of 21 percent. The annual 
        number of bed days occupied by persons with diabetes was 26,659, which 
        represented 23 percent of all bed days on the study wards. Annual financial 
        cost for all patients admitted with diabetes was TT$10.7 million, including 
        TT$3.1 million for patients admitted with foot problems, TT$2.5 million 
        for those with glucose control problems, and TT$5.1 million for those 
        with other diagnoses. The mean cost of 1 patient admission with diabetes

        Because diabetes consumes many hospital resources in this region, especially 
        for the growing elderly population, alternative options for providing 
        care are needed. Data audits must be performed or restricted to well-defined 
        groups (e.g., diabetes as principal diagnosis only) to achieve an accurate 
        analysis.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>ABSTRACT:</b> 
        Hospital discharge data were collected to describe trends in utilization 
        and costs of admissions for diabetes and associated conditions in an urban 
        teaching hospital in New Zealand from 1985 through 1989. A validation 
        study was performed to assess the impact of underreporting or nonreporting 
        and misclassification of diabetes as a discharge diagnosis. Admissions 
        for diabetes-related conditions represented 5 percent of all hospital 
        inpatient costs in 1989, but 45 percent of admissions where diabetes should 
        have been a subsidiary diagnosis were omitted from the discharge data. 
        During the study period, an average 4.6 percent of total hospital bed 
        utilization was for diabetes admissions, 1.9 percent as the principal, 
        and 2.7 percent as the subsidiary diagnosis. Length of stay averaged 12.3 
        days for admissions with diabetes as the principal diagnosis and 15.4 
        days for diabetes as a subsidiary diagnosis. The highest daily cost was 
        for diabetic eye disease (90 percent of these costs were for operative 
        treatment of cataracts, 10 per-cent for treatment of retinopathy), and 
        the highest total and mean per-patient costs were for peripheral vascular 
        disease. Annual bed utilization where diabetes was a subsidiary diagnosis 
        rose from 1,580 to 5,972 days during the study period, but utilization 
        days where diabetes was the principal diagnosis declined from 2,036 to 
        1,860. Macrovascular disease accounted for most admissions and bed utilization 
        when diabetes was the subsidiary diagnosis. Patients with diabetes are 
        surviving to an age where vascular disease becomes common. Admission rates 
        averaged 3/1,000 for the 0 to 44 age group and 60/1,000 for the $ 75 age 
        group; bed utilization rates were similar, and costs for the two groups 
        rose from $2,400/1,000 to $181,900/1,000. Increased admissions and bed 
        utilization rates are likely due to an increase in available facilities 
        and changes in treatment practices; the validation study suggests that 
        changes in recording practice by doctors is unlikely to be a major factor. 
        The accuracy of aggregate costs depends on the accuracy of the discharge 
        data, and diabetes has been significantly underreported. 4 tables, 23

        The authors assessed rates and trends of hospitalization for persons with 
        diabetes between 1980 and 1990. Per the NHDS, in 1990, diabetes was listed 
        as a primary or secondary diagnosis for 2.8 million hospitalizations (24.5 
        million hospital days); the proportion of such hospitalizations for which 
        diabetes was listed as the primary diagnosis declined from 29 percent 
        in 1980 to about 15 percent in 1990. In the latter year, for discharges 
        that listed diabetes, only diseases of the circulatory system exceeded 
        diabetes as a primary diagnosis. Per the 1989 NHIS, among adults with 
        diabetes, 8.3 percent reported multiple hospital admissions and 15.5 percent 
        reported a single admission. In the population aged 18 years and over, 
        persons with diabetes were 3 times more likely than those without diabetes 
        to report hospitalization in the previous year. Women with diabetes were 
        6 to 18 percent more likely to report being hospitalized than their male 
        counterparts. Reported single and multiple hospitalization rates were 
        proportionally higher with more diabetes-related complications. In 1990, 
        per the NHDS, 89 percent of admissions with diabetes as a listed diagnosis 
        were of patients aged 45 years or older. Hospitalizations that listed 
        diabetic ketoacidosis increased 27 percent from 1980 to 1990 (age adjusted); 
        hospitalizations for lower extremity amputations related to diabetes rose 
        from about 36,000 to about 54,000 during the period. From 1980 to 1990, 
        the average length of stay when diabetes was the primary diagnosis decreased 
        from 10.5 to 7.8 days. The American Diabetes Association estimated costs 
        associated with hospital care for diabetes to be $37.2 billion in 1992; 
        an estimate by Rubin et al. (1994) put the figure at $55 billion. 19 figures,

        The authors analyzed hospital cost and outcome for 784 adult and pediatric 
        nephrology admissions over a 2-year period at an academic medical center. 
        Seventy-eight of these patients had diabetes mellitus. Hospital costs 
        (excluding physician fees) were calculated by using per-patient charge 
        data and converting charges to costs via the cost-to-charge ratio data 
        used by the hospital. These costs were then compared with DRG reimbursement 
        for all patients using the DRG payment methodology and DRG case-mix index. 
        The 784 nephrology admissions generated approximately $5 million in hospital 
        costs. Patients with diabetes generated significantly higher mean hospital 
        costs, $8,893, than those without diabetes, $6,153 (p &lt; 0.03). For 
        nephrology patients overall, those in age groups 55 years and over would 
        have generated losses relative to DRG payment, peaking at a mean loss 
        of $5,343 for patients aged 85 and over. The deficit was due primarily 
        to more expensive care provided to patients 65 and over. Reimbursement 
        under the DRG system should be made more equitable for patients with diabetes.

        Sixty-one newly diagnosed children with type 1 diabetes took part in this 
        Finnish study, which was based at two Helsinki hospitals: Children's Hospital, 
        University of Helsinki; and the Avrore City Hospital. Thirty-one children 
        were assigned to the short-term group (1-week initial hospital stay) and 
        30 children to the long-term group (4-week initial hospital stay). Metabolic 
        control, psychosocial adjustment, and direct and indirect costs of care 
        were compared during the 2-year follow-up. First-month costs accounted 
        for 74 percent of total costs in the long-term group and 59 percent of 
        total costs in the short-term group. The major first-month expenses were 
        for hospital costs (82 percent in the long-term group and 78 percent in 
        the short-term group). The indirect costs of parents' lost work time, 
        traveling costs, children's living expenses at home, and housekeeping 
        and babysitter assistance, although minimal, were substantially higher 
        during the first month in the long-term group. Other direct costs considered 
        during the 2-year follow-up, including outpatient visits, insulin treatment, 
        home monitoring of blood glucose and urine tests, and diabetic diet, did 
        not differ significantly by group. Overall, total costs were 1.6 times 
        greater in the long-term group. The researchers found no significant differences 
        between the two groups in metabolic control, family adjustment to diabetes, 
        psychosocial measures, or satisfaction with patient education during the 
        2-year follow-up period. They concluded that shortening the average initial 
        hospital stay of children newly diagnosed with diabetes from 23 days to 
        9 days achieved a savings of 36 percent in costs during the first 2 years 
        of the disease without influencing the metabolic or psychosocial outcome 
        of care. 3 tables, 34 references.</font></p>

        The authors studied hospitalization for general medical conditions in 
        patients with diabetes aged 45 years and over. Data were derived from 
        the 1991 National Hospital Discharge Survey and the 1987 National Medical 
        Expenditure Survey. Expenditures attributable to diabetes were estimated 
        by multiplying the excess number of inpatient days for persons with diabetes 
        by the mean per-day inpatient cost. Identification of patients with diabetes 
        was based on primary or secondary diagnosis codes for diabetes; general 
        medical conditions were all those not considered to be acute or chronic 
        complications of diabetes. Costs were inflated to 1991 dollars. Mean expenditures 
        per inpatient day per patient with diabetes were $1,673 for those 45 to 
        64 years old and $1,192 for those 65 and over. Middle-aged persons with 
        diabetes were 60 percent more likely (relative risk, 1.6, 95 percent confidence 
        interval, 1.2-2.0) to be hospitalized for general medical conditions than 
        were persons without diabetes; the greatest relative risks were for peritonitis/intestinal 
        abscess, respiratory failure, liver disease, and male genital disorders. 
        Among the elderly, there was no significant difference between the groups 
        in overall risk of hospitalization for general medical conditions; those 
        with diabetes had elevated risks for liver disease, septicemia, diseases 
        of pulmonary circulation, and various other problems. Middle-aged and 
        elderly persons with diabetes were hospitalized longer than those without 
        diabetes (8.1 versus 6.3 days for Middle-aged and 10.1 versus 8.9 days 
        for elderly patients). Inpatient expenditures attributable to diabetes 
        were $4.12 billion (52.3 percent of this total was for elderly persons). 
        These costs may be understated because they do not account for undiagnosed 
        diabetes among hospitalized patients. 5 tables, 55 references.</font></p>

        The author reviews efforts to reduce expensive inpatient care for people 
        with diabetes. According to one national study, $9,493 was expended per 
        patient with diabetes in 1992, of which $5,885 (more than 63 percent) 
        was for inpatient care; corresponding figures for patients without diabetes 
        were $2,604 and $1,222, respectively. The author describes several programs 
        that have been implemented to reduce inpatient costs for diabetes. Kaiser 
        Permanente of Northern California has developed a database for all patients 
        with diabetes (68,000 in May 1994) that will track costs, compliance, 
        and complication rates. Palmyra Medical Centers in Georgia markets an 
        intensive diabetes intervention and prevention plan to employers, which 
        costs $1,000 per patient with diabetes for the first year and $400 per 
        year thereafter; the program is based on the findings of the Diabetes 
        Control and Complications Trial. Control of blood glucose concentrations 
        is stressed, and the program begins with a 2day intensive education program 
        for newly diagnosed patients. Hemoglobin A1c is tested every 3 months, 
        and additional education is provided if concentrations indicate control 
        problems; blood glucose concentrations have decreased in 99 percent of 
        patients. Support groups meet monthly. Rose Medical Center in Denver has 
        reduced the average length of hospitalization by 1 day per patient with 
        diabetes, for a savings of over $500,000, by implementing intensive case 
        management at admission. The hospital uses its computer system to identify 
        patients with diabetes, then involves a member of the diabetes program 
        in the care of the patient. In Macon, Georgia, a similar program at the 
        Medical Center of Central Georgia that emphasizes inpatient education 
        has reduced length of stay by 1.7 days in 3 years. In Louisville, Kentucky, 
        at Saints Mary and Elizabeth Hospital, nurses from all units meet monthly 
        with diabetes nurse educators to discuss diabetes management problems; 
        hospital stays for patients with diabetes have been reduced by 1.92 days 
        in 2 years. 1 figure.</font></p>

        The authors conducted a longitudinal analysis of costs (in 1996 U.S. dollars) 
        incurred by 321 patients, including 118 with diabetes mellitus, who had 
        surgery for critical leg ischemia in 1987 or 1988 in Malmohus county, 
        Sweden. Surgical procedures, hospitalizations, and hospital treatment 
        costs were assessed from the first procedure until death or for at least 
        six years postoperatively. Only those admissions directly caused by arterial 
        occlusive disease in the lower limbs were included. Admissions to rehabilitation 
        clinics and nursing homes were included, but nursing home stays for those 
        who lived in a nursing home before the surgery and returned to one after 
        the procedure were not. The costs of angiography, implants, intensive 
        care, outpatient care, and orthopedic appliances as well as indirect costs 
        were not included. The initial operation during the inclusion year was 
        a reconstructive vascular procedure for 96 patients, a restorative or 
        other vascular procedure for 111, and a major amputation for 114. Total 
        hospitalization until follow-up in all patients was 37,638 days, of which 
        only 44 percent was in surgical departments. Estimated overall cost for 
        hospital stays was $12.87 million, a mean per-patient cost of $40,103. 
        Overall cost of surgery was estimated to be $2.25 million, a per-patient 
        cost of $7,050. Patients with diabetes had a longer mean total hospital 
        stay (134 versus 108 days, p = 0.009) and a higher estimated mean total 
        hospital cost ($52,000 versus $44,000, p = 0.01) than patients without 
        diabetes. Both groups had a mean of three operations. Patients with diabetes 
        were more likely than those without diabetes to undergo major amputation 
        as the operation (50 percent versus 27 percent) and more often became 
        bilateral amputees than patients without diabetes (28 percent versus 12

        Medical files were obtained retrospectively on all patients with type

        was collected on sex, age, number of bed days per admission, and reasons 
        for admission. The direct cost of a bed day and an admission for diabetes 
        in this hospital were calculated using a small sample. Two hundred forty-one 
        children with type 1 diabetes had 351 admissions over the 3 years; 105 
        stays were for newly diagnosed children. Of these 105 children, 14 (13.3 
        percent) had additional admissions during this period. Of the 246 admissions 
        for previously diagnosed children, stabilization of high blood glucose 
        was a cause for 145 (59.0 percent); other leading causes were a medical 
        reason (32.5 percent) and education (25.6 percent). The cost of a bed

        The author evaluated the epidemiology of precipitants of hospitalization 
        for type 1 diabetes in Rhode Island and the effectiveness of outpatient 
        education in reducing hospitalizations. A statewide registry of patients 
        with type 1 diabetes was used to identify and characterize the epidemiology 
        of patients admitted to Rhode Island hospitals. Data on precipitating 
        factors were obtained via a review of medical records and physician interviews. 
        During the study period (April 1978 through March 1983), there were 1,344 
        hospital admissions for type 1 diabetes among 887 persons below age 30. 
        Patients with known diabetes accounted for 1,123 admissions (691 persons). 
        Poor diabetes control (noncompliance with diet/medication) or infection 
        accounted for 54 percent and 44 percent of single and multiple admissions, 
        respectively. Admissions for pregnancy care and for various conditions 
        (e.g., myocardial infarction, stroke) were the next most frequent precipitants 
        of hospitalization. An intensive 10-hour outpatient education program 
        with two follow-up sessions was evaluated in 100 patients; the program 
        reduced the number of hospitalizations by 51 percent. Based on a direct 
        cost for hospitalization of $2,400, the potential savings of the educational 
        intervention for those admitted with known diabetes were estimated at 
        $674,000 (cost of admission x admissions for poor diabetes control or 
        infection x 50 percent for educational effect). The cost of the education 
        program was only about $100 per patient. 2 tables, 1 figure, 10 references.</font></p>

        The authors evaluated hospital charges and major causes of hospitalization 
        for diabetic ketoacidosis and nonketotic hyperosmolar state, the major 
        acute emergencies of diabetes mellitus, at a large public hospital. Medical 
        insurance coverage associations with availability of primary care and 
        hospitalization charges were also examined. Data were derived from a retrospective 
        search of hospital admissions for diabetic ketoacidosis and nonketotic 
        hyperosmolar state over a 30-month period from 1989-1991. Hospitalization 
        and emergency room charges were compiled from medical records review. 
        Over the study period, 247 admissions for diabetic ketoacidosis and nonketotic 
        hyperosmolar state were identified; uninsured admissions accounted for 
        49 percent. Only 6 percent of patients in the uninsured group identified 
        a primary care provider, as compared with 85 percent of the insured group. 
        Un-insured patients accounted for a majority of emergency room visits 
        and 52 percent of emergency room charges. However, average hospital charges 
        (exclusive of physician fees) were significantly less in the uninsured

        were much more likely to have been hospitalized because they lacked access 
        to medication and much less likely to be hospitalized because of late

        The authors studied inpatient care for persons with chronic renal failure, 
        including those with end-stage renal disease as well as those who had 
        not reached that stage, using 1991 data from the Medicare End-Stage Renal 
        Disease program, the National Health Interview Survey, the U.S. Census, 
        and the National Hospital Discharge Survey. If chronic renal failure was 
        the primary discharge diagnosis, all charges were included; a portion 
        of the charges was included if chronic renal failure was a secondary diagnosis. 
        In 1991, patients with renal failure had 348,962 hospitalizations, of 
        which 64 percent were for either chronic renal failure or 1 of 15 comorbid 
        conditions (e.g., vascular access problems, congestive heart failure). 
        Patients aged 65 years and older accounted for 57.6 percent of these hospitalizations 
        but 63.0 percent of the inpatient days. The renal failure population averaged 
        1.4 hospitalizations in 1991. Compared with persons without renal failure, 
        the age-adjusted relative risk of hospitalization for persons with renal 
        failure was 10 for all causes, 201.5 for vascular access problems, 32.4 
        for congestive heart failure, 31.3 for pulmonary edema/respiratory failure, 
        23.4 for gastrointestinal hemorrhage, 21.7 for diabetes, 19.2 for sepsis/septicemia, 
        15.6 for electrolyte disorders, 12.4 for hypertension, 10.4 for anemia, 
        and 10.3 for myocardial infarction. Length of stay was significantly longer 
        (mean difference: 0.9 days) than in those without renal failure. Patients 
        with renal failure consumed 1.5 million hospital days, for a total cost 
        of $2.2 billion; of this amount, $291 million was directly for chronic 
        renal failure. Hospitalization for vascular access problems cost $168 
        million; for congestive heart failure, $142 million. 6 tables, 46 references.</font></p>

      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>RECOMMENDATION:</b> 
        Future studies of ketoacidosis in adults should focus on criteria for 
        admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), optimum time to move patients 
        out of the ICU, and the etiology and prevention of recurrent ketoacidosis 
        in women.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>ABSTRACT:</b> 
        The authors examined the records of 40 women and 25 men with diabetes 
        who were hospitalized a total of 92 times with ketoacidosis (serum glucose 
        greater than 200 mg/dL, positive serum or urine ketones, and evidence 
        of metabolic acidosis). The cases were analyzed by initial level of nursing 
        care (ICU, stepdown, general); the three fatalities were excluded from 
        analysis of the correlates of length of stay or cost. Mean days of hospitalization 
        and total costs (with standard deviations) were 6.3 (5.3) and $12,286 
        ($12,096) for the ICU group, 4.4 (3.0) and $6,804 ($3,759) for intermediate 
        care, and 6.0 (6.0) and $7,357 ($6,902) for general care. Patients with 
        concurrent infection had significantly longer stays than those who were 
        culture-negative (9.1 " 6.8 days versus 4.5 " 3.2 days). Shorter length 
        of stay was correlated with care by a diabetologist, shorter interval 
        from presentation until time to administration of an intermediate- or 
        long-acting insulin, and time of day of the initial presentation. In-hospital 
        recurrences of ketoacidosis occurred less frequently in patients managed 
        by a diabetologist (30 versus 47 percent of cases) and were correlated 
        with longer hospitalization. Rapid initial correction of hyperglycemia 
        and acidemia did not correlate with reduced resource usage. Level of care 
        did not affect outcome; if all cases were treated at the intermediate 
        level, an overall savings of $2,292 per case would have been realized. 
        The authors conclude that admission to the ICU is indicated for patients 
        with a concurrent diagnosis that would require intensive care (e.g., myocardial 
        infarction) or if the ketoacidosis is grade 4 (the highest grade). They 
        project resource savings of $60 to $90 million yearly from reducing the 
        level of diabetic ketoacidosis in females to the level in males. 4 tables,
