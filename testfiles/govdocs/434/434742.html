<li><b><u><big>Notes from the October meeting</big></u></b>:<br /><br />
On Thursday, October 16, 2003 we had a joint meeting with the DC, UMD and FDA chapters of Sigma Xi. The meeting, held in the Animal Sciences building at the University of Maryland, began with a delicious Italian dinner and good conversation. After dinner, we adjourned to a nearby lecture hall where we heard a wonderful talk by Dr. Ronald Rodriguez, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. The title of his talk was "The future of Gene Therapy for Prostate Cancer". <br /><br />
 
I am certainly not an authority in this area and some of the men in the audience, by experience, had much more knowledge about the subject matter than I do. Dr. Rodriquez noted the prostate and the seminal vesicles are embryonically the same, however, prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in men, but there are only 20 cases of seminal vesicle cancer worldwide. They are so similar and yet so very different. Prostate specific antigen (PSA) is unique to the prostate and therefore is a very important marker for prostate cancer. Normal PSA levels often range between 0.2 and 4.0 ng/ml. Prostate cancer has been diagnosed in patients with values between 2 and 10 ng/ml.  It is estimated that 1 in every 6 men over 50 have elevated PSA. Prostate cancer is slow growing with the time to death from prostate cancer averaging about 15 -17 years. It is also a very treatable cancer. However, if it metastasizes outside the prostate, there is no cure.  The PSA test measures both bound and unbound or free PSA (F/T PSA). If the free PSA is less than 20% of the total, then your risk of prostate cancer increases. In general, men should begin monitoring their PSA levels by the age of 40 - 50, and earlier if there is a family history or prostate cancer. Most prostate cancers are hormone sensitive and therefore respond to androgen deprivation. However, others are androgen-independent and result in more virulent form of the disease. The current treatments for prostate cancer may include a combination of hormonal therapies, surgery and radiation. Other types of treatments for prostate cancer are being investigated. Some examples of chemotherapeutic agents discussed included mitoxantrone, estramustin and taxanes. Some of the complementary treatments for prostate cancer discussed included adding selenium, zinc, vitamin E and phytoestrogens to the diet. These complementary treatments have only been shown to be effective in cell culture studies.<br /><br />
 
Molecular medicine uses changes in specific genes to give products that can reverse or cure cancer or a disease. The therapy can be used both <i>ex vivo</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Dr. Rodriquez described his work involved in the development of three experimental therapeutics for urological malignancies, including the treatment of advanced prostate cancer with gene therapy vectors. The three different approaches that have been conducted include a vaccine, adenovirus vectors (CV706) using beads as delivery vehicle, autologus and allergenic vaccine products (injection into the prostate). CV706 is a prostate specific antigen-selective, replication-competent adenovirus. In a phase I clinical trial, they evaluated its toxicity and antitumor activity in prostate cancer patients.  Some of these approaches were insensitive; some were inefficient; some produced only transient effects producing a drop in PSA in only a few cases. Even though these researchers were able to get the virus to replicate, none of the volunteer patients survived their prostate cancer. <br /><br /></li>
 
<li><b><u><big>Next FDA Chapter Meeting</big></u></b><br /><br />
 
Our next meeting is on <b><u><big>Friday, November 7, 2003</big></u></b>. Other local Sigma Xi Chapter Members and guests have been also invited to this meeting. <b><big>Dr. Ted Rockwell</big></b>, a Sigma Xi Distinguished Lecturer, will give a lecture on <b><big>Facts and Myths about Ionizing Radiation and Nuclear Technology</big></b>.  He will also include an interactive discussion in his presentation. The meeting and lecture be held in the Harvey W. Wiley Building auditorium, room 1A-003, at the Center for Food Safety and Applied Technology (CFSAN), College Park, Maryland from 3:30 p.m. to 5:00 p.m.
 
<blockquote><b><u>Brief Bio</u></b>: Dr. Theodore is an often-requested Sigma Xi Distinguished Lecturer, Fellow of the American Nuclear Society, recipient of the first ANS Lifetime Contribution Award, and a member of the National Academy of Engineering, Ted has been awarded Distinguished Service Medals from both The Navy and the Atomic Energy Commission. He is author of several books, technical papers and articles on radiation and nuclear power, including the standard text Reactor Shielding Design Manual. He was technical director of Admiral Hyman Rickover's program to build the nuclear Navy and the world's first commercial atomic power station at Shippingport, PA.<br /><br />
 
Dr. Rockwell has been involved with nuclear power for many years, ranging from working on the atomic bomb project at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, to developing designs for safe operation of nuclear powered naval vessels, to developing the first commercial central station nuclear power plant. He is founding officer of the engineering firm MPR Associates, Inc. and of Radiation, Science and Health Inc., an international organization of independent radiation experts committed to bringing radiation policy in line with the best scientific data.</blockquote>
