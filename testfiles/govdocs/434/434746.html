<p>
Within just a few short years the Hugo Wolf Quartett has developed from a chamber music lover&#39;s insider tip to one of the most sought after string quartets of its generation. 
</p>

<p>
The Hugo Wolf Quartett was founded at the Vienna Conservatory. 
Shortly thereafter, the four young musicians won the Fifth International String Quartet Competition in Cremona and took first prize at the 45th International G.B. Viotti Chamber Music Competition, the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra Special Prize, and the European Cultural Award for Chamber Music, and made their debut at the Vienna Konzerthaus, a moment that was celebrated by public and press alike.
</p>

<p>
The Hugo Wolf Quartett has concretized for over ten years in the most prominent concert halls and renowned festivals such as the Concertgebouw Amsterdam, Philharmonie Berlin and Cologne, the Palais des Beaux-Arts Brussels, Symphony Hall Birmingham, Wigmore Hall London, Carnegie Hall New York, Suntory Hall Tokyo, Herkulessaal Munich, Tonhalle Zurich, Rudolfinum Prague, Mozarteum Salzburg, Musikverein and Konzerthaus Vienna, Edinburgh Festival, Gidon Kremer's Lockenhaus Festival, Schubertiade Feldkirch, Carinthian Summer, L&#39;&eacute;t&eacute; musical dans la vall&eacute;e du Lot, Colmar Festival, and many others. 
Extensive concert tours regularly take the ensemble to North and South America, Mexico, Japan, and elsewhere.
For its tenth anniversary the Hugo Wolf Quartett established its own cycle in the Konzerthaus in Vienna. Composers Zbigniew Bargielski, Friedrich Cerha and Erich Urbanner wrote and dedicated these works especially for this occasion. The quartet's repertoire spans across the two Viennese Schools and has performed a number of world premieres which received high critical acclaim. In addition they have ventured into including the attractive Jazz work by Kenny Wheeler into their programs.
In 2007 Gidon Kremer invited the quartet to his Festival Lockenhaus and chose Bartok&#39;s Quartet #4 to be performed again on the season finale concert. 
The Hugo Wolf Quartett has recorded for the Gramola, Atlantis Art and Extraplatte Labels, and appeared on numerous radio and television productions such as the BBC, Radio Berlin, KBS, ORF. They were awarded the ORF-Pasticcio Prize for Beethoven&#39;s op.18/4 and op.132.

&quot;Urgent and impassioned, but with an absolute commitment to the ideal values of every note&quot;

&quot;One hears in these players, embryonically and in miniature, the qualities that make the Vienna Philharmonic special&quot;
