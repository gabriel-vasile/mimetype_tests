        <blockquote> 
          <p>NSF and NASA will cooperate to fund projects that will promote
            the ability to design, test, implement, evolve, and certify highly
            dependable software-based systems. A significant feature of this
            solicitation is the use of a new NASA test-bed facility that will
            allow NSF awardees
            to experimentally evaluate their research products on significant
            real hardware/software artifacts.</p>
          <p> Proposals of up to $160,000 per year for up to 4 years are sought
            from eligible organizations, as described in the NSF Grant Proposal
            Guide.
            Proposal evaluation will be done by a standard NSF&nbsp;merit review
            process followed by a NASA evaluation for appropriateness and relevance
            to NASA objectives. (See the full "Program Description" for details
            on the NASA evaluation and objectives.) </p>
          <P>Because the solicitation
              seeks projects that combine the development of ideas and techniques
              with the execution of empirical studies and experimental validation
              using the NASA test-bed facility, funding will be provided through
              a combination of NSF grants and NASA cooperative agreements. Projects
              successful in receiving an NSF award will still have to apply for
              funding for test-bed activities by submitting an additional proposal
              to NASA during the first year of the NSF award. The primary evaluation
              criteria for awarding NASA cooperative agreements will be the perceived
              effectiveness of the planned empirical evaluation using the NASA
              test-bed facilities and the development of a working collaboration
              with other researchers on the NASA test-bed facilities. &nbsp;Please
              read Sections II. "Program Description" and IV. "Award Information" for
              details on this funding strategy.</P>
          <P>The two agencies
              intend to fund additional new cycles of awards beginning in each
              of the following fiscal years, contingent on the availability of
              funds and the success of the competitions.</P>

      <h3>I. INTRODUCTION</h3>
      <div class="user_input">
        <P>The growing need for software-based systems that
            can be used with confidence (that the systems will behave as expected
            and will do no harm) mandates extraordinary efforts in software and
            systems research. Several programs at NSF and NASA already support
            research and education activities that address these issues, but
            none is focused, as is this solicitation, entirely on the goal of
            providing the means to create highly dependable software and networking-based
            systems. Another unique feature of this solicitation is the requirement
            for projects to use a new NASA test-bed facility to experimentally
            evaluate research products on significant real hardware/software
            artifacts. It is expected that these features will attract novel
            and high quality proposals, leading to the funding of projects that
            will have a significant and measurable effect on our ability to build
            the dependable systems the future requires.</P>
        <P>The overall goal of this solicitation is to develop
            a scientific basis for measurable and predictable dependability in
            software-based computing and communication systems, and a scientific
            basis - comparable to those in physics-based engineering disciplines
            - for technologies or methodologies to improve dependability in these
            systems. If this is successful, then it is anticipated that government
            agencies as well as US industry will have a scientific basis for
            dependably using software-based systems, and for using technology
            interventions to achieve a predictable level of dependability. The
            key to this scientific feasibility is clearly defined attributes
            that can be objectively measured. Dependability attributes should
            encompass both aspects relevant to the dependability of deployed
            computing systems and attributes that can be measured before deployment:
            for example the complexity of interfaces between subsystems or the
            results of necessarily limited testing prior to deployment. </P>
        <P>A successful scientific demonstration would show
            that objective, dependability attributes that are measurable before
            deployment can be used to predict measurable, dependability attributes
            of deployed systems; similarly, a successful technology or methodology
            demonstration would show that a technology or methodology has a measurable
            impact on the dependability of deployed systems, and this impact
            can be predicted before deployment. It is expected that most successful
            proposals will have four elements: fundamental research and associated
            educational activities, prototype technology or methodology, dependability
            metrics, and an experimental approach.&nbsp; In addition, all NSF
            proposals are expected to show how the project intends to&nbsp;integrate
            research and educational goals.</P>

        <P>Under this solicitation, proposals may be submitted
                  with a duration of 4 years or less, and a total budget of $640,000
                  or less--about $160,000 per year. Part of each proposal must set
                  forth plans for use of the NASA test bed, and part of the pre-award
                  negotiations and post-award monitoring will be directed at assuring
                  the effectiveness of this collaboration. Because the solicitation
                  seeks projects that combine the development of ideas and techniques
                  with the execution of empirical studies and experimental validation
                  using the NASA test-bed facility, funding will be provided through
                  a combination of NSF grants and NASA cooperative agreements running
                  concurrently. PIs are encouraged to submit NSF proposals describing
                  a complete project with a full budget request for all proposed work
                  for up to four years; NSF awards, however, will fully pay the first
                  year only, up to $160,000, and then pay reduced amounts in years
                  two through four. NASA funding, in the form of a cooperative agreement,
                  would complete the total of up to $160,000 for each of the years
                  two through four of the project. This NASA funding will be contingent
                  on favorable evaluation of a separate proposal for test-bed usage,
                  submitted to NASA after the first three months of performance on
                  the NSF grant, but no later than the end of the first year of the
                  NSF award period. The primary evaluation criteria for awarding NASA
                  cooperative agreements will be the perceived effectiveness of the
                  planned empirical evaluation using the NASA test-bed facilities,
                  and the development of a working collaboration with other researchers
                  on the NASA test-bed facilities. It is expected that the great majority
                  of projects funded by NSF under this solicitation will receive&nbsp;coordinated
                  NASA cooperative agreement awards that would run concurrently with
        years 2 through 4 of the NSF grant.</P>

      <div class="user_input">
        <P>NSF anticipates spending $1,600,000 of combined NSF and NASA funds
          in FY 2003 for Standard&nbsp;and Continuing Grants up to a maximum&nbsp;of
          four years, pending the availability of funds. This money covers new
          awards and continuations of previous awards under HDCCSR. Similarly,
          in years FY 2004 and beyond, NSF anticipates spending between $1,600,000
          and $2,400,000 each year of combined NSF and NASA funds on new and
          continued awards.&nbsp; This will result in about 5 new awards per
          year.&nbsp; All grants will be structured under the assumption that
          the projects funded will also receive coordinated awards in the form
          of cooperative agreements from NASA. These NASA awards would begin
          in the second year of the NSF award (FY 2004 for NSF awards made in
          FY 2003) and continue for the remaining duration of the NSF award,
          usually FY 2004 through FY 2006 for NSF awards made in FY 2003. The
          combined total of the NSF grant and the NASA cooperative agreement
          awarded to a project will not exceed $160,000 per year for up to 4
          years. Estimated program budget, number of awards and average award
          size/duration are subject to the availability of funds.</P>

      <h3>VI. PROPOSAL REVIEW INFORMATION</h3>
      <a name="reviewcrit"></a>
      <h4>A. NSF Proposal Review Process</h4>
      <a name="reviewproc"></a>
      <p>Reviews of proposals submitted to NSF are solicited from peers with
        expertise in the substantive area of the proposed research or education
        project. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with
        the oversight of the review process. NSF invites the proposer to suggest,
        at the time of submission, the names of appropriate or inappropriate
        reviewers. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts with
        the proposer. Special efforts are made to recruit reviewers from non-academic
        institutions, minority-serving institutions, or adjacent disciplines
        to that principally addressed in the proposal.</p>
      <p>The National Science Board approved revised criteria for evaluating
        proposals at its meeting on March 28, 1997 (<a href="http://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/getpub?nsb9772">NSB
        97-72</a>). All NSF proposals
        are evaluated through use of the two merit review criteria. In some instances,
        however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight
        the specific objectives of certain programs and activities. </p>
      <p>On July 8, 2002, the NSF Director issued <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/getpub?iin127">Important
          Notice 127</a>, Implementation
        of new Grant Proposal Guide Requirements Related to the Broader Impacts
        Criterion. This Important Notice reinforces the importance of addressing
        both criteria in the preparation and review of all proposals submitted
        to NSF. NSF continues to strengthen its internal processes to ensure
        that both of the merit review criteria are addressed when making funding
        decisions.</p>
      <p>In an effort to increase compliance with these requirements, the January
        2002 issuance of the GPG incorporated revised proposal preparation guidelines
        relating to the development of the Project Summary and Project Description.
        Chapter II of the GPG specifies that Principal Investigators (PIs) must
        address both merit review criteria in separate statements within the
        one-page Project Summary. This chapter also reiterates that broader impacts
        resulting from the proposed project must be addressed in the Project
        Description and described as an integral part of the narrative.</p>
      <p>Effective October 1, 2002, NSF will return without review proposals
        that do not separately address both merit review criteria within the
        Project Summary. It is believed that these changes to NSF proposal preparation
        and processing guidelines will more clearly articulate the importance
        of broader impacts to NSF-funded projects.</p>
      <p>The two National Science Board approved merit review criteria are listed
        below (see the <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?gpg">Grant
        Proposal Guide</a> Chapter III.A for further information). The criteria
        include considerations that help define them. These considerations are
        suggestions and not all will apply to any given proposal. While proposers
        must address both merit review criteria, reviewers will be asked to address
        only those considerations that are relevant to the proposal being considered
        and for which he/she is qualified to make judgments.</p>
      <ul>
        <b>What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity?</b><br />
        How important is the proposed activity to advancing knowledge and understanding
        within its own field or across different fields? How well qualified is
        the proposer (individual or team) to conduct the project? (If appropriate,
        the reviewer will comment on the quality of the prior work.) To what
        extent does the proposed activity suggest and explore creative and original
        concepts? How well conceived and organized is the proposed activity?
        Is there sufficient access to resources?
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <b>What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?</b><br />
        How well does the activity advance discovery and understanding while
        promoting teaching, training, and learning? How well does the proposed
        activity broaden the participation of underrepresented groups (e.g.,
        gender, ethnicity, disability, geographic, etc.)? To what extent will
        it enhance the infrastructure for research and education, such as facilities,
        instrumentation, networks, and partnerships? Will the results be disseminated
        broadly to enhance scientific and technological understanding? What may
        be the benefits of the proposed activity to society?
      </ul>
      <p>NSF staff will give careful consideration to the following in making
        funding decisions:</p>
      <ul>
        <i><b>Integration of Research and Education</b></i><br />
        One of the principal strategies in support of NSF's goals is to foster
        integration of research and education through the programs, projects,
        and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These
        institutions provide abundant opportunities where individuals may concurrently
        assume responsibilities as researchers, educators, and students and where
        all can engage in joint efforts that infuse education with the excitement
        of discovery and enrich research through the diversity of learning perspectives.        <i><b>Integrating Diversity into NSF Programs, Projects, and Activities</b></i><br />
        Broadening opportunities and enabling the participation of all citizens
        -- women and men, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities
        -- is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering.
        NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central
        to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.        
        <p><span class="user_input"> <a name="rev_addl_crit_txt"></a> <b>Additional

        <p><span class="user_input">        In addition to the standard NSF review criteria, proposals will be judged

                facility.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </ul>
      <a name="reviewprot"></a>
      <h4>B. Review Protocol and Associated Customer Service Standard</h4>
      <p>All proposals are carefully reviewed by at least three other persons
        outside NSF who are experts in the particular field represented by the
        proposal. Proposals submitted in response to this announcement/solicitation
        will be reviewed by <span class="user_input"> <a id="rev_meth_txt" name="rev_meth_txt"></a> Ad
        Hoc and/or panel review. </span></p>
      <p>Reviewers will be asked to formulate a recommendation to either support
        or decline each proposal. The Program Officer assigned to manage the
        proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate
        a recommendation.</p>
      <p>A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted
        by each reviewer. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents.
        Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers, are
        sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Director.
        In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision
        to award or decline funding.</p>
      <p>NSF is striving to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals
        have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. The
        time interval begins on the date of receipt. The interval ends when the
        Division Director accepts the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
      <p>In all cases, after programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals
        recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and
        Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications
        and the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers
        are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments,
        obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of
        funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical
        or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator
        or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the
        absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants
        and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>

      <h3>VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION</h3>
      <a name="awardnotify"></a>
      <h4>A. Notification of the Award</h4>
      <p> Notification of the award is made to<i> the submitting organization</i> by
        a Grants Officer in the Division of Grants and Agreements. Organizations
        whose proposals are declined will be advised as promptly as possible
        by the cognizant NSF Program Division administering the program. Verbatim
        copies of reviews, not including the identity of the reviewer, will be
        provided automatically to the Principal Investigator. (See section VI.A.
        for additional information on the review process.) </p>
      <a name="grantcond"></a>
      <h4>B. Award Conditions</h4>
      <p> An NSF award consists of: (1) the award letter, which includes any
        special provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments
        thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of
        expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates
        any specific approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3)
        the proposal referenced in the award letter; (4) the applicable award
        conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (NSF-GC-1); * or Federal
        Demonstration Partnership (FDP) Terms and Conditions * and (5) any announcement
        or other NSF issuance that may be incorporated by reference in the award
        letter. Cooperative agreement awards also are administered in accordance
        with NSF Cooperative Agreement Terms and Conditions (CA-1). Electronic
        mail notification is the preferred way to transmit NSF awards to organizations
        that have electronic mail capabilities and have requested such notification
        from the Division of Grants and Agreements. </p>
      <p> *These documents may be accessed electronically on NSF's Website at <a 
  href="http://www.nsf.gov/home/grants/grants_gac.htm"> http://www.nsf.gov/home/grants/grants_gac.htm</a>.
        Paper copies may be obtained from the NSF Publications Clearinghouse,
        telephone (301) 947-2722 or by e-mail from <a 
  href="mailto:pubs@nsf.gov">pubs@nsf.gov</a>. </p>
      <p> More comprehensive information on NSF Award Conditions is contained
        in the NSF <i>Grant Policy Manual</i> (GPM) Chapter II, available electronically
        on the NSF Website at <a

      <p><b>Special Award Conditions:</b></p>
      </p>
      <div class="user_input"><a name="grnt_addl_awd_cond_txt"></a> Standard
        NSF award conditions apply to the NSF awards under this solicitation;
        however, if a project also receives a coordinated award from NASA, the
        NASA award will be governed by cooperative agreements with NASA following
        NASA guidelines found in the Grants and Cooperative Agreement Handbook
        NPG 5800.1. (The online handbook is available at <A href="http://ec.msfc.nasa.gov/hq/grcover.htm">http://ec.msfc.nasa.gov/hq/grcover.htm</A>).
        In this case, the NSF and NASA awards support a single research effort,
        but investigators must understand that the budgets and their accounts
        are separate and must be managed and accounted for separately.</div>
      <a name="reportreq"></a>
      <h4>C. Reporting Requirements</h4>
      <p> For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants),
        the PI must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program
        Officer at least 90 days before the end of the current budget period. </p>
      <a name="grnt_addl_rpt_req_txt"></a>
      <p> Within 90 days after the expiration of an award, the PI also is required
        to submit a final project report. Failure to provide final technical
        reports delays NSF review and processing of pending proposals for the
        PI and all Co-PIs. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports
        in advance to assure availability of required data. </p>
      <p> PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project reporting system,
        available through FastLane, for preparation and submission of annual
        and final project reports. This system permits electronic submission
        and updating of project reports, including information on project participants
        (individual and organizational), activities and findings, publications,
        and other specific products and contributions. PIs will not be required
        to re-enter information previously provided, either with a proposal or
        in earlier updates using the electronic system. </p>

      </div>      <h3>ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</h3>
      <p> The National Science Foundation (NSF) funds research and education
        in most fields of science and engineering. Awardees are wholly responsible
        for conducting their project activities and preparing the results for
        publication. Thus, the Foundation does not assume responsibility for
        such findings or their interpretation. </p>
      <p> NSF welcomes proposals from all qualified scientists, engineers and
        educators. The Foundation strongly encourages women, minorities and persons
        with disabilities to compete fully in its programs. In accordance with
        Federal statutes, regulations and NSF policies, no person on grounds
        of race, color, age, sex, national origin or disability shall be excluded
        from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to
        discrimination under any program or activity receiving financial assistance
        from NSF, although some programs may have special requirements that limit
        eligibility.</p>
      <p><i>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</i> (FASED)
        provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons
        with disabilities (investigators and other staff, including student research
        assistants) to work on NSF-supported projects. See the GPG Chapter II,
        Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of
