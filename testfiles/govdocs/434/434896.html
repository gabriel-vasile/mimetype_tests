<p><a href="#LIST"><font size="3">THE TOP TEN - PRIORITIZED
MEASURABLE CRITERIA</font></a></p>

<p><font size="3">These criteria are derived with little
modification from the work of the Space Propulsion Synergy Group
(1993). Although they are in priority order they should generally
be used as a group to evaluate directions (concepts, technologies
to invest in, strategies).</font></p>

<p><a href="#CRITERIA"><font size="3">THE CRITERIA - A WALKDOWN</font></a></p>

<p><font size="3">A brief walk through the meaning of the
criteria. Going from the broad view at 20,000 feet and onward
down to ground level meaning. The examples provided should not be
considered the only derivable solutions. They are merely possible
directions that would incorporate many of the lessons of Shuttle.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>THE CRITERIA - A WALKDOWN</b></font></p>

<p><a name="INTRO"><font size="3"></font></a><font size="3"> <b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3"><img src="Nexgen_Images/BANG_ARR.gif"
width="20" height="20"> The previous criteria are in no way
complete. The need to eliminate the need for any purges on the
vehicle or ground, the need to eliminate closed compartments, the
need to increase accessibility for any repair (hopefully very
rare) are all important. As criteria these would be &quot;reduce
the number of purges&quot; or &quot;reduce the mean time to
access&quot;. However, the Top 10 are likely among the most
important lessons that must be incorporated into next generation
design.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">These Top 10 are intended as high level
strategies. They are also spaceholders for further, more
detailed, information. If possible, as this more detailed
information is surfaced and organized, it may be placed at this
site at some time in the future.</font></p>

<hr>

<p><a name="CRIT1"><font size="3"></font></a></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Responsiveness: Primarily ease of
Supportability and Maintainability</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>1) Minimize the number of separate vehicle
systems, subsystems, GSE and facilities.</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">This is the same as reducing the number of
different propulsion systems. It is basically a statement that
above all comes the need for simplicity in design.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">For example, vehicle tankage and architecture.
The simplest architecture will be to have all tanks at zero
level. No LOX tanks forward. This eliminates long feeds and leak
paths, eliminates the need for a ground pump system for LOX
facilities, eliminates geysering concerns, eliminates active
systems such as GHe inject, makes conditioning easier, greatly
increases the start box on the propulsion and enables greater
modularization, greatly simplifying all propulsion by reduced
parts count (complexity) and increasing mission reliability as
well as supportability.</font></p>

<p><a name="CRIT2"><font size="3"></font></a><font size="3"> <b>Dependable
and Reliable</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>2) Minimize the number of potential leakage
sources.</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">This references architecture and technology.
For example, long feeds being avoided would be an architectural
solution (synergy with Criteria 1). A technological solution
could be better, leak free joints (welding techniques, seal
designs). Another technological solution would be the entire
elimination of a fluid system such as using electromechanical
actuators instead of fluid hydraulics, or flywheels instead of
hydrazine auxiliary power units. Self contained hydraulic
actuation could also score positively in this area.</font></p>

<p><a name="CRIT3"><font size="3"></font></a><font size="3"> <b>Affordability:
Primarily Recurring Cost</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>3) Minimize the number of hands-on
activities required (to handle, assemble, verify functionally,
checkout, service, launch, flight operate, land, secure, safe,
etc...)</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">This is basically another
&quot;elimination&quot; criteria. For example, if an umbilical or
interface is eliminated or one concept has fewer than another
(all other things being equal) then this criteria is improved
upon. An automation approach could work similarly (better) versus
a system with marginally fewer interfaces to assemble by hand.</font></p>

<p><a name="CRIT4"><font size="3"></font></a><font size="3"> <b>Dependable
and Reliable</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>4) Minimize the number of different fluids
used.</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">This criteria could apply at various level. The
count could include all the way down to precision cleaning fluids
for example. However, with propulsion and related ground systems
being drivers the criteria is basically about eliminating major
propulsion system fluids. For example, substituting LO2/LH2 for
hypergolics or flywheels for power or EMA's for hydraulics. Do
not add third propellants (tripropellants go against this
criteria as well as previous ones). A monopropellant, even if
different than the MPS propellants, is an improvement over
separate fuel and oxidizer.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">At a lower level this means common propellants
for MPS and OMS/RCS. The full intent is to integrate as well.
Common tankage, lines and subsystems for MPS and OMS/RCS as well
as thermal management and fuel cells.</font></p>

<p><a name="CRIT5"><font size="3"></font></a><font size="3"> <b>Dependable
and Reliable</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>5) Minimize the number of active components
required to test and function.</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">An example here is the GHe Interseal purge
required on SSME's. An oxidizer rich combustion cycle would
eliminate the need for this active system. GHe Inject being
eliminated through elimination of long feedlines is another
example. A flare stack being substituted by an air mixer would
have one active system replaced by another but the use of
catalytic cumbustors could be an avenue toward elimination of an
active system by replacement with a passive one.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Again, although specifically a concept or
technology may be favored in one &quot;lesson learned&quot; over
another it is important to maintain a whole system perspective
and measure up possible directions against the entire gamut of
criteria. Being a high score against the top 10 indicates a
concept could easily outweigh lack of benefit in other less
important criteria.</font></p>

<p><a name="CRIT6"><font size="3"></font></a><font size="3"> <b>Dependable
and Reliable</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>6) Maximize the use of components with
demonstrated high reliability.</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">Basically this is about rigorous certification,
also called qualification. A high reliability gained through the
application of manpower is not the intent here. For example, SSME
components have a high mission reliability but low support
reliability (also called dependability; any and all cases
requiring support, especially on the ground.) This means lack of
supportability. This means lack of affordability.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Low cycle fatigue (on/off) and high cycle
fatigue (duration) testing of designs with an iterative focus on
reuse (many cycles and high endurance between any action,
maintenance, repair or otherwise) is required for next generation
systems affordability.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">For example, valves for opening and closing as
well as sealing would be tested for next generation systems well
beyond what is required for mission reliability. Design and
iteration of designs would focus on the turnaround activity being
eliminated by having had qualification to failure as well as to
extremes of operation. A secondary benefit is better
understanding of the degree of conservatism (or not) required in
the usage of a system.</font></p>

<p><a name="CRIT7"><font size="3"></font></a><font size="3"> <b>Responsiveness:
Primarily ease of Supportability and Maintainability</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>7) Minimize the number of active systems
required to maintain a safe vehicle.</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">An example here is the elimination of purges
which is required for closed compartments. Attempts should be
made to minimize the enclosed spaces. The GSE required to support
these systems as well as the interfaces that these require are
another point that is improved when the purges are eliminated.</font></p>

<p><a name="CRIT8"><font size="3"></font></a><font size="3"> <b>Dependable
and Reliable</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>8) Minimize the number of systems requiring
monitoring because of hazards.</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">Similar to the prior criteria. A hazardous gas
detection system is required for closed compartments such as an
orbiter aft or an external tank intertank. Also reference
criteria number 2.</font></p>

<p><a name="CRIT9"><font size="3"></font></a><font size="3"> <b>Responsiveness:
Primarily ease of Supportability and Maintainability</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>9) Maximize automation, autonomy and
BIT/BITE.</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">This is basically a manpower issue. Launch
control centers or mission control centers with hundreds of
people for a handful of flights per year correspond to a low
productivity. Harvesting commercial off the shelf (COTS)
computational capabilities and matching with a correspondingly
robust, reliable and dependable design could eliminate the
current manpower intensive paradigm.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Another example is in criticality. Hazardous
gas detection will have to advance toward hazardous gas
&quot;location&quot;. Current troubleshooting and detection is
manpower intensive and time consuming. For instance, a leak is
known to exist but can only be located via manpower intensive
techniques. This is an opportunity for automation. A rapid
&quot;switch on/off&quot; that indicates health of fluid systems
and also indicates precisely where (if any) problems exist is
required.</font></p>

<p><a name="CRIT10"><font size="3"></font></a><font size="3"> <b>Responsiveness:
Primarily ease of Supportability and Maintainability</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>10) Minimize the number of interfaces
requiring engineering control.</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">This refers not only to physical interfaces (a
T-O interface for example) but to the organizational interfaces
that design interfaces engender. Facility to vehicle interfaces
for electrical, fluid, propellant and gases must be minimized.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">A facility example is the need for a GOX vent
arm for Shuttle. Driven by a fragile vehicle (tile) and thus the
need to avoid ice an extra interface was created. A robust
vehicle thermal protection system and structure is desirable.
Metallic and zero waterproofing materials would be an avenue of
research, development and demonstration. Another alternative, a
vent all the way down to zero level would possibly integrate with
a T-0 umbilical but would not eliminate the interface. A GH2 vent
is another example. Free venting would, in effect, eliminate the
need for a vent arm. However, other functions would also have to
taken to zero level that otherwise would have been on a vent arm.
Proof of safety would be a highly desirable concept to develop
and demonstrate. (i.e. why SSTO has immediate benefits - less
interfaces such as for ET or SRB or to the ground).</font></p>

<hr>

<p><a name="CONSIDER"><font size="3"></font></a></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>OTHER CONSIDERATIONS</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">Other key characteristics to incorporate into a
next generation launch system include robustness, and reusability
(real, not partial). A thermal protection system such as Shuttle
is extremely manpower intensive (averages of 50,000 manhours per
orbiter flow). Waterproofing closes out (interferes with and
stops) other work as well due to the hazardous fluids used. A
robust, zero maintenance skin is a priority area for research,
development and demonstration.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Other factors, primarily business related
(profitability, payback, ROI, IRR, methods of design for cost,
business plans, investors, payload potentials and possible
markets) are beyond the scope of this compilation (for now). They
are key to defining a unique mission model against which to
evaluate diverse concepts (for an &quot;apples to apples&quot;
comparison). Shuttle, though a technological wonder with great
flexibility (people and payload transportation, payload
deployment, repair, retrieval, science, and so forth) does not
meet the expanded mission model of future systems - space
transportation, and affordability, supportability, commercial
viability, robustness and even higher reliability.</font></p>
