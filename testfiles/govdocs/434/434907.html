Officer Brian Hennessey ("Hennessey"), a technician and federal law

shortly responded with a "Response to the Action" form, indicating
that they could neither confirm nor refute that the EL CONQUISTADOR

the United States, and more specifically, exercise jurisdiction
over stateless vessels. 46 U.S.C. app. &sect; 1903(c).  In accordance

government debriefing in order to qualify for the safety-valve

December&#160;8, 2004.  The court granted them an immediate hearing to
determine their entitlement to the safety-valve benefit.  A DEA
special agent testified that, although Appellants' stories
coincided in certain aspects, it was abnormal that Appellants did
not know the details of how the drug transfer was going to take
place.  He explained that the scenario was "too risky" to be
believable; he had never investigated a case in which a drug
trafficker had placed unknown individuals against their wills on a
vessel loaded with contraband of such value without providing
information about the transfer, or without agreeing to any payment. 
The agent also noticed that, based on his experience and training,
Appellants appeared to easily answer "non-stressful" questions
about their families and Colombia, but that a level of stress or
deception was perceptible in Appellants' answers to questions
regarding the smuggling venture, the drugs, and payments.</span></span></p>

benefit, indicating that the consistency of Appellants' statements
did not overcome the gaps in the logic of their story.  The court
also denied their requests for a downward departure for duress. 
Again, the court indicated that it did not find Appellants' stories
to be totally truthful.  Both Appellants were then sentenced to the
statutory mandatory minimum term of 120 months of imprisonment.</span></span></p>

Bravo's request for a downward departure for duress, and sentenced

court erred in determining that it had jurisdiction over the

46 U.S.C. app. &sect; 1903(c)(1)(A).  Additionally, "a 'vessel without

refuting the vessel's registration in Colombia.  Since Colombia, as
the nation of alleged registry, could not confirm the vessel's

United States disregarded the recommendation of the Colombian
authorities to follow "international law" when apprehending the
vessel.  The USCG acted within both international treaty law and
customary international law.  The Agreement to Suppress Illicit
Traffic by Sea, ratified and brought into force by the United

apprehension of the vessel and its crew.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">See</span> Agreement Between the

possessed marijuana, and that they did so with the intent to
distribute it.  Moreover, the jury was instructed on the issues
that it had to determine, and instructed that jurisdiction over the

however, did not find that Appellants were acting under duress. 
Appellants Bravo and Mart&iacute;nez now claim that, because the court did
not rule on the applicability of a duress offense until after the
close of all evidence, they were denied the opportunity to choose
a defense strategy in advance and participate in a fair trial.</span></span></p>

employ a pre-trial hearing or to wait until after all evidence has
been heard at trial, to determine whether the evidence of duress is
sufficient as a matter of law to warrant an instruction. <span style="text-decoration: underline">See</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline">e.g.</span>,
<span style="text-decoration: underline">United States</span> v. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Bailey</span>, 444 U.S. 394, 399-401 (1980) (upholding
the convictions of four defendants, three of whom, at their joint
trial, were denied a duress instruction after the close of
evidence, and the fourth defendant who, at a separate trial, was
denied a duress instruction prior to trial).  Indeed, we are
unaware of any case mandating a pre-trial determination of the
sufficiency of the evidence for a duress defense.  Moreover, the
record indicates that Appellants were not prevented from arguing at
trial that Appellants were acting under duress, or from presenting
evidence to the jury, including the testimony of each Appellant,
allegedly demonstrating that they acted under duress.  Thus, the
district court did not err by denying Appellants a pre-trial
determination on their duress defense.</span></span></p>

offense is permitted for a defendant "who is less culpable than
most other participants, but whose role could not be described as
minimal."  U.S.S.G. &sect; 3B1.2(b), cmt., n.5.  Here, although the PSR
recommended that a two-level adjustment be granted, the government
objected to the recommendation, arguing that Appellants were
culpable to the same degree because they were all members of the
vessel's crew, equally advancing the same venture.  Appellants
argued that because none of them were the captain of the vessel,
but rather crew members, with less significant functions than the
captain, they held minor roles.  In denying the adjustment, the
sentencing court ruled that it could not differentiate the major
from the minor participants in the case.</span></span></p>

were the crew, it is not clear that the sentencing judge erred in
denying the adjustment.  Appellants failed to demonstrate that any

find that the record, taken as a whole, will not support a finding

Appellants was consistent, it was "illogical" and "incredible" that
an international drug smuggler would place $7.5 million of
narcotics on a vessel traveling in international waters without
having some type of voluntary control over the vessel's crew.  This
testimony is more than a statement of no confidence.  The testimony
of Special Agent Gonz&aacute;les, based on his years of experience in the
