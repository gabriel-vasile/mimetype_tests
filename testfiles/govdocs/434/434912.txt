                   ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL [1]
                                
                         I.  BACKGROUND

     On July 6, 2000, the Office of Acquisition and Grants of the
Social  Security  Administration issued the subject  solicitation
for   services  to  pick  up  and  prepare  first-class  national
distribution mail at its Southeastern Program Service  Center  in
Birmingham, Alabama.  The Contracting Officer (CO) designated the
procurement  as a total small business set-aside and assigned  to
it   Standard  Industrial  Classification  Code  7389,   Business
Services,  Not  Elsewhere  Classified, with  a  corresponding  $5
million average annual receipts size standard.

     On September 14, 2000, the CO notified unsuccessful offerors
that   the  apparent  successful  offeror  was  Dependable   Mail
Services,  Inc.  (Dependable).   On  September  20,  2000,   Dove
Mailing,  Inc.  (Appellant), the incumbent  contractor,  filed  a
protest with the CO "to challenge the small business size  status
of  the apparent successful offeror."  On September 25, 2000, the
CO   transmitted  Appellant's  protest  to  the  Small   Business
Administration  (SBA), Office of Government Contracting-Area  III
(Area  Office) in Atlanta, Georgia.  The CO's transmittal  letter
identified Dependable as the challenged firm.

     On September 26, 2000, the Area Office dismissed Appellant's
protest  as  insufficiently  specific.   Appellant  received  the
dismissal  that  same  day via facsimile transmission.   Also  on
September 26th, the CO awarded the procurement to Dependable.  On
October  6,  2000, Appellant, through counsel, filed the  instant
appeal.

      Appellant  asserts the Area Office erred in dismissing  its
protest  for  two  reasons.  First, though its  protest  did  not
identify the apparent successful offeror by name, it did  include
the  solicitation number, which was sufficient to  place  SBA  on
notice  of  the  identity  of  the apparent  successful  offeror.
Second,  though  Appellant  concedes  it  did  not  present   any
information   with  its  protest  supporting  its  challenge   to
Dependable's  size,  it  alleges that such  information  was  and
remains   readily  available.   In  support  of  its  allegation,
Appellant  attaches  to  its appeal, as new  evidence,  a  Dun  &
Bradstreet  report  stating Dependable's  annual  sales  are  $35
million.   Appellant argues that to dismiss its protest based  on
technicalities  will  result  in the  manifest  injustice  of  an
ineligible firm receiving the award.

                         II.  DISCUSSION
     
     Appellant  filed  the  instant  appeal  within  15  days  of
receiving the Area Office's dismissal of its protest.   Thus,  it
is  timely.  See 13 C.F.R. Section 134.304(a)(1); see  also  Size
Appeal of MBI Corporation, SBA No. SIZ-4375, at 5 n.8 (1999).

     As  a  threshold  matter, the Administrative Judge  EXCLUDES
from  consideration  Appellant's  proffered  new  evidence.   The
Administrative Judge will not consider evidence Appellant  failed
to present to the Area Office unless he orders it presented or  a
motion  is  served  and filed establishing  good  cause  for  the
submission;  neither event occurred here.  See 13 C.F.R.  Section
134.308(a);   Size   Appeal  of  Premiere  Building   Maintenance
Corporation,  SBA No. SIZ-4358, at 2 (1999).  Further,  Appellant
cannot  "cure"  a  nonspecific protest on  appeal  by  submitting
information it did not present to the Area Office.  See Premiere,
SBA No. SIZ-4358, at 2.

     The  Administrative  Judge concludes he  must  dismiss  this
appeal.   While  Appellant is correct in its assertion  that  its
protest, together with the CO's transmittal letter, put the  Area
Office  on  notice of the identity of the challenged  firm,  this
alone  is  insufficient  to support  its  appeal.   A  review  of
Appellant's protest reveals it articulated no basis whatever  for
the  allegation  that Dependable is other  than  small.   A  size
protest  must provide some evidentiary basis for its allegations.
A  mere  assertion  a firm is other than small provides  no  such
basis.   See  13  C.F.R.  Section  121.1007(b);  Size  Appeal  of
Dawkins/CSI  Construction  Co., SBA No.  SIZ-4321,  at  2  (1998)
(citing  Size  Appeal of CardioMetrix, SBA  No.  SIZ-4226,  at  3
(1996)).
     
     Further, the fact that information on Dependable's size  was
available  does not compel SBA to seek it out.  Rather, Appellant
had  the  burden  of  producing the information  to  support  its
protest.   Id.   Appellant is really challenging,  not  the  Area
Office's  dismissal, but the regulatory scheme, which requires  a
protester  to  provide  a  specific  evidentiary  basis  for  its
allegations.  This Office cannot entertain such a challenge.  See
Size Appeal of Valenzuela Engineering, Inc., SBA No. SIZ-4151, at
7 (1996).
     
     Finally,  even  if  Appellant's protest were  specific,  the
Administrative  Judge would have to dismiss the appeal  as  moot.
Appellant   seeks  to  appeal  a  favorable  size   determination
regarding  another offeror after contract award.   This  Office's
precedent  requires  the Administrative  Judge  to  dismiss  such
appeals  as  moot.  See, e.g. Size Appeal of Technical  Ordnance,
Inc., SBA No. SIZ-4414, at 3 (2000).


                         III. CONCLUSION

      For the above reasons, the Administrative Judge AFFIRMS the
Area Office's dismissal of Appellant's protest and DISMISSES  the
instant appeal.

      This is the Small Business Administration's final decision.
See 13 C.F.R. Section 134.316(b).
