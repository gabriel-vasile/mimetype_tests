tribe, the Osages were not very dependable at the best of times and now that they saw confusion all around
Indians in Kansas till such time as they can be treated with. And such order to the Commander of the Western Division of the U.S. Army would stop further proceedings.
I shall start to-morrow for Council Grove and meet the Kansas Indians before General Mitchell's force can get there. As the point of attack is secret, I fear it may be the Osages, for the purpose of creating a necessity for a treaty with himself by which he can secure a large quantity of land for himself and followers. He is acquainted with all the old Democratic schemes of swindling Indians.
The necessity for prompt action on the part of the Indian Department increases every day. The element of discord in the community here now, was once, the pro-slavery parry. I see their intention to breed disturbances with the Indians is malicious and selfish. They are active and unscrupulous, and must be met promptly and decisively.
I hope you will excuse this, as it appears necessary for me to step a little out of my orders to notify you of current events. I am very respectfully Your Ob4 Ser74               Augustus Wattles, Special Agent

Com. Indian Affairs
Washington, D. C.
Hon. Sir: Permit me to inform you, by this means, of the efforts .that have been and are now being made in Southern Kansas to arouse both the "Osages" and "Cherokees" to rebel, and bear arms against the U.S. Government- At a public meeting near the South E. corner of the "Osage Nation" called by the settlements for the devising of some means by which to protect themselves from "unlawful characters," Mr. John Mathis, who resides in the Osage Nation and has an Osage family, also Mr. "Robert Foster" who lives in the Cherokee Nation and has a Cherokee family endeavered by public speeches and otherwise to induce "Osages", "Cherokees", as well as Americans who live on the "Neutral Lands" to bear arms against the U.S. Government -aledging that there <was no U.S. Government. There was 25 men who joined them and they proceeded to organise a "Secession Company" electing as Capt R. D. Foster and 1st Lieutenant James Patton- This meeting was held June 4th 1861-at "McGhees Residence"- The peace of this section of country requires the removal of these men from the Indian country, or some measures that will restrain them from exciting the Indians in Southern Kansas.
Yours Respectfully                                                            Wm. Brooks.
You will understand why you are addressed by a private individual
on this subject instead of the Agent,  since A. J. Dorn,  the  present
Indian Agent,  is  an  avowed  "Secessionist"  and  consequently would
favor, rather than suppress the move.                                Wm. Brooks.
