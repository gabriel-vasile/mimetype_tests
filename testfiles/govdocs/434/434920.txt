QUESTION:
Before you have any humans living on Mars, would you test things by
having animals live on it first? 

ANSWER from Cheick Diarra on December 20, 1996:
Sending a living being to Mars is so complex and the technologies are 
so dependable now I think that after we learn what we need to know to 
send a human to Mars, we will not go through the step of sending 
animals there.
