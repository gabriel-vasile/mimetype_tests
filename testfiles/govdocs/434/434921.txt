I would certainly like to have the option to know if a manager has an 
investment in the fund that she/he is managing. The most obvious reason - 
self-interest is a dependable force. 
     
My hard-earned money (for old age) is on the line. Why shouldn't I have all 
the information possible in making a decision about with who and where to 
invest it - in this matter and any others that are pertinent?
     
Thank you.
