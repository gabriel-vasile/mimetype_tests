To Whom It May Concern:

Have you ever heard the expression "If it's not broken, don't fix it"?  
When GPS first came out, it was not nearly as dependable as it is now.  
Please leave it alone, because there will be lives loss, while you work 
to get the "bug worked out of the new system."

Please feel free to contact me for more input.

Thank you for your time.
