Service Contractor
Service kits will be sent to exhibitors from Freeman upon the NFIP Bureau’s receipt of exhibitor’s completed 
application for space, registration form, and full payment. Service kits will include all necessary forms for 
shipping, ordering booth furnishings, display labor, signs, rental exhibits, and electrical, telephone, audiovisual, 
and computer equipment.

Shipping
The Hyatt is unable to store your display materials prior to your show dates FREEMAN must handle all 
exhibitor materials. This ensures a smooth set-up and dismantling of exhibits.  Collect shipments will not be 
accepted. Shipments will be received 30 days prior to show move-in, but not before. Complete information and 
rates will be included in the exhibitor service kit.
Security
During non-posted hours, the Exhibit Hall will be closed.  Any other protection for your display and/or 
equipment will be your own responsibility. You will also be responsible for your own security during the official 
posted exhibition hours.

space.

3. SPACE ASSIGNMENTS/FLOOR PLAN: THE NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM BUREAU AND STATISTICAL AGENT (referred to as 
NFIP/CSC) shall use its best efforts to locate the booth(s) in one of the locations designated by the exhibitor on the application and to provide physical 
separation of the booth from the booths of those competitors from whom the exhibitor has requested such separation. Notwithstanding the above, 
NFIP/CSC reserves the right to change location assignments at any time, as it may in its sole discretion deem necessary. All exhibit space is on the 
floorplan which and is available to all exhibitors. The dimensions of the exhibit booths are believed to be accurate but only warranted to be approximate.

4. ASSIGNMENT AND SUBLEASE: The exhibitor shall not sub-let the booth or any equipment provided by NFIP/CSC, nor shall the exhibitor assign this 
lease in whole or in part without written notice to and approval from NFIP/CSC.

regular jurisdiction of the NFIP/CSC.

6. POSITIONS OF EQUIPMENT WITH RELATION TO AISLE: Machines or equipment operated or demonstrated at any time during show hours shall be 
so placed that no portion is closer than 12” to an aisle unless prior permission is obtained. Exhibitors must agree to display their exhibits so as not to 
obstruct the general view or hide other exhibits.

7. NOISE: Public address, sound producing, or amplifying devices which project sound beyond the exhibitor’s booth, or excessive operating noise that 
distract neighboring exhibits, are expressly prohibited. NFIP/CSC reserves the right to restrict exhibits which, because of noise or for any other reason, 
become objectionable or which may detract from the general character of the exhibit.

8. EXCLUSION: NFIP/CSC reserves the right to exclude or to require modification of any display or demonstration which, in its sole discretion, it 
considers unsuitable or not in keeping with the character of the EXPO.  NFIP/CSC shall have the right to prohibit the use of amplifying equipment or

persons or mannequins. This clause includes, but is not limited to, printed material, equipment, signs, objects of art or costumes and/or abbreviated 
clothing worn by booth personnel.

9. INSTALLATION AND DISMANTLING: Exhibit space will be available for installation by the exhibitors at a date and time to be made known in 
advance. Exhibits cannot be dismantled before the conclusion of the exhibition. It is the duty and responsibility of each exhibitor to have his/her exhibit 
completely installed in his/her booth area before the opening of the exhibition and to dismantle and remove his/her exhibit after the close of the 
exhibition.  Union jurisdiction prevails over any installation of exhibits or displays, which requires the use of tools or ladders.

10. LIABILITY AND INSURANCE: The exhibitor agrees to protect, save, and NFIP/CSC, harmless for any damages or charges imposed for the 
violations of any law or ordinance, whether occasioned by the negligence of the exhibitor or those holding under the exhibitor, as well as to strictly 
comply with applicable terms and conditions in the agreement with the Hyatt and NFIP/CSC regarding the exhibition premises. Exhibitor shall at all times 
protect, indemnify, save, and hold harmless NFIP/CSC against and from any and all losses, costs (including attorney fees), damages, liability, or 
expense arising from or out of or by reason of any accident or bodily injury or other occurrence to any person or persons, including the exhibitor, its 
agents, employees, and business invitees, which arises from or out of the use of the exhibition premises or part thereof.

NFIP/CSC cannot assume responsibility for the safety of property of the exhibitor, its officers, agents, or employees from theft, damage by fire, accident, 
or other causes, but will use all reasonable care to protect them against such loss. In all cases, exhibitors wishing to insure their property must do so at 
their own expense. It is especially recommended that all exhibitors have a representative in attendance at all times when the exhibits are being set up or 
dismantled, to protect them from loss.

11. FLOOR LOAD: An exhibitor who plans to show heavy equipment must position it on suitable wood or steel support of sufficient size to properly 
distribute the weight over a required area, such supports to be approved. In all such cases, the exhibitor should present complete information to the 
official service contractor sufficiently in advance to enable engineering analysis. 

12. PROTECTION OF BUILDING: Nothing should be posted on, tacked, nailed or screwed, or otherwise attached to columns, walls, floors or other parts 
of the building or furniture. Whatever is necessary to properly protect the building, equipment, or furniture will be at the expense of the exhibitors. 
Exhibitors are liable for any damage they cause to the exhibit hall property. Machinery in operation: Drip pans and scrape buckets should be provided to 
keep lubricants, excess material, etc. from staining the floor.

13. FIRE, SAFETY AND HEALTH: The exhibitor assumes all responsibility for compliance with local, city, and state ordinances and regulations covering 
fire, safety, and health. All exhibit equipment and materials will be reasonably located within the booth and protected by safety guards and devices 
where necessary. Only fireproof materials should be used in displays and the exhibitor will take the necessary fire precautions.

14. SAFETY GUARDS AND PROTECTION: Convention guests must be properly protected from injury. Any piece of machinery on display that has 
movable parts must have adequate safeguards to protect the public from injury throughout the exhibit period.

15. REGISTRATION OF VISITORS: NFIP/CSC shall have sole control over admission policies at all times. All persons visiting the convention session 
rooms and the exhibit area as well as exhibitor personnel shall be required to register and wear an appropriate badge while in attendance.

16. OFFICIAL SERVICE CONTRACTOR: To assure orderly and efficient installation, operation and removal of the displays, and to minimize confusion 
by the presence of solicitation of unknown or unqualified firms, FREEMAN has been designated an official service contractor. As such, FREEMAN holds 
this firm responsible for quality service, fair prices, and is prepared to intercede on behalf of an exhibitor in the event of faulty work or unfair charges. 
However, you are free to use your own display house. If you are planning to use an outside contractor to set and dismantle your exhibit, they must 
submit their request, in writing, to FREEMAN and list the names of all display company representatives working in the exhibit area along with proof of 
liability insurance. The Show Decorator has the responsibility of receiving and handling all exhibit materials and empty crates. It is their responsibility to 
manage loading docks and schedule vehicles for the smooth and efficient move-in and move-out of the exposition.

17. OTHER SERVICE CONTRACTORS: Exhibitors who plan to have an exhibit service firm (other than the official labor contractor) unpack, erect, 
assemble, dismantle, and pack displays/equipment must abide by the following rules: (A) Notify FREEMAN by March 21, 2008; (B) The service firm 
must notify FREEMAN by March 21, 2008 of the names of all exhibiting companies for whom they have orders, the names of all employees working on 
the show, and furnish insurance certificates appropriate to requirements of FREEMAN; (C) Upon arrival at the exposition site, service companies must 
check in with FREEMAN to receive permits to work on the exposition floor and; (D) Appropriate forms in the service manual must be completed and 
submitted with proof of insurance to the official service contractor 30 days prior to the show.

18. NON-EXHIBITORS: Persons connected with non-exhibiting concerns are prohibited from any dealing, exhibiting, or soliciting within the exhibit area. 
Exhibitors are urged to immediately report violations of this rule to FREEMAN.

19. AMENDMENT TO RULES: Any and all matters or questions not specifically covered by the preceding Rules and Regulations shall be subject solely 
to the decision of NFIP/CSC and FREEMAN. NFIP/CSC or FREEMAN may amend these Rules and Regulations, at any time, and all amendments so 
made shall be binding on the exhibitors equally with the foregoing Rules and Regulations.

20. FAILURE TO HOLD SHOW: Should any contingency prevent holding of the show, NFIP/CSC and FREEMAN may retain such part of the exhibit 
rental as shall be required to recompense for expenses incurred up to the time contingency shall have occurred. The exhibitor waives all claims for 
damages or recovery of payments made except the return of the pro-rated amount paid for exhibit space less expenses incurred by FREEMAN.
