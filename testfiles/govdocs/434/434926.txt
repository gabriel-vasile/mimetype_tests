HAVE UPDATED FL ZONES TO LOWER MIN TEMPERATURES AS DEWPOINTS HAVE               
DROPPED INTO THE LOW TEENS. THE PENN STATE SHORT RANGE ENSEMBLE                 
STATISTICS SHOW HEIGHTS/THICKNESSES/TEMPERATURES AROUND 4 STANDARD              
DEVIATIONS BELOW NORMAL DIRECTLY OVER OUR CWFA. THIS HIGHLIGHTS THE             
EXTREMITY OF THIS EVENT AND SUGGESTS GUIDANCE TEMPERATURES MAY NOT              
BE DEPENDABLE. WINDS ALREADY BECOMING LIGHTER OVER WRN ZONES...BUT              
WILL KEEP WIND CHILL ADVISORY IN EFFECT FOR THE TIME BEING.

WE PLAN TO EXPAND THE WIND CHILL ADVISORY INTO OUR AL AND GA ZONES.             
00Z UPPER DATA SHOW STRONG LOW-LEVEL CAA WITH -18C AT 850MB UPSTREAM            
AT BHM. THIS SUGGESTS THAT SURFACE WINDS MAY STAY SUFFICIENTLY                  
STRONG OVER NEXT SEVERAL HOURS TO DROP WIND CHILLS BELOW ZERO OVER OUR          
AL/GA ZONES. 23Z RUC PROGS A SURFACE HIGH TO BECOME CENTERED JUST W             
OF OUR CWA BY 12Z WITH A LOOSER PRESSURE GRADIENT...SO WE EXPECT

IR SATELLITE SHOWS LOW CLOUDS GRADUALLY ERODING OVER LAND WITH LOSS

INDICATED SECOND SURGE OF COLD AIR NOW ALMOST THRU THE FORECAST

MEASURABLE REMAINDER OF TONIGHT. RUC AND MESO-ETA MODEL INDICATE THE            
SCT-BKN LOW CLOUDS SHOULD BE DISSIPATING THRU 12Z WED. THIS IS                  
REASONABLE BASED ON RAPID MOVEMENT OF UPPER LEVEL TROUGH TOWARD THE

     PAVES THE WAY FOR SEVERAL INCREASINGLY STRONG CFPS THIS WKND AND           
     EARLY NEXT WEEK THEN A VERY COLD OUTBREAK (XPCTG ABOUT 15F BLO

    IN MRF FOR MAX TEMPS IN "BOSTON" NO HIGHER THAN 20F BY MIDDLE OF            
    NEXT WEEK...IE 12/27-29 TIME FRAME. I DO BELIEVE THIS WILL                  
    COME TO PASS FOR AT LEAST 2 DAYS...ESPECIALLY IF LEFTOVR

EXPECTED. LAKE BAND JUST NOW ENTERING LEELANAU COUNTY WILL CONTINUE

SNOW OVR THE CENTRAL THIRD. WITH 3 TO 4 INCHES DOWN THAT PUTS US                
INTO WARNING CRITERIA. IN ORDER TO AVOID THIS PROBLEM FOR A TYPICAL             
PENNSYLVANIA SNOWFALL WE WILL SAY AROUND 5 INCHES...RATHER THAN                 
GIVING A RANGE WHICH WOULD REQUIRE A WARNING.                                   
THE NEW ETA IS SHOWING THE DEFORMATION BAND STAYING OVR THE MIDDLE              
THIRD OF THE STATE THRU 00Z. THERE IS STILL A REFLECTION OF THE LOW             
OVR S VA AT 00Z. THIS WILL ALLOW THE FRONTOGENESIS TO CONT UNTIL                
THAT TIME. BETWEEN 0 AND 6Z THE LOW FALLS APART AND THE STORM CENTER            
OFF SHORE TAKES OVER. THIS WILL WIPE OUT THE FRONTOGENESIS OVR PA               
AND THE SNOW WILL JUST TAPER TO FLURRIES. THERE PROB WILL NOT BE A              
DEFINITIVE MOVEMENT FROM W TO E AS IT ENDS...IT WILL JUST DSPT.                 
THE NEXT FEW DAYS WILL FEATURE A COLD NW FLOW GRAD BACKING INTO THE

MADE SOME CHANGES TO THE FORECAST DUE TO THE NEW MDLS...ETA AND RUC.            
BELIEVE THAT ANY CHANCE OF SNOW THROUGH THE REST OF THE NIGHT IS OVER           
...EXCEPT FOR SOME FLURRIES IN THE ATY/SIS AREA THROUGH MIDNIGHT.               
OTHERWISE...MDLS SHOW DRYING AND SUBSIDENCE MOVING IN THROUGH THE               
REST OF THE NIGHT. THEREFORE...SKIES SHOULD GO P/C ACROSS THE CWA.              
LL RH INCREASES LATE AND THERE MAY BE SOME LOW CLOUDS MOVING IN

COASTAL STORM APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK FOR PASSING JUST BARELY TO THE

12Z ETA LOOKS TO HAVE DONE THE BEST JOB WITH THE POSN OF THE COASTAL            
LOW AT 00Z (IT WAS A TAD TOO DEEP WITH IT THOUGH). 12Z ETA WAS ALSO A           
TAD TOO DEEP WITH THE SFC LOW ACRS THE ERN GREAT LKS REGION AT 00Z.             
COASTAL STORM TO TRACK ACRS THE GULF OF ME AND UP INTO THE CANADIAN             
MARITIMES ON WED. CYCLONIC SFC FLOW TO PERSIST ACRS THE FA ON WED. WK

OVRNITE TONITE. SFC TEMPS TO GET DOWN INTO THE MID TEENS (ST LAW VLY)           
TO THE U20S. T1MIN TEMPS ARE 15-25 DEG F. MESONET OBS SHOW THAT                 
READINGS ARE BASICALLY ALREADY AT THESE VALUES. NOT EXPECTING MUCH              
MORE COOLING AT THE SFC OVRNITE...SO WILL JUST WIDEN UP MOST LOW TEMP           
FORECASTS FOR THE OVRNITE PERIOD. SFC FLOW TO BECOME NORTHERLY AT               
AROUND 5 KTS TONITE. BEST LOW-LVL (AND MID-LVL) MOISTURE TO BE                  
LOCATED ACRS VT TONITE (LEAST ACRS NRN NY STATE). BEST LOW-LVL                  
MOISTURE ADVECTION AND H85 THETA-E ADVECTION TO TAKE PLACE TO THE               
EAST AND SOUTH OF THE FA TONITE. PW VALUES OVRNITE APPEAR TO MAX OUT

TONITE. RUC SHOWS 0.1-0.4" OF QPF THRU 09Z TONITE (BEST ACRS ERN/SRN            
VT). SNOWFALL RATIOS HERE AT BTV SO FAR HAVE BEEN ABOUT 25-TO-1.                
STILL NOT EXPECTING A STRAIGHT 10-TO-1 RATIO FOR THE REST OF THE                
EVENT. 21Z RUC BASICALLY LOOKS VERY SIMILAR TO THE 12Z ETA FROM MY              
PERSPECTIVE.                                                                    
HPC MANUAL QPF GRAPHICS SHOW LESS THAN 0.6" OF QPF ACRS THE FA THRU             
18Z WED (AVG VALUES APPEAR TO BE ABOUT 0.25"). 12Z ETA SHOWS BETWEEN            
0.1" AND LESS THAN 0.85" OF QPF FOR THE SAME TIME PERIOD. AS WAS                
THOUGHT YESTERDAY...THESE UPR LIMITS MAY NOT VERIFY...BUT WITH HIGH             
SNOWFALL RATIOS STILL EXPECTING ANYWHERE FROM 2" TO AS MUCH 8" OR SO            
ACRS THE FA THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE EVENT. LEAST AMTS WILL FALL ACRS

H85 WAA TO TAKE PLACE ACRS THE FA EARLY TONITE...THEN CAA LATER                 
TONITE (STRENGTHENING WITH TIME ON WED). SOME AMT OF LOW-LVL MOISTURE           
TO LINGER ACRS THE FA ON WED AS MID-LVLS DRY OUT. PCPN TAPERING OFF             
TO -SHSN STILL LOOKS GOOD FOR WED (ESPECIALLY IN THE MTNS).                     
FEW TWEAKS TO FIRST PERIOD WINDS BASED ON CURRENT OBS TRENDS AND RUC            
DATA. DROPPED POPS (TO LIKELY) AND SNOWFALL AMTS ACRS ST LAW CTY                
SINCE 88D MOSAIC/BUFCAN DATA INDICATES THAT THE PCPN APPEARS TO HAVE            
SUBSIDED IN THAT NECK OF THE WOODS. SOME MORE PCPN STILL POSSIBLE               
WITH UPR TROF PASSAGE THERE. BEST MOISTURE PLUME IN H2O VAP IMAGERY             
APPEARS TO HAVE PASSED THE FA BY AS OF LATE...BUT STORM SYS STILL HAS

REASON TO KEEP MIXED PRECIPITATION FROM THE INTERSTATE 20 CORRIDOR -

2-3 INCH SNOWFALL IN AREAS NOT RECEIVING A LAKE CONTRIBUTION.
