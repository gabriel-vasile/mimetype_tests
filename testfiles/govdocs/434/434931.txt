       STATEMENT

1. In July 1992, Rockford Corporation (Rockford)
began a pipeline construction project in Longview,
Washington. A labor contract between Rockford and
the United Association of Plumbers and Pipe Fitters
(United Association) required the United Association
to supply Rockford with seven of 13 "rig welders,"
whom Rockford needed to carry out the project. The
United Association, in turn, selected petitioner, Lo-
cal Union No. 32 of the United Association (Union),
to operate a hiring hall in order to find qualified rig
welders and to refer them to Rockford. Pet. App. 3-4.
Although the Union maintained hiring hall lists for
jobs in the construction and maritime industries, it
did not maintain a referral list for pipeline welders.
Moreover, business agent Donald Galloway, the
Union official responsible for staffing the Rockford
job, was unfamiliar with pipeline work, and the Union
had not performed any pipeline work within its ju-
risdiction since 1990. Pet. App. 5, 41. Accordingly,
Galloway asked Jeff Manning, who had been selected
by the Union to serve as steward on the Rockford job,
to compile a list of individuals whom Manning knew
to be dependable and qualified rig welders. Galloway
also gathered the names of rig welders who had
worked on a project staffed by the Union in 1990, and
the names of individuals recommended by the busi-
ness managers of other United Association locals. Id.
at 5, 41-42. Galloway dispatched rig welders to the
Rockford jobsite from this pool of applicants, as they

---------------------------------------- Page Break ----------------------------------------                    

3

were needed. Id. at 5, 42. However, the Union did not
establish any rules governing the operation of its
hiring hall: the Union did not maintain any written
list of applicants for rig welding work, did not dis-
patch individuals to the Rockford jobsite in order of
application, and did not rank the applicants in any
manner. Id. at 6,41,4243.
On July 3, 1992, William Harper and Michael
Flowers, experienced rig welders who were members
of a United Association local in Bakersfield, Califor-
nia, sought work at the Rockford job site. Pet. App. 7,
43. Union steward Manning told Harper and Flow-
ers that he was gathering names for Al Sexton, the
Union's business manager, and that Sexton would call
them. Id. at 7, 43-44. Manning, however, failed his
welding test the same day and did no further work
on the Rockford project. Two days later, "on July 5,
Harper and Flowers attempted, unsuccessfully, to
speak with Sexton at the Union's office in Seattle;
however, they did meet with Tim Elwell, a Union
business agent responsible for plumbing, not pipe-
fitting, work. Id. at 7, 44. Elwell explained that Sex-
ton and Galloway handled pipeline work referrals and,
when pressed by Harper and Flowers, accepted their
travel cards, and allowed them to sign what they be-
lieved was an out-of-work list for pipeline welders. Id.
at 7,44-45.
Five days later, on July 10, 1992, after receiving no
response from Sexton and learning that additional
welders were taking the welding test, .Harper and
Flowers went again to the Rockford jobsite. Phil
Stroud, the new Union steward, asked them to be
patient, promising to allow them to take the welding
test. Pet. App. 8. Harper and Flowers returned later
that day, after two individuals failed the welding test.

---------------------------------------- Page Break ----------------------------------------

Flowers again asked Stroud whether he and Harper
could "get on the job." Stroud responded by refer-
ring them to Rockford's foreman, who (according to
Harper and Flowers) told them that he did not need
additional welders. Id. at 8-9, 46. Harper and Flowers
remained in the Longview area for several days,
waiting, to no avail, for the Union to contact them.
Discouraged by their inability to obtain a referral to
the Rockford job from the Union, they returned to
California. On July 22, Flowers called Galloway, who
reported that all the welding jobs on the Rockford
project had been filled. Id.  at 9, 46.
2. Harper and Flowers filed unfair labor practice
charges against the Union.  On October 7, 1992,
the General Counsel of the National Labor Rela-
tions Board (Board) issued a consolidated complaint,
alleging that the Union breached its duty of
fair representation, and violated Section 8(b)(1)(A)
of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), 29
U.S.C. 158(b)(l)(A), by arbitrarily refusing to dis-
patch Harper, Flowers, and other qualified applicants
from its hiring hall to jobs on the Rockford project.
Pet. App. 37,47.
a. After a hearing, the administrative law judge
(ALJ) concluded that the Union violated Section
8(b)(1)(A) in the operation of its exclusive hiring hail,
by failing to use objective criteria and standards
in referring applicants to the Rockford jobsite for
employment as rig welders. Pet. App. 56. 1.  The ALJ

___________________(footnotes)

1. Initially, the ALJ noted that, although under the terms
of the labor contract between Rockford and the United Associa-
tion "[Rockford] chose 6 employees, leaving the Union with the
task of referring 7 employ ees,] * * * the Union operated an
exclusive hiring hall notwithstanding that [Rockford] had the
right to choose half the employees." Pet. App. 49 n. 1. In the

---------------------------------------- Page Break ----------------------------------------

     5

explained that "Galloway testified that he was not
familiar with pipeline work and that he referred
employees based on the recommendations of Manning
and some business managers from other locals." Id.
at 50. However, other than making one referral on
the basis of a recommendation supplied by the ap-
plicant's uncle, the ALJ found that Galloway "could
not explain how the employees were selected from the
pool of recommended employees." Ibid. Similarly, the
ALJ observed that "Manning admitted that he gave
recommendations to Galloway but denied any knowl-
edge as to how the employees were chosen.?' Id. at 50-
51. Further, the ALJ noted that neither Galloway nor
Manning could explain how applicants were selected
for referral to job openings which were created when
some employees failed the welding test. Id. at 51.
Accordingly, the ALJ concluded that the Union's
operation of its exclusive hiring hall violated Section
8(b)(l)(A) because "it is * * * impossible to find any
objective criteria or standards for choosing among
the qualified applicants." Id. at 51-52, Rather, the
ALJ explained that, "[w]hile the record shows that
Manning and Galloway attempted to refer only qual-
ified and dependable welders, at "best a subjective
test was used," with the result that "[qualified
welders such as Harper and Flowers could not be con-
sidered because they were unknown to Galloway and
Manning." Id. at 51.
The ALJ also concluded that the Union violated
Section 8(b)(2) of the NLRA, 29 U.S.C. 158(b)(2), by

___________________(footnotes)                                             
                                              
court of appeals, the Union did not challenge the Board's de-
termination that it operated an exclusive hiring hall with
respect to the Rockford project, and it does not contest the
Board's ruling in this Court.

discriminating against Harper, Flowers, and other
rig welders seeking job referrals, for reasons not
based on objective criteria and standards, thereby
causing Rockford to refuse to hire them. Pet. App.
56-57. 2. The ALJ explained that, by making job
referrals on the basis of a "subjective test," the
Union "discriminate[d] in favor of associates of Gallo-
way and Manning" (id. at 51), for "[employees un-
known to Manning, such as Harper and Flowers,
would be excluded" from the pool of applicants eligible
for dispatch to rig welding jobs "no matter how
qualified" (id. at 53-54).
To remedy its unfair labor practices, the ALJ or-
dered the Union, among other things, to cease and
desist from failing to use "objective, consistent cri-
teria and standards" in referring applicants to the
Rockford project or to jobs with "any other employer
with whom [the Union] maintains an exclusive job-
referral system for pipeline welders," and to make
Harper and Flowers whole for any losses they may
have suffered by reason of the Union's discriminatory
refusal to dispatch them to jobs on the Rockford
project. Pet. App. 60-61.
b. The Board affirmed the ALJ's findings and con-
clusions, and adopted his remedial order. Pet. App. 33-
35. 3. The court of appeals enforced the Board's order.
Pet. App. 1-31. The court explained that "a union
commits an unfair labor practice if it administers

2. The ALJ noted that, "[although the complaint only
alleges a violation of Section 8(b)(l){A), the issue of a refusal to
refer Harper and Flowers was alleged in the complaint," and,
moreover, "the refusal to refer the welders was fairly and fully
litigated." Pet. App. 55 n.2.

         7

the exclusive hall arbitrarily or without reference
to objective criteria and thereby affects the employ-
ment status of those it is expected to represent." Id.
at 16 (quoting Boilermakers Local No. 374 v. NLRB,
852 F.2d 1353, 1358 (D.C. Cir. 1988)). Applying that
principle, the court held that substantial evidence
supported the Board's finding that the Union operated
its hiring hall in violation of the NLRA. Pet.  App.
24. The court found that "[t]he ALJ's conclusion that
the applicant pool was closed to anyone unknown
to [Union] officials is confirmed by Galloway's own
testimony," and that "[t]he barriers to unknown ap-
plicants are further illustrated by the run-around
that Harper and Flowers encountered." Id. at 24-25.
The court agreed with the ALJ that " `at best a
subjective test was used' that `discriminate[d] in favor
of associates of Galloway and Manning.'" Id. at 27-28.
"The union's actions," the court observed, "plainly
violated its fiduciary duty to treat applicants `even-
handedly,' to inform all potential applicants of rele-
vant hiring hall rules, and to allow qualified individu-
als to register for work." Id. at 26.
In sustaining the Board's order, the court rejected
the Union's contention that, because "a breach of the
duty of fair representation does not amount to an
unfair labor practice,] * * * the Board lacked
jurisdiction in this case." Pet. App. 11. The court
explained that it had long held "that a breach of the
duty of fair representation can constitute an unfair
labor practice within the jurisdiction of the Board."
Id. at 12. The court also rejected the Union's con-
tention that, "[b]ecause the Board's General Counsel
alleged a violation of the duty of fair representation,
*** the ALJ should have applied the `highly
deferential' interpretation of the `arbitrary' com-

ponent of that duty" set forth in Air Line Pilots
Ass'n v. O'Neill, 499 U.S. 65 (1991). Pet. App. 17-18.
The court explained that "[a]t issue in O'Neill was
a duty of fair representation challenge to the sub-
stantive provisions of a strike settlement," and that,
"[attentive to the special role of the union as
negotiator, the Court required that `[a]ny substan-
tive examination of a union's performance * * *
must be highly deferential, recognizing the wide
latitude that negotiators need for the effective
performance of their bargaining responsibilities.'"
Id. at .20, 21 (quoting O'Neill, 499 U.S. at 78). By
contrast, the court explained, "[t]his case does not
involve a negotiated agreement"; rather, "[a]t issue
here is the operation of a hiring hall, where the union
has assumed the role of employer, as well as rep-
resentative, and where the risk of judicial second-
guessing of a negotiated agreement * * * is simply
not present." Pet. App. 22.

       ARGUMENT

1.   In Local 357, Int'1 Brotherhood of Teamsters v.
NLRB, 365 U.S. 667, 674-677 (1961), this Court held
that the use of a union hiring hall as the exclusive
source of job referrals. does not constitute dis-
crimination within the meaning of the NLRA, pro-
vided that the hiring hall is open to both members and
nonmembers and that there is no showing of dis-
crimination against nonmembers. The operator of an
exclusive hiring hall, however, owes a duty of fair
representation to the users of the hall, and that duty
includes an obligation to operate the hall in a man-
ner that is "nonarbitrary and nondiscriminatory."
Breininger v. Sheet. Metal Workers Int'1 Ass'n Local
Union No. 6, 493 U.S. 67,88 (1989). As the Board has

---------------------------------------- Page Break ----------------------------------------                    

9

explained, "a labor organization must conform with
and apply lawful contractual standards in the opera-
tion of the [hiring] hall and any departure from such
standards which results in a denial of employment to
an applicant for referral" constitutes the kind of "un-
fair, irrelevant, or invidious" treatment that violates
the union's duty of fair representation, absent a show-
ing that "the action was necessary for the effective
performance of- [the union's] function of representing
its constituency." International Union of Operating
Engineers Local 406, 262 N.L.R.B. 50, 57 (1982), en-
forced, 701 F.2d 504 (5th Cir. 1983).
Consistent with those principles, the Board rea-
sonably found that the Union operated its exclusive
hiring hall in an unlawful manner. Pet. App. 56-57.
As the ALJ observed, "it is * * * impossible to
find any objective criteria or standards for choosing
among the qualified applicants" for job openings on
the Rockford project (id. at 51-52); rather, "[w]hile
the record shows that Manning and Galloway at-
tempted to refer only qualified and dependable
welders, at best a subjective test was used," with
the result that "[q]ualified welders such as Harper
and Flowers could not be considered because they
were unknown to Galloway and Manning" (id. at 51).
Similarly, the ALJ found, by operating its hiring. hall
as it did, the Union "discriminate[d] in favor of
associates of Galloway and Manning" (ibid.), and
"[employees unknown to Manning, such as Harper
and Flowers, would be excluded" from the pool of
applicants eligible for dispatches "no matter how
qualified" (id. at 53-54). The court of appeals sus-
tained the Board's findings as supported by sub-
stantial evidence. Id. at 24. The court's fact-bound

---------------------------------------- Page Break ----------------------------------------

10

holding raises no issue warranting further review by
this Court, Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, 340
us. 474,490491 (1951).
2. Petitioner contends that the decision of the
court of appeals conflicts with this Court's decision in
Air Line Pilots Ass'n v. O'Neill, 499 U.S. 65 (1991).
Pet. 9. Petitioner's contention is mistaken.
As the court of appeals explained (Pet. App. 20),
"[a]t issue in O'Neill was a duty of fair representation
challenge to the substantive provisions of a strike
settlement," not a challenge to the union's operation
of an exclusive hiring hall. Because "Congress did
not intend judicial review of a union's performance to
permit the court to substitute its own view of the
proper bargain for that reached by the union," the
O `Neill Court concluded that "[a]ny substantive ex-
amination of a union's performance, therefore, must
be highly deferential, recognizing the wide latitude
that negotiators need for the effective performance
of their bargaining responsibilities." 499 U.S. at 78
(emphasis added). In that context, the Court held that
"a union's actions are arbitrary only if, in light of the
factual and legal landscape at the time of the union's
actions, the union's behavior is so far outside a wide
range of reasonableness as to be irrational." Id. at 67
(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).
Nothing in O'Neill suggests that the same degree
of deference is owed to a union's conduct in operating
a hiring hall. As the court of appeals explained, in the
hiring hall context, "the union has assumed the role
of employer, as well as representative, and * * *
the risk of judicial second-guessing of a negotiated

---------------------------------------- Page Break ----------------------------------------

11

agreement that was of such concern to the Court in
O'Neill is simply not present," Pet. App. 22.3
Petitioner similarly errs in contending (Pet. 10-11)
that the court of appeals' conclusion is inconsistent
with this Court's decision in Breininger v. Sheet
Metal Workers Int'1 Ass'n Local Union No. 6, supra.
Breininger held that a union operating a hiring hall
is not, "relieved entirely of its duty of fair rep-
resentation." 493 U.S. at 87. The Court explained
that, in the hiring hall context, although referring
workers to jobs "resembles a task that an employer
might perform[,] * * * the union is administering
a provision of the contract, something that we
have always held is subject to the duty of fair
representation." Id, at 88. The Court recognized,
however, that, "if a union does wield additional power
in a hiring hall by assuming the employer's role, its
responsibility to exercise that power fairly increases
rather than deceases." Id. at 89. Breininger thus
supports the court of appeals' conclusion that, in view
of a union's increased responsibility when it runs a
hiring hall, the "highly deferential" test of O'Neill

  ___________________(footnotes)

  3. Petitioner suggests (Pet. 11-12) that its authority in the
  hiring hall context was limited because "the contractor. re-
  tained `the right to reject any job applicant'" under the terms
  of the labor agreement between Rockford and the United Asso-
  ciation. However, the Board made no findings with respect to
  how the contractual language was applied in actual practice.
  In any event, regardless of whether Rockford could have re-
.   jetted a welder dispatched from the hiring hall, the opportu-
  nity for employment on the Rockford project depended on the
  applicant's ability initially to obtain a job referral from the
  union-operated hiring hall.

was not an appropriate standard for evaluating peti-
tioner's conduct. See Pet. App. 22-23.4
3. Petitioner contends (Pet. 12) that review is
warranted in this case because it `(squarely pre-
sent[s]" the "often mooted issue of Board jurisdiction
over fair representation claims, unrelated to discrimi-
nation based on union membership."
First, contrary to petitioner's assertion, this case
does not involve a duty-of-fair-representation claim
"unrelated to discrimination based on union member-
ship." Discrimination based on union "membership"
includes that which encourages "participation in
union activities" or encourages "adhesion to union
membership." Radio Officers' Union v. NLRB, 347
U.S. 17,40 (1954) (NLRA allows "employees to freely
exercise their right to join unions, be good, bad, or
indifferent members, or abstain from joining any
union without imperiling their livelihood," subject
only to proviso to Section 8(a)(3), 29 U.S.C. 158(a)(3)).
The court, in agreement with the Board, found that
petitioner operated its exclusive hiring hall in so
"subjective" a fashion that the system effectively

___________________(footnotes)

4 Even were petitioner correct that the "highly deferen-
tial" standard of O'Neill applied to this case, the Board never-
theless would have been entitled to enforcement of its order.
As the ALJ found, Union officials Galloway and Manning used
"at best a subjective test" for determining which rig welders to
dispatch from the hiring hall, and the manner in which the
hiring hall was operated effectively "discriminate[d] in favor of
associates of Galloway and Manning," making it impossible for
"[qualified welders such as Harper and Flowers [to] be con-
sidered" for referrals. Pet. App. 51. Such conduct in the
operation of an exclusive hiring hall may be fairly said to lie "so
far outside a wide range of reasonableness as to be irrational."
O'Neill, 499 U.S, at 67 (internal quotation marks and citation
omitted ).

"discriminate[d] in favor of associates of Galloway and
Manning." Pet. App. 27-28. Such discrimination un-
lawfully encourages union "membership" as to all
users of the hiring hall, for "the worker may easily
suppose that it is necessary to curry [union officials']
favor to obtain referrals." Local Union No. 277, Int'1
Brotherhood of Painters v. NLRB, 717 F.2d 805, 809
(3d Cir. 1983). Thus, the question whether the Board
has jurisdiction over "an unadorned fair represen-
tation claim" (Pet. 12-13) is simply not presented by
this case.
In any event, the decisions of this Court indicate
that the Board, has jurisdiction over duty-of-fair-
representation claims generally.  For example, in
Vaca v. Sipes, 386 U.S. 171 (1967), a discharged union
member filed a suit in state court alleging . that his
union had breached its duty of fair representation by
failing to exhaust contractual grievance procedures
on his behalf "arbitrarily, capriciously and without
just or reasonable reason or cause." Id. at 173. This
Court held that the state court hail jurisdiction to
entertain the suit. The Court excepted such duty-
of-fair-representation claims from the preemption
principle of San Diego Building Trades Council v.
Garmon, 359 U.S. 236 (1959). See 386 US. at 176-188.
In reaching that conclusion, the Court did not sug-
gest that state court jurisdiction was permissible
because the Board had no jurisdiction over the claim.
Instead, the Court's reasoning rested entirely on the
proposition that, although the Board had assert-
ed jurisdiction over unfair representation claims as
unfair labor practices under the NLRA, see id. at
176-177, state court litigation of such claims was
nonetheless permissible, see id. at 178-188. See also
Breininger, 493 U.S. at 75 (applying Vaca to duty-of-

fair-representation claims arising out of the opera-
tion of union hiring halls). The reasonable implica-
tion of Vaca and Breininger is thus that the Board
shares concurrent jurisdiction with the courts to
hear duty-o f-fair-representation claims, a view that
has been uniformly adopted by the courts of appeals. 5.
As there is no conflict among the circuits on the
issue, further review is not warranted.
4. Petitioner also contends (Pet. 16) that the Board
and the court of appeals were "wrong" to conclude
that petitioner breached its duty of fair represen-
tation in the circumstances of this case, because,
according to petitioner, its recruitment and dispatch
system were "predicated on the work record and
reputation for reliability of applicants" and was "actu-
ated by a desire to refer only qualified and dependable
workers." Petitioner's argument, however, is flatly
contrary to the facts, as found by the Board and the
court of appeals. The ALJ found that, "[w]hile the
record shows that Manning and Galloway attempt-
ed to refer only qualified and dependable welders, at
best a subjective test was used" (Pet. App. 51), and
that "[there] is no evidence of what criteria, if any,
Galloway used in referring employees" (id. at 53).
The court agreed, finding that, "[w]hile the parties
stipulated that [the Union] sought to refer `competent
