To FCC:

I am sending this in regards to the changing of the license
system in Amateur radio. I am against anymore changes in the
different ham license classes. I feel the no code license has
hurt the Amateur band enough without making it easier for people
to get on the HF bands. Lets leave something that works alone. If
anything I think the code requirements should be raised not
reduced. Morse code is still a very important part of Amateur
radio. There are times with bad band conditions or times when
you need to run a long time on low power and cw is the best way
to go with the lowest power for the longest and most dependable
time. We are already allowing these cheat books to give people
the entire question pool with the answers for people to get a
license. Have you ever wonder how the education of our young
people would be if we let them have the teachers tests for the
entire year in advance. Lets quit making things easier and
damaging the hobby any further. 

Thank you for your time.  I could name 50 hams here that feel the
same way. It's just ridiculous to continue giving our hobby
away......

subject:   Proposal to change rules as pertains to Ham Radio

Dear Sirs,

I would like the rules to remain as they currently are now...
The rules now provide something for everyone.  I am afraid any
"relaxing" of the rules will tend to compromise the fraternity
and send it down the "CB" road.....Thank you.

As a general class amateur of some 48 years and active on all
bands from 160 thru 2 meters I would like to share my views on
any propose changes.

I can really only speak to my class of license, in the early days
when the FCC gave the exams it took a great deal of effort to
pass the CW and the theory exams.  I would not like to see
novice/techs groupings with our class of ability.  Also since the
majority of communication is by phone vrs CW and where the CW can
use any portion of the operating  band I would like the phone
operators to have the same privileges.  I don't think that
changes should be made just to reduce paperwork testing.  The
amateur radio hobby as a long and proud history.   

Thank you

I am a VE and am liking what I hear-KEEP TBE CODE at 13 words per
minute for General and 20 for Extra. CW sets us apart as an elite
group and we like it. It works well and requires some skill and
practice which enhances the quality of our operators and their
level of dedication. Once we get bad operators on the air, it is
very hard to get them off. We can well do without the Novice and
Tech-plus classes. Take away my computer, my phone, my access to
satellite communication, my AC power(you can even take my
microphone) and I will still get through given time and a "real"
radio operator, I will get through.What is a ham for? Keep the
CODE or make it all CB because it ultimately will be if you do
not!... ..Ronald Grayeon

Subject:   AMATEUR RADIO LICENSING CHANGES     

DEAR FCC              
  
 AS A FAIRLY NEW HAM AND AS AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHER I AM
CONCERNED ABOUT THE POSSIBLE UPCOMING CHANGES IN HAM RADIO
LICENSING.
  
 A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO A FRIEND OF MINE AND THEIR SON WERE
LISTENING TO A CE RADIO THAT I USED FOR MY WIFE TO MAINTAIN
COMMUNICATIONS WITH ME WHEN AND IF I NEEDED HELP WHEN RIDING MY
MOTORCYCLE IN THE HILLS NEARBY. THE FRIENDS SON WAS INTERESTED IN
RADIO BUT WHEN HEARING THE FILTHY LANGUAGE OTHERS USED ON THE CB
THEY WERE NOT AT ALL ABOUT TO LET HIM HAVE A RADIO. ALONG CAME A
NEWSPAPER AD OFFERING CLASSES IN ENTRY LEVEL HAM LICENSING AND WE
ALL ATTENDED. THEIR SON HAD FOUND A GREAT NBW HOBBY FOR ALL OF
US.

   AS A HIGH SCHOOL KID I HAD WANTED TO BECOME A HAM AND EVEN
SPENT THREE YEARS IN ELECTRONICS CLASSES TO LEARN THE THEORY. THE
PROBLEM WAS THAT I WAS TOO SCARED TO ATTEMPT THE CODE SO I NEVER
GOT GOING TILL 1996!!!!  BOY AM I SORRY I DIDN'T WORK FOR IT
SOONER. I HAVE HELPED A COUPLE OF KIDS PASS THEIR NOVICE AND TECH
CLASSES AT MY SCHOOL. I'M PROUD OF WHAT THEY DID AND THEY WEREN'T
AT ALL SCARED OF THE CODE EITHER.

   OBVIOUSLY I'M WRITING IN CONCERN ABOUT THE LICENSING
PROCEDURES BEING RELAXED IN THE FUTURE. I'M PROUD OF WHAT I HAVE
DONE (13 WPM) AND I AS A TEACHER CAN TELL YOU THAT RELAXING THE
STANDARDS MAY SELL MORE RADIOS FOR THE MANUFACTURERS BUT IT WILL
HURT HAM RADIO AS IT EXISTS TODAY. MAYBE THE 20 WPM CAN GO BUT
NOTHING MORE . TESTING HAS BEEN EASY FOR ME TO THIS POINT
AND I KNOW OTHERS DON'T PASS SO EASILY, BUT I HAVE SEEN THE
RESULT OF RELAXING STANDARDS IN SCHOOl AND IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN A
NEGATIVE. ONE OF THE OLD SAYINGS IN SCHOOL IS TO SET YOUR
STANDARDS HIGH AND THE KIDS WILL RISE TO THE OCCASION. IT'S TRUE
AND I AM SURE THE ONLY ONE THAT WILL WIN ARE THE MANUFACTURERS.
YOU ARE THERE FOR US NOT THEM!!!!!!

   I GOT INTO HAM FOR THE QUALITY NOT WHAT CB OFFERED. I WAS
AROUND WHEN CB WAS STILL QUALITY AND THERE WERE LICENSES . THE
LICENSES VANISHED AND THE FREQUENCY WENT TO POT IN THE 1970.
PLEASE DON'T DO THAT TO HAM. WE KEEP HEARING ABOUT VALUES ON THE
NEWS BUT WE KEEP TRICKING OURSELVES WITH LOWER STANDARDS.

   AT THE END OF EACH SCHOOL YEAR I LOOK AROUND THE ROOM AND
THINK ABOUT KIDS I HAVE BEEN TOO SOFT ON, AND I FEEL BAD FOR NOT
PUSHING THEM MORE. DON'T DO THAT TO HAM RADIO. (I'M A TOUGH OLD
THROWBACK TO THE SOS BUT THOSE KIDS PROBABLY GOT MORE FROM ME
THAN SOME OF THE WOOSIE TEACHERS!!). HELP PROTECT THE FREQUENCIES
FROM THE CB-ERS AND LITTLE LEO GUYS. GIVE EVERYONE SOMETHING TO
SHOOT FOR NOT SOMETHING TO FALL BACK ON.

 SINCERELY,

(SOON TO BECOME ADVANCE)                                     
HOPE I FIXED ALL THE ERRORS
