          Memorandum

          To:       All Employees

          From:     Secretary

          Subject:  1996 U.S. Savings Bonds Annual Campaign

          Soon the Department of the Interior will be having it's
          annual Savings Bonds Campaign.  This year's campaign theme,
          "Today's Decision - Tomorrow's Security," challenges you to
          make a choice for financial security for you and your
          family.  Savings bonds are a stable, dependable way to lay a
          solid foundation for your future security.

          We are proud to offer our employees the opportunity to
          participate in one of the most successful ways to save.  By
          enrolling in the Payroll Savings Plan, you are ensured of
          the following benefits:

               1) Continued growth of your assets through regular
                  savings and the reinvestment of the interest you
                  earn.

               2) An affordable and flexible way to save.

               3) A competitive market-based interest rate.

               4) No state or local income taxes on your earnings and
                  deferred federal taxes.

          This year's campaign will be held from May 20 through June
          28, 1996. A co-worker will soon be contacting you to discuss
          the advantages of the Savings Bonds Program and to answer
          any questions you may have.  I encourage you to enroll in
          the Payroll Savings Plan or to increase your current
          allotment.

                                   Sincerely,


                              /s/ by Bruce Babbitt on May 20, 1996
