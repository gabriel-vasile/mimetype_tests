                 In the Matter of CARRIE L. McWILLIAMS
 
 
        Carrie L. McWilliams, St. Thomas, VI, Claimant.
 
        Ronald  L.  Page,  Manager,  Management  Programs  Division,
   Federal  Aviation Administration,  Department of  Transportation,
   Washington, DC, appearing for Department of Transportation.
 
   DeGRAFF, Board Judge.
 
        In  late  1996, the  Federal  Aviation  Administration (FAA)
   transferred Carrie L. McWilliams  from San Francisco,  California
   to St. Thomas, Virgin Islands.   In connection with the transfer,
   the  FAA authorized  Ms. McWilliams  to  transport two  privately
   owned  vehicles  to   St.  Thomas  because  her   husband,  Keith
   McWilliams, who  was also employed  by the FAA,  was accompanying
   her to St. Thomas and  they would need two vehicles  because they
   would be  working different  shifts.  The  FAA pays  to transport
   employees   vehicles to  St.  Thomas because  it  has found  that
   public transportation there is not dependable. 
 
        According to Ms. McWilliams s travel authorization, she  was
   supposed  to leave  for St.  Thomas  in early  July 1997.    In a
   memorandum  dated  February 23,  1999,  the FAA  states  that her
   transfer  was  effective June  30,  1997.    In her  claims,  Ms.
   McWilliams lists  her  period of  travel  as June  23, 1997.   We
   conclude that Ms.  McWilliams arrived in St. Thomas  in late June
   or early July 1997.  
 
        In December 1997,  Ms. McWilliams submitted  a claim to  the
   FAA  and asked  to  be  reimbursed for  the  expense her  husband
   incurred when  he rented a  car in St.  Thomas from June 7  - 14,
   1997.  According to the explanation that Ms. McWilliams submitted
   in support of her claim, Mr. McWilliams rented the car to commute
   to work at the  FAA facility.  He needed to rent  a car because a
   vehicle registered to him was supposed to arrive in St. Thomas on
   June 1, but  was misplaced by the carrier and arrived on June 17,
   1997.   The FAA denied Ms. McWilliams s claim because it found no
   basis  in  either  the  Federal  Travel  Regulation  or  any  FAA
   regulation for reimbursing her for the cost of the rental car. 
 
 
        In  January 1999, Ms.  McWilliams resubmitted her  claim for
   the expense of  the rental car  on June  7 - 14,  1997, and  also
   submitted a  new claim  asking to be  reimbursed for  the expense
   that Mr. McWilliams  incurred when he rented a car  in St. Thomas
   on May 13  - 21, 1997.   gMs. McWilliams s explanation as  to why
   her  husband  rented  the  cars  was  the  same  as  her  earlier
   explanation, and the FAA denied  these claims upon the same basis
   that it  denied the  earlier claim.   Ms. McWilliams  asks us  to
   review the FAA s decision to deny her claims. 
 
        It appears that Mr. McWilliams  arrived in St. Thomas before
   Ms. McWilliams, and that he alone used the rental cars to commute
   to  work.   If  this is  the  case, the  FAA reached  the correct
   result.    Although   agencies  are  permitted  by   statute  and
   implementing regulations  to reimburse transferred  employees for
   relocation  expenses,  neither the  statute  nor the  regulations
   permit an agency to reimburse an employee for  commuting expenses
   incurred  by a  spouse at  the  employee s new  duty station.   5
   U.S.C.    5724, 5724a (Supp. II 1996); 41 CFR pt. 302 (1997).  
 
        Even if  Ms. McWilliams  was in St.  Thomas before  June 14,
   1997, and  used  the rental  cars  to commute  to work,  the  FAA
   reached   the  correct  result.    Agencies  cannot  reimburse  a
   relocated employee for  local transportation expenses as  part of
   the employee s temporary  quarters subsistence expenses.   41 CFR
   302-5.18;  Ed  Gonzalez,  GSBCA 14602-RELO,  98-2  BCA    30,041;
   Thomas S.  Ward, GSBCA 13825-RELO,  97-1 BCA   28,955.   Although
   agencies can  reimburse employees for  transportation expenses if
   they  perform  official  business  travel, 41  CFR  pt.  301,  an
   employee s  usual  commute   between  work  and  home   does  not
   constitute official business travel.  John P. DeLeo, GSBCA 14042-
   TRAV, 97-2 BCA   29,156; Freddie G. Fenton, GSBCA 13638-TRAV, 97-
   1  BCA     28,712  (1996).   As  the  General  Accounting  Office
   explained,  [E]mployees are  expected to  get to  and from  their
   posts  of duty  on  their own  time  and at  their  own expense. 
   Guenther Moehrke, B-252142 (July 6, 1993).  
 
        Although it is unfortunate that Mr. McWilliams s car arrived
   later than it should have, this does not provide  any legal basis
   for reimbursing Ms. McWilliams for the expense of renting cars to
   commute to work.  The FAA correctly decided to deny the claims.
