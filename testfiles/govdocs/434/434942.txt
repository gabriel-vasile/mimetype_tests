Gentlemen:

What do we expect when a product is labelled "Made in the USA"?

We expect that it was made in the USA - parts and labor all originating in this country.

Most vendors agree.  We have noticed many "Made in..." labels clearly spelling out: "Made in the
USA of parts made in...... "Made in the US from imported parts", "Assembled in Mexico using
US parts", etc.  Just yesterday we looked at the 3-1/2" diskettes we are using (Fuji), stamped
"Assembled in USA." This is fine; we know what we have.

"Global economy," "changed circumstances" did not change our expectation of honest, clear,
dependable labelling.  If a shoe has soles made in China, say so.

Please do not change a requirement that worked well for all.

Very truly yours,



c: Rep. Sonny Bono
