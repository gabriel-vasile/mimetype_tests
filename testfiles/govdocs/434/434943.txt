RE: Docket No. 00N-1396, and 00D-1598

Dear Commissioner Henney,


As the owner of a small farm, I am writing to express my opposition to the 
 FDA's new proposed rule and guidance on genetically engineered (GE) 
Foods. I do not feel that there has been adequate testing to guarantee 
their safety when used in human food, and until this is done, I would 
strongly encourage you NOT to allow their use in food products.  Farming 
is difficult enough for small farmers to make a living; if you allow GE 
grain and other foods into the market, and they later prove to be harmful, 
then our role as dependable suppliers of safe foodstuffs will be severely, 
if not irrepairably, damaged. I doubt that the agency's voluntary labeling 
and notification proposals are adequate to protect this role, and possibly 
not adequate to protect human health, the environment, and each consumers' 
right to know. I fully support the following:

All GE foods and food ingredients should be labeled so consumers are 
informed and have a choice.

GE foods should NOT be assumed to be safe and should be subject to 
mandatory pre-market safety testing.

There should be a moratorium on GE foods until long-term studies show they 
are safe for human health and the environment

Your proposed rules ignore serious concerns, and appear to be a decision 
made to convenience large industry [NOT the small farmers] at the possible 
expense of the said small farmers, as well as public health and the 
environment. I realize that you will receive many letters on this subject, 
but I wish to state my own concerns to you for your consideration in this 
matter.

Thank you for taking the time to read this letter.

Sincerely,

G. R. Bond
