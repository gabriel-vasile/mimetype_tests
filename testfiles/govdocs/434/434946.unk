CLINTON ADMINISTRATION ANNOUNCES PILOT FLORIDA FRUIT TREE INSURANCE PROGRAM

     WASHINGTON, Nov. 7, 1995--Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman today
announced a pilot crop insurance program -- The Florida Fruit Tree Program --
to help growers in Florida replace or rehabilitate trees damaged by freeze,
wind or excess moisture. The pilot program was developed specifically for
Florida citrus and tropical fruit trees.  If this pilot program proves
successful, then this type of coverage may be expanded to other parts of the
U.S.
 
      "The Clinton Administration prepared this pilot program in response to
interest expressed by Florida growers," Glickman said.  "We appreciate the
efforts of the Florida Citrus Mutual, the Florida Fruit and Vegetable
Association, the National Hurricane Center and others in working with USDA's
Farm Service Agency to develop this program.  Given the threats posed by
freezes, wind, rain, and, of course, hurricanes, coupled with the variety of
non-traditional crops grown in Florida, producers face unique challenges. 
With the move away from ad hoc disaster payments, it is critical that Florida
producers have a dependable level of risk protection."
 
      Under the pilot program, coverage will be available for citrus,
avocado, carambola and mango trees in Highland, Polk, Martin, Palm Beach and
Dade Counties.  Growers with qualified tree losses would be paid a percentage
of the cost of replacing or rehabilitating damaged trees.  The cost of
replacing and 
maintaining a citrus tree for five years has been established by USDA at $26
per tree.  Three-year-old tropical fruit trees are valued at $35 per tree. 
Payments for younger trees will be prorated depending on the ages of the
trees.  

     To best protect against financial loss, Secretary Glickman strongly
encourages growers to buy the higher levels of tree coverage from local crop
insurance agents.  However, the local offices of the Farm Service Agency will
make available to growers the catastrophic or lowest level of coverage.  The
sales closing date for this coverage is December 8, 1995.  If producers buy
insurance after this date, it will not take effect until 15 days after the
acceptance of the application.
