 ORDER 
 Adopted:  October  27,  2004  Released:  October  28,  2004 
 By  the  Chief,  Public  Safety  and  Critical  Infrastructure  Division,  Wireless  Telecommunications  Bureau: 


 1.  On  March  20,  2003,  Entergy  Nuclear  Indian  Point  2,  LLC  (Entergy)  filed  a  request  for  a  waiver  1  of  Section  90.179(  a)  2  of  the  Commission’s  Rules,  to  permit  Entergy  to  be  eligible  to  utilize 
 certain  frequencies  3  allotted  to  the  Public  Safety  Services  Pool  4  in  order  to  better  serve  the  electricity  needs  of  New  York  City  and  to  coordinate  its  response  in  the  event  of  an  emergency.  5  To  the  extent 
 described  herein,  we  waive  the  Commission’s  Public  Safety  Pool  eligibility  requirements,  6  which  will  allow  Entergy  to  operate  on  the  requested  frequencies.  We  find  that  grant  of  the  instant  waiver  request 
 will  enhance  Entergy’s  emergency  communications  capabilities  at  its  nuclear  facilities,  ensure  reliable  electricity  service  to  New  York  City,  and  avoid  interference  to  public  safety  communications. 
 Accordingly,  we  believe  that  this  action  will  promote  the  public  interest. 


 1  Entergy’s  Request  for  Waiver  of  Section  90.  179  (filed  Mar.  20,  2003);  see  also  FCC  File  No.  0001242437  (Waiver 
 Request).  On  August  26,  2003,  Entergy  amended  its  waiver  request  to  reiterate  the  need  for  dependable  and  immediate  communications  to  provide  electrical  service  to  New  York  City,  and  to  respond  to  emergencies.  See  FCC 


 File  No.  0001242437,  Letter  from  James  W.  Palmer,  SAIC/  Entergy  Services,  Inc.,  to  Wireless  Telecommunications  Bureau  (Palmer  Letter).

 Waiver  Request  at  1.  6 
 Although  Entergy  requested  waiver  of  Section  90.  179(  a),  we  note  that  Entergy’s  request  would  require  a  waiver  of  the  Commission  Public  Safety  Pool  eligibility  requirements  and,  therefore,  as  discussed  in  para.  2  infra,  we  treat  the 


 instant  Waiver  Request  as  a  request  for  waiver  of  Section  90.  20.  47  C.  F.  R.  §  90.  20(  a)  (eligibility  criteria).

 I.  BACKGROUND 
 2.  Entergy’s  nuclear  plant  facilities  at  Indian  Point  2  and  the  facilities  of  a  commonly-owned  entity,  Entergy  Nuclear  Indian  Point  3,  LLC,  are  located  forty  miles  north  of  New  York  City.  7 
 These  facilities  supply  a  substantial  amount  of  the  electrical  power  consumed  in  the  New  York  metropolitan  area.  8  In  2001,  Entergy  acquired  Indian  Point  2  from  Consolidated  Edison,  Inc.  (Con  Ed).  9 
 As  a  condition  to  the  transaction,  Entergy  indicates  that  it  had  to  “relinquish  to  Con  Ed”  all  industrial  radio  10  frequencies  shared  with  Con  Ed  at  Indian  Point  2.  11  While  Indian  Point  3  is  located  adjacent  to 
 Indian  Point  2,  Entergy  states  that  it  would  be  very  difficult  for  the  facilities  at  Indian  Point  3  to  cover  the  daily  needs  of  both  facilities  given  that  Indian  Point  3’s  frequencies  are  already  heavily  utilized.  12 
 Moreover,  Entergy  indicates  that  additional  capacity  is  needed  to  allow  Entergy’s  security  officials  to  better  coordinate  a  response  in  the  event  of  an  emergency,  such  as  a  terrorist  attack.  13 


 3.  Entergy  contends  that  no  viable  frequency  options  are  available  in  the  Industrial/  Land  transportation  and  Business  Service  Pool  (I/  B  Pool)  below  and  above  470  MHz,  and  that  the  United 
 Telecom  Council  (UTC),  a  certified  I/  B  Pool  frequency  coordinator,  identified  the  subject  frequencies  as  potentially  viable  options  that  would  satisfy  Entergy’s  needs.  14  These  frequencies,  however,  are  available 
 only  for  Public  Safety  purposes  according  to  Commission  rules.  15  Entergy  therefore  requested  waiver  of  Section  90.179(  a)  of  the  Commission’s  rules  so  that  it  may  operate  base  and  mobile  stations  on  the 
 subject  frequencies.  The  Association  of  Public  Safety  Communications  Officials,  International,  Inc.  (APCO),  a  certified  Public  Safety  Pool  frequency  coordinator,  supports  Entergy’s  request  for  the  use  of 
 UHF  frequency  pairs  453/  458.7375  and  453/  458.8375  MHz.  16 
 4.  As  a  general  matter,  under  the  Commission’s  Part  90  rules,  17  entities  are  licensed  on  frequencies  in  the  category  or  categories  for  which  they  meet  the  eligibility  criteria.  Section  90.20  of  the 


 Commission’s  rules  contains  the  eligibility  requirements  for  the  use  of  frequencies  in  the  Public  Safety  Services  Pool.  18  In  general,  those  requirements  restrict  use  of  the  frequencies  listed  in  that  section  to 
 governmental  entities  and  persons  or  associations  that  have  a  direct  role  in  providing  emergency  or  medical  services.  19  A  waiver  of  Section  90.20  of  the  Commission’s  rules  is,  therefore,  necessary  to 
 permit  Entergy  to  operate  base  stations  on  the  subject  frequencies.  As  a  waiver  of  Section  90.20’s  eligibility  requirements  would  obviate  the  need  for  a  waiver  of  Section  90.179(  a),  we  shall,  on  our  own

 motion,  herein  treat  Entergy’s  request  as  seeking  a  waiver  of  Section  90.20(  a). 
 II.  DISCUSSION 
 5.  To  obtain  a  waiver  of  the  Commission’s  Rules,  a  petitioner  must  demonstrate  either:  (a)  grant  of  the  requested  relief  would  be  in  the  public  interest,  and  the  underlying  purpose  of  the  rule  would 
 be  frustrated  or  not  served  by  the  application  to  the  present  case;  20  or  (b)  in  view  of  unique  or  unusual  factual  circumstances,  application  of  the  rule  would  be  inequitable,  unduly  burdensome  or  contrary  to  the 
 public  interest,  or  the  applicant  has  no  reasonable  alternative.  21  We  find  that  granting  Entergy  a  waiver  of  Section  90.20’s  eligibility  requirements  under  the  circumstances  presented  serves  the  public  interest. 


 6.  As  an  initial  matter,  we  find  that  granting  the  request  for  the  specified  frequencies  will  not  frustrate  the  underlying  purpose  of  Section  90.20(  a),  which  is  to  ensure  adequate  spectrum  for  public 
 safety  activities,  and  to  avoid  interference  to  such  communications  from  incompatible  services.  We  note  that  APCO,  apparently  believing  interference  would  not  be  an  issue  for  other  users,  approves  of  Entergy’s 
 proposed  use  of  these  frequencies.  22  Further,  no  objection  has  been  made  by  any  other  public  safety  frequency  coordinator  against  Entergy’s  proposed  use  of  these  frequencies.  23  And,  no  evidence  has  been 
 presented  that  authorizing  Entergy’s  use  of  these  frequencies  would  result  in  an  inadequate  supply  of  spectrum  for  the  public  safety  community. 


 7.  While  Entergy  indicates  that,  under  normal  circumstances,  its  proposal,  if  approved,  could  cause  interference  to  incumbent  users,  it  notes  several  distinguishing  factors  are  present  in  the 
 instant  case,  which  show  such  concerns  are  unwarranted.  24  Entergy  states  that  interference  will  be  minimal  as  a  result  of  the  “unusual  terrain  situation”  that  exists  at  the  plant.  25  Further,  according  to 
 Entergy,  Indian  Point  2  is  located  on  the  eastern  bank  of  the  Hudson  River,  whose  steep  banks  surrounding  the  plant  will  provide  “terrain  shielding”  to  the  surrounding  area.  26  Additionally,  Entergy 
 indicates  that  its  transmitter  site  is  106  meters  below  average  terrain,  and  its  antennas  would  be  only  twelve  meters  above  ground.  27  Also,  the  application  lists  a  relatively  small  Kilometers  radius 
 (KMRA)  28  of  only  eight  kilometers  (i.  e.  five  miles).  29  Moreover,  there  is  only  ten  watts  Effective  Radiated  Power  (ERP)  for  both  base  and  mobiles  specified  in  the  application.  30  Taken  together,  the 
 technical  parameters  reflected  in  this  case  persuade  us  that  authorizing  Entergy’s  use  of  these  frequencies  would  not  be  likely  to  result  in  interference  to  public  safety  communications. 


 8.  Additionally,  Entergy  has  demonstrated  that  there  are  no  reasonable  alternatives  to  accommodate  its  described  needs.  Entergy  indicates  that  the  UTC  found  no  450-  470  MHz  I/  B  Pool

 21  47  C.  F.  R.  §  1.925(  b)(  3)(  ii). 
 22  See  APCO  Letter. 
 23  Under  47  C.  F.  R.  §  90.  176,  coordination  of  these  frequencies  requires  that  all  public  safety  frequency  coordinators 
 be  placed  on  notice  of  any  proposed  use  of  these  frequencies.  24

 KMRA  refers  to  the  maximum  authorized  distance  for  mobiles  from  a  center  point  (i.  e.  base  station  site).  29

 frequency  available  in  the  congested  New  York  metropolitan  area.  31  Entergy  also  notes  that  its  existing  equipment  would  not  be  compatible  with  frequencies  outside  the  450-  470  MHz  band.  32  Therefore,  to 
 deny  Entergy  access  to  the  requested  frequencies  would  frustrate  Entergy’s  ability  to  manage  its  communications  system  routinely  and  during  emergencies.  Such  a  result  would  be  inconsistent  with  our 
 recent  decisions  promoting  efficient  and  flexible  use  of  public  safety  frequencies.  33 
 9.  We  also  find  that  a  grant  of  the  Waiver  Request  would  be  in  the  public  interest  because  it  would  allow  Entergy  flexibility  in  managing  the  communication  system  at  its  nuclear  facilities.  We 


 believe  that  two  additional  UHF  frequency  pairs  for  expansion  of  its  existing  system  would  enhance  daily  operations  as  well  as  improve  communications  among  various  emergency  response  departments  at 
 Entergy’s  nuclear  facilities.  34  Moreover,  grant  of  the  requested  relief  would  help  avoid  disruption  that  could  impair  Entergy’s  ability  to  provide  safe,  efficient  and  reliable  electricity  service  to  New  York 
 City.  35  Finally,  grant  of  the  Waiver  Request  would  be  consistent  with  Commission’s  efforts  to  promote  Homeland  Security.  36  Therefore,  as  we  find  no  likely  interference  or  reasonable  alternatives,  we  conclude 
 that  waiving  the  specified  eligibility  requirements  is  warranted. 


 III.  CONCLUSION 
 10.  Because  of  our  need  to  be  attentive  to  Homeland  Security  concerns  such  as  enhancing  emergency  communication  capabilities  at  a  nuclear  plant,  because  Entergy’s  use  of  the  requested 
 frequencies  would  substantially  help  New  York  City  in  satisfying  its  need  for  reliable  electricity,  and  because  we  anticipate  no  likely  interference  to  any  other  user  from  Entergy’s  proposed  use  of  the 
 requested  frequencies  for  its  system,  we  find  that  a  grant  of  Entergy’s  Waiver  Request  is  warranted.  We  believe  that  granting  the  Waiver  Request  serves  the  public  interest.  By  allowing  efficient  use  of  the 
 subject  spectrum,  the  action  taken  today  will  provide  improved  opportunities  for  communications  by  Entergy  where  no  reasonable  alternative  exists.  37
