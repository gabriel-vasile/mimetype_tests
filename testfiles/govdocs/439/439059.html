2.8	Portable
TAE Command Language (TCL)
</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The
dcl command allows you to put VMS DCL commands in your procedure, which are not
portable. The corresponding command under UNIX is 
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">ush</FONT></TT>,
which allows you to execute shell commands inside the procedure. 
<BR>
In
order to use the 
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">dcl</FONT></TT>
or 
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">ush</FONT></TT>
commands, there has to be some way of determining which operating system you
are on. A global variable called &#8220;$syschar&#8221; holds the type of
operating system. Index 1 in this variable is either &#8220;UNIX&#8221; or
&#8220;VAX_VMS&#8221;. For example:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>procedure
parm file string
refgbl $syschar
body
if ($syschar(1) = "UNIX")
  ush rm &amp;file
else
  dcl delete &amp;file
end-if
end-proc</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE>
Unfortunately,
there appears to be no straightforward way to determine the particular version
of UNIX, so use common shell commands. 
<BR>
Another
major trouble area for TCL is filenames. Filenames and path names look much
different under VMS and UNIX. There is a lot of TCL code in VICAR that parses
filenames, appends filenames to directories, etc. Many test scripts use
hardcoded VMS directories and filenames to find test files. All of these will
have to change. The same &#8220;$syschar&#8221; variable can be used to do
different things with the filename, or pick different testfiles, based on which
system you are using. 
<BR>
The
&#8220;$syschar&#8221; variable may also be tested inside help files, help
within a PDF, and menus via special conditional commands. These commands are
part of TAE, but they are not documented by TAE. The conditionals test to see
if the given string is in any element of the &#8220;$syschar&#8221; variable.
Like other PDF/MDF directives, they should appear on a line by themselves with
period &#8220;.&#8220; in the first column: 
</BLOCKQUOTE><UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Symbol">	</FONT><B>.if
<I>string</I></B>:
Prints the following lines (up to .elseif or .ifend) if 
<I>string
</I>is
in &#8221;$syschar&#8221;. 
<LI><FONT FACE="Symbol">	</FONT><B>.ifn
<I>string</I></B>:
Prints the following lines (up to .elseif or .ifend) if 
<I>string</I>
is not in &#8221;$syschar&#8221;. 
<LI><FONT FACE="Symbol">	</FONT><B>elseif
<I>string</I></B>:
Prints the following lines of text (up to .ifend or another .elseif) if the
previous condition was not met, and
<I>
string
</I>
is in &#8220;$syschar&#8221;. 
<LI><FONT FACE="Symbol">	</FONT><B>.ifend</B>:
Ends a conditional clause. 
<LI><FONT FACE="Symbol">	</FONT><B>.if1
<I>string</I></B>:
Single-line conditional. Just like .if, but only the next line is printed, and
no .ifend is required. 
<LI><FONT FACE="Symbol">	</FONT><B>.ifn1
<I>string</I></B>:
Single-line negative conditional. Just like .ifn, but only the next line is
printed, and no .ifend is required. 
</UL><BLOCKQUOTE>
The
following example is taken from the TAE command mode help file (commode.hlp): 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>                CONT*INUE
.if VAX_VMS
                DCL              any-VMS/DCL-command
                DCL-NOINTERRUPT  any-VMS/DCL-command
.ifend
                DEFC*MD COMMAND=command-name STRING=replacement-string

...

                T*UTOR-NOSCREEN PROC=proc-subcmd  parameters
.if1 UNIX
                USH any-UNIX/shell-command
                WAIT-ASYNC JOB=job-name-list

...

                        RUNTYPE Command Qualifier (continued)

           If the command qualifier is set to BATCH, the following TAE
           message is displayed:

.if VAX_VMS
               Job (nnn) submitted to queue (que)

           where "nnn" is the assigned job number and "que" is
           the name of the queue the job was submitted to.

.elseif UNIX
                Batch job file "filename" submitted successfully.

           where "filename" is the batch job file name, defined
           as "proc".job.

.ifend</PRE><P ALIGN="LEFT"><TT><FONT FACE="Courier">R</FONT></TT>efer
