Introduction

The Young Scholars' Program of the National Science Foundation is designed to
stimulate and extend the interests in science and mathematics of students
entering grades seven through twelve. An additional goal of the program is to
encourage them to investigate and pursue careers in science, mathematics,
engineering, and technology.

The Program strongly emphasizes student participation in the process of
scientific discovery through interaction with practicing scientists in the
laboratory and the field. Projects offer a combination of instruction,
research and problem-solving activities along with opportunities to explore
career options and confront issues of ethics in science. These projects focus
on a variety of disciplines including mathematics, computer science,
engineering, chemistry, life sciences, physics, and the earth sciences.

This directory lists the 114 Young Scholars projects scheduled for 1996 that
will take place at sites throughout the United States, including university
and college campuses, research vessels, archaeological digs, museums, glacier
fields, and zoological gardens. In addition to the summer activities,
follow-up occurs during the academic year, often involving parents, other
students and teachers in the home schools.

The entries in this directory are organized by the state of the sponsoring
institution. Some projects draw participants from the immediate local
vicinity, others accept applications state-wide, some are regional, and still
others are national in scope. Each program has some form of financial aid
available to help pay expenses, and some provide stipends. Please note that
program dates and application deadlines vary, as do disciplinary and grade
level emphases. Some projects may have additional admissions criteria which
are not included in the directory. For such information, application forms,
and other particulars, interested persons must contact the project directly.
NSF staff cannot provide this information. In some cases vacancies develop or
lists of alternates are maintained, so it may prove worthwhile to inquire even
after the stated deadline.

Additional copies of this directory are available from NSF Forms and
Publications by phone at (703) 306-1130, by fax machine at (703) 644-4278,
electronically by e-mail at pubs@nsf.gov, or by reaching NSF's World Wide Web
