<h3><a class="aname" name="toc">Frequently Asked Questions</a></h3>
<p>
With a site of this size, and the quantity of imagery available,
there are always some questions that arise.  This page is intended
to help answer some of the more common ones.

<dl>

  <dt>
<a class="aname" name="q1">Why do the images redirect me to another
server?</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
With the quantity of imagery, it was determined that having a single
image server available for serving up imagery was preferable to the
old practice of keeping all files on the single server.  This way, both
servers can be optimized for handling their tasks, providing a better
end user experience.
  </dd>

  <dt>
<a class="aname" name="q2">Why can't I just download the larger files 
directly?</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
When the Visible Earth relaunched in 2005, all imagery on the site
was available for immediate HTTP download.  Unfortunately, this started
to generate maintenance problems, as folks downloading the larger Blue 
Marble imagery (~400M) would be connected to the server for a very long time.
Frequently they would be forcibly disconnected for maintenance, causing their
downloads to abort.  When Blue Marble: Next Generation launched, we had
a large influx of files of equal, and LARGER, sizes.  Since this would
require more people to be dropped regularly, we decided to look for
other ways of resolving the download options.
  </dd>

  <dt>
<a class="aname" name="q3">I found a really cool image that I want to use
for something, what is the policy for letting me?</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
We provide the imagery for everyone to view, use, and admire.  If you 
are planning to distribute the image with or in something, please have a 
look at our <a href="useterms.php">Terms of Use</a> document.

<h3><a class="aname" name="torrent">Bit Torrent</a></h3>
<dl>

    <a class="aname" name="bt1">
      What is BitTorrent?
    </a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
BitTorrent is a distributed peer-to-peer filesharing protocol.  It allows
many people to download an object (imagery in our case), without overstraining
the hosting server.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a class="aname" name="bt2">
      So ... What is BitTorrent?
    </a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
It's a protocol, like HTTP and FTP, that allows for the distribution of
large files.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a class="aname" name="bt3">
      I thought P2P and Filesharing were illegal!
    </a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
This is a common misconception.  BitTorrent, and peer-to-peer (P2P) are
protocols, like HTTP and EMail.  It is true that they can be used to 
share files illegally, but the same is true of HTTP.  Our use here is
legitimate, however, so you should have no need to be concerned.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a class="aname" name="bt4">
      How do I download BitTorrent files?
    </a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
BitTorrent files (called torrents, and identifiable by the .torrent ending)
are downloaded like any other file.  They are then opened by the BitTorrent
program (available at <a href="http://www.bittorrent.com/" target="_blank">
http://www.bittorrent.com/</a>), which will connect to the peer network
and find places that it can start fetching the file from.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a class="aname" name="bt5">
      How does it work?
    </a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
BitTorrent connects to a central server, defined by the torrent file,
which keeps track of who is working on downloading the file.  The protocol
then begins to request pieces of the file from all other downloaders, starting
with the file parts that are least commonly available.  The protocol assumes
that the majority of users are not fully utilizing their bandwidth and 
provides the ability to download from "peers" in that extra margin.
For full details, please check the <a href="http://www.bittorrent.com/"
target="_blank">Official BitTorrent</a> site.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a class="aname" name="bt6">
      Isn't that insecure?
    </a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
BitTorrent will only provide files to other users that you tell it to allow.
Usually this will be limited to files that you are currently downloading,
yourself.  But after you have finished, you can allow it to continue uploading
(called seeding), so that others can download easier.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a class="aname" name="bt7">
      What should I be aware of with BitTorrent?
    </a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
You should always be careful to check that your BitTorrent client and the
torrent you are downloading are both "safe".  Making sure your client is 
safe can be mostly handled by downloading the "official" client (from 
<a href="http://www.bittorrent.com/" target="_blank">
http://www.bittorrent.com/</a>, or one of the clients they link.  There
are many other clients available, and we have not tested them all, and 
we cannot speak for their validity, of course.  Making sure that your torrent
is safe simply means to only download torrents from "reputable sources". 
We like to believe that we are one.  It is possible for someone to "poison"
a torrent, which leads to it downloading spyware or other malicious 
software instead of what you thought it would download, so it is always
recommended to run each file you finish downloading through an anti-virus
scan before attempting to open it.
