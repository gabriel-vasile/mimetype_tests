<BODY>
<H2><B><A NAME="Part7-5">5. Unique Patient Identifier based on Personal
Immutable Properties</A></B></H2>
<H4>I. Description of the Option</H4>
<P>This method has been proposed by Drs. Paul Carpenter and Chris Chute of Mayo
Clinic.  It is based on an individual's immutable personal properties. Both Dr.
Carpenter and Dr. Chute believe that in addition to characteristics such as
uniqueness, verifiability, reliability and administrative ease, the Unique
Patient Identifier (UPI) should be based on immutable personal properties rather
than those which may be changed by political or personal whim (i.e. last name,
town, state, country etc.).   Their model consists of three universal immutable
values plus a check digit.  The three values are 1) a seven-digit date of birth
field, 2) a six-digit place of birth code, 3) a five-digit sequence code (to
identify the individual born on the same date in the same geographic area)   and
4) a single-check digit.  The place of birth code identifies world grid
coordinates using 360 degrees for longitude and 180 degrees for latitude. Each
increment of a degree represent approximately 70 square miles.  Local
organizations can administer the Unique Patient Identifier and forward it to an
international registry such as World Health Organization.  </P>
<P>For emergency situations a temporary UPI with the prefix &quot;T&quot; is
recommended.   This model also recommends the adoption of a base 34-character
representation of the UPI for personal memory and ease of use and entry into
electronic medical record of the future.  Although the proposal does not address
the Central Issuing Authority, it indicates the need for a central registry at
an organization such as WHO to compare and link records. </P>
<P>Just like other proposals, the Unique Patient Identifier based on Personal
Immutable Properties is also at a conceptual stage.   Therefore, the method
needs to progress from the conceptual stage to specification, design,
development, testing and large scale deployment in order to meet the
requirements of the healthcare industry.</P>

<OL>
<LI> The Unique Patient Identifier based on Personal Immutable Properties has
been        proposed by Paul C. Carpenter, M.D. and Christopher Chute, M.D.  
</LI>
<LI> The method is described in their article published in JAMIA in 1994
</LI></OL>
<H4>III. Compliance with ASTM Conceptual Characteristics</H4>
<H5><I>a) Functional Characteristics</I></H5>
<P><I><B>Accessible</B></I><B>: </B>Local organizations can handle the issue
of Unique Patient Identifier.</P>
<P><I><B>Assignable</B></I><B>: </B>Requires local issuing authority to
assign the Unique Patient Identifier and forward it to an international
authority such as WHO.  The required specifications, design, development,
testing and deployment are yet to be organized, and the establishment of a local
and international authority and their functions are yet to be planned.</P>
<P><I><B>Identifiable: </B></I>Requires the local registry organization to
collect demographic data.   </P>
<P><I><B>Verifiable:</B></I><B> </B>Check-digit verification is included in
the proposal.</P>
<P><I><B>Mergeable: </B></I>Requires central registry to compare information
supplied by the local registry and perform the necessary linkages </P>
<P><I><B>Splittable:</B></I><B> </B>Requires central registry to compare
information supplied by the local registry and take the necessary steps</P>
<H5><I><B>b) Linkage of Lifelong Health Record </B></I></H5>
<P><I><B>Linkable: </B></I>The Personal Immutable Properties-based Unique
Patient Identifier can be used to link patient records from multiple sources.</P>
<P><I><B>Mappable: </B></I>Bidirectional linkage is possible between the
Personal Immutable Properties-based Unique Patient Identifier and the existing
identifiers. </P>
<H5><B><I>c) Patient Confidentiality and Security</I></B></H5>
<P><I><B>Content Free:</B></I><B> </B>The Identifier is created from
personal immutable properties and therefore, is not content-free.</P>
<P><I><B>Controllable: </B></I>The Personal Immutable Properties-based Unique
Patient Identifier can be encrypted.  However, encryption is not included in the
proposal.</P>
<P><I><B>Healthcare Focused: </B></I>The proposal is made for healthcare
purpose. </P>
<P><I><B>Secure: </B></I>Encryption is not addressed in the proposal.  The
Personal Immutable Properties-based Unique Patient Identifier can be encrypted
and security can be administered by the local issuing authority.</P>
<P><I><B>Disidentifiable: </B></I>Encryption is not included in the proposal.
The Personal Immutable Properties-based Unique Patient Identifier can be
encrypted in multiple ways. </P>
<P><I><B>Public: </B></I>Public disclosure of the Unique Patient Identifier
without risk to privacy and confidentiality of patient information is not
discussed in the proposal.  The Personal Immutable Properties-based Unique
Patient Identifier contains personal information about the individual. 
Therefore, it is not a public information. </P>
<H5><B><I>d) Compatibility with Standards and Technology</I></B></H5>
<P><B><I>Based on Industry Standards</I>: </B>Not based on industry standard.</P>
<P><B><I>Deployable:</I> </B>Does not indicate any barriers.</P>
<P><I><B>Usable:</B></I><B> </B>The model recommends the adoption of a base
34-character representation of the UPI for personal memory and ease of use and
entry into electronic medical record of the future.  The 19-character length and
the mathematics involved will present difficulty for manual calculation and use.</P>
<H5><B><I>e) Design Characteristics</I></B></H5>
<P><B><I>Unique:</I> </B>The three immutable personal properties namely date
birth, place of birth and the sequential identifier assure the uniqueness of the
identifier.</P>
<P><I><B>Repository-based:</B></I><B> </B>The patient ID is made up of the
patient's personal properties information.  The use of other demographic
identification information is not discussed in the proposal.  However, there is
no inherent barriers to maintaining a repository.</P>
<P><I><B>Atomic: </B></I>This  model consists of a series of three universal
immutable values plus a check digit.  It can be considered a single compound
data element.</P>
<P><I><B>Concise: </B></I>This  model consists of a 19 character length
identifier which will be difficult for manual use.</P>
<P><I><B>Unambiguous: </B></I>The identifier uses numeric characters only and
does not present ambiguity.</P>
<P><I><B>Permanent: </B></I>The identifier is intended as a permanent
identifier. </P>
<P><I><B>Centrally governed:</B></I> The proposal recommends local
organizations to issue identifiers and function as local registries and report
to the central organization such as WHO.</P>
<P><I><B>Networked:</B></I><B> </B>This identifier can be operated on
network.</P>
<P><I><B>Longevity</B></I><B>: </B>The method is capable of functioning for
a foreseeable future. </P>
<P><I><B>Retroactive:</B></I><B> </B>Unique Patient Identifiers can be
assigned to existing individuals retroactively.  However, the sequence code for
individuals born on the same date may not be in the intended sequence while
retrospectively assigning their ID.  </P>
<P><I><B>Universal:</B></I><B> </B>This method can support identification of
every living person for a foreseeable future.</P>
<P><I><B>Incremental Implementation:</B></I><B> </B>The proposal does not
address the implementation approach.  This method can be implemented
incrementally.</P>
<H5><B><I>f) Reduction of  Cost and Enhanced Health Status</I></B></H5>
<P><B>Cost-effectiveness:</B> This is subject to specification, design,
development, testing and deployment that are yet to be organized.</P>
<H4><B>IV. Compliance with Operational Characteristics and                    
            Readiness</B></H4>
<P><B><I>Currently operational: </I></B>The Unique Patient Identifier based
on Personal Immutable Properties is not currently operational. </P>
<P><B><I>Existing infrastructure: </I></B>Administrative and technical
infrastructures are not ready yet.</P>
<P><I><B>Readiness of the required technology: </B></I>The necessary
technology and check-digit methodologies are ready and available for use.</P>
<P><I><B>Timeliness: </B></I>The proposal does not address the implementation
approach.  The set-up  of administrative and technology infrastructures (Central
Trusted Authority, software, hardware, communication network, etc.), and the
development of implementation methodology, policies and procedures, etc. must be
completed before the nation-wide implementation.  The implementation of an
entirely new system will require  substantial amount of time. </P>
<P><I><B>Adequacy of information to support identification functions:</B></I>
The identification data base and its contents have not been addressed.  The
Unique Patient Identifier based on Personal Immutable Properties still remains
only as a concept.</P>
<H4><B>V. Compliance with Unique Patient Identifier Components Requirements</B></H4>
<H5><B><I>Identifier</I></B></H5>
<P>The focus of the Unique Patient Identifier based on Personal Immutable
Properties is mainly on the Identifier Component.  The model consists of 1) a
seven-digit date of birth field, 2) a six-digit place of birth code, 3) a
five-digit sequence code (to identify the individual born on the same date in
the same geographic area)  and 4) a single digit check-digit.  For easy
representation the method recommends the use of a 34 base number.  The 19
character ID length and the mathematics involved will be difficult for manual
calculation and use.</P>
<H5><B><I>Identification Information </I></B></H5>
<P>The method will require the use of a patient's identifying data elements
such as name, date of birth, sex, etc.  But it does not address the content or
structure of the data base that will contain such data elements.</P>
<H5><B><I>Index</I></B></H5>
<P>The proposal indicates that both local and central registries will exist. 
It does not address its content or the use of an index such as a Master Patient
Index.</P>
<H5><I><B>Mechanism to protect, mask or encrypt the identifier</B></I></H5>
<P>Does not use encryption</P>
<H5><I><B>Technology Infrastructure</B></I></H5>
<P>Does not have an existing technology infrastructure and is not addressed in
the proposal</P>
<H5><I><B>Administrative Infrastructure</B></I></H5>
<P>Does not have an existing administrative infrastructure. The proposal
indicates that both local and central registries will exist, but it does not
include a proposal for the administrative infrastructure.</P>
<H4>VI Compliance with Basic Functions Criteria</H4>
<P>Compliance with the basic functions criteria depends on the identifier's 
compliance with operational characteristics and the identifier components
requirements.  The Unique Patient Identifier based on Personal Immutable
Properties mainly addresses the identifier component and does not meet several
of the operational characteristics. Its ability to meet the basic functions of
the Unique Patient Identifier will depend on the inclusion of the remaining five
components and the required operational characteristics.  It will be unable to
meet the basic functions discussed below without them. </P>
<H4>Identification of individuals</H4>
<P><B><I>Delivery of care functions: </I></B>The Personal Immutable
Properties based Unique Patient Identifier's capability to support the positive
identification of an individual during the course of active treatment will
depend on its ability to address both the  implementation of the remaining
identifier components and all of the operational requirements. </P>
<P><I><B>Administrative functions: </B></I>The identifier's capability to
support the identification for administrative functions required by
practitioners, provider organizations, insurers, HMOs, federal health plan
agencies, etc. will depend on its ability to address both the implementation of
the remaining identifier components and all of the operational requirements.</P>
<H4>Identification of information</H4>
<P><B><I>Coordination of multi-disciplinary care processes:</I></B> The
identifier's capability to Support multi-disciplinary functions and coordination
of care processes including, ordering of procedures, medications and tests,
communication of results and consultations will depend on its ability to address
both the implementation of the remaining identifier components and the
operational requirements.</P>
<P><I><B>Organization of patient information and medical record keeping:</B></I>
The identifier's capability to support the manual medical record keeping and the
automated collection, storage and retrieval of information will depend on its
ability to address both the implementation of the remaining identifier
components and the operational requirements.</P>
<P><I><B>Manual and automated linkage of lifelong health records:</B></I> The
identifier's capability to identify, organize and link information and records
across multiple episodes of cares and multiple sites of care will depend on its
ability to address both the implementation of the remaining identifier
components and all of the operational requirements. The length of the identifier
will not be conducive to manual use.  </P>
<P><I><B>Aggregation of health information for analysis and research:</B></I>
The identifier's ability to support the aggregation of health information on the
basis of groups of patients, regions, diseases, treatments, outcomes, etc. for
research, planning and preventive measures will depend on its ability to address
both the implementation of the remaining identifier components and the
operational requirements.</P>
<H5><B>Protection of privacy, confidentiality &amp; security </B></H5>
<P><B><I>Access Security:</I></B> The Access Security and the authentication
procedures needed to access the patient care information are not addressed. </P>
<P><I><B>Content-free Identifier</B></I>: The Unique Patient Identifier based
on Personal Immutable Properties is based on personal immutable properties.</P>
<P><I><B>Mask/Hide/Encrypt/Protect/Disidentify:</B></I> Does not include
encryption protection</P>
<H5><B>Improve health status and help reduce cost</B></H5>
<P>The method has the potential to support the functions of a Unique Patient
Identifier.  However, it will depend upon the implementation of the remaining
Unique Patient Identifier components and the capability to address all of the
operational requirements.  The establishment of both the administrative and
technology infrastructures, the design and development of computer software,
hardware and communication networks, and the implementation of security
measures, etc. will require substantial investment of resource, time and effort.
</P>
<H4>VII. Strengths and Weaknesses</H4>
<H4>Strengths:</H4>
<OL>
<LI>  The Unique Patient Identifier based on Personal Immutable Characteristics
meets most of the conceptual characteristics of ASTM (of the 30 requirements,
fully meets 23 and partly meets 1). 
</LI>
<LI>  It is a new choice that provides a new start and can be designed to
exclude known defects or limitations.
</LI>
<LI>  It provides an opportunity to design, develop and implement a system to
accurately meet the healthcare industry's need.

<H2><B><A NAME="Part7"> 6. Unique Patient Identifier based on Biometrics
</A></B></H2>
<H4> I. Description of the Option</H4>
<P>Biometric identification consists of patients' personal physical
characteristics such as finger print, retina scan, iris scan, voice and DNA
analysis.   Some of the concerns relating to this option are organ transplant,
amputation and diseases affecting organs (such as retinopathy).   Biometric
identification has been used by government agencies such as law enforcement and
immigration.  The photo included in an individual's driver's licence or employee
ID, thumb print in legal documents, etc. are examples of Biometric
Identification. Video-graphed,  photographed or scanned image will be used for
identification.  It can be stored in digitized format in computers and ID Cards.
Both for the issue and verification, the individual must be present.  The
process requires special purpose equipment such as scanner, video camera,
computer and card readers with the necessary matching algorithms. </P>
<H4>II. Author/Proponent and Documentation</H4>
<P>1. Biometric Identification has been in use for a long period of time in
various fields such as law enforcement, department of transportation, etc. </P>
<H4>III. Compliance with ASTM Conceptual Characteristics </H4>
<H5><B><I>a) Functional Characteristics</I></B></H5>
<P><I><B>Accessible</B></I><B>: </B>For accessibility, this method requires
the establishment of a local issuing mechanism for the identifier and a central
administration to handle its nationwide scope.</P>
<P><I><B>Assignable</B></I><B>: </B>In addition to the establishment of a
local issuing mechanism and a central administration, the physical presence and
cooperation of patients, the necessary tools and equipment such as scanner,
video, etc. must all be present and functional. </P>
<P><I><B>Identifiable:</B></I><B> </B>The physical characteristics used in
the Unique Patient Identifier based on Biometrics can be matched with the
physical characteristics of the individual it identifies.   However, additional
information such as name, date of birth, etc. must also used in the
identification data base.</P>
<P><I><B>Verifiable:</B></I> Verification of the identifier will depend on
the computer algorithm and equipment used</P>
<P><I><B>Mergeable: </B></I>Duplicate IDs can be merged via cross-referencing</P>
<P><I><B>Splittable:</B></I><B> </B>Same ID issued to more than one
individual can be handled by issuing  new IDs to both or one of the individual.
</P>
<H5><B><I>b) Linkage of Lifelong Health Record </I></B></H5>
<P><I><B>Linkable: </B></I>The Unique Patient Identifier based on Biometrics

for the issue, maintenance and use of Biometric Identifiers.</P>
<P><I><B>Deployable:</B></I><B> </B>The necessary technology and processes
to issue, maintain and use the Biometric Identifiers are available but,
considered expensive, time consuming and cumbersome. </P>
<P><I><B>Usable: </B></I>Other than an individual's photograph, the Biometric
Identifier is not conducive to manual processing. </P>
<H5><B><I>e) Design Characteristics</I></B></H5>
<P>The creation, maintenance and use of Biometric Identifiers such as photo,
thumb print, DNA analysis, retina scan, etc. will require special equipment,
processes and procedures. They will be required both at the issuing and the
verification points.  In addition, adequate communication and computer
capabilities will be required by all users of the ID.  Therefore, a Central
Trusted Authority to oversee the operation with the necessary administrative and
technology infrastructure is necessary.  </P>
<P><I><B>Unique:</B></I><B> </B>The information contained in the Identifiers
is unique.</P>

<P><I><B>Adequacy of information to support identification functions:</B></I>
The identification data base and its contents have not yet been addressed.</P>
<H4><B>V. Compliance with Unique Patient Identifier Components Requirements</B></H4>
<H5><B><I>Identifier</I></B></H5>
<P>There are several options available for a biometric identification such as
finger print, retina scan, iris scan, voice, DNA analysis, etc.  Scanned or
video graphed images serve as the identifier. The actual choice or choices from
these various methods for use in healthcare have not been made.</P>
<H5><B><I>Identification Information </I></B></H5>

<H4>VI. Compliance with Basic Functions Criteria</H4>
<P>Biometrics identifiers are currently used for applications that require
positive identification of individuals.  They are quite suitable for low volume
activities such as personal identification verification.  But their use in high
volume transactions processing such as record keeping, information management,
report generation, manual and or electronic exchange of information,
coordination of multi-disciplinary team work and sensitive and timely healthcare
delivery functions have not been tried.  The Unique Patient Identifier based on
Biometrics does not meet several of the operational characteristics and the
identifier components requirements.  Its ability will depend on the development
of a complete proposal and inclusion of missing components and operational
requirements.  It will be unable to meet the basic functions discussed below
without them. </P>
<H4>Identification of individuals</H4>
<P><B><I>Delivery of care functions: </I></B>The ability to support the
manual and automated identification of an individual during the delivery of care
processes will depend on the format and content of the identifier, its ease of

and the ability to meet all of the operational requirements.</P>
<P><I><B>Administrative functions: </B></I>The ability to support the
identification required by practitioners, provider organizations and secondary
users for administrative functions will depend on the format and content of the
identifier, its ease of use, the turn around time, implementation of the
remaining identifier components and the ability to meet all of the operational
requirements.</P>
<H4>Identification of Information</H4>
<P><B><I>Coordination of multi-disciplinary care processes:</I></B>
Multi-disciplinary functions and coordination of care processes including,
ordering of procedures, medications, tests, etc., communication of results and
consultations will depend on the format and content of the identifier, its ease
of use, the turn around time, implementation of the remaining identifier
components and the ability to meet all of the operational requirements.</P>
<P><I><B>Organization of patient information and medical record keeping:</B></I>
Manual medical record keeping and automated collection, storage and retrieval of
information during the course of active treatment will depend on the format and

of the remaining identifier components and the ability to meet all of the
operational requirements.</P>
<P><I><B>Manual and automated linkage of lifelong health records:</B></I>

The aggregation of health information on the basis of groups of patients,
regions, diseases, treatments, outcomes, etc. for research, planning and
preventive measures will depend on the format and content of the identifier, its
ease of use, the turn around time, implementation of the remaining identifier
components and the ability to meet all of the operational requirements.</P>

<P><B><I>Access Security:</I></B> The Access Security and the authentication
procedures needed to access the patient care information are not addressed. </P>

<P>The method appears to lack the ability to support several basic functions. 
It is missing several operational characteristics and identifier components. The
inclusion of missing characteristics,  establishment of both the administrative
and technology infrastructures, design and development of computer software,
hardware, and communication networks, and implementation of security measures,
etc. will require substantial investment of resources, time and effort.</P>
<H4>VII. Strengths and Weaknesses</H4>
<H4>Strengths:                               </H4>
<OL>
<LI> The Unique Patient Identifier based on Biometrics meets most of the ASTM
conceptual characteristics (of the 30 requirements, fully meets 20 and partially
meets 3). 
</LI>
<LI>  It has the potential to provide positive identification of the patient.
</LI>
<LI>  It avoids crossover problems from an existing system that need to be
remedied or those that cannot be corrected retrospectively
</LI></OL>
<H4>Weaknesses:</H4>
<OL>
<LI>  The Unique Patient Identifier based on Biometrics in its current form
does not meet three of the five operational characteristics and the fourth one
is not fully addressed. 
</LI>
<LI>  It does not meet four of the six identifier components requirements and
the remaining two are not addressed adequately. 
</LI>
<LI>  Verification of the identifier requires special equipment, computer
software, and expertise (DNA analysis, Finger Print, Retina Scan, etc.).
</LI>
<LI>  Verification process for the identifier requires longer period of time
(DNA analysis, Finger Print, Retina Scan, etc.) and can affect the timely
delivery of care.
</LI>
<LI><I> </I> Biometric Identification is generally considered cumbersome and
time consuming to issue, maintain and use. <I> </I>It requires longer time
period to implement than other options. 
</LI>
<LI>   Since the Biometric Identifier contains an individual's personal
characteristics and information, the risk of violation of privacy and
confidentiality is greater than that of other options.
</LI>
<LI>  While Biometric Identifiers have proven to be a good option for Law
Enforcement and Immigration and Naturalization departments, its potential for
identifying individuals, linking and aggregating patient information from
multiple provider organizations for the purpose of delivering care or research
will depend upon its           design which is yet to be planned and developed.

</LI>
<LI>  Untested - implementing a brand new system nationwide that has not been
proven in healthcare industry has inherent risk for its success.
</LI>
<LI>  The required technology infrastructure and administrative structures need
to be established.
</LI>
<LI> The method requires creation of a Central Trusted Authority, development
of its organizational structure and operating procedures, definition of its
authority and an implementation plan.
</LI>
<LI> Overcoming/solving the above weaknesses will require a substantial
investment of money, huge effort and a longer time frame.
</LI></OL>
<H4><B> VIII. Potential Barriers &amp; Challenges to Overcoming the Barriers</B></H4>
<OL>
<LI> Inclusion of the missing identifier components and operational
characteristics
</LI>
<LI> Biometric Identifiers contain personal characteristic information.   It
poses threat to the violation of an individual's privacy.
</LI>
<LI> Unique Patient Identifier based on Biometrics is not ready for
implementation. It will present several challenges to completing the various
preliminary tasks including the nation-wide system design, development and
implementation.
</LI>
<LI> Establishment of the Central Trusted Authority and determining the
required administrative and technology infrastructure
