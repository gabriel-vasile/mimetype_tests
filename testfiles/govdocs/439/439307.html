<H2><A NAME="Part7-4">4. Cryptography-based Patient Identifier</A></H2>
<H4> I. Description of the Option</H4>
<P>Dr. Peter Szolovits from Massachusetts Institute of Technology recommends a
Healthcare Identifier System based on cryptography method.   It consists of the
use of two keys that allow arbitrary messages to be encoded and decoded.   These
two keys contain mathematical functions that are inverses of each other.   The
patient holds a patient private-key and the provider organization holds an
organizational (provider) public-key.  The two keys together generate and
maintain IDs that are both organization specific and unique to individual
patients within that organization.  The ID can be revealed to other institutions
or practitioners only with the private-key of the patient.  </P>
<P>The cryptography method supports both centralized and decentralized control.
Under the decentralized system, the patient has the ultimate control over the
degree to which the lifetime collection of medical information is made available
to others.  Every individual at birth is issued a private key and every
institution receive a public key.  The cryptography function computes
institution specific Patient IDs  using these two keys.  Under the centralized
system a central authority handles all private-keys via an ID Server. At the
request of authorized institutions, the ID Server will generate Patient ID with
the use of both the patient's private-key and the public-key.   Under both
centralized and decentralized systems, the use of smart card and the computer is
required.   A set of patient demographic identification is used to calculate the
keys which are used in turn to generate Patient IDs.   Based on the
identification information, a digital certificate is issued to each individual
which can be in the form of a smart card.  The keys and IDs are hundreds (100s)
of characters in length. </P>
<P>Due to the length and format of the ID, Dr. Peter Szolovits envisions his
method to evolve over a period of time.  In the initial stage, the ID will
function as a component of the patient demographic information and coexist with
the existing medical record number.  The initial function of this digital ID
will be exchanging information between organizations.  It will facilitate the
exchange of information without transmitting the medical record number itself,
thereby protecting the identity of the individual.  When the level of automation
and the use of computers have become universal, the digital ID will assume the
role of the primary identifier and function as the Unique Patient Identifier.  
To assure anonymity of  care and protection of  privacy, Dr. Szolovits does not
recommend tracking the various points delivery of care.</P>
<P>Automation and use of computer technology are prerequisites for the
implementation and use of the Cryptography-based Patient Identifier.  It cannot
be used in a manual environment.  The cryptography based method is popular in
the financial industry and it is used mainly to facilitate secure electronic
transactions over computer networks.  However, the Cryptography-based Patient
Identifier is still only a concept.  It needs to be developed further. Dr.
Szolovits points out that the cryptography-based public-key and private-key
method is a very powerful tool, and its creative application will yield
different degrees of privacy, convenience and flexibility.  Therefore, the
method needs to transition from the conceptual stage to specification, design,
development, testing and large scale deployment in order to meet the
requirements of the healthcare industry.</P>
<H4> II. Author/Proponent and Documentation</H4>
<OL>
<LI> The Cryptography-based Identification is already being used in the
financial industry for secure electronic transactions (SET) over computer
networks.
</LI>
<LI> The method is being recommended by Dr. Peter Szolovits, Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.  His article published in the Journal of American
Medical Informatics Association provides the outline for this method.
</LI></OL>
<H4><B>Compliance with ASTM Conceptual Characteristics</B></H4>
<P>Dr. Szolovits points out that in the initial stage, the Cryptography based
Identifier will function as a component of the medical record number to
facilitate exchange of information. Until the use of computer has become
universal, it will not be used as a primary patient identifier.  His concept of
ID Server, issuing authority, centralized and decentralized use, etc. need to be
developed further to fully understand the characteristics of the
Cryptography-based Patient Identifier.   </P>
<H5><B>a) Functional Characteristics          </B></H5>
<P><B><I>Accessible</I></B>: Dr. Szolovits, recommends a trusted
authority/institution such as a government or semi-public consortium to function
as a ID Server for the issue of the Cryptography-based identifier.  </P>
<P><I><B>Assignable: </B></I>The ID will be assigned by the ID Server. Both
the patient's private key and the provider organization's public key are
required.  </P>
<P><I><B>Identifiable: </B></I>The trusted authority will have the necessary
information to support the issue and maintenance of the Cryptography-based
Patient Identifier.  However, the necessary specifications, design and
development are yet to be planned. </P>
<P><I><B>Verifiable: </B></I>It should be possible for the trusted authority
to verify the validity of the ID.  However, no details have been included in the
proposal.</P>
<P><I><B>Mergeable:</B></I>This can be accomplished at the trusted authority
level.</P>
<P><I><B>Splittable: </B></I>This can be addressed with appropriate
procedures at the trusted authority level.</P>
<H5><B>b) Linkage of Lifelong Health Record        </B> </H5>
<P><B><I>Linkable: </I></B>The Cryptography-based Patient Identifier can be
used to link patient records from multiple sources.</P>
<P><I><B>Mappable: </B></I>Bidirectional linkage is possible between the
Cryptography-based Patient Identifier and the existing Identifiers. The proposal
expects it to be part of the patients demographic information in the initial
stage.</P>
<H5><B>c) Patient Confidentiality and Access Security</B></H5>
<P><I><B>Content Free:</B></I><B> </B>The patient's private-key and an
institution's public-key are based on their respective personal and demographic
information.</P>
<P><I><B>Controllable: </B></I>This method requires the trusted authority to
maintain security of the private and public keys and encryption information.</P>
<P><I><B>Healthcare Focused: </B></I>The Cryptography-based Patient
Identifier proposal is healthcare focused.</P>
<P><I><B>Secure: </B></I>This method requires the trusted authority to
maintain security of the private and public keys and related information.
However, the necessary policies, procedures, specifications, design and
development are yet to be planned.</P>
<P><I><B>Disidentifiable: </B></I>Encrypted identifier has the ability to
hide the identity of the individual. </P>
<P><I><B>Public: </B></I>Public disclosure of the Unique Patient Identifier
without risk to privacy and confidentiality of patient information is not
discussed. The private key and institution specific patient ID are not meant to
be public information.</P>
<H5><B>d) Compatibility with Standards and Technology </B>  </H5>
<P><B><I>Based on Industry Standards</I>: </B>Not based on existing Unique
Patient Identifier Standards.</P>
<P><I><B>Deployable:</B></I><B> </B>The financial industry is using the
cryptography method for secure electronic transactions. The Cryptography-based
Patient Identifier cannot be used in a manual environment.</P>
<P><I><B>Usable: </B></I>The identifier is in an encrypted format containing
hundreds of characters. It is not suitable for manual use. </P>
<H5><I><B>e) Design Characteristics  </B> </I></H5>
<P><B><I>Unique:</I> </B>IDs issued are institution specific.  Patients will
receive different IDs from different institutions.  Cryptography-based
Identifiers are not unique across the nation. </P>
<P><I><B>Repository-based:</B></I><B> </B>Patients' private keys will be
calculated from the patient demographic identification information.  Therefore,
such information can be maintained in a repository.  However, its design
especially relating to the issuing method (Centralized vs. Distributed) will
determine its feasibility.</P>
<P><I><B>Atomic: </B></I>The identifier itself is in the encrypted format and
can be treated as a single data item.</P>
<P><I><B>Concise: </B></I>The identifier is in the encrypted format
containing hundreds of characters.<I> </I> Therefore, it is not concise.</P>
<P><I><B>Unambiguous: </B></I>The identifier is in the encrypted format
containing hundreds of characters. Its content will not be meaningful for manual
review. </P>
<P><I><B>Permanent: </B></I>Patients will have multiple identifiers each
issued by different organizations that delivered the care. Even, within the same
institution, the use of different encryption scheme will yield different
identifiers.</P>
<P><I><B>Centrally governed:</B></I><B> </B>The issue and maintenance of the
ID can be governed both centrally as well as in a distributed manner.  They will
be subject to the specification, design, development, testing and deployment
that are yet to be organized. </P>
<P><I><B>Networked:</B></I><B> </B>Digital IDs, encrypted messages and
transactions are currently transmitted over computer networks.</P>
<P><I><B>Longevity: </B></I>This method can support patient identification
for a foreseeable future.</P>
<P><I><B>Retroactive: </B></I>This method can be used for retroactive
assignment of identifiers.</P>
<P><I><B>Universal: </B></I>This method can support universal use. </P>
<P><I><B>Incremental Implementation:</B></I><B> </B>Dr. Szolovits recommends
an incremental implementation.  In the initial stage, this ID will function as a
component of the patient demographic information and coexist with the existing
medical record number.  The initial function of this digital ID will be
exchanging information between organizations.  When the level of automation and
the use of computers have become universal, the digital ID will assume the role
of the primary identifier and function as the Unique Patient Identifier.  </P>
<H5><I><B>f) Reduction of  Cost and Enhanced Health Status</B></I></H5>
<P><I><B>Cost-effectiveness:</B></I><B> </B>This is subject to
specification, design, development, testing and deployment that are yet to be
planned.</P>
<H4>IV Compliance with Operational Characteristics</H4>
<P><B><I>Currently operational: </I></B>The Cryptography-based Patient
Identifier is not currently operational. </P>
<P><B><I>Existing infrastructure: </I></B>Does not have existing
administrative or technical infrastructure.</P>
<P><I><B>Readiness of the required technology: </B></I>The method requires
the healthcare industry to increase its level of automation and use of computer
in order to use the Cryptography-based Patient Identifier.  According to its
proponent, the initial role of this method is intended only for exchanging
information between organizations.</P>
<P><I><B>Timeliness: </B></I>The Cryptography-based Patient Identifier method
is at a conceptual level and needs to be developed further.  The level of
automation in healthcare organizations also needs to be increased before this
method can be implemented.</P>
<P><I><B>Adequacy of information to support identification functions:</B></I>
The Cryptography- based Patient Identifier is at a conceptual level. The
identification data base and its contents have not yet been addressed.</P>
<H4><B>V. Compliance with Unique Patient Identifier Components                
       Requirements</B></H4>
<H5><I><B>Identifier</B></I></H5>
<P>The Cryptography-based Patient Identifier is not a Unique Patient
Identifier.  It focuses on the use of private-key and public-key to generate an
institution specific patient identifier.  The keys and identifiers are of
hundreds of characters in length.  They are suitable for secure electronic
transmission of information but, unsuitable for manual use and cumbersome for
record keeping functions.    </P>
<H5><B>Identification Information </B></H5>
<P>The Patient identification data base and its contents have not yet been
addressed. </P>
<H5><B>Index</B></H5>
<P>The index that would link the identifier and the patient's identification
information has not been addressed. </P>
<H5><B>Mechanism to protect, mask or encrypt the identifier</B></H5>
<P>The identifier will be in encrypted format.</P>
<H5><B>Technology Infrastructure</B></H5>
<P>The technology infrastructure required to support the healthcare
identification functions has not been addressed.</P>
<H5><B>Administrative Infrastructure</B></H5>
<P>The proposal requires a trusted institution for centralized control and use
of escrow agents and trusted intermediaries for decentralized control.   But it
does not provide any specific solution.</P>
<H4>VI. Compliance with Basic Functions Criteria</H4>
<P>According to Dr. Szolovits, the main focus of this method is to make
unauthorized access to large scale medical information difficult.  Initially the
Cryptography-based Patient Identifier will be part of the patient demographic
information to facilitate secure exchange of patient care information and
eventually evolve in to a patient identifier once the use of computers by
healthcare has become universal. In addition, compliance with the basic
functions criteria depends on the identifier's compliance with operational
characteristics and the required identifier components.  The cryptography method
is at a preliminary stage. Currently the method does not meet all of the
operational characteristics and component requirements.  Therefore, its ability
to perform all of the basic functions discussed below will depend upon the
development of a complete proposal and inclusion of missing comnents and
operational requirements.</P>
<H5><B>Identification of individuals</B></H5>
<P><B><I>Delivery of care functions: </I></B>According to Dr. Szolovits, the
identifier will not support these functions initially. The use of computers by
healthcare organizations must become universal and their functions automated
adequately.</P>
<P><I><B>Administrative functions: </B></I>Patient identification required by
practitioners, provider organizations and secondary users for administrative
functions will not be supported until the use of computers by healthcare
organizations becomes universal and their functions automated adequately.</P>
<H5><B>Identification of information</B></H5>
<P><B><I>Coordination of multi-disciplinary care processes:</I></B>
Multi-disciplinary functions and coordination of care processes including,
ordering of procedures, medications, tests, etc., communication of results and
consultations will not be supported. The use of computers by healthcare
organizations must become universal and their functions automated adequately.</P>
<P><I><B>Organization of patient information and medical record keeping:</B></I>
Manual medical record keeping and automated collection, storage and retrieval of
information during the course of active treatment will not be supported. The use
of computers by healthcare organizations needs to become universal and their
functions automated adequately.</P>
<P><I><B>Manual and automated linkage of lifelong health records:</B></I> The
focus of the cryptography method is to facilitate secure exchange of
information.  Therefore, it has the potential to link information and records
across multiple episodes of care and multiple sites of care.  However, it  will
depend upon the implementation of the remaining Unique Patient Identifier
components and the capability to address all of the operational requirements.
</P>
<P><I><B>Aggregation of health information for analysis and research:</B></I>
The aggregation of health information on the basis of groups of patients,
regions, diseases, treatments, outcomes, etc. for research, planning and
preventive measures will not be supported initially. The use of computers by
healthcare organizations must become universal and their functions automated
adequately.</P>
<P><B>Support the protection of privacy, confidentiality &amp; security </B></P>
<P><B><I>Access Security:</I></B> The Access Security and the authentication
procedures needed to access the patient care information are not addressed. </P>
<P><I><B>Content-free Identifier</B></I>: The patient's private-key and an
institution's public-key are based on their respective personal and demographic
information.</P>
<P><I><B>Mask/Hide/Encrypt/Protect/Disidentify:</B></I> The identifier will
be in an encrypted format.</P>
<H5><B>Improve health status and help reduce cost</B></H5>
<P>The method does not support several of the basic functions initially.  It
has the potential to facilitate secure exchange of electronic medical
information and link longitudinal records.  It requires the use of computers by
healthcare organizations become universal and their functions automated
adequately.  </P>
<H4> VII. Strengths and Weaknesses</H4>

the five operational characteristics. 
</LI>
<LI>  It does not meet three of six identifier components requirements and two
more are  not addressed adequately. 
</LI>

have multiple IDs each generated by the public key of the provider. 
</LI>

the healthcare industry must be universal for this method to become a viable
patient identifier.
</LI>
<LI>  The Cryptography Method is at a conceptual level.   It requires
specifications, design, development, testing and deployment that are yet to be
organized. </LI>

been proven has inherent risk for its success. </LI>
<LI> The required technology infrastructure and administrative structures need
to be established.</LI>
<LI>  The method requires creation of a Central Trusted Authority, development
of its organizational structure, operating procedures, definition of its
authority and an  implementation plan.</LI>
<LI> Developing and implementing a new system without the above weaknesses will
require a huge investment of resources, substantial effort and time. </LI></OL>

<H2><B>5. Unique Patient Identifier based on Personal Immutable Properties</B></H2>
<H4>I. Description of the Option</H4>
<P>This method has been proposed by Drs. Paul Carpenter and Chris Chute of Mayo
Clinic.  It is based on an individual's immutable personal properties. Both Dr.
Carpenter and Dr. Chute believe that in addition to characteristics such as
uniqueness, verifiability, reliability and administrative ease, the Unique
Patient Identifier (UPI) should be based on immutable personal properties rather
than those which may be changed by political or personal whim (i.e. last name,
town, state, country etc.).   Their model consists of three universal immutable
values plus a check digit.  The three values are 1) a seven-digit date of birth
field, 2) a six-digit place of birth code, 3) a five-digit sequence code (to
identify the individual born on the same date in the same geographic area)   and
4) a single-check digit.  The place of birth code identifies world grid
coordinates using 360 degrees for longitude and 180 degrees for latitude. Each
increment of a degree represent approximately 70 square miles.  Local
organizations can administer the Unique Patient Identifier and forward it to an
international registry such as World Health Organization.  </P>
<P>For emergency situations a temporary UPI with the prefix &quot;T&quot; is
recommended.   This model also recommends the adoption of a base 34-character
representation of the UPI for personal memory and ease of use and entry into
electronic medical record of the future.  Although the proposal does not address
the Central Issuing Authority, it indicates the need for a central registry at
an organization such as WHO to compare and link records. </P>
<P>Just like other proposals, the Unique Patient Identifier based on Personal
Immutable Properties is also at a conceptual stage.   Therefore, the method
needs to progress from the conceptual stage to specification, design,
development, testing and large scale deployment in order to meet the
requirements of the healthcare industry.</P>

<H5><B><I>Identifier</I></B></H5>
<P>The focus of the Unique Patient Identifier based on Personal Immutable

seven-digit date of birth field, 2) a six-digit place of birth code, 3) a
five-digit sequence code (to identify the individual born on the same date in
the same geographic area)  and 4) a single digit check-digit.  For easy
representation the method recommends the use of a 34 base number.  The 19
character ID length and the mathematics involved will be difficult for manual
calculation and use.</P>
<H5><B><I>Identification Information </I></B></H5>
<P>The method will require the use of a patient's identifying data elements
such as name, date of birth, sex, etc.  But it does not address the content or
structure of the data base that will contain such data elements.</P>
<H5><B><I>Index</I></B></H5>
<P>The proposal indicates that both local and central registries will exist. 
It does not address its content or the use of an index such as a Master Patient
Index.</P>
<H5><I><B>Mechanism to protect, mask or encrypt the identifier</B></I></H5>
<P>Does not use encryption</P>
<H5><I><B>Technology Infrastructure</B></I></H5>
<P>Does not have an existing technology infrastructure and is not addressed in
the proposal</P>
<H5><I><B>Administrative Infrastructure</B></I></H5>
<P>Does not have an existing administrative infrastructure. The proposal
indicates that both local and central registries will exist, but it does not
include a proposal for the administrative infrastructure.</P>
<H4>VI Compliance with Basic Functions Criteria</H4>
<P>Compliance with the basic functions criteria depends on the identifier's 
compliance with operational characteristics and the identifier components
requirements.  The Unique Patient Identifier based on Personal Immutable
Properties mainly addresses the identifier component and does not meet several
of the operational characteristics. Its ability to meet the basic functions of
the Unique Patient Identifier will depend on the inclusion of the remaining five
components and the required operational characteristics.  It will be unable to
meet the basic functions discussed below without them. </P>
<H4>Identification of individuals</H4>
<P><B><I>Delivery of care functions: </I></B>The Personal Immutable
Properties based Unique Patient Identifier's capability to support the positive
identification of an individual during the course of active treatment will
depend on its ability to address both the  implementation of the remaining
identifier components and all of the operational requirements. </P>
<P><I><B>Administrative functions: </B></I>The identifier's capability to
support the identification for administrative functions required by
practitioners, provider organizations, insurers, HMOs, federal health plan
agencies, etc. will depend on its ability to address both the implementation of
the remaining identifier components and all of the operational requirements.</P>
<H4>Identification of information</H4>
<P><B><I>Coordination of multi-disciplinary care processes:</I></B> The
identifier's capability to Support multi-disciplinary functions and coordination
of care processes including, ordering of procedures, medications and tests,
communication of results and consultations will depend on its ability to address
both the implementation of the remaining identifier components and the
operational requirements.</P>
<P><I><B>Organization of patient information and medical record keeping:</B></I>
The identifier's capability to support the manual medical record keeping and the
automated collection, storage and retrieval of information will depend on its
ability to address both the implementation of the remaining identifier
components and the operational requirements.</P>
<P><I><B>Manual and automated linkage of lifelong health records:</B></I> The
identifier's capability to identify, organize and link information and records
across multiple episodes of cares and multiple sites of care will depend on its
ability to address both the implementation of the remaining identifier
components and all of the operational requirements. The length of the identifier
will not be conducive to manual use.  </P>
<P><I><B>Aggregation of health information for analysis and research:</B></I>
The identifier's ability to support the aggregation of health information on the
basis of groups of patients, regions, diseases, treatments, outcomes, etc. for
research, planning and preventive measures will depend on its ability to address
both the implementation of the remaining identifier components and the
operational requirements.</P>
<H5><B>Protection of privacy, confidentiality &amp; security </B></H5>
<P><B><I>Access Security:</I></B> The Access Security and the authentication
procedures needed to access the patient care information are not addressed. </P>
<P><I><B>Content-free Identifier</B></I>: The Unique Patient Identifier based
on Personal Immutable Properties is based on personal immutable properties.</P>
<P><I><B>Mask/Hide/Encrypt/Protect/Disidentify:</B></I> Does not include
encryption protection</P>
<H5><B>Improve health status and help reduce cost</B></H5>
<P>The method has the potential to support the functions of a Unique Patient
Identifier.  However, it will depend upon the implementation of the remaining
Unique Patient Identifier components and the capability to address all of the
operational requirements.  The establishment of both the administrative and
technology infrastructures, the design and development of computer software,
hardware and communication networks, and the implementation of security
measures, etc. will require substantial investment of resource, time and effort.

<H4>VII. Strengths and Weaknesses</H4>
<H4>Strengths:</H4>
<OL>
<LI>  The Unique Patient Identifier based on Personal Immutable Characteristics
meets most of the conceptual characteristics of ASTM (of the 30 requirements,
fully meets 23 and partly meets 1). 
</LI>
<LI>  It is a new choice that provides a new start and can be designed to
exclude known defects or limitations.
</LI>
<LI>  It provides an opportunity to design, develop and implement a system to
accurately meet the healthcare industry's need.
</LI>
<LI>  It avoids crossover problems from an existing system that need to be
fixed or those that cannot be fixed retrospectively.
</LI></OL>
<H4>Weaknesses:</H4>
<OL>
<LI>  The Unique Patient Identifier based on Personal Immutable Characteristics
in its current form does not meet three of the five operational characteristics
and the fourth is not fully addressed. 
</LI>
<LI>  It does not meet four of the six identifier components requirements and a
fifth is not addressed adequately. 
</LI>
<LI>  It remains only as a concept and its fruition will depend on significant
planning, preparation, specification development, design, testing and 
implementation.
</LI>
<LI>  Untested - implementing a brand new system nationwide that has not been
proven has inherent risk for its success.
</LI>
<LI>  The required technology infrastructure and administrative structures need
to be established.
</LI>
<LI>  The method also will require the development of an implementation plan,
creation of the necessary operating procedures, the definition of power and
organizational structure of the Local/Central Trusted Authority, and the role of
the World Health Organization (WHO), if any.
</LI>
<LI>  The<B> </B>Unique Patient Identifier based on Personal Immutable
Characteristics is not content-free. It contains the patient's date of birth and
place of birth. 
</LI>
<LI>  Development and implementation of this new method, after overcoming the
above weakness require a huge investment of financial resources, substantial
effort and time.
</LI></OL>
