<h1 class="right">FINAL MINUTES FOR SOHO 23 May 2008 SPWG MEETING</h1>

<h2 class="right">1. Boundary conditions</h2>

<pre class="listing">
a) Orbit, attitude and manoeuvres

- SOHO is in upside down roll position (180 deg).

- manoeuvres

  To the degree possible, manoeuvres take place during the last days of
  34-m keyholes.  Currently proposed or set manoeuvre dates are:

  Aug 19 (TBC)  station-keeping, momentum management
  Aug 22 (TBC)	roll



b) Communications with the spacecraft

  Graphical DSN schedule: http://soho.nascom.nasa.gov/soc/dsn/

  Keyhole dates for the next 6 months:

* Aug 01-30     26m Keyhole
* Aug 08-22     34m Keyhole

* Nov 05-22     26m Keyhole
* Nov 09-18     34m Keyhole

- The need and approach to reduce FOT manpower requirements needed for
  complex operations during the keyhole remains in effect until further 
  notice.

- All available keyhole information is at
  http://soho.nascom.nasa.gov/soc/keyholes.html. Direct link to the list of
  estimated dates for future keyholes is
  http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/soc/keyholes.txt.

- DSN D45 and D65 (34-m) antennae status

  D45 and D65 have been and currently remain down-link/telemetry-only, but
  are in the process of being upgraded with up-link/commanding capabilities.
  The estimated time for the transmitters to change to operational status
  is during the first half of July.

- End-of-pass handling during MDI continuous contact periods

  To avoid problems with transmitter masks at the end of passes during MDI
  continuous, DSN has requested we bring the carrier down 30 min before the
  end of pass.  As a result, the last 30 min of all MDI continuous contacts
  will be TM only.  For ranging passes, the spacecraft will be transitioned
  to record ~1 h before the end of the pass.  The station will drop the
  carrier and re-sweep into receiver 2.  The spacecraft will then be
  transitioned back to VC2 and VC3.



c) KNOWN submode (SM) dependent activities/submode changes:

* TOO           JOP153/MMOP003 Future Major Flare Watch (SM5 if SUMER
                observes target, SM6 otherwise)
* Jun 23-Jul 3  SUMER observing (SM5)
* Jul 23,30     EIT Shutterless #32 TBC (SM6)
* Nov           SUMER campaign TBD (SM5)

  Some of the default SUMER campaign dates overlap with keyholes - which is
  not a problem in itself (submode 5 will often be needed for keyholes
  anyhow) as long as potential periods of no SUMER data between passes can
  be accepted.

  Except for Major Flare Watches, TRACE will be doing full disk mosaics
  if/when EIT is not able to do synoptic sets due to keyhole operations.

  The Jun 23 to Jul 3 SUMER observations are in support of JOP 213 (see
  also section 2a) and in coordination with UVCS.



d) Instrument maintenance activities

  EIT bake-out periods will be during keyholes.  The most recent bake-out
  took place May 16-22. The next bake-out dates are TBD.



e) Others


  TRACE summer eclipse season begins on 10 May 2008.

  According to latest predicts TRACE summer eclipse season will end on 22
  Jul 2008.  The next eclipse season will begin on 10 Sep 2008. There is no
  predicted end for that eclipse season

  Unattended automated night passes for SOHO began October 6 2007.
</pre>



<h2 class="right">2. Priorities for the coming month and more</h2>



<pre class="listing">
a) Joint observing plans and campaigns


Continuing campaigns:

* 2002/02/25--  JOP136 Default RHESSI Collaborations (#6850),
                POC: Tero Siili
* 2003/05/13--  Default CDS Co-observations with TRACE (#6950)
* 2005/09/20--  JOP153/MMOP003 Future Major Flare Watch (#8008)
* 2007/03/20--  Default CDS/Hinode-EIS co-observations (#7200)

  Campaign #6850 is for "individual instrument studies" selecting an active
  region target [partially] influenced by the Max Millennium target
  selection to maximise chances of serendipitous co-observations.

  EIT supports all with half/full-res 195 A CME watch in submode 5/6. It is
  clear that STEREO-EUVI provides adequate "context" information for RHESSI
  flare observations. Routine EIT submode and resolution switches are
  probably no longer needed.


* Dec 2-May 28  Exceptional Ulysses Quadrature

  The Ulysses mission is expected to end in early June 2008.


* May 10-25     JOP 157 Emerging Flux in Active Region (BP) or in Coronal 
                  Hole (Jet) (#7274), EIT/CDS/MDI/Hinode/TRACE/THEMIS,
		  POC: Brigitte Schmieder

  EIT has supported JOP 157 using the 195 A filter. EIT went into bake-out
  on May 16 (see section 1d above), hence the support was limited to May
  10-16.

  MDI will support JOP157 with as many full disk magnetograms as possible
  during the keyhole.  May 16, 19, 20 and 21 are particularly bad days ---
  we might only get 2 synoptic magnetograms.  Daily information on
  magnetograms obtained can be found here:
  http://mdisas.nascom.nasa.gov/coordination.txt

  CDS has been supporting and will support JOP 157 as the keyhole schedule
  allows.


* May 10-25     JOP 178 Filament and its Environment (#7275),
      	          EIT/CDS/MDI/Hinode/TRACE/THEMIS,
                  POC: Sanjay Gosain

  Target-of-opportunity JOP in conjunction with the JOP 157; primarily for
  May 20-25.

  EIT: same as above for JOP 157.

  MDI: same as above for JOP 157.

  CDS has been and will support JOP 178 as the keyhole schedule allows.


* Jun 11-15     MDI Continuous Contact

  Note "End-of-pass handling during MDI continuous contact periods" in
  section 1b.
 
  MDI has not gotten any specific requests for this particular 5 day CC.
  MDI will do full disk, 1 minute cadence magnetograms and dopplergrams
  unless there is an interesting target in the HRFOV.


* Jun 23-Jul 3  JOP 213 Chromospheric network structure and dynamics,
                  SUMER/MDI/Hinode-SOT/SST/TIP II/ZIMPOL II,
                  POC: Anna Pietarila

  For details see the JOP 213 description at URL
  http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/soc/JOPs/jop213.txt.

  SUMER will support. See also below "SUMER observing".

  MDI has been asked to support JOP213 with HR magnetograms.  MDI will
  support this JOP as well as possible with the available high rate data.
  MDI has been informed of the change in dates.

  CDS is interested in participating --- requests to be informed of targets
  & times


* Jun 23-Jul 3  SUMER observing

  In addition to supporting JOP 213, SUMER will carry out coordinated
  observations with UVCS.

  SUMER proposes 19 Jun and 3 Jul as submode change dates.

  The SUMER/Hinode campaign originally scheduled for Apr 2008 is postponed
  until further notice.  The campaign will be structured as multiple JOPs
  in the same fashion as the 2006 SUMER campaigns have been.

  The June 2008 SUMER observation period will be of limited scale and
  scope, not a full-fledged campaign. Some of the JOPs outlined below may
  also be tested during the June observation period, but running them "in
  full" remains TBD.

  Currently submitted JOP/HOP proposals are (timings remain TBD):

  Jun 23-Jul 3  JOP 207 Eruptive and quiescent prominences Atlas with 
  		  SOHO and Hinode,
                  CDS/SUMER/UVCS/Hinode-EIS/Hinode-SOT/Hinode-XRT, 
                  POC: Susanna Parenti.
                  Timing TBD.

  Jun 23-Jul 3  JOP 208 Relationship between movements of magnetic 
  		  features and mass outflow in funnels, 
		  MDI/SUMER/Hinode-EIS/Hinode-SOT/Hinode-XRT/TRACE, 
                  POC: Hui Tian.

  Timing TBD    JOP 210 Checking the possible drives of solar wind origin 
  		  in the coronal hole,
		  SUMER/Hinode-EIS/Hinode-SOT/Hinode-XRT (all TBC),
                  POC: Hui Tian. 
                  Timing TBD.

  Timing TBD    JOP 211 How does the solar wind originate from the 
  		  quiet-Sun region,
                  SUMER/Hinode-EIS/Hinode-SOT/Hinode-XRT (all TBC),
                  POC: Hui Tian.
                  Timing TBD.

  Timing TBD    JOP 212 Connection between UV explosive event and 
  		  magnetic cancellation,
                  SUMER/Hinode-EIS/Hinode-SOT/Hinode-XRT, 
                  POC: Hui Tian.
                  Timing TBD.

  Only JOP confirmed to run is JOP 208, JOP 209 will not be run during this
  period. JOP 207 is a target-of-opportunity JOP. Confirmations on the
  running of the other JOPs (210-212) have been requested by the SOCs.

  SUMER also has plans for a dedicated observation "Lyman-alpha profile and
  center-to-limb variation".  The aperture door will be used to partially
  vignette the incoming photon flux, thus avoiding detector saturation.
  This has never been tried before. MDI and TRACE have been contacted to
  support this special observation.  The timing depends critically on the
  availability of NRT, since the operation (about 1 hour) has to be carried
  out interactively. Preferred dates would be 25 or 26 June.

  MDI can support JOPs 208 and 209 to as well as it is able depending on
  high rate telemetry availability. Probable forms of support are high
  resolution magnetograms with full disk as an alternative. MDI has
  contacted the JOP leaders about the need to coordinate MDI observations
  for each day.

  From MDI: SUMER has asked for specific observations June 25 and 26, we
  should try to get as much DSN coverage as possible (to enable VC2/VC3)
  during those days and probably for the Jun 23 - Jul 03 period.

  From June 23 to July 3 UVCS and SUMER will be coordinating targets for a
  campaign titled Polar Plume Observations. The objective is twofold: 
  1) infer the outflow speed wind profile in plume/interplume regions, 
  2) characterize the evolution in time of the morphological/physical
     properties of plumes.

  CDS requests to be added to the mailing list, as all JOPs of interest to
  CDS, particularly to co-observe with Hinode.

  EIT is waiting for JOP requests.

  TRACE has received a request for JOP 208/209 and plans to support


* Jul 9-13      MDI Continuous Contact

  Note "End-of-pass handling during MDI continuous contact periods" in
  section 1b.
 
  MDI has not gotten specific requests for this time period. MDI will do
  full disk, 1 minute cadence magnetograms and dopplergrams unless there is
  an interesting target in the HRFOV.


* Jul 23,30     EIT Shutterless #32

  Pass schedule times remain TBD, but are expected to be firmed up soon.


* Sep 24-28     MDI Continuous Contact

  Note "End-of-pass handling during MDI continuous contact periods" in
  section 1b.
 
  We may do high resolution observations for Helioseismology.  Observables
  will be high resolution magnetograms, dopplergrams and filtergrams at 1
  minute cadence.  FOV is TBD.


* Oct 15-19     MDI Continuous Contact

  Note "End-of-pass handling during MDI continuous contact periods" in
  section 1b.
 
  We may do high resolution observations for Helioseismology.  Observables
  will be high resolution magnetograms, dopplergrams and filtergrams at 1
  minute cadence.  FOV is TBD.


* Nov TBD       SUMER/Hinode campaign


* Dec 10-14     MDI Continuous Contact

  Note "End-of-pass handling during MDI continuous contact periods" in
  section 1b.
 
  Standard full disk, 1 minute cadence magnetograms and dopplergrams.


b) Intercalibration activities

  Last Intercal was: Apr 22

  May ICAL was postponed until after the keyhole

  ICALs are normally performed monthly. Below is a SOC proposal for ICAL
  weeks for the next six months.

* Jun 2-6       ICAL01 (#7113), CDS/EIT/Hinode-EIS/STEREO

* Jun 30-Jul 3  ICAL01 (#7113), CDS/EIT/Hinode-EIS/STEREO

* Aug 4-8       ICAL01 (#7113), CDS/EIT/Hinode-EIS/STEREO

* Sep 1-5       ICAL01 (#7113), CDS/EIT/Hinode-EIS/STEREO

* Oct 6-10      ICAL01 (#7113), CDS/EIT/Hinode-EIS/STEREO

* Nov 3-7       ICAL01 (#7113), CDS/EIT/Hinode-EIS/STEREO

  CDS views Hinode-EIS participation as extremely important.  STEREO-EUVI
  observations might also be used, but ICALs need to be scheduled not to
  coincide with STEREO manoeuvres or other interruptions in observations
  (see http://stereo-ssc.nascom.nasa.gov/plans.shtml). EIS and Stereo have
  been added to the Campaign #7113 description.

  Dates, details and confirmation will be determined by the planners. 

  EIT: ICALs are OK except (usually) during the weeks of shutterless ---
  whenever CDS prefers. All the dates proposed above are OK.

  CDS: OK --- dates TBD by the planners.



c) Individual instrument plans


MDI:

  See section 2a for MDI continuous contact periods.

  MDI may reduce the ALT cadence during Keyholes to be less than 15 ALT
  magnetograms per day if the lack of high rate telemetry is such that we
  will lose all or almost all of the 15 ALT Magnetograms each day.  The ALT
  cadence will be decided on an individual Keyhole basis and even a daily
  basis during each Keyhole depending on the 70 m antenna availability at
  the time.  MDI may also down-link select magnetograms in the 5 kbps
  telemetry if no 70 m passes are available at least every 2 days for Mag
  dump in the 160 kbps telemetry.

  All requests for MDI support need to be made several months ahead of time
  and sent to mdi-ops(at)mdisas.nascom.nasa.gov.  Even outside keyholes,
  MDI can only do 1-minute cadence observations when we have contact and
  there is no recorder dump in progress.

  MDI's REQUEST page is at http://mdisas.nascom.nasa.gov/coordination.txt
  NOTE: Listing of a study on that page means *only* that a request has
  been received, not that it will necessarily be supported.

  A description of MDI Observing Modes most used for JOPs and campaigns (FD
  vs. HR) can be found at http://mdisas.nascom.nasa.gov/Collaborate.
  Anyone requesting MDI observations is encouraged to read this page in
  order to have a better idea of what observing modes would be best suited
  for a particular study.  More detailed information about how MDI
  operates, observational constraints and telemetry information can be
  found at http://mdisas.nascom.nasa.gov/MDI_Collaboration_Details.

  MDI is in Focus 5 for best focus for FD observing.


UVCS:

  UVCS is scheduled to enter Keyhole Safe configuration on 8 May and
  Keyhole Recovery is targeted for 21 - 23 May TBC.

  For weekly plans, see the SOHO calendar and the UVCS planning page:
  http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/uvcs/observations/obst.html.


CDS:

  For details see http://solar.bnsc.rl.ac.uk/scientificops/request.shtml.


EIT/LASCO:

  EIT: 195 A CME watch plus synoptics at 6-hour cadence, as usual. Full-res
  CME watch whenever we're in submode 6. Hope never to change until the
  Bogart mission.

  EIT and LASCO will do the annual long/full calibration set during the MDI
  continuous (Jun 11-15 MDI Continuous Contact).  Calibrations will be done
  in real-time. June 11-13 still TBC.  EIT/LASCO would like Submode 6 for
  this calibration set, but it is not required.  The calibration set dates
  were chosen to be completed before SUMER campaign and Shutterless #32.


SUMER:

  Next SUMER observation periods:

  June 23-July 3
  Nov (timing TBD)

  See section 2a for details.


TRACE:

  NOTE that TRACE in general reserves the right to withdraw support from
  agreed, existing collaborations if a sufficiently "good active region" is
  called by the Max Millennium group.

  For TRACE summer eclipse season see section 1e.
</pre>




<h2 class="right">3. Any other business</h2>


<pre class="listing">
* Tentative SPWG meeting times for next six months (only the next one will
  be decided in this meeting). Meetings take place as a baseline on Fridays
  after the daily and weekly meetings.

  Jun 27
  Jul 25
  Aug 29
  Sep 26
  Oct 24
  Nov 21


The rest are FYI items:

* Hinode is currently experiencing technical difficulties that have
  resulted in a reduction in the rate at which scientific data can be
  transmitted to the ground from the on-board recorder. According to the
  Hinode Science Working Group "The problem will have a significant impact
  on how the Hinode mission is operated." For further details see
  http://spd.aas.org/SolarNews/archive/news.html#section1.

* In the future SOHO's DSN contacts will grow shorter as we lose 26-m
  antenna support and other, new missions get higher priority. The
  instrument teams are therefore requested to look at the NRT commanding
  that is done (especially for emergencies and recoveries) and see what can
  be converted into TSTOLs that the FOT can run (even without explicit
  instrument or SOC direction).

* MDI high-rate support requests: no change, see URL
  http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/operations/SPWG/spwg-20080118.html

* DSN support requests: preferably at least 6 months in advance.  Keep this
  in mind for: ground-based collaborations that require MDI support,
  stellar/shutterless observations that require NRT, etc.

* Future Mercury and Venus transits: no change, see URL
  http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/operations/SPWG/spwg-20080118.html

* Hinode operational and planning information and guidelines: no change,
  see URL http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/operations/SPWG/spwg-20080118.html
  and http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/soc/JOPs/jop-submit.html

* STEREO operational and planning information: no change, see URL
  http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/operations/SPWG/spwg-20080118.html

* The SOHO JOP/ICAL database and the web pages are now the Solar JOP/ICAL
  database and web pages. This is due to anticipated increased
  contributions by and collaborations as well as intercalibrations with
  STEREO and Hinode.

* New JOP vs. modified existing JOP rules-of-thumb: no change, see URL
  http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/operations/SPWG/spwg-20080118.html

* SOHO calendar email notifications: no change, see URL
