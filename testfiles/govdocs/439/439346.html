      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">&quot;Our claims are 
        based on that great and immutable truth, the rights of all humanity. For 
        is woman not included in that phrase, 'all men are created...equal'?....Tell 
        us, ye men of the nation...whether woman is not included in that great 
        Declaration of Independence?&quot;<br>
        Ernestine L. Rose to the Fifth National Woman's Rights Convention</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">With Ernestine L. 
        Rose as president, the convention heard reports from various states where 
        petition campaigns were underway. Susan B. Anthony urged fellow activists 
        to petition their legislatures for changed laws. Rejecting a proposal 
        to create a national women's rights newspaper as potentially divisive 
        and expensive, the convention appointed a committee including Elizabeth 
        Cady Stanton to publish tracts and place articles in national newspapers. 
        Debates about tactics reaffirmed the decision of the 1852 Syracuse convention 
        to coordinate local work through a central committee headed by Paulina 
        Wright Davis.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Lucretia Mott and 
        Martha Wright served as officers of the convention; James Mott served 
        on the finance committee. Lucretia Mott's most important role was to debate 
        a friend of William Lloyd Garrison, Henry Grew, whose daughter Mary was 
        on the committee to propose resolutions for the convention's adoption. 
        Their debate over scriptural injunctions against women's rights raged, 
        until Garrison also responded, with a resolution passed by the convention 
        that &quot;whatever any book may teach, the rights of no human being are 
        dependent upon or modified thereby, but are equal, absolute, essential, 
        inalienable in the person of every member of the human family...&quot;</font></p>
