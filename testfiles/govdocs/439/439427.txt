  Description:
    Abstract: The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), in cooperation with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management (MA CZM), is producing detailed geologic maps of the coastal sea floor. Imagery, originally collected by NOAA for charting purposes, provides a fundamental framework for research and management activities along this part of the Massachusetts coastline, shows the composition and terrain of the seabed, and provides information on sediment transport and benthic habitat. Interpretive data layers were derived from multibeam echo-sounder and sidescan-sonar data collected in the vicinity of Woods Hole, a passage between the Elizabeth Islands and Cape Cod, Massachusetts.  In November 2007, bottom photographs, seismic-reflection profiles, and surficial sediment data were acquired as part of a ground-truth reconnaissance survey.
    Purpose: To release a grid of the 1.5-m bathymetry generated from NOAA survey H11077 in Woods Hole,  Massachusetts in a geographic coordinate system.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: The multibeam data were acquired in XTF (extended Triton data format) and recorded digitally through an ISIS data acquisition system. A Reson 8101 echosounder hull-mounted on a 29' launch deployed from the NOAA ship Whiting was used to acquire the sounding data. These data were processed using CARIS HIPS (Hydrographic Image Processing System) software for quality control, and to incorporate sound velocity and tidal corrections. Sound velocity corrections were derived using frequent SEACAT CTD (conductivity-temperature-depth) profiles. Typically, a CTD cast was conducted every four to six hours of multibeam acquisition. Tidal zone corrections were calculated from data acquired at the Nantucket tidal gauge. The vertical resolution of the multibeam data is approximately 0.5% of the water depth. The data were gridded to 0.5-m resolution and exported in text (.txt) format. Vertical datum is mean lower low water; X and Y units are meters; UTM Zone 19, NAD83.
