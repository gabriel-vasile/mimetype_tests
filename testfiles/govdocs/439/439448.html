	         <li> <strong>Observed effects:</strong>: amelia (absence of the limbs) or various degrees of phocomelia (reduction of the long bones of the limbs), usually affecting the arms more than the legs and usually involving both the left and right sides, although to differing degress. Congenital heart disease; ocular, intestinal, and renal anomalies; and malformations of the external ears were also involved, but the limb defects were the characteristic effect.

	         <li> ... The pharmacokinetics and hemodynamic effects of two oral doses of thalidomide (100 and 200 mg) were investigated, using a randomized two period crossover design, in a group of asymptomatic male HIV seropositive subjects. Significant dose /related/ decr in supine systolic and diastolic blood pressures were seen up to 2 hr postdosing; somnolence, headache, dizziness and confusion were also reported more frequently at the higher dose of thalidomide. ...

	         <li> A multicenter double blind randomized placebo controlled clinical trial was /initiated/ to determine the safety and efficacy of thalidomide for treating esophageal apthous ulceration in persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Twenty-four HIV infected patients with biopsy confirmed apthous ulceration of the esophagus were randomly assigned to receive either oral thalidomide 200 mg/day or oral placebo daily for 4 wk. ... Adverse events among patients receiving thalidomide included somnolence (4 patients), rash (2 patients) and peripheral sensory neuropathy (3 patients). ... [Jacobson JM, et al; J Infect Dis 180 (1): 61-7 (1999)]**PEER REVIEWED**<br> </li>
	         <li> Toxic epidermal necrolysis is associated with a 30% death rate. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of toxic epidermal necrosis. Thalidomide is a potent inhibitor of TNF-alpha action. ... Excess mortality in the thalidomide group - 10 of 12 patients died compared with three of 10 in the placebo group (Fisher's exact test with Katz's approx, relative risk = 2.78, p+ 0.03). After adjustment for simplified acute physiology score, mortality remained significantly higher in the thalidomide group than in the placebo group (exact logistic regression mid p= 0.007; 95% CI for odds ratio 2.7 to infinity). Plasma TNF-alpha concn was higher in the thalidomide group than the placebo group on day 2, though the difference was not significant. ... Thalidomide is detremental in toxic epidermal necrolysis, possibly because of a paradoxical enhancement of TNF-alpha production. [Wolkenstein P, et al; Lancet 352 (9140): 1586-9 (1998)]**PEER REVIEWED**<br> </li>
	         <li> Thalidomide was admin as a therapeutic agent for chronic graft versus host disease after allogenic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation in a patient with breast cancer. ... /This patient developed preoral neuropathy/ associated with the thalidomide treatment.

	         <li> Thalidomide causes congenital anomalies and it is immunomodulatory. These /events/ can be explained by an ability to alter the orderly process of programmed cell death during embryogenesis and modulation of apoptosis of lymphoid and/or myleoid cells in the immune response. Apoptosis of lymphoid or myleoid cells was studied by measuring the percentage of cells capable of excluding propidium iodide and expressing phosphatidylserine on their outer membrane. In addition, expression of Fc gamma RIII (CD16) was used to assess neutrophil apoptosis. Thalidomide did not affect the rate of apoptosis of CTLL-2 cells deprived of, or supplemented with IL-2; of T cells (mitogen stimulated or resting) or of neutrophils. ... Neutrophils obtained from HIV infected patients treated with thalidomide showed reduced expression of CD16 a surrogate marker for apoptosis of neutrophils. [Aseffa A, et al; Immunopharmacol Immunotox 19 (3): 313-26 (1997)]**PEER REVIEWED**<br> </li>
	         <li> ... Thalidomide was not clastogenic to cultured human lymphocytes (whole blood cultures, minus S-9 mix). ... No cytotoxicity was observed in purified human lymphocytes when exposed to thalidomide up to the limit of its solubility in the medium in the presence or absence of liver S-9 mix from Aroclor induced pregnant rabbit. ... Unusual chromosome morphologies ... not evident in the human lymphocyte micronucleus assay. ... [Ashby J, et al; Mutat Res 396 (1-2): 45-64 (1997)]**PEER REVIEWED**<br> </li>
	         <li> Radiological analysis of limbs of children with thalidomide deformities /exhibited/ changes in the joints analogous to the classical radiological signs of adult neuropathic (Charcot's) joints, and on this /observation/ ... a hypothesis of embryonic sensory peripheral neuropathy is suggested as the mechanism of thalidomide deformities. ... [McCredie J; Lancet 2: 1056-61 (1973)]**PEER REVIEWED**<br> </li>
	         <li> Thalidomide may cause potentially severe nerve damage (polyneuritis or peripheral neuropathy) that may be irreversible. The incidence of peripheral neuropathy in patients receiving thalidomide has been reported to range from less than 1% to more than 70%. ...Clinical symptoms of thalidomide induced neuropathy include ... symmetric painful paresthesia of the hands and feet, often accompanied by sensory loss in the lower limbs. Muscle weakness and cramps, signs of pyramidal tract involvement and carpal tunnel syndrome have been reported. ... An unpleasent pedal symptom, ... tightness around the feet was reported in 8-47% of patients in some studies. ... Thalidomide associated peripheral neuropathies were characterized mostly by sensory symptoms, including hypoesthesia, hyperesthesia, hyperalgesia, impaired temperature sensitivity and impaired ... autonomic nervous functions. These symptoms occasionally were accompanied by mild proximal muscle weakness or evidence of pyramidal tract damage. ... Thalidomide polyneuropathy is characterized by axonal degeneration without demylenization. ... [McEvoy, G.K. (ed.). American Hospital Formulary Service -  Drug Information 1999.

	         <li> In rabbits, administration of thalidomide during pregnancy has caused deformities of the limbs like those in human beings, and caused histologic abnormalities of extraocular muscles in about one third of the fetuses. [Grant, W.M. Toxicology of the Eye. 3rd ed. Springfield, IL: Charles C. Thomas Publisher, 1986., p. 896]**PEER REVIEWED**<br> </li>
	         <li> ... The most common findings in ... rabbits and monkeys /after thalidomide use/ was spontaneous abortion and fetal/neonatal death followed by malformations and then growth retardation. In the rat, prenatal death, growth retardation, and then malformations constituted the typical pattern. [Klaassen, C.D., M.O. Amdur, Doull J. (eds.). Casarett and Doull's Toxicology.

	         <li> ... No injury to cat embryos was produced by a maternal dosage of 500 mg/kg/day, indicating a difference of more than 1000-fold /when compared to humans/. In fact, all other species studied require a dosage greater than that which is teratogenic in some women. The rabbit responds rather uniformly to dosages of 30-50 mg/kg/day, whereas many strains of rat fail to respond to 4000 mg/kg/day even though a dosage of 50 mg/kg/day is teratogenic in a few strains. [Hayes, W.J., Jr., E.R. Laws Jr., (eds.). Handbook of Pesticide Toxicology Volume 1. General Principles. New York, NY: Academic Press, Inc., 1991., p. 76]**PEER REVIEWED**<br> </li>
	         <li> ... Chromatographic analysis and quantative determination of the isolated phospholipid classes revealed statistically significant alterations of the phospholipid fractions in /female Wistar rat/ liver of animals treated with thalidomide dose of 3 mg/kg/day. These alterations may be associated with changes in the metabolic activity, ionic transport and cell-cell interactions of the hepatic cellular components. [Kalofoutis A, et al; Skin Pharm & Skin Appl Physiol 12 (6): 312-6 (1999)]**PEER REVIEWED**<br> </li>
	         <li> Thalidomide was evaluated for its in vitro activity against Encephalitozoon sp. by using the MRC-5 cell system. A cytotoxic effect was observed for concn of 10(1) ug/ml (P<10(5)) and 5 ug/ml (<P10 (5)). Thalidomide did not significantly inhibit the growth of any microsporidia under study. These data /indicate/ that thalidomide is not an etiologic agent treatment in microsporidial enteritis. [Ridoux O, Drancourt M; Antimicrobial Agents & Chemother 43 (9): 2305-6 (1999)]**PEER REVIEWED**<br> </li>
	         <li> ... Thalidomide ... /was studied for/ possible mutagenicity and carcinogenicity. ... The structures of these chemicals were subjected to structure activity analyses using CASE/MULTICASE models of developmental toxicity, rodent carcinogenicity and mutagenicity in Salmonella. Thalidomide and some of its putative metabolites were predicted to be developmental toxicants, none of them were predicted to be rodent carcinogens. Putative metabolites containing the hydroxamic acid or hydroxylamine moieties were predicted to be mutagens. None of the known metabolites of thalidomide contained these reactive moieties. ... [Zhu X, et al; Mutat Res 425 (1): 153-67 (1999)]**PEER REVIEWED**<br> </li>
	         <li> ... Experimental autoimmune neuritis is a CD4+ T cell mediated demylinating autoimmune disease, which represents an animal model for the study of the immunopathogenesis and immunotherapy of Guillain-Barre syndrome in humans. ... The effect of thalidomide /was examined/ in Lewis rats with experimental autoimmune neuritis, which was induced by immunization with bovine peripheral nerve myelin and complete Freund's adjuvant. Thalidomide prolonged clinical experimental autoimmune neuritis when given at a dose of 200 mg/kg/day by gavage. This clinical effect was associated with incr numbers of inflammatory cells in sciatic nerve sections and elevated number of interferon-gamma mRNA expressing cells among lymph node mononuclear cells from thalidomide treated experimental autoimmune neuritis rats on day 17 postimmunization, at the peak of clinical experimental autoimmune neuritis. The finding that thalidomide prolongs clinical experimental autoimmune neuritis is in agreement with the clinical polyneuropathy reported in patients receiving treatment with thalidomide and limits its clinical usefulness. [Zhu J, et al; Scand J Immunol 48 (4): 397-402 (1998)]**PEER REVIEWED**<br> </li>
	         <li> ... Thalidomide was not mutagenic to 6 strains of Salmonella when tested both in the presence and absence of Aroclor induced rat liver S-9 mix. ... Thalidomide was not clastogenic to cultured ... Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) cells treated in vitro. ... Thalidomide was apparently not reactive to the proteins in mouse skin as it gave negative results in the mouse local lymph node assay for skin sensitizing agents. ... Thalidomide was inactive in bone marrow micronucleus assays conducted using males and females from two strains of mice, and female New Zealand white rabbits. It is concluded that thalidomide is neither a mutagen or aneugen. ... [Ashby J, et al; Mutat Res 396 (1-2): 45-64 (1997)]**PEER REVIEWED**<br> </li>
	         <li> It was postulated that thalidomide causes birth defects by being metabolized to a toxic electrophilic intermediate. ... Maternal hepatic microsomes from pregnant rabbits mediated the production of a metabolite that was toxic to lymphocytes. Toxicity was enhanced by inhibitors of epoxide hydroxylase and abolished by adding the purified enzyme to the incubation medium. The metabolite thus appears to be an arene oxide, consistent with previously reported isolation of phenolic metabolites of thalidomide in the urine of treated animals. ... The toxic metabolite of thalidomide was not produced by rat liver microsomes (the rat is not sensitive to thalidomide teratogenesis) but was produced by hepatic preparations from maternal rabbits, and rabbit, monkey and human (all sensitive species) fetuses. ... [Gordon GB, et al; Proc Nat Acad Sci 78 (4): 2545-8 (1981)]**PEER REVIEWED**<br> </li>
	         <li> Thalidomide /induced/ a remarkable decr of fine granular chromatin in the nucleus, large vacuolization of the cytoplasm and alteration of mitochondria in Tetrahymena pyriformis. The degree of alteration was dose related. Subcultures obtained from animals treated with high doses show a reduction in fine chromatin and mitochondria with tubules less tightly packed when compared with controls. ... Results indicate that the /cmpd/ is mutagenic/. [Garavini C, et al; Biol Chim Farm 118: 563-6 (1979)]**PEER REVIEWED**<br> </li>
	         <li> ... Resorption and the incidence of abnormalities in rats and rabbits were incr by ... thalidomide at 37.5 mg/kg. [Keplinger ML, et al; Toxicol Appl Pharmacol 28: 209-15 (1974)]**PEER REVIEWED**<br> </li>
	         <li> Timed pregnancies were induced in cats by synchronizing gonadotropin stimulated estrus and ovulation with natural mating. The cats were given daily oral doses of thalidomide as follows: 10 mg/kg on days 10-20 of pregnancy, 240 mg/kg on days 10-14 and 120, 240, 480 mg/kg on days 15-17 or 18-20 of pregnancy. Fetuses were delivered by cesarean section on day 44 or 45 or earlier if threatened abortion was considered imminent. A wide variety of cardiovascular anomalies was observed on gross and microscopic examination including ... ventricular septal defect, right atrial distension primarily involving the septal defect, right atrial distension primarily involving the coronary sinus, malpositioned great vessels, and narrowed left ventricular chamber with hypertrophied walls. The overall incidence of these anomalies appeared related to dose and treatment period. [Kernis MM; Teratol 11 (1): 65-9 (1975)]**PEER REVIEWED**<br> </li>
	         <li> Gross malformations of the external, middle and internal ear were /observed/ in fetal monkeys following maternal ingestion of thalidomide. 25 pregnant bonnet monkeys (Macaca radiata) were each given a single oral dose of 10 mg/kg thalidomide day 24, 25, 26, 2, 28, 29 or 30 mg/kg on day 25 or 28 of gestation. ... The skeletons, processed and stained with Alizarin Red S, were examined for changes in configuration and/or ossification of the ossicles and temporal bones. Bilateral temporal bones of one case, treated on day 24 were sectioned at 10 microns and examined histologically. Twelve fetuses were collected at 70 +/- 3 days of gestation showed no gross ear defects, while 10 out of 13 fetuses collected at 100 +/-3 days of gestation had structural anomalies. ... All malformations were severe in fetuses treated on day 24 of gestation and lessened in the degree of severity with treatments on days 25-28. Fetuses treated on day 29 were normal. External ear anomalies included microtia with meatal atresia or stenosis and varying degrees of auricular hypoplasia. Defects of the middle ear were predominantly hypoplasia of the malleus, incus, and tympanic ring. Fused ossicles and cochlear and vestibular window abnormalities were only seen in animals treated on day 24. The internal ear exhibited petrosal hypoplasia and delayed ossification of the lateral aspect of the lateral and posterior semicircular canals. Chochlear, vestibular, semicircular and transcapsular canal defects were confirmed histologically in one case. [Newman LM, Hendrickx AG; Teratol 23 (3): 351-64 (1981)]**PEER REVIEWED**<br> </li>
	         <li> Mouse fetuses were treated /with/ thalidomide on days 11-12 in order to /determine/ whether the drug would induce blood abnormalities leading to circulatory troubles. About 18% of the treated fetuses showed both severe limb hemorrhages on day 14, and obvious alterations of the nucleated red blood cells of vitelline origin. These blood abnormalities, occurring suddenly during the well known critical stage of fetal development could be responsible for circulatory blocks leading to necrosis. [Petter C; Experientia 33 (10): 1384-6 (1977)]**PEER REVIEWED**<br> </li>
	         <li> Focal hemorrhages early in embryogenesis may play a significant /role/ in the pathogenesis of specific malformations. Animal models of hemifacial microsomia and thalidomide induced otomandibular dystosis are described; the causal mechanism of malformation appeared to be closely related to the formation of a hematoma at the time of development of the stapedial arterial systems. ...

	         <li> Thalidomide ... a potent inhibitor of tumor necrosis factor alpha is proving to be a promising drug in the treatment of a number of inflammatory, autoimmune and HIV associated disorders. The pharmacokinetics and hemodynamic effects of two oral doses of thalidomide (100 and 200 mg) were investigated, using a randomized two period crossover design, in a group of asymptomatic male HIV seropositive subjects. Thalidomide pharmacokinetics were linear at the doses studied, and were best described by a one compartment model with first order absorption and elimination processes. The drug was rapidly absorbed with a mean absorption half life of 0.95 hr (range 0.16-2.49 hr) and 1.19 hr (0.33-3.53 hr) after 100 and 200 mg doses, respectively.

	         <li> ... This phase II study examined the pharmacokinetics of thalidomide in patients with clinically progressive hormone refractory prostate cancer. Patients aged 55-80 yr were randomized to two different arms, low dose vs high dose. Patients in the low dose group were given 200 mg of thalidomide and patients in the high dose group received 200 mg thalidomide, with subsequent dose escalations to 1200 mg. Serial serum or blood samples were obtained for pharmacokinetic assessment after admin of a single oral dose or multiple daily dosing of thalidomide and were assayed by reversed phase HPLC. Pharmacokinetic parameters for both the single and multiple dosing were calculated with ADAPT II. A one compartment model best fit the data. After single dosing, the oral clearance and apparent volume of distribution for the low dose regimen (n=13) were 7.41 +/-2.05 l/hr and 66.93 +/-34.27 l/hr, respectively, whereas the high dose regimen (N=11), these values were 7.21 +/-2.89 l/hr and 165.81 +/-84.18 l/hr. Elimination half lives for the low and high dose were 6.52 +/-3.81 hr and 18.25 +/-14.08 hr, respectively.

	         <li> Studies on thalidomide metabolism in humans have not been done. In animals, nonenzymatic hydrolytic cleavage appears to be the main pathway of degradation, producing seven major and at least five minor hydrolysis products. Thalidomide may be metabolized hepatically by the enzymes of the cytochrome p450 enzyme system. Thalidomide does not appear to induce or inhibit its own metabolism. However, it may interfere with enzyme induction caused by other compounds. The end product of metabolism, phthalic acid, is excreted as a glycine conjugate. [USP. Convention.

	         <li> The chiral inversion and hydrolysis of thalidomide and the catalysis by bases and human serum albumin were investigated by /utilizing/ a stereoselective HPLC assay. Chiral inversion was catalyzed by albumin, hydroxyl ions, phosphate and amino acids. Basic amino acids (arginine and lysine) had a superior potency in catalyzing chiral inversion compared to acid and neutral ones. The chiral inversion of thalidomide is thus subject to specific and general base catalysis and it is suggested that the ability of HSA to catalyze the reaction is due to basic groups of the amino acids arginine and lysine and not to a single catalytic site on the macromolecule. The hydrolysis of thalidomide was also base catalyzed. ... Albumin had no effect on hydrolysis and there was no difference between the catalytic potencies of acidic, neutral and base amino acids. ... Chiral inversion is deduced to occur by electrophilic substitution involving specific and general base catalysis, whereas hydrolysis is thought to occur by nucleophilic substitution involving specific and general base as well as nucleophilic catalysis. As nucleophilic attack is sensitive to steric properties of the catalyst, steric hindrance might be the reason albumin is not able to catalyze hydrolysis. (1)H NMR experiments revealed that the three teratogenic metabolites of thalidomide, in sharp contrast to the drug itself had complete chiral stability. This leads to the speculation that, were some enantioselectivity to exist in the teratogenicity of thalidomide, it could result from fast hydrolysis to chirally stable teratogenic metabolites.

	         <li> ... The anti-angiogenic effects of thalidomide may only be observed following the metabolic activation of the cmpd. This activation process may be species specific, similar to the teratogenic properties associated with this /cmpd/. ... Co-incubation of thalidomide in the presence of either human, rabbit or rat liver microsomes /was investigated/. These experiments demonstrated that thalidomide inhibited microvessel formation from rat aortas and slowed human aortic endothelial cell proliferation in the presence of human or rabbit microsomes, but not in the presence of rat microsomes. In the absence of microsomes, thalidomide had no effect on either microvessel formation or cell proliferation, thus demonstrating that a metabolite of thalidomide is responsible for its anti-angiogenic effects and that this metabolite can be formed in both humans and rabbits, but not in rodents.
