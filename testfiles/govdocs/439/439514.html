<p><center>Decided: September 22, 1998</center>


<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>			We are affirming the orders entered by the ICC in these
proceedings in its decisions served in 1988, affirming
in one case (4 I.C.C.2d 1080) and affirming in part and
reversing in part in the other (4 I.C.C.2d 641) the
arbitration awards previously entered in these
proceedings in accordance with Article I, section 4 of
the <u>New York Dock</u> conditions.  <u>New&nbsp;York Dock Ry.--
Control--Brooklyn Eastern Dist.</u>, 360&nbsp;I.C.C.&nbsp;60, 84-90
(1979) (<u>New&nbsp;York Dock</u>).  We do so employing the reasons
and the standards set forth in the ICC's subsequent
1990 decision in this matter served on June 21, 1990 (6
I.C.C.2d 715).  However, we are not remanding the
matters to the parties for further negotiation as that
decision proposed to do because developments in the law
since then have made it unnecessary to do so and
because the parties have waited long enough for a final
resolution of these proceedings.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>		We answer the question left open by the Supreme Court
decision in <u>Norfolk &amp; Western R. Co. v. Train
Dispatchers</u>, 499 U.S. 117, 134 (1991) (<u>N&amp;W</u>), as
follows: Where <u>New York Dock</u> labor protection is
required to be imposed upon a rail consolidation by
virtue of 49 U.S.C. 11347, now section 11326, the scope
of an arbitrator's authority to modify collective
bargaining agreements (CBAs) as "necessary ... to carry
out the transaction" under section 11341(a), now
section 11321(a), is limited by the provisions of these
labor protective conditions as explained by the ICC in
its 1990 decision and as updated and further explained
in this decision.  We conclude that it is unnecessary,
premature and inappropriate for us to address in the
abstract at this time the reach of the immunity
provision of section 11341(a), now section 11321(a),
where it is not constrained by the required imposition
of <u>New York Dock</u> labor conditions.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong><a name="_1_2"></a>Finance Docket No. 28905 (Sub-No. 22).</strong>  In <u>CSX Corp.--
Control--Chessie and Seaboard C.L.I.</u>, 363 I.C.C. 518 (1980)
(<u>CSX&nbsp;Control</u>), the ICC approved, subject to the <u>New York Dock</u>
conditions, the control by CSX Corporation of two noncarrier
railroad holding companies, the Chessie System, Inc. (Chessie)
and Seaboard Coast Line Industries, Inc. (SCLI).  The railroads
controlled by Chessie included the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway
Company (C&amp;O).  The railroads controlled by SCLI included the
Seaboard Coast Line Railroad Company (SCL).<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	In 1980, when the ICC approved the <u>CSX Control</u> transaction,
C&amp;O operated a freight car heavy repair shop at Raceland, KY, and
SCL operated a freight car heavy repair shop at Waycross, GA. 
These two shops continued to function for the next several years. 
The Raceland shop continued to perform freight car heavy repair
work for C&amp;O, and the Waycross shop continued to perform freight
car heavy repair work for SCL and, after a time, for SCL's
corporate successor, an entity first known as Seaboard System
Railroad, Inc. and later known as CSX Transportation, Inc.
(CSXT).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	In August 1986, C&amp;O and CSXT (hereinafter referred to
collectively as CSX) served notice under <u>New York Dock</u>,
Article&nbsp;I, section 4, on BRC and other involved unions that, on
or about December 31, 1986, the Waycross freight car heavy repair
shop would be closed and its functions would be transferred to
the Raceland freight car heavy repair shop.  The notice stated
that the work to be moved from Waycross to Raceland, which was
then being performed at Waycross under the SCL Agreement, would
be "coordinated with such work presently being performed at
Raceland under the C&amp;O Agreement."  The notice indicated that
149&nbsp;positions (121 of which were represented by BRC) would be
abolished at Waycross, and that 107 positions (99 of which would
be represented by BRC) would be established at Raceland.  CSX and
BRC attempted to negotiate regarding the proposed transfer, but
were unable to reach agreement.  The matter was then submitted to
arbitration.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	On March 23, 1987, the arbitration committee entered its
opinion and award (<u>LaRocco Award</u>).  The committee, relying
heavily upon the ICC's 1983 <u>DRGW</u> decision,<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> determined that,
under Article&nbsp;I, section 4 of the <u>New York Dock</u> conditions, it
had jurisdiction to formulate an implementing agreement, and
that, pursuant to 49&nbsp;U.S.C. 11341(a), the implementing agreement
would be immunized from conflicting provisions in the Railway
Labor Act (RLA) and in existing CBAs.  The committee further
determined, however, that, on account of the section 11341(a)
"necessity" requirement, such an implementing agreement had to
"reasonably accommodate" existing CBAs and collective bargaining
rights.<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a>  The "reasonable accommodation" formula attained
particular significance on account of the committee's finding
that the Orange Book, in explicitly according SCL the right to
transfer Orange Book protected employees and their work
throughout the SCL system, implicitly barred SCL and its
successors from transferring Orange&nbsp;Book protected employees or
their work beyond the SCL system.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	The implementing agreement that the committee formulated
reflected what it considered to be a "reasonable accommodation"
of the section 11341(a) immunity provision with the Orange Book
agreement.  Acknowledging section 11341(a), the committee
concluded that the Orange Book provision barring the transfer of
<em>the work</em> of covered employees beyond the former SCL system "must
be subordinated to the Carriers' right to engage in the
authorized <u>New York Dock</u> transaction.  Otherwise, the Carriers
would be effectively thwarted from transferring all the Waycross
freight car heavy repair work to Raceland."  <u>LaRocco Award</u>, at
36-37.  But, reflecting its "reasonable accommodation" standard,
the committee ruled that the Orange Book provision barring the
transfer of <em>covered employees</em> beyond the former SCL system would
not be thus subordinated.  "Unlike the work, the Orange Book
limitation on transferring covered employees throughout the SCL
system can be reasonably accommodated with the transaction. 
Permitting Orange Book covered workers to be transferred only
throughout the SCL (absent a voluntary agreement with the
Organization) will only slightly impair the transaction while
preserving the essence of the Orange Book pursuant to Section 3
of the <u>New York Dock</u> conditions."  <u>LaRocco Award</u>, at 37.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Accordingly, the committee, in formulating an implementing
agreement, directed the parties to adopt the implementing
agreement that had been proposed by CSX, subject to this one
significant exception:  that Waycross employees covered by the
Orange Book could not be compelled to transfer to Raceland.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	In <u>CSX Corp.--Control--Chessie and Seaboard C.L.I.</u>,
4&nbsp;I.C.C.2d 641 (1988) (<u>Carmen I</u>), the ICC affirmed in part and
reversed in part the committee's opinion and award, and remanded
to the committee for further proceedings consistent with the
ICC's decision.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	The ICC affirmed the part of the committee's opinion and
award that approved the movement of the work performed at
Waycross.  The ICC noted that the committee had concluded that
"it had the authority to move both work and employees to
Raceland, despite potentially conflicting provisions in the RLA
and the Orange Book Agreement ('the ICC has emphasized that a
transaction hurdles all legal obstacles preventing
implementation,' award at 34).  This is a correct statement of
our position and we affirm the committee's finding on its
authority."  <u>Carmen I</u>, 4 I.C.C.2d at 649.  The ICC restated the
applicable standard as follows:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>		[T]he carrier is permitted to carry out and fully
implement [a transaction the Commission has
authorized] despite potential impediments in
existing agreements upon compliance with the
provisions for the protection of the rights of
employees contained in <u>New York Dock</u> or imposed by
the Commission upon the involved transaction.  As
the committee found, and we agree, it has the
authority to override these obstacles in the
implementing agreement it will fashion.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><u>Carmen&nbsp;I</u>, 4 I.C.C.2d at 650.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	The ICC reversed the part of the committee's opinion and
award that created an Orange Book employees exception to the
prescribed implementing agreement.  The ICC ruled that the
committee had erred in fashioning a standard of "slight
impairment of the transaction" for permitting a CBA provision to
conflict with the implementation of an approved transaction. 
This "slight impairment of the transaction" standard, the ICC
stated, contradicted the correct standard ("a transaction hurdles
all legal obstacles preventing implementation"), and would
effectively undercut the ICC's authorization of the transaction
at issue.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>		[E]ven if the committee did properly interpret the
Orange Book as prohibiting the transfer of
employees outside former SCL limits, its attempted
"accommodation" of this supposed prohibition to
the proposed transaction must be overturned
because the Orange Book agreement as interpreted
by the committee serves as an impediment to
implementation of a transaction authorized by the
Commission.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><u>Carmen I</u>, 4 I.C.C.2d at 649-50.  The ICC added that, even if the
committee's "slight impairment of the transaction" standard were
appropriate, the evidence of record did not support the
application of that standard in the present circumstances.  The
evidence, the ICC said, established that a prohibition against
the transfer of Orange Book protected employees "imposed a
significant, if not insurmountable, obstacle to implementation of
the transfer."  <u>Carmen I</u>, 4 I.C.C.2d at 649.  Accordingly, the
ICC set aside the portion of the decision holding that CSX may
not require transfer of employees and remanded the matter with
the instruction that such transfers are of course subject to the
terms set forth in <u>New York Dock</u> for the protection of the
interests of affected employees.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong><a name="_1_3"></a>Finance Docket No. 29430 (Sub-No. 20).</strong>  In <u>Norfolk Southern
Corp.--Control--Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. Co.</u>, 366 I.C.C. 171 (1982)
(<u>NS&nbsp;Control</u>), the ICC authorized Norfolk Southern Corporation to
acquire control of the separate railroad systems of Norfolk and
Western Railway Company (N&amp;W) and Southern Railway Company
(Southern).  The approval was subject to the <u>New&nbsp;York Dock</u>
conditions.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	In 1982, when the ICC approved the <u>NS Control</u> transaction,
each railroad system performed its own power distribution work. 
On the N&amp;W, power distribution was performed at an N&amp;W facility
in Roanoke, VA, by supervisors who were represented by the
American Train Dispatchers Association (ATDA), and who were
covered by an ATDA/N&amp;W CBA.  On the Southern, power distribution
was performed at a Southern facility in Atlanta, GA, by
supervisors who were considered management, and who, for this
reason, were neither represented by a union nor covered by a CBA.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	In September 1986, N&amp;W and Southern (hereinafter referred to
collectively as NS) notified ATDA that power distribution for the
two railroad systems would be consolidated.  This consolidation
would involve the transfer of the work performed in the N&amp;W's
Roanoke facility to the Southern's Atlanta facility, which would
thereafter be responsible for power distribution for the entire
NS system.  It was envisioned that the work at the Atlanta
facility would be performed by Southern supervisors, and
therefore would not be subject to a CBA.  In a proposed
implementing agreement, NS offered the N&amp;W supervisors the
opportunity to request consideration for new supervisor positions
to be created on the Southern.  NS was unwilling, however, to
assign the transferred N&amp;W supervisors the same duties and
territorial responsibilities they had had on the N&amp;W.  NS and
ATDA attempted to negotiate regarding the proposed consolidation,
but they were unable to reach agreement.  The matter was then
submitted to arbitration.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	On May 19, 1987, the arbitration committee entered its
decision and award (<u>Harris Award</u>).  The committee, relying
heavily upon the ICC's 1985 <u>Maine Central</u> decision,<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a> determined,
in essence, that, under Article I, section 4 of the <u>New York Dock</u>
conditions, it had jurisdiction to formulate an implementing
agreement, and that, pursuant to section 11341(a), the
implementing agreement would be immunized from conflicting
provisions in existing CBAs and in the RLA.  The committee also
ruled that Article I, section 4 of the <u>New York Dock</u> conditions
empowered it to approve the transfer of work from a location
subject to a CBA to a location not subject to a CBA. 
Accordingly, the committee adopted, with one minor exception, the
implementing agreement that had been proposed by NS.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	In <u>Norfolk Southern Corp.--Control--Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. Co.</u>,
4&nbsp;I.C.C.2d 1080 (1988) (<u>Dispatchers I</u>), the ICC affirmed the
committee's decision and award.  The ICC said that, under the
auspices of the section 11341(a) exemption, the mandatory
arbitration scheme of Article I, section&nbsp;4 of <u>New York Dock</u> took
precedence over RLA procedures whether asserted independently or
based on an existing CBA.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>		Article I, section 4 of <u>New York Dock</u> provides for
compulsory, binding arbitration of disputes.  It
has long been the ICC's view that private
collective bargaining agreements and RLA
provisions must give way to the ICC-mandated
procedures of section 4 when parties are unable to
agree on changes in working conditions required to
implement a transaction authorized by the
Commission.  Absent such a resolution, the intent
of Congress that Commission-authorized
transactions be consummated and fully implemented
might never be realized.  Moreover, 49 U.S.C.
&#167;&nbsp;11341(a) exempts from other law a carrier
participating in a &#167; 11343 transaction as
necessary to carry out the transaction.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong><a name="_1_4"></a>At The Court Of Appeals.</strong>  In <u>Brotherhood of Ry. Carmen v.
ICC</u>, 880 F.2d 562 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (<u>Carmen</u>), the court of
appeals, ruling that the section 11341(a) immunity provision did
not empower the ICC to override a CBA, reversed the ICC's
decisions in <u>Carmen I</u> and <u>Dispatchers I</u> and remanded the records
to the ICC in order that the ICC might determine whether further
proceedings were necessary.  The ICC accepted the remand, and, on
June 21, 1990, it served its decision on remand, <u>CSX&nbsp;Corp.--
Control--Chessie and Seaboard C.L.I.</u>, 6 I.C.C.2d 715 (1990)
(<u>Carmen II</u>).  CSX and NS, however, did not agree with the
decision of the court of appeals; instead, they sought
certiorari; and, on March 19, 1991, the Supreme Court issued its
decision on certiorari, reversing the D.C. Circuit.  <u>Norfolk &amp;
Western R. Co. v. Train Dispatchers</u>, 499&nbsp;U.S. 117 (1991) (<u>N&amp;W</u>).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong><a name="_1_5"></a>On Remand.</strong>  In the interim the ICC issued <u>Carmen II</u>, which
held that, in connection with an approved transaction, CBAs and
collective bargaining rights could be modified, without resort to
RLA procedures, under the auspices of section 11347 and the
protective conditions imposed thereunder.  Thus, according to the
ICC's decision, the CBA override authority that the court of
appeals had held could not be based on section 11341(a) has a
basis in section 11347 and Article I, section 4 of the <u>New York
Dock</u> labor conditions.  Section 11341(a) was found available to
be relied upon for an RLA override authority commensurate with
the changes in CBAs that could be effected under section 11347.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	The <u>Carmen II</u> analysis is based upon the historical
development of section 11347 and ICC labor conditions.  The
history behind this provision, leading to its enactment in 1940
as section 5(2)(f), is long and complex, and involves the
Transportation Act of 1920, the Railway Labor Act of 1926, the
Emergency Railroad Transportation Act of 1933, certain amendments
to the Railway Labor Act enacted in 1934, the Washington Job
Protection Agreement of 1936 (WJPA), and the Transportation Act
of 1940.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	The ICC indicated in <u>Carmen II</u> that the enactment of section
5(2)(f) in the Transportation Act of 1940 codified the legal
framework that had been agreed upon by the negotiators of the
WJPA in 1936, and set the stage for a 40-year era of labor peace
with regard to mergers and consolidations.  Upon approving a
post-1940 merger or consolidation proposed by two or more
railroads, the ICC would impose WJPA-based protective conditions. 
Rail management and rail labor would then negotiate implementing
agreements to permit smooth implementation of the transaction,
and, in the event of impasse, arbitrators were empowered to
modify CBAs when necessary to implement the transaction.  Prior
to 1936, these negotiations would have been conducted under the
interminable RLA dispute resolution procedures applicable to
major disputes, and deadlock might well have been the result. 
After 1940, the mechanism for an RLA bypass having been put in
place, these negotiations would have been conducted under the
WJPA, under comparable procedures negotiated in connection with
the particular transaction, or under the comparable section
5(2)(f)-mandated procedures contained in the ICC's labor
conditions.  These various procedures, all of which were
substantially the same and provided for mandatory binding
arbitration, were designed to resolve covered disputes with a
certain measure of dispatch and to overcome the obstacle of CBA
provisions that might otherwise have prevented consummation of an
approved transaction.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<u>Carmen II</u> indicates that the 40-year era of labor peace
ushered in by the 1940 enactment of section 5(2)(f) ended about
1980 arguably due in part to a change mandated by the Railroad
Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976:  the addition
of the requirement that the ICC impose labor protection at least
as protective of the interests of employees as the terms
established under section 405 of the Rail Passenger Service Act
(RPSA).  This gave birth to Article I, section 2 of the <u>New York
Dock</u> conditions which provide for the preservation of collective
bargaining rights.  Rail labor contended for a literal reading of
Article I, section 2 so as to prevent any modifications of CBA
provisions in approved consolidations except through resort to
RLA procedures.<a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a>  The carriers, on the other hand, responded with
a reading of Article I, section 4 of the <u>New York Dock</u> conditions
which would permit an arbitrator to change any provision of a CBA
deemed an impediment to the approved consolidation.  In <u>Carmen I</u>
and <u>Dispatchers I</u>, the ICC applied the interpretation of Article
I, section 4 of <u>New York Dock</u> and the section 11341(a) immunity
provision commonly associated with its 1983 <u>DRGW</u> decision and its
1985 <u>Maine Central</u> decision (hereinafter referred to collectively
as the <u>DRGW</u> doctrine).  The <u>DRGW</u> doctrine asserted that, as a
result of section 11341(a), the ICC approval of a transaction
operated automatically to override all laws, including the RLA,
as necessary to carry out an approved transaction, and that CBAs
conflicting with an approved transaction had to give way.  Under
the <u>DRGW</u> doctrine, it was understood that the Article I,
section&nbsp;4 binding arbitration rule trumped the Article I,
section&nbsp;2 "preservation of contracts" rule.  It was further
understood that, by virtue of section 11341(a), a <u>New York Dock</u>
arbitrator acting under Article I, section 4 was authorized to
override any term of a CBA that impeded the effectuation of a
merger.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	In <u>Carmen II</u> the ICC made three refinements to the <u>DRGW</u>
doctrine.  <em>First</em>, the ICC substituted section 11347, which
provides for the imposition of labor protective conditions in
connection with an approved transaction, for section 11341(a) as
the authority for modifying CBAs while foreclosing resort to RLA
remedies.  <em>Second</em>, the ICC set forth a more balanced
interpretation of Article I, section 2 of <u>New York Dock</u>.  Article
I, section 2, the ICC indicated, cannot realistically be
interpreted as bearing its literal meaning, i.e., that CBAs shall
be preserved without any qualification whatsoever.  What
Article&nbsp;I, section 2 means, the ICC found, is that contract
rights shall be respected and not overridden unless necessary to
permit an approved transaction to proceed.<a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a>  <em>Third</em>, the ICC
tempered what it had said in <u>DRGW</u> and <u>Maine Central</u>.  It was
still true, the ICC stated in <u>Carmen II</u>, that CBAs and the RLA
had to yield to allow implementation of an approved transaction. 
However, section 11347, and the protective conditions imposed
thereunder, only required CBAs and the RLA to yield to permit
modifications of the type traditionally made by arbitrators under
the WJPA and the ICC's conditions from 1940 to 1980; and section
11341(a) reinforced 11347 by requiring the RLA to yield so as not
to block the sort of changes permitted under section 11347.  The
ICC did not attempt to define what changes should be considered
to be necessary but stated in <u>Carmen II</u> that CBAs and the RLA
should not be overridden simply to facilitate a transaction, but
should be required to yield only when and to the extent necessary
to permit the approved transaction to proceed.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	The ICC did not attempt, in <u>Carmen II</u>, to apply its section
11347 analysis to the facts of the two proceedings then before
the ICC (and now before the Board).  Rather, in recognition of
the central role accorded negotiation and arbitration in the
fashioning of an implementing agreement, these two proceedings
were "remanded to the parties to continue the implementing
process in accordance with Article I, section 4 of the <u>New York
Dock</u> conditions through further negotiations or arbitration, if
necessary, to reach new implementing agreements in accordance
with the standards set forth in this decision."  <u>Carmen II</u>,
6&nbsp;I.C.C.2d at 757.  The two outstanding arbitration awards were
vacated, because the arbitrators in the two cases had "based
their decisions on pronouncements [in <u>DRGW</u> and <u>Maine Central]</u>
that the <em><u>Carmen</u></em> court found to be incorrect statements of the law
and that we modify in this decision," <u>Carmen II</u>, 6 I.C.C.2d

<p>	<strong><a name="_1_6"></a>At The Supreme Court.</strong>  In <u>N&amp;W</u> the Supreme Court, holding
that a carrier's exemption under section 11341(a) "from all other
law" includes the carrier's legal obligations under a CBA,
reversed the D.C. Circuit's <u>Carmen</u> judgment and remanded for
further proceedings.  The Supreme Court's <u>N&amp;W</u> decision amounted
to an affirmation of a key aspect of the ICC's decisions in <u>DRGW</u>,
<u>Maine Central</u>, <u>Carmen I</u>, and <u>Dispatchers I</u>.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>		     We hold that, as necessary to carry out a
transaction approved by the ICC, the term "all
other law" in &#167; 11341(a) includes any obstacle
imposed by law.  In this case, the term "all other
law" in &#167; 11341(a) applies to the substantive and
remedial laws respecting enforcement of
collective-bargaining agreements.  Our
construction of the clear statutory command
confirms the interpretation of the agency charged
with its administration and expert in the field of
railroad mergers.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">

emphasized that its decision did not resolve certain issues:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>		     By its terms, the exemption applies only when
<em>necessary</em> to carry out an <em>approved</em> transaction. 
These predicates, however, are not at issue here,
for the Court of Appeals did not pass on them and
the parties do not challenge them.  For purposes
of this decision, we assume, without deciding,
that the ICC properly considered the public
interest factors of &#167; 11344(b)(1) in approving the
original transaction, that its decision to
override the carriers' obligations is consistent
with the labor protective requirements of &#167; 11347,
and that the override was necessary to the
implementation of the transaction within the
meaning of &#167; 11341(a).  Under these assumptions,
we hold that the exemption from "all other law" in
&#167; 11341(a) includes the obligations imposed by the
terms of a collective-bargaining agreement.

<p><center><strong><a name="_1_11"></a>Analytical Framework</strong></center>


<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong><a name="_1_12"></a>United States Code.</strong>  The analytical framework within which
these proceedings arose and under which they must be decided
rests primarily upon 49 U.S.C. 11343, 11344, 11347, and 11341.<a href="#N_13_"><sup>(13)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Section 11343(a) provided that certain rail carrier control
"transactions" could be carried out only with the approval and
authorization of the ICC.  The control by CSX Corporation of the
Chessie holding company (which itself controlled several rail
carriers) and the SCLI holding company (which itself controlled
several additional rail carriers) was a "transaction" within the
scope of 49 U.S.C. 11343(a).  The control by Norfolk Southern
Corporation of rail carriers N&amp;W and Southern was likewise a
"transaction" within the scope of 49&nbsp;U.S.C. 11343(a).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Section 11344(a) provided that the ICC could begin a
proceeding to approve and authorize a transaction referred to in
49 U.S.C. 11343 on application of the person seeking that
authority.  Section 11344(c) directed the ICC to approve and
authorize any such transaction when it found that the transaction
was consistent with the public interest.  Section 11344(b)(1)(D)
provided that, if the transaction involved the merger or control
of at least two Class I railroads, the ICC, in reaching its
decision under section 11344(c), would first have to consider
several factors including, among others, "the interest of carrier
employees affected by the proposed transaction."  Applications
seeking approval for the <u>CSX&nbsp;Control</u> transaction and the <u>NS
Control</u> transaction were filed with the ICC by CSX Corporation
and NS Corporation, respectively; the ICC approved such
transactions upon finding that each was consistent with the
public interest, <u>CSX&nbsp;Control</u>, 363 I.C.C. at 597-98, and <u>NS
Control</u>, 366 I.C.C. at 249; and, because each such transaction
involved the control of at least two Class I railroads, the ICC
considered, with respect to each transaction, the interests of
the carrier employees affected by the proposed transaction,
<u>CSX&nbsp;Control</u>, 363&nbsp;I.C.C. at 588-92, and <u>NS Control</u>, 366 I.C.C. at
229-31.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Section 11347 directed the ICC, when approving a rail
carrier transaction under 49 U.S.C. 11344, to require the rail
carrier to provide a fair arrangement at least as protective of
the interests of employees who were affected by the transaction
as "the terms imposed under this section before February 5, 1976,
and the terms established under section 565 of title 45."  In
response to the addition, in 1976, of the reference to the terms
established under section 565 of title 45 (i.e., the terms
established under section 405 of the RPSA), the ICC developed the
<u>New York Dock</u><a href="#N_14_"><sup>(14)</sup></a> conditions which were imposed upon the primary
transactions at issue in <u>CSX&nbsp;Control</u> and <u>NS Control</u>.  <u>CSX
Control</u>, 363 I.C.C. at 604; <u>NS Control</u>, 366&nbsp;I.C.C. at 253.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Section 11341(a) provided that a carrier, corporation, or
person participating in a transaction approved by the ICC under
49 U.S.C. 11344 was "exempt from the antitrust laws <em>and from all
other law</em>, including State and municipal law, as necessary to let
that person carry out the transaction, hold, maintain, and
operate property, and exercise control or franchises acquired
through the transaction" (emphasis added).  Section 11341(a) was
variously referred to as the immunity provision, the exemption
provision, and the override provision (because it "immunized" a
rail carrier from laws that might otherwise have been applicable,
it "exempted" that carrier from the requirements of such laws,
and it effected an "override" of such laws).  In the 1991 <u>N&amp;W</u>
decision, the Supreme Court held that the immunity provision
reached <em>both</em> the Railway Labor Act itself (because the RLA was a
"law") <em>and also</em> CBAs entered into under the RLA (because immunity
from a law implies immunity from the obligations imposed by that
law).  <u>N&amp;W</u>, 499 U.S. at 133.  The Court noted, however, that such
immunity would apply only when <em>necessary</em> to carry out a properly
<em>approved transaction</em>, and the Court emphasized "that neither the
conditions of approval, nor the standard for necessity, is before
us today."  <u>N&amp;W</u>, 499 U.S. at 134.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong><a name="_1_13"></a><u>New York Dock</u>.</strong>  The basic framework <em>both</em> for mitigating the
labor impacts of consolidations <em>and also</em> for bypassing the drawn-out RLA procedures that would otherwise be applicable to
particular transactions was created in the Washington Job
Protection Agreement of 1936, was enacted into law by the
Transportation Act of 1940,<a href="#N_15_"><sup>(15)</sup></a> and was carried into its present
form in 1979 when the ICC issued the <u>New York Dock</u> conditions. 
That framework provides <em>both</em> substantive benefits for affected
employees (dismissal allowances, displacement allowances, and the
like) <em>and</em> a procedural mechanism (negotiation, if possible;
arbitration, if necessary) for resolving disputes respecting
implementation of authorized transactions.  <u>See</u> <u>New York Dock</u>,
360 I.C.C. at 84-90.<a href="#N_16_"><sup>(16)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Most recently the Board affirmed the importance it places on
negotiation first, and arbitration, if necessary, to arrive at
implementing agreements in its recent decision in <u>CSX Corporation

the request of various organizations representing employees, it
expressly stated that "approval of this transaction does not
indicate approval or disapproval of any of the CBA overrides that
applicants have argued are necessary to carry out the
transaction; the arbitrators are free to make whatever findings
and conclusions they deem appropriate with respect to CBA
overrides under the law."

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Arbitration plays a central role in the process of
implementing approved transactions under <u>New York Dock</u>.  The
<u>New&nbsp;York Dock</u> conditions do not prescribe, and they could not
possibly prescribe, a one-size-fits-all standard respecting
implementation of particular transactions.  Instead, <u>New York
Dock</u> prescribes a procedure (negotiation, if possible;
arbitration, if necessary) for arriving at an implementing
agreement respecting any particular transaction.<a href="#N_17_"><sup>(17)</sup></a>  The <u>New York

CBAs may be overridden by arbitrators in arriving at arbitrally
imposed implementing agreements.  The authority to do so derives
from 49 U.S.C. 11341 as explained by the ICC in <u>Carmen I</u> and
<u>Dispatchers I</u> and affirmed by the Supreme Court in <u>N&amp;W</u> and from
49 U.S.C. 11347 as explained by the ICC in <u>Carmen II</u>.

<p>	Under the approach reflected by the ICC's decision in <u>Carmen

overridden.<a href="#N_18_"><sup>(18)</sup></a>  Under the alternative approach reflected by the

<p>	The present proceedings arise out of implementing agreement
arbitrations conducted under the auspices of Article I, section 4
of the <u>New York Dock</u> conditions.  The procedural mechanism
provided, like the procedural mechanism provided by the WJPA from
which section 4 was derived,<a href="#N_21_"><sup>(21)</sup></a> reflects the understanding that
CBA modifications necessary to permit implementation of

be relegated to the purposefully drawn-out procedures provided by

the CBA status quo, and it was recognized that, in many

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Article I, section 4, which permits CBA modifications to be

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	The implementing agreements imposed in arbitration under
labor conditions that antedated <u>New York Dock</u> generally focused
on <em>selection of forces</em> and <em>assignment of work</em>.   <u>See</u>, <u>e.g.</u>, WJPA
section 5, reproduced at <u>Carmen II</u>, 6 I.C.C.2d at 779.  The ICC,
in the course of discussing this matter at some length in its
<u>Carmen II</u> decision, noted that "[i]f the 1940-80 arbitrators felt
themselves bound by these terms, they must have defined them
broadly enough to include contract changes involving the movement
of work (and probably employees) as well as adjustments in
seniority."  <u>Carmen II</u>, 6 I.C.C.2d at 721.  Nevertheless, the
dispute resolution mechanism established by WJPA section 5, the
ICC noted, embraced more than selection and assignment of forces,
narrowly defined.  It encompassed also the modification of
certain contractual rights; it embraced whatever was necessary to
the effectuation of those projects that were the direct results
of the merger.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>			Negotiators and arbitrators may well
have followed the rubric of "selection of
forces and assignment of employees" when
administering the provisions governing the
effect of consolidations.  The scope of these
terms, however, is not well defined.  It must
extend beyond the mere mechanism for
selection or assignment of employees, and
include the modification of certain important
contractual rights.  <em><u>Southern</u></em> [<u>Southern Ry.
Co.--Control--Central of Georgia Ry. Co.</u>, 331
I.C.C. 151 (1967)] and Bernstein [an
arbitrator cited in <u>Carmen II</u> ] make it clear
that work was transferred from one railroad
to another despite contrary contractual
provisions in CBAs.  It was also obvious that
contractual seniority rights were modified in
order to consolidate rosters of the two
separate, combining railroads.  <em><u>See</u> <u>Southern</u> </em>
at 165, 185.  These rosters may have been
"dove-tailed" or another method [may have
been] agreed upon or decreed by an
arbitrator.  We can assume that the
reassignment of employees would have
regularly taken place despite CBA
prohibitions.  These actions are the sort
that would be necessary to permit almost any
consolidation of the functions of two merging
railroads.  The WJPA procedures make it
possible.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><u>Carmen II</u>, 6 I.C.C.2d at 742 (footnotes omitted).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	In short, the ICC in <u>Carmen II</u> defined the scope of
authority of arbitrators to modify CBAs under Article I, section
4 of <u>New York Dock</u> by reference to the practice of arbitrators
during the period 1940-1980.  Although this is by no means a
bright line definition, it has been accepted as a practicable
working definition by the courts, <u>see</u> <u>RLEA</u>, <u>ADTA</u>, and <u>UTU</u>, and we
will adopt it too.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	The ICC also explained in <u>Carmen II</u> that three additional
crucial limitations restrict the CBA modifications that can be
effected by an arbitrator under section 4.  The transaction
sought to be implemented must be an <em>approved transaction</em>; the
modifications must be <em>necessary</em> to the implementation of that
transaction; and the modifications cannot reach CBA <em>rights,
privileges, or benefits</em> protected by Article I, section 2 of the
<u>New York Dock</u> conditions.  We agree with the ICC and will discuss
how we intend to apply each of these limitations in the light of
intervening court decisions.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong><a name="_1_14"></a>Approved Transaction.</strong>  Section 11343(a) provided that
certain transactions could be carried out only with the approval
and authorization of the ICC; section 11344(c) provided that the
ICC should approve and authorize such transactions only if they
were consistent with the public interest; section 11347 directed
the ICC, when approving such transactions, to require the rail
carrier to provide a fair arrangement protective of the interests
of its employees; and section 11341(a) provided that a rail
carrier participating in an approved transaction was exempt from
otherwise applicable law, as necessary to carry out the
transaction.  But none of these provisions defined the scope of
the transaction approved by the ICC under section 11344(c) and
thereby immunized against other law under section 11341(a).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Although a narrow interpretation of the word <em>transaction</em> 
has frequently been sought by rail labor, it is now settled that
the proper and court-approved interpretation of the word
<em>transaction</em> is the interpretation established by the ICC.  The
ICC, with the approval of the courts, held that the word, as used
in 49&nbsp;U.S.C. 11343, 11344, 11347, and 11341, embraced two
categories of transactions:  the principal transaction approved
by the ICC (generally a consolidation or acquisition of control);
and subsequent transactions that were directly related to and
grew out of, or flowed from, that principal transaction (such as
consolidations of facilities, transfer of work assignments,
etc.).  "The approval of a principal transaction extends to and
encompasses subsequent transactions that are directly related to
and fulfill the purposes of the principal transaction (<em>i.e.</em>,
those which, the Supreme Court noted, would allow 'the
efficiencies of consolidation' to be achieved)."  <u>CSX&nbsp;23</u>,
8&nbsp;I.C.C.2d at 722.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	In our view, "approved" transactions include those
specifically authorized by the ICC, such as the various proposals
we have approved which led to the formation of CSXT and those
that are directly related to and grow out of, or flow from, such
a specifically authorized transaction.  The instant transaction,
the transfer of the dispatching functions, falls into the latter
category.  The existence of this second category of transactions
is implicit in the definition of the term "transaction" in the
standard labor protective conditions:  "[A]ny action taken
pursuant to authorizations of the ICC on which these provisions
have been imposed."  <em><u>New York Dock</u></em>, 360 I.C.C. at 84, <u>CSX 23</u>, 8
I.C.C.2d at 720-21 (footnote and internal cross-references
omitted).  The omitted footnote cites <u>New York Dock</u>, 360 I.C.C.
at 70:  "[T]he broad definition [of 'transaction'] is necessary
in the types of transactions for which approval is required under
49 U.S.C. 11343 <em><u>et</u> <u>seq.</u></em>, because the event actually affecting the
employees might occur at a later date than the initial
transaction, yet still pursuant to our approval (consolidation of
employee rosters, <u>et</u> <u>cetera</u>)."  In <u>ATDA</u>, 26 F.3d at 1165, the
court, in affirming <u>CSX 23</u>, found reasonable the ICC's view that
the term <em>approved transaction</em> "extends to subsidiary transactions
that fulfill the purposes of the main control transaction"; the
court added that "[t]he ICC's elastic construction of 'approved
transaction' in this case mirrors [the] settled understanding [of
the term]."  Moreover, it is now settled that the mere passage of
time does not prevent a finding of nexus between the proposed
changes and the initially approved transaction.  <u>UTU</u>, 108 F.3d at
1430-31.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong><a name="_1_15"></a>Necessity.</strong>  A CBA override can be had only if such override
is <em>necessary</em> to carry out a transaction approved under
49&nbsp;U.S.C.&nbsp;11344(c).  The necessity requirement is explicit in
49&nbsp;U.S.C. 11341(a); it has been held to be implicit in 49 U.S.C.
11347, <u>Carmen II</u>, <u>RLEA</u>, 987 F.2d at 814-15; it is therefore, on
both counts, part and parcel of Article I, section&nbsp;4 of the <u>New
York Dock</u> conditions.  "This 'necessity' finding is not optional;
pre-transaction labor arrangements cannot be modified without
it."  <u>Fox Valley &amp; Western Ltd.--Exemption Acquisition and
Operation--Certain Lines of Green Bay and Western Railroad
Company, Fox River Valley Railroad Corporation, and the Ahnapee &amp;

32035 (Sub-Nos. 2-6) (<u>Fox Valley</u>) (ICC served Aug. 10, 1995)
(slip op. at 2) (citation omitted).  Whatever the standard of
necessity may be where only 11341(a) is involved, it is settled
that there is one and only one necessity standard where section
11347 and the <u>New York Dock</u> conditions are relied upon by the
arbitrator as the basis for overriding CBA provisions.  <u>ATDA</u>, 26
F.3d at 1164-65. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Although, as we have noted above, the ICC in <u>Carmen II</u> did
not attempt to define what would constitute necessity in such
cases, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals has subsequently held,
and we have accepted that holding, that a CBA override can be
effected only where there are transportation benefits of the
underlying transaction; it cannot be effected if the only benefit
of the modification derives from the CBA modification itself. 
<u>RLEA</u>, 987 F.2d at 814-15.  "[W]e do not see how the agency can be
said to have shown the 'necessity' for modifying a CBA unless it
shows that the modification is necessary in order to secure to
the public some transportation benefit flowing from the
underlying transaction (here a lease)."  <u>RLEA</u>, 987 F.2d at 815. 
"[T]he benefit cannot arise from the CBA modification itself;
considered independently of the CBA, the transaction must yield
enhanced efficiency, greater safety, or some other gain."  <u>ATDA</u>,
26 F.3d at 1164.  <u>See</u> <u>also</u> <u>UTU</u>, 108 F.3d at 1431.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Under the approach adopted in <u>Carmen II</u>, the necessity
determination generally had to be made in the first instance by
an arbitrator, though it was generally reviewable by the ICC.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	As stated by the ICC in its <u>Fox Valley</u> decision (slip op. at
3):

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>			Arbitrators should also be aware that in
[<u>RLEA</u> ] the court admonished us to identify
which changes in pre-transaction labor
arrangements are necessary to secure the
public benefits of the transaction and which
are not.  <em>We have generally delegated to
arbitrators the task of determining the
particular changes that are and are not
necessary to carry out the purposes of the
transaction</em>, subject only to review under our
<u>Lace Curtain</u> standards [referenced below]. 
Arbitrators should discuss the necessity of
modifications to pre-transaction labor
arrangements, taking care to reconcile the
operational needs of the transaction with the
need to preserve pre-transaction
arrangements.  Arbitrators should not require
the carrier to bear a heavy burden (for
example, through detailed operational
studies) in justifying operational and
related work assignment and employment level
changes that are clearly necessary to make
the merged entity operate efficiently as a
unified system rather than as two separate
entities, if these changes are identified
with reasonable particularity.  But
arbitrators should not assume that all pre-transaction labor arrangements, no matter how
remotely they are connected with operational
efficiency or other public benefits of the
transaction, must be modified to carry out
the purposes of a transaction.  (footnote
omitted).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong><a name="_1_16"></a>Rights, Privileges, and Benefits.</strong>  The necessity standard of
49 U.S.C. 11341(a) and 11347 provides one check upon the CBA
modification authority entrusted to arbitrators under Article I,
section 4 of the <u>New York Dock</u> conditions.  The rights,
privileges, and benefits standard of Article I, section 2 of <u>New
York Dock</u><a href="#N_23_"><sup>(23)</sup></a> provides another check upon that authority.  That
provision states that certain rights, privileges, and benefits
afforded employees under pre-transaction CBAs must be preserved.  
<u>RLEA</u>, 987 F.2d at 814 (noting, however, that not every word of
every CBA establishes a right, privilege, or benefit); <u>ATDA</u>, 26
F.3d at 1163 (indicating that a CBA "scope" provision creates no
rights, privileges, or benefits). 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Although it was a hotly contested issue at the time these
proceedings were remanded, the definition of rights, privileges
and benefits has now been established by an ICC decision, which
we have adopted and applied,<a href="#N_24_"><sup>(24)</sup></a> and by the affirmance of that ICC
decision by the D.C. Circuit.  In <u>CSX Corporation--Control--
Chessie System, Inc. and Seaboard Coast Line Industries, Inc., et

(ICC served Dec.&nbsp;7, 1995) (<u>CSX 27</u>) (slip op. at 14-16), the ICC
defined the rights, privileges, and benefits that cannot be
overridden to include such things as group life insurance,
hospitalization and medical care, free transportation, sick
leave, continued status and participation under any disability or
retirement program, and such other employee benefits as Railroad
Retirement, Social Security, Workmen's Compensation, and
unemployment compensation.  Protected rights, privileges, and
benefits do not embrace scope rules and seniority provisions. 
Such rules and provisions, the ICC noted, have historically been
changed in arbitration conducted under Article&nbsp;I, section 4 of
the <u>New York Dock</u> conditions, or under the comparable provisions
of the predecessor labor protective conditions imposed prior to
1979.  The rights, privileges, and benefits that must be
preserved, the ICC added, do not include pre-transaction union
representation arrangements.<a href="#N_25_"><sup>(25)</sup></a>  <u>Aff'd</u>, <u>UTU</u>.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	In explaining our denial of a petition to stay the ICC's <u>CSX

conditions are not rights, privileges, or benefits that must be
preserved.<a href="#N_26_"><sup>(26)</sup></a>  "[I]t is now well established that changes in rates
of pay, rules, and working conditions can be required by this

modification is necessary to obtain the benefits of a transaction
that was approved as being in the public interest."  <u>CSX 27 Stay
Decision</u>, slip op. at&nbsp;3.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	In affirming the ICC's Sub-No. 27 Decision, the court
observed (108 F.3d at 1430):

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>		[2] In this case, the Commission offers a
definition:  "rights, privileges, and benefits" refers
to "the incidents of employment, ancillary emoluments
or fringe benefits--as opposed to the more central
aspects of the work itself--pay, rules and working
conditions."  <u>See</u> <u>Commission decision</u> at 14, <u>reprinted
in</u> J.A. 237.  And "the incidents of employment,
ancillary emoluments or fringe benefits" refers to
employees' vested and accrued benefits, such as life
insurance, hospitalization and medical care, sick
leave, and similar benefits.  <u>See</u> <u>id.</u> at 15, <u>reprinted
in</u> J.A. 238.  According to the Commission, seniority
provisions are not within the compass of "rights,
privileges, and benefits" protected absolutely from the
Commission's abrogation authority.  <u>See</u> <u>id.</u>  On this
point, the Commission notes that seniority provisions
"have consistently been modified in the past in
connection within [sic] consolidations. This may be due
to the fact that almost all consolidations require
scope and seniority changes in order to effectuate the
purpose of the transaction.  Railway Labor Act
bargaining over these aspects of a consolidation would
frustrate the transactions."  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><u>Id.</u>  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	The court went on to affirm this definition in the following
language, which is dispositive of the issue:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>		The Commission's interpretation is reasonable. 
<u>See</u> <u>American Train Dispatchers Ass'n v. ICC</u>, 54 F.3d
842, 847-48 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (holding that the ICC's
interpretation of <u>New York Dock</u> rules is entitled to
substantial deference by a reviewing court).  Under the
Commission's interpretation, "rights, privileges and
benefits" are protected absolutely, while other
employee interests that are not inviolate are protected
by a test of "necessity," pursuant to which there must
be a showing of a nexus between the changes sought and
the effectuation of an ICC-approved transaction.  Under
this scheme, the public interest in effectuating
approved consolidations is ensured without any undue
sacrifice of employee interests.  In our view, this is
exactly what was intended by Congress.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><u>Id.</u>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong><a name="_1_17"></a>Takings.</strong>  An argument has been advanced that any CBA
override effected under Article I, section 4 of the <u>New York Dock</u>
conditions amounts to a "taking" of private property in violation
of the Fifth Amendment.  That question cannot be resolved by a
<u>New York Dock</u> arbitrator, it cannot be resolved by an
administrative agency reviewing an award issued by the
arbitrator, and it cannot be resolved even by an appellate court
reviewing a decision entered by the administrative agency.  <u>See</u>

in the court of Federal Claims or, in certain limited
circumstances, in a District court).<a href="#N_27_"><sup>(27)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong><a name="_1_18"></a>Whether Section 11341 Is Limited by Section 11347</strong>.  As
discussed, in 1991 the Supreme Court left open the question
whether CBA overrides authorized by 49 U.S.C. 11341 might be
limited by 49 U.S.C. 11347.  <u>N&amp;W</u>, 499 U.S. at 134.  We conclude
that, where as here <u>New York Dock</u> conditions are required to be
imposed, section 11341 is constrained by section 11347 and the
provisions of these labor conditions.  We believe that it is
unnecessary and would be unwise here to attempt to resolve the
issue of the reach of section 11341 unconstrained by section
11347 and the <u>New York Dock</u> conditions, because the orders of the
ICC in <u>Carmen I</u> and <u>Dispatchers I</u> are affirmable under either
section 11341 or section 11347.  Therefore, following the lead of
the D.C. Circuit under substantially identical circumstances in
<u>ATDA</u>, 26 F.3d at 1165, we affirm the orders in <u>Carmen I</u> and
<u>Dispatchers I</u> applying the reasons and standards articulated in
<u>Carmen II</u> as discussed herein.  We vacate the order in <u>Carmen II</u>
insofar as it vacates the arbitrators' decisions and remands the
matters to the parties for further negotiation and arbitration,
if necessary.  We believe this approach is appropriate because,
as in <u>ATDA</u>, the transportation benefits from the consolidations
proposed by NS and CSX are sufficient to pass the <u>RLEA</u> necessity
test and we can see nothing to be gained by further prolonging
this already very protracted process.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	We believe it would be unwise to attempt to resolve the
issue of the reach of section 11341, now section 11321, in the
abstract as that issue is not presented in this case.  We would
prefer to address it in the context of a case in which our <u>New
York Dock</u> conditions do not apply so that the question of whether
section 11341, now section 11321, is limited by section 11347,
now section 11326, in the modification of collective bargaining
agreements is the sole issue presented.  Such a proceeding will
of necessity take account of changes made by the ICCTA, which in
effect limit our imposition of <u>New York Dock</u> labor conditions to
consolidations or acquisitions of control as described in current
section 11326(a).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	In 1987 the arbitration committee directed CSX and BRC to
adopt the implementing agreement that had been proposed by CSX,
subject to one exception:  that Waycross employees covered by the
Orange Book could not be compelled to transfer to Raceland. 
<u>LaRocco Award</u>, at 41.  In 1988 the ICC (1) affirmed the LaRocco
Award insofar as it had approved the movement of the work
performed at Waycross, (2) reversed the LaRocco Award insofar as
it had created an Orange Book employees exception to the
prescribed implementing agreement, and (3) remanded to the
committee (in effect, to the parties) for further proceedings
consistent with the ICC's decision subject to the admonition that
the transfer of employees would be subject to <u>New York Dock</u>
protections.  <u>Carmen I</u>, 4 I.C.C.2d at 650, 655.  In 1989 the D.C.
Circuit reversed the ICC's decision and remanded to the agency to
permit it to determine whether further proceedings were
necessary.  <u>Carmen</u>, 880 F.2d at 574.  In 1990 the ICC reversed
and vacated the <u>LaRocco Award</u>, effectively remanding the entire 
proceeding to the parties to recommence the implementing process
in accordance with Article I, section 4 of the <u>New York Dock</u>
conditions "through further negotiations or arbitration, if
necessary, to reach [a] new implementing agreement[] in
accordance with the standards set forth in this decision." 
<u>Carmen II</u>, 6 I.C.C.2d at 757.  Finally, in 1991, the Supreme
Court reversed the D.C. Circuit's <u>Carmen</u> decision and remanded to
the D.C. Circuit for further proceedings, <u>N&amp;W</u>, 499 U.S. at 134;
and the D.C. Circuit remanded both <u>Carmen I</u> and <u>Carmen II</u> to the
ICC for reconsideration in light of <u>N&amp;W</u>.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	If the Finance Docket No. 28905 (Sub-No. 22) proceeding had
been handled by the ICC in the usual fashion, it would have been
held in abeyance while a certiorari petition was pending, and,
once certiorari had been granted, it would have continued to be
held in abeyance pending a decision of the Supreme Court.  If
this proceeding had been handled in that fashion, the Supreme
Court's <u>N&amp;W</u> decision would have returned the proceeding to the
D.C. Circuit, which could then have decided the various issues it
had left open in <u>Carmen</u>.  And, if this proceeding had been
handled in the usual fashion, the ICC would never have issued its
<u>Carmen II</u> decision.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	CSX contends that, even though this proceeding was not
handled in the usual fashion, the outcome should be the same as
if it had been.  CSX argues that the order entered in <u>Carmen</u>&nbsp;<u>II</u>
(reversing and vacating the <u>LaRocco Award</u>) is a nullity, because,
as a matter of law, the Supreme Court's reversal of the D.C.
Circuit's <u>Carmen</u> decision reinstated the ICC's <u>Carmen&nbsp;I</u> decision. 
The reversal of a court judgment, CSX insists, nullifies orders
issued in any subsequent proceeding that were dependent upon the
reversed judgment.  <u>Carmen II</u>, in CSX's view, was dependent upon
<u>Carmen</u>, because, again in CSX's view, the ICC issued <u>Carmen&nbsp;II</u>
solely to comply with the D.C. Circuit's <u>Carmen</u> decision.  CSX
therefore urges that we simply reinstate, without further ado,
the ICC's <u>Carmen I</u> decision.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<u>Carmen II</u> <em>was</em> issued upon the predicate that the court of
appeals decision overturning <u>Carmen I</u> was correct but it was not
issued <em>solely</em> in compliance with the court of appeals decision,
and therein lies the flaw in CSX's argument.  As the Supreme
Court recognized in <u>N&amp;W</u>, 499 U.S. at 128 n.3, in denying labor
respondent's motion to dismiss, <u>Carmen II</u> was decided on an
alternative basis which could not be said to have ended the
dispute between the parties there.  As a result, the Supreme
Court concluded that the definitive interpretation of section
11341 provided by its decision may affect the ICC's <u>Carmen II</u>
decision.  <u>Id.</u>  There was no suggestion in the decision of the
Supreme Court that its decision supplanted the <u>Carmen II</u>
decision.  In fact, the Supreme Court noted the pendency of a
review proceeding and went on to say that the court on review
might not agree with the ICC's interpretation in <u>Carmen II</u>, 499
U.S. at 126-28, n.2 and 3.  It was to permit the ICC [and now the
Board] to arrive at a determination as to what effect, if any,
the Supreme Court's <u>N&amp;W</u> decision would have on <u>Carmen II</u>, that
<u>Carmen II</u> was remanded to the ICC.  We conclude that the <u>N&amp;W</u>
decision should have no effect and that <u>Carmen II</u> should stand as
decided subject of course to the subsequent developments in the
law referred to in this decision and subject to our modification
of the relief provided in <u>Carmen II</u>.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	In cases reviewing decisions involving CBA modification
under sections 11347/11326 and Article I, section 4 of our <u>New
York Dock</u> conditions, the D.C. Circuit has adopted a two part
test: (1) is there a nexus between the changes sought and an
approved transaction, and (2) is there a transportation benefit
to the public from the transaction.  If the answers to both
questions (1) and (2) are in the affirmative, then the
modifications are deemed necessary and permitted unless they
involve "rights, privileges, and benefits" protected from change
by Article I, section 2 of <u>New York Dock</u>.  <em><u>See</u></em> <u>UTU</u>, 108 F.2d at

<p>		     We find that the applicants' estimate of
employee impacts is reasonable.  What dislocations
there are promise to be short term.  It is
certainly possible that as the two systems mesh
their operations, additional coordinations may
occur that could lead to further employee
displacements.  However, no wholesale disruption
of the carriers' work force should occur.  Only at
points where the basically end-to-end systems meet
does it appear that perceptible dislocations will
result.  Those common point locations are clearly
identified.  We believe that the standard
conditions will adequately protect those employees
now identified as affected by the consolidation as

but are not now identified specifically.

<p><u>CSX Control</u>, 363 I.C.C. at 589.  Both CSX and BRC have quoted
from this passage, but they have emphasized different parts of
it.  CSX has emphasized that the ICC was aware that there might
be "additional coordinations" (i.e., coordinations beyond those
specifically mentioned in the <u>CSX Control</u> application), and that
employees might be affected by the proposed transaction "in the
future."  This, CSX contends, demonstrates that the ICC
anticipated that transactions such as the 1986 Waycross/Raceland
transfer would be embraced within the principal transaction
approved in <u>CSX Control</u>.  BRC emphasizes the ICC's expectation
that employee dislocations would be "short term" and that
perceptible dislocations would occur only at points "where the
basically end-to-end systems meet."  Noting that the 1986
Waycross/Raceland transfer was six years delayed (and was
therefore not a "short term" dislocation) and that Waycross and
Raceland are hundreds of miles apart (and therefore are not
located at junction points of the two end-to-end systems), BRC
contends that the cited passage demonstrates that the ICC never
anticipated that transactions such as the 1986 Waycross/Raceland
transfer would be embraced within the principal transaction
approved in <u>CSX Control</u>.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	The ICC, in its 1992 <u>CSX 23</u> decision, discussed the scope of
the principal transaction approved in <u>CSX Control</u>.  Quoting parts
of the passage we have quoted in whole, the ICC concluded that
"as far back as 1980, we contemplated that the applicants could
undertake operational changes to improve efficiency which we had
not considered in the decision and that specific approval of
these coordinations was not necessary."  <u>CSX 23</u>, 8 I.C.C.2d at
725.  We agree with this assessment, which was approved by the
D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals on review in <u>ATDA</u>, 26 F.3d at 1165. 
We believe those decisions are dispositive of the substantially
identical issue here. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	We agree with the ICC and the D.C. Circuit and adopt the
view that the approval of a principal transaction extends to and
encompasses subsequent transactions that are directly related to,
and fulfill the purposes of, the principal transaction.<a href="#N_28_"><sup>(28)</sup></a>  <u>CSX
23</u>, 8 I.C.C.2d at 722.  As long as there is "a reasonably direct
causal connection between the [principal] transaction and the
operational changes sought to be implemented," such operational
changes are embraced within the principal transaction.  <u>CSX 23</u>, 8
I.C.C.2d at 724&nbsp;n.14.  The 1986 Waycross/Raceland transfer meets
these tests.  It is directly related to the 1980 <u>CSX Control</u>
principal transaction (common control of C&amp;O and SCL allowed CSX
to consolidate the work performed at Waycross and Raceland) and
it fulfills the purposes of the principal transaction (one such
purpose was the achievement of efficiencies made possible by
common control).  We therefore conclude that the 1986
Waycross/Raceland transfer was embraced within the principal
transaction approved in the 1980 <u>CSX Control</u> decision.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	In the Finance Docket No. 28905 (Sub-No. 22) proceeding, the
focus of the necessity issue has always been the Orange Book,
and, in particular, the twin prohibitions respecting transfer of
work and transfer of employees.  In 1987 the arbitration
committee determined that an override of the work transfer
prohibition was necessary, but that an override of the employee
transfer prohibition was not necessary.  <u>LaRocco Award</u>, at 35-38. 
In 1988 the ICC, relying heavily on the necessity standard
announced in <u>DRGW</u>, determined that an override of both
prohibitions was necessary.  <u>Carmen I</u>, 4&nbsp;I.C.C.2d at 648-50. 
Thus the decision in <u>Carmen I</u> affirmed the award insofar as it
provided for the transfer of work but vacated and remanded for
further negotiation or arbitration, if necessary, the part of the
award that prohibited the transfer of employees.  Two years later
the ICC changed course, and vacated and remanded the entire
proceeding to allow CSX and BRC to negotiate or arbitrate, "if
necessary, to reach [a] new implementing agreement[] in
accordance with the standards set forth in this decision."<a href="#N_29_"><sup>(29)</sup></a> 
<u>Carmen II</u>, 6 I.C.C.2d at 756-57. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	We are now affirming the <u>Carmen I</u> order in all respects.  We
expect CSX and BRC to negotiate or arbitrate, if necessary, any
issues associated with the transfer of personnel we have found to
be required to the extent these issues continue to have vitality.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	CSX contends that the ICC erred in <u>Carmen II</u> in retreating
from the necessity standard announced in <u>DRGW</u> and relied upon in
<u>Carmen I</u>, and <u>CSX 23</u>, 8&nbsp;I.C.C.2d at 721.  <u>CSX 23</u>, however, was in
this respect somewhat of an overstatement of our authority under
the necessity provision implicit in Article I, section 4 of the
<u>New York Dock</u> conditions as interpreted in <u>Carmen II</u>.  <u>See</u> <u>ATDA</u>,
26&nbsp;F.3d at 1165.  We will therefore adhere to the position
announced in <u>Carmen II</u> that the authority of arbitrators to
modify collective bargaining agreements is limited by the
practice of arbitrators from 1940-1980 for cases subject to the
<u>New York Dock</u> conditions.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	As we have indicated earlier, we need not decide whether
this transaction meets the standard for necessity embodied in 49
U.S.C. 11341/11321 upon which the <u>Carmen I</u> and <u>Dispatchers I</u>
decisions were based or implicit in 11347/11326 as a result of
the <u>Carmen II</u> decision and certain decisions of the D.C. Circuit,
especially <u>UTU</u> and <u>ATDA</u>, which have embraced the <u>Carmen II</u>
approach, because it is clear that it satisfies both.  Under
these circumstances, we reaffirm the [ICC's] decision in <u>Carmen I</u>
as consistent with the approach adopted in that decision and
affirmed by the Supreme Court in <u>N&amp;W</u> and as satisfying the
alternative and more limited approach adopted in <u>Carmen II</u> which
we are reaffirming here.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	CSX and BRC should attempt to resolve any remaining aspects
of the dispute concerning transfer of personnel from Waycross to
Raceland by negotiation.  If an agreement has not been reached by
the end of the 30-day negotiation period required by Article I,
section 4, either party may then (or thereafter) demand binding
arbitration in accordance with Article I, section 4.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	In 1987 the arbitration committee adopted, with one minor
exception, the implementing agreement that had been proposed by
NS, <u>Harris Award</u>, at 17-18, and in 1988 the ICC affirmed,
<u>Dispatchers I</u>, 4 I.C.C.2d at 1092.  In 1989 the D.C. Circuit
reversed the ICC's decision and remanded to the ICC in order that
the ICC might determine whether further proceedings were
necessary.  <u>Carmen</u>, 880 F.2d at 574.  In 1990 the ICC reversed
and vacated the <u>Harris Award</u>, effectively remanding the
proceeding to the parties to continue the implementing process in
accordance with Article I, section 4 of the <u>New York Dock</u>
conditions "through further negotiations or arbitration, if
necessary, to reach [a] new implementing agreement[] in
accordance with the standards set forth in this decision." 
<u>Carmen II</u>, 6 I.C.C.2d at 757.  Finally, in 1991, the Supreme
Court reversed the D.C. Circuit's <u>Carmen</u> decision and remanded to
the D.C. Circuit for further proceedings, <u>N&amp;W</u>, 499 U.S. at 134,
and the D.C. Circuit remanded to the ICC for reconsideration in
light of <u>N&amp;W</u>.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	NS, advancing an automatic nullification argument much like
CSX's, contends that the outcome in the Finance Docket No. 29430
(Sub-No. 20) proceeding should be what it would have been had the
proceeding been held in abeyance pending final action by the
Supreme Court.  NS argues that the order entered in <u>Carmen II</u>
(reversing and vacating the <u>Harris Award</u>) is a nullity, because,
as a matter of law, the Supreme Court's reversal of the D.C.
Circuit's <u>Carmen</u> decision reinstated the ICC's <u>Dispatchers&nbsp;I</u>
decision.  The reversal of a court judgment, NS insists,
nullifies orders issued in any subsequent proceeding that were
dependent upon the reversed judgment.  <u>Carmen II</u>, in NS's view,
was dependent upon <u>Carmen</u>, because, again in NS's view, the ICC
issued <u>Carmen&nbsp;II</u> solely to comply with the D.C. Circuit's <u>Carmen</u>
decision.  NS therefore urges that we simply reinstate the ICC's
<u>Dispatchers I</u> decision.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	We conclude, for the reasons provided above in our
discussion of the equivalent argument advanced by CSX, that
<u>Carmen II</u> was not nullified by the Supreme Court's <u>N&amp;W</u> decision,
and we therefore reject NS's request that we simply reinstate
<u>Dispatchers I</u>.  We will, however, reinstate the order affirming
the <u>Harris Award</u>, but for the reasons set forth in <u>Carmen II</u>.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	We now turn to the issues that remain open for
reconsideration in light of <u>N&amp;W</u>:  the approved transaction issue
and the necessity issue.  We will decide the approved transaction
issue ourselves, because it is immediately obvious that there can
be but one answer to this question and because we do not want to
unnecessarily extend this already protracted proceeding.  There
can be no doubt that the centralization of power distribution for
the N&amp;W system in Atlanta was sufficiently related to the
transaction approved in <u>NS Control</u> as to satisfy the standards
for relatedness established in <u>CSX 23</u> and approved by the D.C.
Circuit on review in <u>ATDA</u>, discussed <u>supra</u>, and we so find.  We
will also decide the necessity issue implicit in the Article I,
section 4 implementing agreement process, because it is clear
that there are transportation benefits to N&amp;W's proposal
sufficient to satisfy the necessity criteria established by the
D.C. Circuit in <u>RLEA</u>, <u>ATDA</u>, and <u>UTU</u>.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	In the Finance Docket No. 29430 (Sub-No. 20) proceeding, the
focus of the necessity issue has been the pre-1986 CBA that
covered ATDA-represented supervisors at Roanoke.  The
Roanoke/Atlanta transfer proposed by NS in 1986 effected a CBA
override by leaving the CBA in Roanoke while transferring the
"work function" previously performed thereunder to CBA-free
Atlanta.  <u>Dispatchers I</u>, 4 I.C.C.2d at 1086.  In 1987 the
arbitration committee determined that an override of the Roanoke
CBA was necessary.  <u>Harris Award</u>, at 11-15.  In 1988 the ICC,
relying heavily on the necessity standard announced in <u>Maine
Central</u>, affirmed.  <u>Dispatchers I</u>, 4 I.C.C.2d at 1086-87.<a href="#N_30_"><sup>(30)</sup></a>  Two
years later the ICC changed course.  By order entered June 21,
1990, the ICC reversed and vacated the <u>Harris Award</u>, effectively
remanding the proceeding to the parties.  <u>Carmen II</u>, 6&nbsp;I.C.C.2d
at 775, ordering paragraph 2.  The proceeding was remanded to
allow NS and ATDA to continue the implementing process in
accordance with Article I, section 4 of the <u>New York Dock</u>
conditions "through further negotiations or arbitration, if
necessary, to reach [a] new implementing agreement[] in
accordance with the standards set forth in this decision." 
<u>Carmen II</u>, 6 I.C.C.2d at 756-57.  Eight years have now passed,
but this proceeding appears to be today in essentially the same
posture it was in on June 21, 1990.  A new implementing agreement
has not yet been reached and so far as we have been advised,
neither party has attempted to compel further arbitration.<a href="#N_31_"><sup>(31)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	As a result, the decision we reach today may be declaratory
only and not affect the rights of any of the employees involved. 
However, the question of the manner in which the <u>New York Dock</u>
labor conditions affect arbitrator's rights to set aside CBA
provisions where necessary to implement approved transactions
remains a vital one and it is that question we have attempted to
answer here.  As with the other proceeding covered by this
decision, we will reinstate the order issued in <u>Dispatchers I</u>,
affirming the arbitral decision for the reasons provided in
<u>Carmen II</u> and discussed above at length.

CBAs that permitted the carrying out of the transaction while
maintaining labor peace.  We trust that these parties will be
able to call upon their institutional memories to again resolve
these matters consistently and amicably, now that we have removed
two major impediments to the process."
<p><a name="N_20_">20. </a>       Other issues that were alive at the time of the remand
have since been definitively resolved.  The issue of the
relationship between Article I, section 2 and Article I, section
4 has been resolved by a series of decisions in the D.C. Circuit
culminating in <u>UTU v. STB</u>, 108 F.3d 1425 (D.C. Cir. 1997)(<u>UTU</u>). 
So too has the issue of necessity for purposes of 49 U.S.C. 11347
and 11326.  <u>RLEA</u>, 987 F.2d at 806<u></u>.  We refer to these issues
herein solely for clarity of exposition.

at 778-93.  The procedural mechanism now provided by <u>New York

mechanism provided by WJPA sections 4, 5, and 13.
<p><a name="N_23_">23. </a>       Article I, section 2 of the <u>New York Dock</u> conditions,
360 I.C.C. at 84, provides:  "The rates of pay, rules, working
conditions and all collective bargaining and other rights,
privileges and benefits (including continuation of pension rights
and benefits) of the railroad's employees under applicable laws
and/or existing collective bargaining agreements or otherwise
shall be preserved unless changed by future collective bargaining
agreements or applicable statutes."

has been implemented pursuant to an award imposed under

respecting union representation arrangements are subject to the
sole jurisdiction of the National Mediation Board under the RLA.

carriers closed the Waycross repair facility and abolished the
positions of carmen employed at that facility.  A total of 88
carmen and 11 painter positions were abolished at that time.  Of
these carmen, 54 accepted separation pay and terminated their
employment with the SCL.  Twenty-three other carmen bid on new
positions on the rip track located at Waycross.  Nine or 10
junior employees who were unable to hold a position at Waycross
accepted transfers to Raceland.") (footnotes omitted).

positions at Atlanta were offered to the nine active and three
furloughed Roanoke supervisors.  Of the nine active supervisors,
eight moved to Atlanta and one declined.  Of the three furloughed
supervisors, one moved to Atlanta and two declined.  As of
July&nbsp;2, 1990:  of the eight active supervisors who had moved to
Atlanta, seven had retired and one was still actively employed
there; and the one furloughed supervisor who had moved to Atlanta
was also still actively employed there.  <u>See</u> NS's July 2, 1990
