<b>PALEZONE SHINER</b>

(Notropis sp.)
<p>FAMILY: Cyprinidae
<p>STATUS: Endangered, Federal Register, April 27, 1993
<p>DESCRIPTION: The palezone shiner (Notropis albizonatus) is an extremely
slender, cylindrical minnow that reaches a
<br>maximum standard length (SL) of about 60 millimeters (mm) (Warren et
al. 1994). A brief description and color photo are
<br>presented by Etnier and Starnes (1993). In previous publications, this
shiner has been referred to as the white-zone shiner and
<br>paleband shiner.
<p>The following description is summarized from a taxonomic description
of the species provided by Warren et al. (1994). The
<br>most distinctive aspects of the species are characters of pigmentation.
Chromatic breeding colors apparently do not develop,
<br>but specimens collected in late June had a faint wash of yellow at
the base of the pectoral rays. General body coloration is a
<br>light, translucent straw (quickly fading to paler opaque in preservative)
with dark scale margins evident dorsally. The narrow,
<br>dark mid-lateral stripe, suffused by silver in life, runs over the
lateral-line scale row onto the silvery operculum and becomes
<br>dusky or wanting postorbitally. It continues as a preocular bar and
often encircles the snout as a discernible but dusky stripe on
<br>the upper lip and anterior snout. A dark, small basicaudal spot, often
chevron- or wedge-shaped (apex forward), is present
<br>and is about as wide as, but slightly separated from, the mid-lateral
stripe.
<p>Extending the length of the body, just above and contrasting sharply
with the mid-lateral stripe, is the "pale zone" or supralateral
<br>stripe, a broad and relatively pigmentless stripe about two scale rows
in width that is bordered dorsally by (and contrasts
<br>sharply with) the darkly pigmented margins of the scales on the dorsum.
Dorsally all scale margins are darkly outlined with
<br>melanophores, creating a cross-hatched effect anteriorly. The predorsal
stripe is weakly developed or absent; the postdorsal
<br>stripe is absent. Dark blotches before dorsal and caudal fins are noticeably
darker than dorsalateral scale margins. Lateral line
<br>scales are usually 36-38; predorsal scale rows are usually 16 or 17.
<p>Superficially similar syntopic species (mimic shiner, N. volucellus
and the undescribed sawfin shiner, N. sp. cf. spectrunculus)
<br>can be distinguished from the palezone shiner by their deeper body,
lack of the virtually unpigmented supralateral stripe (the
<br>"pale zone"), especially anteriorly, and a less intense mid-lateral
mid-stripe; by having eight anal rays, anterior lateral-line scales
<br>elevated, and a well-developed predorsal stripe; and in the sawfin
shiner, by having only the first 4 or 5 rays of the dorsal fin
<br>being outlined with melanophores.
<p>RANGE AND POPULATION LEVEL: The palezone shiner has been collected only
from the Little South Fork of the
<br>Cumberland River LSFCR (Cumberland River drainage, Wayne/McCreary counties,
Kentucky); Marrowbone Creek
<br>(Cumberland River drainage, Cumberland County, Kentucky); Paint Rock
River (PRR) (a Tennessee River tributary, Jackson
<br>County, Alabama); and Cove Creek, a Clinch River tributary (Tennessee
River drainage, Campbell County, Tennessee).
<p>The collections of Warren and Burr (1990) from Spring (June) and Summer
(August) of 1990 indicate that the species
<br>presently occurs in LSFCR from about Freedom Church Ford upstream to
2 miles southwest of Parmleysville, Kentucky.
<br>From available collection data over the past decade (including their
1990 survey), Warren and Burr judged that the species is
<br>most abundant in a 6-mile reach of the LSFCR from about the mouth of
Corder Creek downstream to Freedom Church Ford.
<br>The most upstream reported collection site is at the Highway 167 bridge
(River Mile 35.2, 1 mile southwest of Mt. Pisgah,
<br>Wayne County, Kentucky). This report comes from a single (identification
unconfirmed) specimen taken October 22, 1987,
<br>(M. Mills, Kentucky Division of Water, personal communication). Warren
and Burr (1990) and others have not taken the
<br>species that far upstream. The approximate downstream limits of the
species in LSFCR are at or just below Freedom Church
<br>Ford (RM 5.4). The LSFCR downstream of Freedom Church Ford is impounded
by backwaters of Lake Cumberland at
<br>about RM 4.1 (corresponding to the location of Freedom Chapel), depending
on the pool level in the reservoir (Millican
<br>Associates, Inc., 1982). The backwaters eliminate the riffle and pool
complexes characteristic of the upstream reaches of the
<br>river. Given the affinity of the shiner for flowing shallow pools,
it is unlikely that the palezone shiner is a permanent part of the
<br>ichthyofauna of the Lake Cumberland backwaters that inundate the lower
4.1 miles of LSFCR.
<p>The Marrowbone Creek record is based on a single specimen that was collected
in 1947, at the mouth of Ferris Creek,
<br>Cumberland County, Kentucky [specimen confirmed by Burr (1980) and
by Burr and Warren (1986)]. The reach of
<br>Marrowbone Creek that yielded this specimen has been surveyed on many
occasions without revealing additional specimens.
<br>The single specimen recorded from the creek was taken about 3 years
before closure of Wolf Creek Dam to form Lake
<br>Cumberland (Henley 1967). Given the small size and extreme low-flow
of the creek (at least currently) the specimen may have
<br>represented a waif from a population that then resided in the lower
reaches of the drainage (Warren and Burr 1990). Presently,
<br>the lowermost reaches of the creek are periodically embayed by cold
tailwater releases from Wolf Creek Dam, inundating the
<br>species' potential habitat. Additionally, shade-producing riparian
vegetation has been removed along much of the creek, and the
<br>watershed is deforested and highly agriculturalized (Warren and Burr
1990).
<p>Within the PRR system, where the species was discovered only recently
(Jandebeur and Chapman 1982, Feeman 1987),
<br>specimens have been collected from about River Mile 15 [from as far
downstream as 1.3 miles northeast of Princeton,
<br>Alabama, and upstream to the town of Estill Fork on Estill Fork, Alabama.
<p>Jandebeur and Chapman (1982) reported a total of 47 fish collections
from stations located throughout the PRR drainage, but
<br>they only collected the palezone in this limited river reach. Collections
by Warren and Burr (1990) both upstream and
<br>downstream of these localities did not reveal the species. Judging
from their efforts and those of past surveys, the palezone
<br>shiner occurs in greatest abundance from the lowermost reaches of Estill
Fork and downstream about 2 to 3 river miles.
<p>The Cove Creek record is based on a single specimen collected by A.
R. Cahn on November 21, 1936 (examined by Starnes
<br>and Etnier 1980 and Warren et al. 1994). Cove Creek is now impounded
by Norris Dam to a depth of about 20 feet from the
<br>mouth upstream to the base of Cove Lake dam. Above Cove Lake, the creek
is small and full of silt, and attempts to recollect
<br>the species in the drainage have been unsuccessful (D. A. Etnier, in
litt. to R. E. Jenkins, July 16, 1968). The unimpounded
<br>headwaters of Cove Creek continue to be heavily impacted by surface
mine runoff (C. Saylor, Tennessee Valley Authority,
<br>personal communication).
<p>As judged from extensive collection efforts by numerous individuals
within the Tennessee and Cumberland River systems, it is
<br>believed that this fish is now restricted to two small river systems,
LSFCR and PRR. Both of which represent remnants of lotic
<br>systems that at least until recently retained physical and biotic characteristics
exemplary of the pre-historical norm (Warren and
<br>Burr 1990).
<p>REPRODUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT: There is little no published information
on reproduction in the palezone shiner
<br>(Warren et al. 1994) (see Raney [1947] for possible relevant breeding
behavior in N. procne).
<p>Observations by Warren and Burr (1990) show that males and females mature
at about 35 to 40 mm SL. Tubercles are
<br>developed on breeding males by mid-May, and peak spawning condition
apparently occurs in June but may last into early July;
<br>testes are not fully developed until June and are latent by early August
concomitant with loss or reduction of tubercles. Females
<br>captured in mid-May through late June have extended abdomens and possess
large, cream to yellow-colored ova; by early
<br>August, ovaries are transparent, and most ova are small and white to
translucent. These observations suggest a spawning
<br>period from late-May through June and perhaps early July. Other aspects
of spawning behavior are unknown.
<p>HABITAT: The palezone shiner occurs in flowing pools and runs of upland
streams that have permanent flow; clean, clear
<br>water; and substrates of bedrock, cobble, pebble, and gravel mixed
with clean sand (Starnes and Etnier 1980, Branson and
<br>Schuster 1982, Burr and Warren 1986, and Ramsey 1986). In May of 1990,
Warren and Burr (1990) found the palezone
<br>shiner in the Paint Rock River (PRR) in slow to moderately flowing
pools (60 to 75 cm in depth) over substrates of mixed
<br>sand, gravel, and cobble. In June of 1990, they collected it (apparently
in schools) in Little South Fork of the Cumberland
<br>River (LSFCR) from shallow (30 to 45 cm in depth), flowing pools underlain
by fractured bedrock and scattered patches of
<br>fine gravel. In August of 1990, they collected specimens in the LSFCR
from flowing areas ranging in velocity from 0.6 to 4.5
<br>cm/sec and a mean depth of 59 cm. Substrate varied from sand mixed
with fine and coarse gravel to bedrock.
<p>Presently little is known of the ecology of the palezone shiner, other
than its affinity for clean, clear, flowing large creeks and
<br>small rivers (Warren and Burr 1990). The species is associated most
frequently with other shiners in both LSFCR and PRR
<br>including: Cyprinella galactura, Luxilus chrysocephalus, Lythrurus
ardens, Notropis boops (PRR only), N. telescopus, N.
<br>rubellus, N. volucellus (LSFCR only), and the sawfin shiner, N. sp.
cf. spectrunculus. Collections examined contain at least
<br>three distinct size classes and suggest a longevity of 3 (or perhaps
4) years. The species' food habits are unknown.
<p>REASONS FOR CURRENT STATUS: Three of the four known localities for the
palezone shiner (except Marrowbone
<br>Creek) and both extant populations (LSFCR and PRR) occur in streams
on the periphery of the Cumberland Plateau. The
<br>distribution of the palezone shiner implies that the two remaining
populations are remnants of a once more widespread
<br>distribution (Starnes and Etnier 1986). Thus, two alternate, but not
mutually exclusive, explanations may be relevant concerning
<br>the highly fragmented range of the palezone shiner: (1) the species
is relatively ancient and extirpation has occurred
<br>prehistorically over much of its range, or (2) the extirpation of populations
over much of the range has occurred in historic times
<br>as a result of loss or degradation of appropriate habitat from siltation,
inadequate in-stream flow, reservoir construction,
<br>channelization, and coal-mining runoff (Warren and Burr 1990).
<p>The elimination of the species from the Cove Creek drainage within recent
times is exemplary of the effect of reservoir
<br>construction and coal-mining pollution on an obligate, stream species
(Starnes and Etnier 1980). Unfortunately, lack of
<br>extensive preimpoundment surveys in both the Tennessee and Cumberland
river systems precludes assessment of the historical
<br>distribution of the palezone shiner, but loss of other species as a
result of impoundments in these systems is well documented.
<br>(Etnier et al. 1979).
<p>The lower portions of most large tributaries in both the Tennessee and
Cumberland rivers are embayed, eliminating habitat
<br>transitional between that of small streams and large rivers. Reservoirs
also effectively eliminate migration by obligate stream
<br>fishes from one tributary to another, precluding natural colonization
of potentially suitable streams by the palezone shiner
<br>(Warren and Burr 1990). The mouth of LSFCR is embayed by Cumberland
Reservoir and PRR by Wheeler Reservoir.
<p>Marrowbone Creek empties into the Cumberland River below Wolf Creek
Dam. The dam discharge consists of extremely
<br>cold, hypolimnetic waters from Cumberland Reservoir which effectively
impounds lower reaches of the creek depending on the
<br>extent and duration of release schedules. Personal collecting in the
mainstem Cumberland (and lowermost reaches of
<br>tributaries) at and well below the dam indicates a depauperate native
ichthyofauna (Warren and Cicerello 1983), primarily a
<br>function of the cold dam releases and irregular water-level fluctuations.
Other probable historic reasons that may have restricted
<br>the distribution of the palezone shiner include: removal of shade-producing
riparian vegetation and concomitant increase in
<br>maximum stream temperatures; channelization; increased siltation associated
with poor agricultural and mining practices;
<br>deforestation of watersheds and concomitant decreases in in-stream
low flow; and perhaps pesticide runoff (Warren and Burr
<br>1990).
<p>Since about 1980, the lower third of LSFCR (about 15 River Miles) has
been periodically subjected to toxic surface mine
<br>runoff (especially, elevated heavy metal concentrations) that all but
eliminated the mussel fauna from the lower third of the river
<br>(Anderson 1989). The impact of the discharge on the palezone shiner
within this reach of the river is unknown, but recent
<br>(1990) sampling in this reach (Warren and Burr 1990) compared to past
efforts (Harker et al. 1979, 1980, Branson and
<br>Schuster 1982) indicate the benthic fish community, both in terms of
diversity and numbers of individuals, has been severely
<br>reduced, a probable result of direct mortality of adults and/or eggs,
larvae, and juveniles. Warren and Burr (1990) concurred
<br>with Anderson (1989) who concluded that current surface mine regulations
are inadequate to protect the mussel fauna of the
<br>LSFCR, and add that, if the toxic discharge is not curtailed, much
of the aquatic fauna of the LSFCR, including the palezone
<br>shiner, is imperiled. Upstream of the area receiving toxic mine discharge
in LSFCR, the primary threats to the palezone shiner
<br>are brine discharges from oil wells (Harker et al. 1979, 1980) and
poor land-use practices associated with increased siltation of
<br>the stream (road building, deforestation, destruction of riparian buffer
strips) (Warren and Burr 1990).
<p>Within the PRR the continued existence of the species will depend upon
the continued high-water quality present from about
<br>Princeton, Alabama, upstream. The limited distribution of the species
within the PRR definitely appears correlated with
<br>increasing agriculture and associated increase in stream siltation
in the reaches below Princeton. Ramsey (1986) noted that the
<br>Paint Rock River was channelized by the Army Corp of Engineers in 1966
(project initiated 1962, completed 1966,
<p>T. S. Jandebuer, Athens College, Athens, Alabama, personal communication),
but the impacts on the palezone shiner are
<br>unknown because no surveys were conducted prior to channelization.
<p>Because the existing palezone shiner populations inhabit short river
reaches, they are vulnerable to extirpation from accidental
<br>toxic chemical spills. Because of the palezone's relatively short lifespan,
the species is extremely vulnerable to short-term and/or
<br>localized habitat alterations. In addition, as the populated stream
reaches are isolated from each other and from any potential
<br>unoccupied habitat by impoundments, recolonization of any extirpated
population would not be possible without human
<br>intervention. Absence of natural gene flow between palezone populations
leaves the long-term genetic viability of these isolated
<br>populations in question.
<p>MANAGEMENT AND PROTECTION: To save the palezone shiner, all existing
State and Federal legislation and
<br>regulations must be enforced (especially those related to the impacts
of coal mining). Palezone shiner research needs include:
<br>life history information (spawning season and behavior, habitat requirements,
age and growth, and food habits); propagation
<br>and reintroduction techniques; and habitat improvement techniques.
Management needs include: reestablishing other spawning
<br>populations; promoting the safe use of pesticides by local farmers;
enforcing existing Federal and State laws relating to water
<br>quality; and monitoring the species especially at spawning areas. Additionally,
management is needed to restore some of the
<br>species habitat through repair of riparian habitat and control of nonpoint
source pollution.
