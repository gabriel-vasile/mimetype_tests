<H1>FEDSCREEK SERIES</H1>
<BR>
The Fedscreek series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils formed in loamy colluvium weathered from sandstone, siltstone, and shale. Permeability is moderately rapid. These soils are on hill slopes, mountain sides, benches, foot slopes, and in drainage ways. Slope ranges from 8 to 90 percent, but are dominantly 25 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 43 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F. <P>

Structure is weak or moderate fine through coarse subangular blocky or angular blocky. Some pedons have lithochromic mottles in shades of brown, yellow, or red and in the lower part shades of gray. Thin clay or silt coatings are not present in all pedons. <P>
	The C horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 8. fine-earth texture is sandy loam, loam, clay loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam. Some pedons have lithochromic mottles in shades of brown, yellow, red, or gray. Thin clay or silt coatings are not present in all pedons. A thin Cr horizon is present in some pedons.<P>
	The R horizon is interbedded sandstone or siltstone and less commonly shale. <P>

<A HREF="http://www2.ftw.nrcs.usda.gov/osd/dat/T/TIPSAW.html">Tipsaw</A> series. The Bannertown, Devotion, Ditney, Marrowbone, Mine Run and Tipsaw series are moderately deep over bedrock. Bannertown soils are somewhat excessively drained and formed in residuum weathered form felsic metamorphic or igneous parent materials. Cheshire soils formed in supraglacial till on uplands. Devotion soils formed in residuum weathered from felsic to intermediate metamorphic or igneous rock with paralithic contact. Ditney soils formed in residuum affected by soil creep that weathered from metasedimentary rock such as arkose, metagraywacke, metasandstone or quartzite. Marrowbone soils formed in residuum weathered from interbedded sandstone and siltstone. Maymead soils formed in colluvium deposited by local alluvium and contain fragments of feldspathic quartzite, graywacke and arkosic sandstone. The tentative Mine Run Series is somewhat excessively drained and formed in residuum weathered from metamonzonite and gneiss. The Tipsaw series is exclusively over paralithic contact with moderately cemented sandstone interbedded with siltstone and shale. <P>
<B>GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:</B> Fedscreek soils are on hill slopes, mountain sides, benches, foot slopes and in drainage ways. They are most commonly on south and west facing slopes with warm aspect, but some areas are downslope from sandstone escarpments. Slopes are dominantly 25 to 75 percent, but range from 8 to 90 percent. These soils formed in loamy colluvium dominated by strongly acid through neutral Pennsylvanian aged sandstone, siltstone and shale. Elevation ranges from 600 to 4,000 feet and local relief differences ranges from 600 to 2,500 feet. Mean annual temperature ranges from 53 to 59 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 49 inches. <P>

<A HREF="http://www2.ftw.nrcs.usda.gov/osd/dat/S/SHELOCTA.html">Shelocta</A> series. Berks, Dekalb, Handshoe and Sharondale soils are loamy-skeletal; Gilpin, Jefferson, Kimper, Muskingum, Pineville, Rayne and Shelocta soils are fine-loamy; and Latham soils are fine. In addition, Gilpin, Jefferson, Latham, Pineville, Rayne and Shelocta soils have argillic horizons; Jefferson soils have mixed mineralogy; Kimper soils have dark surface layers; Sharondale soils have mollic surface layers; and Berks, Dekalb, Gilpin, Latham, Marrowbone and Muskingum soils are moderately deep to bedrock. <P>
<B>DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:</B> Well drained. Permeability is moderately rapid in the solum and moderate or moderately rapid in the substratum. Runoff is low in areas of less than 20 percent slope and medium above 20 percent. <P>
<B>USE AND VEGETATION:</B> Most areas are in secondary growth hardwood forest with mixed stands of white oak, American Beech, mockernut hickory, pignut hickory, black oak, sugar maple, sassafras, red maple, chestnut oak, Virginia pine, and flowering dogwood. Less sloping areas are used for pasture and as sites for houses or gardens. <P>
<B>DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:</B> Fedscreek soils are in the Allegheny-Cumberland Plateau of eastern Kentucky with possible similar areas in West Virginia, Virginia, and eastern Tennessee. The area is estimated to be of large extent, about 200,000 acres. <P>
<B>MLRA OFFICE RESPONSIBLE:</B> Lexington, Kentucky <P>
<B>SERIES ESTABLISHED:</B> Pike County, Kentucky; 1985. Source of the name is a small community in Pike County. <P>
<B>REMARKS:</B> Fedscreek soils were mostly mapped as Jefferson or Shelocta soils in the past. <BR>
Diagnostic horizons recognized in this pedon are: <BR>
Ochric epipedon - 0 to 4 inches (A). <BR>
