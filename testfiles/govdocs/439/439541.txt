MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER
Adopted:  May 3, 2007 Released:  May 4, 2007
By the Associate Chief, Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau:
I. INTRODUCTION
1. In this Order, we address a case referred to us for de novo review by the 800 MHz 
Transition Administrator, LLC (TA) involving the alleged failure by 800 MHz licensees Ron and Barbara 
Gossett (Gossetts) to perform under the terms of their Frequency Relocation Agreement (FRA) with 
Sprint Nextel Corporation (Sprint).  Based on our review of the record in this case, we find that the 
Gossetts have consistently failed to meet their obligation of good-faith participation in the rebanding 
process and have forfeited their right to retuning of their facilities at Sprint’s expense.  We therefore find 
that Sprint is not responsible for the cost of retuning this facility, and that the Gossetts must retune station 
WPEH654 at their own expense or cease operation and surrender their license. If the Gossetts fail to 
either retune their station or surrender their license, they must show cause why the Commission should 
not modify the license pursuant to Section 316 of the Communications Act by assigning new frequencies 
and terminating their right to operate on their current frequencies.1
II. BACKGROUND
2. The Gossetts are licensed under call sign WPEH654 for a single-site conventional 800 
MHz system in Nashville, Tennessee.  This station was scheduled for relocation in Wave 2, Stage 1 of the 
rebanding process.  During the negotiation period for this wave, the Gossetts refused to participate in 
negotiations with Sprint, causing the TA to place the parties in early mediation.2  In mediation, the 
Gossetts resisted efforts by the TA mediator to secure their participation.3  The mediator then 
recommended that the Commission require the Gossetts to either reband voluntarily under a proposal 
made by Sprint or be rebanded involuntarily without compensation.4  On June 29, 2006, shortly after the 
mediator’s recommendation, the Gossetts signed an FRA with Sprint in which they agreed to retune their
system by September 2006.5 However, the Gossetts failed to retune the system as required and proposed 
that Sprint do so instead.6 Sprint investigated this option but determined that the tower owner would not

allow access to the site because the Gossetts were in arrears on their lease.7 Sprint then proposed that the 
Gossets cancel their lease and offered to pay the fees for such cancellation.  The Gossets refused this 
offer.8
3. On November 10, 2006, the TA once again placed the parties into mediation at Sprint's 
request.9 The Gossetts refused to participate in the mediation and declined to file anything in the record.10  
On January 18, 2007, after over two months of continued non-cooperation by the Gossetts, the mediator 
forwarded the mediation record, along with an updated recommended resolution, to the Public Safety and 
Homeland Security Bureau.
4. Sprint contends the Gossetts have repeatedly breached their duty of good faith imposed 
by the Commission.  Sprint argues that during the negotiation and mediation period, the Gossetts withheld 
essential system information, failed to cooperate in negotiations and mediation, and refused to respond to 
Sprint’s repeated good-faith efforts to resolve this matter.11 Sprint contends that since the Gossetts signed 
the FRA, they have continued their pattern of non-cooperation by failing to implement the agreement, 
rejecting Sprint’s proposal to cancel their license, and failing to participate in further mediation.12
5. The TA mediator agrees with Sprint that the Gossetts have breached their duty of good 
faith.13 The mediator recommends that the Commission issue an order requiring the Gossetts to show 
cause why their license for call sign WPEH654 should not be cancelled as a result of their failure to 
negotiate or participate in mediation in good faith.14
III. DISCUSSION
6. Based on the record before us, we find that the Gossetts have breached their duty of good 
faith as defined by the Commission’s orders in this proceeding.  The Commission stated explicitly that 
although it could not predict what “good faith” may be for all parties in all circumstances, it envisioned 
that it extends to making a counteroffer to a reasonable offer, rather than refusing an offer outright15  The 
record is clear that they have repeatedly failed to respond to requests to provide information, have not 
responded to good faith negotiation offers by Sprint, and have failed to cooperate in the mediation 
process.  This complete absence of cooperation and responsiveness is sufficient by itself to support a

Reconsideration, 19 FCC Rcd 25120, 25153 ¶ 73 (2004) (800 MHz Supplemental Order); see also Improving Public 
Safety Communications in the 800 MHz Band, Report and Order, Fifth Report and Order, Fourth Memorandum 
Opinion and Order, and Order, 19 FCC Rcd 14969, 15076, n.524 (2004) as amended by Erratum, 19 FCC Rcd 
19651 (2004), and Erratum, 19 FCC Rcd 21818 (2004)( Among the factors relevant to a good-faith determination 
are: (1) whether the party responsible for paying the cost of band reconfiguration has made a bona fide offer to 
relocate the incumbent to comparable facilities; (2) the steps the parties have taken to determine the actual cost of 
relocation to comparable facilities; and (3) whether either party has unreasonably withheld information, essential to 
the accurate estimation of relocation costs and procedures, requested by the other party).

finding that the Gossetts are not entitled to recovery of any of their retuning costs from Sprint.  Moreover, 
the Gossetts’ continued pattern of non-cooperation threatens to impede the rebanding process.  
Reconfiguration of the 800 MHz band is of imperative importance and we will not allow it to be 
threatened by intransigent licensees.  Therefore, we require the Gossetts, at their own expense, to retune 
station WPEH654 to the frequencies specified by the TA and to complete such retuning within thirty days 
of the release date of this Order.  Alternatively, the Gossetts shall cease operation and surrender their 
license within thirty days of the release date of this Order.  
7. If the Gossetts fail to abide by the terms of this Order, because such action would threaten 
public safety communication, we propose, pursuant to Section 316(a) of the Communications Act, 47 
U.S.C. §316(a) to modify the license of station WPEH654 to authorize it to operate on the replacement 
channels designated for it by the TA and to remove their authorization to operate on their current 
frequencies.  Pursuant to Section 316(b) of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. §316(b), and Section 
1.87(c) of the Commission’s rules, 47 C.F.R. §1.87(c), we afford the Gossetts and any other similarly 
affected licensees and opportunity to protest this proposed modification.  Because the proposed 
modification to WPEH654 involves the safety of life and property, we require the Gossetts to file any 
protest within forty days of the release date of this Order.
