ORDER OF MODIFICATION
 Adopted:  September 26, 2007 Released:  September 27, 2007
By the Associate Chief, Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau:
1. Introduction. In this Order, we delete mobile and base station frequencies from the 
license for call sign WPEH654, a single-site 800 MHz conventional Specialized Mobile Radio system in 
Nashville, Tennessee licensed to Ron and Barbara Gossett (Gossetts), thereby terminating the Gossetts’ 
right to operate on these frequencies. We take this license modification action pursuant to our earlier 
order regarding the disposition of the Gossetts’ license in the 800 MHz rebanding process.1
2. Background.  In our May 4, 2007, Memorandum Opinion and Order (MO&O) in this 
matter, we addressed the failure by the Gossetts to participate in the rebanding process under the terms of 
their Frequency Reconfiguration Agreement (FRA) with Sprint Nextel Corporation (Sprint).  We found 
that the Gossetts failed to meet their obligation of good-faith participation in the rebanding process and 
forfeited their right to retuning of their facility at Sprint’s expense.2 We therefore held that Sprint was not 
responsible for the cost of retuning this facility, and ordered the Gossetts to either retune station 
WPEH654 at their own expense or cease operation and surrender their license.3 We required the Gossetts 
to comply with these terms within thirty days of the release of the MO&O (i.e. June 4, 2007).4
3. In the MO&O, we also stipulated that if the Gossetts failed to either retune their station or 
surrender their license, they must show cause why the Commission should not modify their license by 
terminating their right to operate on their pre-rebanding frequencies.5 Because the proposed modification 
to WPEH654 involves the safety of life and property, we required the Gossetts to file any protest within 
forty days of the release date of the MO&O.6 Otherwise, we stated, the Gossetts would be deemed to 
have consented to modification of their license as proposed in the MO&O, and a final Order would be 
issued if the modification were found to be in the public interest.7
4. Discussion.  A copy of the MO&O was sent to the Gossetts by certified mail. To date, the

4 Id.  Because the thirtieth day after the release of the MO&O fell on a Sunday (June 3, 2007), the thirty day deadline 
fell on the next business day, Monday, June 4, 2007.

Gossetts have not surrendered their license nor have they retuned their facility as directed by the MO&O.  
The Gossetts also did not protest the proposed modification of their license within the requisite time 
frame.  Therefore, as provided in the MO&O, we find that the Gossetts have consented to the proposed 
deletion of pre-rebanding frequencies from their license. Based on the record in this matter, we conclude 
that it is in the public interest to modify the license for Station WPEH654 by deleting mobile-only 
frequencies 806-821 MHz and base station frequency 852.1875 MHz, thereby terminating the Gossetts’ 
right to operate on these frequencies.8
5. ACCORDINGLY, IT IS ORDERED, pursuant to Sections 4(i) and 316(a) of the 
Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. §§ 154(i), 316(a), and Section 1.87 of the 
Commission's Rules, 47 C.F.R. § 1.87, that the license for WPEH654 Services Station WPEH654, 
Nashville, Tennessee, held by Ron and Barbara Gossett, IS MODIFIED by deleting frequency pair mobile 
only frequencies 806-821 MHz and base station frequency 852.1875 MHz, effective thirty days from the 
release date of this Order of Modification.
6. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED, that a copy of this Order of Modification shall be sent 
BY CERTIFIED MAIL, RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED, to the following:
Ron and Barbara Gossett

Commission's Rules, 47 C.F.R. §§ 0.191, 0.392.

8 In the MO&O, we proposed that if the Gossetts failed to either retune their station at their own expense or 
surrender their license, we would “modify the license of station WPEH654 to authorize it to operate on the 
replacement channels designated for it by the TA and to remove their authorization to operate on their current 
frequencies.”  See MO&O, 22 FCC Rcd at 8524 ¶ 7.  In fact, the WPEH654 station license had already been 
modified to authorize the Gossetts to operate on replacement channels designated by the Transition Administrator, 
but their authorization to operate on the original frequencies has continued in effect until now. See FCC File No. 
0002668534 (filed June 30, 2006). We note that since we issued the MO&O, the WPEH654 replacement channels 
have been designated for termination for failure to certify timely construction.  See Wireless Telecommunications 
Bureau Site Based Licenses Termination Public Notice, Report No. 3447 at 3 (Sept. 12, 2007).  Our deletion of pre-
rebanding frequencies from station WPEH654 in this Order does not give the Gossetts any new rights with respect 
to the replacement channels or otherwise extend the applicable construction deadline.
