<h1>Washington Department of Social and Health Services, DAB No. 282 (1982) </h1>
<p>GAB Decision 282</p>
<p>April 23, 1982 Washington Department of Social and Health Services;<br>
  Docket No. 81-44-WA-HC Garrett, Donald; Settle, Norval Teitz,<br>
  Alexander</p>
<p><br>
  The State of Washington Department of Social and Health Services<br>
  (State, DSHS) appealed the disallowance of $999,711 in federal financial<br>
  participation (FFP) by the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA,<br>
  Agency). The disallowance was for FFP in expenditures for four<br>
  Intermediate Care Facilities for the Mentally Retarded (ICF/MRs) during<br>
  periods when the Agency claimed no valid provider agreements existed for<br>
  these facilities. These periods were between the July 18, 1977<br>
  effective date for ICF/MR services in the Grantee's State plan and the<br>
  respective dates on which the Agency claimed the individual facilities<br>
  were certified.</p>
<p> The four ICF/MRs, all State-owned, are Rainier, Lakeland, Fircrest,<br>
  and Frances Hadden Morgan Center (FHMC). Two of the facilities, Rainier<br>
  and Lakeland, were the subjects of prior appeals by the State which were<br>
  decided by this Board in Decision No. 176, May 26, 1981. /1/</p>
<p><br>
  Our decision in this appeal is based on briefs and submissions of the<br>
  parties; the response of the parties to an Order to Develop the Record;<br>
  the transcript of a hearing held in Washington, D.C.; and the record of<br>
  the appeals in Decision No. 176, which was incorporated in this case by<br>
  agreement of the parties.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p> Under applicable regulations, in order for a state to obtain FFP for<br>
  payments for Medicaid patients in an ICF or SNF, there must be a valid<br>
  provider agreement. This is an agreement between the single state<br>
  agency (designated by the state to administer or supervise the<br>
  administration of the state Medicaid plan) and the facility. Before a<br>
  provider agreement can be valid, the state (2) survey agency (ordinarily<br>
  the state authority which licenses health facilities) must certify the<br>
  facility. A facility may be certified with defects provided (1) the<br>
  survey agency finds that the deficiencies do not jeopardize the health<br>
  and safety of the patients, and (2) the state survey agency accepts a<br>
  plan of correction or a waiver has been granted. There may be a plan of<br>
  correction as to some requirements and a waiver as to others.</p>
<p> The plan of correction not only lists the deficiencies found but also<br>
  sets up a plan for correcting them within a definite time schedule. If<br>
  the state survey agency finds the plan of correction to be acceptable,<br>
  it then certifies the facility on a Certification and Transmittal form<br>
  (Form 1539, C&amp;T). The last item to be completed by the state survey<br>
  agency is Line 18, state survey agency approval, with space for a<br>
  signature, and the title of the person signing. Line 19 has space for<br>
  the date of the state survey agency approval to the right of the<br>
  signature on Line 18. There is a separate line (11) for the period of<br>
  certification. The single state agency enters into the provider<br>
  agreement with the facility based upon the certification. The provider<br>
  agreement may have its effective date backdated, but no earlier than the<br>
  date of certification. See, generally, 42 CFR Part 449 (1977); 42 CFR<br>
  Part 442 (1978) (relevant provisions are quoted below).</p>
<p>Statement of Facts</p>
<p> In Washington the Health Services Division has the responsibility for<br>
  certifying ICF/MR facilities under applicable federal regulations for<br>
  Medicaid. The disallowance letter gives the following pertinent dates<br>
  for the various facilities, which were not disputed by the State:</p>
<p> Survey Plan of C&amp;T CompletedCorrection<br>
  Accepted Excuted Rainier 6/10/77 4/26/78<br>
  4/27/78 Lakeland 5/17/77 9/16/77 11/18/77 Fircrest<br>
  5/6/77 11/18/77 11/18/77 FHMC 5/11/77<br>
  10/8/77 11/30/77</p>
<p><br>
  In addition, the provider agreements all stated they were effective<br>
  July 18, 1977, /2/ and the State claimed FFP for ICF/MR services<br>
  beginning with that date.</p>
<p><br>
  (3)</p>
<p> The State's position was based on two principal grounds. The first<br>
  was that HCFA had interpreted the relevant regulations, 42 CFR 442.12(<br>
  a) and (b), &quot;in an invalid manner, under law.&quot; The State disputed 
  HCFA's<br>
  interpretation of the date of certification as effective when the C&amp;T<br>
  form is executed by the state survey agency. The State further claimed<br>
  that 45 CFR 249.33(a)(8) allowed for the type of action taken by the<br>
  State, that its surveys were completed in advance of July 18, 1977 for<br>
  each facility, and that its activities fell within the exceptions in the<br>
  regulations mentioned above. (Appeal, p. 2)</p>
<p> The second major ground for the State's appeal was that of equitable<br>
  estoppel. The State claimed that it was informed by the Agency that<br>
  certification would be effective as of the date of the initial survey if<br>
  the facility was found &quot;in substantial compliance to be certified.&quot;<br>
  (Id.) The State offered affidavits and oral testimony at the hearing in<br>
  support of its position.</p>
<p>Pertinent Regulations</p>
<p> 42 CFR 442.12 (1978) provides as follows:</p>
<p> (a) A medicaid agency may not execute a provider agreement with a<br>
  facility for... ICF services nor make medicaid payments to a facility<br>
  for those services unless... the State survey agency has certified the<br>
  facility under this part to provide those services....</p>
<p> (b) The effective date of an agreement may not be earlier than the<br>
  date of certification.</p>
<p> For part of the period of this disallowance a similar earlier<br>
  regulation was in effect. 42 CFR 449.33(a)(6) (1977) required that a<br>
  state plan for medical assistance under Title XIX must provide:</p>
<p> that execution of the single State agency provider agreement with a<br>
  facility for payments under the plan shall be contingent upon<br>
  certification....</p>
<p> The State in its appeal and in its response to the Board's Order to<br>
  Develop the Record refers also to 45 CFR 249.33(a)(8). In the October<br>
  1, 1976 codification this required that a state plan provide:</p>
<p> during the period ending three years after the effective date of<br>
  section 249.13 that in the case of an institution... for the mentally<br>
  retarded... the single State agency will:</p>
<p> (4) (i) Prior to the execution of a provider agreement covering<br>
  intermediate care facility services, where the institution is not in<br>
  compliance with the standards specified in Sec. 249.13, obtain a written<br>
  plan of compliance which shall be submitted... by the institution to the<br>
  single State agency and approved by the Secretary, for achieving<br>
  conformity with the standards specified in Sec. 249.13. The plan of<br>
  compliance shall:</p>
<p> (A) Detail the extent of the institution's current compliance with<br>
  the standards prescribed in Sec. 249.13, and the specific action steps<br>
  required to achieve compliance with the standards...</p>
<p> * * *</p>
<p> (C) In the case of a public institution... for the mentally<br>
  retarded... provide for approval of the plan of compliance by the<br>
  State....</p>
<p> The history of section 249.33(a)(8) and its varying effective dates,<br>
  and its relation to this case, are discussed in the analysis below.</p>
<p>Discussion</p>
<p>I. Date of certification</p>
<p> The parties here continued to rely on the same arguments about the<br>
  date of certification that they relied on in the earlier Washington<br>
  Department of Social and Health Services cases decided in Decision 176.<br>
  The Agency continued to take the position that under 42 CFR 442.12(a)<br>
  and (b) the effective date of certification could never be earlier than<br>
  the date of execution of the C&amp;T form by the state survey agency. The<br>
  State claimed this was an invalid interpretation. It again claimed that<br>
  it had relied on the information given it, that certification could<br>
  occur as of the date of the survey, if the survey disclosed that the<br>
  facility in question was then in substantial compliance with the federal<br>
  regulatory requirements.The estoppel claim is considered separately<br>
  below. On the issue of the date of certification, apart from the<br>
  possible effect of any estoppel, the Board here repeats its conclusion<br>
  in Decision No. 176, for the reasons there given, that the date of<br>
  certification may be earlier than the date of execution of the C&amp;T form,<br>
  but only under certain specified conditions. It therefore becomes<br>
  necessary to consider the factual situation for the two facilities not<br>
  involved in Decision No. 176, namely, Fircrest and FHMC. For Rainier<br>
  and Lakeland, the Board makes the same findings (5) as in Decision No.<br>
  176. /3/ The date of certification for Rainier School was April 27,<br>
  1981, the same date the C&amp;T form was signed. For Lakeland School the<br>
  date of certification was November 17, 1977, one day before the November<br>
  18 date of execution of the C&amp;T.</p>
<p><br>
  A. Fircrest</p>
<p> The C&amp;T form for Firecrest was not signed until November 18, 1977.<br>
  From the disallowance letter it appeared that the date of the acceptance<br>
  of the plan of correction for Fircrest was that same day. In its Order<br>
  to Develop the Record the Board requested the State to submit any<br>
  evidence it might have why the date of execution of the C&amp;T form should<br>
  therefore not be accepted as the date of certification. In its response<br>
  the State repeated and elaborated on its arguments under 45 CFR<br>
  249.33(a)(8) and on equitable estoppel generally. It did not, however,<br>
  specifically address the question raised by the Board. The Board<br>
  therefore finds, based on Decision No. 176 and in the absence of<br>
  anything further offered to the contrary, that the date of certification<br>
  could not be earlier than the date of acceptance of a plan of<br>
  correction; in the case of Fircrest, this was November 18, 1977, the<br>
  same date the C&amp;T was signed.</p>
<p> B.FHMC</p>
<p> The disallowance letter indicates that the plan of correction for<br>
  this facility was accepted on October 8, 1977 but the C&amp;T form was not<br>
  signed until November 30, 1977. The parties were therefore asked to<br>
  furnish all documentation partaining to the survey and certification of<br>
  this facility, to see if there was any explanation for the delay.</p>
<p> The State submitted the C&amp;T form for FHMC as well as the complete<br>
  statement of deficiencies and plan of correction. It also submitted a<br>
  sheet listing this facility and many others, giving various dates, (6)<br>
  but not otherwise identified. This gave for FHMC (here identified as<br>
  Frances H.M.C.C.) a date of 5-11-77 for the inspection, and 8-5-77 for<br>
  the correction plan. The column (F) for &quot;Final Accept of POC&quot; bears 
  two<br>
  dates: &quot;9-22-77 (health)&quot; and &quot;10-8-77 (fire).&quot; (See, also 
  Tr. p. 99)</p>
<p> The C&amp;T form is not particularly illuminating.It indicates that the<br>
  period of certification was to begin on 7/18/77. The certification was<br>
  signed on 11/30/77 by John Gerth, giving state survey agency approval.<br>
  The form states compliance is based on an acceptable plan of correction,<br>
  and approved waivers of the requirements of the Life Safety Code and<br>
  number of beds per room. The plan of correction consists of some 21<br>
  pages. Many of the items seem minor and have a proposed completion date<br>
  of either July 1 or December 1, 1977. Waivers were requested for the<br>
  following items: use of one-way mirrors in rooms A &amp; B; enlarging a<br>
  doorway; and simultaneous audible-visible warning signals. In<br>
  addition, capital budget requests were to be submitted to DSHS and the<br>
  State Legislature for funds to divide a long corridor into shorter<br>
  sections by smoke barriers; to widen resident rooms; and to install<br>
  electric hold open devices connected to the fire alarm system. These<br>
  items were given a completion date of July 1, 1980, and, in the only one<br>
  of these where a date was given for submitting the capital budget<br>
  request to the State Legislature, it was January 1978. A waiver or<br>
  &quot;variance&quot; was also requested from the requirement that bedrooms should<br>
  accommodate no more than four residents.</p>
<p> The Agency's response to the Order included the same November 17,<br>
  1977 memorandum from the Deputy Director of the Bureau of Developmental<br>
  Disabilities (BDD) to John Gerth, head of the state survey agency, which<br>
  was in the record in the prior Washington appeals. This indicated that<br>
  while all areas of concern regarding the availability of funds for<br>
  Fircrest and Lakeland had been answered in discussions that day, Gerth<br>
  still had a question regarding FHMC. The memorandum indicated that if<br>
  there was no additional funding through an appropriation at the<br>
  supplemental session of the legislature, the deficiencies for Fircrest<br>
  and FHMC would require funding from &quot;Bill Leonard/Omnibus Act.&quot; The<br>
  significance of this document is that, as pointed out for similar<br>
  correspondence in Decision No. 176 (p. 6), the head of the survey agency<br>
  could not possibly have certified FHMC on October 8, 1977 (when the plan<br>
  of correction was accepted), when on November 17 he was still talking<br>
  about funding. Decision No. 176 also sets out (at p. 6) part of a<br>
  memorandum from Gerth to Norm Davis (Assistant Director, Planning and<br>
  Support Services, BDD, October 6, 1977) pertaining to Lakeland and<br>
  Fircrest School, which states that the State officials had received<br>
  information from &quot;our federal counterparts&quot; that a written commitment<br>
  that funds are available for correction of deficiencies &quot;is required<br>
  prior to certification of state operated institutions.&quot;</p>
<p> (7) Again, as in Decision No. 176, the Agency submission which<br>
  explained the gap between the date of acceptance of the plan of<br>
  correction and the date the C&amp;T was signed for FHMC was an approval of<br>
  the waiver requests.</p>
<p> It was not until November 30, 1977 that Gerth granted the waiver<br>
  requests. In his memorandum of that date to Norm Davis he refers to the<br>
  waivers requested in the &quot;fire survey report dated June 14, 1977&quot; 
  and in<br>
  the &quot;health survey report dated May 11, 1977.&quot; The Board, under the<br>
  reasoning of Decision No. 176, cannot say that all the necessary<br>
  requirements for certification were met until these waivers were<br>
  granted. Since the date of these waivers, November 30, 1977, is the<br>
  same day that the C&amp;T form for FHMC was signed, we are not faced with<br>
  any consideration of notification of the state survey agency in advance<br>
  of the signing of the C&amp;T. Based on Decision No. 176, the Board finds<br>
  that the date of certification of FHMC was November 30, 1977.</p>
<p>II. Estoppel</p>
<p> In this case the State articulated its equitable estoppel argument<br>
  more clearly than in the earlier Washington cases, and also presented<br>
  oral testimony at the hearing, where only affidavits were available for<br>
  Decision No. 176. Unfortunately, the exact details of a conversation or<br>
  meeting, as recalled some three or four years later, cannot be expected<br>
  to be fresh in the witnesses' memories, so some inconsistencies and<br>
  contributions can be expected, even from witnesses trying to tell the<br>
  truth. /4/</p>
<p><br>
  As in Decision No. 176, the Board does not believe that it is<br>
  necessary to reach the legal issue of whether the federal government can<br>
  be estopped by misrepresentations of an employee. The State's claim, as<br>
  in Decision No. 176, is in substance that the head of its survey agency<br>
  was told that the date of certification could be earlier than the date<br>
  of signing of the C&amp;T. In fact, the representation was claimed to be<br>
  that the date of certification could be backdated to the last day of the<br>
  survey, where either all requirements were then met, or there was an<br>
  acceptable plan of correction which did not require that additional<br>
  corrections be accomplished before certification. However, even if this<br>
  was all represented by someone with authority to do so, it would make no<br>
  difference in the result because one important factor was not<br>
  considered. Where a waiver of a specific requirement was requested (8)<br>
  from the survey agency, the certification could not be complete until<br>
  the waiver request was granted. However, in view of the substantial<br>
  amounts of money involved, and the effort and expense by the State, the<br>
  Board will briefly review the relevant testimony.</p>
<p> The first witness for the State was Norm Davis, who at the time<br>
  covered by the disallowance was Assistant Director of BDD. He testified<br>
  on direct examination that the surveys were done in the spring of 1977,<br>
  and then there were continuing discussions with John Gerth, head of the<br>
  State survey agency, &quot;about how to complete plans of compliance or plans<br>
  of correction.&quot; (Tr. p. 28) He had no direct conversation about the date<br>
  of certification question with John McFadden, the federal employee on<br>
  whose statements the State relies primarily for its estoppel claim. /5/<br>
  Davis stated that he was in John Gerth's office when Gerth spoke to John<br>
  McFadden, and he (Davis) got the impression from Gerth that McFadden had<br>
  said the effective date for FFP was the date of survey. This of course<br>
  cannot be of much evidentiary value alone, a witness giving his idea of<br>
  what someone else's conversation was. (Tr. pp. 31-32) In fact, Gerth<br>
  testified that he did not recall Davis being with him when he had the<br>
  particular conversation with McFadden, and that Davis had testified to<br>
  another conversation which he, Gerth, did not recall. (Tr. pp. 94-95)</p>
<p><br>
  Alberta Larsen's testimony on the McFadden conversation with Gerth<br>
  was similar to that of Davis. She said that she was in Gerth's office<br>
  with Davis when Gerth called McFadden, and after the phone conversation<br>
  was ended, Gerth reassured her and Davis that they could certify back to<br>
  the date of the survey.</p>
<p> So, as in Decision No. 176, John Gerth was the only State employee<br>
  who had first-hand knowledge of what McFadden said about certification<br>
  dates in reference to surveys. The substance of Gerth's testimony on<br>
  this point is that McFadden told him that certification of a facility<br>
  could be backdated to the last day of the survey under certain<br>
  circumstances. This was where the facility had an acceptable plan of<br>
  correction, and the deficiencies were not such that additional<br>
  corrections had to be made before certification (9) would be considered.<br>
  The reason for not certifying would be if there was jeopardy to the<br>
  health and safety of the patients. (Tr. p. 98)</p>
<p> The Board considers the failure of John McFadden to appear and<br>
  testify to be significant. No explanation whatever was offered for his<br>
  absence. In fact the Agency attorney refers offhand to McFadden's<br>
  affidavit in Decision No. 176 as being very clear that &quot;he did not<br>
  attempt to interpret Medicaid policy for setting effective dates&quot;, and<br>
  this &quot;clearly contradicts the testimony that he did so here today.&quot; 
  The<br>
  attorney continued:</p>
<p> I just wanted to make that statement for the record, since Mr.<br>
  McFadden is not here. (Tr. pp. 170-171)</p>
<p> It was not reasonable to expect the Board to give substantial weight<br>
  to McFadden's affidavit without even mentioning some reason why he was<br>
  not present in person. It was obvious that McFadden's statements would<br>
  be critical. The State brought its witnesses some 3000 miles so they<br>
  could testify in person.The Agency brought witnesses who could testify<br>
  only to what happened after the periods of the disallowance but the<br>
  Agency could not bring McFadden or even explain his absence.</p>
<p> The Board would under the circumstances have had to infer that the<br>
  testimony of Mr. McFadden, if he had been present, would be unfavorable<br>
  to the Agency. /6/ However, that does not in and of itself add much to<br>
  the State's case. The Board in Decision No. 176 pointed out that it was<br>
  &quot;significant&quot; that McFadden did not in so many words deny saying<br>
  substantially what he is charged with saying, namely, that a C&amp;T form<br>
  could be dated back if the facility were in fact in compliance on an<br>
  earlier date, based on a survey and a plan of correction. (p. 10) Even<br>
  if McFadden said this, there remained the fact that if waivers were<br>
  requested for certain requirements, the particular facility could not be<br>
  certifiable until the waivers were granted.</p>
<p><br>
  The Board, as in Decision No. 176, does not believe that what<br>
  happened at the meeting on July 14, 1978 of State and HEW staff was<br>
  significant. This was all after the fact. The extensive testimony<br>
  about this meeting cannot help support the State's estoppel claim. The<br>
  last C&amp;T for these facilities was signed on April 27, 1978. Nothing<br>
  that anyone said in July 1978 could have caused the State to rely to its<br>
  detriment on the Agency (10) statements. Nothing at that date could<br>
  have caused the State to take its time in getting the C&amp;T forms signed.</p>
<p> On the underlying issue of applying equitable estoppel, the Supreme<br>
  Court has spoken recently, though none too clearly. In Schweiker v.<br>
  Hansen, 450 U.S. 785 (1981), a Social Security employee had not complied<br>
  with instructions in a claims manual, and in response to an oral inquiry<br>
  had erroneously told claimant that she was not entitled to Social<br>
  Security mother's insurance benefits. Claimant therefore did not file,<br>
  although filing was a prerequisite to obtaining benefits. The Court<br>
  summarily reversed a court of appeals finding for claimant on the ground<br>
  of estoppel.</p>
<p> The decision does not give clear guidance. The Court states that it:</p>
<p> has never decided what type of conduct by a Government employee will<br>
  estop the Government from insisting upon compliance with valid<br>
  regulations governing the distribution of welfare benefits... (p. 788)</p>
<p> In considering equitable estoppel generally, the Court suggests, as<br>
  the dissent states, that estoppel may be justified in some<br>
  circumstances, but this is not such a case. (pp. 791-792)</p>
<p> There are three elements mentioned in the majority opinion as<br>
  pertinent factors which may be relevant here. The Court discusses the<br>
  possibility of &quot;affirmative misconduct&quot; being a basis for estopping 
  the<br>
  federal government. The opinion also distinguishes cases where estoppel<br>
  &quot;did not threaten the public fisc.&quot; (n. 4) As the dissent points out 
  (p.<br>
  793), there is also in the decision (n. 4) an unclear distinction<br>
  between written statements and oral ones.</p>
<p> In the case before the Board we have no contention of &quot;affirmative<br>
  misconduct&quot; on the part of any government employee; applying estoppel<br>
  would certainly threaten the &quot;public fisc&quot;, to the tune of about a<br>
  million dollars; and the alleged misrepresentations were all oral.<br>
  Taking all these factors into consideration, if the issue were reached,<br>
  this would probably not be the case where equitable estoppel would be<br>
  applied.</p>
<p> The Board in Decision No. 176 stated why it was not necessary to<br>
  consider estoppel for Rainier and Lakeland Schools. If the Agency<br>
  representatives did in fact mislead the State into relying on the belief<br>
  that the date of execution of the C&amp;T form itself was not critical, we<br>
  still would not go back beyond the date of acceptance of a plan of<br>
  correction and an appropriate communication thereof. The regulatory<br>
  requirement for acceptance of a plan of correction is clear.</p>
<p> (11) The Board has said in Decision No. 176 that it will accept as<br>
  the date of certification of a facility a date prior to the date the C&amp;<br>
  T form is actually signed under certain conditions. These are: that an<br>
  actual written plan of correction of any deficiencies be accepted in<br>
  writing by the state survey agency, that all requirements for<br>
  certification have been met, and the state survey agency takes steps to<br>
  notify the facility or the single state agency in writing of its actual<br>
  determination of certification. Since the Board would go no further in<br>
  the case before us now even if it did accept the State's claim of<br>
  estoppel as meeting both the legal requirements and the elements of<br>
  proof required, the result would be the same.</p>
<p> Specifically, the plan of correction for Rainier School was not<br>
  accepted until April 26, 1978. Acceptance was not communicated before<br>
  the C&amp;T form was signed on April 27, so that is the earliest date the<br>
  provider agreement can be effective.</p>
<p> For Lakeland School, the plan of correction was accepted on September<br>
  16, 1977, but all requirements, both for funding and approval of a<br>
  waiver, were not met until November 17, 1977, when the facility was so<br>
  informed. Therefore the provider agreement is effective that day, even<br>
  though the C&amp;T form was not signed until the next day.</p>
<p> The same factors applied to the other two facilities, namely,<br>
  Fircrest and FHMC, as discussed in I. above. For Fircrest there is no<br>
  problem at all, since the date of acceptance of the plan of correction<br>
  was the very same day the C&amp;T form was signed. Even under estoppel, the<br>
  date of certification could therefore be no earlier than the date of<br>
  signing of the C&amp;T.</p>
<p> For FHMC there was a sizeable period between the date of acceptance<br>
  of a plan of correction and the signing of the C&amp;T. It appears,<br>
  however, that the final waiver necessary was not approved until the same<br>
  day the C&amp;T was signed. It would make no difference if estoppel were<br>
  considered as applicable against the federal government. All<br>
  requirements for certification were not met before then. The acceptance<br>
  of a plan of correction did not remove the requirement that all waiver<br>
  requests be approved before the facility was in fact certifiable. The<br>
  State knew that the requirement existed, and so could not have been<br>
  misled by any representation to the contrary. In fact, on the C&amp;T form<br>
  itself for FHMC, it appears that it was certified in compliance with<br>
  program requirements, and that compliance was based on both an<br>
  &quot;accetable P.O.C.&quot; and &quot;approved waivers&quot; of certain listed<br>
  requirements. Until the waivers were approved the facility could not be<br>
  certified.</p>
<p>(12) III. The ICF/MR regulations</p>
<p> The manner in which the State in its appeal relies on 45 CFR 249.33(<br>
  a)(8) requires explanation:</p>
<p> (A)n examination of 45 CFR 249.33(a)(8) allows for the type of action<br>
  taken by DSHS as it proceeded to request FFP for each of its facilities.<br>
  (Attention is invited to 42 Federal Register 15063-15064.) DSHS contends<br>
  that its surveys were completed in advance of 18 July 1977 for each of<br>
  the facilities for which FFP is claimed. In addition, the plan of<br>
  action for compliance with Federal standards of which the personnel of<br>
  HCFA had been advised had been in existence for some time previous to<br>
  that July 18, 1977 date. (Appeal, p. 2)</p>
<p> Immediately prior to this sentence on p. 2 of the appeal, the State<br>
  contended that:</p>
<p> its plan to achieve such compliance as may have been necessary<br>
  through the determination of deficiencies during the survey was known to<br>
  HCFA in advance of not only the July 18, 1977 date but the March 18,<br>
  1977 date.</p>
<p> This somewhat jumbled contention is expanded and partly clarified in<br>
  the State's Response to the Order to Develop the Record, where it is<br>
  treated as akin to an estoppel argument. What the State seems to be<br>
  saying is that it was the duty of the Agency to notify the State of any<br>
  change in pertinent federal regulations, and failure to do so is grounds<br>
  for reversing the disallowance.</p>
<p> To understand the background of this argument and the significance of<br>
  the particular dates it is necessary to examine in some detail the<br>
  history of the regulations on ICF/MR certification. The general<br>
  background is given in the commentary on a later regulation set out in<br>
  46 Fed. Reg. 1268 et seq., January 6, 1981. This points out that<br>
  Congress in 1972 passed legislation (Pub. L. 92-223) that provided for<br>
  the first time coverage under the Medicaid program for services in ICF/<br>
  MRs. It outlines the various regulations providing extensions of time<br>
  for achieving full compliance with the final standards, and the<br>
  different times allowed in plans of correction for completing required<br>
  improvements. We are concerned here only with the beginning of this<br>
  period, which started in 1974, and ran through July 17, 1977.</p>
<p> Final regulations were published on January 17, 1974, 39 Fed. Reg.<br>
  2220, to implement Pub. L. 92-223. The detailed standards for ICF/MRs<br>
  were set out in 45 CFR 249.13 to be effective not later than 3 years<br>
  after the effective date of the regulation. Since the effective date<br>
  was March 18, 1974, the latest date for compliance would be March 18,<br>
  1977. As this date approached it was found (13) that many facilities<br>
  would be unable to meet the deadline. In fact, a study showed that only<br>
  35% of state-owned facilities were expected to be in full compliance by<br>
  the date set. (See, 42 Fed. Reg. 3325, January 18, 1977) Accordingly,<br>
  on March 18, 1977 there was published an amendment to 249.33(a)(8) which<br>
  extended the regulation to July 18, 1977 for certification of an ICF/MR<br>
  with a plan of correction. Then on June 3, 1977 new regulations were<br>
  issued prescribing new procedures for certifying ICF/MRs, giving new<br>
  time limits for compliance for a facility certified with deficiencies,<br>
  and specifically revoking 249.33( a)(8).</p>
<p> The first complaint of the State is that 249.33(a)(8) was revoked<br>
  &quot;without prior notice.&quot; (State Response to Order to Develop the Record,<br>
  p. 2) It is not clear how publication on June 3 in the Federal Register,<br>
  that an extension for meeting requirements to July 18 had been revoked<br>
  effective July 18, is &quot;without notice&quot;. The complaint seems to be<br>
  rather that &quot;no notice of the change was given to DSHS.&quot; (Id.) The<br>
  charge is that Region X knew, or at least should have known, about the<br>
  changed regulation and should have told the State.</p>
<p> If anyone should have known about the alteration in 45 CFR 249.33(<br>
  a)(8), it would have been members of the staff of Region X, with whom<br>
  Mr. Gerth spoke. Their information was at variance with the position of<br>
  Region X, DHHS, as based upon the revocation of the above-noted federal<br>
  regulation... (Response, p.3)</p>
<p> It is not entirely clear, by any means, that Washington could have<br>
  avoided this disallowance even had it known earlier about the change in<br>
  the regulation. /7/ Nor does it appear that Region X knew about the<br>
  change and either carelessly or deliberately withheld the fact from the<br>
  State. The State refers in its response to a &quot;single act of<br>
  misinformation&quot; but there is no basis given for such a conclusion.</p>
<p><br>
  In any event, legally this would all make no difference. This is not<br>
  a situation where the Agency tried to impose the requirements of an<br>
  unpublished internal memorandum on the State. This was a change which<br>
  was duly published in the Federal Register. If the State was putting<br>
  many millions into the ICF/MR program it could reasonably be expected to<br>
  follow changes in the regulations on (14) its own initiative. It may be<br>
  unfortunate that the Region X officials, if they knew about the change,<br>
  did not specifically inform the State of it. There is no claim that the<br>
  Region deliberately withheld this information from the State. But in<br>
  any event it would not change the result of this appeal. To put it<br>
  rather tritely, &quot;Ignorance of the law /8/ is no excuse.&quot;</p>
<p><br>
  CONCLUSION</p>
<p> Based on the analysis above, and on Decision No. 176, the<br>
  disallowance is upheld in full as to Rainier School, Fircrest, and FHMC.<br>
  The disallowance is upheld as to Lakeland School except for the one day,<br>
  November 17, 1977. /1/ Decision 176 is now under review by the U.S.<br>
  District Court for the Western District of Washington, No.<br>
  C81-1197R. Although the facts in Decision No. 176 and this appeal are<br>
  identical in some instances and similar in others, neither party wished<br>
  to await the outcome of the District Court litigation before proceeding<br>
  further here. /2/ In its Order to Develop the Record the Board<br>
  asked the parties to comment on the significance, if any, of the fact<br>
  that the provider agreements for three of the four facilities were<br>
  undated. The State did not comment; the Agency said there was no<br>
  significance in this case, where the C&amp;Ts were dated. In any event, the<br>
  parties agreed that it was the date of certification that was the real<br>
  issue. (Tr. p. 18) /3/ The Agency has not specifically claimed<br>
  that the principles of either res judicata or collateral estoppel might<br>
  preclude the State from rearguing the certification dates for at least<br>
  Rainier and Lakeland, the two facilities involved in Decision No. 176,<br>
  although in closing argument at the hearing the Agency attorney did say<br>
  that Decision No. 176 is &quot;dispositive&quot; of the issues in the case. 
  (Tr.<br>
  p. 176) The claim here is for expenditures for services for the same<br>
  time period as in the prior case, but represents FFP claimed in filings<br>
  for later quarters, or &quot;increasing adjustments.&quot; In any event, no<br>
  significant new facts have been presented on the date of certification<br>
  for these two facilities and the Board makes the same determination for<br>
  them as in Decision No. 176. /4/ Unfortunately, despite the<br>
  millions of dollars involved, no one ever thought of confirming the<br>
  telephone conversations or the meeting in writing, or apparently even<br>
  making notes of them, either contemporaneously or later. /5/ The<br>
  Board has not considered the question of the authority of John McFadden<br>
  to bind the Agency to be significant, since based on its analysis it<br>
  does not matter whether he were so authorized. His authority to bind<br>
  the Agency is in fact very doubtful. The State's witnesses testified<br>
  that they considered him to be the Agency's liaison with the State on<br>
  certification requirements, but the uncontradicted Agency testimony is<br>
  that McFadden did not work for the Medicaid Bureau, and so had no<br>
  authority to interpret Medicaid policy. /6/ See, Dow Chemical<br>
  Co. v. S.S. Giovanella D'Amico, 297 F. Supp. 699, 701 (S. D.N.Y. 1969);<br>
  Playboy Enterprises, Inc. v. Chuckleberry Pub., Inc., 486 F. Supp. 414,<br>
  433 (S.D.N.Y. 1980). /7/ In its appeal the State claims that had<br>
  it been otherwise advised it could have taken steps to mitigate its loss<br>
  of FFP &quot;by expediting the compliance process of seeking a waiver from<br>
  the Secretary.&quot; There is nothing in the record to show the State ever<br>
  took any steps to seek a waiver from the Secretary during the three<br>
  years the regulation was in effect. /8/ Properly promulgated<br>
  substantive agency regulations have the force and effect of law. See,<br>
  Chrysler Corporation v. Brown, 441 U.S. 281, 295 (1979).</p>
