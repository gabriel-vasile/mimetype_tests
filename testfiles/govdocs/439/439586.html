RLEA I, 667 F.

The arbitrator<br><br>          required appellees to  honor pre-existing labor  agreements, with<br><br>          several  exceptions.  On review, the  ICC upheld the arbitrator's<br><br>          decision and held that this relief would not apply retroactively.<br><br>          It also determined that the  affected employees were entitled  to<br><br>          certain limited benefits.

This  time,<br><br>          however, they  requested  damages arising  out  of  "unauthorized<br><br>          actions," in  contrast  to the  original  action arising  out  of<br><br>          actions  authorized by the ICC.  The district court dismissed the<br><br>          claim, apparently relying on  res judicata and a lack  of subject<br>                                        ____________<br><br>          matter jurisdiction.

Res Judicata<br><br>                    It  is  unclear whether  the district  court determined<br><br>          that RLEA I precluded this  case in its entirety or if  it simply<br>               ______<br><br>          found that RLEA I barred appellants from relitigating that case's<br>                     ______<br><br>          finding  on  the  scope of  the    11341  exemption.3   Thus,  we<br><br>          address both issues.  <br><br>                    A.

Claim preclusion<br><br>                    The  res  judicata  doctrine  provides  that  "a  final<br>                         _____________<br><br>          judgment  on the merits bars a  subsequent suit on the same cause<br><br>          of action by the same parties and their privies."  Walsh v. Int'l<br>                                                             _____    _____<br><br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>          3   The court stated,  "RLEA I  dismissed the RLA  claims on  the<br>                                  ______<br>          grounds that the   11341 exemption 'relieves the participants [in<br>          the  exempted transaction]  from any  legal obstacles  that would<br>                                           ___<br>          impede the transaction. . . .'   That ruling is res  judicata and<br>                                                          _____________<br>          applies  in all respects here."  Appellants assert that the court<br>          decided that RLEA I precluded them from relitigating the scope of<br>                       ______<br>          the    11341 exemption, while appellees argue that the court held<br>          that RLEA I precludes appellants' entire claim.<br>               ______<br><br>             Technically,  res judicata represents  claim preclusion, while<br>                           ____________<br>          collateral estoppel refers to issue preclusion.   As evidenced by<br>          ___________________<br>          this  appeal, much  confusion  arises when  courts use  the terms<br>          interchangeably.  <br><br><br>                                         -4-<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          Longshoremen's Ass'n, 630 F.2d 864, 870 (1st Cir. 1980).  <br>          ____________________<br><br>                    Superficially,  the present  case seems  to fit  within<br><br>          this test.    RLEA I  involved the  same parties  as the  present<br>                        ______<br><br>          action.   In addition, as the court  in RLEA I dismissed the case<br>                                                  ______<br><br>          for  a lack of subject  matter jurisdiction, it  rendered a final<br><br>          judgment on the  merits.

However, the present case  does not<br><br>          involve the same cause of action as RLEA I.

When appellees implemented the leases, the ICC<br><br>          informed them that it would impose labor protective conditions on<br><br>          the leases in a separate decision.  ICC Finance Docket No. 30967,<br><br>          MEC-Lease, Notice  of Exemption at 5-6, served  January 23, 1987.<br><br>          The ICC specifically warned that  if appellees proceeded with the<br><br>          leases and only minimal  levels of protection,4 they would  do so<br><br>          at their own risk.   ICC Finance Docket No. 31015,  B&M-Lease and<br><br>          Trackage Rights Exemption, Notice of Exemption at  6, served June<br><br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>          4    The  protections  referred  to are  called  Mendocino  Coast<br>                                                           ________________<br>          conditions.

Appellees  continued  implementing  the  leases  and<br><br>          provided only minimal protections, allegedly violating the RLA in<br><br>          the process.   It was not until February 19,  1988, almost a year<br><br>          after  RLEA I, that the  ICC decided to  require additional labor<br>                 ______<br><br>          protections.

Co., 4 I.C.C.2d 322,<br>          ________________________________________________<br><br>          323  (1988).    As appellees  did  not  provide these  additional<br><br>          protections until the ICC explicitly required them, their initial<br><br>          actions were  unauthorized.  Essentially, appellees  gambled that<br><br>          they  would  convince  the  ICC  that  their  actions  should  be<br><br>          authorized, and they were unsuccessful.  <br><br>                    Appellants could  not have asserted  their claims based<br><br>          on the lack of  authorization of certain actions by  appellees in<br><br>          RLEA I because  they did  not know during  that litigation  which<br>          ______<br><br>          actions  the ICC authorized.   Thus, they are  not precluded from<br><br>          asserting these claims  now.   Car Carriers, Inc.  v.

As  a result, the ICC determined  that employees of rail<br><br>          carriers who were adversely affected by the transactions were not<br><br>          entitled  to retroactive  relief,  but were  entitled to  certain<br><br>          benefits.  These benefits included a maximum of seventy five days<br><br>          of make-whole benefits and  up to six years of  protective period<br><br>          benefits  beginning at  the later  of the  effective date  of the<br><br>          implementing  agreement imposing the  required conditions and the<br><br>          date when the  adverse effect  began.

Appellants were unable to persuade the  ICC that<br><br>          further labor  protection could be reconciled  with the essential<br><br>          purposes  of the  leases.   If appellants  disagree with  the ICC<br><br>          determinations, their recourse is  through appeal.  Indeed, their<br><br>          appeal  of the ruling is currently pending before another circuit<br><br><br>                                         -7-<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          court.  <br><br>                    By  asking  the  district  court  to  make  independent<br><br>          findings regarding  the extent of  labor protection which  can be<br><br>          reconciled  with  the disputed  leases,  they  are initiating  an<br><br>          impermissible  collateral attack  upon  the ICC's  decisions, see<br>                                                                        ___<br><br>          Boston   &  Maine  Corp.,  788  F.2d  at  799,  and  risking  the<br>          ________________________<br><br>          possibility of inconsistent judgments  between this court and the<br><br>          Court  of  Appeals  for the  District  of  Columbia.   We  cannot<br><br>          countenance  such a  situation.   Thus,  we  affirm the  district<br><br>          court's dismissal of the claim albeit on different grounds.5  <br><br>                    Affirmed.<br>                    ________<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>          5    The district  court apparently  based  its dismissal  on the<br>          ground  that the  ICC, not the  district court,  should determine<br>          whether  an exemption from the RLA is  necessary to carry out the<br>          lease transactions as required  by   11341.  Since we  affirm the<br>          district court's dismissal on  the ground that the claim  posed a<br>          collateral attack on an ICC determination, we need not reach this<br>          issue.  <br><br><br>                                         -8-<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></pre>
