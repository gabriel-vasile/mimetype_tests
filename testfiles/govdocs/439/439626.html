<p>Additional information is needed to more fully evaluate releases,

migration, and resulting contaminant levels at points of

potential human exposure, as well as to more fully evaluate

associated potential health concerns.  Because necessary data are

limited, ATSDR considers the Bluefield area to be an

indeterminate public health hazard.





<p>Environmental sampling shows one or more of the chemicals are

present at some of the locations.  However, for several of the

identified sites, data are too limited (or are absent) to

conclude whether improper use or disposal of the contaminants of

concern has occurred--ATSDR considers those locations to include

at least:

<p>Ongoing exposure of humans to PCBs in the Bluefield area may be

occurring for children and adults at the Sam Neal Property. 

Children and adults may have been exposed to dioxin at the Sam

Neal Property.  Worker exposure to PCBs has likely occurred in

the past at Acken Sign, APCO Service Center, Joy Manufacturing,

and Linn Electric.  There were no relevant sampling data for the

APCO Glen Lyn Plant, Blacor Steel, Bluefield Armature, the

streets of Bluefield, Bull Tail Hollow, and the Old Bluefield

Landfill in Virginia.





<p>Exposures to PCBs and dioxin at the Sam Neal property do not

appear to be great enough to result in noncarcinogenic health

effects.  Exposure to PCBs at the Sam Neal property represents a

small increase of risk for cancer for those working or living

there for many years.  However, it appears unlikely that anyone

has worked or lived there long enough to be at risk.





<p>Evaluation of age-adjusted mortality data for Tazewell and Mercer

Counties revealed no excess rates of death and total cancer.  The

age-adjusted mortality data for 1979-1988 indicate that the rate

of stomach cancer for Tazewell County, Virginia was greater than

the rate for Virginia, but less than that for the United States. 

For lung cancer, the age-adjusted mortality rate for Tazwell

County for 1979-1988 was greater than the rates for Virginia and

the United States.  However, rates for the entire county may not

reflect the occurrence of these health outcomes in the Bluefield

area.  The significance of the county-wide results needs further

evaluation.

<p align=center><strong><font size="+1"><a name="RECOMMENDATIONS">RECOMMENDATIONS</a></font></strong>



<p>ATSDR usually finds that public health issues cannot be evaluated

as thoroughly as seems appropriate because contamination and

exposure information or other data are not fully available. 

Recommendations for information that would allow ATSDR to better

evaluate those issues are provided in this section.





<p><strong>Site Characterization and Cease/Reduce Exposure Recommendations</strong>





<p><strong>General Recommendations</strong>



<ol>

<p><li>Future sampling activities should include analyses for all

contaminants of concern--PCBs, PCDDs, PCDFs, and TCE--unless

investigators are confident one or more of those compounds

will not be present.  For Bull Tail Hollow, include 2,4-D

and 2,4,5-T.





<p><li>Periodic analyses should be conducted for the contaminants

of concern for the public water supply for Bluefield, VA,

and Bluefield, WV, and for GVGPSD's system that uses Bull

Tail Hollow Reservoir to check whether any contaminants

arise at concentrations that pose a potential public health

concern.





<p><li>Analyses should be conducted of edible portions of game fish

taken from productive fishing areas in the Bluestone River

downstream of Bluefield, VA, to determine whether any of the

contaminants of concern are present at concentrations that

pose a potential public health concern.  





<p><li>Laboratory tests should be conducted using protocols that

provide detection limits that are commensurate with the low

concentrations at which some of the contaminants of concern

potentially pose adverse health effects.

</ol>



<p><strong>Site-Specific Recommendations</strong>





<p><strong>	Acken Sign Services</strong>



<ol>

<p><li>Conduct analysis of additional surficial soil samples

obtained on site and--if those results warrant--also

off-site areas to determine whether any of the contaminants

of concern are present at levels that pose a potential

public health concern.





<p><li>Conduct at least a limited survey of private wells in the

site vicinity, and conduct sampling, as appropriate, to

determine whether any of the contaminants of concern are

present in well water at concentrations that pose a

potential public health concern.

</ol>



<p><strong>	APCO Service Center</strong>



<ol>

<p><li>Conduct analyses in areas where PCB liquids are handled to

determine whether any contaminants of concern are present at

concentrations that pose a potential public health concern

to the workforce.  If excessive contaminant concentrations

are found, implement measures that reduce the contaminant

source levels or that protect workers from undue exposure.

</ol>



<p><strong>	APCO Glen Lyn Plant</strong>



<ol>

<p><li>Conduct sampling of surface soils at several residences at

varying distances in the predominant downwind direction to

determine whether contaminants have been deposited at

concentrations that could pose a public health concern.  The

sampling might be initiated in a limited area and expanded

if warranted by the initial results.





<p><li>Conduct groundwater sampling at some of the private and

public wells in the plant vicinity to determine whether any

of the contaminants of concern are present at levels that

pose a public health concern.  The sampling might be

initiated in a limited area and expanded if warranted by the

initial results.





<p><li>Assess areas where PCB liquids are handled to determine

whether any contaminants are present at levels that pose a

potential health concern to the workforce.  The sampling

might be initiated on a small scale and expanded if

warranted by the initial results.  If excessive contaminant

concentrations are found, implement measures that either

reduce the contaminant source levels or that protect workers

from exposure.

</ol>



<p><strong>	Bernard Neal Property</strong>





<ol>

<p><li>Conduct a survey of private wells in the site vicinity.  If

wells are present, conduct sampling to determine whether any

of the contaminants of concern are present in well water at

concentrations that pose a potential public health concern.





<p><li>If the site remains undeveloped, minimize the potential for

incidental human exposure to contaminants--consider fencing

the area or placing a layer of cover soil.  If the property

is developed for habitation, consider more substantial

measures for protecting public health.

</ol>



<p><strong>	Blacor Steel</strong>



<ol>

<p><li>To determine whether any of the contaminants of concern are

present at concentrations that pose a public health concern,

conduct sampling and analyses of surface soils on site in

areas where salvage operations have been done.





<p><li>If soil sampling indicates that contaminants of concern are

present, a survey should be conducted of private wells in

the site vicinity, and water sampling should be initiated at

representative wells to determine whether any of the

contaminants are present at concentrations that pose a

potential public health concern.





<p><li>If soil sampling indicates that contaminants of concern are

present at levels that pose a public health concern to 

workers, institute measures that would reduce the source

levels or protect workers.

</ol>



<p><strong>	Bluefield Armature</strong>



<ol>

<p><li>Attempt to confirm whether PCB-laden fluids or TCE have been

handled or disposed of at the facility.  If that is not

possible to confirm, conduct sampling in the building and in

surface soils behind the building to determine whether the

contaminants of concern are present at levels that pose a

potential public health concern to the workforce.  If

excessive contaminant concentrations are found, institute

measures that either reduce concentrations or that protect

workers from exposure.

</ol>



<p><strong>	Bluefield Area Streets and Alleys, City Park, Playgrounds,

and High School Track</strong>



<ol>

<p><li>Initiate sampling and analyses of surface soils at a

statistically significant number of locations selected from

the roads and other areas that were possibly sprayed to

determine whether contaminants of concern are present at

concentrations that pose a public health concern.  Evaluate

the results of that initial program to decide whether, or

where, additional sampling and analyses are needed to

complete the evaluation.  Results of soil sampling conducted

in 1993 at the high school track suggest that additional

analyses are unwarranted at that location.





<p><li>If the results of the sampling program identify locations

where exposures are a public health concern, initiate

remediation designed to reduce either the source

contamination or the exposure to levels that are acceptable

from a public health perspective.





<p><li>If concentrations at levels of concern are detected in

soils, conduct a survey of private wells near such

location(s), and sample well water to determine whether any

of the contaminants of concern are present at levels that

could adversely affect public health.

</ol>



<p><strong>	Bull Tail Hollow</strong>



<ol>

<p><li>Initiate at least a nominal soil sampling program for the

road and power distribution lines and also the private water

well to determine whether contaminants of concern are

present at concentrations that pose a public health concern. 

Evaluate the results from the initial program to decide

whether, or where, additional sampling and analyses are

needed to complete the evaluation.





<p><li>If the results of the sampling program identify locations

where exposures are a public health concern, initiate

remediation designed to reduce either the source

contamination or the exposure to levels that are acceptable

from a public health perspective.

</ol>



<p><strong>	Joy Manufacturing</strong>



<ol>

<p><li>Periodically inspect and maintain the perimeter fence system

to minimize the potential for intruder access.





<p><li>Periodically inspect and maintain the layer of fill soils

that have been placed over contaminated soils on and off

site.  Also maintain the pavements and concrete slabs that

cover contaminated soils, and maintain building components

that are necessary for structural integrity or for

preventing rain water from entering.





<p><li>If the buildings or site are used again for industry or

residences, supplemental sampling and assessment should be

made of residual contamination within the building and

perimeter to clarify whether the intended use would expose

workers or other users to contaminants in building

components or soil at concentrations that would pose a

public health concern.





<p><li>If the swale area is ever developed, conduct supplemental

sampling for contaminants of concern to determine whether

any are present at levels for which anticipated exposures

that might be associated with development would pose a

public health concern.





<p><li>EPA reports a search of well logs at county offices did not

identify any private wells in that area.  ATSDR recommends

augmenting that search by touring area streets with the

water company meter reader who could readily identify any

residences or businesses that do not have a water meter.  If

wells are present, conduct sampling to determine whether any

of the contaminants of concern are present in well water at

concentrations that pose a potential public health concern.

</ol>



<p><strong>	Lin-Electric Company</strong>



<ol>

<p><li>Clarify available clean-up documents in a manner that

clearly outlines the areas sampled, the criteria for

cleanup, the limits of areas remediated, and levels of

contaminants of concern that remain in media through which

workers might be exposed--and/or conduct additional sampling

and documentation that demonstrates that the cleanup

resulted in an environment that is compatible with worker

health.





<p><li>Conduct a survey of private wells in the site vicinity.  If

wells are present, conduct sampling to determine whether any

of the contaminants of concern are present in well water at

levels that pose a potential public health concern.

</ol>



<p><strong>	Mercer County Landfill</strong>



<ol>

<p><li>Conduct sampling of surficial soils on the landfill and on

several representative adjacent properties, including the

youth detention center, to determine whether any

contaminants of concern are present at concentrations that

pose a public health concern.





<p><li>Conduct a survey of private wells in the site vicinity.  If

wells are present, conduct sampling to determine whether any

of the contaminants of concern are present in well water at

concentrations that pose a potential public health concern.





<p><li>If the collection ponds are dredged to increase storage

capacity, take at least nominal precautions when handling

and covering dredged materials.

</ol>



<p><strong>	Old Bluefield, VA, Landfill</strong>



<ol>

<p><li>Conduct sampling of surficial soils or wastes on or

immediately around the landfill to determine whether

contaminants of concern are present at concentrations that

pose a public health concern to current trespassers or

future users of the property.





<p><li>Conduct sampling of sediments in the downgradient drainage

channel where it passes through the community of Hales

Bottom to determine whether children who might play in the

channel could be exposed to contaminants at concentrations

that pose a public health concern.





<p><li>Conduct a survey of private wells in Hales Bottom, sample

groundwater at the nearest private well downgradient and

several others to determine whether residents are being

exposed to contaminants at concentrations that pose a public

health concern.

</ol>



<p><strong>	Sam Neal Property</strong>



<ol>

<p><li>Conduct soil sampling on the immediately adjacent

residential property.





<p><li>Using the foregoing sampling data, assess public health

implications, and decide whether any remedial or other

protective measures are needed to reduce adverse exposure.





<p><li>Conduct a survey of private wells in the site vicinity.  If

wells are present, conduct sampling to determine whether any

of the contaminants of concern are present in well water at

concentrations that pose a potential public health concern.

</ol>



<p><strong>Health Activities Recommendation Panel (HARP) Recommendations</strong>





<p>The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and

Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), as amended, requires ATSDR to

perform public health actions needed at hazardous waste sites or

toxic substance releases.  To determine if public health actions

are needed, ATSDR's Health Activities Recommendation Panel (HARP)

has evaluated the data and information developed in the Bluefield

Public Health Assessment.





<p>Data are very limited. Most exposures are believed to be past and

current worker exposures, and a referral is needed to appropriate

occupational health agencies.





<p>HARP determined that residents who live on the Sam Neal property

where soil is contaminated should have their blood tested for

polychlorinated biphenyls.





<p>HARP determined that a health statistics review is needed of the

occurrence of cancer and diabetes in the Bluefield area, if

appropriate databases can be found.





<p>In addition, HARP determined that community and health

professionals education is indicated.  Community health education

should be focused at the residents of the Sam Neal Property and

should include information on how to minimize exposures via soil. 

The health professions education should focus on the effects of

PCBs, 2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, and trichloroethylene.



<br><br><br>

<p align=center><strong><font size="+1"><a name="PUBLIC">PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIONS</a></font></strong>



<p>ATSDR has asked the Virginia Department of Health to evaluate the

feasibility of a health statistics review of lung and stomach

cancer for the Bluefield, Virginia area--and, should such a study

prove feasible, to consider conducting it prior to the end of

1994.  ATSDR will conduct community health and health

professional education as resources permit.  ATSDR has determined

a biological indicator of exposure study is not needed.





<p>EPA reports they revisit former Joy Manufacturing property, the

swale, and associated areas at 6- to 9-month intervals to review

conditions and determine if any worsening conditions exist.  In

1993, in response to recommendations, EPA initiated sampling at

the swale, high school track, Sam Neal and Bernard Neal sites,

Bluefield, WV, and Bluefield, VA, water supplies, and Bull Tail

Hollow reservoir.  A sample of road/street materials also was

taken; an effort was made to duplicate a road sample taken

previously.  EPA reports they will conduct any further actions or

studies indicated by the data being developed.  The remaining

sites will be referred to the agency's Site Assessment Program

for assessment as potential Superfund sites but may be re-referred to other operating programs in EPA; timing of referral

actions is uncertain (<a href="blu_p3.html#40">40</a>).  EPA reports they anticipate a removal

action for the Sam Neal and Bernard Neal sites, with a goal of

starting the removal in April, 1994 (<a href="blu_p3.html#71">71</a>).





<p>A commenter reports that the Virginia Department of Environmental

Quality recommended three of the four sites in that state for

inclusion on CERCLIS (Comprehensive Environmental Response,

Compensation, and Liability Information System).  Two sites,

Blacor Steel and the Old Bluefield Landfill were accepted. 

Inclusion on CERCLIS indicates that a Preliminary Investigation

will be performed within a year.
