Special Conditions: Boeing Model 777 Series Airplanes; Overhead 
Crew Rest Compartment Occupiable During Taxi, Take-off, and Landing

AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.

ACTION: Final special conditions.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: These special conditions are issued for Boeing Model 777 
series airplanes. These airplanes will have novel or unusual design 
features because of the installation of an overhead crew rest 
compartment that will be occupiable during taxi, takeoff, and landing. 
The applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or 
appropriate safety standards for these design features. These special 
conditions contain the additional safety standards that the 
Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety 
equivalent to that established by the existing airworthiness standards.

DATES: Effective Date: April 14, 2004.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background

    On June 25, 2002, the Boeing Commercial Airplane Group (BCAG), P. 
O. Box 3707, Seattle, Washington, 98124, applied for a change to Type 
Certificate No. T00001SE to install an overhead crew rest (OHCR) 
compartment, in Boeing Model 777 series airplanes. The OHCR compartment 
will be occupiable during taxi, takeoff, and landing (TT&L). The Boeing 
Model 777 series airplanes are large, twin-engine airplanes with 
various passenger capacities and ranges depending upon airplane 
configuration.
    The OHCR compartment is located in the overhead space above the 
main passenger cabin immediately aft of the first pair of main deck 
emergency exits (Door 1) and includes a maximum of two private berths 
and two seats. Occupancy of the OHCR compartment will be limited to a 
maximum of four crewmembers during flight and two flight crewmembers, 
one in each seat, during TT&L.
    The OHCR compartment will be accessed from the main deck by stairs 
through a vestibule. In addition, a secondary evacuation route, which 
opens directly into the main passenger seating area, will be available 
from the OHCR compartment as an alternate route for evacuating 
occupants of the OHCR compartment. A smoke detection system and an 
oxygen system will be provided in the compartment. Other optional 
features, such as a sink with cold drink stowage or a lavatory, may be 
provided as well.
    While the installation of an OHCR compartment is not a new concept 
for large transport category airplanes, each OHCR compartment has 
unique features based on design, location, and use on the airplane. 
Previously, OHCR compartments have been installed and certified in 
Boeing Model 777 series airplanes in the main passenger seating area, 
in the overhead compartment above the main passenger seating area, and 
below the passenger seating area within the cargo compartment. On April 
9, 2003, the FAA issued Special Conditions No. 25-230-SC for an OHCR 
compartment immediately aft of the Door 1 exits, and an overhead flight 
attendant rest compartment adjacent to Door 3 in Boeing Model 777 
series airplanes. These new special conditions address an OHCR 
compartment at the same location aft of Door 1 as in the April 2003 
special conditions, except that they address occupancy by trained 
flightcrew during TT&L.

Type Certification Basis

    Under the provisions of Sec.  21.101, Amendment 21-69, effective 
September 16, 1991, Boeing Commercial Airplane Group must show that 
Model 777 series airplanes, as changed, continue to meet the applicable 
provisions of the regulations incorporated by reference in Type 
Certificate Data Sheet No. T00001SE or the applicable regulations

[[Page 22721]]

in effect on the date of application for the change. The regulations 
incorporated by reference in the type certificate are commonly referred 
to as the ``original type certification basis.'' The U.S. type 
certification basis for Boeing Model 777 series airplanes is 
established in accordance with 14 CFR 21.17 and 21.29 and the type 
certificate application date. The type certification basis is listed in 
Type Certificate Data Sheet No. T00001SE.
    If the Administrator finds that the applicable airworthiness 
regulations (i.e., 14 CFR part 25) do not contain adequate or 
appropriate safety standards for Boeing Model 777 series airplanes 
because of a novel or unusual design feature, special conditions are 
prescribed under the provisions of Sec.  21.16.
    In addition to the applicable airworthiness regulations and special 
conditions, Boeing Model 777 series airplanes must comply with the fuel 
vent and exhaust emission requirements of 14 CFR part 34 and the noise 
certification requirements of 14 CFR part 36.
    Special conditions, as defined in Sec.  11.19, are issued in 
accordance with Sec.  11.38 and become part of the type certification 
basis in accordance with Sec.  21.101.
    Special conditions are initially applicable to the model for which 
they are issued. Should the type certificate for that model be amended 
later to include any other model that incorporates the same novel or 
unusual design features, or should any other model already included on 
the same type certificate be modified to incorporate the same novel or 
unusual design features, the special conditions would also apply to the 
other model under the provisions of Sec.  21.101.
    Compliance with these special conditions does not relieve the 
applicant from the existing airplane certification basis requirements. 
One particular area of concern is that installation of the OHCR 
compartment creates a small compartment volume within the large 
overhead volume of the airplane. The applicant must comply with the 
requirements of Sec. Sec.  25.365(e), (f), and (g) (regarding the 
effects of sudden decompression) for the OHCR compartment, as well as 
any other airplane compartment whose decompression characteristics are 
affected by the installation of an OHCR compartment. Compliance with 
Sec.  25.831 (regarding ventilation) must be demonstrated for all 
phases of flight where occupants will be present.

Novel or Unusual Design Features

    This OHCR compartment is unique to part 25 due to its design, 
location, and use on the airplane. This OHCR compartment is 
particularly unique in that it is in the overhead area of the passenger 
compartment and will be occupied by trained flightcrew during TT&L.
    Due to the novel or unusual features associated with the 
installation of this OHCR compartment, special conditions are 
considered necessary to provide a level of safety equal to that 
established by the airworthiness regulations incorporated by reference 
in the type certificate. These special conditions do not negate the 
need to address other applicable part 25 regulations.

Discussion of Comments

    Notice of Proposed Special Conditions No. 25-04-01-SC for the 
Boeing Model 777 series airplanes, was published in the Federal 
Register on February 6, 2004 (69 FR 5747)). One commenter, Boeing 
Commercial Airplane Group, responded to the notice.
    Comment: Boeing states that occupancy of the OHCR compartment 
during TT&L should not be limited to flight crewmembers, but should 
also include other crewmembers, such as flight attendants.
    FAA Reply: Prior to issuance of Notice 25-04-01-SC, Boeing proposed 
to limit occupancy of the OHCR compartment during TT&L to flight 
crewmembers only. Hence, public comment was requested based on this 
limitation. Allowing other crewmembers to occupy the OHCR compartment 
during TT&L is considered beyond the scope of Notice No. 25-04-01-SC 
and should be addressed by separate notice.
    Comment: Special Condition No. 1(a)(2) restricts occupancy of the 
OHCR compartment to crewmembers the pilot in command has determined are 
trained in the ``evacuation procedures'' for the OHCR compartment. 
Boeing proposes revising ``evacuation procedures'' to ``emergency 
procedures.''
    FAA Reply: We concur with this proposal since occupants of the OHCR 
compartment must be trained in not only evacuation of the OHCR 
compartment, but also other emergency procedures (fire fighting, 
depressurization). Special Condition No. 1(a)(2) and other associated 
text in this document have been revised to address this comment.
    Comment: Special Condition 4 requires that there be at least two 
emergency evacuation routes that could be used by ``each occupant'' of 
the OHCR compartment to rapidly evacuate to the main cabin. Boeing 
proposes to change the words ``each occupant'' to ``any occupant.''
    FAA Reply: We do not agree with this change. The proposed wording 
would allow the evacuation routes to be designed to be used by any 
particular crewmember who may occupy the OHCR compartment. For example, 
compliance with the commenter's proposed wording could be found with 
two emergency evacuation routes designed for use by a 5th percentile 
female occupant only. However, the emergency evacuation routes should 
be designed to also provide rapid means of escape for persons of larger 
size. The FAA proposed wording is based on the wording of Sec.  
25.819(a) and is considered appropriate.
    Comment: Boeing proposes to refer to the emergency evacuation 
routes of Special Condition No. 4 as ``evacuation routes'' and not 
``emergency evacuation routes.''
    FAA Reply: We do not agree with this change. The term ``emergency 
evacuation route'' is based on the wording in Sec.  25.819 and is 
considered appropriate.
    Comment: Boeing proposes deleting the last sentence in Special 
Condition No. 13(b)(2) and placing a similar statement at the end of 
Special Condition No. 13. Boeing states that this would provide 
consistency with Special Conditions No. 25-230-SC and would provide 
clarity as to how the fire fighting procedures should be transmitted 
and incorporated into the operators' training and operational manuals.
    FAA Reply: Special Condition No. 13(a) is intended to address the 
requirements for a built-in extinguishing system. Paragraph (b) is 
intended to address the requirements for when manual fire fighting 
would be chosen, whether the manual system was designed as the sole 
means to fight a fire or to supplement a built-in extinguishing system 
of limited effective suppression duration, as addressed in paragraph 
(a)(2). We have therefore revised paragraph (b) to provide the needed 
clarification. Additionally, paragraph (b)(2) is made up of two 
requirements, which although complementary, could be separated without 
changing the intent. To provide the clarification suggested by Boeing, 
we have moved the last sentence of paragraph (b)(2) to a new paragraph 
(b)(4).
    Comment: Boeing proposes to add wording to the preamble discussion 
of Special Condition No. 14 which implies that smoke penetration 
requirements are

[[Page 22722]]

not applicable during TT&L for the OHCR compartment.
    FAA Reply: Smoke penetration requirements must be met during all 
phases of flight when the OHCR compartment door is closed. This door is 
required to be closed when the OHCR compartment is not occupied, even 
during TT&L. When the OHCR compartment is occupied during TT&L, the 
door must be open, and the smoke penetration requirements are not 
applicable. We consider the original preamble wording to be sufficient.
    Comment: Boeing proposes changing the word ``decompression'' to 
``depressurization'' in Special Condition No. 15.
    FAA Reply: We agree and have made this change.
    Comment: Boeing also proposes adding the following sentence to 
Special Condition No. 15: ``There must also be a limitation placed in 
the Airplane Flight Manual or other means requiring that crewmembers be 
trained in depressurization procedures.'' Boeing states that the 
addition of this sentence would ensure consistency within the special 
conditions concerning required training procedures and AFM limitations. 
Boeing further states that evacuation, fire fighting, and 
depressurization training are all required in order to occupy the OHCR 
compartment during taxi, takeoff and landing.
    FAA Reply: The last two sentences of Special Condition No. 15 state 
that decompression procedures must be established and transmitted to 
the operators for incorporation into their training programs and 
appropriate operational manuals. Thus, the existing special conditions 
imply training is required. However, to provide further clarification, 
we have added the proposed sentence to the end of Special Condition No. 
15.
    Comment: Boeing proposes to delete wording in the preamble of 
Special Condition No. 20 that explains why the requirements of Sec.  
25.787(a) should apply to the OHCR compartment.
    FAA Reply: We disagree. The current explanation provides clarity 
and should be retained in the preamble.
    The commenter proposes several other nonsubstantive revisions to 
the proposed special conditions for clarity. We have incorporated these 
revisions where appropriate.

Operational Evaluations and Approval

    These special conditions outline requirements for OHCR compartment 
design approvals (type design changes) administered by the FAA's 
Aircraft Certification Service. Prior to operational use of an OHCR 
compartment, the FAA's Flight Standards Service must evaluate and 
approve the ``basic suitability'' of the OHCR compartment for crew 
occupation. Additionally, if an operator wishes to use an OHCR 
compartment as ``sleeping quarters,'' the OHCR compartment must undergo 
an additional evaluation and approval (Reference 14 CFR 121.485(a), 
121.523(b) and 135.269(b)(5)). Compliance with these special conditions 
does not ensure that the applicant has demonstrated compliance with the 
requirements of parts 121 or 135.
    In order to obtain an operational evaluation, the type certificate 
holder must contact the appropriate aircraft evaluation group (AEG) in 
the Flight Standards Service and request a ``basic suitability'' 
evaluation or a ``sleeping quarters'' evaluation of their crew rest 
compartment. The results of these evaluations should be documented in a 
777 flight standardization board (FSB) report appendix. Individual 
operators may reference these standardized evaluations in discussions 
with their FAA principal operating inspector (POI) as the basis for an 
operational approval, in lieu of an on-site operational evaluation.
    Any changes to the approved OHCR compartment configuration that 
affect crewmember emergency egress or any other procedures affecting 
the safety of the occupying crewmembers or related emergency training 
will require re-evaluation and approval. The applicant for a crew rest 
compartment design change that affects egress, safety procedures, or 
training is responsible for notifying the FAA's AEG that a new crew 
rest compartment evaluation is required. The results of a re-evaluation 
should also be documented in a 777 FSB report appendix.
    Procedures must be developed to ensure that a crewmember entering 
the OHCR compartment through the vestibule to fight a fire will examine 
the vestibule and the lavatory areas (if installed) for the source of 
the fire prior to entering the remaining areas of the OHCR compartment. 
These procedures are intended to ensure that the source of the fire is 
not between the crewmember and the entrance to the OHCR compartment. In 
the event a fire source is not immediately evident to the firefighter, 
the firefighter should check for potential fire sources at areas 
closest to the OHCR compartment entrance first, then proceed to check 
areas in such a manner that the fire source, when found, would not be 
between the firefighter and the OHCR compartment entrance. Procedures 
describing methods to search the OHCR compartment for fire source(s) 
must be transmitted to operators for incorporation into their training 
programs and appropriate operational manuals.

Discussion of Rescue Crew Training Materials

    The installation of an OHCR compartment that can be occupied during 
TT&L by flightcrew is unique. Appropriate information must be provided 
to airport fire rescue personnel so that they understand that this 
remote compartment may be occupied during an emergency landing. The 
applicant must provide rescue crew training materials to the FAA 
Airports Division, Safety and Standards Branch (ANM-620) to address 
this issue. The FAA Airports Division, Safety and Standards Branch, 
will ensure that the materials are distributed to appropriate airports, 
domestic and foreign. A special condition is not considered appropriate 
to address this issue.

Discussion of the Special Conditions

    These special conditions establish seating, communication 
equipment, lighting, personal safety, and evacuation requirements for 
the OHCR compartment. In addition, passenger information signs and 
supplemental oxygen are required. Where applicable, the requirements 
parallel the existing requirements for a lower deck service compartment 
in Sec.  25.819 and for an OHCR compartment not occupiable during TT&L 
in Special Conditions No. 25-230-SC, issued on April 9, 2003. These 
special conditions provide a level of safety equivalent to that 
provided for main deck occupants.

Consideration of a Requirement for an External Exit

    The FAA has considered whether or not a special condition should 
require that the OHCR compartment have an external exit leading 
directly outside the airplane. In accordance with Sec.  21.16, special 
conditions must provide flight crewmembers who occupy the OHCR 
compartment during TT&L with a level of safety equivalent to that 
established by part 25 for main deck occupants. We consider that the 
following, in addition to the other special conditions, provides this 
level of safety:
    1. The distances along the evacuation routes from seats in the OHCR 
compartment to the Door 1 exits on the main deck are significantly 
shorter than the maximum distance a seated passenger on the main deck 
would need to travel to reach an exit.

[[Page 22723]]

    2. Occupancy during TT&L will be limited to two flight crewmembers 
who are trained in the evacuation, fire fighting and depressurization 
procedures of the OHCR compartment. An airplane flight manual 
limitation must be established to restrict occupancy to only persons 
the pilot in command has determined are able to use both evacuation 
routes rapidly. The ability of such persons to fit through the escape 
hatch must be considered in this determination.
    The Air Line Pilots Association, International (ALPA), and 
International Federation of Air Line Pilots (IFALPA) reviewed the 
Boeing OHCR compartment design and informed the FAA that in their 
opinion an external exit is not needed, because two independent, 
internal evacuation routes will be provided. ALPA and IFALPA provided 
this position to the FAA and Boeing in a meeting on January 7, 2003, 
and again to the FAA in letters dated February 20, 2003, and February 
21, 2003. Since flight crewmembers will be the only occupants of the 
OHCR compartment during TT&L, this input provided further support in 
determining the acceptability of these special conditions, which do not 
include a requirement for an external exit.
    As discussed in the background section, these special conditions 
address the same OHCR compartment as that addressed by Special 
Conditions No. 25-230-SC, except that these special conditions address 
occupancy of trained flightcrew during TT&L. Special Conditions No. 25-
230-SC were developed based on occupancy during flight only for 
crewmembers in general (flight crewmembers and flight attendants). 
These special conditions also allow occupancy of flight crewmembers and 
flight attendants during flight. However, the applicant has requested 
that new special conditions be developed that would allow flight 
crewmembers to occupy the OHCR compartment during TT&L. The FAA has not 
considered the acceptability of any other occupants in the OHCR 
compartment during TT&L. These special conditions limit occupancy to 
crewmembers during flight and to flight crewmembers during TT&L.

Special Condition No. 1

    Due to the location and configuration of the OHCR compartment, 
occupancy must be limited to a maximum of four crewmembers during 
flight and two flight crewmembers during TT&L. One factor which limits 
occupancy is the number of approved seats and berths provided in the 
OHCR compartment. During TT&L, occupancy must be restricted to flight 
crewmembers who the pilot in command has determined are able to use the 
evacuation routes rapidly and who are trained in the emergency 
procedures for the OHCR compartment. The FAA considers this requirement 
necessary to support a finding that the OHCR compartment will provide 
an equivalent level of safety to that provided by main deck seating. 
The special conditions also provides requirements for the installation 
of ashtrays and to prohibit smoking and the stowage of cargo or 
passenger baggage in the OHCR compartment.

Special Condition No. 2

    This special condition specifies the requirements for door access 
and locking. It provides requirements similar to those in Special 
Conditions No. 25-230-SC for the OHCR compartment that is not 
occupiable during TT&L, and also provides requirements to prevent doors 
from obstructing an evacuation after an emergency landing.

Special Condition No. 3

    Section 25.562 was established in recognition that some standard 
beyond the static conditions of Sec.  25.561 was necessary to provide 
seats which are more resistant to the dynamic nature of emergency 
landing forces. The new standard achieves this within the capability of 
traditional main deck floor-type structure. Numerous tests were 
conducted to establish this standard. The results were the 16G forward 
and 14G combined down and forward dynamic tests, as documented in Sec.  
25.562. Since Sec.  25.562 was developed based on the inherent 
capability of traditional main deck floor structure, certification 
testing of main deck floor-type structure was not required by Sec.  
25.562.
    The OHCR compartment structure bears little similarity in physical 
characteristics to main deck floor structure. In keeping with the 
intent of Sec.  25.562, this different structure must be analyzed or 
tested to demonstrate that it will function with capability similar to 
traditional main deck floor structure in an emergency landing event, 
retaining the seats and maintaining their attachments to the airplane. 
Therefore, the OHCR compartment structure must be demonstrated to be 
compatible with dynamic loads introduced by the seats, providing the 
same level of protection during an emergency landing event as that 
provided to those seated on traditional main deck floor structure. The 
applicant must propose, for FAA approval, means to analyze or test the 
OHCR compartment structure to demonstrate this capability.

Special Condition No. 4

    This special condition refers to emergency evacuation routes and 
crew rest compartment outlets. A crew rest compartment outlet is an 
opening (for example, a door or hatch) between the OHCR compartment and 
the main passenger deck. An emergency evacuation route, as used in the 
context of this special condition, is an egress path that leads OHCR 
compartment occupants to crew rest compartment outlets and out of the 
compartment.
    To preclude occupants from being trapped in the OHCR compartment in 
the event of an emergency, there must be at least two emergency 
evacuation routes that could be used by each occupant of the OHCR 
compartment to rapidly evacuate to the main cabin. These two routes 
must be sufficiently separated to minimize the possibility of an event 
rendering both routes inoperative. The main entry route meeting the 
appropriate requirements may be used as one of the emergency evacuation 
routes or, alternatively, two other emergency evacuation routes must be 
provided.
    The following clarifies the intent of Special Condition No. 4(b) 
concerning the utility of the egress routes. First, occupied passenger 
seats are not considered an impediment to the use of an egress route 
(if, for example, the egress route drops into one row of main deck 
seats by means of a hatch), provided that the seated occupants do not 
inhibit the opening of the egress route (the hatch in this example). 
Second, an egress route may use areas where normal movement or 
evacuation of passengers occurs if it is demonstrated that the 
passengers would not impede egress to the main deck. If the egress 
means opens into a main aisle, cross aisle, or galley complex, 95th 
percentile male passengers on the main deck must be considered. Third, 
the escape hatch should be provided with a means to prevent it from 
being inadvertently closed by a passenger on the main deck. This will 
ensure main deck passengers cannot prevent occupants of the OHCR 
compartment from using the escape route.
    Training requirements for the occupants of the OHCR compartment are 
included in these special conditions. Requirements to prevent 
passengers on the main deck from entering the OHCR compartment and 
requirements regarding door and hatch usability are also provided.

[[Page 22724]]

    Special Conditions No. 25-230-SC has qualitative and quantitative 
criteria for determining that the evacuation routes have sufficient 
separation within the OHCR compartment. Those criteria have been 
incorporated into these special conditions to clarify how compliance 
can be shown with Special Condition No. 4(a).

Special Condition No. 5

    This special condition requires a means for removing an 
incapacitated person from the OHCR compartment to the main deck. The 
design and procedures for such an evacuation must be demonstrated to be 
adequate for all evacuation routes. Limits would be imposed on the 
assistance that may be provided in evacuating an incapacitated person 
in these demonstrations.

Special Condition No. 6

    Exit signs, placards for evacuation routes, and illumination for 
signs, placards, and door handles are required for the OHCR 
compartment. This special condition allows for use of exit signs with a 
reduced background. If a reduced background is used, the material 
surrounding the sign must be light in color to more closely match and 
enhance the illuminated background of the sign that has been reduced in 
area (letter size stays the same). These reduced background area signs 
have been allowed under previous equivalent level of safety findings 
for small transport executive jets.

Special Condition No. 7

    An emergency lighting system is required to prevent the occupants 
from being isolated in a dark area due to loss of lighting in the OHCR 
compartment. The emergency lighting must be activated under the same 
conditions as the main deck emergency lighting system.

Special Condition No. 8

    Two-way voice communications and public address speaker(s) are 
required and provisions to prevent occupants of the OHCR compartment 
from being disturbed by normal, non-emergency announcements made to the 
passenger cabin.

Special Condition No. 9

    Means to notify occupants of the OHCR compartment of an emergency 
situation must be provided via an emergency alarm, use of the public 
address system, or a crew interphone system. Power to the emergency 
alarm system must be maintained for a specific duration after certain 
failures.

Special Condition No. 10

    There must be a means, readily detectable by seated or standing 
occupants of the OHCR compartment, of indicating when seat belts should 
be fastened. The requirement for visibility of the sign by standing 
occupants may be met by a general area sign that is visible to 
occupants standing in the main floor area or corridor of the OHCR 
compartment. It would not be essential that the sign be visible from 
every possible location in the OHCR compartment. However, the sign 
should not be remotely located or located where it may be easily 
obscured.

Special Condition No. 11

    The OHCR compartment, which is remotely located from the passenger 
cabin, must be equipped with the following:
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> A hand-held fire extinguisher.
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Protective breathing equipment (PBE).
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> A flashlight.
    The following clarifies how this special condition should be 
understood relative to the requirements of Sec.  25.1439(a). Amendment 
25-38 modified the requirements of Sec.  25.1439(a) by adding, ``In 
addition, protective breathing equipment must be installed in each 
isolated separate compartment in the airplane, including upper and 
lower lobe galleys, in which crewmember occupancy is permitted during 
flight for the maximum number of crewmembers expected to be in the area 
during any operation.'' But the PBE requirements of Sec.  25.1439(a) 
are not appropriate in this case, because the OHCR compartment is novel 
and unusual in terms of the number of occupants. In 1976, when 
Amendment 25-38 was adopted, underfloor galleys were the only isolated 
compartments that had been certificated, with a maximum of two 
crewmembers expected to occupy those galleys. This special condition 
addresses PBE requirements for OHCR compartments, which can accommodate 
up to 4 crewmembers. This number of occupants in an isolated 
compartment was not envisioned at the time Amendment 25-38 was adopted. 
In the event of a fire, an occupant's first action should be to leave 
the confined space, unless the occupant(s) is fighting the fire. It is 
not appropriate for all occupants of the OHCR compartment to don PBE. 
Taking the time to don the PBE would prolong the time for the 
occupant's emergency evacuation and possibly interfere with efforts to 
extinguish the fire. Therefore, Special Condition No. 11 requires two 
PBE units, or one PBE for each handheld fire extinguisher, whichever is 
greater, for this OHCR compartment.

Special Condition No. 12

    Because the OHCR compartment is remotely located from the main 
passenger cabin and will not always be occupied, a smoke detection 
system and appropriate warnings are required. The smoke detection 
system must be capable of detecting a fire within the OHCR compartment, 
including each area of the compartment created by the installation of a 
curtain or door.

Special Condition No. 13

    This special condition originated from a concern that a fire in an 
unoccupied OHCR compartment could spread into the passenger compartment 
or affect other vital systems before it could be extinguished. This 
special condition requires either installation of a built-in fire 
suppression system or a demonstration that the crew could 
satisfactorily perform the function of extinguishing a fire manually 
under the prescribed conditions. A built-in fire extinguishing system 
would be required only if a crewmember could not successfully locate 
and extinguish the fire during a demonstration in which the crewmember 
is responding to the alarm. (Reference Special Condition No. 13(a) in 
general.)
    This special condition also provides requirements for the use of a 
combination of the two methods of fighting a fire if the applicant so 
chooses. (Reference Special Condition No. 13(a)(2).)
    Also, the OHCR compartment must be designed so that fires within 
the compartment can be controlled without having to enter the 
compartment; or, the design of the access provisions must allow crew 
equipped for fire fighting to have unrestricted access to the 
compartment. (Reference Special Condition No. 13(b)(2).) The time for a 
crewmember on the main deck to react to the fire alarm, don 
firefighting equipment, and gain access must not exceed the time it 
would take for the OHCR compartment to become smoke filled, when it 
would be difficult to locate the fire source. (Reference Special 
Condition No. 13(b)(3).) (See additional information specified in 
Special Condition No. 14.)
    The requirements for enabling crewmember(s) to quickly enter the 
OHCR compartment, locate a fire source (Reference Special Condition No. 
13(b)), evacuate the compartment (Reference Special Condition No. 4), 
or evacuate an incapacitated person from the compartment (Reference 
Special

[[Page 22725]]

Condition No. 5), inherently places limits on the size of the OHCR 
compartment and the amount of baggage that may be stowed there. The 
OHCR compartment is limited to stowage of crew personal luggage and it 
is not intended to be used for the stowage of cargo or passenger 
baggage. The design of such a system to include cargo or passenger 
baggage would require additional requirements to ensure safe operation.
    The OHCR compartment smoke or fire detection and fire suppression 
systems (including airflow management features which prevent hazardous 
quantities of smoke or fire extinguishing agent from entering any other 
compartment occupied by crewmembers or passengers) is considered 
complex in terms of paragraph 6d of Advisory Circular (AC) 25.1309-1A, 
``System Design and Analysis.'' In addition, the FAA considers failure 
of the OHCR compartment fire protection system (i.e., smoke or fire 
detection and fire suppression systems) in conjunction with an OHCR 
compartment fire to be a catastrophic event. Based on the ``Depth of 
Analysis Flowchart'' shown in Figure 2 of AC 25.1309-1A, the depth of 
analysis should include both qualitative and quantitative assessments 
(reference paragraphs 8d, 9, and 10 of AC 25.1309-1A).

Special Condition No. 14

    Means must be provided to exclude hazardous quantities of smoke or 
extinguishing agent originating in the OHCR compartment from entering 
any other compartment. The FAA accepts the fact that during the one-
minute smoke detection time and during access to fight a fire, 
penetration of a small quantity of smoke from this OHCR compartment 
into an occupied area on this airplane configuration would be 
acceptable, based upon the limitations placed in this and other 
associated special conditions. (Reference Special Condition No.12(a), 
and Special Conditions No. 14(b), (c), (d) and (e)).

Special Condition No. 15

    The oxygen equipment and a supplemental oxygen deployment warning 
for the OHCR compartment must be equivalent to that provided for main 
deck passengers.

Special Condition No. 16

    This special condition specifies the requirements for a divided 
OHCR compartment to address supplemental oxygen equipment and 
deployment means, signs, placards, curtains, doors, emergency 
illumination, alarms, seat belt fasten signals, and evacuation routes.

Special Condition No. 17

    If a waste disposal receptacle is fitted, it must be equipped with 
an automatic fire extinguisher.

Special Condition No. 18

    Materials in the OHCR compartment must meet the flammability 
requirements of Sec.  25.853 at Amendment 25-83. Seat cushions and 
mattresses must meet the fire blocking requirements of Sec.  25.853(c).
    Section 25.853(e) indicates that crew rest compartment quarters 
need not meet the standards of Sec.  25.853(d), provided the interiors 
of these compartments are isolated from the main passenger cabin by 
doors or equivalent means that would normally be closed during an 
emergency landing. Since the OHCR compartment is occupiable during 
TT&L, the OHCR main entrance door must be latched open during TT&L, and 
hence, its interior must comply with Sec.  25.853(d) in the manner 
consistent with the main passenger cabin.

Special Condition No. 19

    This requirement is a reiteration of existing main deck lavatory 
requirements to provide clear applicability. OHCR compartment 
lavatories, if installed, must comply with the existing rules on 
lavatories in the absence of other specific requirements. In addition, 
any lavatory located in the OHCR compartment must also meet the 
requirements of Special Condition No. 12 for smoke detection due to 
placement within this remote area.

Special Condition No. 20

    This special condition requires fire protection for stowage areas 
within an OHCR compartment as a function of size (compartment interior 
volume). The fire protection requirements for stowage compartments in 
the OHCR compartment are more stringent than those for stowage in the 
main passenger cabin, because the OHCR compartment is a remote area 
that can remain unoccupied for long periods of time, in contrast to the 
main cabin that is under continuous monitoring by the cabin crew and 
passengers. For stowage compartments less than 25 ft<SUP>3</SUP>, the 
safety objective of these requirements is to contain the fire. FAA 
research indicates that properly constructed compartments meeting the 
material requirements will prevent burnthrough. For stowage 
compartments greater than 25 ft<SUP>3</SUP> but less than 200 
ft<SUP>3</SUP>, the safety objective of these requirements is to detect 
and contain the fire for sufficient time to allow it to be extinguished 
by the crew. The requirements for these sizes of compartments are 
comparable to the requirements for Class B cargo compartments. The fire 
protection requirements are intended to provide a level of safety for 
the OHCR compartment equivalent to the level of safety established by 
existing regulations for the main cabin.
    Section 25.787(a) requires each stowage compartment in the 
passenger cabin, except for underseat and overhead compartments for 
passenger convenience, to be completely enclosed. This requirement is 
not applicable to the flight deck so that flight crewmembers may 
quickly access items and better perform their duties. Occupants of the 
OHCR compartment will not be performing flight deck duties, and the FAA 
considers that stowage compartments in the OHCR compartment, except for 
under-seat compartments for occupant convenience, should be completely 
enclosed. This will provide occupants of the OHCR compartment a level 
of safety similar to that provided to main deck passengers. Note that 
typical literature pockets and magazine racks are not considered 
stowage compartments and, therefore, are not required to be completely 
enclosed by this special condition.
    The addition of galley equipment or a kitchenette incorporating a 
heat source (cook tops, microwaves, coffee pots, etc.), other than a 
conventional lavatory or kitchenette hot water heater, within the OHCR 
compartment may require further special conditions to be considered. A 
hot water heater is acceptable without further special condition 
consideration.

Applicability

    These special conditions are applicable to Boeing Model 777 series 
airplanes. Should the Boeing Commercial Airplane Group apply at a later 
date for a change to the type certificate to include another model 
incorporating the same novel or unusual design features, the special 
conditions would apply to that model as well under the provisions of 
Sec.  21.101.

Effective Date

    Under standard practice, the effective date of final special 
conditions would be 30 days after the date of publication in the 
Federal Register; however, as the certification date for a Boeing Model 
777 series airplane with an OHCR compartment that is occupiable during 
TT&L by two flight crewmembers is

[[Page 22726]]

imminent, the FAA finds that good cause exists to make these special 
conditions effective upon issuance.

Conclusion

    This action affects only certain novel or unusual design features 
on one airplane model. This is not a rule of general applicability.

The authority citation for these special conditions is as follows:

    Authority: 49 U.S.C. 106(g), 40113, 44701, 44702, 44704.

The Special Conditions

0
Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the 
Administrator, the following special conditions are issued as part of 
the type certification basis for Boeing Model 777 series airplanes with 
an overhead crew rest compartment (OHCR) installed adjacent to or 
immediately aft of the first pair of exits (Door 1).
    1. During flight, occupancy of the OHCR compartment is limited to 
the total number of bunks and seats installed in the compartment that 
are approved to the maximum flight loading conditions. During taxi, 
takeoff, and landing (TT&L), occupancy of the OHCR compartment is 
limited to the total number of installed seats approved to the flight 
and ground load conditions and emergency landing conditions. The OHCR 
compartment is limited to a maximum of four crewmembers during flight 
and two flight crewmembers during TT&L.
    (a) There must be appropriate placards, inside and outside each 
entrance to the OHCR compartment to indicate:
    (1) The maximum number of crewmembers allowed during flight and 
flight crewmembers allowed during TT&L.
    (2) That occupancy is restricted to crewmembers who the pilot in 
command has determined are trained in the emergency procedures for the 
OHCR compartment and able to rapidly use the evacuation routes.
    (3) That smoking is prohibited in the OHCR compartment.
    (4) That stowage in the crew rest compartment area is limited to 
crew personal luggage. The stowage of cargo or passenger baggage is not 
allowed.
    (b) There must be at least one ashtray on the inside and outside of 
any entrance to the OHCR compartment.
    (c) A limitation in the Airplane Flight Manual must be established 
to restrict occupancy to crewmembers who the pilot in command has 
determined are trained in the emergency procedures for the OHCR 
compartment and are able to rapidly use the evacuation routes of the 
OHCR compartment.
    2. The following requirements are applicable to crew rest 
compartment door(s):
    (a) There must be a means for any door installed between the OHCR 
compartment and passenger cabin to be quickly opened from inside the 
OHCR compartment, even when crowding from an emergency evacuation 
occurs at each side of the door.
    (b) Doors installed across emergency egress routes must have a 
means to latch them in the open position. The latching means must be 
able to withstand the loads imposed upon it when the door is subjected 
to the ultimate inertia forces, relative to the surrounding structure, 
listed in Sec.  25.561(b).
    (c) A placard must be displayed in a conspicuous place on the 
outside of the entrance door of the OHCR compartment and any other 
door(s) installed across emergency egress routes of the OHCR 
compartment, that requires these doors to be latched open during TT&L 
when the OHCR compartment is occupied. This requirement does not apply 
to emergency escape hatches installed in the floor of the OHCR 
compartment. A placard must be displayed in a conspicuous place on the 
outside of the entrance door to the OHCR compartment that requires it 
to be closed and locked when it is not occupied. Procedures for meeting 
these requirements must be transmitted to the operator for 
incorporation into their training programs and appropriate operational 
manuals.
    (d) For all doors installed in the OHCR compartment, there must be 
a means to preclude anyone from being trapped inside the OHCR 
compartment. If a locking mechanism is installed, it must be capable of 
being unlocked from the outside without the aid of a key or other 
special tools. The lock must not prevent opening from the inside of the 
OHCR compartment at any time.
    3. In addition to the requirements of Sec.  25.562 for seats, which 
are occupiable during takeoff and landing, and restraint systems, the 
OHCR compartment structure must be compatible with the loads imposed by 
the seats as a result of the conditions specified in Sec.  25.562(b).
    4. There must be at least two emergency evacuation routes that 
could be used by each occupant of the OHCR compartment to rapidly 
evacuate to the main cabin. In addition--
    (a) The routes must be located with sufficient separation within 
the OHCR compartment to minimize the possibility of an event either 
inside or outside of the crew rest compartment rendering both routes 
inoperative.
    Compliance with the requirements of Special Condition No. 4(a) may 
be shown by inspection or by analysis. Regardless of which method is 
used, the maximum acceptable distance between crew rest compartment 
outlets is 60 feet.

Compliance by Inspection

    Inspection may be used to show compliance with Special Condition 
No. 4(a). An inspection finding that an OHCR compartment has evacuation 
routes located so that each occupant of the seats and berths has an 
unobstructed route to at least one of the crew rest compartment 
outlets, regardless of the location of a fire would be reason for a 
finding of compliance. A fire within a berth that only blocks the 
occupant of that berth from exiting the berth need not be considered. 
Therefore, crew rest compartment outlets that are located at absolute 
opposite ends (i.e., adjacent to opposite end walls) of the OHCR 
compartment would require no further review or analysis with regard to 
their separation.

Compliance by Analysis

    Analysis must show that the OHCR compartment configuration and 
interior features allow all occupants of the OHCR compartment to escape 
the compartment in the event of a hazard inside or outside of the 
compartment. Elements to consider in this evaluation are as follows:
    (1) Fire inside or outside the OHCR compartment, considered 
separately, and the design elements used to reduce the available fuel 
for the fire.
    (2) Design elements to reduce the fire ignition sources in the OHCR 
compartment.
    (3) Distribution and quantity of emergency equipment within the 
OHCR compartment.
    (4) Structural failure or deformation of components that could 
block access to the available evacuation routes (for example seats, 
folding berths, contents of stowage compartments, etc.).
    (5) An incapacitated person blocking the evacuation routes.
    (6) Any other foreseeable hazard not identified above that could 
cause the evacuation routes to be compromised.
    Analysis must consider design features affecting access to the 
evacuation routes. Possibilities for design components affecting 
evacuation that should be considered include, but are not limited to, 
seat deformations in accordance with Sec. Sec.  25.561(d) and 
25.562(c)(8), seat back break-over, rigid structure that reduces access 
from one

[[Page 22727]]

part of the compartment to another, and items known to be the cause of 
potential hazards. Factors that also should be considered are 
availability of emergency equipment to address fire hazards, 
availability of communications equipment, supplemental restraint 
devices to retain items of mass that, if broken loose, could hinder 
evacuation, and load path isolation between components containing 
evacuation routes.
    Analysis of fire threats should be used in determining placement of 
required fire extinguishers and protective breathing equipment (PBE). 
This analysis should consider the possibility of fire in any location 
in the OHCR compartment. The location and quantity of PBE and fire 
extinguishers should allow occupants located in any approved seats or 
berths access to the equipment necessary to fight a fire in the OHCR 
compartment.
    The intent of this special condition is to provide sufficient 
egress route separation. Therefore the separation analysis described 
above should not be used to approve crew rest compartment outlets that 
have less physical separation (measured between the centroid of each 
outlet opening) than the minimums prescribed below, unless compensating 
features are identified and submitted to the FAA for evaluation and 
approval.
    For an OHCR compartment with one outlet located near the forward or 
aft end of the compartment (as measured by having the centroid of the 
outlet opening within 20 percent of the total length of the compartment 
from the forward or aft end of the compartment) the outlet separation 
from one outlet to the other should not be less than 50 percent of the 
total OHCR compartment length.
    For OHCR compartments with neither required crew rest compartment 
outlet located near the forward or aft end of the OHCR compartment (as 
measured by not having the centroid of either outlet opening within 20 
percent of the forward or aft end of the total OHCR compartment 
length), the outlet separation from one outlet to the other should not 
be less than 30 percent of the total OHCR compartment length.
    (b) The routes must be designed to minimize the possibility of 
blockage, which might result from fire, mechanical or structural 
failure, or persons standing below or against crew rest compartment 
outlets. One of the two crew rest compartment outlets should not be 
located where normal movement or evacuation by passengers occurs (main 
aisle, cross aisle, or galley complex, for example) that would impede 
egress from the OHCR compartment. If an evacuation route is in an area 
where normal movement or evacuation of passengers occurs, it must be 
demonstrated that passengers would not impede egress to the main deck. 
If there is low headroom at or near the evacuation route, provisions 
must be made to prevent or to protect occupants (of the OHCR 
compartment) from head injury. The use of evacuation routes must not be 
dependent on any powered device. If a crew rest compartment outlet is 
over an area where there are passenger seats, a maximum of five 
passengers may be displaced from their seats temporarily during the 
evacuation process of an incapacitated person(s). If the evacuation 
procedure involves the evacuee stepping on seats, the seats must not be 
damaged to the extent that they would not be acceptable for occupancy 
during an emergency landing.
    (c) Emergency evacuation procedures, including the emergency 
evacuation of an incapacitated occupant from the OHCR compartment, must 
be established. The applicant for a change in type design must transmit 
all of these procedures to the operator for incorporation into their 
training programs and appropriate operational manuals.
    (d) There must be a limitation in the Airplane Flight Manual or 
other suitable means requiring that crewmembers be trained in the use 
of the OHCR compartment evacuation routes. This training must instruct 
them to ensure that the OHCR compartment (including seats, doors, etc.) 
is in its proper TT&L configuration.
    (e) There must be a means to prevent passengers on the main deck 
from entering the OHCR compartment when no flight attendant is present 
or in the event of an emergency, including an emergency evacuation.
    (f) Doors or hatches that separate the OHCR compartment from the 
main deck must not adversely affect evacuation of occupants on the main 
deck (slowing evacuation by encroaching into aisles, for example) or 
cause injury to those occupants during opening or while opened.
    (g) The means of opening doors and hatches to the OHCR compartment 
must be simple and obvious. In addition, the crew rest compartment 
doors and hatches must be able to be closed from the main passenger 
cabin.
    5. There must be a means for the evacuation of an incapacitated 
person (representative of a ninety-fifth percentile male) from the OHCR 
compartment to the passenger cabin floor.
    Evacuation must be demonstrated for all evacuation routes. A 
crewmember may provide assistance in the evacuation (a total of one 
assistant within the OHCR compartment). Additional assistance may be 
provided by up to three persons in the main passenger compartment. 
These additional assistants must be standing on the floor while 
providing assistance. For evacuation routes having stairways, the 
additional assistants may ascend up to one half the elevation change 
from the main deck to the OHCR compartment, or to the first landing, 
whichever is lower.
    6. The following signs and placards must be provided in the OHCR 
compartment:
    (a) At least one exit sign, located near each crew rest compartment 
outlet, meeting the requirements of Sec.  25.812(b)(1)(i). An allowable 
exception would be a sign with reduced background area of no less than 
5.3 square inches (excluding the letters), provided that it is 
installed so that the material surrounding the exit sign is light in 
color (white, cream, light beige, for example). If the material 
surrounding the exit sign is not light in color, a sign with a minimum 
of a one-inch wide background border around the letters would be 
acceptable.
    (b) An appropriate placard must be located conspicuously on or near 
each OHCR compartment door or hatch that defines the location and the 
operating instructions for access to and operation of the outlet door 
or hatch.
    (c) Placards must be readable from a distance of 30 inches under 
emergency lighting conditions.
    (d) The door or hatch handles and operating instruction placards 
required by Special Condition No. 6(b) of these special conditions must 
be illuminated to at least 160 microlamberts under emergency lighting 
conditions.
    7. There must be a means in the event of failure of the aircraft's 
main power system, or of the normal OHCR compartment lighting system, 
for emergency illumination to be automatically provided for the OHCR 
compartment.
    (a) This emergency illumination must be independent of the main 
lighting system.
    (b) The sources of general cabin illumination may be common to both 
the emergency and the main lighting systems if the power supply to the 
emergency lighting system is independent of the power supply to the 
main lighting system.
    (c) The illumination level must be sufficient for the occupants of 
the OHCR compartment to locate and transfer to

[[Page 22728]]

the main passenger cabin floor by means of each evacuation route.
    (d) The illumination level must be sufficient, with the privacy 
curtains in the closed position, for each occupant of the crew rest 
compartment to locate a deployed oxygen mask.
    8. There must be means for two-way voice communications between 
crewmembers on the flight deck and occupants of the OHCR compartment. 
There must also be two-way communications between the occupants of the 
OHCR compartment and each flight attendant station required to have a 
public address system microphone per Sec.  25.1423(g) in the passenger 
cabin. In addition, the public address system must include provisions 
to provide only the relevant information to the crewmembers in the OHCR 
compartment (for example fire in flight, aircraft depressurization, 
preparation of the compartment for landing, etc.). That is, provisions 
must be made so that occupants of the OHCR compartment will not be 
disturbed with normal, non-emergency announcements made to the 
passenger cabin.
    9. There must be a means for manual activation of an aural 
emergency alarm system, audible during normal and emergency conditions, 
to enable crewmembers on the flight deck and at each pair of required 
floor level emergency exits to alert occupants of the OHCR compartment 
of an emergency situation. Use of a public address or crew interphone 
system will be acceptable, provided an adequate means of 
differentiating between normal and emergency communications is 
incorporated. The system must be powered in flight, after the shutdown 
or failure of all engines and auxiliary power units (APU), for a period 
of at least ten minutes.
    10. There must be a means, readily detectable by seated or standing 
occupants of the OHCR compartment, to indicate when seat belts should 
be fastened. Seat belt type restraints must be provided for berths and 
must be compatible with the sleeping position during cruise conditions. 
There must be a placard on each berth requiring that these restraints 
be fastened when occupied. If compliance with any of the other 
requirements of these special conditions is predicated on specific head 
location, there must be a placard identifying the head position.
    11. Protective breathing equipment (PBE) must be provided in 
accordance with Sec.  25.1439, except that in lieu of a device for each 
crewmember, the following must be provided: Two PBE devices approved to 
Technical Standard Order (TSO)-C116 or equivalent, suitable for 
firefighting, or one PBE for each hand-held fire extinguisher, 
whichever is greater. The following equipment must also be provided in 
the OHCR compartment:
    (a) At least one approved hand-held fire extinguisher appropriate 
for the kinds of fires likely to occur.
    (b) One flashlight.

    Note: Additional PBE and fire extinguishers in specific 
locations, beyond the minimum numbers prescribed in Special 
Condition No. 11, may be required as a result of the egress analysis 
accomplished to satisfy Special Condition No. 4(a).

    12. A smoke or fire detection system (or systems) must be provided 
that monitors each occupiable area within the OHCR compartment, 
including those areas partitioned by curtains. Flight tests must be 
conducted to show compliance with this requirement. Each system (or 
systems) must provide:
    (a) A visual indication to the flight deck within one minute after 
the start of a fire.
    (b) An aural warning in the OHCR compartment.
    (c) A warning in the main passenger cabin. This warning must be 
readily detectable by a flight attendant, taking into consideration the 
positioning of flight attendants throughout the main passenger 
compartment during various phases of flight.
    13. Means to fight a fire must be provided. The means can either be 
a built-in extinguishing system or manual hand-held bottle 
extinguishing system.
    (a) For a built-in extinguishing system:
    (1) The system must have adequate capacity to suppress a fire 
considering the fire threat, volume of the compartment, and the 
ventilation rate. The system must have sufficient extinguishing agent 
to provide an initial knockdown and suppression environment per the 
minimum performance standards (MPS) that have been established for the 
agent being used.
    (2) If the capacity of the extinguishing system does not provide 
effective fire suppression that will last for the duration of flight 
from the farthest point in route to the nearest suitable landing site 
expected in service, an additional manual firefighting procedure must 
be established. For the built-in extinguishing system, the time 
duration for effective fire suppression must be established and 
documented in the firefighting procedures in the airplane flight 
manual. If the duration of time for demonstrated effective fire 
suppression provided by the built-in extinguishing agent will be 
exceeded, the firefighting procedures must instruct the crew to:
    1. Enter the crew rest compartment at the time that demonstrated 
fire suppression effectiveness will be exceeded.
    2. Check for and extinguish any residual fire.
    3. Confirm that the fire is out.
    (b) For a manual hand-held bottle extinguishing system (designed as 
the sole means to fight a fire or to supplement a built-in 
extinguishing system of limited suppression duration) for the OHCR:
    (1) There must be a limitation in the Airplane Flight Manual or 
other suitable means requiring that crewmembers be trained in the 
firefighting procedures.
    (2) The compartment design must allow crewmembers equipped for 
firefighting to have unrestricted access to all parts of the 
compartment.
    (3) The time for a crewmember on the main deck to react to the fire 
alarm, don the firefighting equipment, and gain access to the crew rest 
compartment must not exceed the time for the compartment to become 
smoke-filled, making it difficult to locate the fire source.
    (4) Procedures describing methods to search the OHCR compartment 
for fire source(s) must be established and transmitted to the operator 
for incorporation into their training programs and appropriate 
operational manuals.
    14. There must be a means provided to exclude hazardous quantities 
of smoke or extinguishing agent originating in the OHCR compartment 
from entering any other occupiable compartment.
    (a) Small quantities of smoke may penetrate from the crew rest 
compartment into other occupied areas during the one-minute smoke 
detection time.
    (b) There must be a provision in the firefighting procedures to 
ensure that all door(s) and hatch(es) at the crew rest compartment 
outlets are closed after evacuation of the crew rest compartment and 
during firefighting to minimize smoke and extinguishing agent from 
entering other occupiable compartments.
    (c) Smoke entering any occupiable compartment when access to the 
OHCR compartment is open for evacuation of the crew rest compartment 
must dissipate within five minutes after the access to the OHCR 
compartment is closed.
    (d) Hazardous quantities of smoke may not enter any occupied 
compartment during subsequent access to manually fight a fire in the 
crew rest compartment. The amount of smoke entrained by a firefighter 
exiting the

[[Page 22729]]

crew rest compartment is not considered hazardous.
    (e) Flight tests must be conducted to show compliance with this 
requirement.
    15. There must be a supplemental oxygen system equivalent to that 
provided for main deck passengers for each seat and berth in the OHCR 
compartment. The system must provide an aural and visual warning to 
alert the occupants of the OHCR compartment to don oxygen masks in the 
event of depressurization. The warning must activate before the cabin 
pressure altitude exceeds 15,000 feet. The aural warning must sound 
continuously for a minimum of five minutes or until a reset push button 
in the OHCR compartment is depressed. Procedures for crew rest 
compartment occupants in the event of depressurization must be 
established. These procedures must be transmitted to the operators for 
incorporation into their training programs and appropriate operational 
manuals. There must also be a limitation placed in the Airplane Flight 
Manual or other suitable means requiring that crewmembers be trained in 
depressurization procedures.
    16. The following requirements apply to OHCR compartments that are 
divided into several sections by the installation of curtains or doors:
    (a) To compensate for sleeping occupants, an aural alert that can 
be heard in each section of the OHCR compartment must accompany 
automatic presentation of supplemental oxygen masks. A visual indicator 
that occupants must don an oxygen mask is required in each section 
where seats or berths are not installed. A minimum of two supplemental 
oxygen masks are required for each seat or berth. There must also be a 
means by which the oxygen masks can be manually deployed from the 
flight deck.
    (b) A placard is required adjacent to each curtain that visually 
divides or separates, for privacy purposes, the OHCR compartment into 
small sections. The placard must require that the curtain(s) remains 
open when the private section it creates is unoccupied. The vestibule 
section adjacent to the stairway is not considered a private area and, 
therefore, does not require a placard.
    (c) For each section of the OHCR compartment created by the 
installation of a curtain, requirements for the following must be met 
with the curtain open or closed:
    (1) No smoking placard (Special Condition No. 1).
    (2) Emergency illumination (Special Condition No. 7).
    (3) Emergency alarm system (Special Condition No. 9).
    (4) Seat belt fasten signal or return to seat signal as applicable 
(Special Condition No. 10).
    (5) The smoke or fire detection system (Special Condition No. 12).
    (d) OHCR compartments visually divided to the extent that 
evacuation could be affected must have exit signs that direct occupants 
to the primary stairway outlet. The exit signs must be provided in each 
separate section of the OHCR compartment, except for curtained bunks, 
and must meet the requirements of Sec.  25.812(b)(1)(i). An exit sign 
with reduced background area as described in Special Condition No. 6(a) 
may be used to meet this requirement.
    (e) For sections within an OHCR compartment that are created by the 
installation of a partition with a door separating the sections, the 
following requirements of these special conditions must be met with the 
door open or closed:
    (1) There must be a secondary evacuation route from each section to 
the main deck, or alternatively, it must be shown that any door between 
the sections has been designed to preclude anyone from being trapped 
inside a section of the compartment. Removal of an incapacitated 
occupant from within this area must be considered. A secondary 
evacuation route from a small room designed for only one occupant for 
short time duration, such as a changing area or lavatory, is not 
required. However, removal of an incapacitated occupant from within a 
small room, such as a changing area or lavatory, must be considered.
    (2) Any door between the sections must be shown to be openable when 
crowded against, even when crowding occurs at each side of the door.
    (3) There may be no more than one door between any seat or berth 
and the primary stairway door.
    (4) There must be exit signs in each section meeting the 
requirements of Sec.  25.812(b)(1)(i) that direct occupants to the 
primary stairway outlet. An exit sign with reduced background area as 
described in Special Condition No. 6(a) may be used to meet this 
requirement.
    (5) Special Conditions No. 1 (no smoking placards), No. 7 
(emergency illumination), No. 9 (emergency alarm system), No. 10 
(fasten seat belt signal or return to seat signal as applicable) and 
No. 12 (smoke or fire detection system) must be met with the door open 
or closed.
    (6) Special Conditions No. 8 (two-way voice communication) and No. 
11 (emergency firefighting and protective equipment) must be met 
independently for each separate section except for lavatories or other 
small areas that are not intended to be occupied for extended periods 
of time.
    17. Where a waste disposal receptacle is fitted, it must be 
equipped with an automatic fire extinguisher that meets the performance 
requirements of Sec.  25.854(b).
    18. Materials (including finishes or decorative surfaces applied to 
the materials) must comply with the requirements of Sec.  25.853 as 
amended by Amendment 25-83. Seat cushions and mattresses must comply 
with the flammability requirements of Sec.  25.853(c), as amended by 
Amendment 25-83, and the test requirements of part 25, appendix F, part 
II, or other equivalent methods.
    19. The addition of a lavatory within the OHCR compartment would 
require the lavatory to meet the same requirements as those for a 
lavatory installed on the main deck except with regard to Special 
Condition No. 12 for smoke detection.
    20. Each stowage compartment in the crew rest compartment, except 
for underseat compartments for occupant convenience, must be completely 
enclosed. All enclosed stowage compartments within the OHCR compartment 
that are not limited to stowage of emergency equipment or airplane 
supplied equipment must meet the design criteria given in the table 
below. Enclosed stowage compartments greater than 200 ft <SUP>3</SUP> 
in interior volume are not addressed by this special condition. The in-
flight accessibility of very large enclosed stowage compartments and 
the subsequent impact on the crewmembers' ability to effectively reach 
any part of the compartment with the contents of a hand fire 
extinguisher will require additional fire protection considerations 
similar to those required for inaccessible compartments such as Class C 
cargo compartments.

      Requirements for Fire Protection Features for Stowage Compartments Depending on Interior Volume Size
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                            Applicability of fire protection requirements by interior volume
                                      --------------------------------------------------------------------------
       Fire protection features                                  25 Cubic feet to less     57 Cubic feet to 200
                                       Less than 25 cubic feet     than 57 cubic feet           cubic feet
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Materials of Construction \1\........  Yes....................  Yes....................  Yes.
Smoke or Fire Detectors \2\..........  No.....................  Yes....................  Yes.
Liner \3\............................  No.....................  Conditional............  Yes.
Location Detector \4\................  No.....................  Yes....................  Yes.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ Material: The material used to construct each enclosed stowage compartment must at least be fire resistant
  and must meet the flammability standards established for interior components (i.e., 14 CFR Part 25 Appendix F,
  Parts I, IV, and V) per the requirements of Sec.   25.853. For compartments less than 25 ft3 in interior
  volume, the design must ensure the ability to contain a fire likely to occur within the compartment under
  normal use.
\2\ Smoke or Fire Detectors: Enclosed stowage compartments equal to or exceeding 25 ft 3 in interior volume must
  be provided with a smoke or fire detection system to ensure that a fire can be detected within a one-minute
  detection time. Flight tests must be conducted to show compliance with this requirement. Each system (or
  systems) must provide: (a) A visual indication in the flight deck within one minute after the start of a fire.
  (b) An aural warning in the OHCR compartment. (c) A warning in the main passenger cabin. This warning must be
  readily detectable by a flight attendant, taking into consideration the positioning of flight attendants
  throughout the main passenger compartment during various phases of flight.
\3\ Liner: If it can be shown that the material used to construct the stowage compartment meets the flammability
  requirements of a liner for a Class B cargo compartment (i.e., Sec.   25.855 at Amendment 25-93, and Appendix
  F, part I, paragraph (a)(2)(ii)), then no liner would be required for enclosed stowage compartments equal to
  or greater than 25 ft 3 in interior volume but less than 57 ft 3 in interior volume. For all enclosed stowage
  compartments equal to or greater than 57 ft 3 in interior volume but less than or equal to 200 ft 3, a liner
  must be provided that meets the requirements of Sec.   25.855 for a Class B cargo compartment.
\4\ Location Detector: OHCR compartments that contain enclosed stowage compartments exceeding 25 ft 3 in
  interior volume and are located away from one central location such as the entry to the OHCR compartment or a
  common area within the OHCR compartment would require additional fire protection features and/or devices to
  assist the firefighter in determining the location of a fire.
