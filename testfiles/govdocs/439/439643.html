ACTION: Notice of proposed special conditions.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: This action proposes special conditions for Boeing Model 777 
series airplanes. These airplanes will have novel or unusual design 
features because of the installation of an overhead crew rest (OHCR) 
compartment which is proposed to be occupiable during taxi, take-off, 
and landing (TT&L). The applicable airworthiness regulations do not 
contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for these design 
features. These proposed special conditions contain the additional 
safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to 
establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the 
existing airworthiness standards.

DATES: Comments must be received on or before March 8, 2004.

Background

    On June 25, 2002, the Boeing Commercial Airplane Group (BCAG), P.O. 
Box 3707, Seattle, Washington, 98124, applied for a change to Type 
Certificate No. T00001SE for a design change to install an OHCR, which 
is proposed to be occupiable during TT&L, in Boeing Model 777 series 
airplanes. The Boeing Model 777 series airplanes are large twin-engine 
airplanes with various passenger capacities and ranges depending upon 
airplane configuration.
    The OHCR compartment is located in the overhead space above the 
main passenger cabin immediately aft of the first pair of main deck 
emergency exits (Door 1) and will include a maximum of two private 
berths and two seats. Occupancy of the OHCR compartment will be limited 
to a maximum of four crewmembers during flight and two flightcrew 
members, one in each seat, during TT&L.
    The OHCR compartment will be accessed from the main deck by stairs 
through a vestibule. In addition, an emergency hatch, which opens 
directly into the main passenger seating area, will be provided for the 
OHCR compartment as an alternate route for evacuating occupants of the 
OHCR compartment in an emergency. A smoke detection system and an 
oxygen system will be provided in the compartment. Other optional 
features, such as a kitchenette and lavatory, may be provided as well.
    While the installation of an OHCR compartment is not a new concept 
for large transport category airplanes, each OHCR compartment has 
unique features based on design, location, and use on the airplane. 
Previously, OHCR compartments have been installed and certified in 
Boeing 777 series airplanes in the main passenger seating area, in the 
overhead compartment above the main passenger seating area, and below 
the passenger seating area within the cargo compartment. On April 9, 
2003, the FAA issued Special Conditions No. 25-230-SC for an OHCR 
compartment immediately aft of the Door 1 exits and an overhead flight 
attendant rest compartment adjacent to Door 3 in Boeing 777 series 
airplanes. These new special conditions address an OHCR compartment at 
the same location aft of Door 1 as in the April 2003 special 
conditions, except that they address occupancy of trained flightcrew 
during TT&L.

Type Certification Basis

    Under the provisions of Sec. 21.101, Amendment 21-69, effective 
September 16, 1991, Boeing Commercial Airplane Group must show that 
Model 777 series airplanes, as changed, continue to meet the applicable 
provisions of the regulations incorporated by reference in Type 
Certificate Data Sheet No. T00001SE or the applicable regulations in 
effect on the date of application for the change. Subsequent changes 
have been made to Sec. 21.101 as part of Amendment 21-77, but those 
changes did not become effective until June 10, 2003, which is after 
the application date for this type design change. The regulations 
incorporated by reference in the type certificate are commonly referred 
to as the ``original type certification basis.'' The U.S. type 
certification basis for Boeing Model 777 series airplanes is 
established in accordance with 14 CFR 21.17 and 21.29 and the type 
certificate application date. The type certification basis is listed in 
Type Certificate Data Sheet No. T00001SE.
    If the Administrator finds that the applicable airworthiness 
regulations (i.e., 14 CFR part 25) do not contain adequate or 
appropriate safety standards for Boeing Model 777 series airplanes 
because of a novel or unusual design feature, special conditions are

[[Page 5748]]

prescribed under the provisions of Sec. 21.16.
    In addition to the applicable airworthiness regulations and special 
conditions, Boeing Model 777 series airplanes must comply with the fuel 
vent and exhaust emission requirements of 14 CFR part 34 and the noise 
certification requirements of 14 CFR part 36.
    Special conditions, as defined in Sec. 11.19, are issued in 
accordance with Sec. 11.38 and become part of the type certification 
basis in accordance with Sec. 21.101(b)(2) Amendment 21-69, effective 
September 16, 1991.
    Special conditions are initially applicable to the model for which 
they are issued. Should the type certificate for that model be amended 
later to include any other model that incorporates the same novel or 
unusual design features, or should any other model already included on 
the same type certificate be modified to incorporate the same novel or 
unusual design features, the special conditions would also apply to the 
other model under the provisions of Sec. 21.101(a)(1) Amendment 21-69, 
effective September 16, 1991.
    Compliance with these proposed special conditions does not relieve 
the applicant from the existing airplane certification basis 
requirements. One particular area of concern is that installation of 
the OHCR compartment creates a small compartment volume within the 
large overhead volume of the airplane. The applicant must comply with 
the requirements of Sec.Sec. 25.365(e), (f), and (g) (regarding the 
effects of sudden decompression) for the OHCR compartment, as well as 
any other airplane compartment whose decompression characteristics are 
affected by the installation of an OHCR compartment. Compliance with 
Sec. 25.831 (regarding ventilation) must be demonstrated for all phases 
of flight where occupants will be present.

Novel or Unusual Design Features

    This OHCR compartment is unique to part 25 due to its design, 
location and use on the airplane. This OHCR compartment is particularly 
unique in that it is in the overhead area of the passenger compartment 
and is proposed to be occupied by trained flight crew during TT&L.
    Due to the novel or unusual features associated with the 
installation of this OHCR compartment, special conditions are 
considered necessary to provide a level of safety equal to that 
established by the airworthiness regulations incorporated by reference 
in the type certificate. These special conditions do not negate the 
need to address other applicable part 25 regulations.

Operational Evaluations and Approval

    These special conditions outline requirements for OHCR compartment 
design approvals (type design changes) administered by the FAA's 
Aircraft Certification Service. Prior to operational use of an OHCR 
compartment, the FAA's Flight Standards Service must evaluate and 
approve the ``basic suitability'' of the OHCR compartment for crew 
occupation. Additionally, if an operator wishes to utilize an OHCR 
compartment as ``sleeping quarters,'' the OHCR compartment must undergo 
an additional evaluation and approval (Reference Sec.Sec. 121.485(a), 
121.523(b) and 135.269(b)(5)). Compliance with these special conditions 
does not ensure that the applicant has demonstrated compliance with the 
requirements of parts 121 or 135.
    In order to obtain an operational evaluation, the type certificate 
holder must contact the appropriate aircraft evaluation group (AEG) in 
the Flight Standards Service and request a ``basic suitability'' 
evaluation or a ``sleeping quarters'' evaluation of their crew rest. 
The results of these evaluations should be documented in a 777 flight 
standardization board (FSB) report appendix. Individual operators may 
reference these standardized evaluations in discussions with their FAA 
principal operating inspector (POI) as the basis for an operational 
approval, in lieu of an on-site operational evaluation.
    Any changes to the approved OHCR compartment configuration that 
affect crewmember emergency egress or any other procedures affecting 
the safety of the occupying crewmembers and/or related emergency 
evacuation training will require a re-evaluation and approval. The 
applicant for a crew rest design change that affects egress, safety 
procedures, or training is responsible for notifying the FAA's AEG that 
a new crew rest evaluation is required. The results of a re-evaluation 
should also be documented in a 777 FSB report appendix.
    Procedures must be developed to ensure that a crewmember entering 
the OHCR compartment through the vestibule to fight a fire will examine 
the vestibule and the lavatory areas (if installed) for the source of 
the fire prior to entering the remaining areas of the OHCR compartment. 
These procedures are intended to ensure that the source of the fire is 
not between the crewmember and the entrance to the OHCR compartment. In 
the event a fire source is not immediately evident to the firefighter, 
the firefighter should check for potential fire sources at areas 
closest to the OHCR compartment entrance first, then proceed to check 
areas in such a manner that the fire source, when found, would not be 
between the firefighter and the OHCR compartment entrance. Procedures 
describing methods to search the OHCR compartment for fire source(s) 
must be transmitted to operators for incorporation into their training 
programs and appropriate operational manuals.

Discussion of the Proposed Special Conditions

    These proposed special conditions establish seating, communication 
equipment, lighting, personal safety, and evacuation requirements for 
the OHCR compartment. In addition, passenger information signs and 
supplemental oxygen would be required. Where applicable, the proposed 
requirements parallel the existing requirements for a lower deck 
service compartment in Sec. 25.819 and for an OHCR compartment not 
occupiable during TT&L in Special Conditions No. 25-230-SC, issued on 
April 9, 2003. These proposed special conditions provide a level of 
safety equivalent to that provided for main deck occupants.

Consideration of a Requirement for an External Exit

    The FAA has considered whether or not a special condition should 
require that the OHCR compartment have an external exit leading 
directly outside the airplane. In accordance with Sec. 21.16, special 
conditions must provide flightcrew members who occupy the OHCR 
compartment during TT&L with a level of safety equivalent to that 
established by part 25 for main deck occupants. The FAA considers that 
the following, in addition to the other proposed special conditions, 
provides this level of safety:
    1. The distances along the evacuation routes from seats in the OHCR 
compartment to the Door 1 exits on the main deck are significantly 
shorter than the maximum distance a seated passenger on the main deck 
would need to travel to reach an exit.
    2. Occupancy during TT&L would be limited to two flightcrew members 
who are trained in the evacuation procedures of the OHCR compartment. 
An airplane flight manual limitation would be established to restrict 
occupancy to only persons the pilot in command has determined are able 
to use both evacuation routes rapidly. The ability of such persons to 
fit through the escape

[[Page 5749]]

hatch must be considered in this determination.
    The Air Line Pilots Association, International (ALPA), and 
International Federation of Air Line Pilots (IFALPA) reviewed the 
Boeing OHCR compartment design and informed the FAA that in their 
opinion an external exit is not needed, because two independent, 
internal evacuation routes will be provided. ALPA and IFALPA provided 
this position to the FAA and Boeing in a meeting on January 7, 2003, 
and again to the FAA in letters dated February 20, 2003, and February 
21, 2003. Since flightcrew members will be the only occupants of the 
OHCR compartment during TT&L, this input provided further support in 
determining the acceptability of these proposed special conditions, 
which do not include a requirement for an external exit.
    As discussed in the background section, these proposed special 
conditions address the same OHCR compartment as that addressed by 
Special Conditions No. 25-230-SC, except that these proposed special 
conditions address occupancy of trained flightcrew during TT&L. Special 
Conditions No. 25-230-SC were developed based on occupancy during 
flight only for crewmembers in general (flightcrew members and flight 
attendants). The proposed special conditions also allow occupancy of 
flightcrew members and flight attendants during flight. However, the 
applicant has requested that new special conditions be developed that 
would allow flightcrew members to occupy the OHCR compartment during 
TT&L. The FAA has not considered the acceptability of any other 
occupants in the OHCR compartment during TT&L. The proposed special 
conditions limit occupancy to crewmembers during flight and to 
flightcrew members during TT&L.

Proposed Special Condition No. 1

    Due to the location and configuration of the OHCR compartment, it 
is proposed that occupancy be limited to a maximum of four crewmembers 
during flight and two flightcrew members during TT&L. One factor which 
limits occupancy is the number of approved seats and berths provided in 
the OHCR compartment. During TT&L, occupancy would be restricted to 
flightcrew members who the pilot in command has determined are able to 
use the evacuation routes rapidly and who are trained in the evacuation 
procedures for the OHCR compartment. The FAA considers this requirement 
necessary to support a finding that the OHCR compartment will provide 
an equivalent level of safety to that provided by main deck seating. 
Requirements are also proposed for the installation of ashtrays and to 
prohibit smoking and the stowage of cargo or passenger baggage in the 
OHCR compartment.

Proposed Special Condition No. 2

    This special condition has the requirements for door access and 
locking. It provides requirements similar to those in Special 
Conditions No. 25-230-SC for the OHCR compartment that is not 
occupiable during TT&L, but also provides requirements to prevent doors 
from obstructing an evacuation after an emergency landing.

Proposed Special Condition No. 3

    Section 25.562 was established in recognition that some standard 
beyond the static conditions of Sec. 25.561 was necessary to provide 
more crash-resistant seats, with the new standard being one that 
traditional main deck floor-type structure could withstand. Numerous 
tests were conducted to establish this standard. The results were the 
16G forward and 14G combined down and forward dynamic tests, as 
documented in Sec. 25.562. Since Sec. 25.562 was developed based on the 
inherent capability of traditional main deck floor structure, 
certification testing of main deck floor-type structure was not 
required by Sec. 25.562.
    The OHCR compartment structure bears little similarity in physical 
characteristics to main deck floor structure. In keeping with the 
intent of Sec. 25.562, this different structure must be analyzed or 
tested to demonstrate that it will function with capability similar to 
traditional main deck floor structure in a crash event, retaining the 
seats and maintaining their attachments to the airplane. Therefore, it 
is proposed that the OHCR compartment structure must be demonstrated to 
be compatible with dynamic loads introduced by the seats, providing the 
same level of protection during a crash event as that provided to those 
seated on traditional main deck floor structure. The applicant must 
propose, for FAA approval, means to analyze or test the OHCR 
compartment structure to demonstrate this capability.

Proposed Special Condition No. 4

    This special condition refers to emergency evacuation routes and 
crew rest outlets. A crew rest outlet is an opening (for example, a 
door or hatch) between the OHCR compartment and the main passenger 
deck. An emergency evacuation route, as used in the context of this 
special condition, is an egress path which leads OHCR compartment 
occupants to crew rest outlets and out of the compartment.
    It is proposed that, to preclude occupants from being trapped in 
the OHCR compartment in the event of an emergency, there must be at 
least two emergency evacuation routes that could be used by each 
occupant of the OHCR compartment to rapidly evacuate to the main cabin. 
These two routes must be sufficiently separated to minimize the 
possibility of an event rendering both routes inoperative. The main 
entry route meeting the appropriate requirements may be utilized as one 
of the emergency evacuation routes or, alternatively, two other 
emergency routes must be provided.
    The following clarifies the intent of Special Condition No. 4(b) 
concerning the utility of the egress routes. First, occupied passenger 
seats are not considered an impediment to the use of an egress route 
(if, for example, the egress route drops into one row of main deck 
seats by means of a hatch), provided that the seated occupants do not 
inhibit the opening of the egress route (the hatch in this example). 
Second, an egress route may utilize areas where normal movement or 
evacuation of passengers occurs if it is demonstrated that the 
passengers would not impede egress to the main deck. If the egress 
means opens into a main aisle, cross aisle, or galley complex, ninety-
fifth percentile male passengers on the main deck must be considered. 
Third, the escape hatch should be provided with a means to prevent it 
from being inadvertently closed by a passenger on the main deck. This 
will ensure main deck passengers cannot prevent occupants of the OHCR 
compartment from using the escape route.
    Training requirements for the occupants of the OHCR compartment are 
included in this proposal. Requirements to prevent passengers on the 
main deck from entering the OHCR compartment and requirements regarding 
door and hatch usability are also provided.
    Special Conditions No. 25-230-SC has qualitative and quantitative 
criteria for determining that the evacuation routes have sufficient 
separation within the OHCR compartment. Those criteria have been 
incorporated into these special conditions to clarify how compliance 
can be shown to Special Condition No. 4(a).

Proposed Special Condition No. 5

    This proposal would require a means of removing an incapacitated 
person

[[Page 5750]]

from the OHCR compartment to the main deck. The design and procedures 
for such an evacuation must be demonstrated to be adequate for all 
evacuation routes. Limits would be imposed on the assistance that may 
be provided in evacuating an incapacitated person in these 
demonstrations.

Proposed Special Condition No. 6

    It is proposed that exit signs, placards for evacuation routes, and 
illumination for signs, placards, and door handles be required for the 
OHCR compartment. This proposed special condition allows for exit signs 
with a reduced background area to be used. If a reduced background is 
used, the material surrounding the sign must be light in color to more 
closely match and enhance the illuminated background of the sign that 
has been reduced in area (letter size stays the same). These reduced 
background area signs have been allowed under previous equivalent level 
of safety findings for small transport executive jets.

Proposed Special Condition No. 7

    An emergency lighting system is proposed to prevent the occupants 
from being isolated in a dark area due to loss of lighting in the OHCR 
compartment. The emergency lighting must be activated under the same 
conditions as is the main deck emergency lighting system.

Proposed Special Condition No. 8

    It is proposed that two-way voice communications and public address 
speaker(s) be required, and that provisions be made to prevent 
occupants of the OHCR compartment from being disturbed with normal, 
non-emergency announcements made to the passenger cabin.

Proposed Special Condition No. 9

    It is proposed that occupants of the OHCR compartment be advised of 
an emergency situation via emergency alarm means, use of the public 
address system, or crew interphone system. A requirement for 
maintaining power to the emergency alarm system for a specific duration 
after certain failures is also proposed.

Proposed Special Condition No. 10

    This proposal requires a means of indicating when seat belts should 
be fastened that is readily detectable by occupants of the OHCR 
compartment whether they are seated or standing. The requirement for 
visibility of the sign by standing occupants may be met by a general 
area sign that is visible to occupants standing in the main floor area 
or corridor of the OHCR compartment. It would not be essential that the 
sign be visible from every possible location in the OHCR compartment. 
However, the sign should not be remotely located or located where it 
may be easily obscured.

Proposed Special Condition No. 11

    This proposal requires that the OHCR compartment, which is remotely 
located from the passenger cabin, be equipped with the following:
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> A hand-held fire extinguisher.
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Protective breathing equipment (PBE).
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> A flashlight.
    The following clarifies how this proposed special condition should 
be understood relative to the requirements of Sec. 25.1439(a). 
Amendment 25-38 modified the requirements of Sec. 25.1439(a) by adding, 
``In addition, protective breathing equipment must be installed in each 
isolated separate compartment in the airplane, including upper and 
lower lobe galleys, in which crewmember occupancy is permitted during 
flight for the maximum number of crewmembers expected to be in the area 
during any operation.'' But the PBE requirements of Sec. 25.1439(a) are 
not appropriate in this case, because the OHCR compartment is novel and 
unusual in terms of the number of occupants. In 1976, when Amendment 
25-38 was adopted, underfloor galleys were the only isolated 
compartments that had been certificated, with a maximum of two 
crewmembers expected to occupy those galleys. No. 11 of these special 
conditions addresses PBE requirements for OHCR compartments, which can 
accommodate up to 4 crewmembers. This number of occupants in an 
isolated compartment was not envisioned at the time Amendment 25-38 was 
adopted. In the event of a fire, the occupant's first action should be 
to leave the confined space, unless the occupant(s) is fighting the 
fire. It is not appropriate for all occupants of the OHCR compartment 
to don PBE. Taking the time to don the PBE would prolong the time for 
the occupant's emergency evacuation and possibly interfere with efforts 
to extinguish the fire. Therefore, No. 11 proposes to require two PBE 
units, or one PBE for each handheld fire extinguisher, whichever is 
greater, for this OHCR compartment.

Proposed Special Condition No. 12

    Because the OHCR compartment is remotely located from the main 
passenger cabin and will not always be occupied, a requirement for a 
smoke detection system and appropriate warnings is proposed. The smoke 
detection system must be capable of detecting a fire within the OHCR 
compartment, including each area of the compartment created by the 
installation of a curtain or door.

Proposed Special Condition No. 13

    This proposed special condition originated from a concern that a 
fire in an unoccupied OHCR compartment could spread into the passenger 
compartment or affect other vital systems before it could be 
extinguished. This proposal would require either installation of a 
manually activated fire suppression system accessible from outside the 
OHCR compartment or a demonstration that the crew could satisfactorily 
perform the function of extinguishing a fire under the prescribed 
conditions. A manually activated built-in fire extinguishing system 
would be required only if a crewmember could not successfully locate 
and extinguish the fire during a demonstration in which the crewmember 
is responding to the alarm. (Ref. S.C. 13 and 13(a) in general)
    This proposal also provides requirements for the use of a 
combination of the two methods of fighting a fire if the applicant so 
chose. (Ref. S.C. 13(a)(2))
    It is proposed that the OHCR compartment be designed so that fires 
within the compartment can be controlled without having to enter the 
compartment; or, the design of the access provisions must allow crew 
equipped for firefighting to have unrestricted access to the 
compartment. (Ref. S.C. 13(b)(2)) It is also proposed that the time for 
a crewmember on the main deck to react to the fire alarm, don 
firefighting equipment, and gain access must not exceed the time it 
would take for the OHCR compartment to become smoke filled, when it 
would be difficult to locate the fire source. (Ref. S.C. 13(b)(3)) (See 
additional information continued in the proposed Special Condition No. 
14.)
    The requirements for enabling crewmember(s) to quickly enter the 
OHCR compartment, locate a fire source (Ref. S.C. (13(b)), evacuate the 
compartment (Ref. S.C. (4)), or evacuate an incapacitated person from 
the compartment (Ref. S.C. (5)), inherently places limits on the size 
of the OHCR compartment and the amount of baggage that may be stowed 
there. The OHCR compartment is limited to stowage of crew personal 
luggage and it is not intended to be used for the stowage of cargo or 
passenger baggage. The design of such a system to include cargo or 
passenger baggage would require

[[Page 5751]]

additional requirements to ensure safe operation.
    The OHCR compartment smoke or fire detection and fire suppression 
systems (including airflow management features which prevent hazardous 
quantities of smoke or fire extinguishing agent from entering any other 
compartment occupied by crewmembers or passengers) is considered 
complex in terms of paragraph 6d of Advisory Circular (AC) 25.1309-1A, 
``System Design and Analysis.'' In addition, the FAA considers failure 
of the OHCR compartment fire protection system (i.e., smoke or fire 
detection and fire suppression systems) in conjunction with an OHCR 
compartment fire to be a catastrophic event. Based on the ``Depth of 
Analysis Flowchart'' shown in Figure 2 of AC 25.1309-1A, the depth of 
analysis should include both qualitative and quantitative assessments 
(reference paragraphs 8d, 9, and 10 of AC 25.1309-1A).

Proposed Special Condition No. 14

    This proposal would require that means be provided to exclude 
hazardous quantities of smoke or extinguishing agent originating in the 
OHCR compartment from entering any other compartment. The FAA accepts 
the fact that during the one-minute smoke detection time and during 
access to fight a fire, penetration of a small quantity of smoke from 
this OHCR compartment into an occupied area on this airplane 
configuration would be acceptable, based upon the limitations placed in 
this and other associated special conditions. (Ref. S.C. 12(a) and 
14(b), (c), (d) and (e)).

Proposed Special Condition No. 15

    It is proposed that the oxygen equipment and a supplemental oxygen 
deployment warning for the OHCR compartment must be equivalent to that 
provided for main deck passengers.

Proposed Special Condition No. 16

    Requirements are proposed for a divided OHCR compartment to address 
supplemental oxygen equipment and deployment means, signs, placards, 
curtains, doors, emergency illumination, alarms, seat belt fasten 
signals, and evacuation routes.

Proposed Special Condition No. 17

    It is proposed that if a waste disposal receptacle is fitted, it 
must be equipped with an automatic fire extinguisher.

Proposed Special Condition No. 18

    This proposal requires that materials in the OHCR compartment meet 
the flammability requirements of Sec. 25.853 at Amendment 25-83. It is 
also proposed that seat cushions and mattresses must meet the fire 
blocking requirements of Sec. 25.853(c).
    Section 25.853(e) indicates that crew rest quarters need not meet 
the standards of Sec. 25.853(d) provided the interiors of these 
compartments are isolated from the main passenger cabin by doors or 
equivalent means that would normally be closed during an emergency 
landing. Since the OHCR compartment is occupiable during TT&L, the OHCR 
main entrance door must be latched open during TT&L, and hence, its 
interior must comply with Sec. 25.853(d) in the manner consistent with 
the main passenger cabin.

Proposed Special Condition No. 19

    This proposed requirement is a reiteration of existing main deck 
lavatory requirements to provide clear applicability. OHCR compartment 
lavatories, if installed, would be required to comply with the existing 
rules on lavatories in the absence of other specific requirements. In 
addition, any lavatory located in the OHCR compartment must also meet 
the requirements of Special Condition No. 12 for smoke detection due to 
placement within this remote area.

Proposed Special Condition No. 20

    This proposal requires fire protection for stowage areas within an 
OHCR compartment as a function of size (compartment interior volume). 
The proposed fire protection requirements for stowage compartments in 
the OHCR compartment are more stringent than those for stowage in the 
main passenger cabin, because the OHCR compartment is a remote area 
that can remain unoccupied for long periods of time, in contrast to the 
main cabin that is under continuous monitoring by the cabin crew and 
passengers. For stowage compartments less than 25 ft<SUP>3</SUP>, the 
safety objective of these proposed requirements is to contain the fire. 
FAA research indicates that properly constructed compartments meeting 
the proposed material requirements will prevent burn-through. For 
stowage compartments greater than 25 ft<SUP>3</SUP> but less than 200 
ft<SUP>3</SUP>, the safety objective of these proposed requirements is 
to detect and contain the fire for sufficient time to allow it to be 
extinguished by the crew. The requirements for these sizes of 
compartments are comparable to the requirements for Class B cargo 
compartments. The fire protection requirements proposed are intended to 
provide a level of safety for the OHCR compartment equivalent to the 
level of safety established by existing regulations for the main cabin.
    Section 25.787(a) requires each stowage compartment in the 
passenger cabin, except for underseat and overhead compartments for 
passenger convenience, to be completely enclosed. This requirement is 
not applicable to the flight deck so that flightcrew members may 
quickly access items and better perform their duties. Occupants of the 
OHCR compartment will not be performing flight deck duties, and the FAA 
considers that stowage compartments in the OHCR compartment, except for 
under-seat compartments for occupant convenience, should be completely 
enclosed. This will provide occupants of the OHCR compartment a level 
of safety similar to that provided to main deck passengers. Note that 
typical literature pockets and magazine racks are not considered 
stowage compartments and, therefore, are not required to be completely 
enclosed by this special condition.
    The addition of galley equipment or a kitchenette incorporating a 
heat source (cook tops, microwaves, coffee pots, etc.), other than a 
conventional lavatory or kitchenette hot water heater, within the OHCR 
compartment may require further special conditions to be considered. A 
hot water heater is acceptable without further special condition 
consideration.

Applicability

    These special conditions are applicable to Boeing Model 777 series 
airplanes. Should the Boeing Commercial Airplane Group apply at a later 
date for a change to the type certificate to include another model 
incorporating the same novel or unusual design features, the special 
conditions would apply to that model as well under the provisions of 
Sec. 21.101(a)(1) Amendment 21-69, effective September 16, 1991.

List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 25

    Aircraft, Aviation safety, Reporting and recordkeeping 
requirements.
    The authority citation for these special conditions is as follows:

    Authority: 49 U.S.C. 106(g), 40113, 44701, 44702, 44704.

The Proposed Special Conditions

    Accordingly, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) proposes the 
following special conditions as part of the type certification basis 
for Boeing Model 777 series airplanes with an overhead crew rest (OHCR) 
compartment installed adjacent to or

[[Page 5752]]

immediately aft of the first pair of exits (Door 1).
    1. During flight, occupancy of the OHCR compartment is limited to 
the total number of bunks and seats installed in the compartment that 
are approved to the maximum flight loading conditions. During taxi, 
takeoff, and landing (TT&L), occupancy of the OHCR compartment is 
limited to the total number of installed seats approved to the flight 
and ground load conditions and emergency landing conditions. The OHCR 
compartment is limited to a maximum of four crewmembers during flight 
and two flightcrew members during TT&L.
    (a) There must be appropriate placards, inside and outside each 
entrance to the OHCR compartment to indicate:
    (1) The maximum number of crewmembers allowed during flight and 
flightcrew members allowed during TT&L.
    (2) That occupancy is restricted to crewmembers who the pilot in 
command has determined are trained in the evacuation procedures for the 
OHCR compartment and able to rapidly use the evacuation routes.
    (3) That smoking is prohibited in the OHCR compartment.
    (4) That stowage in the crew rest area is limited to crew personal 
luggage. The stowage of cargo or passenger baggage is not allowed.
    (b) There must be at least one ashtray on the inside and outside of 
any entrance to the OHCR compartment.
    (c) A limitation in the Airplane Flight Manual must be established 
to restrict occupancy to crewmembers who the pilot in command has 
determined are able to rapidly use the evacuation routes.
    2. The following requirements are applicable to crew rest door(s):
    (a) There must be a means for any door installed between the OHCR 
compartment and passenger cabin to be quickly opened from inside the 
OHCR compartment, even when crowding from an emergency evacuation 
occurs at each side of the door.
    (b) Doors installed across emergency egress routes must have a 
means to latch them in the open position. The latching means must be 
able to withstand the loads imposed upon it when the door is subjected 
to the ultimate inertia forces, relative to the surrounding structure, 
listed in Sec. 25.561(b).
    (c) A placard must be displayed in a conspicuous place on the 
outside of the entrance door of the OHCR compartment and any other 
door(s) installed across emergency egress routes of the OHCR 
compartment, that requires these doors to be latched open during TT&L 
when the OHCR compartment is occupied. This requirement does not apply 
to emergency escape hatches installed in the floor. A placard must be 
displayed in a conspicuous place on the entrance door to the OHCR 
compartment that requires it to be closed and locked when it is not 
occupied. Procedures for meeting these requirements must be transmitted 
to the operator for incorporation into their training programs and 
appropriate operational manuals.
    (d) For all doors installed in the OHCR compartment, there must be 
a means to preclude anyone from being trapped inside the OHCR 
compartment. If a locking mechanism is installed, it must be capable of 
being unlocked from the outside without the aid of a key or other 
special tools. The lock must not prevent opening from the inside of the 
OHCR compartment at any time.
    3. In addition to the requirements of Sec. 25.562 for seats, which 
are occupiable during takeoff and landing, and restraint systems, the 
OHCR compartment structure must be compatible with the loads imposed by 
the seats as a result of the conditions specified in Sec. 25.562(b).
    4. There must be at least two emergency evacuation routes that 
could be used by each occupant of the OHCR compartment to rapidly 
evacuate to the main cabin. In addition--
    (a) The routes must be located with sufficient separation within 
the OHCR compartment to minimize the possibility of an event either 
inside or outside of the crew rest compartment rendering both routes 
inoperative.
    Compliance to the requirements of Special Condition No. 4(a) may be 
shown by inspection or by analysis. Regardless of which method is used, 
the maximum acceptable distance between crew rest outlets is 60 feet.

Compliance by Inspection

    Inspection may be used to show compliance with Special Condition 
No. 4. An inspection finding that an OHCR compartment has evacuation 
routes located so that each occupant of the seats and berths has an 
unobstructed route to at least one of the crew rest outlets regardless 
of the location of a fire would be reason for a finding of compliance. 
A fire within a berth that only blocks the occupant of that berth from 
exiting the berth need not be considered. Therefore, crew rest outlets 
that are located at absolute opposite ends (i.e., adjacent to opposite 
end walls) of the OHCR compartment would require no further review or 
analysis with regard to their separation.

Compliance by Analysis

    Analysis must show that the OHCR compartment configuration and 
interior features allow all occupants of the OHCR compartment to escape 
the compartment in the event of a hazard inside or outside of the 
compartment. Elements to consider in this evaluation are as follows:
    (1) Fire inside or outside the OHCR compartment, considered 
separately, and the design elements used to reduce the available fuel 
for the fire.
    (2) Design elements to reduce the fire ignition sources in the OHCR 
compartment.
    (3) Distribution and quantity of emergency equipment within the 
OHCR compartment.
    (4) Structural failure or deformation of components that could 
block access to the available evacuation routes (for example seats, 
folding berths, contents of stowage compartments, etc).
    (5) An incapacitated person blocking the evacuation routes.
    (6) Any other foreseeable hazard not identified above that could 
cause the evacuation routes to be compromised.
    Analysis must consider design features affecting access to the 
evacuation routes. Possibilities for design components affecting 
evacuation that should be considered include, but are not limited to, 
seat deformations in accordance with Sec.Sec. 25.561(d) and 
25.562(c)(8), seat back break-over, rigid structure that reduces access 
from one part of the compartment to another, and items known to be the 
cause of potential hazards. Factors that also should be considered are 
availability of emergency equipment to address fire hazards, 
availability of communications equipment, supplemental restraint 
devices to retain items of mass that, if broken loose, could hinder 
evacuation, and load path isolation between components containing 
evacuation routes.
    Analysis of fire threats should be used in determining placement of 
required fire extinguishers and protective breathing equipment (PBE). 
This analysis should consider the possibility of fire in any location 
in the OHCR compartment. The location and quantity of PBE and fire 
extinguishers should allow occupants located in any approved seats or 
berths access to the equipment necessary to fight a fire in the OHCR 
compartment.
    The intent of this special condition is to provide sufficient 
egress route separation. Therefore the separation analysis described 
above should not be used to approve crew rest outlets which have less 
physical separation (measured

[[Page 5753]]

between the centroid of each outlet opening) than the minimums 
prescribed below, unless compensating features are identified and 
submitted to the FAA for evaluation and approval.
    For an OHCR compartment with one outlet located near the forward or 
aft end of the compartment (as measured by having the centroid of the 
outlet opening within 20 percent of the total length of the compartment 
from the forward or aft end of the compartment) the outlet separation 
from one outlet to the other should not be less than 50 percent of the 
total OHCR compartment length.
    For OHCR compartments with neither required crew rest outlet 
located near the forward or aft end of the OHCR compartment (as 
measured by not having the centroid of either outlet opening within 20 
percent of the forward or aft end of the total OHCR compartment 
length), the outlet separation from one outlet to the other should not 
be less than 30 percent of the total OHCR compartment length.
    (b) The routes must be designed to minimize the possibility of 
blockage, which might result from fire, mechanical or structural 
failure, or persons standing below or against crew rest outlets. One of 
the two crew rest outlets should not be located where normal movement 
or evacuation by passengers occurs (main aisle, cross aisle, or galley 
complex, for example) that would impede egress from the OHCR 
compartment. If an evacuation route is in an area where normal movement 
or evacuation of passengers occurs, it must be demonstrated that 
passengers would not impede egress to the main deck. If there is low 
headroom at or near the evacuation route, provisions must be made to 
prevent or to protect occupants (of the OHCR compartment) from head 
injury. The use of evacuation routes must not be dependent on any 
powered device. If a crew rest outlet is over an area where there are 
passenger seats, a maximum of five passengers may be displaced from 
their seats temporarily during the evacuation process of an 
incapacitated person(s). If the evacuation procedure involves the 
evacuee stepping on seats, the seats must not be damaged to the extent 
that they would not be acceptable for occupancy during an emergency 
landing.
    (c) Emergency evacuation procedures, including the emergency 
evacuation of an incapacitated occupant from the OHCR compartment, must 
be established. The applicant for a change in type design must transmit 
all of these procedures to the operator for incorporation into their 
training programs and appropriate operational manuals.
    (d) There must be a limitation in the Airplane Flight Manual or 
other suitable means requiring that crewmembers be trained in the use 
of the OHCR compartment evacuation routes. This training must instruct 
them to ensure that the OHCR compartment (including seats, doors, etc.) 
is in its proper TT&L configuration.
    (e) There must be a means to prevent passengers on the main deck 
from entering the OHCR compartment when no flight attendant is present 
or in the event of an emergency, including an emergency evacuation.
    (f) Doors or hatches that separate the OHCR compartment from the 
main deck must not adversely affect evacuation of occupants on the main 
deck (slowing evacuation by encroaching into aisles, for example) or 
cause injury to those occupants during opening or while opened.
    (g) The means of opening doors and hatches to the OHCR compartment 
must be simple and obvious. In addition, the crew rest doors and 
hatches must be able to be closed from the main passenger cabin.
    5. There must be a means for the evacuation of an incapacitated 
person (representative of a ninety-fifth percentile male) from the OHCR 
compartment to the passenger cabin floor.
    Evacuation must be demonstrated for all evacuation routes. A 
crewmember may provide assistance in the evacuation (a total of one 
assistant within the OHCR compartment). Additional assistance may be 
provided by up to three persons in the main passenger compartment. 
These additional assistants must be standing on the floor while 
providing assistance. For evacuation routes having stairways, the 
additional assistants may ascend up to one half the elevation change 
from the main deck to the OHCR compartment, or to the first landing, 
whichever is lower.
    6. The following signs and placards must be provided in the OHCR 
compartment:
    (a) At least one exit sign, located near each crew rest outlet, 
meeting the requirements of Sec. 25.812(b)(1)(i). An allowable 
exception would be a sign with reduced background area of no less than 
5.3 square inches (excluding the letters), provided that it is 
installed so that the material surrounding the exit sign is light in 
color (white, cream, light beige, for example). If the material 
surrounding the exit sign is not light in color, a sign with a minimum 
of a one-inch wide background border around the letters would be 
acceptable.
    (b) An appropriate placard must be located conspicuously on or near 
each OHCR compartment door or hatch that defines the location and the 
operating instructions for access to and operation of the outlet door 
or hatch.
    (c) Placards must be readable from a distance of 30 inches under 
emergency lighting conditions.
    (d) The door or hatch handles and operating instruction placards 
required by Special Condition No. 6(b) of these special conditions must 
be illuminated to at least 160 microlamberts under emergency lighting 
conditions.
    7. There must be a means in the event of failure of the aircraft's 
main power system, or of the normal OHCR compartment lighting system, 
for emergency illumination to be automatically provided for the OHCR 
compartment.
    (a) This emergency illumination must be independent of the main 
lighting system.
    (b) The sources of general cabin illumination may be common to both 
the emergency and the main lighting systems if the power supply to the 
emergency lighting system is independent of the power supply to the 
main lighting system.
    (c) The illumination level must be sufficient for the occupants of 
the OHCR compartment to locate and transfer to the main passenger cabin 
floor by means of each evacuation route.
    (d) The illumination level must be sufficient, with the privacy 
curtains in the closed position, for each occupant of the crew rest to 
locate a deployed oxygen mask.
    8. There must be means for two-way voice communications between 
crewmembers on the flight deck and occupants of the OHCR compartment. 
There must also be two-way communications between the occupants of the 
OHCR compartment and each flight attendant station required to have a 
public address system microphone per Sec. 25.1423(g) in the passenger 
cabin. In addition, the public address system must include provisions 
to provide only the relevant information to the crewmembers in the OHCR 
compartment (for example fire in flight, aircraft depressurization, 
preparation of the compartment for landing, etc.). That is, provisions 
must be made so that occupants of the OHCR compartment will not be 
disturbed with normal, non-emergency announcements made to the 
passenger cabin.
    9. There must be a means for manual activation of an aural 
emergency alarm system, audible during normal and

[[Page 5754]]

emergency conditions, to enable crewmembers on the flight deck and at 
each pair of required floor level emergency exits to alert occupants of 
the OHCR compartment of an emergency situation. Use of a public address 
or crew interphone system will be acceptable, provided an adequate 
means of differentiating between normal and emergency communications is 
incorporated. The system must be powered in flight, after the shutdown 
or failure of all engines and auxiliary power units (APU), for a period 
of at least ten minutes.
    10. There must be a means, readily detectable by seated or standing 
occupants of the OHCR compartment, to indicate when seat belts should 
be fastened. Seat belt type restraints must be provided for berths and 
must be compatible with the sleeping position during cruise conditions. 
There must be a placard on each berth requiring that these restraints 
be fastened when occupied. If compliance with any of the other 
requirements of these special conditions is predicated on specific head 
location, there must be a placard identifying the head position.
    11. Protective breathing equipment (PBE) must be provided in 
accordance with Sec. 25.1439, except that in lieu of a device for each 
crewmember, the following must be provided: Two PBE devices approved to 
Technical Standard Order (TSO)-C116 or equivalent, suitable for 
firefighting, or one PBE for each hand-held fire extinguisher, 
whichever is greater. The following equipment must also be provided in 
the OHCR compartment:
    (a) At least one approved hand-held fire extinguisher appropriate 
for the kinds of fires likely to occur.
    (b) One flashlight.

    Note:
    Additional PBE and fire extinguishers in specific locations, 
beyond the minimum numbers prescribed in Special Condition No. 11, 
may be required as a result of the egress analysis accomplished to 
satisfy Special Condition No. 4(a).

    12. A smoke or fire detection system (or systems) must be provided 
that monitors each occupiable area within the OHCR compartment, 
including those areas partitioned by curtains. Flight tests must be 
conducted to show compliance with this requirement. Each system (or 
systems) must provide:
    (a) A visual indication to the flight deck within one minute after 
the start of a fire.
    (b) An aural warning in the OHCR compartment.
    (c) A warning in the main passenger cabin. This warning must be 
readily detectable by a flight attendant, taking into consideration the 
positioning of flight attendants throughout the main passenger 
compartment during various phases of flight.
    13. Means to fight a fire must be provided. The means can either be 
a built-in extinguishing system or manual hand-held bottle 
extinguishing system.
    (a) For a built-in extinguishing system:
    (1) The system must have adequate capacity to suppress a fire 
considering the fire threat, volume of the compartment, and the 
ventilation rate. The system must have sufficient extinguishing agent 
to provide an initial knockdown and suppression environment per the 
minimum performance standards (MPS) that have been established for the 
agent being used.
    (2) If the capacity of the extinguishing system does not provide 
effective fire suppression that will last for the duration of flight 
from the farthest point in route to the nearest suitable landing site 
expected in service, an additional manual firefighting procedure must 
be established. For the built-in extinguishing system, the time 
duration for effective fire suppression must be established and 
documented in the firefighting procedures in the airplane flight 
manual. If the duration of time for demonstrated effective fire 
suppression provided by the built-in extinguishing agent will be 
exceeded, the firefighting procedures must instruct the crew to:
    1. Enter the crew rest at the time that demonstrated fire 
suppression effectiveness will be exceeded.
    2. Check for and extinguish any residual fire.
    3. Confirm that the fire is out.
    (b) For either a built-in extinguishing system of limited 
suppression duration or a manual hand held bottle-extinguishing system:
    (1) There must be a limitation in the Airplane Flight Manual or 
other suitable means requiring that crewmembers be trained in the 
firefighting procedures.
    (2) The compartment design must allow crewmembers equipped for 
firefighting to have unrestricted access to all parts of the 
compartment. The firefighting procedures must describe the methods for 
searching the crew rests for fire sources(s).
    (3) The time for a crewmember on the main deck to react to the fire 
alarm, don the firefighting equipment, and gain access to the crew rest 
compartment must not exceed the time for the compartment to become 
smoke-filled, making it difficult to locate the fire source.
    14. There must be a means provided to exclude hazardous quantities 
of smoke or extinguishing agent originating in the OHCR compartment 
from entering any other occupiable compartment.
    (a) Small quantities of smoke may penetrate from the crew rest 
compartment into other occupied areas during the one-minute smoke 
detection time.
    (b) There must be a provision in the firefighting procedures to 
ensure that all door(s) and hatch(es) at the crew rest compartment 
outlets are closed after evacuation of the crew rest and during 
firefighting to minimize smoke and extinguishing agent from entering 
other occupiable compartments.
    (c) Smoke entering any occupiable compartment when access to the 
OHCR compartment is open for evacuation of the crew rest must dissipate 
within five minutes after the access to the OHCR compartment is closed.
    (d) Hazardous quantities of smoke may not enter any occupied 
compartment during subsequent access to manually fight a fire in the 
crew rest compartment. The amount of smoke entrained by a firefighter 
exiting the crew rest compartment is not considered hazardous.
    (e) Flight tests must be conducted to show compliance with this 
requirement.
    15. There must be a supplemental oxygen system equivalent to that 
provided for main deck passengers for each seat and berth in the OHCR 
compartment. The system must provide an aural and visual warning to 
alert the occupants of the OHCR compartment to don oxygen masks in the 
event of decompression. The warning must activate before the cabin 
pressure altitude exceeds 15,000 feet. The aural warning must sound 
continuously for a minimum of five minutes or until a reset push button 
in the OHCR compartment is depressed. Procedures for crew rest 
occupants in the event of decompression must be established. These 
procedures must be transmitted to the operators for incorporation into 
their training programs and appropriate operational manuals.
    16. The following requirements apply to OHCR compartments that are 
divided into several sections by the installation of curtains or 
partitions:
    (a) To compensate for sleeping occupants, an aural alert that can 
be heard in each section of the OHCR compartment must accompany 
automatic presentation of supplemental oxygen masks. A visual indicator 
that occupants must don an oxygen mask is required in each section 
where seats or berths are not installed. A minimum of two supplemental 
oxygen masks are required for each seat or berth. There

[[Page 5755]]

must also be a means by which the oxygen masks can be manually deployed 
from the flight deck.
    (b) A placard is required adjacent to each curtain that visually 
divides or separates, for privacy purposes, the OHCR compartment into 
small sections. The placard must require that the curtain(s) remains 
open when the private section it creates is unoccupied. The vestibule 
section adjacent to the stairway is not considered a private area and, 
therefore, does not require a placard.
    (c) For each section of the OHCR compartment created by the 
installation of a curtain, requirements for the following must be met 
with the curtain open or closed:
    (1) No smoking placard (Special Condition No. 1).
    (2) Emergency illumination (Special Condition No. 7).
    (3) Emergency alarm system (Special Condition No. 9).
    (4) Seat belt fasten signal or return to seat signal as applicable 
(Special Condition No. 10).
    (5) The smoke or fire detection system (Special Condition No. 12).
    (d) OHCR compartments visually divided to the extent that 
evacuation could be affected must have exit signs that direct occupants 
to the primary stairway outlet. The exit signs must be provided in each 
separate section of the OHCR compartment, except for curtained bunks, 
and must meet the requirements of Sec. 25.812(b)(1)(i). An exit sign 
with reduced background area as described in Special Condition No. 6(a) 
may be used to meet this requirement.
    (e) For sections within an OHCR compartment that are created by the 
installation of a partition with a door separating the sections, the 
following requirements of these special conditions must be met with the 
door open or closed:
    (1) There must be a secondary evacuation route from each section to 
the main deck, or alternatively, it must be shown that any door between 
the sections has been designed to preclude anyone from being trapped 
inside a section of the compartment. Removal of an incapacitated 
occupant from within this area must be considered. A secondary 
evacuation route from a small room designed for only one occupant for 
short time duration, such as a changing area or lavatory, is not 
required. However, removal of an incapacitated occupant from within a 
small room, such as a changing area or lavatory, must be considered.
    (2) Any door between the sections must be shown to be openable when 
crowded against, even when crowding occurs at each side of the door.
    (3) There may be no more than one door between any seat or berth 
and the primary stairway door.
    (4) There must be exit signs in each section meeting the 
requirements of Sec. 25.812(b)(1)(i) that direct occupants to the 
primary stairway outlet. An exit sign with reduced background area as 
described in Special Condition No. 6(a) may be used to meet this 
requirement.
    (5) Special Conditions No. 1 (no smoking placards), No. 7 
(emergency illumination), No. 9 (emergency alarm system), No. 10 
(fasten seat belt signal or return to seat signal as applicable) and 
No. 12 (smoke or fire detection system) must be met with the door open 
or closed.
    (6) Special Conditions No. 8 (two-way voice communication) and No. 
11 (emergency firefighting and protective equipment) must be met 
independently for each separate section except for lavatories or other 
small areas that are not intended to be occupied for extended periods 
of time.
    17. Where a waste disposal receptacle is fitted, it must be 
equipped with an automatic fire extinguisher that meets the performance 
requirements of Sec. 25.854(b).
    18. Materials (including finishes or decorative surfaces applied to 
the materials) must comply with the requirements of Sec. 25.853 as 
amended by Amendment 25-83. Seat cushions and mattresses must comply 
with the flammability requirements of Sec. 25.853(c), as amended by 
Amendment 25-83, and the test requirements of part 25, appendix F, part 
II, or other equivalent methods.
    19. The addition of a lavatory within the OHCR compartment would 
require the lavatory to meet the same requirements as those for a 
lavatory installed on the main deck except with regard to Special 
Condition No. 12 for smoke detection.
    20. Each stowage compartment in the crew rest, except for underseat 
compartments for occupant convenience, must be completely enclosed. All 
enclosed stowage compartments within the OHCR compartment that are not 
limited to stowage of emergency equipment or airplane supplied 
equipment must meet the design criteria given in the table below. 
Enclosed stowage compartments greater than 200 ft\3\ in interior volume 
are not addressed by this special condition. The in-flight 
accessibility of very large enclosed stowage compartments and the 
subsequent impact on the crewmembers' ability to effectively reach any 
part of the compartment with the contents of a hand fire extinguisher 
will require additional fire protection considerations similar to those 
required for inaccessible compartments such as Class C cargo 
compartments.

\1\Material
The material used to construct each enclosed stowage compartment must at least be fire resistant and must meet
  the flammability standards established for interior components (i.e., 14 CFR part 25 Appendix F, Parts I, IV,
  and V) per the requirements of Sec. 25.853. For compartments less than 25 ft\3\ in interior volume, the design
  must ensure the ability to contain a fire likely to occur within the compartment under normal use.
\2\ Smoke or Fire Detectors
Enclosed stowage compartments equal to or exceeding 25 ft\3\ in interior volume must be provided with a smoke or
  fire detection system to ensure that a fire can be detected within a one-minute detection time. Flight tests
  must be conducted to show compliance with this requirement. Each system (or systems) must provide:
(a) A visual indication in the flight deck within one minute after the start of a fire.
(b) An aural warning in the OHCR compartment.

[[Page 5756]]


(c) A warning in the main passenger cabin. This warning must be readily detectable by a flight attendant, taking
  into consideration the positioning of flight attendants throughout the main passenger compartment during
  various phases of flight.
\3\ Liner
If it can be shown that the material used to construct the stowage compartment meets the flammability
  requirements of a liner for a Class B cargo compartment (i.e., Sec. 25.855 at Amendment 25-93, and Appendix F,
  part I, paragraph (a)(2)(ii)), then no liner would be required for enclosed stowage compartments equal to or
  greater than 25 ft\3\ in interior volume but less than 57 ft\3\ in interior volume. For all enclosed stowage
  compartments equal to or greater than 57 ft\3\ in interior volume but less than or equal to 200 ft\3\, a liner
  must be provided that meets the requirements of Sec. 25.855 for a Class B cargo compartment.
\4\ Location Detector
OHCR compartments that contain enclosed stowage compartments exceeding 25 ft\3\ in interior volume and are
  located away from one central location such as the entry to the OHCR compartment or a common area within the
  OHCR compartment would require additional fire protection features and/or devices to assist the firefighter in
  determining the location of a fire.
