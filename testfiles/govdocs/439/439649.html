<p align="center">ERIE RAILROAD COMPANY--ARBITRATION REVIEW--

<p align="center">UNITED STEEL WORKERS OF AMERICA

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center">Decided: December 16, 1998

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	The United Steel Workers of America (USWA) has appealed the decision of Arbitrator
Helen M. Witt entered on October 21, 1997, which imposed an implementing agreement under
which the Union Railroad Company (URR) and the Bessemer and Lake Erie Railroad Company
(B&amp;LE) (jointly, the Carriers) plan to consolidate functions currently performed by each
Carrier's accounting department.  We decline review of the arbitration decision.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center">BACKGROUND

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	In <u>Blackstone Capital Partners, L.P., Blackstone Transportation Partners L.P. and USX
Corporation--Exemption from 49 U.S.C. 10746, 11321 and 11343</u>, Finance Docket No. 31363
(ICC served Dec. 23, 1988) (<u>Blackstone</u>), the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) exempted
from the prior approval requirements now contained in 49 U.S.C. 11323 the transfer of control of
URR, B&amp;LE and five other rail carriers and one water carrier from USX Corporation (USX) to
Transtar, Inc. (Transtar), a noncarrier holding company.<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a>  The transaction was subjected to the
employee protective conditions in <u>New York Dock Ry.--Control--Brooklyn Eastern Dist</u>., 360
I.C.C. 60 (1979) (<u>New York Dock</u>).  Under <u>New York Dock</u>, labor changes related to approved
transactions are effected through implementing agreements negotiated before the changes occur. 
If the parties cannot agree, the issues are resolved by arbitration, subject to limited review by the
Board.   

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	URR, B&amp;LE, and the other rail carrier subsidiaries of Transtar had maintained separate
accounting departments in different locations.  The clerical employees for each carrier performed
work solely for their own employer, under separate collective bargaining agreements.  URR's
accounting department employees are represented by USWA, while B&amp;LE's accounting
department employees are represented by the Transportation Communications International
Union (TCU).<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a>  Apparently, URR employees worked side-by-side with B&amp;LE employees in the
same facility in Monroeville, PA.  According to the Carriers, Transtar formulated a plan to
consolidate the accounting and clerical functions of all of its carrier subsidiaries into its
Monroeville, PA facility to be managed by B&amp;LE.  The Carriers stated that the plan was part of
the process for realizing benefits from Transtar's common control over its carrier subsidiaries.<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a> 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	On September 3, 1996, URR and B&amp;LE notified the USWA and TCU by letter that they
wanted to coordinate work of their accounting departments, citing Article I, section 4 of the <u>New
York  Dock</u> conditions imposed in <u>Blackstone</u>.  The letter indicated that the work performed by
nine URR employees would be transferred to B&amp;LE, and that B&amp;LE would increase its staff by
nine new clerical positions.  The letter further stated that employees adversely affected by the
coordination would be accorded benefits under <u>New York Dock</u>.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	On October 9, 1996, USWA advised the Carriers that it would not participate in
negotiations under the <u>New York Dock</u> conditions to transfer URR work, contending that the
coordination should be governed by the Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C. 156 (RLA).  USWA
maintained that its collective bargaining agreement with URR precluded URR from assigning its
clerical work to B&amp;LE employees.  USWA further asserted that it was not a party to any other
agreement that would authorize URR's actions, such as the Washington Job Protection
Agreement of 1936 (WJPA).  Instead, the USWA informed the URR that it considered the
Carriers' <u>New York Dock</u> notice as a notice of intended change in agreements under section 6 of
the RLA and that it would negotiate over those changes.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	On October 26, 1996, URR and B&amp;LE informed USWA that they were submitting the
dispute to arbitration under Article I, section 4 of <u>New York Dock</u>.  URR also submitted a
proposed implementing agreement, under which the nine URR employees would be transferred
to the B&amp;LE.  The proposed agreement further provided that the nine former URR employees
would be represented by the TCU and would be covered by the B&amp;LE-TCU collective
bargaining agreement for accounting employees. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	In a letter dated November 1, 1996, the USWA informed the URR that it considered the
Carriers' invocation of the <u>New York Dock</u> arbitration procedures to be a unilateral and
constructive termination of conferences under section 6 of the RLA.  USWA also advised URR
that it would not participate in the selection of an arbitrator to hear the dispute under the <u>New
York Dock</u> conditions.  On November 4, 1996, the URR requested that the National Mediation
Board (NMB) appoint a neutral referee to arbitrate the dispute.  On November 19, 1996, USWA
informed the NMB that it would not participate in the selection of a neutral referee.  The NMB
appointed Arbitrator Witt to sit as the neutral referee.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	On November 18, 1996, URR filed an action before the United States District Court for
the Western District of Pennsylvania (District Court), seeking a declaratory order and injunction
contending that USWA's section 6 notice was premature.  USWA counterclaimed that the
provisions of the RLA govern the dispute rather than <u>New York Dock</u>, and that the arbitration
would violate its rights under the RLA.  As discussed later in this decision, the court
subsequently rejected this position.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	The issue of our jurisdiction over this dispute was also raised in a petition for declaratory
order that was filed on November 20, 1996, by the Carriers in STB Finance Docket 31363 (Sub-No. 2), <u>Union Railroad Company and Bessemer and Lake Erie Railroad Company--Petition</u>
(<u>Union R. Petition</u>).  The Carriers requested that the Board determine that it has exclusive
jurisdiction to resolve any dispute arising from implementing the proposed coordination.  On
December 13, 1996, USWA replied, contending that the Board did not have jurisdiction over the
dispute.  The Carriers filed a rebuttal on January 3, 1997.  Action on the Carriers' petition was
deferred because the dispute had been submitted to arbitration.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	A hearing was held before Arbitrator Witt on April 29, 1997, at Pittsburgh, PA.  Despite
USWA's objections, it participated in the arbitral proceeding.  The arbitrator issued her award on
October 21, 1997, in which she imposed an implementing agreement for the coordination of the
Carriers' accounting departments. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	The arbitrator noted that, under the proposed agreement submitted by the Carriers,
individual employees who left their employment with URR would follow their work to become
employees of B&amp;LE.  Current members of the craft or class of URR employees would be offered
employment by B&amp;LE, which they would be free to accept or refuse.  The arbitrator indicated
that those employees who accept employment would be covered by an agreement produced by
the arbitration, but those employees who reject employment with B&amp;LE would forfeit protection
and could be furloughed.  She noted that USWA had declined to submit a proposed
implementing agreement.  Therefore, she had to decide what modifications were needed, if any,
to the Carriers' proposed implementing agreement to fairly protect the URR employees.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	The arbitrator modified Paragraph 1 of the implementing agreement to clarify the rights
of URR clerical employees who decline to accept newly established B&amp;LE positions.  She also 
changed the timing for implementing the transaction.  The arbitrator amended Paragraph 9 to
provide that the implementing agreement would become effective upon 30 days' notice to the
USWA, rather than the 5 days' notice which the proposed agreement provided for.  Apparently,
the Carriers accepted the arbitrator's modifications.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	On November 10, 1997, USWA filed an appeal of the arbitrator's decision and the
Carriers replied on December 22, 1997.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center">DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><u>Jurisdiction</u>.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	USWA initially questions whether the Board has jurisdiction to decide the dispute.  As
we noted, the jurisdiction issue had been raised in URR's petition for declaratory order in <u>Union
R. Petition</u>.  There, USWA, noting that the issue was also being considered by the District Court,
requested that arbitration be held in abeyance until the court determined whether the dispute
should be resolved under <u>New York Dock</u>.  The arbitrator declined the request.  In its appeal,
USWA continues to assert that the dispute is subject to the procedures in the RLA and that the
Board lacks jurisdiction to determine whether the URR's contractual obligations and RLA
obligations have been preempted by 49 U.S.C. 11326. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Shortly after USWA filed its appeal of the arbitration decision, the District Court issued
its decision and ruled that the Board, rather than the court, has exclusive jurisdiction to determine
whether the <u>New York Dock</u> process was properly invoked to resolve the dispute.<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a>  In support,
the court cited <u>Railway Labor Executives' Ass'n. v. Southern Pacific Transp. Co.</u>, 7 F.3d 902,
906 (9th Cir. 1993); <u>Brotherhood Ry. Carmen, Div. of Transp. Comm. Int'l Union v. CSX
Transp. Inc.</u>, 855 F.2d 745, 748-49 (11th Cir. 1988), <u>cert.</u> <u>denied</u>, 489 U.S. 1016 (1989); and
<u>CSX Transp. Inc. v. United Transp. Union</u>, 86 F.3d 346 (4th Cir. 1996), which upheld the
Board's exclusive authority to resolve labor disputes when implementing a Board-approved
transaction.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	These decisions, in turn, relied on precedent which established that the Board's approval
of a transaction automatically removes its implementation from the procedures of the RLA, and
that the Board or arbitrators acting under authority delegated under <u>New York Dock</u> may exempt
a transaction from the provisions of the RLA and may override collective bargaining agreements
when necessary to realize public benefits of an approved transaction.  Where modification of a
collective bargaining agreement has been necessary, it has been approved under either section
11321(a) [formerly section 11341(a)], or section 11326 [formerly section 11347].  <u>Norfolk &amp;
Western v. American Train Dispatchers</u>, 499 U.S. 117 (1991) (<u>Dispatchers)</u>; <u>Railway Labor
Executives' Ass'n v. ICC</u>, 987 F.2d 806 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (<u>RLEA</u>); <u>American Train Dispatchers
Ass'n. v. ICC</u>, 26&nbsp;F.3d 806 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (<u>ATDA</u>); and  <u>United Transp. Union v. STB</u>, 114
F.3d 1425 (D.C.&nbsp;Cir. 1997) (<u>UTU-STB</u>).   In <u>RLEA</u>, 987 F.2d at 814-15, the court indicated that
agreements may be changed if necessary to effect a public benefit that would not be available if
the agreement were left in place, but not merely to transfer wealth from employees to their
employer.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	The District Court in <u>Union RR v. USWA</u> further noted that, since USWA's
jurisdictional claim was raised after the arbitration process had begun, the union's claim could be
characterized as an impermissible collateral attack on the arbitration process.  The District Court
also rejected USWA's assertion that it did not sign the WJPA, stating that the carrier's rights are
statutory in nature and owe nothing to the WJPA.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	USWA did not appeal the District Court's decision or raise any objections to the court's
decision here.  The court's decision confirms our jurisdiction to resolve this dispute under <u>New
York Dock</u> and also upholds the arbitrator's authority to impose an implementing agreement
under the <u>New York Dock</u> procedures.   

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Another jurisdictional issue raised by USWA both here and in <u>Union R. Petition</u> is the
union's assertion that the Board is unable to issue a decision in these proceedings because we are
"unconstitutionally composed."  USWA states that the Board's members obtained their authority
pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 701(b)(4) which was enacted in the ICC Termination Act, Pub. L. No.
104-88, 109 Stat. 803 (ICCTA), which provides:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	On the effective date of this section, the members of the Interstate Commerce
Commission serving unexpired terms on the date of the enactment of the ICC
Termination Act of 1995 shall be members of the Board, to serve for a period of time
equal to the remainder of the term for which they were originally appointed to the
Interstate Commerce Commission.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	USWA asserts that Congress violated the Appointments Clause in U.S. Const., Art II &#167;2,<a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a>
because, by terminating the ICC and creating the Board, and then appointing three of the ICC's
members to be members of the Board, it infringed on the President's right to appoint principal
officers as members of the Board. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	In support, USWA cites two decisions involving the abolishment of the Federal Home
Loan Bank Board (FHLBB) and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation and the
creation of the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), a new agency.  The FHLBB had three
members.  Under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989
(FIRREA), Pub. L. No. 101-73, 103 Stat. 183 (1989), the newly formed OTS was to have only
one Director which was to be appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the
Senate.  12 U.S.C. 1462a(c)(1).  However, the statute also included a "transitional provision" in
12 U.S.C. 1462a(c)(5) which designated the chairman of the FHLBB as the first director of the
OTS.  Two courts found that, by enacting the "transitional provision" in section 1462a(c)(5),
Congress had appointed the Director of OTS and thus unconstitutionally infringed on the
President's right to appoint officers.  <u>Franklin Sav. Ass'n v. Director of Office of Thrift
Supervision</u>, 740 F. Supp. 1535 (D. Kan. 1990), and <u>Olympic Federal Sav. And Loan Ass'n. v.
Director, Office of Thrift Supervision</u>, 732 F. Supp. 1183 (D.D.C. 1990) (<u>Olympic</u>), appeal
dismissed as moot, 903 F.2d 837 (D.C. Cir 1990).  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	We do not agree with USWA that the statute which created the Board has the
unconstitutional impediments that were present when OTS was created.  In <u>Olympic</u>,
732&nbsp;F.&nbsp;Supp.&nbsp;at 1186, the court noted that:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Had OTS been placed under the supervision of a three-person board, this court believes
that the . . . three former FHLBB members would not have required re-confirmation. 
However, when Congress decided that only one of the three FHLBB members would
have his responsibilities transferred and, moreover, decided specifically which one of the
three would become the new Director, it went beyond simply changing the duties of an
office and appointed a person to a new post.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	When Congress abolished the ICC and transferred the members of the ICC to become
members of the Board, it transferred the positions of the members of the ICC to the Board, 49
U.S.C. 701(b)(4).  But, Congress did not transfer "particular" members of the ICC to the Board,
as was done when the OTS was established under FIRREA.  Thus, establishment of the Board is
consistent with the court's discussion in <u>Olympic</u> and is not a violation of the appointments
clause.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	USWA argues that the STB is without jurisdiction to override its collective bargaining
agreement under 49 U.S.C. 11341(a) [and now section 11321(a)], because 11341(a) does not
apply because the ICC used 49 U.S.C. 10505 [now 10502] to exempt the underlying control
transaction from the prior approval requirements of sections 11321 and 11343.  USWA cites in
support of its argument <u>Railroad Consolidation Procedures--Trackage Rights Exemption</u>, 1
I.C.C.2d 270 (1985) (<u>Rail Procedures</u>), and <u>RLEA</u>, <u>supra</u>.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	We disagree.  In <u>Rail Procedures</u>, the ICC indicated that its authority to approve a
transaction under section 11341(a), so that the transaction is exempt from the antitrust laws and
from all other laws as necessary, does not reach transactions under section 10505.  However,
subsequently in <u>Rio Grande Industries, et al.--Trackage Rights--Burlington Northern R.R.
Lines</u>, ICC Finance Docket No. 31730 (ICC served Mar. 12, 1991), the ICC clarified its position. 
Therein, the ICC stated that, even under the reasoning of <u>Rail Procedures</u>, the exemption
authority in section 10505 would not remove transactions exempted from section 11343 from the
reach of section 11341(a) with regard to labor protection matters.  This is so, the ICC held,
because the Commission, and the Board today, are expressly barred by the terms of the
exemption provision from using the exemption powers to derogate from the labor protection to
which employees are entitled under the relevant statutory section by which the transaction would
be approved.  The courts have been in accord with this position.<a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a>  In <u>United Transportation
Union v. Norfolk and Western Ry Co.</u>, 822 F.2d 1114, 1115 (D.C. Cir. 1987), <u>cert.</u> <u>denied</u>, 484
U.S. 1006 (1988), the court saw no basis for distinguishing between approved and exempted
transactions for purposes of the applicability of section 11341(a).  There, the court explained that
the Commission "merely substitutes one form of Commission oversight for another" when it
imposes labor protective conditions pursuant to an exemption.  <u>See</u> <u>also</u> <u>Brotherhood of
Locomotive Engineers v. Boston and Maine Corp.</u>, 788 F.2d 794 (1st Cir. 1986), <u>cert.</u> <u>denied</u>,
421 U.S. 975 (1987).  Moreover, 49 U.S.C. 11326, like its predecessor, section 11347 of the
Interstate Commerce Act, provides an independent source of authority for the Board and its
arbitrators to modify labor agreements as necessary to permit the implementation of an
authorized transaction. <u>RLEA</u> at 813-14.  <u>See</u> <u>Delaware and Hudson Railway Co.--Lease and
Trackage Rights--Springfield Terminal Company</u>, Finance Docket No. 30965 (Sub Nos. 1 and 2)
(STB served Sept. 25, 1998); <u>CSX Corporation--Control--Chessie System, Inc. and Seaboard
Coast Line Industries, Inc. (Arbitration Review)</u>, Finance Docket No 28905 (Sub-No. 22); and
<u>Norfolk Southern Corporation--Control--Norfolk and Western Railway Company and Southern
Railway Company (Arbitration Review)</u>, Finance Docket No. 29430 (Sub No. 20) (STB served
Sept. 25, 1998).  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><u>Review of the Arbitration Decision</u>.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Under 49 CFR 1115.8, the standard for review of arbitration decisions is provided in
<u>Chicago &amp; North Western Tptn. Co.-Abandonment</u>, 3 I.C.C.2d 729 (1987), <u>aff'd</u> <u>sub</u> <u>nom.</u>,
<u>International Broth. Of Elec. Workers v. ICC</u>, 862 F.2d 330 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (<u>Lace Curtain</u>). 
Under <u>Lace Curtain</u>, we accord deference to arbitrators' decisions and will not review "issues of
causation, calculation of benefits, or the resolution of factual questions" in the absence of
egregious error.  Review of arbitral decisions has been limited to "recurring or otherwise
significant issues of general importance regarding the interpretation of our labor conditions."  
We generally do not overturn an arbitral award, unless it is shown that the award is irrational or
fails to draw its essence from the imposed labor conditions or it is outside the scope of authority
granted by the conditions. <u>Id.</u> at 736.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	USWA asks us to consider whether the arbitrator exceeded her authority when she
imposed an implementing agreement and whether the award failed to preserve the rights of
affected employees.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	We find no reason to disturb the arbitrator's award under the <u>Lace Curtain</u> standards. 
There is no issue of first impression; and any issues that are likely to recur have already been
thoroughly resolved by us and the courts.  USWA has not shown egregious error or any other
grounds requiring review of the arbitration award here.  <u>See</u> <u>Employees of Butte Anaconda &amp;
Pac. Ry. v. United States</u>, 938 F.2d 1009 (9th Cir. 1991), at 1012; <u>United Transp. Union v. ICC</u>,
43 F.3d 697 (D.C. Cir. 1995), at 699; <u>CSX Transp. Inc. v. Surface Transp. Bd.</u>, 75 F.3d 696
(D.C. Cir. 1996), at 700;  <u>United Transportation Union v. Surface Transp. Bd.</u>, 114 F.3d 1242
(D.C. Cir. 1997), at 1245. And, to the extent USWA is seeking to raise an issue of representation,
such issues can be resolved only by the NMB.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Because the <u>Lace Curtain</u> standards for review have not been met here, we decline review
of the arbitration decision.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	This decision will not significantly affect either the quality of the human environment or
the conservation of energy resources.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<u>It is ordered</u>:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	1.  To the extent USWA's appeal challenges the Board's jurisdiction to address the issues
in this proceeding, it is denied.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	2.  We decline to review the award that is the subject of USWA's appeal.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	3.  The proceedings are discontinued.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	4.  This decision is effective 30 days after its service date.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	By the Board, Chairman Morgan and Vice Chairman Owen.
