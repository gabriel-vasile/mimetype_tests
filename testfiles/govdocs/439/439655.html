award of a contract to Odoi Associates, Inc., under invitation for bids (IFB)
No.&nbsp;GS11P04YED0224, for building management services.<!span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Vador principally asserts that award to Odoi
was improper becase Odoi failed to meet the definitive responsibility criteria set
forth in the solicitation. <a name=Paragraph1End></a><!span style='text-transform:

<p class=MsoBodyText><!span style='mso-no-proof:yes'></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The IFB, issued as a section 8(a) set-aside, contemplated
the award of a fixed-price contract for an initial period of one year, with 4
option years, for commercial facility management services, including operation
and maintenance services, elevator maintenance services, and custodial
services, at the <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Postal</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>Square</st1:PlaceType>

style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The IFB stated that award would be made to
the lowest-priced, responsive, responsible bidder. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The IFB set forth specific experience qualifications for
key personnel the awardee was to provide under the contract, including the
project manager, any alternate project managers, and on-site supervisory
employees.<!span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>For the project manager and
the alternate project managers, the solicitation required 4 years experience
(within the past 5&nbsp;years) “in managing the operation, maintenance and
repair, custodial services, building alterations, customer relations
requirements, and all other operational components of a building with at least
800,000 square feet of occupiable space.”<!span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>
</span>IFB, Section J, exh. 1, at 2.<!span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The
supervisory employees were to possess at least 4 years of recent (within the
past 5 years) experience “in directing personnel responsible for accomplishment
of work in their respective program area in a building of at least 800,000
square feet of occupiable office space.”<!span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>
</span><st1:State><st1:place><u>Id.</u></st1:place></st1:State> at 4. <!span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'></span>Further, the IFB required that the apparent

days after notice to the apparent low bidder</b>,” detailed personnel resumes
explaining how each individual had obtained the required experience.<!span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>IFB, amend. 4, Section J, exh. 1, at Revised
Page 2, 4 (emphasis in original).<!span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The
solicitation did not state when award would be made. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The agency received 14 bids by the closing time on April
7, including Odoi’s low bid of $10,559,398, and Vador’s second low bid of
$12,315,353.<!span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>By letter dated April 18,
the agency informed Odoi that it was the apparent low bidder, and asked that it
submit, among other things, the resumes required under the solicitation.<!span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>On April&nbsp;26, Odoi submitted the required
information, and the agency awarded the contract 3 days later. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Vador thereafter filed this protest with our Office,
alleging that the experience requirements laid out in the solicitation
constitute definitive responsibility criteria that the awardee failed to meet.<a

building.<!span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Responsibility is a term used to describe the offeror’s
ability to meet its contract obligations.<!span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>
</span><u>See</u> <u>generally</u> Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart
9.1.<!span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>In most cases, responsibility is
determined on the basis of what the FAR refers to as general standards of
responsibility, such as adequacy of financial resources, ability to meet
delivery schedules, and a satisfactory record of past performance and of
business integrity and ethics.<!span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>FAR sect.
9.104-1.<!span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>In some cases, however, an
agency will include in a solicitation a special standard of responsibility, FAR
sect. 9.104-2, which is often referred to as a definitive criterion of
responsibility.<!span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Definitive
responsibility criteria are specific and objective standards established by an
agency as a precondition to award which are designed to measure a prospective
contractor’s ability to peform the contract.<!span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>
</span>FAR sect. 9.104-2; <u>Specialty Marine, Inc.</u>, B-292053, <st1:date
Year="2003" Day="19" Month="5">May&nbsp;19, 2003</st1:date>, 2003 CPD para. 106 at
2-3.<!span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Because definitive responsibility criteria limit the
competition to those who can meet them, and because compliance with them is not
a matter of subjective business judgment but can be determined objectively,
offerors must meet such criteria as a precondition for award.<!span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>We consider protests alleging that a
contracting officer failed to enforce the criteria.<!span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span><u>The Mary Kathleen Collins Trust</u>,
B-261019.2, <st1:date Year="1995" Day="29" Month="9">Sept. 29, 1995</st1:date>,

Year="1992" Day="9" Month="10">Oct. 9, 1992</st1:date>, 92-2 CPD para.&nbsp;235. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>As a preliminary matter, GSA maintains that the experience
requirements here do not constitute definitive responsibility criteria.<!span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>This is so because, according to GSA, the
solicitation did not specifically require the apparent low bidder to submit proof
of the key personnel’s experience prior to contract award.<!span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>As stated above, definitive responsibility
criteria are special standards that must be met as a precondition for
award.<!span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>In this case, the solicitation
required that the resumes be submitted within 5 days after notification of a
firm’s apparent low bidder status, and made no reference to when award would be
made.<!span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Consequently, the agency argues,
award could have been made before the resumes were received, and thus award was
not contingent upon the potential awardee’s ability to meet the
requirements.<!span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The agency maintains that
whether the key personnel meet the experience requirements is a matter of
contract administration. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>We find this argument unpersuasive.<!span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>As noted by the agency, our Office has
dismissed protests on the ground that certain requirements (such as license
requirements) are not definitive responsibility criteria when the solicitation
does not require offerors to meet, or demonstrate the ability to meet, the
requirement prior to award.<!span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span><u>See</u>, <u>e.g.</u>,
<u>Transcontinental Enters., Inc.</u>, B-294765, <st1:date Year="2004" Day="30"
Month="11">Nov.&nbsp;30&nbsp;2004</st1:date>, 2004 CPD para.&nbsp;240 at 3
n.2.<!span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>However, while the solicitation
here did not explicitly state that the agency would evaluate the key personnel
experience prior to award, we find that in requiring submission of resumes
within 5 working days of notice to the apparent low bidder, the solicitation
reasonably indicated to bidders that the resumes would be evaluated before
award in order to determine whether the low bidder was able to comply with the
key personnel experience requirements laid out in the solicitation.<a

style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>In our view, had GSA intended the resumes to
be matters of contract administration (and not definitive responsibility
criteria), one would reasonably expect that the requirement would have been for
submission sometime after award had been made, rather than before award.<!span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>We therefore find that the key personnel
experience requirements possess all of the principal characteristics of a
definitive responsibility criterion--they concern the capability of the
offeror, not a specific product, and they are objective standards established
by the agency as a precondition to award.<!span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>
</span><u>See</u> <u>Specialty Marine, Inc.</u>, B&#8209;292053, <st1:date
Year="2003" Day="19" Month="5">May&nbsp;19, 2003</st1:date>, 2003 CPD para. 106 at
3.<!span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Vador asserts that Odoi’s key personnel failed to satisfy
the definitive responsibility criteria because they did not have experience
managing or supervising the operation of an 800,000&nbsp;square foot
building.<!span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Specifically, Vador contends
that the agency improperly waived this requirement by considering two separate
buildings, the <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Wilbur</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName>J.</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceName>Cohen</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>Building</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>

in <st1:place><st1:City>Washington</st1:City>, <st1:State>D.C.</st1:State></st1:place>,
to be one qualifying building under the solicitation’s requirements.<!span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Vador argues that because the two buildings
have different street addresses and are separated by a street, with each
building containing less than 800,000 occupiable square feet, the experience of
Odoi’s key personnel managing or supervising the operation of the two buildings
together did not satisfy the solicitation requirements. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Where, as here, a protester asserts that a definitive
responsibility criterion has not been satisfied, we will review the record to
ascertain whether evidence of compliance has been submitted from which the
contracting official reasonably could conclude that the criterion had been met;
generally, a contracting agency has broad discretion in determining whether
offerors meet definitive responsibility criteria.<!span

96-1 CPD para. 210 at&nbsp;4.<!span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Further,
literal compliance with definitive responsibility criteria is not required
where there is evidence that an offeror has exhibited a level of achievement
equivalent to the specified criteria.<!span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span><u>HAP

<p class=MsoBodyText></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>We find no basis to question the agency’s position that
experience managing or supervising the operation of the Cohen and Switzer
buildings was qualifying experience.<!span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The
Cohen and Switzer buildings, while having two separate street addresses, share
many of the same basic operating systems.<!span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>
</span>The agency reports, and the protester does not dispute, that many of the
Cohen and Switzer buildings’ electrical, mechanical, and plumbing systems are
unified operating systems with the equipment sized to operate the two buildings
together.<!span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>For example, the two buildings
share a single, common chiller system for cooling the buildings.<!span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The two buildings are serviced by a single,
common feed that supplies high pressure steam, and by a single, common
electrical feed.<!span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>(Indeed, the two
buildings are billed by the steam and electrical providers as if they were one
building.)<!span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The heating and air
conditioning of the two buildings are controlled by a single, common energy
management control system.<!span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Furthermore,
contracted commercial facilities management services for the two buildings have
always been obtained under one contract, and the buildings have always been
serviced as one.<!span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Since the combined
occupiable square footage of the two buildings is 971,425 square feet, and the
two buildings function as one building in most important respects, we find that
GSA has reasonably concluded that experience managing or supervising the
operation of the two buildings could satisfy the IFB’s requirement for experience
managing or supervising an 800,000 square foot building. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Vador asserts that considering the combined Cohen and
Switzer buildings to be a single unit is inconsistent with a question and
answer incorporated into the solicitation.<!span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

<p class=MsoBodyText></p>

<p class=Quotation>No.<!span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>A building the
size of <st1:Street><st1:address>Postal Square</st1:address></st1:Street>
presents certain complexities that need a level of experience and abilities
that can only be gained by working in a large facility.<!span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>In order to ensure we are going to get that level
of ability this requirement must be met.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>IFB, amend. 4, at 4. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>As noted by the agency, however, a complex of buildings
may contain separate systems for each building.<!span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>
</span>Here, in contrast, the Cohen and Switzer buildings operate in major
respects as one building, having integrated systems with equipment sized to
operate the two buildings together.<!span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>
</span>Thus, the agency could reasonably conclude that the experience of the
awardee’s personnel with the two buildings (totaling 971,425 square feet),
operated in major respects as one building, provided experience comparable to
that which would be obtained managing and supervising the operation of a
single, 800,000 square foot building.</p>

After receiving the agency report, Vador filed a supplemental protest on June
16, alleging that the awardee’s bid was unbalanced, that the agency failed to
perform a price reasonableness analysis of the awardee’s bid, and that the
agency improperly made an affirmative responsibility determination.<!span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>We dismiss Vador’s assertion regarding the
alleged unbalancing of the awardee’s bid as untimely filed.<!span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>According to the record, which Vador does not
challenge, Vador was emailed a copy of the bid abstract on April 21.<!span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Vador then had 10 days to protest the
awardee’s pricing; its failure to do so renders this ground untimely.<!span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>4 C.F.R. sect.&nbsp;21.2(a)(2) (2005).<!span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Further, Vador’s assertion that the agency
did not properly evaluate the reasonableness of Odoi’s low price provides no basis
to question the award, since a price reasonableness evaluation is intended to
determine whether offered prices are higher than warranted, not lower.<!span

Indeed, further evidence that the solicitation requirement for submission of
resumes “within 5&nbsp;working days after notice to the apparent low bidder”
was intended to result in submission of the resumes prior to award is found in
the fact that the solicitation included a requirement that information demonstrating
compliance with certain contractor experience requirements be submitted “within
5&nbsp;working days after notice to the apparent low bidder” and specifically
stated that such information “will be examined for authenticity prior to
contract award.”<!span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>IFB, amend. 4, Section
