The current NIH campus employee population of about 16,325 is projected to fall to about 15,000 in the year 2000 due to government downsizing and budget constraint programs. Beyond 2000, a slow growth in campus employee population, most of which will occur in the last half of the planning period, is anticipated. By 2015, the number of NIH employees on campus is projected to be approximately 18,000. Increases in intramural researchers and laboratory workers will account for most of the employee increase.&nbsp;</font></span>

mso-bidi-language:AR-SA"><font color="#004040">While the Master Plan makes relatively specific estimates for growth in campus population and facilities over the next 20 years, actual growth on campus will depend on future congressional and presidential policy decisions, as well as Federal budgetary constraints. Changes in national health policy could occur over the next decade, and NIH's mission could be significantly affected as a result. The Master Plan is a guiding map on how growth would take place on the Bethesda campus, were it to occur. The growth anticipated in the Master Plan may not occur to the extent indicated.&nbsp;</font></span>
