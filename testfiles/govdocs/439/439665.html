<b>The Amendment </b><br>
<br>
In consideration of the foregoing, the Federal Aviation Administration amends parts 25 and 121 of Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations as follows: <br>
<br>
<b>PART 25--AIRWORTHINESS STANDARDS: TRANSPORT CATEGORY AIRPLANES </b><br>
<br>
1. The authority citation for part 25 continues to read as follows: <br>
<br>
	Authority: 49 U.S.C. 106(g), 40113, 44701, 44702, 44704. <br>
<br>
2. Section 25.809 is amended by revising paragraph (a), and by adding a new paragraph (i) to read as follows: <br>
<br>
<b>Sec.  25.809  Emergency exit arrangement. <br>
</b><br>
	(a) Each emergency exit, including each flightcrew emergency exit, must be a moveable door or hatch in the external walls of the fuselage, allowing an unobstructed opening to the outside. In addition, each emergency exit must have means to permit viewing of the conditions outside the exit when the exit is closed. The viewing means may be on or adjacent to the exit provided no obstructions exist between the exit and the viewing means. Means must also be provided to permit viewing of the likely areas of evacuee ground contact. The likely areas of evacuee ground contact must be viewable during all lighting conditions with the landing gear extended as well as in all conditions of landing gear collapse. <br>
* * * * *<br>
	(i) Each emergency exit must have a means to retain the exit in the open position, once the exit is opened in an emergency. The means must not require separate action to engage when the exit is opened, and must require positive action to disengage. <br>
<br>
3. Section Sec.  25.812 is amended by revising paragraphs (g)(1)(ii), (g)(2), and (h) introductory text to read as follows: <br>
<br>
<b>Sec.  25.812  Emergency lighting. </b><br>
<br>
<br>
* * * * *<br>
<br>
	(g) * * * <br>
	(1) * * * <br>
	(i) * * * <br>
	(ii) Not less than 0.05 foot-candle (measured normal to the direction of the incident light) for a minimum width of 42 inches for a Type A overwing emergency exit and two feet for all other overwing emergency exits along the 30 percent of the slip-resistant portion of the escape route required in Sec.  25.810(c) that is farthest from the exit; and <br>
* * * * *<br>
<br>
	(2) At each non-overwing emergency exit not required by Sec. 25.810(a) to have descent assist means the illumination must be not less than 0.03 foot-candle (measured normal to the direction of the incident light) on the ground surface with the landing gear extended where an evacuee is likely to make first contact with the ground outside the cabin. <br>
	(h) The means required in Secs.  25.810(a) and (d) to assist the occupants in descending to the ground must be illuminated so that the erected assist means is visible from the airplane. <br>
* * * * *<br>
<br>
<br>
4. Section 25.813 is amended by revising paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2) and (b)(3), by adding new paragraphs (b)(4), (b)(5) and (b)(6) and by revising paragraphs (e) and (f) to read as follows: <br>

	(1) Each assist space must be a rectangle on the floor, of sufficient size to enable a crewmember, standing erect, to effectively assist evacuees. The assist space must not reduce the unobstructed width of the passageway below that required for the exit. <br>
	(2) For each Type A or B exit, assist space must be provided at each side of the exit regardless of whether an assist means is required by Sec.  25.810(a). <br>
	(3) For each Type C, I or II exit installed in an airplane with seating for more than 80 passengers, an assist space must be provided at one side of the passageway regardless of whether an assist means is required by Sec.  25.810(a). <br>
	(4) For each Type C, I or II exit, an assist space must be provided at one side of the passageway if an assist means is required by Sec. 25.810(a). <br>
	(5) For any tailcone exit that qualifies for 25 additional passenger seats under the provisions of Sec.  25.807(d)(3)(ii), an assist space must be provided, if an assist means is required by Sec. 25.810(a). <br>
	(6) There must be a handle, or handles, at each assist space, located to enable the crewmember to steady himself or herself: <br>
	(i) While manually activating the assist means (where applicable) and, <br>
	(ii) While assisting passengers during an evacuation. <br>
* * * * *<br>
<br>
	(e) No door may be installed between any passenger seat that is occupiable for takeoff and landing and any passenger emergency exit, such that the door crosses any egress path (including aisles, crossaisles and passageways). <br>
	(f) If it is necessary to pass through a doorway separating any crewmember seat (except those seats on the flightdeck), occupiable for takeoff and landing, from any emergency exit, the door must have a means to latch it in the open position. The latching means must be able to withstand the loads imposed upon it when the door is subjected to the ultimate inertia forces, relative to the surrounding structure, listed in Sec.  25.561(b). <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
5.-6. Section Sec.  25.853 is amended by revising paragraph (f) to read as follows: <br>

* * * * *<br>
<br>
7. The introductory text in Sec.  25.855 is revised to read as follows: <br>

* * * * *<br>
<br>
9. Section 25.1447 is amended by revising paragraph (c)(4) to read as follows: <br>

<b>Sec.  121.310  Additional emergency equipment. </b><br>
<br>
* * * * *<br>
<br>
	(f) * * * <br>
	(2) For each Type I or Type II emergency exit equipped with an assist means, there must be enough space next to the exit to allow a crewmember to assist in the evacuation of passengers without reducing the unobstructed width of the passageway below that required in paragraph (f)(1) of this section. In addition, all airplanes manufactured on or after November 26, 2008 must comply with the provisions of Secs.  25.813(b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3) and (b)(4) in effect on November 26, 2004.
