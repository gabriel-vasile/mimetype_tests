Highlights of GAO-03-747, a report to Congressional Requesters 

Why GAO Did This Study:

The federal government has many vacant and underutilized properties 
that are no longer needed. Retaining unneeded real properties presents 
federal agencies with significant potential risks for (1) lost dollars 
because such properties are costly to maintain; and (2) lost 
opportunities because the properties could be put to more cost-
beneficial uses, exchanged for other needed property, or sold to 
generate revenue for the government. 

The General Services Administration (GSA), the Department of Veterans 
Affairs (VA), and the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) hold a significant 
number of real property assets. GAO was asked to provide information 
on how these agencies identify vacant and underutilized real 
properties and the numbers, types, and locations of these properties.

What GAO Found:

* GSA, VA, and USPS primarily rely on field office officials to 
identify vacant and underutilized properties. These officials make on-
site property visits, communicate with tenant agencies about lease 
renewals, and examine agency program requirements that will affect 
agencies’ real property needs. These three agencies also have ongoing 
nationwide initiatives to realign their real property portfolios. GSA 
officials are reviewing all of its properties to identify and remove 
all assets from its real property inventory that are not financially 
self-sustaining or for which there is not a substantial, long-term 
federal purpose. VA officials are in the process of identifying 
unneeded real property assets to reduce VA’s large inventory of vacant 
and underutilized buildings. USPS officials are reviewing and 
modifying its postal real property infrastructure so that USPS can 
enhance customer service and control costs through the closing and 
consolidation of unneeded facilities, such as some post offices.

* As of October 1, 2002, these agencies reported a total of 927 vacant 
and underutilized real properties—including facilities and land—
located throughout the United States and Puerto Rico in 294 cities. VA 
reported the most properties—577; GSA reported 236 properties, and 
USPS reported 114 properties. Most of these properties—807 of 927—were 
facilities that represented about 32.1 million square feet and ranged 
from office buildings to hospitals to post offices. Although VA 
reported the highest number of facilities, GSA facilities made up more 
than half of this square footage. The remaining 120 properties were 
vacant lands reported only by VA and USPS, most of which were 10 acres 
or less.

* GSA said that 236 properties is an overstatement because 43 
properties are committed to future use, and 37 small properties 
support occupiable space. GAO did not change GSA’s total number of 
properties because they were vacant or underutilized as of October 1, 
2002. However, GAO reflected GSA’s concern in the text and in the list 
of GSA’s properties. VA and USPS generally agreed with the information 
in this report.

Letter August 19, 2003:

Congressional Requesters:

This report responds to your request for information on vacant and 
underutilized real property controlled by three federal agencies--the 
General Services Administration (GSA), the Department of Veterans 
Affairs (VA), and the U.S. Postal Service (USPS).[Footnote 1] As 
discussed in our January 2003 high-risk report on federal real 
property, over 30 agencies control hundreds of thousands of real 
property assets worldwide that are worth hundreds of billions of 
dollars.[Footnote 2] However, many of these assets, which include 
vacant and underutilized properties, are no longer needed because of 
significant changes in the size and mission needs of federal agencies. 
Unneeded assets present significant potential risks to federal agencies 
not only for lost dollars because such properties are costly to 
maintain but also for lost opportunities because the properties could 
be put to more cost-beneficial uses, exchanged for other needed 
property, or sold to generate revenue for the government. In addition, 
continuing to hold real property that may no longer be needed does not 
present a positive image of the federal government in local 
communities. Instead, it can present an image of waste and inefficiency 
that erodes taxpayers' confidence and can have a negative impact on 
local economies if the property is occupying a valuable location and is 
not used for other purposes, sold, or used in a public-private 
partnership if such a partnership provides the best economic value for 
the government.[Footnote 3]

As of September 30, 2000, the federal government owned about 3 billion 
square feet of building floor space worldwide.[Footnote 4] You asked us 
to provide information on (1) how GSA, VA, and USPS--the largest 
nondefense holders of federally owned space--identify vacant and 
underutilized properties; and (2) the numbers, types, and locations of 
these properties.[Footnote 5] To meet the first objective, we discussed 
and documented real property procedures and practices with federal 
officials at the three agencies, including how they identified these 
properties. For the second objective, we obtained and analyzed 
information on GSA's, VA's Veterans Health Administration, and USPS's 
vacant and underutilized properties. A more detailed discussion of our 
objectives, scope, and methodology is included in appendix I.

Results In Brief:

GSA, VA, and USPS rely primarily on their agencies' real property 
officials in field office locations to identify vacant and 
underutilized properties. According to agency officials and current 
agency policies and procedures, field office officials identify such 
properties through the daily management and oversight of their real 
property portfolios. Some specific steps these officials use to 
identify vacant and underutilized property include on-site property 
visits, communications with tenant agencies about lease renewals, and 
examinations of agency program requirements that will affect agencies' 
real property needs. Also, all three agencies have recognized the 
importance of realigning their real property portfolios by identifying 
and disposing of unneeded real property.

* In June 2001, GSA started an overall effort, commonly referred to as 
the portfolio restructuring initiative, in which GSA officials are 
reviewing all of its properties nationwide to identify and remove all 
assets from its real property inventory, including vacant and 
underutilized properties, that are not financially self-sustaining or 
for which there is not a substantial, long-term federal purpose.

* In October 2000, VA began a process known as the Capital Asset 
Realignment for Enhanced Services that is intended to strategically 
realign its real property assets to better serve veterans' health 
needs. One of the process' major objectives is to reduce VA's large 
inventory of vacant and underutilized buildings and the significant 
costs needed to maintain these buildings.

* USPS, faced with such challenges as changing customer needs, 
declining mail volumes, rising costs, and increasing security concerns, 
issued a transformation plan in April 2002. Among other things, the 
plan discussed the need for USPS to review and modify its 
infrastructure of postal facilities so that it can enhance customer 
service and control costs through the closing and consolidation of 
unneeded postal facilities, such as some post offices.

As of October 1, 2002, GSA, VA, and USPS reported having a total of 927 
vacant and underutilized real properties that included a wide range of 
facilities--such as office buildings, hospitals, and post offices--and 
land located throughout the 50 states and in the District of Columbia 
and Puerto Rico. As shown in figure 1, VA reported the highest number 
of vacant and underutilized real properties.

Reported by GSA, VA, and USPS as of October 1, 2002:

[End of figure]

More of the 927 properties--600, or about 65 percent--were vacant 
compared with the remaining 327, or about 35 percent, which were 
underutilized properties. Further, most of the vacant and underutilized 
properties--807 of 927, or about 87 percent--were facilities and ranged 
from office buildings and storage facilities to hospitals and medical 
centers to post offices. These facilities represented about 32.1 
million square feet of space. Although VA reported having the highest 
number of vacant and underutilized facilities, GSA's vacant and 
underutilized facilities made up more than half of this square footage. 
The sizes of the 3 agencies' facilities ranged from less than 10,000 
square feet to more than 100,000 square feet, with about half of the 
facilities measuring less than 10,000 square feet. The 120 land 
properties were owned by VA and USPS and ranged in size from less than 
1 acre to 174 acres. The three agencies' vacant and underutilized 
properties were located in 294 cities throughout the United States and 
Puerto Rico. The highest numbers of vacant and underutilized properties 
were reported for Los Angeles, California, which had a total of 54 
properties; and Fort Howard, Maryland, which had a total of 43 
properties.

In commenting on a draft of this report, the Commissioner of GSA's 
Public Buildings Service said that the report overstated the number of 
vacant and underutilized properties in GSA's inventory. He said that 
the 236 GSA properties cited in the report include 43 properties 
representing about 8 million square feet of space that are already 
committed to being used and 37 small, unoccupiable support properties, 
such as pump houses, that are necessary to the functioning of 
occupiable space. We did not change the total number of GSA's 
properties as GSA suggested because the 236 properties met our criteria 
of being vacant or underutilized as of October 1, 2002. Furthermore, 
most of the 43 committed properties remain vacant or underutilized, and 
most of the 37 support properties have vacant or underutilized rentable 
square feet. However, we reflected GSA's concern in the report and 
modified appendix II--the list of GSA's vacant and underutilized 
properties as of October 1, 2002--to specifically identify those 
properties that GSA said were committed to being used and small 
properties that support occupiable space. VA's Assistant Secretary for 
Management and USPS's Managers of Facilities Program Management and 
Realty Asset Management generally agreed with the information in the 
report and provided technical comments that were incorporated in the 
report where appropriate.

Background:

The federal real property environment has many stakeholders and 
involves a vast and diverse portfolio of assets that are used for a 
wide variety of missions. Real property is generally defined as 
facilities; land; and anything constructed on, growing on, or attached 
to land. The U.S. government's fiscal year 2002 financial statements 
show an acquisition cost of more than $335 billion for real property 
assets held by the federal government on September 30, 2002.[Footnote 
6] In terms of facilities, GSA data indicated that as of September 30, 
2000, the federal government owned about 3 billion square feet of 
building floor space worldwide and that GSA, VA, and USPS are the 
largest nondefense holders of this federally owned space. GSA provides 
real estate services for itself as well as for other federal agencies 
and owns such facilities as office buildings, courthouses, and border 
stations.[Footnote 7] VA provides health care services to veterans and 
owns such facilities as hospitals, medical centers, research 
laboratories, and nursing homes and structures that support these 
facilities, such as garages and storage buildings.[Footnote 8] USPS 
provides mail delivery services and owns such facilities as post 
offices and mail processing plants. Also, the three agencies own tracts 
of land that may have been acquired for various purposes. For example, 
in some cases, USPS acquires land adjacent to a postal facility in 
anticipation of a possible need for future expansion of the facility.

Federal real property managers operate in a complex and dynamic 
environment. Numerous laws and regulations govern the acquisition, 
management, and disposal of federal real property. The Federal Property 
and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended (Property Act), and 
the Public Buildings Act of 1959, as amended, are the laws that 
generally apply to the acquisition, use, and disposal of real property 
held by federal agencies.[Footnote 9] GSA is responsible for 
implementing the Property Act and the Public Buildings Act. Agencies, 
including GSA and VA, are subject to the requirements of these acts 
unless they are specifically exempted from them. USPS, which is an 
independent establishment in the executive branch, is exempt from the 
Property Act and from most federal laws dealing with real property and 
contracting. USPS is authorized to sell, lease, or dispose of real 
property under its general powers.[Footnote 10]

In addition to the Property Act, Executive Order 12512, dated April 29, 
1985, required GSA to, among other things, provide governmentwide 
policy oversight and guidance for federal real property management. In 
response to Executive Order 12512, GSA published regulations that 
established governmentwide guidelines that agencies can use to identify 
vacant and underutilized real property.[Footnote 11] Among other 
things, these guidelines provided general definitions of vacant and 
underutilized real properties and established a process that agencies 
can use to review real property holdings and determine the actions that 
may be needed to better use or dispose of vacant and underutilized 
properties.

How GSA, VA, and USPS Identify Vacant and Underutilized Real Property:

GSA, VA, and USPS rely primarily on their real property officials in 
field office locations to identify vacant and underutilized properties. 
According to agency officials and current agency policies and 
procedures, field office officials identify such properties through the 
daily management and oversight of their real property portfolios. Some 
specific steps for identifying vacant and underutilized properties 
include observations that these officials make during on-site property 
visits, communications the officials have with tenant agencies about 
lease renewals, and examinations of agency program requirements that 
will affect agencies' real property needs. In addition, each agency has 
initiated a special nationwide effort to identify unneeded properties 
and develop an effective strategy for better aligning its real property 
assets with each agency's changing mission.

In examining their real property portfolios, GSA and VA officials told 
us that they generally rely on GSA's governmentwide regulations 
concerning vacant and underutilized property as their guide for 
identifying such properties. USPS officials told us that although USPS 
is exempt from these regulations, they continuously strive to identify 
any real property assets that are vacant or underutilized as part of 
their ongoing real property oversight and management responsibilities. 
The regulations, among other things, include various questions that 
agencies could consider in examining their real property portfolios. 
For example, the questions involve such matters as whether contemplated 
agency program changes will alter property requirements or whether all 
of the property is essential for program requirements. GSA officials 
said that each agency has unique properties that serve different 
missions and has significant discretion in interpreting these 
regulations as to when and how best to identify vacant and 
underutilized properties. GSA officials also said that although there 
are no governmentwide data on vacant and underutilized properties, each 
agency is responsible for maintaining its own information on such 
properties.

Identifying Vacant and Underutilized Properties Is a Decentralized 
Process:

GSA headquarters officials are primarily responsible for monitoring the 
use of space in all of its properties to ensure that such space is 
efficiently used. GSA headquarters officials also work with field 
officials to develop plans for enhancing the use of space in vacant and 
underutilized properties or disposing of them. However, identifying 
vacant and underutilized properties in GSA is largely a decentralized 
process and considered an integral part of the routine real property 
management activities that GSA headquarters expects its field officials 
to implement. Asset management teams in GSA's 11 regional offices are 
primarily responsible for real property management activities, which 
include identifying vacant and underutilized properties. The members of 
GSA's regional office asset management teams include various real 
property management officials, such as portfolio directors, asset 
managers, realty specialists, and property managers, who are usually 
located at or near specific properties. According to GSA officials, 
these team members work together on a regular basis to manage the real 
properties for which they are responsible to ensure that the properties 
are well maintained and that property occupants are provided with space 
that will adequately meet their needs. Team members also work together 
to manage the property so that, to the extent possible, the property's 
income, usually received from property tenants, covers or exceeds the 
property's expenses. GSA officials said that asset management team 
members generally identify vacant and underutilized properties while 
carrying out their day-to-day real property management 
responsibilities. For example, a realty specialist, who is responsible 
for monitoring tenant leases in a facility, will apprise other asset 
management team members of any tenants who do not plan to renew their 
leases, which may cause the facility to become vacant or underutilized. 
Also, other means may be used to identify vacant and underutilized 
properties. For example, an asset manager may periodically visit a 
property to make first-hand observations about the overall condition of 
the property and the extent to which space in the property is occupied. 
These asset managers also examine program requirements and changing 
agency mission needs to determine if existing space is adequate.

Like GSA, VA's process for identifying vacant and underutilized 
properties is decentralized. VA headquarters relies primarily on field 
staff to continuously oversee and manage its real properties, which 
involves identifying vacant and underutilized properties. In each of 
VA's 21 regional offices, referred to as Veterans Integrated Service 
Networks (VISN), the VISN director is the key individual responsible 
for overall real property management activities at VA locations. To 
identify vacant and underutilized properties, the VISN director relies 
on various VA personnel, such as chief facility engineers, who are 
usually located at or near the properties and are most knowledgeable 
about them. According to VA officials, these individuals generally work 
together with occupants of the VA property, including medical center 
directors, hospital administrators, and chiefs of medical departments, 
to ensure that the property is well maintained and meets their needs 
for providing veterans with quality health care services. At VA 
locations, vacant and underutilized properties are identified through 
various methods. For example, a chief facility engineer may 
periodically walk through a VA property to identify unoccupied space or 
solicit information from property occupants about the extent to which 
space in the property is being used. Also, some VA locations have 
strategic planning committees that, among other things, are responsible 
for ensuring that space in VA properties is well used and effectively 
responds to changing mission needs. Members of these committees, most 
of which include the associate medical center director and the chief 
facility engineer as well as medical staff representatives such as the 
medical center's chief of surgery, work together on a regular basis to 
review the utilization of space in VA properties and identify specific 
properties or portions of properties that may be vacant or 
underutilized.

Similar to GSA and VA, USPS has a decentralized process in which USPS 
headquarters expects its field staff to be responsible for continuous 
oversight and management of real properties, which includes identifying 
vacant or underutilized properties. USPS officials told us that 
although USPS is not subject to GSA's governmentwide guidelines related 
to such properties, field staff continuously strive to identify vacant 
and underutilized properties as part of their day-to-day real property 
oversight and management responsibilities. The vice presidents in 
charge of USPS's 8 area offices and the Capital Metro office have 
overall responsibility for real property operations in 85 district 
offices throughout the country. District managers, who are in charge of 
district offices and report to area office vice presidents, are 
responsible for the oversight and management of real properties within 
their jurisdictions. District managers are usually located at or near 
USPS properties and rely on various staff, including facility 
engineers, facility specialists, and architect-engineers, for day-to-
day oversight and management of real properties, which includes 
identifying properties or portions of properties that are vacant or 
underutilized. According to USPS officials, USPS field staff may use 
various methods to identify these types of properties, such as periodic 
site visits to observe how space in properties is used and annual real 
property reviews to identify future space needs. Also, USPS field staff 
may receive information from occupants about space utilization changes. 
For example, a postmaster in charge of a post office may notify a 
facility specialist in the district office that changes to mail 
delivery routes have reduced the post office's workload, thus creating 
some vacant space in the post office that may no longer be needed.

GSA, VA, and USPS Have Begun Nationwide Initiatives to Realign Their 
Real Property Portfolios:

All three agencies have recognized the importance of realigning their 
real property portfolios by identifying and disposing of unneeded real 
property. Recently, each agency has initiated a special nationwide 
effort to identify unneeded properties and develop a strategy for 
better aligning its real property assets with each agency's changing 
mission. GSA has recognized that it has many buildings in its 
portfolio, including vacant and underutilized properties that are not 
financially self-sustaining--not generating sufficient income to cover 
expenses--or for which there is not a substantial, long-term federal 
purpose or predominant federal need. In June 2001, GSA initiated an 
overall effort--commonly referred to as the portfolio restructuring 
initiative--to restructure and reinvest in the portfolio. The objective 
of this initiative is to better align GSA's properties with its mission 
of providing quality space and services at a cost that is competitive 
with the private sector. According to GSA officials, GSA is currently 
developing plans for enhancing the utilization of its buildings or 
disposing of them. GSA plans to complete implementation of the 
portfolio restructuring initiative by 2007 and expects by that time to 
have a portfolio of strong, income-producing properties that is much 
more responsive to changing agency mission needs.

In August 1999, we reported that VA could enhance veterans' health care 
benefits if it reduced the level of resources spent on underused or 
inefficient buildings and used these resources instead to provide 
health care more efficiently in existing locations or closer to where 
veterans live.[Footnote 12] We recommended that VA develop asset-
restructuring plans for all of its health care delivery markets to, 
among other things, help guide future decision-making about capital 
real property investments. In responding to this recommendation, VA 
recognized the need to strategically realign its real property assets 
to better serve veterans' health needs and began a process in October 
2000 known as the Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services 
(CARES). VA initiated the CARES process to, among other things, reduce 
its large inventory of vacant and underutilized buildings and the 
significant costs required to maintain them. Many of the buildings 
became vacant and underutilized when VA began shifting its role in the 
mid-1990s from being a traditional hospital-based provider of medical 
services to an integrated delivery system that emphasizes a full 
continuum of care with a significant shift from inpatient to outpatient 
services. To get a better perspective on the extent to which vacant and 
underutilized properties existed nationwide, VA headquarters developed 
a database that identified these properties and that was used in the 
CARES process to identify space conditions in these properties. Through 
CARES, VA expects to develop a nationwide strategic plan that 
identifies the capital real property assets needed to meet veterans' 
health care needs as well as those assets that are no longer needed.

In August 2002, VA announced the results of its CARES pilot test--a 
plan to realign capital real property assets in its Great Lakes 
network, which involves restructuring inpatient facilities and opening 
new outpatient clinics in community settings to provide health care to 
veterans. As part of this plan, VA identified 31 buildings that are no 
longer needed to meet veterans' health care needs, including 30 that 
were vacant, and has developed or implemented alternative use or 
disposal plans for most of these buildings.[Footnote 13] Currently, VA 
is conducting CARES studies in its 20 other health care networks. VA's 
goal is to make property realignment decisions by the end of 2003; at 
that time, given its extensive inventory of buildings nationwide, VA 
expects that many additional buildings will have been identified as not 
needed for use in providing health care to veterans.

VA officials told us that in addition to CARES, VA has initiated other 
actions to address vacant and underutilized real properties. For 
example, under its enhanced-use leasing program, VA has entered into 
various public-private partnerships to help improve the use of some of 
its vacant and underutilized facilities.[Footnote 14] Also, in July 
2001, VA established the Office of Asset Enterprise Management, which 
provides oversight of VA's real property assets by evaluating the 
effectiveness of the implementation of real property asset management 
policies, principles, standards, and guidelines that govern the 
acquisition, management, and disposal of such assets. In addition, VA 
officials said that VA (1) has established 7 capital portfolio goals 
that are designed to help VA better manage its real property assets--3 
of these goals focus on reducing the amount of vacant and underutilized 
space in its facilities; and (2) is developing a portfolio management 
information system known as the Capital Asset Management System that 
will enable VA to measure performance and monitor progress in attaining 
these goals.

USPS has also recognized the need for addressing problems associated 
with vacant and underutilized properties. Faced with such challenges as 
changing customer needs, declining mail volumes, rising costs, and 
increasing security concerns, USPS issued a transformation plan in 
April 2002. In the plan, USPS discussed the need for a comprehensive 
transformation of USPS to ensure that it will be financially viable and 
can adequately fulfill its mission of providing the nation with postal 
services in the 21ST century. USPS also discussed the need to review 
and modify its infrastructure of postal facilities so that it can 
enhance customer service and control costs. Among other things, USPS 
identified various actions it plans to take regarding the process for 
closing and consolidating unneeded postal facilities. For example, USPS 
stated that it will lift the self-imposed moratorium on post office 
closings and consolidations. In addition, USPS plans to work with the 
Postal Rate Commission to streamline the post office closing process to 
minimize the amount of time it takes to reach decisions about post 
office closures. According to USPS officials, USPS will be continuously 
reviewing its entire postal infrastructure to, among other things, 
develop plans for realigning postal facilities to ensure that the 
facilities will adequately fulfill USPS's mission needs. The officials 
told us that as these reviews are completed, USPS will publicly 
announce its plans for realigning postal facilities.

Numbers, Types, and Locations of GSA, VA, and USPS Vacant and 
Underutilized Real Properties:

As of October 1, 2002, GSA, VA, and USPS reported having a total of 927 
vacant and underutilized real properties--including a wide range of 
facilities and land--located throughout the 50 states and in the 
District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.[Footnote 15] Of the 3 agencies, 
VA reported having the highest number of vacant and underutilized real 
properties--a total of 577 properties. GSA was second with 236 vacant 
and underutilized properties; and USPS was third with 114 vacant and 
underutilized properties.[Footnote 16] Table 1 shows a breakdown of the 
total numbers of vacant and underutilized facilities and land at the 3

In commenting on a draft of this report, the Commissioner of GSA's 
Public Buildings Service said that the report overstated the number of 
vacant and underutilized properties in GSA's inventory. He said that 
the 236 GSA properties cited in the report include 43 properties 
representing about 8 million square feet of space that are already 
committed to being used and 37 small, unoccupiable support properties, 
such as pump houses, that are necessary to the functioning of 
occupiable space. We did not change the total number of GSA's 
properties as GSA suggested because the 236 properties met our criteria 
of being vacant or underutilized as of October 1, 2002. Furthermore, 
most of the 43 committed properties remain vacant or underutilized, and 
most of the 37 support properties have vacant or underutilized rentable 
square feet. However, to reflect GSA's concern, we modified appendix 
II--the list of GSA's vacant and underutilized properties as of October 
1, 2002--to specifically identify those properties that GSA said were 
committed to being used and small properties that support occupiable 
space.

GSA, VA, and USPS data showed that of the 927 properties, 600, or about 
65 percent, were vacant properties; and 327, or about 35 percent, were 
underutilized properties. As shown in figure 2, VA and USPS reported 
having more vacant than underutilized properties, whereas GSA reported 
having more underutilized than vacant properties.

[A] The two agencies that identified land properties--VA and USPS--
considered these properties to be vacant.

[End of table]

As table 2 shows, most of the vacant and underutilized properties were 
facilities--807 of 927 properties, or about 87 percent--and these 
facilities included a wide range of structures. Most of GSA's vacant 
and underutilized facilities included office buildings, warehouses, and 
storage facilities. VA's vacant and underutilized facilities were 
buildings that were generally located on medical complexes in campus-
like settings. These facilities typically included various medical 
buildings, such as hospitals, medical centers, and nursing homes along 
with structures that supported the medical buildings, such as garages 
and storage buildings. Most of USPS's facilities included post offices, 
stations, and branches. The 807 facilities represented a total of about 
32.1 million square feet of space.[Footnote 17] Although VA reported 
having the highest number of facilities, GSA's facilities had the 
highest amount of square footage. Specifically, GSA reported that its 
facilities had about 18.4 million square feet,[Footnote 18] or 57 
percent of the total square footage belonging to the 3 agencies; VA 
reported that its facilities had about 9.4 million square feet, or 29 
percent, of the total square footage; and USPS reported that its 
facilities had about 4.3 million square feet, or 13 percent, of the 
total square footage.[Footnote 19]

In addition, the sizes of the facilities ranged from less than 10,000 
square feet to over 100,000 square feet, with about half of the 
facilities under 10,000 square feet. Of the 63 properties that were 
over 100,000 square feet, 6 were over 500,000 square feet, with 1 of 
the 6 facilities having about 2.5 million square feet of space. Table 3 
shows the ranges of facility sizes.

USPS--as of October 1, 2002:

It should be noted that the three agencies have taken actions or have 
planned actions to improve the use of some of these facilities or 
dispose of them. For example, through its portfolio restructuring 
initiative, GSA has developed plans to do repair and alteration work at 
46 buildings and use the space in these buildings to house other 
federal agencies. In addition, GSA anticipates that 44 other buildings 
will ultimately be candidates for disposal. By the end of 2003, VA 
expects that its CARES process will result in a nationwide strategic 
plan that, among other things, will not only help VA improve the use of 
space in its facilities but also identify those real property assets 
that are no longer needed. Also, USPS has ongoing efforts to sell 
unneeded properties. For example, during 2002, USPS generated a total 
of $25.5 million in revenue from the sales of unneeded properties, 
which was an increase over similar sales in 2001 that totaled $22.7 
million.

Of the three agencies, only VA and USPS reported having vacant land. As 
of October 1, 2002, VA and USPS identified a total of 120 tracts of 
vacant land, which amounted to a total of about 2,000 acres. The land 
tracts ranged in size from less than 1 acre to 174 acres. As shown in 
table 4, 80, or about 67 percent, of the tracts of land owned by VA and 
USPS fell into the category of less than 1 acre to 10 acres. Only 9 
properties fell into the category of more than 50 acres, with VA having 
most of these properties.

As previously mentioned, our analysis of GSA, VA, and USPS data showed 
that the 927 vacant or underutilized properties were located throughout 
the 50 states and in the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. GSA's 
vacant and underutilized properties were located in 42 states and the 
District of Columbia, and VA's vacant and underutilized properties were 
located in 47 states and the District of Columbia. USPS's vacant and 
underutilized properties were located in 33 states and Puerto Rico. 
These 927 vacant and underutilized properties were located in 294 
cities in the United States and Puerto Rico. Some of these vacant and 
underutilized properties were located in large metropolitan cities, 
such as Los Angeles, California; Chicago, Illinois; and Dallas, Texas; 
others were in smaller cities, such as Newington, Connecticut; Marion, 
Indiana; and Canton, Ohio. The data also showed that 49 locations had 5 
or more of these properties. The highest numbers of vacant and 
underutilized properties were reported for Los Angeles, California, 
which had a total of 54 properties; and Fort Howard, Maryland, which 
had a total of 43 properties. A list of GSA's vacant and underutilized 
real properties is included in appendix II. Lists of vacant and 
underutilized real properties for VA and USPS are included in 
appendixes III and IV, respectively. Appendix V identifies the 49 
locations that had 5 or more vacant and underutilized properties.

GSA, VA, and USPS officials explained that each vacant or underutilized 
property has a unique history that, among other things, involves how 
long the property has been vacant or underutilized and the reasons why 
the property became vacant or underutilized. The officials told us that 
real property staff in field locations who have direct responsibility 
for oversight and management of vacant and underutilized properties 
would be in the best position to provide detailed information on the 
history of these properties. The officials explained that in all 
likelihood, changing agency mission needs along with other problems, 
such as the advanced age of various vacant and underutilized properties 
and their deteriorated condition, were the most common factors that led 
to the properties becoming vacant or underutilized.

GSA, VA, and USPS officials said that although some vacant and 
underutilized federal properties have potential for alternate uses, the 
properties have for various reasons remained vacant or underutilized 
for years. For example, as discussed in our July 2001 report on public-
private partnerships, the GSA-held property that is shown in figure 3-
-the L. Mendel Rivers federal office building in Charleston, South 
Carolina--has been vacant for about 4 years.[Footnote 20] According to 
GSA officials, this facility--a 7-story, 100,000-square-foot building 
on just over 2 acres--has no rentable square footage. The facility is 
contaminated with asbestos and has been unoccupied since it sustained 
damage in 1999 from Hurricane Floyd. We reported that although there 
was a weak federal demand for space where the property is located, the 
property is located in a highly desirable location where land values 
are high, and there was a strong potential for private sector demand. 
GSA officials estimated that in fiscal year 2002, a total of about 
$28,000 was spent to cover various building operations and maintenance 
expenses, such as fire protection and utilities. A GSA official told us 
that as of April 2003, GSA and the city of Charleston had developed a 
memorandum of understanding, which states that the city of Charleston 
will construct a new building for GSA and, in exchange, the city will 
take control of the L. Mendel Rivers building. The official estimated 
that the city should be able to proceed with the new GSA building 
project in the summer of 2003.

Federal Building in Charleston, South Carolina:

Another example of a long-held vacant property involves a VA-owned 
building at a health care facility campus in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. This 
134,000-square-foot building, which is shown in figure 4, has been 
vacant for about 14 years. The building had been used as the campus' 
main hospital but was vacated in 1989 primarily because a new main 
hospital was built on the campus. VA officials told us that in June 
1999, a consulting firm--Economic Research Associates--issued a study 
in which it identified various options for VA to consider in trying to 
enhance the use of various vacant and underutilized buildings on the 
Milwaukee campus, including the former main hospital building.[Footnote 
21] On the basis of the study's results, VA officials told us that a 
substantial investment of capital would in all likelihood be needed to 
convert this building for alternate use. For example, to convert the 
building for use as housing for the elderly, the study estimated that 
about $8.4 million to $9.3 million would be needed. VA officials also 
mentioned that various organizations, such as the Salvation Army and 
the Knights of Columbus, expressed some interest in leasing the 
building; but thus far, VA has not received any firm offers from these 
organizations. VA officials told us that in fiscal year 2001, VA 
incurred about $348,000 in maintenance costs for this building, which 
included such expenses as utilities, pest management, and security. 
Also, the officials said that VA currently has no alternate use or 
disposal plans for this building.

Building on the Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Health Facility Campus:

An example of a vacant USPS facility is the former Chicago Main Post 
Office located in downtown Chicago, Illinois, which is shown in figure 
5. This 2.5-million-square-foot former post office and mail processing 
facility has not been used as the main post office since 1997--about 6 
years--when it was replaced with a new postal facility. According to 
USPS officials, annual holding costs for this property exceed $2 
million. The officials also told us that although USPS has received 
various offers to purchase this facility, attempts to complete the sale 
have thus far been delayed due mainly to (1) an overall weakness in the 
Chicago real estate market, which has raised concerns about whether a 
sufficient number of tenants could be found to occupy the facility; and 
(2) the inability of potential developers and the city of Chicago to 
agree on real estate tax abatement issues. According to USPS, there 
will have to be a breakthrough in current market conditions, together 
with an agreement between potential developers and the city of Chicago, 
before this project can move forward.

Vacant and Underutilized Properties Pose Challenges for Federal 
Agencies:

As noted in the above examples, the efficient use or disposal of 
unneeded real property, including vacant and underutilized property, 
poses significant challenges for federal agencies.[Footnote 22] As 
discussed in our January 2003 high-risk report on federal real 
property, disposal of unneeded real property is a complicated issue 
influenced by various laws as well as budgetary limitations.[Footnote 
23] The high-risk report pointed out that in the disposal area, a range 
of laws intended to address other objectives challenges agencies' 
efforts to dispose of unneeded property. For example, USPS is 
specifically precluded from closing small post offices solely for 
economic reasons.[Footnote 24] Furthermore, agencies are required under 
the National Environmental Policy Act to consider the environmental 
impact of their decisions to dispose of real property. Generally 
speaking, agencies are responsible for environmental cleanup of any 
hazardous substances associated with the properties prior to disposal, 
such as medical wastes, asbestos, and lead paint. Despite the 
importance of this, cleanup costs can be considerable and can involve 
years of study. For property with historic designations--which is 
common in the federal portfolio--agencies are required by the National 
Historic Preservation Act to ensure that historic preservation is 
factored into how the property is eventually used.

The high-risk report also pointed out that most agencies cannot retain 
the proceeds from the sale of unneeded property. Given that agencies 
are required to fund the costs of preparing property for disposal, the 
inability to retain any of the proceeds acts as an additional 
disincentive. The report further pointed out that public-private 
partnership arrangements can be a viable option for redeveloping 
obsolete federal property when they provide the best economic value for 
the government, compared with other options, such as federal financing 
through appropriations or sale of the property. However, most agencies 
are precluded from entering into such arrangements. The high-risk 
report recommended the development of a comprehensive and integrated 
real property transformation strategy that, among other things, could 
identify how best to realign and rationalize federal real property and 
dispose of unneeded real property assets.

Continuing to hold unneeded vacant and underutilized properties is 
costly to the government and can present an image of waste and 
inefficiency that erodes taxpayer confidence. Given this, we plan to 
continue monitoring federal agencies' efforts to realign their real 
property portfolios. These efforts can help the agencies respond to 
changing mission needs and reduce the large number of vacant and 
underutilized properties in their real property inventories.

Agency Comments and Our Evaluation:

We received written comments on a draft of this report from GSA's 
Commissioner of the Public Buildings Service on June 23, 2003 (see app. 
VI). He said that the report overstates the amount of underutilized 
space in GSA's inventory. He said that the current list of GSA 
properties in the report includes vacant space that was not available 
for assignment because it is already committed, such as space being 
renovated for a customer agency. He stated that revising our list of 
vacant and underutilized properties to recognize properties committed 
to being occupied would reduce the total number of properties by 43--
from 236 to 193--and the square footage from 18.2 million to 10.3 
million. In addition, he said that the number of vacant and 
underutilized properties is inflated by the inclusion of 37 small 
support properties that were unoccupiable, such as a pump house or a 
parking lot booth, but necessary to the functioning of occupiable 
space. The Commissioner went on to say that support properties are 
small and have little impact on the square footage of underutilized 
space reported, but the inclusion of these properties does 
disproportionately affect the number of underutilized properties. He 
stated that as of March 2003, the vacant assignable space in GSA's 
owned inventory, which he said was the commonly accepted private sector 
measure of vacancy, was 10 million square feet, which was only 5.5 
percent of GSA's owned inventory. He also said that this percent is 
well below industry averages. He went on to say that as GSA implements 
its portfolio restructuring initiative, which is discussed earlier in 
this report, it will further improve the performance of its real 
property portfolio. For example, phasing out GSA's warehouses will 
reduce the current list of vacant and underutilized properties by 48 
buildings.

We did not change the total number of GSA's vacant and underutilized 
properties in the report. One of our objectives was to identify all 
vacant and underutilized properties in GSA's inventory as of October 1, 
2002, so that we could provide an overview of these types of properties 
at a given point in time. According to GSA data, the 43 properties, 
which GSA said were committed to future use, and the 37 properties, 
which GSA said were support properties, met our criteria as vacant or 
underutilized properties as of October 1, 2002. Furthermore, based on 
updated information that we obtained from GSA, 37 of the 43 properties 
that GSA said were committed to future use remained vacant or 
underutilized as of May 1, 2003. In addition, 30 of the 37 support 
properties that GSA cites as unoccupiable had rentable space that GSA 
reported as vacant or underutilized.

In the report, we provided specific information on the types, sizes, 
and vacancy rates for all properties reported by GSA, including 
committed and support properties, which provides transparency and 
context for understanding the nature of these properties. In addition, 
we stated in the report that the identification and disposal of vacant 
and underutilized property is an ongoing process, with the numbers of 
properties thus subject to constant change. Also, we recognized in the 
report that GSA (1) has developed plans to do repair and alteration 
work at 46 buildings and use the space in these buildings to house 
other federal agencies and (2) anticipates that 44 other buildings will 
ultimately be candidates for disposal. However, we reflected GSA's 
concern in the report and modified appendix II--the list of all GSA 
vacant and underutilized properties as of October 1, 2002--to 
specifically identify those properties that GSA identified as committed 
to being used and as support facilities necessary to the functioning of 
occupiable space. We did not verify the data that GSA provided on 
committed space and support properties.

We applaud GSA's efforts to restructure its real property portfolio and 
its current progress in reducing vacant assignable space. GSA's current 
portfolio restructuring initiative, if implemented effectively, can go 
a long way toward better aligning GSA's properties to provide quality 
space and services at a cost that is competitive with the private 
sector and to reduce the number of vacant and underutilized properties 
in its real property inventory. GSA also provided technical comments 
that were incorporated in the report where appropriate.

On June 23, 2003, we received oral comments from VA's Assistant 
Secretary for Management and USPS's Managers of Facilities Program 
Management and Realty Asset Management. They generally agreed with the 
information in the report and provided technical comments that were 
incorporated in the report where appropriate.

We will send copies of the report to the appropriate congressional 
committees, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the 
Administrator of GSA, the Secretary of the Department of Veterans 
Affairs, and the Postmaster General. Copies will also be made available 
to other interested parties on request. In addition, the report will be 
available at no charge on our Web site at www.gao.gov.

Appendixes: 

Appendix I: Objectives, Scope, and Methodology:

To meet the first objective, which was to provide information on how 
the General Services Administration (GSA), Department of Veterans 
Affairs (VA), and U.S. Postal Service (USPS) identified vacant and 
underutilized real properties, we reviewed, analyzed, and discussed 
with GSA and VA officials governmentwide real property management laws, 
regulations, and executive orders, which established criteria for most 
federal agencies to follow in accomplishing their responsibilities 
regarding vacant and underutilized real property. Also, because USPS is 
exempt from most federal laws dealing with real property, we reviewed 
appropriate legislation that authorizes USPS to sell, lease, or dispose 
of property under its general powers and discussed this legislation 
with USPS headquarters officials responsible for real property 
management operations. In addition, we reviewed various internal GSA, 
VA, and USPS documents, such as manuals, handbooks, and bulletins, 
which provided guidance on the agencies' procedures for identifying 
vacant and underutilized real property under their control. We also 
discussed these procedures with various headquarters and field 
officials from GSA, VA, and USPS who were responsible for and most 
knowledgeable about their agencies' real property management operations 
involving vacant and underutilized property. 

To meet the second objective, which was to provide information on the 
numbers, types, and locations of vacant and underutilized real 
properties at the three agencies, we obtained data from agency 
headquarters officials at GSA, VA's Veterans Health Administration, and 
USPS on their owned vacant and underutilized real properties--
facilities and land--as of October 1, 2002. In addition to identifying 
the numbers, types, and locations of such properties, we also examined, 
analyzed, and formatted the data to obtain some perspective and context 
about the characteristics of the properties, including size and vacancy 
rate. GSA suggested using a property's vacancy rate as the basis for 
determining whether a facility could be considered vacant or 
underutilized. GSA officials told us that they considered a facility as 
underutilized if it had a vacancy rate of 26 percent or more. 

To establish a clearer distinction between vacant and underutilized 
facilities in this report, we considered a facility with a 100 percent 
vacancy rate to be vacant and a facility with a vacancy rate of 26 
percent to 99 percent to be underutilized. Using vacancy rates that 
GSA, VA, and USPS provided to us, we categorized the three agencies' 
facilities as either vacant or underutilized. For the purposes of this 
report, all land properties were considered 100 percent vacant. 

The real property data provided by GSA, VA, and USPS were the only 
centralized data available that could provide some indication of the 
numbers, types, and locations of the three agencies' vacant and 
underutilized properties nationwide. We did some limited testing of the 
real property data by discussing with agencies' headquarters database 
managers any apparent inconsistencies or inaccuracies we found with the 
data. On the basis of those discussions, we adjusted the data to ensure 
that the inconsistencies and inaccuracies we found were corrected or 
clearly explained. We did not perform a detailed review of the three 
agencies' computer systems that generated these data to determine the 
extent to which significant errors or incompleteness in the key real 
property data elements might exist. Also, we did not consider in our 
analysis the appropriateness of how space was used in the agencies' 
real properties. In addition, we did not examine the extent to which 
agencies used GSA's governmentwide guidelines to identify vacant and 
underutilized properties. As part of the initial request, we were also 
asked to develop information on the impact that GSA, VA, and USPS 
vacant and underutilized properties had on their real property 
operations and the local communities where the properties are located. 
As agreed with congressional staff, it was decided that this issue 
would be best pursued under a separate engagement. 

We received written comments on a draft of this report from the 
Commissioner of GSA's Public Buildings Service and oral comments from 
VA's Assistant Secretary for Management and USPS's Managers of 
Facilities Program Management and Realty Asset Management. The comments 
we received are discussed near the end of the letter, and GSA's written 
comments are included in appendix VI. We performed our work from 
November 2002 through June 2003 in accordance with generally accepted 
governmentwide auditing standards.

[A] Some GSA properties are installations that include more than one 
structure. For such structures, GSA's database provided only the 
address for the installation. Thus, in some cases, more than one 
structure will have the same address.

[B] Building size is in rentable square feet. Some buildings, such as 
those scheduled for demolition, have no rentable square feet. 

[C] This table includes all GSA buildings that had a vacancy rate of 
26 percent or higher.

[D] GSA officials told us that as of May 1, 2003, GSA was considering 
alternatives or implementing actions aimed at enhancing the 
utilization of this property or disposing of it.

[E] GSA officials told us that as of May 1, 2003, this property was no 
longer vacant or underutilized because scheduled renovations for the 
property had been completed, and the property had a vacancy rate of 25 
percent or less. 

[F] According to GSA officials, this property is a support structure 
necessary to the functioning of occupiable space.

[G] According to GSA officials, this property includes vacant space 
that is committed for use. For example, in some cases, such space is 
being renovated for a customer agency.

[H] GSA officials told us that as of May 1, 2003, GSA had initiated 
actions to dispose of this property. 

[I] GSA did not have vacancy rates for some buildings but had a 
vacancy rate for the entire installation on which the building was 
located. This vacancy rate is the installation vacancy rate.

[A] Some VA properties are medical complexes that include multiple 
structures and land. For such properties, VA's database provided only 
the address for the medical complex. Thus, in some cases, multiple 
structures and land will have the same address.

[B] This table provides information that describes various types of VA 
structures, such as hospitals and storage facilities, when such 
information was available from VA's database. When descriptive 
information on structure types was not available, the structure was 
designated as a VA building. Also, the vacant tracts of land that VA 
reported were generally located on medical complexes. VA officials 
told us that these land tracts, which had no structures on them, may 
be suitable for development. However, the officials said that a final 
determination has not been made on whether these land tracts can be 
made available for disposal. 

[C] This table includes all VA structures that had a vacancy rate of 
26 percent or higher.

[D] In past years, VA provided housing for some employees, such as the 
hospital director, assistant director, and director of finance.

[E] VA officials told us that updated information on the planned 
disposition of these vacant and underutilized properties would in all 
likelihood be available after the Secretary of Veterans Affairs 
approved the results of the Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced 
Services process. The officials anticipated that this approval would 
occur by the end of 2003.

Appendix VI: Comments from the General Services Administration:

GSA Public Buildings Service:

JUN 23 2003:

Mark L. Goldstein:

Acting Director, Physical Infrastructure Issues 

U.S. General Accounting Office:

Washington, DC 20548:

Dear Mr. Goldstein:

We appreciate the opportunity to comment on the U.S. General Accounting 
Office draft report entitled Federal Real Property: Vacant and 
Underutilized Properties at GSA, VA, and USPS" (GAO-03-747).

In addition to providing editorial suggestions (Enclosure 1), we have 
one fundamental comment: you have overstated the amount of 
underutilized space in GSA's inventory by including vacant space that 
is not available for assignment because it is already committed; for 
example, space that is being renovated for a customer agency. Revising 
your list of vacant and underutilized properties (Enclosure 2) would 
reduce the number of properties from 236 to 193 and the square footage 
from 18.2 to 10.3 million.

We also would like to note that the number of vacant and underutilized 
properties is inflated by the inclusion of 37 support properties. While 
themselves unoccupiable, they are necessary to the functioning of 
occupiable space; for example, a pump house or a parking lot booth. 
These properties are small and have little impact on the square footage 
of underutilized space reported, but their inclusion does 
disproportionately impact the number of underutilized properties (see 
added footnote on Enclosure 2).

I am pleased to report that as of March 2003, the vacant assignable 
space in our owned inventory - the commonly accepted private sector 
measure of vacancy - was 10 million square feet, which is only 5.5 
percent of our owned inventory. This vacancy rate is well below 
industry averages.

As we implement our restructuring initiative, we will improve the 
performance of our owned portfolio by reinvesting in viable assets for 
which there is a long-term federal need and by redeploying non-
performing assets. For example, phasing out our warehouses will reduce 
the forty-eight buildings (5 million square feet) that now appear on 
the list of vacant and underutilized properties.

Thank you for the opportunity to review and comment on the draft 
report. If you have any questions or if we can provide any further 
assistance, please have your staff contact Mr. William H. Matthews, 
Assistant Commissioner for Portfolio Management, on (202) 501-0638.

Sincerely,

F. Joseph Moravec

FOOTNOTES

[1] GSA's Federal Property Management Regulations define not utilized 
property as an entire property or portion of a property that is not 
occupied or used for current program purposes of the accountable agency 
or property that is occupied in caretaker status only. According to a 
GSA official, property that is not utilized is generally considered 
vacant. The regulations also define underutilized property as an entire 
property or portion of a property that is used only at irregular 
periods or intermittently by the accountable agency or property that is 
being used for the agency's current program purposes that can be 
satisfied with only a portion of the property. (41 C.F.R. 101-47.801)

[2] U.S. General Accounting Office, High-Risk Series: Federal Real 
Property, GAO-03-122 (Washington, D.C. Jan. 2003).

[3] Under a public-private partnership, sometimes referred to as a 
public-private venture, the federal government and a private entity 
form an arrangement in which the federal government contributes real 
property and the private entity contributes financial capital and 
borrowing ability to redevelop or renovate real property to serve, in 
part or in whole, a public need.

[4] U.S. General Services Administration, Summary Report of Real 
Property Owned by the United States Throughout the World, (Washington, 
D.C. June 2001). In our report on governmentwide real property data, 
we stated that such data, which are compiled by GSA and often referred 
to as the worldwide inventory, have been unreliable and of limited 
usefulness, and we made recommendations to GSA to improve the data. GSA 
officials stated that they are currently making improvements to the 
data in response to our recommendations. We use these data here because 
at the time of our review, they provided the only available indication 
of the size and characteristics of the federal real property inventory. 
(See U.S. General Accounting Office, Federal Real Property: Better 
Governmentwide Data Needed for Strategic Decisionmaking, GAO-02-342 
[Washington, D.C. Apr. 16, 2002]).

[5] As part of your request, you also wanted to know the impact that 
GSA, VA, and USPS vacant and underutilized properties had on their real 
property operations and the local communities where the properties are 
located. As agreed with congressional staff, it was decided that this 
issue would be best pursued under a separate engagement.

[6] This amount does not include stewardship assets, which are not 
reported on the government's balance sheet. These assets include 
wilderness areas, scenic river systems, monuments, defense facilities 
(including military bases), and national defense assets. Also, real 
property data contained in the financial statements of the U.S. 
government have been problematic mainly because the government lacked 
complete and reliable information on its asset holdings, including real 
property. We were unable to express an opinion on the U.S. government's 
consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2002.

[7] GSA's Public Buildings Service is the major component within GSA 
that provides real property services to federal agencies.

[8] VA's Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is the major component 
within VA that provides health care services to veterans. In this 
report, we focused on VHA properties.

[9] The Property Act is set forth at 40 U.S.C. § 101 et. seq. The 
Property Act excludes certain types of property, such as public domain 
assets and land reserved or dedicated for national forest or national 
park purposes. The Public Buildings Act is set forth at 40 U.S.C. § 
3301 et. seq.

[10] 39 U.S.C. §§ 201 and 401; for purposes of this report, our 
definition of agency includes USPS, an independent establishment in the 
executive branch.

Needed for Management of Excess Real Property, GAO-03-326 (Washington, 
D.C. Jan. 29, 2003).

[14] 38 U.S.C. §8161 (2002) et seq. VA has its own authority to enter 
into partnerships to lease its properties to nongovernmental entities. 
In turn, these entities develop, rehabilitate, or renovate the 
properties.

[15] The identification and disposal of vacant and underutilized 
property is an ongoing process. Given this, the numbers of properties 
are subject to constant change.

[16] The 927 vacant and underutilized properties--including 807 
facilities and 120 tracts of land, which totaled about 2,000 acres--
represented a small portion of the total number of properties held by 
these 3 agencies. Specifically, as of October 1, 2002, the 3 agencies 
owned a total of about 14,900 facilities and 44,900 acres of land, with 
GSA holding about 1,700 facilities and 8,700 acres of land; VA holding 
about 4,900 facilities and 15,600 acres of land; and USPS holding about 
8,300 facilities and 20,600 acres of land.

[17] Our review of the square footage data for these facilities 
revealed that 31 GSA facilities had no rentable square footage. GSA 
officials told us that generally, such facilities could not be rented 
because various structural or environmental conditions made them 
unsuitable for tenant occupation.

[18] In commenting on a draft of this report, GSA's Commissioner of the 
Public Buildings Service said that about 8 million square feet of this 
space was already committed to being occupied.

[19] Percentages do not add to 100 due to rounding.
