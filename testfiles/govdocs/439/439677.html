<p>The NIST Advanced Measurement Laboratory, which houses CNST, is one of the largest and most technologically advanced research facilities in the world. It is able to
provide tight control of
vibration, temperature, humidity, and air cleanliness.   The facility allows NIST to provide the sophisticated measurements and standards
needed by U.S. industry and the scientific community for key 21st century technologies such as nanotechnology, semiconductors, biotechnology,
advanced materials, quantum computing and advanced manufacturing.
<br><br>

The $235 million, 49,843 square meter (536,507 square foot) Advanced Measurement Laboratory features five separate wings,
each with one occupiable scientific level.  Two metrology wings (buildings 218 and 219) are below grade, two physcal sciences wings (buildings
216 and 217) and a Cleanroom wing (building 215) are located above grade.
<br><br>

The AML was designed by HDR Architecture Inc. of Alexandria, Va., and constructed by Clark/Gilford, a joint venture of The Clark Construction Group
Inc. of Bethesda, Md., and Gilford Corporation of Beltsville, Md.
