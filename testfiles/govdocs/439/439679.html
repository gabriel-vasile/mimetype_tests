the government would be prepared to prove at trial that the
defendant "entered a steel storage shed . . . belonging to
[another] with intent to commit larceny in the nighttime."  Bennett
agreed with this statement.  Based on a reading of the statute
under which Bennett was convicted and the record before the court,
the district court found that Bennett was properly classified as an
armed career criminal and sentenced him to 180 months imprisonment.</span></span></p>

&sect; 924(e)(1).  The definition of "violent felony" includes, <span style="text-decoration: underline">inter
alia</span>, the crime of burglary, but the term "burglary" itself is not
defined in the statute.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Id.</span> &sect; 922(e)(2).</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>The Supreme Court, however, addressed the meaning of
burglary as used in the ACCA in <span style="text-decoration: underline">United States</span> v. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Taylor</span>, 495 U.S.
575 (1990).  The Court first rejected both the view that the
definition depends on the label adopted by the state of conviction
and the idea that Congress meant to include only the common-law
definition of burglary as "breaking and entering of a dwelling at
night, with intent to commit a felony."  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Id.</span> at 592.  Rather, the
Court concluded that</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 1in; margin-right: 1in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span style="font-size: 12pt">Congress meant by 'burglary' the generic sense
in which the term is now used in the criminal
codes of most states.  Although the exact
formulations vary, the generic, contemporary
meaning of burglary contains at least the
following elements: an unlawful or
unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a
building or other structure, with intent to
commit a crime.</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 0.416667in">&#160;</p>

of an ACCA sentencing enhancement if it "substantially corresponds
to 'generic' burglary, or the charging paper and jury instructions
actually required the jury to find all the elements of generic
burglary in order to convict the defendant."  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Id.</span> at 602.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>In assessing whether a state conviction qualifies as

"looking only to the statutory definitions of the prior offenses,
and not to the particular facts underlying those convictions."  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Id.</span>
at 600.  When the state statute defines burglary more broadly than
the generic definition, however, the court may then look to whether
the jury was required to find all the elements of generic burglary.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Mastera</span>, 435 F.3d 56, 59 (1st Cir. 2006), but we review the

clear error, <span style="text-decoration: underline">United States</span> v. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Delgado</span>, 288 F.3d 49, 52 (1st Cir.
2002).  We begin our review with the Rhode Island statute under
which Bennett was convicted for the predicate crime at issue,
entitled "Breaking and entering other buildings with criminal
intent - Railroad cars - Tractor trailers."  R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 11-8-5.  The first clause of the statute makes it unlawful to "break and
enter or enter in the nighttime, with intent to commit [a crime] in
it, any barn, stable, carriage house, or other building."  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Id.</span>  The

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Taylor</span> did, including the breaking and entering of more than just
buildings and structures, we look to the record before the court to

</script>
<span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span style="font-size: 12pt">  The
transcript of the plea colloquy clearly shows that Bennett was
convicted under the first clause of the statute, involving the
burglary of "other buildings," and therefore we base our
determination of whether the conviction qualifies as generic
burglary on the elements required for conviction under the "other
buildings" clause.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Bennett contends that to meet the <span style="text-decoration: underline">Taylor</span> definition of
generic burglary, the structure involved in a predicate crime must
be "occupiable," in the sense that it must be large enough to
accommodate a person.  He points to a Ninth Circuit case, <span style="text-decoration: underline">United
States</span> v. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sparks</span>, 265 F.3d 825, 835 (9th Cir. 2001), which found
that the burglary of a storage locker that would not accommodate a
person does not fall within the definition of generic burglary. 
Bennett also asserts that Rhode Island law suggests a requirement
of habitability or occupiable space.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>The types of buildings to which the Rhode Island statute
refers, such as barns, stables, and presumably, steel storage
sheds, clearly fit within <span style="text-decoration: underline">Taylor</span>'s definition of generic burglary;
they are, by the plain language of the statute, "buildings or other
structures."  They clearly do not comprise such items as
automobiles, boats, railroad cars, tents, or vending machines,
which <span style="text-decoration: underline">Taylor</span> rejected as "structures" for purposes of generic
burglary.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Taylor</span> also rejected the idea that state law defines the
contours of burglary under the ACCA, and therefore we decline to
look to Rhode Island law to resolve this question.  Furthermore,
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sparks</span> is inapposite, because the statute at issue plainly concerns
the burglary of "buildings" as opposed to smaller enclosed spaces
such as storage lockers.  Bennett was convicted of "entering" into
a steel storage shed, and therefore we know that the structure was
large enough to be entered by a person.  Thus this case does not
raise any issue about structures not large enough to permit human
entry.</span></span></p>

"unlawful or unprivileged" entry, and the record before the court
did not indicate that his entry was "unlawful or unprivileged." 
Bennett did not raise this issue below and therefore we review for
plain error.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">United States</span> v. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Duarte</span>, 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir.
2001).  We have not addressed the contours of the "unlawful or
unprivileged" element of generic burglary under <span style="text-decoration: underline">Taylor</span>, and there
exists a circuit split on the issue.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Compare</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">United States</span> v.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Bowden</span>, 975 F.2d 1080, 1084-85 (4th Cir. 1992) (finding that "the
entry of a man who enters without breaking with intent to commit a
felony or larceny is neither lawful nor privileged, so it must be
within <span style="text-decoration: underline">Taylor</span>"), <span style="text-decoration: underline">with</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">United States</span> v. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Maness</span>, 23 F.3d 1006, 1008-09 (6th Cir. 1994) (finding that the same statute at issue in
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Bowden</span> "does not satisfy Taylor's definition of generic burglary"
because intent to commit a crime is a "separate and distinct
element[]" from unlawful or unprivileged entry).  In light of
conflicting case law, any error that might have been committed by
the district court was not "obvious," and therefore not plain
error.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">United States</span> v. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Olano</span>, 507 U.S. 725, 734 (1993) ("At a
minimum, court of appeals cannot correct an error pursuant to Rule
52(b) unless the error is clear under current law.").</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Bennett's remaining two claims merit little discussion. 
First, he claims that his Sixth Amendment rights were violated
because the judge, rather than a jury, determined that his
predicate conviction constituted a violent felony.  Bennett
suggests that <span style="text-decoration: underline">United States</span> v. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Booker</span>, 543 U.S. 220 (2005),
requires that the nature of his conviction be determined beyond a
reasonable doubt by a jury.  We very recently rejected the position
that a jury must determine whether a prior conviction is a violent
felony for purposes of a sentencing enhancement; the determination
is a question of law and therefore for the court, not the jury. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">United States</span> v. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Bishop</span>, 453 F.3d 30, 32 (1st Cir. 2006).</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Second, Bennet claims that his Fifth and Sixth Amendment
rights were violated because the Government failed to properly
plead and prove the ACCA enhancements.  He asks us to find that as
a matter of statutory construction, the ACCA requires the
Government to charge his prior convictions in an indictment and
prove them beyond a reasonable doubt.  Bennett concedes that he did
not raise this issue below.  We thus review for plain error, which
requires that the defendant show "(1) that an error occurred (2)
which was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected the
defendant's substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the
fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings." 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Duarte</span>, 246 F.3d at 60.  The district court committed no obvious
error, since the text of the ACCA says nothing about pleading and
proof of predicate convictions.  Furthermore, we recently rejected
in <span style="text-decoration: underline">United States</span> v. <span style="text-decoration: underline">McKenney</span> the constitutional argument that the
Government must charge predicate convictions under the ACCA in an
indictment, reiterating that "[t]he Supreme Court has rejected the
argument that under the Constitution, recidivism must be treated as
an element of the offense, included in the indictment, and proved
to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt."  450 F.3d 39, 45-46 (1st Cir.
2006) (citing <span style="text-decoration: underline">Almendarez-Torres</span> v. <span style="text-decoration: underline">United States</span>, 523 U.S. 224, 239
(1998)).  As a result, the district court did not commit plain
error in failing to apply the doctrine of constitutional avoidance
by reading into the ACCA Bennett's proposed requirement.  There is
no constitutional issue and therefore nothing to avoid.</span></span></p>
