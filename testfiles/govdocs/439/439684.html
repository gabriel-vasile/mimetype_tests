I am writing to ask that you reconsider some of the requirements you are proposing to regulate the direct sales industry.  I am a PartyLite Consultant who has been proud to be involved in this business for 15 -1/2 years.  I began my PartyLite business to get out of debt.  I was laid off from my job of 22 years 10 years ago and now I just to PartyLite.

The proposals you are suggesting would make my business much more dfficult and possibly impact my income.  Specifically, in terms of the references requirement, I would never feel comfortable providing the personal contact information of other people in PartyLite, nor would I want my own personal information given out freely.

I feel good about sharing PartyLite's very real business opportunity with others, and want to continue to easily introduce PartyLite to more people who could benefit as I have.  The regulations you are proposing would hinder me from doing so - and would hinder others in starting their business in the timeframe they choose.  Most people join PartyLite wanting and often needing to earn money right away, and your proposal would make them wait even longer.  In addition, I cannot see myself sharing private information about other PartyLite Consultants and I certainly not want my private information shared without my consent.

Please know that I'm thankful that we have the FTC working to protect average consumers like me, but in this case, you will be working against me, impacting my income, and my future. Since I am single, it is my only income and my future.

Please reconsider the regulations you are proposing.

Respectfully yours,
Jan Piller, Independent Consultant and Leader</body></html>
