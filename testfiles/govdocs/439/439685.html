  December 4, 1987
<ol type="1">
<p><li><u>PURPOSE</u>. To transmit the revised Real Property and Space Management Manual. 
<p><li><u>CANCELLATION</u>. FHWA Order M 4230.2, Real Property and Space Management Manual, dated May 26, 1981, is canceled. 
<p><li><u>EXPLANATION OF CHANGES</u> 
<ol type="a">
  <p><li>In recent years, the General Services Administration (GSA) has placed 
    increased emphasis on the efficient utilization of Federal space holdings. 
    As a result, the GSA has revised its regulations on space utilization to an 
    extent requiring that the 1981 Manual be revised entirely. 
  <p><li>The Real Property and Space Management Manual has been streamlined and 
    reorganized to serve as a supplement to the GSA Federal Property Management 
    Regulations and to reflect policies and procedures specific to the Federal Highway Administration. 
  <p><li>On November 17, 1986, the Assistant Secretary for Administration, Department 
    of Transportation, and the GSA Administrator signed a Memorandum of Understanding 
    governing the management of GSA-leased facilities. Policies and procedures 
    resulting from this delegation are set forth in this Manual. 
  <p><li>On December 4, 1986, the GSA issued revised regulations on smoking, which 
    are referenced in this Manual.

<p><li><u>DEFINITIONS</u> 
<ol type="a">
  <p><li><u>Capital Improvements</u> - improvements to realty which: 
  <ul>
    <p>(1)constitute an enlargement of a structure,   
    <p>(2)provide additional or enlarge facilities, or   
    <p>(3)constitute a major renovation or other substantial improvement 
      which materially increases the usefulness, productivity, or value of the 
      property or substantially extends its useful life. 
  </ul>
  <p><li><u>Capitalization</u> - estimation of the current market value of lands and buildings including improvements. 
  <p><li><u>Excess Holdings</u> - any work space or related furnishings which are 
    not essential to a Federal agency's existing or planned program. 
  <p><li><u>FHWA-Controlled Space</u> - any space which is owned or leased by the 
    FHWA. It also includes space for which authorities for acquisition, use, or 
    disposal have been delegated to the FHWA by the GSA. It includes any space 
    for which the FHWA does not pay the GSA or Department of Transportation (DOT) directly. 
  <p><li><u>GSA-Controlled Space</u> - space assigned by the GSA to the FHWA. It 
    includes any space for which the FHWA pays the GSA directly. 
  <p><li><u>Modular Furniture</u> - units of furniture which, when joined together, 
    occupy less space than conventional furniture. 
  <p><li><u>Occupant Emergency Plan</u> - a short-term emergency response program 
    involving occupants to minimize injury and loss of life and property in a specific facility. 
  <p><li><u>Occupiable Space</u> - that portion of the gross square footage of 
    space which is available for use by personnel or furnishings. 
  <p><li><u>Office Utilization Rate</u> - an indicator of the efficiency with which 
    office space is used. It is calculated by dividing the total occupiable office 
    square footage bythe total number of workstations occupying that space. To 
    account for space not used for office purposes, the utilization rate is adjusted 
    by subtracting a supplemental space factor. 
  <p><li><u>Open Bay Layout</u> - a type of layout in which workstations are situated 
    in space that is not divided by walls but may be sectioned off by partitions. 
  <p><li><u>Real Property</u> - any interest in land (including improvements to 
    the property, structures, and fixtures located on the premises) and appurtenances. 
    The FHWA Washington Headquarters holds title to all real property owned by the FHWA, except: 
  <ul>
    <p>(1) the public domain;   
    <p>(2)lands reserved or dedicated for national forest or national park purposes;   
    <p>(3)minerals in lands or portions of lands withdrawn or reserved 
      from the public domain which the Secretary of the Interior determines are 
      suitable for disposition under the public land mining and mineral leasing laws; and   
    <p>(4)crops when designated by the FHWA for disposition by severance and removal from the land. 
  </ul>
  <p><li><u>Related Personal Property</u> - any personal property which is located 
    on or is an integral part of real property. 
  <p><li><u>Space Planning</u> - the process of using recognized professional techniques 
    of space programming, planning, layout, and interior design to determine the 
    best location and most efficient configuration of space. 
  <p><li><u>Supplemental Space</u> - specific and discrete areas constructed as 
    office space but used to meet needs outside the agency's ordinary office requirements, 
    such as public-oriented or centralized reception, hearing or meeting facilities, 
    service, inspection, distribution and storage or processing activities. Such 
    space is most cost-effectively collated with normal office space. 
  <p><li><u>Supplemental Space Factor</u> - the average amount of supplemental 
    space per workstation. It is computed by dividing the square foot area of 
    supplemental space by the total number of workstations. 
  <p><li><u>Systems Furniture</u> - furniture specifically designed to accommodate 
    computer equipment in a minimum amount of space. 
  <p><li><u>Work Space</u> - federally-controlled space in buildings and structures 
    (permanent, semipermanent, or temporary) which provides an acceptable environment 
    for the performance of the FHWA mission requirements by employees or by other 
    persons occupying it. It is further classified as &quot;office space,&quot; 
    &quot;storage space,&quot; or &quot;special space.&quot; 
  <ul>
    <p>(1)Office space - space which provides an environment suitable in its present state for an office operation.   
    <p>(2)Storage space - space generally consisting of concrete, wood 
      block, or unfinished floors; bare block or brick interior walls; unfinished 
      ceilings; and similar construction containing minimal lighting or heating. 
      It includes attics, basements, sheds, parking structures, and other unimproved building areas.   
    <p>(3)Special space - space which has unique architectural features, 
      requires the installation of special equipment, or requires varying sums 
      to construct, maintain and/or operate as compared to office and storage space. 
  </ul>
  <p><li><u>Workstation</u> - a location within an office space assignment that 
    provides a working area for one or more persons during a single 8-hour shift. 
    The number of workstations in an office assignment is the number of such locations 
    that must be provided to support the maximum number of personnel housed in 
    that office space during any 8-hour shift. 
</ol></ol>
<p><center><font size="+1">CHAPTER 2. GSA-CONTROLLED SPACE</font></center>
<ol type="1">
<p><li><u>GENERAL</u>. This chapter prescribes policy and procedures for the assignment, 
  management, and release of space controlled by the General Services Administration (GSA) and assigned the FHWA. 
<p><li><u>ASSIGNMENT OF GSA-CONTROLLED SPACE</u> 
<ol type="a">
  <p><li><u>General</u>. The majority of the FHWA's office space needs are met 
    in GSA-assigned space. Requests for space shall be in accordance with space 
    utilization standards prescribed by the GSA. These standards are described in Chapter 4, Utilization of Work Space. 
  <p><li><u>Identification of Space Requirements</u>. When the need for new or 
    replacement space is identified, there are several considerations which should 
    be addressed during the initial planning stage. A geographical area consistent 
    with office mission should be defined. The GSA will generally assign space 
    in the central business area of the city in which the office is to be located. 
    Where practicable and cost-effective, the GSA may consolidate FHWA offices 
    with other departmental modes and/or other Federal agencies. Special mechanical, 
    electrical, and structural needs should also be addressed at this time. In 
    the case of leased renewals, the GSA will generally provide several months 
    advance notice at which time the servicing GSA regional office will solicit 
    from the FHWA regional office information on space requirements. 
  <p><li><u>Procedures to Request GSA Space</u> 
  <ul>
    <p>(1) FHWA field offices shall satisfy their space needs by submitting 
      a Standard Form (SF) 81, Request for Space, and SF-81A, Space Requirements 
      Worksheet (Attachment 1), to the GSA regional office responsible for the 
      geographic area in which space is required. A listing of the GSA regional 
      offices and the areas they service is contained in FPMR Subpart 101-17.48, 
      GSA Regional Offices. All requests must obtain prior approval from the Office 
      of Management Systems (HMS-1) by submitting a written request which includes 
      complete staffing and workstation patterns, justifications, floor plans, 
      if applicable, and a copy of the SF-81 and SF-81A. All SF-81's mustcontain 
      the following certification:   
    <p>&quot;We certify that the impact of the Balanced Budget and Emergency 
      Deficit Control Act of 1985 has been considered and it is our intention 
      to fulfill all financial commitments associated with this project.&quot;   
    <p>(2) The GSA may request submission of GSA Form 144, Net Space 
      Requirements for Future Federal Building Construction (Attachment 2), when 
      a space need may be satisfactorily met in a building proposed for construction. 
      Approval by HMS-1 should be obtained prior to submittal to the GSA.   
    <p>(3) When requesting space for the parking of Government-owned 
      motor vehicles not housed by the GSA, SF-81, Request for Space, shall be 
      submitted to the GSA; however, submission of SF-81A, Space Requirements 
      Worksheet, is not necessary. Prior approval from the Office of Management 
      Systems, Operations and Services Division, Property and Services Branch 
      (HMS-21), must be obtained by submitting a written request containing a 
      complete justification and a copy of the SF-81.   
    <p>(4) The FHWA shall not contact lessors or potential lessors for 
      the purpose of making oral or written representations, commitments, or agreements 
      with respect to the terms of occupancy of particular space, improvements, 
      alterations and repairs, or payment for overtime services unless such authority 
      has been delegated by the GSA. 
  </ul>
</ol>
<p><li><u>ALTERATION AND REPAIR OF GSA-CONTROLLED PROPERTY</u>. Generally, alterations 
  and repairs to GSA-controlled buildings are arranged for by the GSA on a reimbursable 
  basis. However, in some cases, responsibility for arranging alterations and 
  repairs may be delegated to the FHWA. HMS-21 is to provide policy guidance and 
  technical assistance in the design or reconfiguration of present layouts, when requested. 
<ol type="a">
  <p><li><u>Nondelegated Buildings</u>. Field offices have authority to arrange 
    with the GSA for alterations and repairs to existing space subject to the 
    availability of funds in their current allotments. If alterations result in 
    achange in the classification or amount of space, HMS-21 is to be advised 
    in advance in order that appropriate changes may be made to the Central Support 
    Budget and other records. During the alteration/repair process, copies of 
    all plans and correspondence forwarded to the GSA should be provided to HMS-21. 
    Minor changes and repairs, such as electrical outlets, need not be reported. 
  <p><li><u>Delegated Buildings</u>. In accordance with the lease management delegation 
    agreement between the Department of Transportation (DOT) and the GSA, the 
    FHWA is delegated certain responsibilities at designated locations where the 
    agency is the sole or primary occupant. Among these delegated responsibilities 
    is the optional authority to negotiate for lease alterations directly with 
    the lessor subject to the agreement's provisions and contingent upon the availability 
    of funds. The FHWA office desiring to exercise this authority should contact 
    HMS-21 for prior approval and guidance, except in the case of minor changes and repairs. 
</ol>
<p><li><u>BUDGETING AND EXPENDITURES FOR GSA-CONTROLLED SPACE</u> 
<ol type="a">
  <p><li><u>Budget Submissions</u>. Each responsible regional office should include 
    sufficient estimated amounts in the annual budget submissions to cover annual 
    alterations costs. The Office of Management Systems is responsible for budgeting 
    for Washington Headquarters alterations. These costs will be funded from the 
    fiscal year budget allotments issued by the Office of Fiscal Services (HFS-20). 
  <p><li><u>Space Charges</u>. Space charges, commonly referred to as the Standard 
    Level User Charge (SLUC) or, in more recent terms, &quot;RENT,&quot; are assessed 
    quarterly by the GSA for space assigned in GSA-owned or -leased property. 
    Rates, which are reviewed annually, approximate commercial charges for comparable 
    space and services. The Office of Management Systems is responsible for budgeting 
    for GSA space charges in all FHWA offices. The budget will be based on input 
    collected for the annual Work Space Management Plan and Budget Justification, 
    discussed inparagraph 6a, below. The office of Management Systems is also 
    responsible for review and payment of space charges. Periodically, or upon 
    request, HMS-21 will send each regional office an informational copy of the 
    billing for their respective space. 
</ol>
<p><li><u>RELEASE OF GSA-CONTROLLED SPACE</u>. The following procedures shall be 
  followed by FHWA offices when releasing excess GSA-controlled space. 
<ol type="a">
  <p><li>The FHWA office desiring to release excess space will request approval 
    from the Office of Management Systems (HMS-1). HMS-1 will obtain the necessary 
    approval from the Office of the Secretary of Transportation (OST) and will 
    authorize release of the space. 
  <p><li>After HMS-1 and OST approvals are received, the releasing FHWA office 
    shall notify, by letter, the appropriate GSA regional office. This notification 
    should contain a description of the space to be relinquished and the estimated 
    date of release. The GSA should be notified at least 120 days prior to the 
    estimated date of release. 
  <p><li>When a portion of space is released, the space shall be consolidated, 
    accessible, and readily assignable or marketable. Any expenses required to 
    alter the space shall be borne by the releasing FHWA office. The releasing 
    office shall contact the servicing GSA regional office to determine alteration requirements. 
  <p><li>A copy of all correspondence related to the release should be forwarded to HMS-21. 
</ol>
<p><li><u>REPORTING REQUIREMENTS</u> 
<ol type="a">
  <p><li><u>Work Space Management Plan and Budget Justification</u>. 
  <p> The Office of Management Systems will prepare annually a Work Space Management 
    Plan and Budget Justification, GSA Form 3530 (Attachment 3), which will be 
    submitted to the OST. This Plan supports the annual budget request to the 
    Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and enables the FHWA and the DOT to 
    establish square footage targets and report progress in achieving space management 
    goals. The Plan will contain estimates of office utilization rates, personnel 
    and workstations, work space, and space chargesand related obligation amounts 
    for the fiscal years covered by the corresponding budget cycle. All GSA-controlled 
    space will be reported. The data contained in the Plan will be consistent 
    with that contained in Annual Workstation Censuses, discussed below, and SF-81's, 
    Requests for Space. Preparation of this report requires the cooperation and 
    accurate input of all FHWA offices housed in GSA-controlled space. HMS-21 
    will solicit the information needed to prepare the Plan. 
  <p><li><u>Annual Workstation Census</u>. Each year, the GSA regional offices 
    should conduct a workstation census. A computer printout will be distributed 
    to each FHWA region. Regional Administrators or designees shall provide the 
    peak number of workstations to be housed during the fiscal year. Accurate 
    census reporting is important since it serves as the basis for justifying 
    space needs in each office. Unless otherwise indicated, printouts should be 
    returned to the appropriate GSA regional office within 30 days of receipt. 
    A copy of the census response to the GSA should be forwarded to HMS-21. 
</ol></ol>
<p><center><font size="+1">CHAPTER 3. FHWA-CONTROLLED SPACE</font></center>
<ol type="1">
<p><li><u>GENERAL</u>. This chapter prescribes policy and procedures for the purchase, 
  construction, management, and disposal of FHWA-controlled real property and space. 
<p><li><u>ACQUISITION BY PURCHASE OR CONSTRUCTION</u> 
<ol type="a">
  <p><li><u>Requests For Approval</u>. Requests to acquire real property, including 
    donated property, the title of which will be held by the FHWA, are to be submitted 
    to the Office of Management Systems, Operations and Services Division, Property 
    and Services Branch (HMS-21), by memorandum which includes a complete description 
    and intended use. Additionally, an operations and maintenance outline, estimate 
    of cost, and justification necessary to prepare GSA Form 1334, Request for 
    Transfer of Excess Real Property and Related Personal Property (Attachment 
    4), if appropriate, should be included. Such requests will be coordinated 
    with the Office of Fiscal Services (HFS-20) and the Office of Chief Counsel. 
    HMS-1will also obtain necessary approvals from the Office of the Secretary 
    of Transportation (OST). 
  <p><li><u>Congressional Approval</u>. Projects for acquisition or construction 
    of buildings involving an expenditure in excess of $500,000 require Congressional 
    approval in accordance with FPMR Section 101-1-.203, Approval of Projects. 
    Requests for such projects should be anticipated as far in advance as possible 
    and submitted to HMS-21 promptly so that they may be considered for inclusion 
    in an appropriate budget submission. 
  <p><li><u>Capitalization</u>. Land and buildings shall be capitalized using Form 
    FHWA-1036, Real Property Record (Attachment 5). AT the time of acquisition 
    or completion of construction, Form FHWA-1036 should be completed and forwarded 
    to HMS-21. Real property acquired pursuant to Title 23, U.S.C. 107 and 23 
    U.S.C. 317 for the States or foreign countries should not be capitalized. 
</ol>
<p><li><u>ACQUISITION BY LEASE</u>. In most cases, FHWA space needs will be met 
  by the General Services Administration (GSA) either in GSA-owned or GSA-leased 
  buildings; however, under special circumstances, the GSA may authorize the FHWA 
  to lease space. Federal Highway Administration offices shall not execute leases 
  without prior approval by the Office of Management Systems (HMS-1) who will, 
  in turn, seek assistance from the Office of Chief Counsel. A request for approval 
  should be in the form of a written request which includes staffing and workstation 
  patterns, justification, and floor plans, if applicable. 
<p><li><u>ALTERATION AND REPAIR OF FHWA-OWNED PROPERTY</u> 
<ol type="a">
  <p><li><u>Requests for Approval</u>. Prior to authorizing alterations to FHWA-owned 
    property, a detailed estimate of costs shall be prepared. If the estimated 
    cost exceeds $5,000 for a single structure or for any single project involving 
    several structures at one location, the estimate shall be submitted to HMS-21 
    for approval. Requests for approval must include the maximum estimated cost 
    and a statement as to whether funds are available for obligation. Alterations 
    or repairs costing less than $5,000 per structure or project may be authorized 
    locally, provided funds are available. 
  <p><li><u>Congressional Approval</u>. Alteration projects involving an expenditure 
    in excess of $500,000 require Congressional approval. Requests for such projects 
    should be anticipated as far in advance as possible and submitted to HMS-21 
    promptly so that they may be considered for inclusion in an appropriate budget submission. 
  <p><li><u>Capitalization</u>. Capital improvements to FHWA-owned property will 
    be reported on Form FHWA-1036, Real Property Record (Attachment 5) to HMS-21 
    upon completion of a project and payment of final costs. 
</ol>
<p><li><u>BUDGETING AND EXPENDING FUNDS FOR REAL PROPERTY</u> 
<ol type="a">
  <p><li><u>Budget Submissions</u>. Each responsible regional office and the Washington 
    Headquarters office should include sufficient estimated amounts in the annual 
    budget submissions to cover annual construction, acquisition, alteration, 
    repair, and maintenance of real property. These costs will be funded from 
    the fiscal year budget allotments issued by the Office of Fiscal Services (HFS-20). 
  <p><li><u>Expenditures for FHWA-Owned Property</u>. HMS-21 will administer the 
    expenditure of funds for real property costs for the Turner-Fairbank Highway 
    Research Center. The Direct Federal Program Administrator in Washington Headquarters 
    will administer the expenditure of funds for real property costs for the Vancouver, 
    Washington Equipment Depot. Expenditures for other than normal maintenance 
    and repair should be reported to HMS-21 prior to completion so that the records 
    can be adjusted. 
</ol>
<p><li><u>ACCOUNTABILITY RECORDS</u> 
<ol type="a">
  <p><li>HMS-21 is accountable for all FHWA real property holdings and maintains 
    official real property accountability records to support the general ledger 
    accounts maintained by HFS-20. 
  <p><li>No later than the last working day of each fiscal year, HMS-21 will forward 
    to HFS-20 a report in duplicate of real property owned by the FHWA for reconciliation 
    with the general ledger accounts. HFS-20 will review the report against its 
    accounts and indicate any necessarychanges on the carbon copy. This copy should 
    then be signed and returned to HMS-21. 
</ol>
<p><li><u>DISPOSAL OF EXCESS REAL PROPERTY</u>. The disposal of all FHWA-owned real 
  property shall be accomplished by the regional counsel responsible for the geographic 
  area in which the excess property is located. In most cases, the servicing GSA 
  regional office is the disposal agency, whereas the FHWA is the holding agency. 
  Federal Highway Administration offices desiring to dispose of excess owned property 
  shall follow the procedures set forth below. 
<ol type="a">
  <p><li>Prior to undertaking any disposal actions, approval must be obtained from 
    HMS-21 who will, in turn, obtain OST approval. 
  <p><li>After approval is received, the releasing FHWA office shall notify the 
    GSA regional office of the excess real property by completing Standard Form 
    (SF) 118, Report of Excess Real Property; SF-118a, Buildings, Structures, 
    Utilities, and Miscellaneous Facilities, Schedule A; SF-118b, Land, Schedule 
    B; and SF-118c, Related Personal Property, Schedule C (Attachment 6). HMS-21 
    is available for assistance in completing the SF-118 and the accompanying schedules. 
  <p><li>In addition to the SF-118, the FHWA releasing office shall prepare a report 
    on the title of the property in accordance with FPMR Section 101-47.202-2, Report Forms. 
  <p><li>The SF-118, accompanying schedules, and title report should be submitted 
    to the appropriate GSA regional office at least 90 calendar days in advance 
    of the date such excess property shall become available for transfer to other 
    Federal agencies or for disposal. 
  <p><li>The GSA will promptly notify the releasing office of the date this report 
    is received. Within 15 calendar days of receipt, the GSA will notify the releasing 
    office of the date of acceptance or the unacceptability of the report. 
  <p><li>The releasing office will retain custody and accountability for excess 
    real property, and shall perform the protection and maintenance functions 
    of such property pending its transfer or disposal. Responsibility for the 
    expense of protection and maintenance of such property shall not exceed 12 
    months, plus the period to the first day of the succeeding quarter of the 
    fiscal year after the date that the property is available for immediate disposition. 
  <p><li>Upon completion of all disposition actions by the appropriate FHWA regional 
    office and when the GSA has reassigned the ownership of the excess property 
    or disposed of it, the FHWA regional office shall submit a Form FHWA-1036, 
    Real Property Record (Attachment 5), to HMS-21 to indicate completion of the process. 
</ol>
<p><li><u>REPORTING REQUIREMENTS</u> 
<ol type="a">
  <p><li><u>Annual Work Space Management Plan and Budget </u><u>Justification</u>. 
    The Operations and Services Division (HMS-20) will prepare annually a Work 
    Space Management Plan and Budget Justification, GSA Form 3530 (Attachment 
    3), which will be submitted to OST. This Plan enables the FHWA and OST to 
    establish square footage targets, report progress and plans for achieving 
    space management goals, and supports the annual budget requests to the Office 
    of Management and Budget. The Plan will contain estimates of personnel and 
    workstations and amounts of work space in FHWA-owned property for the fiscal 
    years covered by the corresponding budget cycle. The data contained in the 
    Plan will be consistent with that contained in real property inventories, 
    discussed below. Preparation of this report requires the cooperation and accurate 
    input of all FHWA offices housed in FHWA-owned space. 
  <p><li><u>Annual Real Property Inventories</u>. On an annual basis, the Operations 
    and Services Division (HMS-20) is required to submit to OST inventories for 
    real property owned by or leased to the FHWA. Any FHWA office which directly 
    leases property (i.e., administers the lease and makes payments to the lessor) 
    shall prepare annually a GSA Form 1166, Quarterly Report of Real Property 
    Owned by or Leased to the United States (Attachment 7), for submittal to HMS-21. 
    Please note that although GSA Form 1166 is headed &quot;Quarterly Report of 
    Real Property Owned by or Leased to the United States,&quot; the reporting 
    requirement is annual. The GSA has not yet revised GSA Form 1166 toreflect 
    this change. HMS-21 will then prepare a Gsa Form 1209, Summary of Installations 
    Owned by or Leased to the United States (Attachment 8). For FHWA-owned property, 
    HMS-21 will prepare these same reports. The data contained in these reports 
    shall meet the requirements of FHWA Part 101-3, Annual Real Property Inventories. 
</ol></ol>
<p><center><font size="+1">CHAPTER 4. UTILIZATION OF WORK SPACE</font></center>
<ol type="1">
<p><li><u>GENERAL</u>. This chapter prescribes policies and procedures to be followed 
  in the planning and utilization of FHWA work space. 
<p><li><u>BACKGROUND</u>. Executive Order 12411, Government Work Space Management, 
  dated March 29, 1983, mandates the establishment of a program to reduce the 
  amount of Federal work space used or held to that amount which is essential 
  to agencies' missions. On April 29, 1985, the President signed Executive Order 
  12512, Federal Real Property Management, which expands the program to incorporate 
  Office of Management and Budget review and policy-setting responsibilities, 
  and further emphasizes the need to maximize Federal real property resources. 
  Utilization policies and procedures resulting from these Executive Orders are 
  contained in Federal Property Management Regulation (FPMR) Temporary Regulation 
  D-73, Quality Workplace Environment Program. 
<p><li><u>UTILIZATION STANDARDS</u> 
<ol type="a">
  <p><li><u>Efficient Utilization of Space</u>. FHWA offices should utilize space 
    to the maximum extent possible within mission requirements in order that space 
    costs can be held to a minimum. Methods to increase efficient utilization 
    of space include space reduction, relocation into space-efficient buildings, 
    consolidation with other Department of Transportation elements, and space-saving 
    alterations for existing buildings. Use of professional space planning techniques, 
    such as open bay layouts and systems of modular furniture, also increase utilization. 
    Space programming and planning services and interior design services are available 
    from the General ServicesAdministration (GSA) on a reimbursable basis. HMS-21 
    is also available to assist in this area. 
  <p><li><u>Office Utilization Rate</u>. All Federal agencies are required by the 
    GSA to achieve an adjusted office utilization rate of 135 square feet or less 
    per workstation. It should be noted that the 135-square-feet figure is a maximum 
    not to be exceeded and that often space assignments made by the GSA will fall 
    below this figure. Utilization rates are calculated by dividing the total 
    occupiable square footage by the total number of workstations occupying that 
    space. For example, in an office with 3,000 occupiable square feet and 20 
    workstations, the utilization rate is 150 square feet per workstation (3000 
    divided by 20). In order to account for areas not used for typical office 
    work, such as public reception areas, the GSA has assigned supplemental space 
    factors. These factors, which are discussed further below, are applied to 
    utilization rates in order to calculate adjusted utilization rates. 
  <p><li><u>Supplemental Space Factors</u> 
  <ul>
    <p>(1) The GSA has developed and approved supplemental space factors 
      for FHWA functions which are (a) housed in office space and accommodate 
      non-workstation activities, (b) used more than 50 percent of the time for 
      that purpose, and (c) in distinct and identifiable areas. The development 
      of these factors is based on space needs identified by regional offices 
      and Washington Headquarters. Supplemental space factors are used to determine 
      the appropriate amount of space that may be added to the 135-square-foot-per-workstation 
      goal to account for areas not used for typical office work. They are also 
      used to formulate adjusted utilization rates which serve as a means of tracking 
      the FHWA's progress in meeting the 135-square-foot goal. When a supplemental 
      space factor, expressed in square feet per workstation, is subtracted from 
      the office utilization rate, also expressed in square feet per workstation, 
      an adjusted office utilization rate is obtained. For example, in an office 
      with a utilization rate of 150 square feet per workstation and a supplemental 
      space factor of 17 square feet per workstation, the adjusted officeutilization 
      rate is 133 square feet per workstation (150 minus 17).   
    <p>(2) The GSA-approved supplemental space factors for the FHWA are as follows:   
    <ul>
      <p>(a)Washington Headquarters: 17 square feet per workstation; 
        <p>(b)Regional Offices: 43 square feet per workstation; and 
        <p>(c)Division Offices: 41 square feet per workstation. 
    </ul>  
    <p>(3) Supplemental space factors are a maximum and, in some cases, 
      may not even be used or may be significantly reduced by the GSA depending 
      on the space-efficiency of the building. FPMR Temporary Regulation D-73 
      should be consulted for further information on supplemental space factors 
      and their applications. 
  </ul>
</ol>
<p><li><u>PLANNING OFFICE SIZE</u>. Office size may be approximated by multiplying 
  135 square feet by the number of workstations in an office and adding the total 
  amount of supplemental space allowable. This figure equates to the maximum amount 
  of space an FHWA office can expect the GSA to approve in an office using conventional 
  building layouts and furniture. However, offices should be aware that in assignments 
  utilizing space-efficient layouts and systems or modular furniture, the GSA 
  may assign space at an adjusted utilization rate as low as 122 square feet per 
  workstation. The table, below, approximates the amount of space that may be 
  dedicated to specific functions and may be useful as a guide in planning appropriate office size.

  </tr>
</table>
<p><li><u>ALLOCATING SPACE WITHIN FHWA OFFICES.</u> The basis for assigning space 
  in FHWA offices should be determined by actual need within the confines of the 
  assigned block of space. As a general rule, private offices should be reserved 
  for personnel who meet regularly with subordinates and/or agency officials. 
  The open bay approach to planning workstation layouts should be utilized wherever 
  feasible as a space-saving measure. 
</ol>
<p><center><font size="+1">CHAPTER 5. BUILDING MANAGEMENT</font></center>
<ol type="1">
<p><li><u>GENERAL</u>. This chapter prescribes policies and procedures to be followed 
  in the management of both General Services Administration (GSA) controlled and FHWA-controlled space. 
<p><li><u>DELEGATION OF BUILDING MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY</u>. In most GSA-controlled 
  space, the GSA will provide or otherwise arrange for the services required to 
  house FHWA offices. IN areas where the GSA does not have a significant presence 
  and where the FHWA is the sole Federal tenant (or primary tenant occupying 90 
  percent or more of a GSA-leased facility), some of these responsibilities may 
  be delegated to the FHWA. Where such agreements have been made, the FHWA office 
  will be responsible for some or all of the following building management functions: 
<ol type="a">
  <p><li>perform periodic building inspections and maintain records of complaints 
    and resolutions to ensure lessor compliance with lease terms; 
  <p><li>verify utility bills prior to payment by GSA (where applicable); and 
  <p><li>negotiate rates for overtime services needed on a one-time or sporadic 
    basis and pay lessor directly for such services. 
</ol>
<p><li><u>SAFETY AND SECURITY</u> 
<ol type="a">
  <p><li><u>Accident and Fire Prevention</u>. Standards in all FHWA-occupied buildings 
    shall comply with Federal standards set forth by the Occupational Safety and 
    Health Act of 1970; Executive Order 12196, Occupational Safety and Health 
    Programs for Federal Employees, dated February 26, 1980; and 29 CFR Part 1960, 
    Subpart C - Agency Occupational Safety and Health Standards. FHWA Order 3902.3, 
    Occupational Safety Inspections and Abatements, dated May 5, 1978, prescribes 
    procedures for conducting periodic inspections of all FHWA-occupied workspace 
    and for the abatement of hazardous conditions. In all FHWA-occupied space, 
    a liaison shall be responsible for representing the FHWA with the building 
    manager or lessor, as appropriate. Further guidance on safety matters is available 
    from the Office of Management Systems, Occupational Safety Staff (HMS-4). 
  <p><li><u>Physical Protection and Building Security</u>. FHWA personnel shall 
    comply with all pertinent facility regulations and procedures set forth by 
    the building management in conjunction with the GSA Federal Protective Service 
    and/or local law enforcement agencies, as appropriate. 
  <ul>
    <p>(1) <u>Physical Security Review</u>. Each regional and division 
      office in the field and the Property and Services Branch (HMS-21) in Washington 
      Headquarters is responsible for determining physical security needs on a 
      case-by-case basis in conjunction with the servicing GSA Federal Protective 
      Service office. When obtaining new facilities, storage areas, or office 
      space, a physical security review of theproposed space should be conducted 
      to review the adequacy of physical security features and recommend any necessary 
      changes or additional measures. At this time, a liaison with appropriate 
      local law enforcement and GSA officials should be established.   
    <p>(2) <u>Occupant Emergency Program</u>. To safeguard life and property 
      in the event of a facility emergency, an occupant emergency plan shall be 
      developed, implemented, and maintained by the designated official of the 
      sole or primary occupant of a building with the assistance of the GSA. The 
      term &quot;emergency&quot; is used to describe such events as bomb threats, 
      civil disturbances, fires, floods, and other natural and human-caused disasters 
      with the exception of civil defense situations. The Office of Federal Protective 
      Service (FPS) in Washington, D.C., provides national policy program guidance 
      while regional FPS offices are responsible for annually reviewing the occupant 
      emergency plans and providing guidance, as requested. In leased space, the 
      GSA will solicit the assistance of the lessor in establishing and maintaining a plan. 
  </ul>
</ol>
<p><li><u>ACQUISITION AND DISPLAY OF FLAGS</u>. The GSA is responsible for flying 
  the U.S. flag at locations where the Federal Government is the sole occupant 
  and facility is operated by the GSA. The FHWA may display both the U.S. flag 
  and the DOT flag at FHWA-controlled locations. The U.S. flag is always displayed 
  with the DOT flag and is given precedence. The Federal Highway Administrator 
  is delegated authority by DOT Order 1000.7A, Departmental Flag, dated June 25, 
  1971, to designate locations where the flags are displayed. For details on acquisition 
  procedures, DOT Order 1000.7A should be consulted. HMS-21 may be contacted for 
  an updated listing of DOT flag stock numbers. U.S. flags are available from 
  the GSA Supply Catalog. 
<p><li><u>SMOKING</u>. FHWA offices are responsible for complying with the smoking 
  regulations set forth in Federal Property Management Regulation, Section 101-20.109-10, 
  Regulation of Smoking, Amendment D-85, dated December 4, 1986, and any additional 
  guidance provided by the Office of the Secretary of Transportation, the FHWA 
  Personnel Management Manual, and the GSA. The full cooperation of all employees 
  is requested toensure that the rights of non-smokers and smokers are addressed.
