The Honorable Pete Peterson
U.S. House of Representatives
426 Cannon Building
Washington, D.C. 20515-0902

Dear Congressman Peterson:

     This is in response to your inquiry on behalf of your
constituent, Mr. Nathan Lee Head, regarding the Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA).

     Mr. Head's letter expresses concern that legislation
regarding accessibility of facilities to people with disabilities
requires access to areas such as elevator pits, catwalks, below
ground storage and lube pits.

     While Florida's State law regarding accessibility may
differ, the ADA generally does not require such areas to be
constructed to be fully accessible. Rather, the Department of
Justice's ADA Standards for Accessible Design (Standards) provide
that areas used only as work areas need only be constructed to
allow individuals with disabilities to approach, enter, and exit
the areas. 28 C.F.R. part 36, Appendix A, § 4.1.1(3). In
addition, the ADA Standards provide that accessibility is not
required in non-occupiable spaces accessed only by ladders,
catwalks, crawl spaces, very narrow passageways, or freight
elevators and frequented only by service personnel for repair
purposes. Such spaces include elevator pits, elevator
penthouses, piping or equipment catwalks. 28 C.F.R. part 36,
Appendix A, § 4.1.1(5)(b)(ii).

     I hope this information is helpful to you in responding to
your constituent.
                                   Sincerely,


                                Deval L. Patrick

Dear Mr. Wodatch:

     I have enclosed for your review a copy of a letter from one of my 
constituents, Mr. Nathan Lee Head, regarding the Americans with Disabilities 
Act. This letter was forwarded to my by Florida State Senator Pat Thomas.

     Please keep me advised of any action which the Department will take or 
has already taken on the issues discussed in the letter. Your attention to 
this matter is greatly appreciated.

                                   Sincerely,


                                   Pete Peterson, M.C.

Tallahassee, Fl. 32399-1100

Mr. Thomas,

Please look into our Passage of Legislation under the
Handicap Disability Act, which I am totally in favor of.
However, some elments of this program should be reviewed
as the intent that was written into law such as making it
manditory to give handicap access to such normally dangerous
areas as elevator pits, catwalks, below ground storage and
lube pits. There are other areas which keep coming up in
the waiver process that should be looked into as this process
will show some of these areas which keep coming up and that
keep being waived doing nothing except adding to the cost of
doing business in Florida.

Thank You,

Nathan Lee Head,
