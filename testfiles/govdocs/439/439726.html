                          Introduction</b></p>
                        <p class="graycopy">Evidence of the multiple health benefits 
                          of regular physical activity continues to mount. Regular 
                          physical activity can help to prevent and manage coronary 
                          heart disease, hypertension, noninsulin-dependent diabetes 
                          mellitus, osteoporosis, obesity, and mental health problems 
                          (e.g., depression, anxiety). 16 Regular physical activity 
                          has also been associated with lower rates of colon cancer 
                          31 and stroke 34 and may be linked to reduced back injury. 
                          7 On average, physically active people outlive those 
                          who are inactive. 27 Regular physical activity can also 
                          help to maintain the functional independence of older 
                          adults and enhance the quality of life for people of 
                          all ages. 18</p>
                        <p class="graycopy">Because coronary heart disease is 
                          the leading cause of death and disability in the United 
                          States, the potential role of physical activity in preventing 
                          coronary heart disease is of particular importance. 
                          Physically inactive people are almost twice as likely 
                          to develop coronary heart disease as people who engage 
                          in regular physical activity. 32 This is only slightly 
                          less than the relative risk for such well-known risk 
                          factors as cigarette smoking, high blood pressure, and 
                          high blood cholesterol. Furthermore, more people are 
                          at risk for coronary heart disease due to physical inactivity 
                          than for any other single risk factor, and those with 
                          other risk factors for coronary heart disease, such 
                          as obesity and hypertension, may particularly benefit 
                          from physical activity.</p>
                        <p class="graycopy">Increasing evidence suggests that 
                          light to moderate physical activity, below the level 
                          recommended for cardiorespiratory fitness, can have 
                          significant health benefits, including a decreased risk 
                          of coronary heart disease. 21,33 For the inactive, even 
                          relatively small increases in activity are associated 
                          with measurable health benefits. In addition, light 
                          to moderate physical activity is more readily adopted 
                          and maintained than vigorous physical activity. Therefore, 
                          compared to the 1990 objectives, the year 2000 objectives 
                          place greater emphasis on reducing inactivity and increasing 
                          light to moderate physical activity.</p>
                        <p class="graycopy">The relationships between physical 
                          activity and health are numerous and complex. 8 Many 
                          different physiologic and physical effects are associated 
                          with the many different types of physical activities 
                          that a person can choose to do. While it is unclear 
                          what exact types and amounts of physical activity are 
                          required for precise health benefits, several health-related 
                          dimensions of physical activity are thought to be most 
                          important in producing selected health effects. 8 The 
                          year 2000 objectives are proposed to ensure that health-related 
                          dimensions of physical activity that encompass key physiologic 
                          and physical mechanisms become part of regular behavioral 
                          patterns.</p>
                        <p class="graycopy">For example, Objective 1.3 addresses 
                          the dimension of physical activity associated with energy 
                          or caloric expenditure which results in energy utilization, 
                          thereby enhancing weight loss or control. Pursuing activities 
                          that result in energy expenditure may also produce physiologic 
                          changes that favorably affect blood pressure, platelet 
                          aggregation and fibrinolysis, and glucose tolerance, 
                          thereby helping to prevent or manage coronary heart 
                          disease and diabetes mellitus. 20 Objective 1.4 addresses 
                          aerobic intensity which increases the ability of the 
                          cardiorespiratory and other systems to do physical work, 
                          but may also have an additional beneficial influence 
                          on preventing cardiovascular disease. Objective 1.6 
                          addresses muscular strength, muscular endurance, and 
                          flexibility which are important because they may protect 
                          against disability and, therefore, may serve to ensure 
                          regular physical activity participation. As research 
                          continues to elucidate the links between physical activity 
                          and selected health outcomes, individuals will be able 
                          to increasingly select physical activity patterns optimally 
                          suited to individual health risks and physiologic benefits 
                          as well as to individual preferences.</p>
                        <p class="graycopy">Unfortunately, few Americans engage 
                          in regular physical activity despite the potential benefits. 
                          Less than 10 percent of the U.S. adult population exercises 
                          at the level recommended by the 1990 objectives: &quot;exercise 
                          which involves large muscle groups in dynamic movement 
                          for periods of 20 minutes or longer, 3 or more days 
                          per week, and which is performed at an intensity of 
                          60 percent or greater of an individual's cardiorespiratory 
                          capacity.&quot; 9 Less than half the adult population 
                          exercises 3 or more days per week for 20 minutes or 
                          longer regardless of intensity of dynamic movement of 
                          large muscle groups. The prevalence of physical inactivity 
                          increases with advancing age especially during adolescence 
                          and early adulthood.</p>

                        <p class="graycopy">Physical activity is defined as any 
                          bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that results 
                          in caloric expenditure. 11 Caloric expenditure utilizes 
                          energy. Energy utilization enhances weight loss or control 
                          and is important in preventing and managing obesity, 
                          coronary heart disease, and diabetes mellitus. Engaging 
                          regularly in light to moderate physical activity for 
                          at least 30 minutes per day will help to ensure that 
                          calories are expended and confer health benefits. 21,33 
                          For example, daily physical activity equivalent to a 
                          sustained walk for 30 minutes per day would result in 
                          an energy expenditure of about 1050 calories per week 
                          (1.5 miles X 100 kcal per mile x 7 days per week = 1050 
                          kcal per week). If caloric intake remains constant, 
                          this would translate into a weight loss of roughly one-third 
                          pound per week. Furthermore, epidemiologic studies suggest 
                          that a weekly expenditure of 1000 calories could have 
                          significant individual and public health benefit for 
                          coronary heart disease prevention, especially for those 
                          who are originally sedentary. 20 </p>

                          for most people. Those willing and able can perform 
                          even more vigorous types of physical activity for the

                          likely to be adopted and maintained than intense activities,

                          caloric expenditure and may be important for those who 
                          cannot fit 30 minutes of sustained activity into their 
                          schedules. The point is to encourage physical activity 
                          as part of a daily routine. People engaging in light 
                          to moderate physical activity less often than daily

                          the acknowledged importance of lifetime physical activities 
                          outside the physical education class (60 percent) than 
                          within it. 40 The portion of the physical education 
                          curriculum devoted to lifetime fitness in 5th through 
                          12th grade is only 48 percent, 45 percent for boys and 
                          50 percent for girls. The average student is exposed 
                          to 5.6 different lifetime activities over a year's time. 
                          To a large extent, relays and informal games for younger 
                          students and competitive sports for older students are 
                          still the mainstay of the physical education program. 
                          More class time should be spent engaged in lifetime 
                          activities and more emphasis given to developing the

                          programs provide a mechanism for reaching large numbers 
                          of adults. Examples of such programs include onsite

                          on site or in conjunction with community organizations. 
                          Smaller worksites may prefer to align themselves with 
                          a community recreation facility in order to meet this 
                          objective. </p>
                        <p class="graycopy">Although varied, worksite fitness 
                          programs can increase the physical activity and fitness 
                          of program participants and improve employee health. 
                          17 Evidence that worksite programs are cost-effective 
                          is also growing. Such programs may even reduce employer 
                          costs for insurance premiums, disability benefits, and 
                          medical expenses. 37 Additional benefits for employers 
                          include increased productivity, reduced absenteeism, 
                          reduced employee turnover, improved morale, enhanced 
                          company image, and enhanced recruitment. Benefits to 
                          employers and the community can be further increased 
                          by including family members and retirees in worksite

                          achieved by offering a variety of physical activities, 
                          maximizing convenience, permitting employees to exercise 
                          on company time, or giving employees flexible time for 
                          use of the facilities. A promotion and education campaign 
                          can aid in recruitment. Incentives and awards for regular 
                          participation or achievement can help motivate people 
                          to continue. Employee involvement in planning and managing 
                          the program may also be important to program success. 
                          Special effort should be made to target sedentary and 
                          high-risk employees. Optimally, efforts to promote physical 
                          activity and fitness at the worksite should be part

                          activity depends in part on the availability and proximity 
                          of community facilities and conducive environments. 
                          As facility distance from residence increases, use generally 
                          decreases. People are unlikely to use community resources

                          of exercise facilities would help them become more involved

                          6.25 to 10.5 acres of developed open space per 1,000 
                          people (or 1 managed acre for every 95 to 160 people).

                          departments found that the average number of citizens 
                          per managed acre was 553, well over the standard of 
                          95 to 160. 25 The average for small, medium, and large 
                          communities were 345, 1,147, and 312 citizens per acre, 
                          respectively. (Small communities were defined as fewer 
                          than 25,000 people, medium as 25,000 to 100,000 people,

                          county park and recreation departments provide fitness 
                          trails, 29 percent provide hiking trails, 21 percent 
                          provide bicycle trails, and 15 percent provide snow 
                          trails. For departments with trails, the average number 
                          of miles for all trail types combined is 23, but the 
                          median is only 6 miles. Where trails are provided, the 
                          average number of citizens per trail mile ranges from

                          to 28,941 for fitness trails. Including areas without

                          trail mile per 59,000 citizens, 1 biking trail mile 
                          per 91,000 citizens, and 1 fitness trail mile per 63,000

                          respectively. For departments providing pools, the nunmber 
                          of citizens per pool averages 29,850. Including areas 
                          served by departments that do not provide pools yields 
                          a national estimate of roughly 1 public pool per 53,000

                          in regular exercise. 15 However, physical activity assessment 
                          and counseling is not yet routine practice for most 
                          primary care providers. In 1983, less than half of primary 
                          care physicians were found to &quot;routinely&quot; 
                          inquire about their patients' exercise habits. 44 A 
                          more recent national survey of internists found that 
                          although 66 percent routinely obtained and recorded 
                          the patterns of exercise for patients new to their practice, 
                          exercise counseling was provided to fewer than one-third 
                          of all sedentary patients. 1 Furthermore, when exercise 
                          was discussed with patients, less than three minutes 
                          typically was spent on the subject. A meta-analysis 
                          of 7 physician surveys (including 2 national surveys 
                          of family practitioners), 1 chart audit study, and 2 
                          consumer surveys also estimated that physicians provide 
                          exercise counseling for roughly 30 percent of sedentary 
                          patients. 22 </p>
                        <p class="graycopy">Though few studies have evaluated 
                          the effectiveness of physical activity counseling by 
                          primary care physicians or other providers, 36 percent 
                          of the patients at one intervention site where physicians 
                          were trained to counsel had begun a program of regular

                          physical activity counseling in clinical settings comes 
                          from cardiac rehabilitation programs where exercise 
                          compliance rates of 50 percent at 6 months are typically 
                          observed. 12 Because of the potential benefit, the U.S. 
                          Preventive Services Task Force recommended that clinicians 
                          counsel all patients to engage in a program of regular 
                          physical activity tailored to their health status and

                          design an effective program should refer patients to 
                          a preventive medicine specialist, a certified exercise

                          and advise patients about physical activity. A standardized 
                          set of questions, prescriptions, and counseling protocols 
                          would facilitate attainment of this objective as would

                          through professional preparation curricula and continuing

                          effective in increasing counseling by providers. Several 
                          studies have shown that the activity levels of physicians 
                          are associated with their physical activity counseling

                          as community leaders, can encourage schools to provide
